- Post Title: Please Help me opening Continent of the ninth r3m files ...

Well, first of all continet of the ninth is not really famous yet, so I'm going to introduce a little bid

Continet of the Ninth is a non-targeting action rpg game developed in Korea.

It was released in korea by Hangame, in 2009, 2011 in Japan by Gamechu.

Right now it's going to have its first close beta test in North America in 1st Q of 2012

The game file is encrypted with cfs format, but I can open it...

It has r3cm ( character mesh), r3ce (animation), r3cb(skeleton), dds(texture) and r3m...

well, I can take a look at all of those with blender except r3m which is a map mesh. 

can anyone help me please? 

I'm not a programmer so I can't write script...
