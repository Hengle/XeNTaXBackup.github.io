Use filecutter on the mesh data file.

I doubt there's anything useful in a supposed map file.

What tool did you use?
Guess they don't use filenames, which makes it difficult to assign material.

I still want a filecutter version of the mesh.dat file though.

No type checking.

A single file seems to have multiple models, or at least, versions of the model.
I simply loaded everything, so some of them may look weird.

> some files not load

If it doesn't load, upload them.
I'm not getting the game since it's apparently 8 GB

Also work on getting the first and last 1 MB of the mesh.dat

Another option is to just manually copy bytes into another file.

Don't know maybe the person that wrote the unpacker has a better idea.
