- Post Title: Golden Valley File Extract

used to be able to extract Unity3D files from this mobile game called Golden Valley: City Build Sim using Unity Asset Bundle Extractor, but for some reason the tool can no longer read the bundle files from the game's latest update. I need some assistance in figuring out what went wrong. Were the files encrypted or something? Here are the file samples: [link](https://www.mediafire.com/file/bw4z74317lncov7/Golden+Valley+File+Samples.zip/file)

Never mind. Looks like someone else from another site was able to help me out.

That was me they're referring to!  The solution was that the files work fine in Asset Studio
