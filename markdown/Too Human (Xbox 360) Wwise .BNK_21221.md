Hi guys, I hope you can help me with unpacking [these nonstandard audio banks](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pF_3UKosreHTWKmsKD0PYEWxTFdYxQgc/view).
Here's a list of tools / scripts that don't work:

[A BMS script by Nicknine](https://pastebin.com/MhRD1s5T);
[A BMS script by AlphaTwentyThree(Alpha23)](https://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=13&t=4450&p=89662#p89662);
[A program by eXpl0it3r](https://github.com/eXpl0it3r/bnkextr/releases);
[A program by CHE@TER (CHEATER from CTPAX-X Team)](http://ctpax-cheater.losthost.org/personal/bnkextr.zip);
[RExtractor.exe from RavioliGameTools v2.10](http://www.scampers.org/steve/sms/other.htm#ravioli_download).

I wish you the best of luck with these banks!
Bye!

I'm not sure exactly how the filenames are referenced, but my attached script should extract the audio files at least.  Hope that helps for now!
