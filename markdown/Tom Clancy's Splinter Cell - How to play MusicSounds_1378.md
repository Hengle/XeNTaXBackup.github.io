I have looked at these a little once before - I think they are special sound files or something like that. I could have a poke around if you like, but I can almost guarentee that even if I do get something out of them, they will be unusable.

Guys, I'm begging you on my knees, I need to extract the music from Splinter Cell 1 and 2. I've extracted the music from Splinter Cell 3 easily, but the two methods of doing it don't work with 1 and 2. The first method was using Nova Software Extractor 2.4 - the second method was simply changing the music files' extention to .OGG, and playing them in Winamp (only Winamp's OGG plugin would play them, for some reason). These mothods don't work with Splinter Cell 1 and 2... I have been racking my brains, trying ANYTHING for 4 years now. There's gotta be a way, come on... PLEASE!

I can't believe nobody wants to help. Some of the most amazing game music, and we can't play it outside the game... There's GOTTA be a way!

It's not that we don't want to try to figure it out, it's mostly that we don't have much time, and we don't have any audio file experts amongst us that I'm aware of.

Chaos theory have a 3 differents type of audio:

Ogg vorbis (the music) rename the extension to ogg
Some raw audio (some voices and effects) 
Unknow compressed  (the ambient sound) (?)

So there's no way to find out how the music is compressed in Splinter Cell 1 and 2? Maybe with a hex editor, I don't know? I REALLY would love to be able to extract the music files, I mean it would be like the Holy Grail for me.

This entry doesn't give much hope, does it? Or is there still a way? [http://wiki.xentax.com/index.php/Splinter_Cell_LS0](http://wiki.xentax.com/index.php/Splinter_Cell_LS0)
