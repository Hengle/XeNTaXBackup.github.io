- Post Title: Similarity that can't be a coincidence

A slightly disturbing discovery I've made while trying to figure out the file format used by Quick Click Games: It's resemblance to Frogwares' format is quite uncanny. Both use the split directory format (one with file data and the other with directory names), extension groups, and almost even the same fields (Quick Click's has an additional field). The only major difference is Quick Click's format "signs" the archives using XOR to obfuscate the directory offset and puts an extra value for validation. Man, it's weird. I bet there's someone in one of the companies who've worked for both.

Could it be they use stuff like Gamemaker Studio?

Interesting point. Though the last time I looked at Gamemaker they were using Delphi and encrypting entire data files. Of course, things might have changed.
