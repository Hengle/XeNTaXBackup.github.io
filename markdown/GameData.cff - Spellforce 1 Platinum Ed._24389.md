- Post Title: GameData.cff - Spellforce 1 Platinum Ed.

I know there are a couple of editors for GameData.cff file of this game for modding purpouses, But I think none of them is able to edit the dialogs of the game. I want to translate the latest version (1.61) of this game. Does anyone know how to access the dialogs inside this file (Gamedata.cff)?

Can you send links or name few of those editors?

Also, can you upload this "Gamedata.cff" file for analysis?
