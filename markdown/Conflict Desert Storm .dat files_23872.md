You would need to reverse engineer hash function and brute force it or debug it to get the filenames.

Any known progress on creating tools for unpacking .dat files with known filenames?

I've made another topic about Pivotal Games' Conflict .dat archives which Ekey made an alternate tool for me: [viewtopic.php?f=10&t=24817&p=180669](https://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=24817&p=180669)
