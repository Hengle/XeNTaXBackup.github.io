- Post Title: adding new localization for Metro Exodus

hello!

by [rengareng's tool](https://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=19520), I was able to extract metro's archives, now I need to put the files back -need to repack it-

so how can I repack the extracted files, or at least add the new localization to the game?
