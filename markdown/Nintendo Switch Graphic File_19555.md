Hi, you can use this tool [https://github.com/aboood40091/XTX-Extractor](https://github.com/aboood40091/XTX-Extractor) to convert from 'NvFD' to .DDS.
Just rename this files to *.xtx a drag/drop at xtx_extract.py and generate to .DDS editable file. After you finish than just drag/drop .DDS file and it will make .XTX file  With this i have been completely edit Dark Souls Remastered translate.
