Blind guesses have been leading me nowhere, it's a dead end because I can't figure out how it's compressed, so I have to learn to disassemble the game, which is a whole science in itself and pretty different from what I'd been doing before and likely to take months or more (though it'd benefit me for future projects to be sure) unless someone else figures out what I haven't. Noesis works fine though, so if you wanna see the anims just use that.
