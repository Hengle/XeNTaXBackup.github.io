- Post Title: 2k PS3 Era files

Thanks to Aluigi and his apf script, I was able to extract the 0A, 0B, etc files. Only issue is that they're all .dat files. From what I quickly gathered from researching is that you need a specifc file tied to the game, like a .dll file(?), but since it's not a pc game it doesn't have one obviously. Still, is it possible to unpack .dat files? It's from nba 2k8. I have one of the larger .dat files below.
