- Post Title: Dead Island .MESH Files How to import

So i recently wanted to extract dead island assets and came come across the chrome r6 extractor, I tried it and got all the textures, as well as a bunch of other assets too

the meshes come out as:
[https://ibb.co/c83xjJT](https://ibb.co/c83xjJT)
[https://ibb.co/hsrRdpZ](https://ibb.co/hsrRdpZ)
0.Mesh
1.MeshFixup
2.VertexDara
3.IndexData
4.Skin
5.SkinFixups

here is a sample of a woman [https://www.mediafire.com/file/ti7ukeyc ... a.rar/file](https://www.mediafire.com/file/ti7ukeycf8ocxa5/woman_a.rar/file)

Here's Act 1 Sample [https://www.mediafire.com/file/6em3ett3 ... k.rar/file](https://www.mediafire.com/file/6em3ett3kifxmbh/act1a_PC_unpack.rar/file)

any idea on what can open a .mesh file tried the xps one but didn't work so must be unknown.

2.VertexData contains a decent point cloud (but couldn't make sense of the 3.IndexData):

(0.Mesh seems to contain a hat/point cloud.)

IndexData
using your results  
if find for the number of vertices in the "0.Mesh" file.
0x159660 >> "2661,237012,2941612..."
the offset is written there for them, and for indices.
