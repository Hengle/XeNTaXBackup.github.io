Yeah I've duked around this for a while as well and I think it's due to most of the korean lithtech FPS games using a somewhat different format for their characters compared to the models that can be found in nolf tron and AVP. Even looking at he files in a hex editor I can clearly see that the combat arms LTB models have a bunch of extra data. If one found what exactly this is, and strip it out, Ithink you could actually get it to convert in the LTB2x tool

As far as I recall you had to pitch models trough one prog - I'm sure to have it somewhere and then you can use the lTA or LTB importer. The only thing you have to do is rotate the bones themselves, but they are there.

The lack of UVW maps is proving a bit of a hassle though. Been unwrapping one of the model myself for a while now, but the textures are that awesome.

to junk angel, what's that program? Also.. haw can you extract the .rez archives of the game? In order to get the original files of that game (models, textures, e.t.c) you need to extract the game archives first, they are .rez and I haven't seen any extractor, tool or even a bms script that can do so for those...

If you send me a sample rez file I can take a look at it.
Though as the models go, I'm still waiting on Tosyk,

About lta import. You can use ms3d 1.6.4
Here is how to extract CF rez. My friend tell me how to do this and him not allow me to share it. I had promised with him.

Maybe you can find this metahook extract any where in chinese side. Because it leaked

Well. I really hope we can convert LTA (animations) to order format like SMD.   
LTA information can view with notepad. LTB information can view with hex editor.
LTB-to-X for convert mesh
LTA import for convert bone

Well duked around witht he crossfire models once more and it seems that the majority actually do convert just fine with LTB2X. 
Was just confused since all the models I wanted to get, didn't work.

So I recommend folks to try that.

So if I have understand right:
1. there is a way to extract the files from the  *.rez archives.. and you know that way.
2. you can import those models whit bones...
3. you're not willing to tell how to extract those archives?

Is that right? In that case there's no wonder why no one is willing to help. You are asking from someone to give you something just like that, whith nothing to give in return.
