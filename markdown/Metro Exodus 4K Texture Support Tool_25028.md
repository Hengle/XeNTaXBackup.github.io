- Post Title: Metro Exodus 4K Texture Support Tool

I have updated Prodnik's old Metro Exodus texture converter tool to support the 4k textures that were released last year.
Many thanks to Prodnik for providing the source code.


[HOW TO USE]

Use the MetroEX tool from this post [viewtopic.php?f=10&t=19520&hilit=metro+exodus](https://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=19520&hilit=metro+exodus) to browse and extract .4096 files from the Metro Exodus archive.

Place the .4096 files and the contents of the ConverterMetroExodus4K.7z in the same folder and execute the 3.bat file
This should convert all .4096 files to .DDS files. You can use Noesis, XnViewMP or Paint.NET to view and convert the textures into your desired format.

Get the tool here [https://www.dropbox.com/s/jcw9dz53tn4f7 ... 4K.7z?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/jcw9dz53tn4f78z/ConverterMetroExodus4K.7z?dl=0)
