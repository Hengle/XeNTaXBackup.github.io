- Post Title: Gordon Ramsay DASH: How to crack password for the database (.db) files?

Hi, I'm currently stuck on how to crack the passwords for the following files: [https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/ ... sp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1jDHXJ7UrdR9t54PcF8aNfCRVOeIWRhwT?usp=sharing)
Afaik the game uses them to store info for real name of the asset files since they are in hashes, and also the text description of everything in the game, which can be proven upon opening the files with Notepad++.
Here's the game's main lib file: [https://drive.google.com/file/d/194Kja6 ... sp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/194Kja6XXHwE4AZrnCm3SxHBkObqvjcdW/view?usp=sharing) which the game uses to decrypt the files. The full lib folder can be viewed here: [https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/ ... sp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1DJX3Xj5PQ5qg3CFpe2Pc8_cXUjr_0hsA?usp=sharing)
Any help would be appreciated! Thanks in advance!
