I need a BMS script that extracts yobj files properly. If the yukes.bms file works, let me know.

Also the yukes .yobj importer always gives me "msh FN error."

Not sure why you would bother asking, since you could have easily used the yukes.bms script and found that it works.  

Also, are you trying to import Xbox 360 .yobj files, since that is what the importer is made for, which is explained in that thread too?

I tried that already. It was even Xbox 360 files. Everytime it's the same thing.

"msh FN error"

Are the files corrupted or what?



P.S. When I use quickbms with the script, after it finishes extracting the files, I get the "QuickBMS has stopped responding" error and it closes. That's why I asked in the first place. Also I am using 3ds max 2011

Actually, The Endian plugin won't load because of this problem.

Are these the character model files in the \pac\ch\ folder, or some other pac file in the game?  Also, I know the plugin was made for 3ds Max 2010, but works on some older versions, not sure if it works on 3ds Max 2011, but you will need the Endian plugin to work or it definitely won't work.

I can not help you with anything, unless you say what file you are working on.

I am working on pac/ch/. If it helps, I can just try the plugins on 3ds max 2010.

Sorry. I just found out from chrrox that you need to run rumbleroses2.ms then the .yobj importer.

but everytime i run it, this happens:

--Syntax error: at bad, expected <factor>
--In line: fname = "C:\\float2txt\\rumble roses\\test.yobj"

What needs to change to fix this?

Sorry to bump this, but i need help.

edit: Actually, I need a .yobj importer that works with newer .yobj files.
