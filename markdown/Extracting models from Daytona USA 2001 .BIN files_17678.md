- Post Title: Extracting models from Daytona USA 2001 .BIN files?

Hello everyone! I have always wanted to get the models (and their textures) from the game, and even extracted all the files from the disc. However, while the files I apparently want are there (like CARS_POL.BIN), I have no idea how to extract the models or files inside it. For now I have only checked using the US version, which a friend told me that apparently uses a compressed propietary archive, which doesn't have anything legible on the text. However, I'm going to see if I can check any clues in the Japanese version; but until then, thanks for any answers.
