- Post Title: Finding a Berkanix Online Game Client

Good afternoon, dear forum users.
The royal client game berkanix Online.
All the links that I found they are no longer working. In the subject of the Rimbros user - [viewtopic.php?f=16&t=9283&hilit=Berkanix+Online](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=9283&hilit=Berkanix+Online) did not receive a response from the host. So I decided to turn to the forum if anyone has this miracle of creation. I am even ready to pay the amount for this.
Thanks in advance.
Sorry for my English.

You might laugh, but I do have this client xD I will upload it, but expect in to be done with some time lol My uploading speed is quite poor - and client is 4.42 GB in size! For sure it's not latest client, if there was such one lol but still better than nothing, right?

Unfortunately anyone who has a client divides into:
1. Want money
2. Disappear

Fall of gamedev
