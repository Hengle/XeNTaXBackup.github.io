- Post Title: Tsubasa Dream Team Game (Paid)

Hello guys,
I'm trying to open in Dev X Development the files from Captain Tsubasa Dream team Game.
I was able to extract the main assets which are in the apk file nothing usable, however the data downloaded are obfuscated/encrypted and i'm not able to decrypt them.
Anyone can help me? I can spend at least 50 usd  ( yeah yeah, i know its deserve a lot more, but i am from brazil and this is already a lot for me ).
Thanks for you time.
