- Post Title: Tekken Tag Tournament 2 Models [Request]

I am trying to extract models from Tekken Tag Tournament 2 Xbox 360 version. I know it has been done before, but I am having trouble using xbdecompress.exe in to decompress the .bin files in order to extract the files. There are not very many detailed tutorials for xbdecompress or any pictures showing where I am messing up at. I would greatly appreciate any help with my problem here. By the way, I have a list of character models that I have been unable to acquire so if there are new links or have been newly ripped from the game, I would be very grateful. Please note that this list is in no particular order.

Thanks,
spartanmark6
