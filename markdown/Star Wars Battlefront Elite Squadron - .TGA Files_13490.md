- Post Title: Star Wars Battlefront Elite Squadron - .TGA Files

After extracting the MAINMENU.GUI file from Star Wars Battlefront Elite Squadron, I get some .TGA files that can't be opened.

[http://www.mediafire.com/download/7bmdr ... aphics.zip](http://www.mediafire.com/download/7bmdr7r17698dyh/graphics.zip)

I'm particularly interested in these "Italian" files because I believe these images are leftover SWBF3 logos. There's already a leftover SWBF3 logo in the ISO called NEWDATA_ITALIAN.

Thanks in advance!

would be helpful if you told us the assumed resolution (x*y) of the pictures

You mean the resolution of the image? I think it's 512x512.

So it's just a garbled up Elite Squadron logo? Oh well, thanks for the help though.
