Hmm, is it from EA? You could try and open it as FIFA200x or C&C Generals... , if it works , let me know here. Perhaps it is the same format!

Well, I noticed there is no demo. That's too bad, because I rely heavily on them, I can't go out and buy every game just to implement a new format.

No, didn't see any demos of MVP Baseball either.  Do you need the whole game or just a .big file to make a version that reads the MVP files?
