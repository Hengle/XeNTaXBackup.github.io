- Post Title: Barbie DreamHouse Party .HNK Files - PC Version

I buy Barbie DreamHouse Party, for capturing the main house stage, but i can't get with 3D Ripper DX ( Unhandled exception Crash ), extracted model succesfully with Ninja Ripper ( but the stage is untidy and i get duplicated meshes).

There are many HNK files ( located in a folder called HunkFiles )... some idea for opening these archives ?

Hi! I have the same question. How can I open HNK files? These files are from a different game called: "How to Train Your Dragon 2". 
I attached the extracted game files below.

Can anyone help?

You may be able to rip the model thought hex2obj, use fallingskies bms script to unpack the files for Xbox version or use the scripts in this post:[viewtopic.php?f=10&t=12420](https://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=12420) to unpack the ps3 version(it also have a texture convertion) put the rendermodeltemplate or the hnk itself in hex editor to find vertices and faces
