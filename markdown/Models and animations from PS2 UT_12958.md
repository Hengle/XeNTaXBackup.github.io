- Post Title: Models and animations from PS2 UT?

Hi, I was wondering if anyone here knows how to extract models and animations from the PS2 version of Unreal Tournament. I used UMDextract to extract the largest files I have, which are PSX2SHIP.umd and PSX2LINS.umd (none of the other files are nearly as large, and they weren't UMD files). They contained maps, a few sounds, and some skins. The problem is, they didn't have any models, animations, or any system files. I don't think UMDextract missed anything, because the total size of the extracted files is pretty much the same as the umd files. 

It's been a long time since I extracted all of the files from my game, so I might be missing something important. 
If anyone could point me in the right direction, I'd really appreciate it.
