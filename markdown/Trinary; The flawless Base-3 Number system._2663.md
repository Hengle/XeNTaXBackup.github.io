- Post Title: Trinary; The flawless Base-3 Number system.

First of all, hello and thank you for having me. I'm not sure that there is a whole lot I can do to help, but I'm glad to be a member and I'll do what I can!

I spent the last several months creating and refining a functional base-3 numeric system to replace Binary as a computer language. It is flawless and dozens of times more efficient. The question now is: Who do I take it to first? I plan on going to a microchip company before the year is out. Any opinion on who I should do to and why?

Again, thanks for having me. I look forward to working with you all and hope there's at least somethin I can do to help.

Luck and wishes,
-Atrusino

This was mostly just to say hi, but I wouldn't mind doing so. I got a challenge by the teacher of ym first college class to convert my phone number to Binary. I did it.. He then offered me the next night a new challenge: "Cool! Now do it in Trinary"
Being a lover of math I looked up Trinary so I could make my conversion.. There's no such thing. So I invented it.

What this is: A 3 state switch system that uses 3 places instead of two as in classic binary. With a logic (research I can't afford to do) and some new hardware, it could easily become the most efficient computer language there is. I just stumbled onto a tansistor that will do the job of carrying three states, so I am going to lay out what I have and take it to a microprocessor company and try to get involved in a researcg project to advance what I already have. My invention was the order of number needed to make the 3 state switch work. After months of theory I came up with it and it's been uphill since.

I'm not very good at explaining, but if anyone has any more specific questions, I'd be happy ot answer them. I apologise for the delayed reply. I've been away for the last week.

Luck and wishes,
-Atrusino

I am intrigued. Given that a highly flexible programming language [already exists](http://www.antwon.com/other/malbolge/malbolge.txt) for your system, you might be sitting on a real winner here.

Because of the nature of the new number system: Hardware, Software, Computer Languages, Networking systems and Operating systems will all need to be redesigned. Similar to bumping windows to 64bit only... 100x harder and a bit more expensive.

What I don't get is: How did you "create" a base-3 system? Base-n systems are well known since... I don't know, the middle ages or something? I remember doing arbitrary base-n calculations in school when I was about 10.

What's so revolutionary about your implementation of base-3? I guess you can do calculations a bit more "efficient" (i.e. it takes less cycles to multiply 2 numbers, for example), but at the cost of added complexity in the CPU ALU. I don't think it'll be worth it. And if you want to completely ditch backward-compatibility with all existing systems, all hardware manufacturers will laugh at you.

But I'm interested anyway 

You said you'll answer questions. So here is what I'm particularily interested in:
*Is your computer a von Neumann architecture or Harvard, or something completely new?
*Or are you simply talking about gates (like and/or/not/nand/add/...) which you "changed" from accepting and delivering binary to trinary?
*What is that trinary transistor you're talking about?
*How do you "encode" the 3 states on a wire? 0V, 1V, 2V voltage levels? or more like 0V, -5V, +5V? Or do you use currents/frequency modulation/... to represent them?

Oh, and btw, simply re-designing computers to work in base-3 instead of base-2 won't magically create the "most efficient programming language ever". If your language is turing-complete, it is exactly as powerful as C (or any other significant language out there).

As a sidenote, there are actually already "thing"s in hardware-land which use base-n calculations right now. For example WiFi uses QPSK (quad phase shift keying), which can be seen as working in base-4. And Hamming codes (used on CDs and in image encoding for example)  work in almost any base, for example Hamming(11,7) is base 128 code...

Ah, the very reason that I have almost no time to post here.. This system will, in time, allow a computer to say 'Why?'
The system itself has possibilities, but as you said.. Changing to use just the system alone is impractical.. The costs along would be rediculous.. However, my research has mostly been going into that big question.. "Why?" Once I figure out how to make that work.. AI will no longer be a thing of the future.

I could make my C64 ask "why?" over 15 years ago:

```
20 goto 10
```

Ok, jokes aside 

The thing is: Everything you develop with/for your base-3 system, I can write a program to "emulate" or "simulate" whatever your system does on a "standard" computer. So if you say "AI will be a reality with trinary", I can then implement the same on a "standard" computer, even if it's a bit slower because you can do whatever you do more efficient in base-3.

Since you didn't answer my questions I have some more, now that you brought up AI.
* How does your AI system differ from previous AI/logic programming languages? Especially how do you want to overcome the difficulties which basically stopped research with Lisp, Prolog and SHRDLU more than 10 years ago? (i.e. deduction from a database, efficient storage of "knowledge" data, deduction of new deduction rules from old ones, etc.)

Edit: Oops, didn't notice that I used the wrong tags there...

The only AI that I've ever seen in the works doesn't truly 'understand' anything that it isn't programmed to undestand. An example is the way bots work in a video game.. They know to resolve certain paths to locate a player and when they locate them, they know to use a certain weapon to attempt to kill them. But the 'AI' there doesn't understand why it has to do that. I'm talking about an actual conscience that is capable of understanding the nature of a problem and not just the problem.

Blah blah you're avoiding questions and basically talking out of your ass at this point. Either tell us how you intend to solve this AI problem, and why you would need a trinary system to solve it (which you don't), or go bore someone else.

Exactly what I wanted to say just now. I already thought so right after the first post, but I wanted to give him another chance  I thought maybe he was so busy coding/developing his trinary system that he didn't have much time to post here.

But now it's pretty obvious that he has no clue what he's talking about.

@Atrusino: Good luck in getting anyone to buy your shiny new invention. And I'm already keen on seeing and communicating with your 'trinary' AI. I hope it'll be smarter than Eliza, and, who knows, maybe it even passes the Turing-Test

Neural nets are one approach for all kinds of decision-making systems, even "learning" ones, but they have their share of practical problems as well; just as an example: NNs tend to become relatively large in order to gain meaningful results for non-trivial problems. This leads to difficult learning phases, where highly complex optimization problems have to be solved to effectively train the system parameters. In practice, this can often only be done approximatively, without a guarantee of optimality.

I'm no expert in AI, but the pattern recognition folks usually tend to look for systems with fewer parameters and a structure that is more closely adapted to the problem at hand (like hidden markov models with underlying language models in speech recognition, for example). NNs do generally not have a problem-specific structure, thus they need fine-tuned input data and much computing capacity.

(That is not to say that NNs are a bad idea. As most techniques they have their use and have been -- and probably still are -- a topic of research. I'm curious what the future will bring, but there is still a variety of other approaches.)

Anyway, much of the AI euphoria of the past decades has seriously cooled off when people began to realize that the sheer computing power needed (regardless of  the base used ) is not the only hurdle to building a "comprehending system" (whatever that may be), let alone the prospect of creating a piece of soft- or hardware with some sort of "conciousness". Unfortunately, there's much more work to be done than just finding the right rules and applying them.

Aah, thanks for explaining them for me.

As far as recent research into AI is concerned, it is my understanding that the concept of a "universal" AI - one that can effectively solve any problem that a biological system can (once again, my definition/understanding may be whack) - has been largely given up in favor of pseudo-AIs that are designed to solve specific problems - like what you explained (a couple of examples would be the autopilot software installed in many commercial and military aircraft, or similar software currently in development for civilian (I think?) land vehicles).

As I said, I'm no expert on the field of AI research. However, I believe you are right. As far as I know, the terms applied to these two different paradigms are "strong AI" and "weak AI".

Of course, there is much philosophical dissent about whether a weak AI should really be called an AI. It all boils down to the problem of defining intelligence and our view of ourselves. At first, it seems unreasonable that a mere (more or less) brute-force problem solver like Deep Blue should be called truly "intelligent", as it just follows a certain programming and reacts to its input in a defined way, but does not "know" what it does. But what would happen if we someday realized that our own thoughts were also the result of a deterministic (biological) programming and that knowledge was just a state of memory? Hilarity would ensue ...

Well, I remain sceptical of our chances to ever answer this question, so we can leave this to the philosophers. Nevertheless, I find many of the theoretical problems that stem from the research field of weak AI to be very interesting and also practically relevant -- like the autopliot software you mentioned, or speech recognition, translation systems and many others.

One thought I've actually had more than once would be the possibility of training a weak AI system to be able to identify unknown file formats. I have no idea how accurate it would be, or how much work it would take, but it's still interesting to think about.

AI isn't a problem because it doesn't really exist yet.. There are scattered forms of a self-thinking program, but they are all reather limited at the moment. as to why you need a base-3 system? you don't really 'need' it per se, but it would make things faster as well as more efficient in the long run. AI will always be a bit limited if you run it in a base-2 environment.

The invention has just begun.. I've got a lot more work to go and the advancements on the standard mathmatical system to the theory that is now present as well as the transistor that makes it all tick is the pavement that will become a long road.

Hopefully, I'll have a computer solving simple word problems by the end of next year.. The complicated proccess that is actually involved there is enough to get myself a reasonable understanding of what needs to happen for a computer to actually 'recognize' something. Fromt here on, the possibilities of file recognition or anything of the like are quite real.


As far as dodging the original question..
This is a base-3 number system inplemented in a 3-state environment like you'd see it in a computer.

2-6-18-81
1-3-9--27
0-0-0--0

What I've got is a little different and as per the term "Base-3" I shouldn't have called it that. I had to do some research myself on the base-3 system to understand what it meant. I'm a bit of a theorist and do tend to forget certain alleys of math and I certainly don't know everything.

Edit: I've got a schematic for the transistory ready to ship off to the patent office as well. Fun stuff, though I'm still rather new to it.

> Hopefully, I'll have a computer solving simple word problems by the end of next year.. The complicated proccess that is actually involved there is enough to get myself a reasonable understanding of what needs to happen for a computer to actually 'recognize' something.

Something that can solve simple word Problems...huh... so basically for a nice start ur gonna re-create SPELL-CHECK.. and using spell check as a basis ur gonna make a pc recognise certain file types..
Why do all that crap which tbh.. ud be going about the long way anyways when windows and Linux and other OS's can already recognise file types..ie: mp3,wav,jpeg,avi,divx ect..

For a computer to recognse something it basically just needs a segment of code thats it can do a search for.. finding a replica of that code or at least a close replica of that code will make the computer try to play a certain file.
Ie: If i delete a bunch of data in an MP3.. but its still called MP3.. then the computer will try and play it still (most likely resulting in failure of course).

Although i dont know as much as some of you seem to.. it appears that your ideas are bigger then ur abilities.
Although thats a good thing ur still trying to invent things that serve very little Purpose or already exist.

of course in 10 years u might release ur TRINARY and itl be a huge hit.. but at the cost of the ENTIRE GLOBE having to delete all their files and computers, MP3S and things everything would have to edited just to work on your system.

Goverments would have to take down their Defence systems and then completely remake them for your trinary.. its safe to say from my POV that the entire world of computers runs off Binary.. so to change to something else would be too much hassle and cost way too much and itd take maybe 100 years for everything to be perfect again..
If u ever do make this work.. then ur best thing is to test a few files off a normal PC and see if they can be viewed,played ect on your system.

That is indeed an interesting idea. To get any meaningful results, however, one would have to do much structural analysis over tons of different file formats. Main problem: You would need to identify some sort of "common structure" to build your system on, though. Still, as you say, an interesting thought.

> as to why you need a base-3 system? you don't really 'need' it per se, but it would make things faster as well as more efficient in the long run.
Well, you would gain a factor of log 2 / log 3 ~= 0.63, by which the ternary representation of a number is shorter than its binary counterpart. But that's just it -- a constant factor, which does not reduce the asymptotical complexity of the algorithms involved.

Because it can solve the given tasks more efficiently than a "one size fits all" approach could? This is an important factor, especially in (but not limited to) embedded systems. "The right tool for the job" applies here as well.

I think the main problem here is that I (as well as all of the others, I guess) cannot see what your "new invention" -- that wipes away the problems encountered during 50 years of theoretical research by some of the most brilliant heads on this planet -- is supposed to be. A simple base change is not the answer, that is probably clear ...

As I said, I was mistaken in the actual meaning of a base- system. This is actually almost more of a logic, but it's a web if you want to call it anything. Able to change dependant on several key factors. The only reason it has any relevance as a base- system is the fact that it needs 3 states to function. I apologize for the confusion as well as my own misunderstanding.

Okay, now that you've brought the transistor back into the game, maybe you could explain in a little more detail how this works? I don't quite seem to understand if you're creating a completely new "device" (by using "raw" materials like Si or GaAs) - in which case the name "schematic" would be misleading or even wrong, or if you're using existing electronic parts to create a new device (for example consisting of 2 PNP transistors, four resistors and 2 capacitors)....?

I think you're simply re-creating either Tri-state electronics (on/off/high impedance) and/or a special case of fuzzy logic ("restricted" in the sense that the transistion function between the states is not linear but a simple step)

But I'm not sure, and you're not telling all the interesting details (because of your patent application I guess)

I'm learning a lot of new terms as I delve into this... For any confusion I apologize..

The transistor: The transistor is based off of a bi-polar transistor, though the final product is quite a bit different. I've considered a modified XOR transistor though the completely recreated Bi-polar transistor was taken in favor because of a theorized cooler operating temperature.

As for the system... I've done some research and it didn't take me long to come to the conclusion that what I have is actually a logic and not a numerical system.. I'm still learning a bit how it will function with modern systems, but it seems pretty well flawless. Soon as I understand more, I'll post about it.

Oh well, you're inventing new terms again:

There is no such thing as an "XOR transistor". This makes no sense, since a transistor switches only voltages or currents, it doesn't do mathematical calculations like XOR. Of course you can build an XOR gate using transistors (in TTL or ECL logic, for example). But then it's not a transistor anymore, it's a circuit which utilizes some transistors.

In what way "completely recreated"? This boils down to the original question: Did you design a new piece of silicon, or do you add some active/passive components to a transistor and look at the whole circuit as some kind of "transistor"...

> Reply from Atrusino

Funny, that's exactly why bi-polar transistors are not used in computers at the moment: They switch currents, not voltage. So for them to work, you need a fairly high current, which would increase the temperature in your chip design.

Come up with something more plausible (or at least something funnier )

Apparently I have a bit more to learn about hardware than I originally realized. Thanks for the input. The XOR bit was handed down by a computer savy friend of mine. I'm takin a break from this project heh. Hopefully after I've finished my degree as well as some perosnal research I'll have a better understanding. Thanks for the input and correcting my mistakes.
