dll is hidden in one of the asset file which is compressed, you can get dll after extract but still not able to edit because of above reasons. There is Assembly-Csharp.dll in managed folder, however its encrypted butI believe all is hidden in MobaLogicAndroidRes.dll.

Screen from managed folder


Thanks Haoose
