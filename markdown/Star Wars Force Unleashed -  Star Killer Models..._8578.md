- Post Title: Star Wars Force Unleashed -  Star Killer Models...

Does anyone have any of the various models w/ textures of Galen - Starkiller.  I know there were earlier posts on different threads but they are all dead and I'm trying to find some.  If anyone can help I'd truly appreciate it!  I have max and blender but I'd love to find out if there are rigged and textured versions... lots of threads and dead info.  I'm trying to find the best that is out there.  Thanks for any help!
