The Skywind mod for Skyrim is coming along really nicely, I'm so pumped for it. [https://www.youtube.com/user/SkywindGame](https://www.youtube.com/user/SkywindGame)

For anyone who doesn't know, Skywind is a from-scratch recreation of Morrowind in Skyrim. It doesn't use any of Morrowind's assets, they're making everything from scratch, and it's going to be fully voice acted.

Yes, I'm following that one. To me, Morrowind is the best RPG I ever played.
