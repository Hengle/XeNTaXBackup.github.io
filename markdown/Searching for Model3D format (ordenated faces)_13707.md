- Post Title: Searching for Model3D format (ordenated faces)

Hi for all, im new in this forum and i don't speak english so i will try to explain to me better than i can.

Im searching for a Model3D that got ordenated faces with vertex similar to this

```
Vertex 2: (XYZ)
Vertex 3: (XYZ)
Vertex 4: (XYZ)
Vertex 5: (XYZ)
Vertex 6: (XYZ)
Face 1: 1/2/3
Face 2: 2/3/4
Face 3: 3/4/5
Face 4: 4/5/6
```


even if it gots (or not) a VN and UV for each vertex can be usefull

```
VN 1
UV 1
Vertex 2: (XYZ)
VN 2
UV 2
Vertex 3: (XYZ)
VN 3
UV 3
Vertex 4: (XYZ)
VN 4
UV 4
Vertex 5: (XYZ)
VN 5
UV 5
Vertex 6: (XYZ)
VN 6
UV 6

Face 1: 1/2/3
Face 2: 2/3/4
Face 3: 3/4/5
Face 4: 4/5/6
```


Again, sorry if i cant explain me properly, the most important thing its that the faces are in order with vertex (123 - 234 - 345 - 456 - 567...

Thanks

Maybe you should look into the Wavefront OBJ format.
