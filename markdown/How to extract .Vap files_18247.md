- Post Title: How to extract .Vap files?

Hi, I am currently working on this unamed mod for rabbids go home,
Under D:\Rabbids go home MOD\Extraction\Rabbids go home RHS
there seems to be .vap files
Does anyone know how to extract .vap files?
I tryed using a very trusty sound extractor called video game sound converter But it didn't work this time! (Log: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xD7 ... sp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xD7TRbLIJ6jjmOUr5SmE6dwvh-lNwchgcUXxzdhzDiI/edit?usp=sharing))
so if anyone knows how to extract a .vap file, That would be very useful,

- .VAP file:
Voice recording file created in Dialogic's VAP file format; contains an indexed, or annotated, collection of .VOX or .WAV files, which use ADPCM (Adaptive Differential Pulse Code Modulation) encoding and specific sampling frequencies.
