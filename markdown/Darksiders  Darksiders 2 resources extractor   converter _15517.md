- Post Title: Darksiders / Darksiders 2 resources extractor  / converter ?

I saw somewhere an extractor app for Darksiders 2, but can't find it any longer.

Basically I am looking for tools to extract models, animations, worlds-maps, textures and sounds/music from Darksiders 1 and 2, and convert them into FBX (models/anims/worlds-maps) , TGA/PNG for textures and WAV for sounds/music.

Are there such tools? If not, is there someone who can create such tool to extract/convert all that?

Thanks beforehand
