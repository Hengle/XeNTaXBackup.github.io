- Post Title: Is this a good way to get a Serial key??

Seing as Im a student at 1st year Animation Degree couse, I LIKE 90% of other students i know am COMPLETELY 100000000000% out of cash.
I thought it might be easier to MOD games with MultiEx instead of making my own aps all the time(this doesnt go far).

I know that im able to ADVERTISE multiex in many places but HOW exactly?
As simple LINK at the bottom of a form maybe?
or do i need an image like this: 

Maybe BOTH.
Because I know that By advertising I am maybe able to get an MultiEx Serial Key.
So i figured im part of about 20 FOrums so why not Advertise at the bottom of EVERY POST, i mean one forum I have over 800 Posts in.
Is that enough or will I need to make my OWN website and post links ect on there.
As my site wont be up for a LONG TIME, not until my game is at least 25% made lol.
If anyone can help me id be very greatful.

I obviously can't speak for Mr.Mouse here (as he is the one who decides who does and doesn't get a key and why), but I'm sure he wouldn't mind you advertising MexCom on the forums you visit, and for that matter, it would probably bring you one step closer to getting a key. If you're looking for some ideas for advertising MexCom IRL, have a look at [this](http://www.xentax.com/?p=108). Any original advertisements are almost guaranteed to score you a key.

Looking good!  Sorry, I was kinda busy, only read your post today!

I think you've earned your code, if I may just still suggest you use the below banner as signature there (see my sig : get it here: [http://www.xentax.com/pics/multiex.gif](http://www.xentax.com/pics/multiex.gif) ), or the new MexCom logo (see attachment)

Yeah, the MEX logo, or the animated GIF banner, that's up to you  

Would be really cool if you'd write MexScripts

Nope, it's by Canadian friend Stephen Cameron AKA Kamshaft of [http://www.mxvsatvcentral.com](http://www.mxvsatvcentral.com) and [http://www.camerongraphics.com/](http://www.camerongraphics.com/) . 

He did a fine job! !
