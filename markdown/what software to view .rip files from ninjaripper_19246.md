- Post Title: what software to view .rip files from ninjaripper?

I just extracted some 3d model files with ninja ripper

the files are in .rip format

last time I remember I did use a small software that can load all the 3d model .rip file at once and I can see the whole 3D model at once

I cannot remember the name of this software

please let me know what 3D software I can use to view all the .rip files all at once to view the complete 3D model ?

Thank You

along with ninjaripper you have the 3dmax importer and the noesis script. Also you can find the blender plugin, just google it.

With the noesis script,  I have to import and export each individual file 1 by 1

I found a Maya ninja ripper import script but I keep getting errors when I try to run the script in the maya script editor

does any one know how to get this maya import script to work?

Please see below url

can I import multiple 3D object with the 3D studio max importer scripts?

Of coursed you can, here you go: [EvoGIMS](http://gims.openiv.com/downloads/GIMS/EvoGIMS_webinstall.rar)
It will look like this:

 I suggest you a modified 3dmax ninja ripper script, you can find it in the tool folder when you downloaded ninja,is called "ninja_importerb7_cl69.ms", EVO Suite is good, also supports bones, but with many files imported together, is very slow

Actually no. You can batch export them, and it makes your life 10 times easier.
Go to "Tools" in the upper left corner of Noesis, then select "Batch Process", then specify the folder and the extension from which you want to convert and the extension you want the files converted to!

In conclusion, Noesis is the best for previewing and exporting .rip files.
