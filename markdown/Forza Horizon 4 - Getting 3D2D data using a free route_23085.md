Hello, I want to get models from the PC version of Forza Horizon 4. I searched everywhere but all they just say is 3DSimED. The program is 40 bucks! Is there a free alternative? I want to get textures too! And how do I access the files for the game? I changed the permissions for the game, but it's telling me I have to get permission from myself to access cars. Huh? I am myself!

You can use the Registry Trash Keys Finder 3.9.4 utility. Works with 3DSimED31s.

Beware, the textures for the cars for FH4 are a nightmare to work with, I myself had trouble finding a lot of interior textures and perhaps I'm looking in the wrong place, but only solid colors are easy to deal with, stuff like leather stitching or badges and gauges etc. are difficult for me to find or not at all usually. If anyone could explain in a simpler fashion how this stuff works that'd be nice.
