Yeah this isn't my thing for figuring out a packing format. I'm sure someone around here can help you out. I'm interested in the sounds from this game as well.

Is there any known way. I've been searching for a while on this, and got a few files extracted from some Loco Roco thing but its not quite right at all.

Sorry for the double post I just would like someone as well to try to look into this. Its odd I thought sgb format was in one of the Bleach Heat The Soul series games and people got the soundtrack of that converted.

Edit: Never mind I just used VLC Media Player and got them extracted that way. One huge audio file that needs splitting but thats fine for me. It works thats all that matters to me anyways.
