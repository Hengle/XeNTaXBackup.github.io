1. It would be nice to fix that pesky login thing. I am viewing this page and want to make a comment so I log on. After logging on it says return to the index page....I instead want to return to the page I was viewing and clicking back only takes me back to the index.... It would be nice to have a button where it says return to the previous page. I know it can be implemented because I have seen it before.

2. I believe understanding file formats is a great thing. There's not many tutorials on it. That sort of thing intrigues me. I have seen some of those bms scripts I think it was where it basically goes into a file and magic happens and game file appear.
It would be great to understand what is truly going on.

3. At it's core Xentax is about programming. So any teaching of that kind or making applications of that nature would be beneficial to the next generation.

4. Also when posting a comment the "Nofity me when a reply is posted" should be on by default.

it always annoyed me that the xentax banner seems to redownload everytime i visit a new thread.

have it cached/lower the resolution or remove whatever timestamp is causing it to do that please!


also, whatever happened to xentax changing hands?

Changing hands? Like new leadership? It didn't. Yet. Still.

I need help extracting .wpc files. For some reason, Darksiders 2 has all their character sounds in these wpc files which from what I've read is an obscure word processor format. I just want Despair's horse sounds, which are nowhere to be found in the core.pck or en.pck, but I suspect they're in the SFX_Character_Despair.wpc.

This forum thread is NOT for discussion of game requests, check the rest of the forum for a place to ask this.
