- Post Title: Bioshock 2 DLC (Minerva's Den) - How to find all DLC texts

Hello, I would like to translate the DLC but I have a problem finding the English texts. I know that English texts from DLC are not included in the Localizedint.lbf file. So I unpacked French and English and compared everything so I know what files and lines are missing. I have a list of files in red from which I can not find the texts.



I know that the Gui file is the entire content of BioShock 2 Remastered\ContentBaked\pc\FlashMovies
I know that the Manual_perobjectconfig and Quests_perobjectconfig are in unpacked ConfigINI.IBF file.
I know that the ShockGame file is from unpacked .u file ShockGame. (there are all subtitles)

I extracted all the .u files and tried to search them, unsuccessfully. I used HxD to search. Maybe someone can help me?
