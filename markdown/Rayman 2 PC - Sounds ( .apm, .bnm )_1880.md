Good news. bnm files Ã¤r just PCM files, and it would be hysterically easy to make a converter for them.

apm files = ADPCM audio. should be possible to make a converter there
also, but trickier.

BNM files: I see... but how? I can't just rename them to wav and play them...

APM files: Well, I can't make any converter...
