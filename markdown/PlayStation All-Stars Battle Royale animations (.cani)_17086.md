- Post Title: PlayStation All-Stars Battle Royale animations? (*.cani)

Is there any info on how to open or use PSASBR's animations? They're in *.cani, which seems to not be understood yet.

It should be noted that both the PS3 and Vita versions of PlayStation All-Stars Battle Royale use *.cani, and I'm pretty sure other games do to. I think in general it's used for Vita games.
