- Post Title: Problem with BloodRayne 2

I've used MultiEx to open a few games files up now, it's not a problem but the BloodRayne 2 (full game) doesn't seem to want to work for me.  I get the process error:  ID strinf of formal invalid, MEX could not process archive 5.


I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong since I'm trying to access the files like the other games I've successfully accessed using this program. I tried to do a search too, but too many threads that didn't seem to answer this exact question. I'm new to this site so I apologize ahead of time for posting this if it was a problem. I just am unsure why I can't access these .pod files, but other games on the list work fine. So if anyone can help, I'd appreciate any reply. Thanks.

not sure what that error is though.
But for the time being you can use this[http://www.turfster.be/](http://www.turfster.be/) persons BLOODRAYNE tool to do it.
I have never used it so dont ask me how lol.
You really should have checked the topic of this name u know.
There is a topic specifically for bloodrayne tools lol.
Though i do wonder what the multi ex error is lol.

I saw the topic, I think those tools failed for me like it came up with a message saying it didn't recognize them as BR2 files.  So I'm confused and this program seems to be the best of the bunch I tried. other than with this specific game.

Indeed, the error means the archive is invalid.
