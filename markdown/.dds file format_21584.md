- Post Title: .dds file format

Hello,

I am in search of a program that I can save the following format of .dds file, can anyone help me with this? I have not been able to find anything that will do it yet. The format is as follows:

Format 32 bits (float): 11 bits red, 11 bits green, 10 bits blue, Linear color space with ALPHA CHANNEL

TIA

ehh... this format? shouldn't work as you want. this 32 bits will never be able to hold floating point format and the r11g11b10f has no alpha channel. the closer possible formats are

32 bit - r10g10b10a2 (known as hi10 surface) integer with 4 possible alpha values, or...
64 bit - r16fg16b16a16f which is floating point at half precision and alpha channel.

maybe another higher rgb bit count is the DXGI_FORMAT_R9G9B9E5_SHAREDEXP format at 32 bits. i dunno if this would work as alpha hack tho.

DXGI_FORMAT_R11G11B10_FLOAT actually exists and there is some use for it, according to this [twitter thread](https://twitter.com/BartWronsk/status/848412750795612161)

Yes it does and the game Farming Simulator 19 is utilizing it. They are using this format of .dds to control the shape of 3d rubber tracks with color spectrum. I can open the file and edit it with paint.net but I can not save the file in the correct format for the game engine to recognize. That is why I am searching for a way to save it correctly.

you can use texconv to convert to R11G11B10_FLOAT   
[https://github.com/Microsoft/DirectXTex/wiki/Texconv](https://github.com/Microsoft/DirectXTex/wiki/Texconv)

```
texconv -f R11G11B10_FLOAT -px conv_ your.dds
```

Thank you Acewell, I have downloaded the program but for some reason it can not get the program to open, it pops up for a split second and then closes immediately, any idea's? Tried running as an administrator and in compatibility mode

texconv is a command-line tool, you must run it from command prompt.

Acewell after further reading last night I did figure that much out, I tried running it as a command prompt line and kept getting an error. Do you know of any video tutorials on how to do this, I tried searching for one with no luck, I can post the error it was giving me later tonight
