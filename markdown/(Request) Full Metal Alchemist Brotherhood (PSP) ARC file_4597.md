.arc is a fairly common name for an archive... also there are a few archive files that use the same format...

I forgot what I was getting at with that... but I'm pretty confident that there are already tools for it.

Tried searching for ' .arc extractor ' already?

the compressed data starts at 0x2B
and ends at 0x7A4B7
the zsize is 0x7A48C
the size is 0xD7108
i would try aluigi's bat file with these settings to find the compression.

Hi valvoga:

I´ve just made an arc decompressor for this game and seems to work for every .arc file in FMA: Brotherhood.
If you still interested, I´ll upload it
