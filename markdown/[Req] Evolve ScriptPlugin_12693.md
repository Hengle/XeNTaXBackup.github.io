- Post Title: [Req] Evolve Script/Plugin

Hello,
i'd like to know if there's someone around here with the right skill 
to make it possible to load up meshes in 3DSMax or Blender.
I can't tell much about the differences to the other Cryengine mesh formats,
so here's a sample if anyone's interested. (One static and one skinned) 
Cheers!

Those models will not work with Noesis and CryTek plugin. This is newer version of CryTek engine - I will pick this one, if no one will be interested or working on this game already. Does anyone?

EDIT: Need more samples, more skinned meshes (not much interested in static ones, though they should be supported too) - game is too huge to download.

Those models imported fine, lol I thought you will upload more models   I can't release script without testing, I need at least 10 different models of enemies/npc/player, so I can tell, that script will work correct with this game
