- Post Title: Family Guy: Back to the Multiverse (take two)

Continued from [this thread](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=9910).

It has been a while, but I think it's time we got back to the subject. You see, I recently bought the game and I might want to rip models from the .ho files with the tool EcheloCross developed. At the moment, [tMR](http://models-resource.com) lacks models ripped from the game, including those for Brian and Stewie.

Unh, I don't want to sound rude, but why isn't anyone replying to this thread?

First of all, you should reply to the original topic and not create this one.

And also not everyone are interested in modding this game and not everyone have knowledge and capabilities to do that. I'm also waiting for some modding tools, but it takes time and effort to make those.
