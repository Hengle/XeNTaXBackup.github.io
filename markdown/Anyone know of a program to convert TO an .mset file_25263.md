- Post Title: Anyone know of a program to convert TO an .mset file?

So I finally managed to actually extract some ships from Star Trek Online, and editted the new Odyssey mission pod onto a different Odyssey, but I can't find a program that converts an OBJ file back into an MSET file. Anyone know of a program to do that?
