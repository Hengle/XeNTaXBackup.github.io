There are not any tutorials about that. :p

The only way is to see sources of the other people and learn from it. Many source code packs are available here on forum or on github. Just search for it, you can start here [viewforum.php?f=32](http://forum.xentax.com/viewforum.php?f=32).

I'm curious as well, I don't see people posting programming tuts about these sort of things. Only guides I see are generic on how to handle integers, binary and text data.

Hi, i started with this awesome dude : [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ORnfYn ... eL4fBI1Z7k](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ORnfYnlXOw&list=PLgeoiwC2u6R6NIX_-AIsd62eL4fBI1Z7k)

He have a nice video tutorials series about reading a binary 3D mesh file with maxscript on 3ds max, it's a good starting point i guess.
Also i've also this lack of "ressources" problem, you need to read a lot about how actually you can make binary files in C++, how to parse files etc...
How you store Vertex buffer inside a file and many stuffs related to creating game assets etc.

Hope it can help !
