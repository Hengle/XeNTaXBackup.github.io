- Post Title: Patch file not found in the arc file...?

Hi,
I've updated the british bulldog texture since the ingame m odel was just... orange and mat (color, normals and trans), I reinject them fine in the pac file but when it's time to update the arc files, Xpacker tells me that one of the patch file (entrance attire) is not found in the arc file....?

Anyone?

Go through some of the tuts on my website, it explains how to add additional attires, etc.
