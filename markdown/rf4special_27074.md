This mesh format is rather simple. It would be very easy for you to check it yourself using hex2obj or similar programs.

BRRESViewer won't work because it's not a Wii model format, BFRES is for Wii U and Switch games (in this case, the latter). Use Switch Toolbox to open up and convert the model and textures included in said file.
