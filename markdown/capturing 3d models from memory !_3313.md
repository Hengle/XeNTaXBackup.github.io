- Post Title: capturing 3d models from memory !

With 3DVIA Printscreen you can save in 3D XML and easily share 3D models coming from any application based on several rendering APIs. OpenGL is natively supported. 3DVIA Printscreen also supports Direct3D 8 and Direct3D 9 rendering APIs starting from version 2.0. 3DVIA Printscreen 2.3 is compatible with the last version of the 3D XML Player (see the Tutorial section of this guide for more information).

3DVIA Printscreen is the equivalent of Print Screen but for the 3D world. 3DVIA Printscreen is based on the 3D XML technology allowing you to directly visualize the model in the 3D XML Player (available for download here). Please note that it is strongly advised to update your 3D XML Player before using 3DVIA Printscreen 2.3

yes i know all about 3dmax plugin and i know that each 3dxml is made of two txt files
but i need a stand alone software that can batch convert 3dxml files to 3ds because i am going to use 3dprint screen for games that not have mod tools . i work with maya . thank dear friend for your attention $

I send an email for V71 and this is his response :
------------------------------------------------------
I didn't think you were still interested i am working on a model loader / optimizer , the tool is written around 
an engine i am working on since quite a bit of time , now , and i am starting to collect informations around
the 3dxml format.
It took so long because i had to write a lot of algorithm for mesh optimization.
i attach a file for you to watch.
