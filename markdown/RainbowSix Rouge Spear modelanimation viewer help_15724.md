- Post Title: RainbowSix Rouge Spear model/animation viewer help

I conducted research on how to view these files, someone had made a model/animation viewer with animation injector.

He said that its a CRP+SKL/DAM viewer created with a Sandbox D3D application(I have no idea what this means). I wanted to try and export the files myself using a program like quickbms; however, the .DAM files are the actual animation files so there is no point in using it. Also, he never released his application for personal use; or a source code. I want to create a program that enables the user to do the same thing but I dont know where to start.
