- Post Title: HLSL & Textures extract from games

HELLO!

I'm looking for a tool to extract the HLSL shaders (High Level Shader Language) of the games ( for learning and understanding )   
It would also be nice to be able to pull out all the textures from the scene (visible RGB colors, transparency , specular maps , and so on )   
If there is a universal method - generally healthy , but also tools for the analysis of game archives - very interesting , because I do not always want to pass the entire game   
Recently I saw a ninja ripper tool , before he apparently was DX-ripper, but HLSL files , he could not even pull out of the current scene. Maybe I just did not know how to use it.   

Thanks for any tips .
