- Post Title: Sacrifice music

Hello everybody,

I'm trying to extract the dialogs, sound effects etc. from the game Sacrifice, but at the moment I'm having some trouble. I managed to open the .WAD files of the game and to extract them, but those files don't have an extension name (like .wav or whatever). Since there is a ton of files, I was wondering if you know a quick way of finding the extension name of the files. I read another old topic with a similar problem, and they used a converter to fix this, but the converter is no longer avaible :/

Thanks a lot
