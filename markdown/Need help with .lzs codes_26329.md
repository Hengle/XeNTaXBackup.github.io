- Post Title: Need help with .lzs codes

So I recently found .lzs files in this game called Story of Seasons: A Wonderful Life. There's an English patch but the text keeps cutting so I thought editing the code in lzs files would be helpful. Any clues on how to open the code in them? There are a lot of programs that extract the models but not the code so I thought I'd ask here.

I have attached some files I'd like to be decoded.
