Has anyone managed to port over any sound effect files from Halo 3: ODST? I'd really like to get a look at them.

If not but we have the xma files, I have a script that will do the job.

I'm confused. What exactly are you asking for?

I'd like to know if anyone has the sound files from Halo 3 ODST. If so, I'd like them.
