You can try to modify 7401 (5D 12 00 00 ) to 3809 (E1 0E 00 00) from offsets 85 to 88 using hex editor and see if UnrealEd can open it.

Batman uses a custom package container it will not be able to open it.

Another idea is rebuild file structure, correcting pointers and offsets, with extracted content and modify compression flag to "none".

I didnt make this, nor do i take credit, but this tool i found a while back works on almost every unreal engine game I've tried, including batman umap and upk files.

Looking for that tune that plays on batman as it switches scenes? When the badman symbol spins across the screen at the switch of the scenes on the old batman shows. I want just that sound, and I can't seem to find it anywhere. Anyone have any suggestions?

i'm not sure if this can help you, but gildor made a package decompressor. you can pick it up here: [http://www.gildor.org/downloads](http://www.gildor.org/downloads)
there is also a thread in his forum about translating this game: [http://www.gildor.org/smf/index.php/topic,272.0.html](http://www.gildor.org/smf/index.php/topic,272.0.html)

hope it helps

I apologise if this has already been answered above I'm trying extract the: music, speech, and sfx from the B:AA demo. I've been able to get the files down to .Packages and SoundNodes but I'm unsure both what to do next, (as all the .ogg extractors including Jaeder Naub I have tried have either failed or been virus filled) and whether or not I'll be getting all the audio files I want. Any help welcome.
