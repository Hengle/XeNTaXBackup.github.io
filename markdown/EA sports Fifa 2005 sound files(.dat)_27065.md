- Post Title: EA sports Fifa 2005 sound files(.dat)

Hello friends, I am trying to export and edit commentary files from fifa 2005. It was bigf(.big) files but I exported them to .dat files almost 4,000 files. I tried many ways to open them or play them via sound player but I failed the sound seems destroyed or it has more files inside that I must export them before, probably!
Can someone help?
-Thanks in advance!
