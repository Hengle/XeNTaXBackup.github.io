- Post Title: The Last Express (PC) (1997)

Hi all, I have a copy of the game in a folder on my desktop. I do not have admin privileges to install it, but I manage to work around that with alot of my games via a no cd crack reading from the folder I have the files in. I wish to do the same with The Last Express. I can not install the game, but I have all the files to run it in my folder, and when I start the.exe for the game, it wont run. Is there a way to install or play this game without admin privileges?

oh it's simple, nowhere on xentax.com because there is no section of the forum about these things.
anyway if in you I would have tried selecting the compatibility option on the executable to Windows 98

Actually there is.  [viewtopic.php?f=10&t=2395](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=2395)

And obviously I tried, the computability, which has nothing to do with my post. Its an ADMIN work around problem.

We do not deal in warez. Do you own the game? I can imagine that the game (1997) is too old to run. Look elsewhere to find cracks, because we do not deal in cracks. If you need help on how to run it without, post something in the Holy Cow forum, that's the off topic forum. But do not ask for warez.

That topic fits in this section, "Game Archive Research". You should have read that post.

I OWN the game, the problem is the admin privileges on my computer. I need to work around them. I wasn't aware cracks were warez, as I use them for most of my games to avoid CD swapping.

Of course crackz are warez. Do you ever see a company release a crack for their game and ship it along with the DVD/CD? Don't play stupid.

Pssshhhh, they dont lose money if I buy there product and use a no cd crack. There is no way you can say that i'm using warez because I have a crack, you and I both know that. Its simply the face that I own the product, I can manipulate it anyway I please within the copyright laws, and I dont see cracks being covered there as its not the game.

Back to the matter, I still cant run it because of admin problems.
