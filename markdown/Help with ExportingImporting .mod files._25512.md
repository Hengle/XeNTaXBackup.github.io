- Post Title: Help with Exporting/Importing *.mod files.

Hello, I've searched and saw some similar posts here about modeling for *.mod, *.anm files import to applications such as 3DsMax, blender, etc.
I'm wondering if someone can help me with getting these files able to import/export to any program successfully.
I'm willing to pay someone to help too.
in previous posts I found an importer that works for 3DsMax for the .mod files using FatImporter, but found no way to export them when finished editing.
- game name is Corum Online - 
here is a link to some of the files: [https://download1654.mediafire.com/bqz4 ... ff/490.rar](https://download1654.mediafire.com/bqz408rn1vng/9dnj323jn499eff/490.rar)
just a basic monster with .mod and .anm files.

Please help me. If anyone knows someone who can get it done for a cost I will pay to get this done asap.
