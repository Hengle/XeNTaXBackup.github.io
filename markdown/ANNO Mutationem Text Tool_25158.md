- Post Title: ANNO: Mutationem Text Tool

Hello, I think this is the language file of this game. However, the file appears to be encrypted and does not enter the game when we make changes.
If you keep the number of characters the same, there is no problem, but when you exceed the number, it stays on the loading screen.
Can we solve this?
Game made with Unity engine.

Your sample is SQLite Database file [http://wiki.xentax.com/index.php/SQLite ... se_SQLITE3](http://wiki.xentax.com/index.php/SQLite_Database_SQLITE3)

It can be opened and edited with SQLiteStudio (it's not encrypted) [https://sqlitestudio.pl/](https://sqlitestudio.pl/)
