- Post Title: Diablo 4 Datamining

Wanted to throw this in here to see if I can find someone that would be up for helping datamine upcoming Diablo 4 files for website/application output. 

If anyone is interested in getting involved and has some Diablo 3 file extraction/interpretation experience drop me a PM.

Thanks guys!
