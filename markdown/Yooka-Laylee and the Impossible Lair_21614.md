Hi,
I need some help from a programmer able to make a small extract/insert tool for the strings in this file [https://1drv.ms/u/s!ApMUGr0cuN39gcYTQjg ... g?e=VghW2W](https://1drv.ms/u/s!ApMUGr0cuN39gcYTQjgXQLwaNLFTfg?e=VghW2W) 
The problem is that the strings must be null-byte $00 aligned to the next double-word starting with the offset-byte for the next string:

I tested this format and translated the strings at the beginning of the game into Italian, and it works:

... but now I need some help, since translating it using a mere hex-editor is too slow and annoying.

Here is it. This should help other translators with this game:
