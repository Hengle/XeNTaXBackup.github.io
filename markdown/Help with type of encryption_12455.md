- Post Title: Help with type of encryption

Hey,

yet again, an encryption-related question. Any ideas which encryption these files could be using?
The *.dec files obviously are the decrypted equivalent to the others. Only thing I noticed is that the first four bytes are the same for both.
Maybe that's a hint?

Thank you very much!
