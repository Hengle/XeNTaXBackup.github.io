- Post Title: The Crew MF .TOC/.BFD files

Hello,
I got my hands on the GUI files from The Crew Motorfest Insider Program, however i don't seem to find a way to extract the files like with the .dat/.fat format.
I do believe however that the method is the exact same and it could be unpacked similarly like with the Crew 2 unpacker that I've been using.

Could i ask for your help to extract whats inside the files?

I am not a modder or programmer, but i would really like to take a peak into the files.

Thank you so much for the help in advance!
