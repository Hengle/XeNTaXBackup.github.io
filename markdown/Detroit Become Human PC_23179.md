- Post Title: Detroit: Become Human PC

Hi everyone, someone shared a tool,
to extract videos about Detroit: Become Human
So I tested it and extracted videos on the PC version,
I recently encountered problems with the videos Already the videos are in BINK format
Some videos work well but others don't work at all. I would like to know if anyone can help me make the videos work, the video is green
It would be really nice to get some help to make them work

here are the links and a picture of the problem
