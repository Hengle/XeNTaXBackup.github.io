- Post Title: SXWad Compiler

First and foremost I would like to thank MrMouse for his extensive work and everything he's done. Because of his research, I have done further research in the SXWad files from Counter-Strike XBox. I can now create SXWads from scratch, alter files, change placeholders, change compression, change display names, filepaths, add/remove files from an SXWad, and much more. The picture below is a pre-build of my SXWad compiler for all CSX Modders.



And again, thanks again MrMouse!

Thanks! That looks GOOD.  

Will you add your tool and details to the Game Specific Tools section at the WIKI?

Would be great!
