Where does it repack the coalesced.ini file? It looks like it does something and it says DONE! after a very very little waiting, but I don't get the repacked file.

Just repack with the same folder, don't change the folder to MK9Game.

Is there a way to unpack the Coalesced.ini and .fra and .eng from the game Injustice Gods Among Us?
I've tried with your MK9_Tools but it doesn't work for this.
Here is a zip file which contains Coalesced.ini Coalesced.eng and Coalesced.fra.
Maybe you could find a way to unpack them?
