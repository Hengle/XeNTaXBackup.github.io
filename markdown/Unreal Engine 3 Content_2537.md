- Post Title: Unreal Engine 3 Content??

Hey everybody,

I was just wondering if i could get some assistance getting into some content from Gears of War....

I managed to get m hands on the bink videos, but where is the rest....

i found some unreal engine file (xxx) .... how do i extract whats inside them so that i can potentially get my hands on maps.... models .... textures music and so on.....

this is my first time trying to rip open console games and i have no idea where to start???

can anyone help/....?
