so after the lackluster content... and figuring out than 3.5GB from the 5.88GB are just multilenguaje audio files.
i hope someone begins to extract this cool character models.  im looking specially for metal gear files but since most of the stuff uses the same encoding everyone might get their uncharted/god of war characters too, to be ported to source filmaker/ garry's mod smash bros, whatever  i only want raiden's armor to make a life size pepakura of it.

so here there are some of the files i presume  character mesh-texture-victory/super attack theme are encoded... pls halps!
expect 3 different mesh for each character and 3-4 different (color swaps) textures for each one

on the escenary u can expect a metal gear robot with some flowers and bees... and a city block.

I've been told that this game is not really extractable by now, because it uses encrypted packages

Did Anybody of you try to use psarc extractor? The packages uses zlib compression so you might take a look at this tool. 
You should able to find some informations about this format on this forum and on the web. There should be a quickbms script here, a tool , offzip and a plugin for total commander on the web.
