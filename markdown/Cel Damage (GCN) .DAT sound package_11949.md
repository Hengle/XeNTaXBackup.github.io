- Post Title: Cel Damage (GCN) .DAT sound package

Posting it in here instead, because this seems like the more appropriate board to post it in.

In the game Cel Damage, the file "TalkToMe.dat" contains all of the voice clips used in-game. This game has some really funny voice clips, and I'd love to rip all of them. Unfortunately, I can't figure out how to do so. The closest I've gotten is opening the pack in Audacity as Raw Data, then adjusting the speed and pitch in order to get it to more or less the original speed and pitch of the clips. However, a loud humming sound obscures all of them, and you can barely even hear the voices.

Could anyone please help me with ripping the clips correctly, such as making an extractor or something?

Thanks in advance.

Sorry for the double-post, but I screwed around with reducing/removing the noise using a different program, and I feel I'm getting SOMEwhere... This time, the voices sound noticeably louder than the noise, but the noise is still very prominent.

If anyone would like to take a look, then please let me know and I'll send you my current results via a PM.
