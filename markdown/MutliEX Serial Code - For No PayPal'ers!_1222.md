Well, PayPal is free though, and also works with bank accounts.   

But other support is also welcome, naturally...

I have a PayPal account that I opened awhile ago, but it's always had a balance of $0 USD!  I also have a bank account, but I'm only 16, so I can't link it to my PayPal...

Xentax should offer another way to the no Paypalers. If some are no Paypalers, that means they are not adult and their parents doesn't have any credit card. I know some of them in the community where I am (MXvsATV).
You should give a bank account datas... 

Name...
Bank Account Number...
Swift code (IBAN)...
...

It seems Paypal accept payements from bank accounts BUT NOT IN ALL THE COUNTRIES ! Here, in Belgium by example, I can't send money through Paypal without a credit card. I did it with my Visa card but some of my friends from Russia, Sweden, ... can't do it. For some of them, having a credit card stay a priviledge !

Than every no Paypaler will donate by bank wire.
That will keep more time than Paypal (1 week ?) but you will have more interested people for the MultiEx Commander. Maybe you'll must ask +/- 8$ by bank wire (taxes, I dunno).

Peace and thanks for all what you do.

Phil.

I agree, we should offer additional methods. 

So that's what we'll do.
