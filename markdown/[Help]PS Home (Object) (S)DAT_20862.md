- Post Title: [Help?]PS Home (Object) (S)DAT

Hello ...
I have recently acquired the Playstation Home "Last Day" dump from archive(dot)org.
and have decrypted some sample object SDAT files.
and i looked at them and realized i am way out of my depth.   
so if anyone who knows what they are doing has some free time could you please take a look?
