Crysis 2 Demo has an archive called nigel in mpdemo/ dir. So far it looks like this one is unencrypted, just smartasspacked. Anyone succeed on unpacking and, possibly, packing back?

Whilst opening the nisomething in winrar; it returns an error "Unexpected read end of archive" something.

Maybe they altered something...

i took a look at the file and i don't have a clue. there's a lot of zip local file ("PK\3\4") headers, but they are very improper considering that fields like sizes and checksum are just zero. the file name fields are also improper too, since all of them are folders rather than files.

then again, this might just be my lack of knowledge of the zip format.

It worked fine thank you,
but could you write a script to repack it ?
So we could use the config files,
modifiy the cvars for better graphics
or try to add more maps to the demo ?
Please, this would be great.

well I explain the situation also here so anyone else interested can read it.

from version 0.4.9 quickbms has the -r option that allows to reimport the modified files back in the archives (yeah!) but this feature works only with the scripts and the archives that allow it.

in crysis2.bms I have used the external dll for the decryption job so the reimporter can't call it and the reimported file will be not encrypted (and so will not work).

there is also the fact that crysystem.dll doesn't have an Encrypt function and so I should write the encryption function by hand.

I will valuate if it's ok to add the algorithm to quickbms natively for doing the job on the fly using the -r option

good news, within some hours I will release a fixed version of quickbms for doing the reimporting job.
the problem was simply caused by the xxtea algorithm implemented in the tool that didn't performed the swapping of the data and a bug in the key.
with this new version will be also no longer needed the crysystem dll.

new version out of both quickbms and the script:
[http://aluigi.org/papers.htm#quickbms](http://aluigi.org/papers.htm#quickbms)
[http://aluigi.org/papers/bms/crysis2.bms](http://aluigi.org/papers/bms/crysis2.bms)

anyway note that I have not tested it with this specific game because I don't have space and time to waste with the almost 2gb of nigel but keep in mind that there are big chances that the new nigel with the reimports will not work because it's a zip file and so it contains also the crc of the files (unchanged and so invalid).

so if you want to try read the section 3 of quickbms.txt carefully but in any case I CANNOT help on this thing.

Thank you Aluigi,
could you help me to repack the whole thing ?
I´m not sure how to do it, because I get an error with Cmd:

```
C:\Users\DC\Desktop\quickbms\ER.bms
C:\Users\DC\Desktop\quickbms\Nigel
C:\Users\DC\Desktop\quickbms\InputFolder
```

"Error: unsupported compression in rebuild mode"

What do I wrong ?

Edit:
Ok, finally I had success repacking something 
I´m able to manipulate the multiplayer.cfg,
so I added "g_skipIntro = 1" and the long
intro videos are gone. but I couldn´t
find a spot, where "r_displayInfo = 1"
has any effect...
I also tried to enable god-mode,
but then I get the error that this
can´t be set to 1 in the release version xD

the compression message is a bug in quickbms, I'm fixing it.
I will release the new version tomorrow because I want also to find a way to compress the zlib and deflate data more.

oh I was forgetting: avoid to use quickbms64_test, it's only for special cases because it's working is not guarantee

That would be cool for example, we can´t change files with a different
size in the moment, which makes the whole thing less usefull.

It would be awesome to use some tricks to modify the
file sizes inside the the Nigel file but I don´t expect anything
because of this:

> Now some important notes about this particular reimporting process:
- you CANNOT increase the size of the files you want to reimport, so
  the new files must be minor or equal than the originals
- for the maximum compatibility within the thousands of available file
  formats I have decided to not use tricks for modifying the original
  size and compressed_size values (think to those formats that use
  encrypted information tables or the scripts that use MEMORY_FILEs
  for such tables or that use things like "math SIZE *= 0x800")

I have just released the new version with the fix

for the size there is nothing to do, it must be minor/equal than the original.
this is physical limitation of any reimporter because for modifying the size is necessary to break the whole structure which means writing a custom rebuilder for any file format... absolutely out of mind.

For anyone who is interested, here is what I was able to manipulate
in the Crysis 2 Multiplayer demo so far...

Through repacking the "multiplayer.cfg":
- g_skipIntro = 1
- cl_crouchToggle = 0
- cl_zoomToggle = 0
- *there is much more that can be activated or changed*

Through repacking Music/Language sounds:
- I disabled the annoying "Nano Vsion Activated" voice (Yeah, it was so annoying !) 
- *There are tons of sounds you can disable or exchange*

I'm trying to modify the textures of the multiplayer models but the only thing that happens when I reimport them is that the game refuses to read them at all. 
Why is this?
Any ideas/suggestions?

@Xerious
Crysis behavier with the repacked files is strange...
For example I put "g_skipIntro = 1", "cl_crouchToggle = 0" and "cl_zoomToggle = 0"
into the multiplayer.cfg and it works fine.
But as soon as I put "r_displayinfo = 1" into the cfg,
the game still starts but all changes have no effect anymore,
also the displayinfo don´t show up....
So I wonder, how can Crysis know which things I have changed ?,
because I don´t believe Crysis disables the whole multiplayer.cfg  (?)

Xerious how do you change them and whats the goal of it ?
I mean all things you repack have to be the exact size of the file
you want to replace, isn´t this difficult to manage with these textures ?
also, could you give a more detailed description about your problem ???

@Aluigi
I have a strange problem with your programm:
I want to change a ".xml" and replace it,
so I extracted the Nigel, took the file and modified it.
Then I repacked it, but when I start the game,
I only see the background but the login screen disappeard.
Ok, at this point it could be normal because of an incompatibility.

So I made a test,
I took a fresh (not modefied) Nigel and extracted its content.
I took the original ".xml" and repacked it into the Nigel.
I started Crysis and the same problem happens,
only background no loginscreen shows up.

For me it seems like the tool isn´t working properly (?)
Because it shouldn´t have any effect on the game
if you replace the original files with the original files  
Any explanation ?

The reason to why I'm changing the textures is a bit hard to explain but I can assure you that it's not in cheating purpouses.
Well, I'm opening the DDS files in photoshop and editing the skin texture by simply painting dark green over it. Then I save the file as DDS again, the problem is I don't really know which type of DDS file I should save it as. I can, for example, choose between saving it as RGB or ARGB (and many others) but I'm not familiar enough with the DDS format to know which one the game is using. The file size is actually not affected by the edit so that's not a problem. However, to test if the file format was the problem I reimported the original files again and the game still didn't read them.

- Post Title: Re: [PC] Crysis 2 BETA

problem found.
the explanation is located in the encryption algorithm that is a block cipher.

in short a block cipher doesn't work on single bytes but it works on sequences of bytes like 8 bytes each time.

now if the original compressed size of the file in the archive was 0x123 then the game will decrypt 0x120 bytes and will decompress 0x123 bytes.

if our file was compressed better than the original like 0x11f bytes then the game will do the same as before, so decrypting 0x120 bytes and decompressing 0x123 (because we have only reimported the file, not changed its zsize/size values).

obviously this leads to the corruption of the final bytes of the compressed data because it should decrypt 0x118 bytes and not 0x120 otherwise the remaining 7 bytes that are in plain-text will be decrypted and so corrupted.

well, all this technical explanation is the cause of the problem, hope at least someone has appreciated it :)

anyway don't worry the fix in quickbms occupies only some lines so I will release it in the next hours in case I remember something else to change.

thanx for the feedback, through this crysis 2 I'm making the new reimporting function of quickbms really error-proof ih ih ih :)

shoot the idea, I'm all ears.

anyway remember that quickbms has the universality in mind (it's a "generic" tool, not a specific one) so it must work with the majority of archives as much as it can and any modification must stay in this rule

Forget the question, I wanted to aks you if you could try
to make it possible to extract the ".pak" files from the
Crysis 2 full version... but I see, you already updated
QBMS and the script and it works nice, thank you again 
--------------------------------------------------------
Now for the Idea,
as I was repacking the "nigel" file from the demo,
so often, I recognised that when you reimport
files it takes pretty long...

Normal behavior:
QBMS looks inside the file you want to import
the data in. Then it searches for all files
and dirs wich are in the file and then
it compares the files on by one with
the files you want to reimport.
If the file/dir of the e.g. nigel
is the same like the file you want to reimport
then it reimports it. Then it goes over to
the next file an so on....
For example you reimport *nothing*,
QBMS goes threw all dirs/subdirs/files
wich are in the nigel and compares them with the empty folder.
This takes ~30-50sec, for doing nothing.
I dont want to know how long this would take if your
file would be more then a few gigabytes...

So, wouldn´t it be smarter to switch the procedure ?

Better behavior (probably xD):
QBMS first looks inside the folder
with the files I want to reimport,
it remembers the files/dirs.
After that it looks inside e.g.
the "nigel" and compares
the remembered files/dirs
with the files in the nigel.
After that it reimports the files
that match to the nigel´s files.

This way it would require a few secs only...

----------------------------------------------
SORRY FOR THE BAD ENGLISH,
in the moment I don´t feel like spending much time for proper English...
----------------------------------------------------------------------
I hope you got the Idea, if there is anything unclear, tell me and
I write it again...understandable

the lack of speed is caused by the fact that it visualizes all the files and not only those to import, for example if you iconize quickbms during the reimport operation it will take 1/10 of the speed.

because the "read the filename and check if the file exist in the folder" operation takes almost no time.

don't worry this is something I'm gonna fix in the next version, after all it's a simple "if" instruction to add :)

QuickBMS defenetely wastes too much time for visualizating the files i don´t want to import 

> don't worry this is something I'm gonna fix in the next version, after all it's a simple "if" instruction to add
Ok, I´ll see then. Just thought I had to inform you about the bad speed...

I can't reimport files, quickbms can't find them and says in the end that nothing has been imported without giving any error message. 

What am I doing wrong?

possible causes:
- you are not using the original archive
- the folder you selected is empty or doesn't have the files used in the archive you selected

Well, I select the original "Textures.pak" as the archive and then I have a folder named "Textures" with only the things I have changed in it (in their appropriate folder of course). However, quickbms just searches through the folder and doesn't stop when it searches in the place where my edited files are. When the import is complete it just says that nothing has been reimported.

Another thing: I can't get the GUI to work for reimporting files. I create a .bat file containing "quickbms.exe -r -w" and put it in the quickbms folder, but when I try to execute it cmd shows on the screen for about 0,5 seconds and then closes immediately.

for the .bat it was an error of mine that I corrected some posts above, you must create a link to quickbms.exe adding that -r -w options in the "Target" field of the link.

for the rest I don't see problems, do the link as I said and use it via the GUI and it will work since it's for sure the usual problem with the current directory and command-line tools

I got the GUI to work, thanks 

Now, this is weird. I extracted the files from textures.pak, then I immediately tried to reimport the files again but it still said that no files have been reimported. How can this be possible? Is there something I'm missing?

EDIT: Figured out what was wrong. I thought you were supposed to choose the texture folder as output folder directory if you were trying to reimport to the texture.pak file. I tested and found out that you were supposed to choose the folder containing the texture folder. Confusing 
But thanks for the help anyways!
