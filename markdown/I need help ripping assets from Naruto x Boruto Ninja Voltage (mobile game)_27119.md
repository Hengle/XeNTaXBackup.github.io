- Post Title: I need help ripping assets from Naruto x Boruto Ninja Voltage (mobile game)

Hello, I have managed to get the game files and uploaded to AssetStudio to view them, and I found Texture2Ds and Sprites but some of the assets are missing.

For an example, there are literally no audio/voice files at all.

Then, I noticed AssetStudio doesnt recognize the assets inside a folder called "ondemand" and there are about 2k assets there and I think they are encrypted/compressed.

Here is one of the examples of the encrypted assets:
[https://files.catbox.moe/e7wyy8](https://files.catbox.moe/e7wyy8)

Is there a way to decrypt/decompress this type of file? I think those are the remaining assets. If anyone can help me I would really apprecaite it.
