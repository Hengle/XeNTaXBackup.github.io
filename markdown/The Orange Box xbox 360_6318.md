In the tf folder under there is a zip0.360 file. I know how to extract but I need to know how to recompile with it being the same size. I tried using winzip but the file was 15 megabytes less than actual size. I did edit one file in the zip after extracting but it should only add an extra 2 kilobytes. What can I do?

Are you sure it only needs to be the same size? Usually there's some crc or checksum of the file that is going to be changed if you alter any byte, regardless of size.

so what your saying is the whole disc won't work after modifying. I do stealth patch it before I burn it but does this game even have those kind of checks?
