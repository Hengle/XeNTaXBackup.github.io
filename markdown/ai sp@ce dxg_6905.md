- Post Title: ai sp@ce dxg

Here are some ai sp@ce documentation I found from a japanese bbs.
I saw images of the viewer, but I can't get it to work myself (cause I don't have the client anymore).

On the other hand, the format is documented, but I can't follow the code cause there are several different cases and it's commented in japanese lol

ai sp@ce has shut down as of june 30, 2011, and the client is no longer available.
There are a couple circulating on chinese upload sites. I have the last two update bundles (manually put together by someone else), but the last one hasn't been decrypted.

EDIT: the dxg format is in the "memo" folder.

Client files + all updates.
Note: 12 parts, 500 MB each.

Note2: 6.68 GB are pure sounds and animations. Meaning, 6.68 GB of stuff you don't need and can't use anyways. You'd probably be better off just working with the patches.
