im looking for a way to import more models into a game (Tales of Pirates/Pirate King), its extension is .lgo.

so i need someone that know maxscript and 3d formats to make a tool that import and export .lgo format,
already exist a similar tool but only import you can study its code.

The import thingie has been done by Mariusz Szkaradek123, iirc.
The export to .lgo is a shitload of work and from my experience it's very unlikely that someone will take up this task.

There's a possibility to modifiy existing static models but it would require a detailed format analysis that means all sections must be identified, especially the header.

Yeah, from .lgo to .obj is quite simple, the problem come when we need to convert .obj to .lgo, i know someone that finished this tool completely and its fully working from the A-Z like @wolfen https://www.youtube.com/user/Wolfendev/videos there will be a lot of videos regarding importing/exporting models, modelling models, texturing it etc (.lab .lmo .lxo .lgo .obj etc etc...), im not sure if him modified the existing static models, but as i see in the videos i see .lgo as default format

Hi Jenny,
this is a research forum where people generally don't work for cash.

Does someone in your team have coding experiences?

If so I'd suggest to have a look at this thread where ofkings linked to a PKO Modelviewer in C#.
(You could add debug/logging lines to the code so that you simply would get an overview of the pko format.)
[viewtopic.php?f=16&t=17502&p=140133&hilit=pko#p140133](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=17502&p=140133&hilit=pko#p140133)

There's a screenshot in my post as of Sat Apr 28, 2018 8:28 pm

Hello guys, sry for revive post, but now the src of the game  is public, and have the code of the lgo, we have a max script, but it's too old and don't open in 3d max, so if someone that understand about it, and fatduckimporter have some of the code to import. Lgo, just don't export it.

Lgo, just don't export it.From what I understand neither the Visual Studio source code, nor the scripts contain exporter code, right?

So your news doesn't change anything - you're still required to understand the lgo format, for example from the C# code you already showed (see my previous post which you ignored obviously) BEFORE you can start writing an exporter.

I don't have the time to do it - isn't there anyone in your "crew" with some basic coding skills?

idk if is leaked or legal ahahha someone from pkodev bought from a chinese guy.

Well idk if it have the exporter code, coz i dont understand this part, and cant use the tool, it wont run in max 2009 and a cant get to run a older version in my pc 

i did little "export" search in files and come this result:


idk maybe this "exp" means export



two team have this tool, but they dont make it public (of course   )

lwExportSkinMesh() sounds very promissing.
