- Post Title: Rebuild .hogg files for Star Trek Online?

Using the tool found in this [thread](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=4020&hilit=champions+online) I am able to extract .hogg files.  Does anybody know of a way to rebuild the .hogg file or is there an source of information about the .hogg file format?

You don't need to, STO and CO both have an override content directory ("localdata").

Do you know the format for using localdata for a hogg within a hogg?  For a specific example from CO:

I'd like to modify the images of the maps to include points of interest.

bins\bin\geobin\maps\Missions\CAN\Can_Dead_Alive_Instance\Can_Dead_Alive_Instance.Zone\map_snap.hogg 

contains the images for this map in Wtex files and this .hogg is in bins.hogg.  So I don't know what I would put in the local data and under what directory structure.  I've randomly tried some possibilities but they haven't worked.

As an aside, thanks for the original extraction tool, I wouldn't have been able to get anywhere without your previous work.

Oh, for hogg-in-hogg, I have not looked at that and I doubt they have a system for that, sorry.
