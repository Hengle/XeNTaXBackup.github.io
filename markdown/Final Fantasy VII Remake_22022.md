I've been asking on DeviantArt about this, but apparently, the models from the final game can't be extracted until a PC port or a passcode of 32 numbers is found. Any idea on what does that mean?

That's correct, but this person named Yare-Yare-Dong on deviantart has apparently managed to decrypt the full game already and is making renders with character models that weren't in the demo data such as Aerith, Tifa, Roche, etc.

Unfortunately they don't seem to be interested in sharing their methods -- aside from apparently lending some models out to their friends (e.g. that Tifa Butterfinger render that blew up on Twitter, the same dA person seems to be friends with them).

Jesus, you're right:





Aerith and Tifa files wasn't on the demo, so he or someone else managed to extract the models fully rigged from the Full Game. That means that there must be a method to get them extracted, probably it hasn't been tried yet. Gonna take the risk and see if I discover how did he extract all that stuff, but I don't think I get replied back since you're saying he and his friends don't see interested in share the models or their methods.

Yeah, I have no idea how they got into the full game - everyone else kept saying it would take forever to compute the key.
Hopefully someone else will figure it out too and will be less selfish.

I remember with FFXV models it took forever for the method to become public, after the same handful of people in the exclusive 'club' were making renders for a long time. This time though we might fare better, since more people seem interested in getting the models compared to that game.

Yeah, I remember that people had to wait a while for FFXV models, but I didn't expect it happened the same stuff is happening right now. Which it doesn't make sense tho, why don't just explain the methods they used to extract the models so everyone else can? Eventually we will all know, so it's a waste of time to have the "exclusive club of people", like you say. Hopefully this time we have to wait less time, I ported almost every model from the Demo to XPS and I was hoping to get to work with the final game eventually.

Oh I realize now, I think I ported your extracted models from the Demo to XPS, that was a nice job indeed. I was gonna ask you too on DA if you heard any news about all this, but I wanted to ask directly here on Xentax just to be more sure about the subject. I don't have the files from the main game either, maybe soon enough we can get them eventually.

Thank you very much yes I hope I will not wait too long to get them I looked everywhere No file He replied saying stop spam when I only sent one message We can talk directly on deviantart To see how to do it I will still try to see with his friends When I saw the rendering of the models I told myself that it is impossible I sent him a message directly he did not want to say how to do

I already told Crazy31139 about this stuff, perhaps he can investigate a little more and try to discover how did they do it.

Another person named Sreliata made a render with models from the full game (Aerith and Zack).

Someone asked them on twitter about how they ripped them and they replied "I got them out myself, there is no ports for them anywhere. That is all I can tell you right now; I hope you understand."

So far she didn't reply back yet. Expect the worst scenario, I think we will have to wait for the PC port.

I think she's just ignoring me at this point. I guess all hope is lost until April 2021 (That's if we get an actual PC port tho).

WELL, she finally replied back, and as you can guess, I didn't had good news.

Basically they all did it by themselfs but refuse to explain how, or who teached them to do. I Hope there's some dark stuff behind it because then I don't understand why they are all so "top secret" about all this. Which is nonsense, since once everyone can export models from the game, their 5 minutes of fame will be done.

I just gone to Gildor just in case (maybe they find out a way to extract the stuff), and there's a Guy who believes I'm joking or something (Even when I posted proof about it, you know, the renders and such).

Of course you are telling the truth that you have shown the photos of the models well Look at the people extracting the models
people on DeviantArt check out another model I'm sure there is a way to check out the file by not accepting the update When you have to install the game and enter the computer

With FTP have direct access to pkg

on the web page when you hack your PS4
First you have to do it, you have to click on FTP or you have the PS4 hack, then you download the application on the computer

it gives you the address on the PS4

there you enter the FTP Server application and there you have access to the PS4

I think they did it like that

Extracting things from FFVII Remake would be the same as what was done for the demo version so that part won't be an issue for you. Of course the problem would be getting the files, for a while now there is a PS4 scene that has jailbroken the most recent of firmware's and they share the files in secret amongst each other. A lot of the actual file formats on PS4 are a lot easier to deal with than older generation consoles and I imagine some time into PS5's lifespan the PS4 jailbreak method will be made public. Right now they are most likely at fear of Sony patching it if they release it.

There will never be a Jailbreak

I don't understand why he doesn't want to help daemon1 He was the only one to decrypt Detroit
Did he have a PS4 hack with the right firmware no

So everything is possible

If I had had the PKG I would have given it to everyone I would not have been selfish Like the others who believe themselves to be superior

There is a secret jailbreak, you're not understanding what I'm saying. Working with a games files (converting models etc) is not the same as decrypting a PS4 PKG, they are two separate processes. People are able to decrypt PS4 files because they have a secret jailbreak method which works on the more recent firmware, they then pass these files onto people they trust. As FFVII just uses Unreal Engine the existing UE Tools will work on the decrypted files.

I understand what you are saying but what I am saying we will have nothing new on our PS4 console The jailbreak is 5.05 or 5.07 The only one who has the jailbreak is the hackers Unless a person is not selfish and sharing files

And the chances of having the files are very small

I will try to find a way for the files I will not wait until April 2021 to have it on PC

Unless someone makes it compatible with the SDK on 5.05 like the demo

but I do not believe it

Right. But my point is don't be mad at those that have created the jailbreak it's understandable why they wouldn't want to release the method (because Sony would just patch it if they knew how it worked). I can see your point about the person posting pictures of the model, especially considering they probably didn't do any real work themselves to extract them, but don't be mad at the ones that devised the jailbreak.

All of this implying that they used the Jailbreak method tho. They could've used another method, but we will never know tho.

So, more news: I know the reason behind all this stuff being private.

I won't dig on it too much because it looks like they want to keep it as private as possible until the game has been released for some time (I guess a month or so), but, basically, it's for Square Enix. Apparently they got pissed off real bad with the leaked demo models and they banned some people, so after figuring out a way to extract the models from the final game, they don't want to take the risk to do too many renders (or saying how did they extract the models) in case Square finds them and attacks them with Copyright and such.

Why tf can't they just give us the PKG key though? It's just a string of characters to gain entry into the full game and has nothing to do with the ruination of their 'golden egg' -- unless I'm looking at this the wrong way.

The firmware exploit takes the game and copies off the content unencrypted, but can't you also gleam the encryption key to gain access to the real package's contents (but not run on CFW)?

I don't know man, probably they don't want to lose their stuff, but apparently there's another reason. One of them told me that people like ProGamer will make profit from it or use it for degenerate stuff (Apparently ProGamer uses to port children models or something like that). Which is not the first time I heard something like that about him, but I didn't expect him to be one of the reasons behind them being secret about it too, so...

What the hell, @ProGamer.

Everyone extracts child models, I'm not the first And that's not it, they don't want to share files

I have no right to do what I want? I never share child models

People on DeviantArt have child models why it always falls on me

It's not my fault that the files are not shared

Who told you that, it's not my damn fault if you didn't have the files

MrUncleBingo

What the hell, @ProGamer.

I don't understand why you mark this everyone has the right to extract what they want It would be nice to attack other people who extract child models Instead of taking it out on me and saying that this is my fault

Sounds to me like the person who extracted the files is a fucking dick bag and is only in it for profit. Also, what the hell does child models have to deal with this? It sounds like you guys are just going at each other because you cant find a solution to get the models yourselves.

Yeah, I really doubt that's the reason. These people are disgusting tbh - they want to feel special and be lavished with attention for being 'so smart and amazing' for making these shoddy renders, meanwhile they just happen to know the right people.

You guys should stay alert, but try to not let it bother you too much - surely someone else will figure it out eventually, or someone in their secret society will squeal.

they want to keep it as private as possible until the game has been released for some time (I guess a month or so), but, basically, it's for Square Enix.
Sorry man, but they are just bullshitting you. They don't give a fuck about SE, and they haven't "figured out" anything. The tools/scripts for that game are available since the demo came out. They just know someone with the private exploit who can get the game files.

Sounds to me like the person who extracted the files is a fucking dick bag and is only in it for profit. Also, what the hell does child models have to deal with this? It sounds like you guys are just going at each other because you cant find a solution to get the models yourselves.

Which is why I created this thread, to know if there's a way to get the models ourselfs (Instead of asking everywhere if X people can share with us X models).

In any case, I do not know how long we will wait to have the files And I think that it is a private exploit That does not prevent them from extracting all the models and putting them on DeviantArt I think that there will have a lot of models on DeviantArt that will not be available for download Let’s take the example
Yare-Yare-Dong

he extracted a our model

Do you think they are afraid of Square Enix It even has renderings on Twitter These people think they are smarter and superior to others It's just to make people jealous

If you don't ask people do you think the files will fall from the sky
It's a waste of time, nobody is going to share the game files They will keep them for And extract the models

Yeah, I really doubt that's the reason. These people are disgusting tbh - they want to feel special and be lavished with attention for being 'so smart and amazing' for making these shoddy renders, meanwhile they just happen to know the right people.

You guys should stay alert, but try to not let it bother you too much - surely someone else will figure it out eventually, or someone in their secret society will squeal.

The fact is that eventually there will be a way to extract the models. It could be tomorrow, the next week or the next month, but eventually it will happen, like always does. I'm not bothered tho, I'm just trying to stay as neutral as possible (It doesn't help me at all to throw myself into A or B, I'm just guiding myself for what I'm knowing for now).

At this point, they will not share them. I didn't expect them to share the models at least, I just want to know a way to extract them myself (And other too) so I don't have to go asking other people for certain models when they probably will never share them.

I don't know anymore man, this is frustrating as fuck. I kind of have an idea of who that possible exploit can be but I can't say too much yet because I'm not 100% sure about the subject.

MrUncleBingo

And where I did not understand what you said, I extract child models As I said above, everyone extracts child models on DeviantArt it is not because of this if the people don't share files And at least I don't share child models
and i don't do weird stuff like some people

and as said
askB This has nothing to do with child models They don't want to share files I feel like it's my fault if you don't have the files

you said that
What the hell, @ProGamer. As if it was my fault

Why do you care that much? I also extracted child models from some games (Coco from Crash Bandicoot, Kid Bruce from Telltale's Batman, Gohan from DBZ, I don't know, I ported too many stuff to recolect). I just got told that, that apparently you would make profit from it and/or that you're interested on the child models of the game (Kid Tifa I guess, for instance). At least that's one of the motives they don't want to share the method too (Besides the Square Enix stuff, but we don't know if they're serious with that or not too).

And who told you that? It's not just me who's interested in a child model Everyone extracts child models and that doesn't mean anything I'm sorry but you shouldn't put everyone in the same bag

In any case, we are not going to get mad at each other for that. It's not the subject

Yeah, we still will have to wait for some long time for a tool or something to come out tho.

There are tools to extract the models I myself was the first to extract the demo with Umodel I managed to extract the models and especially the texture
There are even scripts for Blender It works with the full game

I have script myself

I even tried to ask the person again for the files but never answer me it's a waste of time I stopped asking him

If you have a PS4 hack you can do it with the FTP server You install the game in the console you ignore the update And you can have access to the pack It will ask you to connect You have direct access to the console on the 'computer

I tried on Detroit a long time ago

Let me see if I understand right: You had the tools the whole time (Which can be used for the full game too, on Blender, with scripts and such).

How do you know that they work with the full game if you don't have the files from it? (Since you kept asking them for the files but they didn't share them with you).

Because I myself extracted the demo with the files and the script   

So I know very well that it works

And for information I do not stop asking the files but it was for me and for you  

But I stopped asking because nobody answers me

And I always kept the script for the full game

I like the photo if I had the game files I would have released all the models And I would have put them to download

And yes the scripts work perfectly with the full game and the demo For Umodel you must first extract Because it is not compatible but it works

I even extracted all the PAKs with a script

The people who have the files do the same

Do you want me to share links

I have a script called io_import_FF7R To import demo models and full game models into Blender  

If you want to have the links so much, here are the links yes it works perfectly I may not have the game files just the demo But I know very well that it works

And for information someone asked me And it's strange because for him it worked

Im defending you, moron.

How do you want me to find the pkg key if I don't have a PS4 hack I only extracted the demo but not the full game

If only people could give us the files

Could someone tell him to share the files with us? Someone said she was very nice This shows that she is very nice xd She is not at all friendly She is proud because she has the files But refuses to answer to share with us

Watch this person on DeviantArt

Yare-Yare-Dong

he would have the game files, i think it's just to brag. Certainly, there is a lot of rendering with the models, we have no evidence. It may be the same model, but it is not the same color as the clothes I say that but I say nothing but I am always lost

I was told that the game was on firmware 7.02

There was a new update with the
firmware 7.50

I'm absolutely sure they don't have access to the file and the template but I could be wrong

I asked on Twitter the people who did the jailbreak They replied that nobody asked them
Only hackers have access to the private jailbreak

firmware 7.02 This is marked on the PS4 jailbreak site

And one last thing that a person who worked on the jailbreak in private answered me that he would not be ready to put the jailbreak in public Even when the PS5 comes out then do not dream

There is just a private feat
