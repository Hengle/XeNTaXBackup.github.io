- Post Title: Help me find how to translate Ace Combat 7 please

Hello everyone,

I'm new to the translating scene, and I have a lot to assimilate. One of the project I'd love to make is translating Ace Combat in my native language.
I tried to find where to find are the text files, tried to unpack the .pak file . Maybe I'm not on the good road for this but I'm trying to find it. It's hard to know how to go to your goal when you have little idea where to go.

Will someone help me figure out finding how where are the texts, how to extract them, etc... I have little knowledge, but I'm willing to learn and really determinated.

Thanks for reading me !

Ace Combat 7 was made on Unreal Engine 4, so you can use these tools to unpack PAK archive

As for text searching, you can read this tutorial first [https://ikskoks.pl/searching-text-strin ... commander/](https://ikskoks.pl/searching-text-strings-using-total-commander/)

I've already linked a tutorial about finding texts in games. Just read it carefully.
If you won't find anything, then texts are probably compressed or encrypted and require more investigation.

You can try in hex editor like Hex Workshop.
And if you'll attach some samples, maybe someone will be able to tell you more.

Hello, I'm translating an old game and I don't know what engine it was made on, but the game is Legend: Hand of God. Its text files are hidden from me, they are probably inside .PAK files and I can't find them no program to extract these files, could you help me with any tips or indications? Thank you very much for your attention!

> but the game is Legend: Hand of God
You should create a new topic for this game and you should upload PAK samples, if you need help.

This topic is for Ace Combat 7 and you mustn't ask off-topic questions here.
