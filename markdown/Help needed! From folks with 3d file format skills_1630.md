Anyone tried the Fate models! its 100% sure they are original modeled in 3dsmax.. The models a gorgeous lowpoly.. and would love to be able to mod this game..

For a shareware game this rocks! Everyone who loved diablo 1 would love this! It is however abit combined with diablo 2 and other rpg games.

my 2cents...but sometime when you ask the author itself it can help you to mod the game.

almost no chance for a big company but in shareware game is a bit luck.

anyway...try it for free
