- Post Title: The Fractured But Whole; File ripping (SDFDATA + .MMB + .VAP)

Hello! I've been scouring the forums here pertaining to UBISOFT/snowdrop games involving SDFDATA. I'm trying to get the audio files and possibly some character models from The Fractured But Whole game, but with little to no luck. I've currently found and utilized the applications "offzip", "quickbms" (and the extra python thingy for MMB files), "noesis" and I could not figure out how to use "rouge_sdf". I understand that these weren't necessarily designed for TFBW game and rather The Division however it was noted that they are of similar format and could possibly work if the python script were edited.

When I used offzip I was left with files like these (this is where the VAP in the title comes from, they're mostly DAT files though.)

When attempting to open these files in several file viewers however, many of them were just hex codes (idk what this is) or were 'broken'. Specifically the VAP files (I'm under the impression these include voice files) were 'corrupt' when I tried to open them. I've redone the offzip method twice now, I'm not very knowledgeable in how it works however so it is possible I've done it wrong and I would appreciate some feedback on this area.

When I used quickbms with the extra .MMB The Division python thing, I ended up with files like this.

For this group of files, I used the noesis application to attempt to view the .MMB file, however it would not open and I got an error saying there was a missing integer. Reading the forum where someone else tried this on TFBW, it was said that the file is missing the version number I'm pretty sure and that the script would need edited?

There is a reddit forum where one guy ripped the music from the game and he mentioned using the same program he used on The Stick of Truth game, however he did not mention what the program is and I'm having trouble finding it. I'm under the impression this is possible however I lack the skills and time to be able to do this project. Any and all help would be appreciated as I've been stumped for a while now. I'm mostly interested in the .VAP files as I wanted the voice files originally, the model files were just what I stumbled upon first.

Also wanted to note I could not figure out how to use NinjaRipper (was mentioned in another forum about this topic). I will be attaching a .VAP sample, a .DAT sample, and the CAMELDATA+EDITORDATA+MMB files. I apologize if the way I send files is of inconvenience to you. If you need other samples please let me know and I will do my best to source them. Thank you for taking the time to read this.

Mediafire link leading to the samples, it is 1.92 MB in size as it includes both samples however most of the size comes from the CAMELDATA+EDITORDATA+MMB files. I apologize in advance if this is too large for the forum and will remove it if necessary.
