- Post Title: The Secret Saturdays - Beasts of the 5th Sun (Drew Saturday)

Hi, this is my first post here on Xentax. 
I'm trying to rip a female character, Drew Saturday, from the game The Secret Saturdays - Beasts of the 5th Sun.
Model featured here: [https://streamable.com/k2rtx](https://streamable.com/k2rtx)

According to Wikipedia, the game is available on: Nintendo DS, PlayStation 2, PlayStation Portable and Nintendo Wii. 
I'm not sure which platform is the easiest to rip models from, but I decided to experiment with the Wii version from romulation.

The game runs perfectly in Dolphin Emulator. 
I tried to follow this video tutorial on how to rip the models from its ISO file: 
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCpN5V6M4DM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCpN5V6M4DM)

Using WiiScrubber 1.4 to examine the ISO, I noticed my files are a bit different from the tutorials: 
[https://streamable.com/2hh2m](https://streamable.com/2hh2m)

Where exactly do I find the files that contain the character models, or is there more decompression needed to be done? 
This is my first time attempting to rip a model from a game, so if I am going about this all wrong, let me know.

The only place I see arc files are in homebuttons.



-Edit- Update

Here is the updated mesh for those who want to play with her (no rig/skeleton yet):

I decided to give Ninja Ripper a try, but now the pieces need to be put together along with applying the textures:

Texture 1:


Texture 2:


If someone wants to put her together, I have her file here:
[https://my.mixtape.moe/mkameq.zip](https://my.mixtape.moe/mkameq.zip)

The zip file contains a blend file, textures, readme.txt and a zip file containing all the mesh files.

I'm trying to do another rip with Forced interval to 15, but getting similar results. Maybe NinjaRipper doesn't play well with this particular game. 
Will switching to another wrapper make a difference? It is currently on D3D11 Wrapper for Dolphin v5.0 64bit. 
I'm using the Beasts of the 5th Sun Wii iso from romulation_net, which runs perfectly in Dolphin.

I'm new to this, so hopefully someone can give me some insight on how to get a clean rip.
Maybe someone can take a gander at the Wii ISO. If the Wii version doesn't work out, I will have to try the PlayStation2 or PSP version, or I can try my best to work with the rip meshes and manually paint.

Also, if anyone is good at reading the ninjaripper logs, let me know. The log is around 2MB file size.

*Update Progress*

SFMLab community member, gimmeaname, managed to get her this far:

```
https://sfmlab.com/forum/forum/model-requests-5/topic/drew-saturday-the-secret-saturdays-nsfw-1118/
```

Now I can just adjust 1 side of her non-T-Posed meshes and mirror it

SFMLab community member, gimmeaname, managed to get her this far:dunno, which script he uses and which rips.

From the rips you've uploaded I tried Mesh_0027.rip with this script:

```
'''Last Update: 27.01.2013'''
'''Version: 1.18'''
```
 and the uvs look pretty unusable:

that's exactly what i saw. and i used the same version of the plugin. just apply the texture and it works. just remove doubles and you see the plain uv islands. yours are still upside down tho.

Here is the updated mesh in case anyone wanted: [https://my.mixtape.moe/uyqykl.zip](https://my.mixtape.moe/uyqykl.zip)
I've been busy following weight painting guides, so it may take awhile before the next rig update.

I'm experimenting with rigging multiple Objects/Meshes to 1 Armature. 
Besides joining all the meshes into 1 object and then rigging, is there another way to fix the open seams while keeping the objects/meshes separate, or is the only way is to rig the whole single mesh and then separate after?

Multiple Objects to 1 Armature Demonstration: 
[https://streamable.com/1cehf](https://streamable.com/1cehf)

I've seen some amazing character models with multiple bodygroups for clothing, hair etc, but I'm curious to know what the workflow is like to rig all those separate meshes/bodygroups to 1 armature. 

I understand that some mesh parts can be simple as rigging to a single bone, but what if the mesh/object needs to interact with more than 1 bone?

-EDIT- Solution
Solution from JawSFM from SFMLab:

> Joining everything, rigging, then separating is really the easiest way to go about that. If you're worried about finding the right seams again, you can assign the parts separate meaterials and later use material select to separate.
