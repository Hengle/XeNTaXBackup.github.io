- Post Title: [FE10] Fire Emblem Radiant Dawn Model conversion help (.gs, g)

Hey guys, I'm actually relatively new to modding and hacking, but I decided to look into modding FE10 (Radiant Dawn) to see what was possible. I wanted to change a couple of characters' classes (like Oscar to Falcon Knight), but I found that that would require some model editing if I didn't want to resort to them using the generic class model.

I managed to extract the models and textures using a few tools like these [plugins for Noesis](https://github.com/Zheneq/Noesis-Plugins) and a few of the tools I found [here](https://feuniverse.us/t/radiant-dawn-fe10gamedata-tools/8117/7). Thankfully with these tools, I was able to convert them into a workable format (like .fbx) and edit them a bit in Blender.

However, unfortunately I can't seem to find a way to convert them back into the game's .gs format. If there's anybody familiar with these files, would anybody be willing to help me find a way to convert the file format into the game's format ?

Thanks in advance !
