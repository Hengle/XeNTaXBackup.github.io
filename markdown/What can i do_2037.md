Spread the word about MultiEx Commander, search for game news sites and give us a good number of email addresses to contact them for our press releases, stuff like that.

no clue! ive been looking for a tool like this forever, but never once did this site pop up for modding game files.till i searched for "CAM files" the playboy thread popped up (on like page 15 in a google).plus i know tons of guys online, and not one of them heard of this tool! so i figured must be keeping a low profile

cheers!

Hehe. Well, I suppose there are a lot people in the world and it's not easy to reach them all, especially if you are a non-profit organisation such as the Xentax Foundation, and do without advertising. We do have press releases and a number of big game sites do pick it up, as well as the odd game hard copy magazine, but I guess we rely heavily on mouth-to-mouth propaganda. If we have a low profile, it's not because we want to  Helping people mod their favourite games so they can enjoy it even more (in a legal way) is our prime goal when it comes to the MultiEx project.

That is an unusual idea, but it might be a start. I''m not telling you to do anything though, just making a few suggestions. If you can show an original way how you advertise the website, that might earn you a code!


As a general remark, in this time of digital cameras, it might be an idea to make this a sort of new feature of the site : who can think of the coolest way to advertise MultiEx Commander or the website, and make a cool and perhaps even funny snapshot of it. All authors of which ideas/methods/pictures are selected for publication at our frontpage will ear a code. Something like that?

I cna get MULTI EX this way?
Wow i think i MIGHT try it.
THo tbh the reason that you  SHOULD keep a LOW profile is because:
1): Were all Modding Games with Copyrights (As in were not legally ALOWED to edit or do anytihng)

2): Some of the games here are BIG, ie: King Kong, PS2 games, Metal Gear Solid Espescially, some companies if they EVER were to discover this site MIGHT decide to close it down or EVER try and SUE people, they will go to ANY lenghs to protect whats theirs, they have the money to back them up.

3): MORE publicity will INCREASE the constant spamming by IDIOTS, ie advertising PORN sites and such.

4):lol I havent Quite gotten to this one yet, but im sure theres another reason.

I am only stating a few reasons, obviously you knwo these, but im just advising on how any of us members should go about ADVERTISING, like for example DONT advertise this site on say "The Konami Buliten boards", tho i think thats MORE then OBVIOUS lol.

There is no law that prohibits discussing ideas. In the US, where our server is based, there can be no copyrights on an idea. The structure of game resource archives can be defined as an idea, a concept. Then there's the Fair Use policy. The Fair Use policy implies that owners of software have the right to explore their legally bought software and even discuss it with others, as long as it is 'fair use' , in effect intended to educate, or to enhance lastability of the product. What is not accepted is commercial activity.  

Let me get a couple of things straight, we do not accept messing with copyrights, we do not accept warez, we do not accept illegal distribution of games, we do not accept discussing ways to crack software so it can be freely distributed, we do not accept modding games to cheat, we do not accept modding of games for commercial use unless you have asked permission from the company that has the copyrights. We are discussing file formats, we are not condoning illegal activities in any way. 

If I want to add a little flavor to my legally bought copy of CC Generals, by changing the look of a few units, adding funny sounds etc, nobody is going to care. If you bring out a mod and sell it, the company has every right to ask you to stop doing it. Personally, I donÂ´t think a company has something to fear when a few people mod their game, in many ways it enhances the userÂ´s experience and therefore lastability. The way an archive is structured is very very difficult to claim, the contents is not difficult to claim. In mods however, one could argue that the contents of a file has merely changed. Nothing is done to the original file, only the structure of the file format it used so a file is compatible with the games source code.  

We are a foundation, and rely on donations. Every friend of the project that volunteers to help out or donate some money gets a gift from us, a key to make full use of MultiEx Commander, as we expect it may improve their means of supporting us. We do not sell these keys, nor is there any kind of guarantee that the program will work, and there is no obligation what ever that we should support the program. This is specifically stated in the End User License that every user of MultiEx Commander has agreed to. They also agree not to use the program for illegal conduct.

WeÂ´ve had popular magazines writing pages on MultiEx Commander. Then it can hardly be illegal, now can it.

In addition, anything that can be done with those features unlocked by a MultiEx key can be done manually, it's just often harder or more tedious to do so.
