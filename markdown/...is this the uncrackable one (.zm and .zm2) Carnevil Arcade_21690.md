- Post Title: ...is this the uncrackable one?? (.zm and .zm2) Carnevil Arcade

.....the problem is:
I can't even get to the files :-/

Carnevils +/-1500 files are split into:
- .wms   =   textures (already figured out?)
- .za      =   model-format
- .za2    =   model-format
- .bnk    =   bink-video (all of the games backgrounds and stageassets are pre-rendered fmvs)

I'm able to convert the games .CHD file into its original .RAW hard drive file via chdman (comes with mame).
From there on I can make out a couple of the games characters names and all filetype names via a hexeditor
The game itself is able to run a filesystem check.....so does this help to locate the single files within the raw?

So before we can check out whats going on with the games models, we first gotta get the single files.....does anybody have experience with .RAW hard drive files?

ColourBlindZebra over at [http://greelyvalley.weebly.com/](http://greelyvalley.weebly.com/) had success with the textures already! Sadly he doesn't respond when contacted.
Here are a few samples:


So to any of you who are powerful enough to help me on this, I kindly ask to have a look 
I don't really know of any cracked arcade games....it would be SICK to see somebody here succeed!!!

RAW is just a file extension. 
I've run across so many files with that extension is't not even funny!
As an example? Silent Hunter 5 uses files named *.RAW
Those are height maps that I have written a script to convert to an obj file for editing in a 3d program.
Then wrote a script to convert back to the SH5 RAW.
The Gr2 format was supposed to be uncrackable. 
That didn't work out so well.

I know.
but .chd is also just a file extension to unify mame roms.
However I here got the carnevil .chd file with chdman and the batch-command that converts the .chd back into a 3.5 gig RAW-Imagefile.

Yeah, it is super old, right?
It's an arcade game by midway.
I found this article about the games making of:

The .raw file is just a raw image of the contents of the hard disk from the game. Unless you know what filesystem its using and can find a tool to unpack that filesystem there is no real way to get at the files.

I'm not real sure about that.
I've found some real interesting areas I want to look at closer.
Being it was an old Arcade Game? Not much was ever done to encrypt files or code.
Also you need to think of the time period and what formats were there that could be coded in C as that was the big thing back then.
Also. Given it was run on a simple Arcade machine? They would not have as much power as even your computer has right now!
Do NOT let the extension RAW distract you! Any file extension is just a name.
Most RAW file extensions mean nothing!

Hell yeah! I love to hear that somebody is interested in digging a little deeper into the games files.
I just love it!

I found this info about the games hardware:



The games 3d Artist talks a little background in the article i shared with you a couple days ago:

> "He set the tone for the game," says Pikulski. From Hambone's humble beginnings, Haeger and Pikulshi set to work designed the 40-plus characters who populated CarnEvil, which then had to be built in 3D Studio Max (a modeling tool that's still used for modern games in a far more advanced form).
>
> ... ... ...
>
> "In '98, 3D modeling was pretty basic, but we felt we were cutting edge," says Pikulski. "Each character was a series of objects... [which] made it very easy to swap a clean, undamaged arm for a damaged, gory one. As I got better at it, I kept pushing the gore. Then I started doing object swaps. This let me have a bone sticking out, or a hole straight through someone."

Maybe models are just saved as directx .x format?
They must have had either the first or second installment of 3dsmax....judging by the games release on Halloween 1998.

Parts of the extracted file are still compressed.
Zlib 1.0.4 was used.
Easy to find that with any hex editor. Just search for Copyright.
The very last 2 finds will show Deflate and Inflate 1.0.4

So after that the file should be "fully readable"?
The only thing i ever Found with a hexeditor was a few character names. I thought this would be like start or Offset to their files.

What Hex Editor do you use?
I use 010 by SweetScape.

Still checking the names found searching for 'Copyright'
There's a lot one can learn from those.
For an example Google DJ Delorie.
3DFx Interactive Inc is also interesting. Anyone remember the VOODOO cards or the Glide API?

Based on the MIPS R5000 CPU? I'd suspect a UNIX type Operating System was used?

OOPS! Looks like BSD was used as the OS based on Copyrights.
Given that? One should be able to run FreeBSD and mount the RAW disk image!
Then you should be able to grab files as you wish and proceed from there.

Now I'll explain how I looked at this as it may help others down the line.
Given it seemed as a disk image? There's a lot of information in those that I used as research.
By searching for Copyrights I got a lot of information. The more one knows about any file? The better your chances.
I know zlib will be needed. I know parts of the file contains nothing I want. I know the probable OS so can adapt for that.
Maybe one can extract the files without loading a new OS and booting into that but what is faster?
For me? I'll boot FreeBSD and mount the image, grab things, then go from there.

As a good sign? Check out the TRAP command at the start of the file and check out the FreeBSD information.

for me, its easier to get all files from the file than trying to mount the image, which will fail anyway probably
yes, there are 1520 files, and the models are very small and simple
i dont see any reason to convert them



and this is my attempt to combine all parts of "mike" manually
of course, there is all information to do that properly with coordinates, but again, i dont see why it may be needed



p.s. watched the video. he was two-headed... and i was wondering what the other head is for?

ok here you go. I made these 2 simple programs (about 15 lines each) to get files.

Drop raw file onto carnevilraw, and it will split it into partitions. Only 1st one has all the files, others are music and videos. You can open music directly as 16-bit mono. About videos i'm not sure, but they must be something simple too.

Drop part0 onto carnevilpart, and it will get 1520 files. I was too lazy to make it properly read FAT table, while it would be also easy, so it will probably only work for this game, and not other arcade machines. Maybe not.

After that textures are very simple with a header telling its size and format, but the format is always the same as i believe.

ZM are model raw data. Coordinates, normals, then faces with all UVs. As you could see, i made a test to check them, but it requires reading model infos from the GAME.EXE

ZA are probably animations.

That didn't work out so well.

So is there tools available other than the granny-viewer ripping method?

You can use texture-finder for instance.
Or somebody skilled creates a quickbms or noesis script for .wms

TRUE! ^^
would still be great to have one to batch convert the textures.

are the 3d models just as simple as the textures are?

For some reason, the texture files only open sometimes, and the application is cut off at the bottom. I'm using texture finder v2.1, so I'm wondering if I got the wrong version or something.    I've tried looking up different versions of the program online but to no avail.

well, simple enough, just a little swap:

```

def registerNoesisTypes():
    handle = noesis.register("whatever", ".wms")
    noesis.setHandlerTypeCheck(handle, noepyCheckType)
    noesis.setHandlerLoadRGBA(handle, noepyLoadRGBA)
    #noesis.logPopup(); 
    return 1

def noepyCheckType(data):
    bs = NoeBitStream(data)
    if bs.readBytes(2) != b'\x05\x80': 
        print("wrong sig!")
        return 0
    return 1

def noepyLoadRGBA(data, texList):
    bs = NoeBitStream(data)
    dataOffset = 40
    imgWidth = 128
    imgHeight = 64        
    bs.seek(dataOffset)
    data = bs.readBytes(bs.getSize() - bs.tell())    
    data = rapi.imageDecodeRaw(data, imgWidth, imgHeight, "b5 g6 r5")
    texList.append(NoeTexture(rapi.getInputName(), imgWidth, imgHeight, data, noesis.NOESISTEX_RGBA32))
    return 1
```
(dunno whether the sig applies to all .wms files!)

def registerNoesisTypes():
    handle = noesis.register("whatever", ".wms")
    noesis.setHandlerTypeCheck(handle, noepyCheckType)
    noesis.setHandlerLoadRGBA(handle, noepyLoadRGBA)
    #noesis.logPopup(); 
    return 1

def noepyCheckType(data):
    bs = NoeBitStream(data)
    if bs.readBytes(2) != b'\x05\x80': 
        print("wrong sig!")
        return 0
    return 1

def noepyLoadRGBA(data, texList):
    bs = NoeBitStream(data)
    dataOffset = 40
    bs.seek(0x10)
    imgWidth = bs.readUInt()
    imgHeight = bs.readUInt()
    bs.seek(dataOffset)
    data = bs.readBytes(bs.getSize() - bs.tell())    
    data = rapi.imageDecodeRaw(data, imgWidth, imgHeight, "b5 g6 r5")
    texList.append(NoeTexture(rapi.getInputName(), imgWidth, imgHeight, data, noesis.NOESISTEX_RGBA32))
    return 1
```


btw: used scripts for getting textures from Ace and IronArthur as an inspiration - thanks for that!

Yes! I had a friend helping me with the textures....so we sat there and tried a few things (this is how i came up with the 2 kramphed variants)
This Tipp really did the trick ^^

EDIT:
The script works super well! Opens and reads almost every texture correct:

I noticed, that stuff like fonts, effects and sprite animations seem to be exported with a wrong palette or wrong colors:

I'm not a "palette fan".  

You may try out this swapping, though:
data = rapi.imageDecodeRaw(data, imgWidth, imgHeight, "r5 g6 b5")

(If it doesn't work, you need to search for the palette table and use it.)

I tried every combination ob rgb/565 possible...sadly without success.
I started out with your swap though, and it gave me this:

As far as models go, daemon1 already extracted them:

yes, there are 1520 files, and the models are very small and simple

However I cannot..... :-/
I might give it another try with hex2obj. But since most character models have alot of submeshes it requires reading alot of different vertex start adresses.

Here are the .zm files (and .zm2 ?)for:
-Maries Axe
-Final Boss Character Model
-Acid Bottle (should be simple)


So maybe you can give it a try yourself.
....or somebody skilled blesses us with a script

So, I've tried running the GAME.EXE like he said, but I have found it is 16 bit and cannot run on my Windows 10.  Can you open it? It was extracted with everything else so . . . .

You dont have to run the exe. You just need to take submesh tables for each model. Number of faces/vertices etc. Since its hardcoded into it, i dont think theres a way to do this automatically. I can give a few examples where they are if you cant find them yourself.

Please do. I've tried opening them into notepad, to see if any info about their models was there, but to no luck.

All the tables are inside the EXE among material/texture lists.
This is an example table for one of the models. 10 submeshes, and each submesh is fully described how many vertices/faces/etc it has.
I marked the whole table, and the first submesh in the beginning with red lines.

Yes, victim or spider, i dont remember what was the order.
I said textures were simple, not models. Models are somewhat far from modern layout. Its year 2000 style.

ok here's the layout of ZM file:

1. vertices array:  float x,y,z for each
2. normals array:  float x,y,z for each
3. faces array: 
  material (uint32)
  vertex index 1 (int16)
  vertex index 2 (int16)
  vertex index 3 (int16)
  normal index 1 (int16)
  normal index 2 (int16)
  normal index 3 (int16)
  UV1 (float x,y)
  UV2 (float x,y)
  UV3 (float x,y)

I'm not sure you can read it with hex2obj, maybe yes, maybe no

Alright so I tried a bit of hex 2 obj, and it dosen't seem to work with game.exe. however, it can open the zm files.I'm trying to find where all the start addresses are. Also, do you need to open the zm files, or the zm2? Sorry if I ask a lot of questions, I'm a bit of blabber mouth

But it's a helper tool only - there's no (useful) way around, imho, to do some coding to get more than one submesh or the uv data.

Oh man! Look at me! I'm like you shakotay  ripping models and stuff! Thanks to yours and daemon1s help of course!
.ZM seems to be the perfect format for me to learn and look for stuff!.....vertecies just start out with the first byte, right?

UVs would still be great! From there on ripping submeshes should not be a problem for us anymore!

But why would it make sense to store model info in the game.exe?
I mean sure theres gotta be info....but why don't you put submesh coordinates right after submesh vertex and face info?

(there's no "no PtC" size, btw - 34 is just the offset from end of previous face to start of the next face)

Usually, yes. But here none of the three uv sets gives me a decent uv map then while the point cloud doesn't look that bad. (Tried other combinations of the 6 float values - failed.)

there are no 3 uv sets. The uvs are 3 actual UVs for each vertex of a face. And they make proper UV map.

So is it solveable in hex2obj then? It sounds like getting the UVs is a little more complicated...

No, since models with Multiple submeshes (most of them) can only be Puzzled together with info from the game.exe as dameon1 said.

Although im pretty sure, that some can be out together manually.

But therefore we need uv-info...without we cant apply textures correctly

I have noticed that nearly all the textures and stuff are in part0 of the chd, but is their a way to rip more parts? I believe that their are still some more in other parts. Also I think it would be cool to rip the fmvs of the game.

daemon1 stated already what the other parts are about here:

Drop raw file onto carnevilraw, and it will split it into partitions. Only 1st one has all the files, others are music and videos. You can open music directly as 16-bit mono. About videos i'm not sure, but they must be something simple too.

Yeah, it would be great to have the FMVs! You should get some sample files and make a thread about it in the correct section:
[viewforum.php?f=36](https://forum.xentax.com/viewforum.php?f=36)
I'm pretty sure, that the members over there can fiddle them out

Usually, yes. But here none of the three uv sets gives me a decent uv map then while the point cloud doesn't look that bad. (Tried other combinations of the 6 float values - failed.)

there are no 3 uv sets. The uvs are 3 actual UVs for each vertex of a face. And they make proper UV map.

I dunno, but it sounds like you guys know how to handle the models uvs already. Could you shine light on ddadd and me on how to find them via hex2obj or did you use a custom script?

I already said everything how it works. Typical layout for year 2000.
I used my own code to get that skull and a few other samples. Its not a script.

I saw one of your older posts henchmen, and I saw that the Carnevil programs made my daemmon seemed to work similar in function, so I'll post the link again [http://wiki.pcbotaku.com/wiki/Extract_G ... m_MAME_CHD](http://wiki.pcbotaku.com/wiki/Extract_GD-ROM_files_from_MAME_CHD)

So daemmon sorry if I'm saying it wrong, in hex to obj do we copy the values from game.exe and paste?

again, as i said before, i dont know if hex2obj can support this layout.
from what i know, hex2obj can read UVs associated with vertices.
here UVs belong to faces.

(Tökkentäker uvs look bad but guess  sooner or later I'll get the trick. Maybe it's indexing the vertices instead of the uvs, like I did here.)

Great Job shako!!!
I was afraid i would never see some extractable carnevil models on the web. But thanks to you and daemon the little fanbase finally has new stuff of their favorite game in the waiting  

So i still didn't quite get it....
This Format uses faces as they appear flat on the model itself and uses them (unchanged) to share the uv-map?
Interesting...so uv-coordinates result from face coordinates in this case?

I exported to SMD, because its natural for this layout.
Dont know what the best solution if you try exporting to OBJ, but probably you need to split all vertices anyway, to avoid problems when same vertex has several different UVs.

Either way, is it possible to recompile the files back so we can make mods as well? It would be kinda cool if you could have it modded.

Surely it'd be just as easy to patch a file as to extract it? I mean it's not like you can't make new file types on your own.

All you need to do is get a folder with all the parts of the part0, edit them, compress it back into part0, grab it and all the other parts, compress them into carnevil.raw, then convert with chdman to carnevil.chd

....we are far from that.....
How about we first continue trying to get the correct uv-maps for the 3d models... so that we can start ripping them independently after some help from shakotay2 and daemon1.
Which brings us to the actual topic of....this topic...

Modding carnevil is a whole nother level...
And i Think it would be way more interesting to get the camera paths and animations in order to do some easier and big time graphical changes in unity or unreal

Ok I did some exploring with a hex editor and found that the part0 file had all the textures listed in the front, a little bit after that is the debug menu in readable code, and then is the music being repeated over and over with a texture underneath each repeat. Part 1 has an editors note about downloading and installing directory's in the front, but pretty much everything else I found after is unintelligible. Though there was some interesting code at the back where a symbol was spammed, had some code in it, kept being spammed, then switched to another symbol. this kept repeating for a while as well, so it may be interesting to find out what it is, maybe music start and stop points or fmv start and stop points.

so, is their any other way to rip the models? I was thinking maybe Ninja RIpper, but I don't know if you can use it through MAME since you can't rip game textures from mame. However, I did hear Direct X games are rendered through MAME not the CPU, so it's most likely textures of game are being run by the cpu but models aren't? Just a thought.

Anything? If Hex20BJ is to tough, we could always try model researcher. It seems it would work a bit easier.

How did you get those UVs?
I gave it try with simply projectiong from view and obvious seems...didn't come out quite as the original:


I've also uploaded the extracted model/textures and the blendfile with my unwraping.


 Maries AXE.zip
Textures, OBJ file, Blender file (221.73 KiB) Downloaded 16 times



I think it is at least the first somewhat finished model of Carnevil that is online, so.......yay

bump? I think I found out that it could be possible to edit the drawgfx c++ file in mame to rip from all mame games, something I believe most arcade rippers could be happy to know.

are you the one that submitted Maries Axe to models resource?
Because the Axe does not come with the original uvmap. Its a projection solution i came up with.
Check the GIF i made:

(The back of the Axe head and the bottom of the wooden stick (?) Arent unwraped at all and just Stretch a row of Pixels over the whole face.

No Problem with the upload for me just sayin in case you are the uploader, the uploaded Axe model from here is not accurate.

Would love to See more models in the site though 
I wanted to upload the acid Container that i ripped with daemons and shakotay2s help, since i thought it would be the easiest to get the uvmap. I failed though haha

Yeah I submitted it to the website. I don't get how you just rip the model you know? Maybe it just takes practice but I don't get it. It seems a lot more time consuming than it should be but idk.

Happy new year)

As i said before, submesh tables were in game.exe
So i made a little neural network to find and cut them from there, these files are included.
Most of them have names corresponding to characters (or their weapons) but some i was unable to link. You can guess it by looking inside they have texture names.

Then once you found a pair (tab file and ZM file), select them both and drop on Carnevilmodel.exe
It must create SMD file with all geometry, UVs and texture names. If it wont work, select them in different order and drop again.
Or run from command line:   Carnevilmodel.exe <some.tab> <some.zm>

Also note that non-square textures will require filling them up to square before applying to the model, or modifying UVs. Do whatever is easier for you.

Yet another image script, supports grey-colored images with alpha.

```

    handle = noesis.register("whatever", ".wms")
    noesis.setHandlerTypeCheck(handle, noepyCheckType)
    noesis.setHandlerLoadRGBA(handle, noepyLoadRGBA)
    #noesis.logPopup(); 
    return 1

    bs = NoeBitStream(data)
    if bs.readBytes(2) != b'\x05\x80': 
        print("wrong sig!")
        return 0
    return 1

def noepyLoadRGBA(data, texList):
    bs = NoeBitStream(data)
    dataOffset = 40
    bs.seek(0x10)
    imgWidth = bs.readUInt()
    imgHeight = bs.readUInt()
    bs.seek(0x24)
    imgform = bs.readUInt()
    bs.seek(dataOffset)
    data = bs.readBytes(bs.getSize() - bs.tell())    
    if imgform == 0x8:
        data = rapi.imageDecodeRaw(data, imgWidth, imgHeight, "r8 a8")
    if imgform == 0xa:
        data = rapi.imageDecodeRaw(data, imgWidth, imgHeight, "b5 g6 r5")

(Acid Bottle with corrected uv-map)

This is the uvmap for acid bath as of the extracted .smd file:


After correction:


Still some manual work to do but still very nice, thank you so much again 


For the noesis texture scripts:
Do I have to use this script for regular textures?

```

def registerNoesisTypes():
    handle = noesis.register("whatever", ".wms")
    noesis.setHandlerTypeCheck(handle, noepyCheckType)
    noesis.setHandlerLoadRGBA(handle, noepyLoadRGBA)
    #noesis.logPopup(); 
    return 1

def noepyCheckType(data):
    bs = NoeBitStream(data)
    if bs.readBytes(2) != b'\x05\x80': 
        print("wrong sig!")
        return 0
    return 1

def noepyLoadRGBA(data, texList):
    bs = NoeBitStream(data)
    dataOffset = 40
    bs.seek(0x10)
    imgWidth = bs.readUInt()
    imgHeight = bs.readUInt()
    bs.seek(0x24)
    imgform = bs.readUInt()
    bs.seek(dataOffset)
    data = bs.readBytes(bs.getSize() - bs.tell())    
    if imgform == 0xc:
        data = rapi.imageDecodeRaw(data, imgWidth, imgHeight, "b4 g4 r4 a4")
    else:
        data = rapi.imageDecodeRaw(data, imgWidth, imgHeight, "b5 g6 r5")
    texList.append(NoeTexture(rapi.getInputName(), imgWidth, imgHeight, data, noesis.NOESISTEX_RGBA32))
    return 1

```


And this one for half square textures with corrected alpha?

```

def registerNoesisTypes():
    handle = noesis.register("whatever", ".wms")
    noesis.setHandlerTypeCheck(handle, noepyCheckType)
    noesis.setHandlerLoadRGBA(handle, noepyLoadRGBA)
    #noesis.logPopup(); 
    return 1

def noepyCheckType(data):
    bs = NoeBitStream(data)
    if bs.readBytes(2) != b'\x05\x80': 
        print("wrong sig!")
        return 0
    return 1

def noepyLoadRGBA(data, texList):
    bs = NoeBitStream(data)
    dataOffset = 40
    bs.seek(0x10)
    imgWidth = bs.readUInt()
    imgHeight = bs.readUInt()
    bs.seek(0x24)
    imgform = bs.readUInt()
    bs.seek(dataOffset)
    data = bs.readBytes(bs.getSize() - bs.tell())    
    if imgform == 0x8:
        data = rapi.imageDecodeRaw(data, imgWidth, imgHeight, "r8 a8")
    if imgform == 0xa:
        data = rapi.imageDecodeRaw(data, imgWidth, imgHeight, "b5 g6 r5")
    if imgform == 0xc:
        data = rapi.imageDecodeRaw(data, imgWidth, imgHeight, "b4 g4 r4 a4")
    if imgform == 0xd:
        data = rapi.imageDecodeRaw(data, imgWidth, imgHeight, "g8 a8")
    texList.append(NoeTexture(rapi.getInputName(), imgWidth, imgHeight, data, noesis.NOESISTEX_RGBA32))
    return 1

```


I've also tried to recreate your hambone rip:

Download .blend file: [https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/ ... -issue.zip](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/550716715642781697/794751670726688838/hambone_blender_uv-issue.zip)

I had to flip all the uvs on the y-axe and they seem to be incorrect on some parts and single faces...i did a lazy job on putting them in place. I also converted the .smd to an .obj via noesis since blenders importer is a little restricted. Since the converted mesh came out as one object i seperated it by material....that also kinda kept a few supposedly individual meshes stuck together weirdly.

You dont have to correct UV map for Acid Bottle, its already correct as original.

you can use one (latest) script for ALL textures

Yes, some SMD importers flip UVs on Y. So once we decide what will be best way to import models, we know if they need to be flipped or not. I can flip them all during export in that case.

Next, "single faces" usually have non-square textures, and this is why i said they will require filling them up to square. Or you can do "lazy job" changing UVs, if you're sure this will be done well if you scale them exactly 2x times on Y.

Next, i really dont recommend seperating models by material, because this will break original composition of model parts, which makes separate object for each "skeleton bone", and this allows to easily connect them to a skeleton exactly in points where bones are supposed to be. Nothing was "stuck together weirdly", it was all in proper places. For example, cuffs of his wrists, his neck on the middle of his chest, etc.

As alternative, I can export SMD file as one object WITH a skeleton, where all parts will be weighted to their bones. Then you can move and rotate bones as you like, without the need to separate anything.

Are you sure?...you never really get to See the acid bath Container from the side ingame:

When i straight import the converted .smd the arrow-point-logo thingy on the ends isnt centered and cut off...but yeah sometimes game assets are like that :-p

yes, i'm sure. I checked it right before writing the message. the arrow-point-logo was properly centered.

ok, try this one.
it will export SMD file as one object WITH a skeleton, where all parts will be weighted to their bones
all you need to do is parent bones, and move them to their proper positions

i'm using blender source tools, and they work fine for me.

Thanks for the tip with source tools, this is great!
I've been using your new extractor, buit it seems like it created super tiny bones for hambone that are all in the same location....is that intended?


EDIT:
I think I got it working

yes
only animations is what makes these bones move
this is how games were done around 2000

Crazy...so the bones actually moved and were just treated like empties/Dummies that connect submeshes?

I know this is probably the most nube question you've ever heard, but how do I import the model into blender with textures? In noesis I can see the textures on the model just fine, but in blender the textures are all gone. If I go to material preview the whole model just turns purple. I'm probably really dumb and missing out on a super easy step, but I don't know what to do.

I'd assume that you would be using 2.8+, so this is for those versions

1. Select the model.
2. Go to the materials section (checkered sphere).
3. Switch the material from whatever Noesis exported to "Principled BSDF". (depends)
4. Locate the "Base Color" section.
5. Click the yellow dot, and switch to "Image Texture".
6. Press the folder icon and navigate to the texture.
7. Double click and you should have the texture loaded in.

That should be all.

Also I noticed that the actual model files of deaddy and the skeleton are missing from the extracted files. Not that the skeleton is particularly interesting in any way, but yes some of the models and stuff are missing.

Here's the bat model from carnevil. However, it seems that some models are messed up like the maggot and topsy turvy. Also it only allows me to move the parts of the body when I converted the model to fbx. Is this normal? Also working on the zombie

how do you parent bones? I was able to use henchmen's hambone blend to make it look like this,

but now you say there's a better and more accurate way I'd like to know.

WHat about za files? If they include animations, perhaps they can make the model in the right pose?

Hey, butting in real quick because I'm pretty interested in this game
I've spent the last couple of days setting up the character models and whatnot, thanks a lot for the tools! However i had a few misc issues;
• Like ddad pointed out, the files for Deaddy (bear) and the skeletons (skel) are completely missing, and I'm guessing that's because they're saved under different partitions, I tried exporting those other files but only 0 and another one (that I don't remember exactly) work, but the tab files are present in the zip
• Among those missing files, there's some misc textures that I also couldn't find, those being Tökkentäkker's damaged state textures and a couple of his accessories, Dr Klot's (doct) saw texture &, while actually there, Gool's face texture seems to be missing it's proper palette so it defaults to a glitchy yellow palette
• A weird issue is that, no matter what order I do it on, Flap-jack's (tops) model doesn't output anything, and that's the only character that has that problem
That's pretty much it, somewhat concise. Any help would be appreciated!

Oh thanks! Really fun to render low poly stuff, pretty simple to pick up
Also I'll see what I can do, I used Cinema 4D to do it so I'd have to check if I can find a way to export them with the rig positions and UV edits (most of them were just extending the UV's boundaries by 2 in a certain axis) intact, making sure they also work on Blender too. Might take a while, but it's probably doable

Took me a while, but I managed to get at least 5 of the ports done! Those being Betty, Broodle, Carnie, Dr Klot and Evil Marie (going by alphabetical order so I can remember better).
[Here's a GD folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1JODnIC47W6QbCWIK-4zJ0t9D0m3MSIa0?usp=sharing) with those and all the other files I could gather, I'll be updating it as I do each Blender port (which might take a couple days to get fully done)
There's also FBX files but those are mostly just stand-ins for Blender, for some reason it doesn't export with all the materials so I end up having to set them up on Blender again one by one, making it a little more time consuming than I'd hope for but I'm up for the challenge!
Take note that reseting anything after posing ends up completely butchering the models again, but besides that I also decided, after doing Broodle without it, that the bones for the maimed parts should still be there instead of them being set to a scale of 0 by default so remember that too!
Textures are also embedded to each file by default, pretty much it
Still curious about figuring out how to find the missing/broken stuff (I guess that would also include the zombie hats), mostly because there's only 3 characters missing entirely

Nice! I'll give you my junior 3d model through google drive in blend and fbx format, though my rig could be better. Also I just noticed that you can switch juniors mouth texture to make it animate.

Folder updated with 5 more models; Eyeclops, Flem & Mike, Gool, Guilloteen and Hambone!
Quick notes that I had to whip up an edit of Gool's face texture, along with an eye texture that fits (I don't think they're used in-game but they look alright here). Couldn't find the model for Hambone's flying skulls but I'm sure that's not too big of a deal
Also pretty nice port of Junior! I'd say it's on point

There's a handful of that here too, I think some other characters like Tinsel and Tort/Rodz have additional stuff like that with tab files under their codenames and etc

Nice! So I found out that flap jack and tort have some textures mixed up, so I used flap jack textures on tort to see if it looked good. Unfourtunatley it's not completely accurate to the game, but here you go

More characters done; Muertito, Niknak, Tökkentäkker (excluding bonus props like the fireworks which I also couldn't find the models for), Smeek, Smilin' Bob and the Termite, next update should probably be the last until we can figure out a way to get the missing characters!

Oh yeah I think I remember noticing that, didn't test it out but that's neat

nice keep up the good work! Something besides the models to think about is the bnk sound files. I know they use the digital sound system so I don't know how we will be able to run them but they are not the other common bnk sound file people are used to knowing.

Another batch done! This time it's Tinsel, Umlaut, Victim & the Zombie, not done yet since I didn't do Rodz & Tort as those'll take some time (50+ materials to set up)

Oh yeah, it'd be really nice to have some clean rips of the sounds. But yeah I'm more of a model rip person, haven't dwelved too much into the field of audio rips

Very, very good find! Seems like all we need is some sort of technical help to get these exported too, looks like it's all that we need

sweet! Umlauts model looks sick! Tort and rodz always kind of reminded me of beavis and butthead. Here's my try at tort, though not 100% correct.

And there we go, Rodz & Tort are uploaded! That wraps up the characters available atm, hopefully we'll find a way to get the ones that are missing for now
Also, new render (full-res version available on the GD folder for renders)!

Henchmen 800, if you have these files can you send them in a zip? Especially stuff like the party hats, deaddy and the skeleton. It seems like you might have some cause you uploaded deaddys textures on textures resource.

Thanks a lot!! Def keep me updated on the partition stuff, seems pretty close to figuring out!
Not sure about posting these on TMR, takes quite a while and not sure if these models in specific would work out for the formats they use (could do OBJ but that would strip the models of any possible posing)

They do .dae for rigged models...you then can also add an fbx.
OBJ for static models and DAE for rigged.

It would be cool if you guys keep it updated. and for the deaddy textures i really dont know how i did it....they were just there....i didnt use any other partition....however theres 2 versions of carnevil.CHD....they have like a difference of 3 files or so.

Well if you have anymore of the files I listed above pls share them. I don't think you should upload them to the models resource because they're at least a year behind in submissions. I would instead post them to sketchfab since sketchfab can take any main format.

maybe ill upload them someday then.
i dont have the files anymore sadly... my aproach would be getting both versions of the carnevi.CHD and export them both... all i did was extracting the CHD as described in this topic.

Seems like Henchman was right! I tried out the 1.0.1 files and I got nearly all of the missing files (only missing 1500-1503 but that's no biggie) and fixed some missing things, along with doing another new port. Other additions include Tökkentäkker's explosives and the party hats for the Zombie!
One unfortunate thing is that exporting Flap-Jack and Deaddy doesn't work at all, no matter the order or .tab file used. I've included Deaddy's .ZM files in his folder for now, hopefully we can get a fix for the tool
Another more minor thing is that Gool's face texture and some other textures still output with the wrong palette, but that's also not much of a big deal
We're closer than ever to having all the character models importable, hopefully we'll be able to finish it off soon!

Yeah hopefully we can either figure out how to edit the tab files or just decode the zm format. I was checking other game made with the same seattle hardware as carnevil, and I found out through cheat engine that they have some of the same filetypes so that would be interesting! Means we could potentially rip from arcade nfl blitz and mace the dark ages so that's neat.

yeah they're the same lol.  They might be downsized because these are textures for the pc release. However this is about carnevil so lets just focus on getting all the stuff from that first then we can move to other midway games.

I just figured out something that could help us out with the tab files not working! Notice the simularitys between model data in exe and tab files daemeon1 created (you can see in notepad by searching for texture names). Basically it's copied and pasted into the tab file but the beginning and a few other parts are slightly different. If we can find out this info we can possibly rip the tops and bear model, aka flapjack and deaddy.

okay i checked the two models you asked for, and:

- tops must work with FLAS_42.tab (i dont know why there were 2 tabs with his textures, but this is the right one)
- bear was special, his parts were not sequential, so i had to sort them, attaching the new TAB file for him

Good job daemon1! I'm glad we got the last of the models. Now something to think about is the fmvs and the sound effects. The sound effects use the dss, or digital sound system to play and they are not your average bnk files. Either way it would be pretty cool to see if we could ever do this kind of digging into other arcade games with chd's such as area51, nfl blitz, california speed, and others. I know some of the other midway games borrow the same formats.

.chd is a Format the mame devs came up with. Its used to compress and store hard drive based arcade games in a Uniform way.
