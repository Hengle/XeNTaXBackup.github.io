- Post Title: (360) Marvel Avengers: Battle for Earth .xpr

[One of the xpr files loaded up in XVI32](http://img854.imageshack.us/img854/1975/capture088j.jpg)

Pretty much everything is separately bundled up in these .xpr files (there's a lot of them) with the exception of the audio files (which are contained in .pck files) and the menu images which are everyday .dds images.

Will pm sample files to anyone that's interested.
