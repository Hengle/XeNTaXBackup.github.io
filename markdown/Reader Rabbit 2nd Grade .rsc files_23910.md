- Post Title: Reader Rabbit: 2nd Grade .rsc files

I know this is a strange game to extract assets from, but I'd like some help with retrieving the graphics (sprites, backgrounds, etc).
It appears that all the game data is stored in .rsc files. I have been able to extract all the audio using Ravioli Explorer and Dragon UnPACKer, but no graphics whatsoever.
I've linked a few examples of files in the game that I haven't been able to extract anything from. They may or may not contain graphics, but they definitely contain something. Any help would be appreciated, thanks!

Edit: Moderator ikskoks has informed me that the files appear to be old DOS executable files, despite having the .rsc file extension. Knowing this, the files can be read and analyzed by programs that can read executable files (if you change the .rsc file extension to .exe). Since I'm not knowledgeable about this stuff, I can't make heads or tails of any of the information in the files. If anyone wants to take a look them and take a crack at it, I would be very grateful.

Well, those are not archives, they seems to be Pascal DOS executables with MZP signature.
They are matching New Executable (NE) Windows file format
and they can be opened with tools like ExeScope, HT Editor, IDA and ResEdit if you change file extension to EXE.

See below how it looks from my side:

You could probably extract some raw resources and analyse code in IDA, but extracting working files is something that requires further investigation for sure.

Hey, thanks so much for replying. This is definitely new information to me, and at this point, any information helps. I'll look into it and see what I can do
