Do you have an archive somewhere i can download?
or a splitted archive? , so i could analyze it and see if there is anything
nice in there.

here is my ripper atleast: [http://jaedernaub.ath.cx](http://jaedernaub.ath.cx)

it supports detection and ripping of Sony VAG audio and TIM2
texture format, which is standard on the PS2. however
not all games uses these formats.

but maybe its worth a try

EVERY GAME is different file formats.
If u want the WHOLE game just make an ISO file.
Or simply DRAG AND DROP ur files.
But Each PS2 game has different file types, Take FFX for example, Its protected so well that the files ar ento only Encypted but there also HIDDEN and then they are Inside a DAT which is alos hidden.
So unless u SAY the game u want your not gonna get nowhere init

Depends?
What exactly do you want to extract from it?
Models/Characters?
Module or MOTION are most likely to contain the models and textures.
Ul need to tell us what files are inside each folder.
Sound is obviously Sound, and Movie is most likely INGAME movies, or even RECORDED videos.

NO1 has YET provided us with any Parts or even COMPLETE files rfom this game to look at, Thus we having nothing to go on.
We only know the type so far.
AND TYPE means NOTHING lol, ie: FFX character.dat is 100% different from Sonic Heros STAGE.DAT.
But there BOTH ending in .DAT.
So yes is someone provides a file to look at then some of us will take a look.
