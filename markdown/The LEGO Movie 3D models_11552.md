- Post Title: The LEGO Movie 3D models

Does anyone know of a way to extract 3D models from The LEGO Movie video game?
I have seen an unpacker for the .dat/.hdr files but I cant work out after that what all the files inside are (other than the audio) or how to get at the 3D models or any other data.
