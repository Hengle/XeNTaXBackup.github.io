Yeah
The way to modify the localization file you gave just works fine.
But my problem is how to append word that font file doesn't have.
I've tried to modify the font swf file, but doesn't work.

No, there aren't subs. =/

Anyway, for the Hungarian translation i changed the language to German it has got some nice chars like (öüóőúéáűí<-these are needed for me). But i don't know how can be the font file edited.

Bump!
I think no updates will be released to this game so, i would like to ask again! Please someone try to trick the file defend system (even if it works only with warez releases), i would be very grateful if my translation will work not only with the unpached version. Thank you, if someone can check it out for me!
