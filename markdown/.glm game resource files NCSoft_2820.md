- Post Title: .glm game resource files NCSoft

Does anyone know specifically how to extract the models and textures from .glm?  Using MultiEx I was able to scan them for images, but it was only able identify the texture (.dds) files.  This format was used for Auto Assault, and is now being used for Tabula Rasa.

My intent is to be able to extract the models and textures to create artwork for a fansite for TR.

Adding some files for those interested

[Lights.glm 444k](http://www.marconus.com/lights.glm)
[Particles.glm 2.31m](http://www.marconus.com/particles.glm)
[specialfx.glm 3m](http://www.marconus.com/specialfx.glm)

Other files still uploading.

Also when testing the download, browser (and my server) said they were XML files.  opened one, and it indeed has XML tags, but also alot of trash.

Format is same between AutoAssault and Tabula Rasa, I wrote an extractor for this back in AutoAssault beta days, simple format.

There's a dword offset at the end of the file, seek to this (it's an absolute offset). You should land at a CHNK definition, followed by BLXX.

Following this:

dword nameoffset
dword unknown
dword filecount

following data repeats for filecount

dword filedataoffset
dword filecompressedsize
dword fileuncompressedsize
dword filenameoffset
dword unknown
word unknown

the filenames you can seek to nameoffset + filenameoffset (absolute) and read null terminated filenames.

First of all, couple weeks ago I made unpacker for GLM files.

PS: Unfortunately I'm sinked in work and don't have a time to complete my tool.
