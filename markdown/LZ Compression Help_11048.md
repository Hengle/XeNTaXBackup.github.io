- Post Title: LZ Compression Help

Hey all, I am working on a project common to many コナミ games. The compression in use is an LZ variant and there is a decompressor:

However, the problem is I lack a means to make a compressor, and not just any compressor but an efficient one. It needs to be very efficient so that the files can fit in the same or smaller space. I am specifically looking at the FB variant not the GFX variant in that source code (though they are VERY similar). Is anyone able to help with this?
