michalss, Ð°nd conversely, I want to convert ogg to idxma, for replace original sound)
it seems like a normal xWMA sound (xWMAEncode.exe tool), but different header.

OrangeC,
file structure:

4 byte - unknown, probably header
4 byte - offset to files table (big endian)

files table:
4 byte - files count (big endian)
for each file:
4 byte - filename length (little endian... what a hell?  )
filename
4 byte - file begin offset (big endian)
4 byte - file length (big endian)
