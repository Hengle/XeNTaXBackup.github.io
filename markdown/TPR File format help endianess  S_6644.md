- Post Title: TPR File format help endianess ? :S

TPR is the archive for doa4/doax2

I know how endianess works my question is, do we only worry about endianess when we are writing a c program to interpret the bytes? 
The file is STORED Big endian d/words so I assume when I have extracted the file from the AFS file the OS doesn't convert it to store it as little endian file ? So when I write a C program I should have it swap the bytes so that I don't read it backwards ? Am I on the right track ? 

Also can someone lead me to where I might find help ihnformation on transfer those index buffers and vertex buffers into a 3ds mesh file format?  

Thanks
