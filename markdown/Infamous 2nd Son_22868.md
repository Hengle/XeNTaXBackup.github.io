- Post Title: Infamous 2nd Son

Infamous 2nd Son tool.

Same as for Ghost of Tsushima, only main characters supported.

Usage: drop .XPPS file onto the tool. This will produce ASCII file with model, additional SMD file with skeleton, and text file with material/textures description. Textures will be exported to "textures" subfolder. Unlike Ghost of Tsushima, they don't have names, but only hashes. Some textures are common (teeth etc), they are in core_common.sprig.xpps

Submesh names will have LOD numbers in the end. For example "06" means this submesh presents in all LODs from 0 to 6. Highest LOD is usualy "01", lowest is "45".
