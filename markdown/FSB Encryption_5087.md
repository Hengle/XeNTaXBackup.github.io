- Post Title: FSB Encryption

I've got a FSB audio file from the PC version of Blade Kitten.

Most of these FSB files convert using towav but there are a few which are encrypted and thus I cannot convert.

Is anyone willing to take a look at it and see if they can figure out the key?

Also, for future knowledge, would the key change file to file or is it universal across the encryption algorithm for the game in question?

EDIT: Added a link to 3 other FSB's used in cutscenes that also have encryption I believe.

EDIT #2: I'll try extracting the archive again using that script Aluigi posted and see if there's a change.

EDIT #3: It seems the new script works. Thanks hcs and also to aluigi for your help.

It just looks compressed, not encrypted.

[edit] There's a discussion of Blade Kitten in [viewtopic.php?f=10&t=5070](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=5070) , maybe you were using the tool that doesn't decompress?

Didn't see that, but my Blade Kitten rip is up now on the shrine anyway. I just used the Xbox 360 version instead.

But for second installment of this game, I'll try using that script that aluigi linked.

Thanks hcs.

EDIT: Actually, I noticed that had I used that exact same script to extract the RKV archive. I must of forgotten I got it from here.

EDIT #2: I wasn't using that script. It was another one similar to it but it didn't decompress. The new script does and I tested it on the PC version and it works great.
