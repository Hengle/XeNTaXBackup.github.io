Heyy,
I've been looking to rip some models off MGS4. There were at least two maxscripts to import .mdn files, but unfortunately I don't have access to 3ds max. The .mdn format is mostly documented so I decided to look into this myself. I got a barebones blender importer that can do vertex positions and faces. Also supports batch import.

This would be my first on writing a blender plugin and fiddling with byte level data, so I'm kinda suprised I got something useable.



I tried to do bones, too, but couldn't find much reference on blender's end. I'll try to keep working on it and appreciate any input.

These helped me a lot:

EDIT:
UVs added, seems to produce correct results.

Do these come with assigned textures?

No, also no UV's or anything. But I did intend to work on this next. I haven't looked at it much yet, but I expect to find "filenames" for the textures, which should make it easy.

Ah, a shame. The maxscript is pretty handy, but having no assigned textures makes it hard to use, since the texture files just have number strings as names.
