- Post Title: Dissidia NT g1l BGM

I search around and it looks its not easy to convert that format. As I read here:

[https://github.com/losnoco/vgmstream/issues/259](https://github.com/losnoco/vgmstream/issues/259)

They may be a way, but, sadly, I don't know to extract a header or whatever the process involve it should done.
Less if the process should be done on HxD or just simple Notepad++.


If anyone can give me some guidance on how or what I should do, will be appreciate.

PS: on the link they're files as example

Those files have a 28-byte header and then a RIFF/WAVE file.  Those 3 files all contain 1 audio file.

You can use the Simple Cutter feature of VGMToolbox to cut the first 28 bytes, rename the files as *.at9 and they will play in Foobar with the vgmstream plugin.
