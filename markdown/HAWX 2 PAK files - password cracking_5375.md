- Post Title: HAWX 2 PAK files - password cracking

Hi there,

I am trying to get the password for the HAWX2 PAK data files and was wondering if anyone had tried decrypting before, and if so what programs did you use to get the passwords.

I am currently trying to open the files by assuming the PAK file is just a big zip file, and therefore running zip/rar file password crackers, but no joy.

Is it possible the password is buried in the game code somewhere? My other option is to wait for the game to be cracked on a torrent and see if I can open the files this way.

Any help of advice would be much apprecited.

Cheers

Thanks for the help, but this is the password for HAWX1. HAWX2 was only just released today.

A user over at the Ubisoft HAWX2 forums named "husker111" seems to have cracked the data3.pak file.

> I got the stock .dds files from one of the data.pak files in the HAWX install directory (I foret which one) and decrypted it using freely available software from the web in about 10 minutes.

He never explained which program he used. He also says he's been unable to crack the data.pak containing the models.

As far as I know Ubisoft wants people to pay to unlock the additional content found in the game files. With HAWX1 this was easily hacked and allowed PC users to access all the content for free! I think they have wised up and have encrypted their files more heavily this time around to prevent this sort of thing from happening again. Thus I don't think we'll get access to the files any time soon.

I doubt the game has better encryption, it's likely just a different password (or even different passwords per archive).

I don't have the game (and don't plan to buy it - no thanks UbiDRM) so I can't look into the password situation myself.

It should be easy doing it by asm. Can someone upload exe+dlls? In theory I should need the whole game running but maybe I'm lucky...

Can I ask something?

If I want to recompress the extracted files to data3.pak.
Which compression method needed to use?
Winrar ZIP-Normal, or Winrar ZIP-Fast?
Or 7zip?

Didn't saw this one   , maybe the password is not ment as a protection, rather than a technique to verify that the archive is not corrupt or something like that.

Just wondering, did you get it from the raw in HAWX2.exe with a hex-editor? I founded the same string in it :
(This is from france retail so I assume that the code is the same for everyone...)

```
....data/...data\
....üÍ. SN..T±.
.&N.ÐON..PN.0PN.
vÜ..PPN.pPN.ÀPN.
àPN..QN.€&N.orbi
t\..missions....
\...pF5hfGe2Tfrb
Ge8IzaRtXsIm....
.üÍ.ÀXN..T±..VN.
.VN..T±. VN.°VN.
PWN.ðWN. ¬_. XN.
 ¬_.0XN._th.%s\%
```

It doesn't looks that Ubi was trying to hide the stuff to the modders. I found this very paradoxal looking at their DRM...
I tried to modify some stuff in the scripts but it's not really powerfull... I also wonder how to open the .mdl, .gbe and .gbr to modify and/or make missions. I haven't found out how to read them.
