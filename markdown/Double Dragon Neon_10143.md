Funny I actually know a guy in los angeles named jimmy hoo... If thats you, big lol at finding you here. But anywayz the data in neon is garbage dont really see obvious vertex and index buffers. Doesn't look like they are obscuring data in any way just looks like a funky format.

  no sorry my name is james but not jimmyhoo(I just like how it sounds    ) 

thanks for the reply, too bad the format dont give any clue, but thanks for trying, I dont have acces to the files anyway(I purchased it in ps3) maybe in the near future someone decrypt the data and share the models

thanks

to try to make it easier here is the .pak file I have no idea how to open, cant find a tool

here is for linda.pak (its too big just for one mesh, probably includes other things like textures and sounds)

this is for linda_p.pak (I think this includes things for the vaiants of linda, maybe the whip's mesh and textures are here)

Ok, I have been reading the tutorials and aparently the game models are with the format GR2(granny maybe)

checking with a hex editor(I am using bless in linux)the linda.pak file mention it contains the following namefiles

linda_2.gr2
linda_2_alt.gr2
linda_2_alt2.gr2
lindahead_alt1_emotions.gr2
lindahead_emotions.gr2

and the linda_p.pack mention a big list of .anb files(the names correspond to animations) and a .pfb(fx_linda) file some files seems to be inside directories, couldnt find the textures

someone have some experience extracting files?

if the files are really in granny format then its not a big problem to obtain the model but I dont know how to extact the grn2 files from the pak

please help
