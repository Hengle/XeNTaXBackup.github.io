Fatduck,

Please upload it on rapidshare so I can have a look at the files. My browser doesn't support java as sendspace requires. I'll probably have some tools which can help you,

Basically, you should not withhold information here from others. Are you planning on posting the final results here? This forum is about sharing information, not in secrecy. Your nickname suggests you have a sharing mind

Hey MrMouse,

I pm'd you my explination, it has nothing to do with secrecy, but I just don't want to spam the thread with too much data, see details in pm.
