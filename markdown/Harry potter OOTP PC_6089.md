heey guess i want to rip some 3d models for this game and i think they are in the .big files
but i can't get them open yet, and i can't find a quick bms file for this game.

i will include a .big file when i am online the next time.

many thanks

heey guess

i have looked true data.big, data2.big, data3.big and data4.big.
and i have found some file extensions there.

- .int
- .str
- .sdt
- .str.ffs (or its just .ffs)
- .shd

i think myself they models are in the .str and .str.ffs (or .ffs files)
