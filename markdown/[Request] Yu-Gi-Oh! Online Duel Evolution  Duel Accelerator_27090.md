- Post Title: [Request] Yu-Gi-Oh! Online Duel Evolution / Duel Accelerator

(This is a repost of my thread on ragezone)

Hello and thanks for reading this thread about the discontinued Yugioh MMO, Yu-Gi-Oh online (Duel Evolution/Duel Accelerator)

We recently created a discord server regarding the archival and potential restoration of those games.

Since the creation of the Discord server, we uncovered serveral old clients that were considered to be lost.
But we're still looking for any relevant data some people might still have on their computers or old hard drives.

We're mainly focusing on Ygo2 right now, since it appears that version would be the easiest to restore, even though only server traffic of ygo3 exists, but that version uses an external library for server related stuff (easymultiplayerlib)

As of now, none of those games can be played online, but dueling in the debug menu of the ygo2 06 beta build works kind of, and a user unaffiliated with our discord server created an offline patch for ygo3, that lets you access some of the games menus.

This is a Video of the ygo2 beta build uploaded by derplayer who's also on the discord server: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjQGjor7g8A](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjQGjor7g8A) 

Here's our archive, where you can find the clients that are currently archived.
I think two are still missing there, which can be found only on the discord server right now.

If you are intersted in that project or would like to contribute, feel free to leave a message here or join the discord server.

Thanks for making it this far and have a wonderful day/night

notadeveloper on discord contacted me trying to scam me by claiming to have Code of that game, I'm not sure if he found out about our discord server on here, he wanted 10.000 USD and after providing clearly faked screenshots he was very demanding in getting payed for "his work"
