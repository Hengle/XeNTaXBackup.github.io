- Post Title: Steelrising Localization - SPK and STC files

Hello all friends, I need to translate Stellrising game, but I ran into a problem, I hope you can help me. The game engine is Silk, with which Greed Fall is also made by Nacon. The translation language of the game has two files that I will post for you to check, the spk and stc files. The game texts are located in the spk file. It can be extracted with any compres tool, for example. 7zip, when I put my translated text into the spk file, it shows the code in the game that the problem is from the stc file, most likely, now I need your help to solve this problem and be able to translate the game.
sorry may bad english

this files:
