- Post Title: Any proper tutorial on extracting PS4 .psarc files?

Hello. A few months back I got a pkg file for Kamen Rider Climax Fighters. The game is made with unity engine so as expected the files should be easy to access, but as I explored the contents, I could find everything but the game music for it. There was a 2 GB .psarc file however, even after enough digging around on the web, I wasn't able to extract its contents, and I only ended up with 2 files worth 30kb. Does anyone know a proper method on how to extract these kind of files? I'll leave a link to the .psarc file here if someone could help out as reference. Sorry if this is posted in the wrong section, I'm new to the forms. Thanks.

Is this like a standalone app? From what I'm getting online, should I just get the base app and look for unity related files within?

extraction is one thing, parsing the extracted content is another,
i am not a unity expert, i just use Asset Studio to open unity packages.

Worked like a charm. Files came as .assets and were open able in asset studio. Got the music file I was looking for. Huge thanks!
