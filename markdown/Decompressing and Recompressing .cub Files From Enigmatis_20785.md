- Post Title: Decompressing and Recompressing *.cub Files From Enigmatis

Looking for software that will decompress *.cub files from Enigmatis The Ghosts of Maple Creek Collector's Edition for Windows 

```

```


And then create new *.cub files from scratch (preferably using the same software that was used to decompress original *.cub files).

I know that there is a script for QuickBMS that allows decompression of *.cub files and then allow reimporting files in to *.cub files, but QuickBMS does not, apparently, allow creation of *.cub files from nothing, it can only reimport into existing *.cub files.

Unpakke is one program that allows decompression and (re)compression of some game files but it doesn't seem to support *.cub files yet.

Is there software available that will enable decompression (unpacking) and (re)compression ((re)packing) of *.cub files?
