- Post Title: [*.CPK] .hack//Link(PSP) - New version of CRI file format?

Hello guys   
I'm new here and I need your help with unpacking this type of file.

This game uses CRIware compression and both loaddata.cpk and data.cpk contains the table file inside them.
There are some tools out there but I can view or extract only a few files from this bigfile(data.cpk).

From those few files I've managed to extract from data.cpk I've discovered a new type of files - *.CCS
I'll also need extract these files to get images and 3D models.

Here are the files:
Loaddata.cpk [http://www.sendspace.com/file/upcnpm](http://www.sendspace.com/file/upcnpm)
Data.cpk [http://www.sendspace.com/file/px4c3s](http://www.sendspace.com/file/px4c3s) , cutted, compressed(7zip)

Thank you for any help

the script for this type of files is:
[http://aluigi.org/papers/bms/cpk.bms](http://aluigi.org/papers/bms/cpk.bms)

BUT there is some incongruence with the files of this game because it fails to catch a correct offset and size for some reasons that are not clear after a first look.
then debugging this type of archive is not the most easy thing of the world

I actually tried your tool and some other tools for unpacking this file, but with no luck.
Thank you for the quick reply,your interest and may I ask why debugging this type of archive isn't that easy?

Anyway if you want something from me, please let me know and I'll try to help you.
(Sadly I'm not a programmer, so I won't help you with programming   )

The oddity seems to be that the TOC offset is being used instead of the Content Offset, which is bizarre but there it is.  So I think just modifying the bms script from:

```
math file_offset += content_offset
```

to

```
math file_offset += toc_offset
```

ought to work.  I tested it on the loaddata.cpk and it seems to match up with what I'm seeing in the big cpk.

I'll update cpk_unpack with this eventually, I don't want to release it without directory and large file support, though, and that's a pain to do (and test).

well done hcs.
I have updated the script for supporting both the methods using a simple trick (the lower is the right one) so that the compatibility with the older archives is not broken.
if you have a better idea to guess the right toc or content offset to add then let me know :)

Hmm, that's a good way to handle it, I hadn't realized before that the TOC here is before the file contents rather than after.  I wonder what precipitated this change...
I think I'd rather do it by detecting Version = 5, though.  You've seen more of these files than me, but it seems like a new design direction (or possibly a bug).
There's also the possibility that my handling of the master CPK table is off... I can't think of any other interpretation that makes more sense, though.

Thanks guys.You're the best! It worked!

I will need one more thing..examine those *.CCS files to get images and 3D models.
But I'll start a new topic for that.
Thanks again.
