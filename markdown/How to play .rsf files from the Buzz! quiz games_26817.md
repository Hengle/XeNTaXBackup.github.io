I'm trying to convert the .rsf audio files from Buzz: Quiz World to a playable format, but so far I haven't succeeded. I provided two sample files below. Some other user on the forum made a QuickBMS script a long time ago to convert .rsf files to .at3 ([viewtopic.php?f=13&p=43826](https://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=13&p=43826)), but I haven't managed to find a program that was able to play those converted files. Does anybody here have any clue?
