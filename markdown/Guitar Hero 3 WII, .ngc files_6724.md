- Post Title: Guitar Hero 3 WII, .ngc files??

One day I had nothing better to do, and I decided to extract some characters from Guitar Hero 3. I chose WII, beacuse I found the WII games quite easy to extract from.
But this game has models in .ngc format??
I went to Google, nothing appears.
I went here: nothing (altough there was a small mention)
So as you can see, I had no luck trying to extract these files. If someone can help me, I'd appreciate it.
And here is a sample:
