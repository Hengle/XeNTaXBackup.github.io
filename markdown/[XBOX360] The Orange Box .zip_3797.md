I have successfully extracted everything using quickbms and the [zip.bms](http://aluigi.org/papers/bms/zip.bms) script

Thanks! I have another question. I unpacked it, but I do not know the format of the sound. In the header - XWV. I do not know how to play it. Help, please, who knows.

That's an XMA file - custom header. Find an XMA header and replace the custom header with this one, then run it through ToWav by xplorer.

Works "towav" to convert all the audio only changing the header? and xma2encode to encode?
And how repack the zip0.360.zip.

I want to add voices from PC versi√≥n, but i dont know how.

Thanks.
