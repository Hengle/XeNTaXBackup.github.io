[This video will show you how to unpack .fat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wssj7gZN8Ic) and you can import .xbg files with [this Maya script.](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?p=101460&sid=60c02512014ff94c9cd9b1331207ef73#p101460)
It doesn't support that many models though.

NinjaRipper works fine.
