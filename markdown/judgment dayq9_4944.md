- Post Title: judgment day/q9

Hello,
Has anyone tried extracting sounds from these two games? They're both games made for the blind, but they have some interesting sounds/music. Q9 has some of the best battle sounds and music I've heard in a sidescroller. Judgment day has some nice humour bits and spaceships etc.
I tried q9's soudns.dat with game extractor but all i got was some encrypted folders and garbled files and I have no experience with hex editors whatsoever.

I have a file called files.rar. if anyone can help me out I'd appreciate it. This file contains sounds.dat from q9 which is 23mb and a jmd file from judgment day which is one of the nicer musics in the game so you can have a look.
Thanks.
