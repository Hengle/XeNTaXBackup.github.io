Here's what the DataPC.wad looks like



It's possible to rip, [https://tcrf.net/Happy_Tree_Friends:_Fa ... _(Windows)](https://tcrf.net/Happy_Tree_Friends:_False_Alarm_%28Windows%29) just not documented.

edit Not Source/goldSRC, tcrf has this on it



edit Well son of a bitch

So I managed to find a converter. This one
[http://3doc.i3dconverter.com/index.html](http://3doc.i3dconverter.com/index.html)
However, it's conversion deletes the UV maps (that or the UV maps are stored in another file)


So unless anyone's willing to rip the converter from 3D Object Converter and fix it we're fucked.
