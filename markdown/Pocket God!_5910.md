Well, after searching relentlessly through the files of Pocket God, I've found the graphic files. How to view them though is somewhat confusing. Using Tile Molester I've figured out the proper codec, but I am unable to determine the palettes properly.
The specs are Mode 2-Dimensional and the codec is one of the 16bpp, any of them really work, but I'm not sure which is the 'proper' one.

Take a look at these files.

Notably 'TextureAtlas0.raw16' and 'TextureAtlas1.raw16' with the previously mentioned specifications and the viewer at max width.

Can someone help me out here?

Hahaha, that's awesome. This is one of my favorite Ipod touch games. I hope someone figures this out soon.

Here's an updated link to all necessary files.

Apparently these each have a MacBinary 2 header...whatever that means...

Egh...macintosh formats...how I hate them. I've been messing with these in jaeder naub's raw viewer and can see the graphics...sort of. How to properly extract them is anyone's guess...I hope we get someone on this soon, though the MMF and Scott Pilgrim is more important to me.

Another update to the game, another update to the files!

The sooner we figure this out, the sooner we'll be able to get the graphics of every other update as they come out! 

Any help at all would be appreciated...
