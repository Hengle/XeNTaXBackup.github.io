- Post Title: Extracting GetAmped2 .kxr files??

Hey all.

I've been trying for quite some time to unpack GetAmped2's .kxr files. The game is developed by [Cyberstep](http://www.cyberstep.com/). Cyberstep also developed [Onigiri](http://onigiri.cyberstep.com/home), and surprisingly enough, it stores all its data in .kxr files as well, yet the Onigiri script that I found on this site does not work on GetAmped2's .kxr files.

I discussed this with Luigi, and according to him, "the developers have obfuscated all the header of the archive, that's why quickbms can't find the "kxrf" signature and is not possible to read the rest of the information." Could anyone else possibly take a crack at it for me? I love the game and I would greatly appreciate it if someone could get me into these files.


Here's the bin folder where all the .kxr files are stored. These are the files that are updated with every patch and based on their sizes it's clear that these .kxr files are archives.



Here's the download. The files will be located in the bin folder: http://download.getamped.com/GetAmped2_US_setup.exe

Thanks again.
