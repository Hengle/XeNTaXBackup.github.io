- Post Title: How to do with the text extracted from Assassin'screed unity

Hello,guys!Good day！
I'm a assassin's creed fan from China.
As you know,there are many in-game dialogues in Assassin's creed unity.However I can't trigger them in many circumstances. Considered as a essential part of the story,I really need these dialogues.To get a full gaming experience,I play missions again and again.Finally I find that I couldn't trigger all the in-game dialogues. It almost drives me crazy.
Several days ago a idea occured to me that I could read all the dialogues from the text extracted from DataPC.forge file.
(By the way,Thanks to ARchive_next!)
I try to open the file" LocalizationPackage_English_Subtitles.6E3C9C6F" in Notepad++,it failed.
I tried encode in ANSI, UTF-8, UCS-2 Little Endian. None  of them could read it correctly.
could anyone help me? Was the text encrypted？How to deal with it?
Sorry for my poor English,hope it never bothers you.

It is very complicated format(at least for me, my friend help me to understand it), compressed and encoded with custom method. I was working on text repacker, but it is not finnished coz i have no much time this days..

Thanks，but it still seems complicated for me.I don't know how to set up all the options in custom method. could you speak a little more specifically? 
Or do you have any software to suggest?

No i cannot explain it, sotware does not exit till i write one. I cannot even make binary template for this, really hard and stupid format. U have to wait till i find time to finnish it or make one on your own im afraid...
