- Post Title: Hunt Showdown Pak Decryption

From what we've heard, Hunt's Paks have had their encryption changed and they have yet to be cracked.
The game has a lot of good audios, models, and textures that would be beneficial if open.
Anyone have solutions?
Redirecting us to other sources would also be helpful.

- Post Title: Hunt Showdown Pak Decryption

Hello! I myself am not strong in coding, but in the open sources I found a link with assets and models from Hunt.
I hope in the near future someone will be able to try to break the code on the modified pak files
