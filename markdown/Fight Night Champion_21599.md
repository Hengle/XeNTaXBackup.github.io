I'll tell you what I have so far and hopefully someone will chime in and point me in the right direction.  I have managed to extract the .big file which contains 12,886 files and extract these files using BIG FILE EXTRACTOR.  However, I have very little information about the .GEOM file and what I would need to either open/extract its contents or convert it into a format that 3Ds Max will understand.  From what I read, I believe that this .GEOM file contains the mesh, skeleton of the model, but I could be wrong.

Inside this .BIG file I can see the following files.
.GEOM   (a mesh file)
.CRSF    (also a mesh file?)
.GTF     (the texture file)

I was able to come across a very old topic where another individual was trying to do the same, but no one helped him.  I am trying to do this as a favor to someone who wanted to bring Isaac Frost into his wrestling game.  I can do that once I get it into 3Ds Max.  I tried using another script I came across here from Goldeneye to open the .GEOM file, but it didn't recognize it.  I am about to throw in the towel(no pun intended) as everything leads to a dead end, and tell him to forget it.  So in the off chance that someone around here has worked on this particular game before or similar files, your help would be appreciated.

Okay, I was able to convert the .GTF texture file into .DDS which is what I need thanks to Acewell posting the link to the .GTF tool .

Now I only need the last two files deciphered.

.CRSF
.GEOM

Will keep searching.

Hi friend. I am looking at the same as you. I found a software to open the models but it requires paid license to export. Is called 3d object converter.hopefully someone can write us up a free solution
