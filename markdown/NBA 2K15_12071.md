NBA 2K15's archives actually open with 7-zip, except only two small files in these large archives show up. That's really all the info I have. The files have no extension whatsoever. Not sure If I'm allowed to post any archives. The NBA 2K modding scene is fairly large, and fairly popular, and I'm hoping someone here can give a helping hand.

Hi, you exactly did you open the archives with 7zip?

I am working on the archives for 2 days now, i am planning to write an explorer for this. The archives contain tons of normal zip files using LZMA compression as well as some gzip files using lzma compression. 

[viewtopic.php?f=21&t=12065](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=21&t=12065) aluigi has posted a great way to decompress those gzip files, and i think one can write a quickbms script to get all the files from the archives.

Thanks alot, by the way.

Theoretically its possible yes, but its a very difficult procedure because of the size of the archives as well, they are huge. I also can't see any folder like structure l ike it is in other games, so i don't think that the game is capable of reading files from folders instead of the archives. Modding 2k15 will be tough this year

I used a program called Offzip to search inside the 2K15 files for compressed data.  Looks like the DDS images are swizzled.

I've made a topic over here [viewtopic.php?f=18&t=12076](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=18&t=12076). It does not seem like a swizzled texture to me, it would be much worse. Something else is going on...
