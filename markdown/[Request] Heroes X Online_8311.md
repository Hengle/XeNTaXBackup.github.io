Client link? Homepage?

You can see that a lot of the models have 10k+ vertices, but then there's all this other data before I get to the vertex and index buffers.

Vertices are 64 bytes each.
It gives you the size of the vertex buffer and the size of the index buffer, so you can calculate how many vertices/indices there are.

Maybe this applies to other unknown sections as well.
