- Post Title: Cutscene Dialogue from KH3 PC

Hey there, does anyone know where to find the cutscene dialogue in the files of the KH3 PC Port version?? I'm making a KH3 Based mod for OG KH2FM but will be porting it to the pc version once it's complete but I don't know where the cutscene dialogue is in the files of kh3 and I checked the sounds resource but I could not find the cutscene files on there kh3 page anymore so I'm wanting to rip them myself, any help is greatly appreciated.


Regards
Necro Malice~
