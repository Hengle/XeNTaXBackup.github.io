I managed to unpack the RSL files and I got these model files, I know that No More Heroes has the same format after looking on research on it but no scripts to view the model or a noesis plugin, Any Help?, Samples: [https://www.mediafire.com/file/iimec06h ... s.zip/file](https://www.mediafire.com/file/iimec06hylrz879/BLOOD++One+Night+Kiss+GA2+GM2+samples.zip/file)

would this also be possible for No More Heroes 2's GM2 Format? since BLOOD+ are so similar to no more heroes, some samples: [https://www.mediafire.com/file/9biz6vy2 ... s.rar/file](https://www.mediafire.com/file/9biz6vy2z7pktth/NMH2+GM2+samples.rar/file)
