- Post Title: tales of the world radiant mythology 3 - startup error

Hello,
Can someone translate this thing?

It always pops up as soon as I start the game on my PSP and when I press O it closes itself. When I use emulator it works without any problem.
Thank you.

The first line transcribed is "正規のシステムソフトウェアを?知できませんでした。" (note the character I couldn't transcribe, marked as a red question mark), and translates to [something like](http://translate.google.com/#ja/en/%E6%AD%A3%E8%A6%8F%E3%81%AE%E3%82%B7%E3%82%B9%E3%83%86%E3%83%A0%E3%82%BD%E3%83%95%E3%83%88%E3%82%A6%E3%82%A7%E3%82%A2%E3%82%92%20%E7%9F%A5%E3%81%A7%E3%81%8D%E3%81%BE%E3%81%9B%E3%82%93%E3%81%A7%E3%81%97%E3%81%9F%E3%80%82) "The system software is unrecognized." or "Valid system software not found."

However, my star language skills aren't particularly impressive, and I'm tired of staring at squiggles to transcribe them, so that's all I'm gonna do; maybe someone better than me can step in and finish it for you. =)

Hi,
thanks for reply. I've found the missing something: 検
After a bit of googling: 正規のシステムソフトウェアを検知できませんでした。本製品は、正規に提供されているシステムソフトウェアでなければ動作保障できません。

but google translate is a bit wooden...

//edit: it looks like this problem is caused by prometheus CW 5.50...
//edit2: Sooo, I used your contribution to search for "テイルズオブザワールド レディアントマイソロジ  正規のシステムソフトウェアを検知できませんでした" which gave me few japanese sites offering solution, but unfortunately they used megaupload which is down. So I was searching for "tales of the world  Radiant Mythology 3 prometheus patch -english" and found [this one](http://www-8nl.flashfly.net/forums/viewtopic.php?t=399140&p=5290321) which appears to be working. Thanks alot for your help
