- Post Title: I will pay for Atlantica Online items extracted

I will gladly pay someone ( PayPal?) if they can extract out the weapon and shield meshes AND dds files for me. They need to be in an 3dmax editable format.I am too busy with my game server to take this task on atm.

Seems it's Nif engine version 20.6
I don't think someone will start analysing nif models from scratch.

There's already a project
[http://niftools.sourceforge.net/wiki/NifSkope](http://niftools.sourceforge.net/wiki/NifSkope)
where everyone could contribute.

With version 1.0.22 you're getting this so far (upper part of pic):

So better make a contribution to "feed the world" (or something similar)  
and wait for the next version of NifSkope...

edit: just made a quickhack (lower part of upper pic) after viewing the nif in a hexeditor:

Some faces wrong, some submeshes missing (feet, tail) but should be possible.
But I'm not working for money here; it's just one of my hobbies.
(So far Atlantica models are not on my focus; this may change; don't know.)
