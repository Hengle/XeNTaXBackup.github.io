- Post Title: Asterix and Obelix XXL trilogy remastered

A few weeks ago I made a quick and dirty script for someone on discord to extract assets from these games. Just posting it here for preservation.



It apparently works on XXL1 and XXL3 models but breaks on some XXL2 models but don't expect me to update it, I'm not interested in these games myself. Some files have several models, make sure you go through them in Noesis if you can't find what you're looking for.
