- Post Title: Battle of Immortals : unknown MPQ archive

While training a bit on files, archives and stuff, I found on the "coming-soon" game "Battle of Immortals" some interesting stuff.
1st, I guess some may be interested by unpacking it, since the armors are simply gorgeous (Global graphics beeing pretty close to what could be Diablo 3)
2nd, while looking on the files, I found packed files with sqp extension. The header is clearly a mpq, with the x1A just near it.

I tried all the mpq tools I could find but nothing worked so far. So if anyone wanna have fun with it, I uploaded one of those file, coming from the chinese version of the game.
I also found files which are "asking" for some files inside those archives, it seems to be simple dds & tga on it. Didn't found any file calling for the model.sqp (including all the 3d stuff).

And yes, it's a diablo like in 2.5D
