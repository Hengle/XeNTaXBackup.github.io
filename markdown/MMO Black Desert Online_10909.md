supported
mesh + bones + weights
skips lod's
not yet supported
auto materials

Copy the bones into the same directory as the mesh files to get them to load.
Mesh is .pac
bone is .pab

No problem. Made a quick edit so you can load meshes without a bone file there.

You just need Noesis to use that script. It will open the .pab/pac files then you can export to whatever format you want.

Everything works. These models are really awesome.
Anyway, now we need to wait for check each animation. I bet this kind of thing to work will be hard since I tried to search for .paa converters and so on but no luck.

- Post Title: Re: MMO Black Desert Online

I've made some small modifications to the script chrrox presented, what was being processed as the Mesh Name was actually the texture file for the mesh (it has no extension type and no directory structure). I've also added a new variable: textureDirectory which represents a string of the location of the uncompressed .dds textures so that they can be loaded without moving them inside the directory of the .pac file (which given that the texture directory is about 2.5Gb is rather useful >.>). You'll need to change this where-ever these are on your system if you want it to work.
In line with this I've changed the mesh name to just be a standard Mesh_<index> (min 3 digits enforced with leading zeros)

A lot of the textures also have a naming scheme for their purpose so it's possible these are automatically used while only specifying one texture name (each texture semantic has it's own string appended to the texture name) 
Diffuse Texture: <texture_name>.dds
Normal Map: <texture_name>_n.dds
Specular: <texture_name>_sp.dds  (I think it's specular power but I haven't looked into it yet, given that it's Specular Power the _sp would make sense)
Ambient Occlusion: <texture_name>_ao.dds (seems to be used for only precomputed AO for hair)

I haven't really used Neosis (or Python tbh) much so I'm not sure of all the material API for setting these so I haven't played with it yet. My guess is that if any of the textures for a semantic exists it should be used. Maybe someone that knows more about Neosis could point me to an API reference I couldn't seem to find one.

Copy the bones into the same directory as the mesh files to get them to load.

looks the script unsupport  static mesh .pam format?? it should be easy.

Hi there.
Can I get 3D models (buildings, trrrains) from objects/*.pam?
[strike]Can anybody send me script for noises or explain how to open this files and get models?[/strike]

So, here is header

First 4 bytes are standart, next 2 bytes are version? 
At 0x10 is the count of dss...
What is else here for?

Next: 
Starts at 0x414 next 4 bytes is size on ARR1 and next 4 bytes is size of ARR2
Next starts array of dss, 256 bytes for each items.

And the part that I can't understend what to do with:
ARR1

So, each item is 28 bytes with FF FF FF FF ending.

ARR2

each item size is 2 bytes. I guess it's like coordinates?

Ca

Some of the newer *.pac models in BDO seem to be different enough that the script provided does not work. Alternately the quickbms extraction script is somehow failing.

Example (non-working):
[https://uploadfiles.io/5f913](https://uploadfiles.io/5f913) pww_00_ub_0088.pac
[https://uploadfiles.io/b9818](https://uploadfiles.io/b9818) pww_00_lb_0056.pac

Example of an earlier, working file:

to maintain compatibility with existing "parVer" while adding support for "parVer 515" i added this under line 30

```
        bs.seek(0x14, NOESEEK_ABS) 

```


and changed line 51 to this

```
elif parVer == 259 or parVer == 515:

I'm having troubles with this. When I try this patch Noesis complains about line 31 saying "IndentationError: unindent does not match any other outer indentation level" Perhaps it would be easier to post the full script with patch than to try and teach me, but either way help would be appreciated.

@ngovandang - You could use Noesis to export the models using fmt_Black_Desert_pab.py plugin.

First you need to compile the models in the 1_pc folder.
Using PAC_to_DAE_Converter_v3 from [https://www.undertow.club/threads/black ... ools.9197/](https://www.undertow.club/threads/black-desert-online-modding-tools.9197/)
The process I use is to copy/paste all the .pac files that make a full character, head, body, hair, armour etc. into a folder including the .pab.
Using the pac_to_dae.bat I convert all to .dae as explained on the site, then using the -m command [merge] I add the .dae to an existing .pac, so basically it builds up the .pac file into a full character.
Then the .pac file can be exported into .fbx from Noesis, which has the advantage over Blender 2.49 because it keeps the correct bone names.

Example: pac_to_dae.bat - Creates body .dae files
PACtool.exe -c pvw_00_nude_0001.pac bones/pvw_01.pab
PAUSE

Example: pac_to_dae.bat - Adds body lod0 to head.pac file
PACtool.exe -m pvw_00_nude_0001_mesh00_lod0.dae pvw_00_head_0001.pac bones/pvw_01.pab
PAUSE

Delete lod1 and lod2 using only lod0. You can check your progress by looking at your .pac file with Noesis.

Hopefully this is not too confusing  Just noticed that on a lot of the .pac files there is no skeleton/rig when viewing in Noesis. These will not work unless there is a fix?

After extracting the PAZ files with an updated blackdesert_v2.0.5.bms from undertow, none of the skeleton files are linked or appear within Noesis.

Using the PAC_to_DAE_Converter_v3 you can assign the skeleton to the .pac file but it has no function/weights.

The original Quickbms Black Desert (script 0.2.3) allows PVW, PNW, PBW and NPC characters to be converted in Noesis or compiled in Blender 2.49.

So, back to square one 

Will try the PAZ browser 1.4b to extract all files and see if that makes any difference? - Update: .pac files still have no bind/link to their skeleton .pab.

Solution to compile characters.

Copy & Paste the .pab file into all folders e.g: phw_01.pab - 2_phw_armor\9_upperbody - 10_lowerbody + Head, Hair and Nude folders etc.

Noesis: Tools\Batch Process
Folder Batch: Choose Folder e.g: 2_phw
Recursive: Tick the Box
Input Extension: pac  Output Extension: psk
Output Path: $inpath$\$inname$out.$outext$
Export.

3dsMax: ActorX Plugin .psk Importer
Import all parts needed to compile character of your choice as you would in Blender 2.49.

For the NPC's use Batch Process within Noesis
Input Extension: pac  Output Extension: fbx
Output Path: $inpath$\$inname$out.$outext$
Export.

You may get some errors while processing.

i was on holyday
…
well the bonestructure is there as the Animation is there but the meshes of PAR-Version 515 have no weights in them and have a bonecount of 0(and/or the link to the bones doest match)
so you cant link the Skeleton to the mesh…
the mesh is there but its only a static mesh

I edited the maxscript, it did not load .pam correctly in Max 2021 due to a syntax error in the declaration of a dictionary type.
Here is the edited version of the maxscript, only tested with Max 2021:

Edit 2020-12-11:
Found some additional bugs(spelling error) when loading parVer 1030, here is the updated script with bug fixes (also with UI):

Additional stuff added is handling of normal maps, specular maps, height/displacement maps and decal maps.
Standard material is changed to Physical Material.

Hey,

I work with 3ds Max 201264 Bit and i get this Error:

It’s Lynix’s script, so all credit to him.
I did some bug fixes and changes, but only tested on max 2021.
You should use the script I edited with max 2021, because I am not even sure Dictionary types were even introduced in Maxscript for the 2012 version of Max.
So your simplest solution would be to use the script with Max 2021, maybe a student version.

Yeah, some genius would know!  
Looks like there's only a minus at the wrong place (== two differences) in (all) the rotation matrices:
bone count/kf count (97.27 / 97, 28)

```
((0.9774166941642761, -0.0, -0.21127915382385254), 
(0.0, 1.0, -0.0), 
(0.21127915382385254, 0.0, 0.9774166941642761), 
(0.0, 0.0, 0.0))

(97, 28) blender
[0.977417, 0.000000, 0.211279](matrix [row 0])
[-0.000000, 1.000000, 0.000000](matrix [row 1])
[-0.211279, -0.000000, 0.977417](matrix [row 2])
```


(And the keyframe count is off by one, dunno why.)

I took a quick look at the script and there were a few things wrong.
First the quaternion needed to be transposed (i.e. transpose the associated rotation matrix) :

```
BoneQuat = NoeQuat( (bs.readHalfFloat(), bs.readHalfFloat(), bs.readHalfFloat(), bs.readHalfFloat()) ).transpose()
```


Then there was a problem with these lines :

```
	RotKeys.append(NoeKeyFramedValue(rotationkeyframe, BoneQuat * BoneLocalRotList[Parent]))#Not sure what this means
else:
	RotKeys.append(NoeKeyFramedValue(rotationkeyframe, BoneQuat))
```


According to your comment you were confused about what this step was for. These lines here are used to convert the quaternion from local space (relative to the parent) to model space (relative the model's origin/root), by accumulating the transforms along the bone hierarchy (assuming the bones are well ordered in this case). 
However in Noesis, contrary to the bones' transforms that are expected to be in model space, animation data is expected to be in local space, as this is what most games use. So instead you just need to give the transform as is :

```
RotKeys.append(NoeKeyFramedValue(rotationkeyframe, BoneQuat))
```

and

```
TrnKeys.append(NoeKeyFramedValue(positionkeyframe, BonePosition))
```


You also gave the timing data as frames whereas Noesis expects it as time. So I created a variable called framerate that I set at 30 (no clue what the actual anim framerate is, you'll be able to change it if it's not the correct value) and divided all your timings by it to get the value in seconds :

```
positionkeyframe = bs.readUShort()//33/framerate
```


Finally you set your animation to be at 1fps for some reason. I corrected it to use the framerate variable above :

```
anims.append(NoeKeyFramedAnim("BlackDesert anim", wholeBones, kfBones, framerate))
```

And set the Noesis preview to it too 

```
rapi.setPreviewOption("setAnimSpeed", str(framerate))
```


If you have several different framerates later and want to use the anim framerate instead of a global one, go to Tools->DataViewer->Persistent Settings->Other->"Always use anim framerate" and set it to 1.

Do all that and you should end up with something like this, not sure if this is perfect but at least it looks better

Script does not work with many enemies. For example when opening m0001_goblinmagician, I get the message

```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "D:\Utilites\_Extractors\Noesis\plugins\python\fmt_Black_Desert_paa.py", line 128, in BDLoadModel
    boneName = boneTable[str(boneHash1)]#name = boneNames[m] #load boneName based on bone's hash
KeyError: '3438973197'
```

    boneName = boneTable[str(boneHash1)]#name = boneNames[m] #load boneName based on bone's hash
KeyError: '3785025464'
---------------------------

This happens when there is no/not suiting *.pab file (contains skeleton/bonenames) in the folder where the *.paa resides.

("KeyError" means: wrong bone hash, afaics.)

Thankyou shakotay2 for reminding me about that procedure, all motions are functioning within Noesis.

Just tested Character+Motion, all seems to be working ok.

Maybe you are right.Most .pac have common structure.However, it seems that wing's model have a bit difference.As you can see from that pictures below.

Are the .pah files in effect/mesh actually model files?  Is there anyway to look at the models currently?  Thanks -- was looking for the ark canon in the sage effects -- maybe it's somewhere else in the file structure but haven't encountered it yet.  Would greatly appreciate any help with this.

Export .pac to format required.

Well, I downloaded steam Version last night since I have no Korean ID and checked that no issues with .pab exporting.
Which file from PAZ you cannot export.

 For *.pac model file, you just need to place the .pac file and its skeleton .pab file in the same folder.Then in Noesis, import .pac and it will load the skeleton at the same time.
For *.paa animation file, you MUST place its skeleton .pab file in the same folder, Or Noesis will give error.

Hi,

In principle,it is possible since .paa file structure is almost known to us.
However, I have no such experience to do so. As you can see, without so many "experts"' ' help, we can't fix this outdated script.

You could try to reverse this script. I think it should not be too complex. Hope your mondifed animation will work well in game.

fixed.This animation uses some bones that should be in "pdw" skeleton.
Now v5 version will ignore animation that which doesn't exist bone in current skeleton.
upload with 010 editor template for pab and paa file.

update 5.1:implement some logic of skipping special bone for pab

BTW,You may need to extract "core321.zip" to folder "noesis\plugins\python\core321.zip\" manually. Otherwise,Noesis may have "IOError: zipimport"

fixed.This animation uses some bones that should be in "pdw" skeleton.
Now v5 version will ignore animation that which doesn't exist bone in current skeleton.
upload with 010 editor template for pab and paa file.

update 5.1:implement some logic of skipping special bone for pab

First of all thank you guys for all the work you've done, the scripts have been working perfectly. I was wondering tho if it was possible to extract the root bone animation data from the paa files and the actual root bone from the skeleton it self since it seems to be assigning it to the pelvis bone directly rn and it messes up the animation when i try to add the root motion myself. The 249 blender script from the other thread seems to get the root bone right but the bone names are a mess and it still doesnt get the root data from the paa

V4: Handedness is swapped in Noesis. You guys now can export models and anims as is shown in the game directly from Noesis.

Hello, can this tool be exported in batch?

Any idea what this error is about? I can't preview any of the NPC female models in noesis. Is the plugin outdated?

no plan for this feature. Noesis itself should be able to do that.

I think I have fixed this in latest script, please try again:)
You probably used incorrect skeleton(.pab) file. In most cases, pab file should contain all bones used in pac file.

I'm sorry, what I want to ask is:
Using version "v5_1" can correctly decompress the PAC file.
However, it cannot be decompressed after using the latest version.

I noticed that in the old version, I could extract FBX files containing texture path information, but it seems like the new version doesn't include texture path information anymore. Is there something missing?

You can change line 137~139 into following code:

```
matName = textureDirectory + meshName + ".dds"
material.setTexture(matName)

```

Hi. 
So i think or i have a problem or im very stupid and i don't understand exactly how this is working.
So i tried to export m_0061 with animations and everything. I used Noesis, i used the last plugin, i exported everything in psk and psa and when i import them in 3D, it a total mess.
Is there a specific way to do it?
