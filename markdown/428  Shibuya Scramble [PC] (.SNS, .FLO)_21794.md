- Post Title: 428 : Shibuya Scramble [PC] (.SNS, .FLO)

Thanks to a QuickBMS script, I was able to extract the .wad files and see their content.

Most of the UI elements can be simply either edited inside a .json file or are just image files that need to be edited, but the game's script itself seems to be stocked inside three files that work together : to.sns , to.sns64 and to.flo

Could you guys lend me a hand with that ?

The PC folder containing them is named "script", and is available on mega : [https://mega.nz/#!I4UimQiY!jZFwnrpUi4zd ... GbfdF5i7qM](https://mega.nz/#!I4UimQiY!jZFwnrpUi4zdcpVWsMAF7wwRIqIj2biY5GbfdF5i7qM)


If you need more samples (perhaps for another version of the game, such as the PS3 one), just ask me. Thanks for the help in advance !
