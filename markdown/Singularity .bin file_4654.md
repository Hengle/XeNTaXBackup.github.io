Singularity runs in Unreal Engine 3, try to search this forum. Maybe it will help to you.
And that attached .bin file looks for me like a part for UE3 Editor, because there are text strings for it.

For that .bin file I used only hex editor, to look inside it. Text strings are probably in some other files. Most of games with UE3 has .UPK archives which contains texts, sounds, textures, etc.

Some tools for UPK files are

So I looked at game's files and that .xxx files are renamed .upk which contains sounds, maps, strings and so on. That's what you are looking for. And in this thread [viewtopic.php?f=10&t=4536&start=0&st=0&sk=t&sd=a](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=4536&start=0&st=0&sk=t&sd=a) AlphaTwentyThree posted a link to UPK extractor. 
So you can extract that .xxx files now. But I don't know how to edit extracted files.

Try use Hex Editor Neo ([http://www.hhdsoftware.com/Family/hex-editor.html](http://www.hhdsoftware.com/Family/hex-editor.html)) and set encoding to UNICODE (UTF-16)-See screen. And after editing set encoding back to ANSI-See screen.

set encoding to UNICODE (UTF-16)


set encoding back to ANSI

For Unreal games there is really only one tool to know about:

[http://www.gildor.org/en/projects/umodel](http://www.gildor.org/en/projects/umodel)

Extracts models and textures from just about every Unreal game in the last decade. Including Singularity.

can check the compatibility table for the full list of games it supports:
