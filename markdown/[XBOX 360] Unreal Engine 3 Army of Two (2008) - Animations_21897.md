- Post Title: [XBOX 360] Unreal Engine 3: Army of Two (2008) - Animations

Hello, Xentax!

I've been holding in on a question for a very long time. I kept looking around for ways to get the animations from Army of Two (2008) for either the PS3 or Xbox 360 (This version has been far more helpful). I managed to get Skeletal Meshes, Textures and Sounds, however I cannot import Static Meshes or Animations..

On Gildor's compatibility table, he specified that there isn't support for animations or static meshes, I was wondering if there's some way to get them?

P.S: I tried asking him for support on games such as Splinter Cell Chaos Theory, Double Agent (2nd version) and Gears of War Ultimate Edition (to no avail), so I'm pretty sure he won't add support for a game, especially one that is really underrated and is from 2008...


[Here ](https://mega.nz/#!wUhE0Q5a!m3BIdpdjKSs0kOpCYTWoStha276LVPnEUk28tMcu_Xk) are some sample files I uploaded for your viewing pleasure!

Thank you for your time!
