- Post Title: Unreal Engine map export tools

During a few last years I was adding map export for some UE3 & UE4 games. There are currently about 10 games supported, so i decided to make a thread for this. Note that map export in UE is complex task, so its not complete or fully proper export, each game has some supported/unsupported types of data, because all UE versions are different, plus each developer can modify the engine to their needs and add more custom types or modify existing ones.

Here's a list of previously released tools:

Injustice 2

Days Gone

Also there are tools attached here in this thread to support for the following games:

Would have been nice if we had tools to also export maps from Ghostbusters the Videogame.

I know, I didn't mean to specify it to be related to Unreal, I was just mentioning in general. That Firehouse is one of the most iconic things in existence and a lot of us fans would appreciate it even with money to have that map.

Bioshock isn't unreal engine 4.
The thread and tools are specific to unreal engine 4 games.
Any tool for any non-unreal game would probably be best left to its own thread.

Er I believe you're somewhat wrong, Bioshock 1 did use the unreal engine but I believe it was UE 1 or 2 and it was quite modified in some way. Infinite used 3.

But none of them use Unreal Engine 4, they're all Unreal Engine 3

I'm still interested in your approach, daemon1!
I'm not interested in brainstorming. You already have your own thread.
Please remove your messages from my thread, i created it to summarize info about all tools i made for UE, so it will all be in one place

Would also love to have MK11 map support, or even MKX or MK9 if possible. Full map extractions seem like a rare thing. Whatever you post tools for are appreciated daemon. Thanks for the games you've supported thus far.

This one, as all other UE4 maps, are better described in FF7 thread, here - [viewtopic.php?p=162674#p162674](https://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?p=162674#p162674)

Hello! I suggest joining the Unreal Engine modding Discord server and asking there, I believe I saw a map exporter being released there.

[https://discord.gg/zVvsE9mEEa](https://discord.gg/zVvsE9mEEa) Here's a link to it.
