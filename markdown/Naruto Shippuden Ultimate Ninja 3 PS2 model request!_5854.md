- Post Title: Naruto Shippuden Ultimate Ninja 3 PS2 model request!

Hey,
I would like to get a hold of the Tsunade and Temari character models from Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja 3. If anyone already has an idea of how to do this, any help (or already finished models) are welcome. Otherwise, I have the file structure of the game here:

Game Disc

Data.CVM
GF4.BIN
GF4C.BIN
GRF4.BIN
PLVOICE.AFS
RPGVOICE.AFS
SF1.BIN
SF1C.BIN
SNDDATA.BIN
Sound.AFS
STREAM.AFS

I am sure the models I need are somewhere in the DATA.CVM file- but I don't know what do do next. Any ideas?
Thanks,
DarkScion

just a renamed CVM to ISO.
use UltraISO(Magic iso) to extract the file.

Thanks for the help... I downloaded the program, but it said the file was an incorrect format. I tried changing it from CVM to ISO, but that didn't help either. I also tried a different program, which said the ISO contained no files or folders. Is there a program you know of that is designed specifically for CVMs? I have looked around some, but I can't find any.
Thanks,
DarkScion

I have searched all over the internet for an extractor for PS2 .cvm files. Does anyone know of any? I think this is the hardest part- the models themselves should be easier to work with. Please give me some help, I have spent days searching the internet for answers.

I guess that dataE.cvm(dataF.cvm) may be encrypted.

I think it is encrypted... That doesn't mean its a dead end project though... I have heard of people extracting them despite the encryption... I am told it involves hex editors, but I don't know how to use them. Any ideas?
