- Post Title: (NFS Carbon+) need help for extracting audio file from .tmx

Hi people,
All is in the title. As I said, I really would like to extract audio file from .tmx files, that contain engine sounds. there files are used In NFS Undercover, ProStreet, and Carbon. Only, no tools exist to do this.
I know that .tmx is a updated version of .abk and .gin, and the structure codec is pretty similar to .gin ^^

Any help is welcome !

PS : thanks to id-daemon to make a tool for extracting audio from .abk files, from NFS Undercover ! 

I uploaded somes samples, if needed at [https://drive.google.com/open?id=19U3l2 ... epqdPzwnFP](https://drive.google.com/open?id=19U3l2y0GIy6Pssr8NErxibepqdPzwnFP)
Thanks in advance !

a .tmx file contains two ginsu20 hexes (files). (it contains two ginsu20 (.gin) files for acceleration and decceleration.)
now you can extract them with hexeditor.

He/all of us know that, question is how do you get them out, its not easy to look for the right offset where they belong, more information is needed, you already stated what is already known.

I'm probably a few years late but someone made a tutorial on how to create custom tmx sound for Prostreet/Undercover.

Also a person called The_Unpunished is probably making a tmx tool with encoding and extracting it so it may take some time. He also made a gintool with id-daemon's source code EDIT(probably coded with Java): [https://github.com/TheUnpunished/gintool](https://github.com/TheUnpunished/gintool)

He also said that he extracted The Run's tmx with no errors and the tool is probably in more testing stage.
so yeah.

EDIT: (probably coded and also modified it with Java)
