- Post Title: Font.TFF -- require assistance

Hello there. I've been reading these forums for quite some time now, registered just now because that's the first time I couldn't find anything useful to resolve my problem.

A game I'm currently translating into Russian doesn't show the cyrillic characters, so I had to play around the font file. There are 2 fonts there, both have the .TFF extension and the 'TFF' header inside them. I couldn't open or even understand them no matter which tools I've used. 

I'm not even sure what type of 'font' this is: I'm quite certain it's not usual TTF or a simple vector image. Doesn't look like an archive either.

The .zip with both .tff files is attached. I look forward to any possible help regarding this issue. Thanks in advance.
