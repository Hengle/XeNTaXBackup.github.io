- Post Title: .Big extraction

Hey everyone,

I would like to extract some parts of a game map and after that put in on unity for some shader & script testing.
So the process I've been using for a while is:
-Rip the map with ninja ripper (Obtain the static parts of the map well placed and oriented)
-Rip the map with 3d ripper dx (I obtain a well ripped scene but not oriented and placed so i have to rotate, scale it and translate it until it match with the NR rip)

But I'am wondering if it is not possible to optimise the way to the objective with another process.  I've been thinking about extract the archive (.BIG) with quick BMS and then convert the files with FME viewer to a regular 3d model that i could import in unity.

I am a total noob with quick BMS and FME Viewer so, do you think that it could work?

It's from Harry Potter and the half-blood prince (PC).
There is several very old topics on this forum about this game but I've found no one usefull for my problem
