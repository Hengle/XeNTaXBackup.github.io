- Post Title: Brave Soul Doujin Game DAT files

Hello fine folks. I've got here some files that supposedly contain graphics for the game Brave Soul. Just mind you this is a hentai game in nature but, to me it is a very fun and very entertaining RPG firstly. I wish to extract the sprites from this game for use in my comics and perhaps being submitted to spriting websites.

In this RAR file there are two folders containing the DAT files from the game. I believe these to contain graphic data as well as game information.

Could someone figure out how to extract these properly?

Weird that you should bring this one up, buddy. I was looking at these before but found nothing. I was going to post her for them too but wasn't sure if they were uh...rule-breaking or not...
