JSC files from this game are not compressed or encrypted, so you don't need to search for key.
(You can tell it by looking at the file in hex editor - if you can see some strings, then JSC is probably NOT encrypted/compressed).

In this case they are compiled JavaScript bytecode files (by SpiderMonkey Engine).
For decompilation you can try this [https://github.com/irelance/jsc-decompile-mozjs-34](https://github.com/irelance/jsc-decompile-mozjs-34)
or this [https://github.com/takaaptech/cocos2d-jsc-decompiler](https://github.com/takaaptech/cocos2d-jsc-decompiler)

More info about the format here [http://wiki.xentax.com/index.php/Cocos2d_JSC](http://wiki.xentax.com/index.php/Cocos2d_JSC)

Well, as far as I know those are the only two SpiderMonkey decompilers available on the internet, so your options are limited.
You can try to setup linux as a virtual machine. Linux is FREE and also virtualbox is FREE - just use them. 

Check also tutorials I have shared on the wiki. They can explain step by step how to decompile correctly.
But they are in chineese, so you can use Google Chrome to translate them.
