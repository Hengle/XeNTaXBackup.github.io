Hey,

Good work on the list - it will be very helpful. However, I think you should add a "Games" field because many games use the same extension, but have a different format. For example, I have encountered about 30 different *.dat and *15 different *.pak and *.bin files - all with different structures and header ID tags.

If you want more items to go in the list, you can find some information at [http://gameextractor.sourceforge.net/pr ... chives.txt](http://gameextractor.sourceforge.net/program/archives.txt) - the header ID tags are written in the () brackets, i think you will be able to find them.

Also, you can check out the source code for Game Extractor ([http://www.sf.net/projects/gameextractor](http://www.sf.net/projects/gameextractor)) - each PluginXXX.java file is documented showing the headers, just scroll down each file until you see something like...
// 4 - Header (HEAD)
where once again the ID is in the brackets (in this case, the ID would be "HEAD"

Good luck! Thanks for making the list, it is very helpful!

Far out! Did you do that automatically? Or did you do it one by one??

Excellent!
