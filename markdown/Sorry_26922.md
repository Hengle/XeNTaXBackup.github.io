- Post Title: Sorry

Hello, I want to apologize, I produce too many topics, I admit that I am annoying, I am very sorry I will not do it again, they are right, instead of begging people to do what I need, I am the one who must learn it.
anyway shakotoday2 I think he is taking the time to make an obj2hex and I thank you very much someday I would like to help instead of asking.
