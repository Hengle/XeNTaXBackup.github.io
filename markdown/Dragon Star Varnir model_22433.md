You can expand it with gundam_breaker_3.bms. But the file you uploaded is a texture file. Models are not included.

Some time ago I made an unpacker for games on this engine, I completely forgot about it. Haven't tested it on other games with the same engine, but it will most likely work (will need to update the file list).

Usage is simple:

```
DSV.Unpacker CSH_FILE OUTPUT_DIRECTORY
```


Example:

```
DSV.Unpacker "E:\Games\Steam\SteamApps\common\Dragon Star Varnir\resource\masterWin64\GxArchivedTable001.csh" "D:\Unpacked"
```


Or you can use "DSV.Unpacker.All.Test.bat" - Don't forget to change directories to your own.

The unpacker extracts with real filenames otherwise leaves the name as a hash. Maybe someone will be interested.
