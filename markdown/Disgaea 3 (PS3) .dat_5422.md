No offence, but although you did provide enough information, you sound like you're ordering people to make you 'a simple unpacker', which generally doesn't help with getting people to help you =/.

Assuming NIS didn't change the format at random for this game, [this should work](http://www.propl.nl/javaprogs/NISUnpack.jar). (I made this almost 2 years ago for one of the Prinny games)
Use it with:

```
java -jar NISUnpack.jar -LE FILE1 FILE2 ...
```

Due to the way the PS3 reads numbers, you'll need to provide the -LE flag. (the first Prinny game for the PSP didn't need it)
