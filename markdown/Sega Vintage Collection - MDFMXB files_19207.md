- Post Title: Sega Vintage Collection - MDF/MXB files

So, I'm trying to get at the files included in the Sega Vintage Collections.  Specifically the ones from the Monster World collection.  Mainly because I wanted to get a closer look at the [overseas cart image](http://download.xbox.com/content/images/66acd000-77fe-1000-9115-d80258410b72/1033/screenlg13.jpg) that was used.  It's definitely not [the Japanese one](https://segaretro.org/images/5/59/Monster_World_IV_MD_JP_cart.jpg), it's something new.

They all end in .m but mention either mxb or mdf at the beginning of the file.  I've attached a .zip file with examples mxb and mdf files.  Neither of these contain rom files.  Just images and motion(?) files.   Any help would be fantastic    Thanks!
