- Post Title: The Sting\Der Clou 2!/  2001 WLD archive

Hello! 20 yeas ago I met with very interesting and amazing game created by NEO-JooWood Productions. Since that time I am a really fan of this game. Now I decide to use new technologies of neural network for improve textures, mesh models and add new persons in this game. But I see, that all resourses of this game packed in strange WLD arhive, which is not unpack by many of standart methods. I only can see, that many textures files inside this archive by using [https://filext.com/file-extension/WLD](https://filext.com/file-extension/WLD) and TextureFinder.v21, Crystal Tile 2, TileMolester 0.19. But this files was written in specifical byte code , and i can't change textures by more huge high quality, because this may diplace another files in archive with bytes. By what method or algorithm can I unpack the resources of this game to a readable format and pack them back for the game?

I want attached this archive, but it it weighs 88 MB. I attached this on GoogleDisk [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GVNSRx ... sp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GVNSRx3vb6FbEMFDrzadJQnlztqXbJxn/view?usp=sharing) 

I really hope for advice. Thanks!
