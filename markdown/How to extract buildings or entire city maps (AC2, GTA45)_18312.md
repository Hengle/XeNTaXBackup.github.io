- Post Title: How to extract buildings or entire city maps (AC2, GTA4/5)

Hi guys, I am trying to get the assets from various games, to mod them.

In particular I am looking at any building/city map I can find. The ones that looks best so far, seems to be the GTA ones and the Assassin's creed ones (in particular I like the Italian maps and buildings).

I did check around but seems that nobody that did rip them, is actually sharing the extracted models; so I am looking at how to do it myself. The objective is to get the buildings with textures, or even better, the whole map for a city, which I can use at least as blueprint to replicate it piece by piece.

The tools I found are ancient and used to run on W7 or earlier; so any help about what to use and how to do the whole process, would be really appreciated. I do own the Steam version of both AC2 and GTA games; not sure if that may be a problem. 
Thanks!
