Hello. I wrote a tool for this game and i want to share with you. 

Source code available!
You need python to run this!
Usage: <script.py> FILE.PAK
Maybe this tool supports other games created by WayForward. You should check it.

Enjoy

Yeah, i know these tools. I do not recommend JPEXS Free Flash Decompiler to anyone. Much better is Flash Decompiler Trillix.

And i wrote my tool just for fun 
But it should work properly in most cases in the same way as the paktools.
