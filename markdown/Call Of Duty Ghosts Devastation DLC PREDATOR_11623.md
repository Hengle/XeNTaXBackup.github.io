- Post Title: Call Of Duty: Ghosts Devastation DLC "PREDATOR"

hi, I been trying to get my hands on the DLC model of the Predator(the alien hunter from the movie predator, not the predator plane drones) from the ruins special event, I tried some of the tools and so far I only extracted some textures from the .pak file but (for what I can understand) the .FF files contains the models but each time I try to extract them I get this:


I know there's this lime thing that injects to the game but my GFx card is not compatible (GTS 250) so I don't have a way to use the method, or are there better ways to extract the .ff files (if any)???

thanks!
