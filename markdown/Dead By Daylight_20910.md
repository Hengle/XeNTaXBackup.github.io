Previously, I attempted to use Ninja Ripper to extract the models but was met with an error that would not allow me past the start screen (this, I'm aware, can be an issue with the extractor regarding online games) then I switched using UModel being that DBD is supported, however, while it did successfully allow me access to the files, both model and texture locations were all over the place-- Feng Min, for instance; I could not locate her default hair mesh and with her default torso, the texture for the exposed skin on her arms was obtusely triangulated. 

Has anyone had any success correctly extracting these models? I haven't been able to find many solutions.

Hi, after you extracted the files you need to find model and texture files with the same name. For example: Torso_01.psk will have torso_01_BC.png texture file and so on. Hope it helps.
