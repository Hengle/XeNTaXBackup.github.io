- Post Title: Twelvesky2 Animation (MOTION and .rra file extension)

I'm trying to use twelvesky2's animation files in other games. I've added samples below. How can I open and analyze them. I'm waiting for your help. Thank you.


rra extension example animation files:

Even if a script was written to import the animations, it will do you no good because you never supplied the necessary files in order to utilize them. Like what Zaramot said in the other thread, you need a skeleton so the model can be rigged. Only then will you be able to import animations.

Very thanks. Unfortunately, I couldn't find the bone files. Isn't it in the motion file? Do I have the chance to insert "MOTION" extentions files if I do the bones myself?

There are different files format in twelve sky 2 : .Sobject , .motion , .mobject  ( didn't find .rra files O.o )

I provide you some files : [http://www.mediafire.com/file/arcobmzw4 ... 2.rar/file](http://www.mediafire.com/file/arcobmzw46sri8b/twelve_sky_2.rar/file)

there is also a quickbms script in case you need it to open those files, useless since noesis can open sobject files ( looks like an archive of mesh)

Thank you. I can open some sobject files with noesis but not all of them. Quickbms gives error when converting "MOTION" file :
 
```
impossible to write 0xdc7cda78 bytes (total 0xdc7cda78)   Check your disk space or the script is wrong   
```
 or 
```
Error: memory allocation problem
```


Which client do you use ?

I use the client of this site [http://12sky2.mayngames.com/](http://12sky2.mayngames.com/)

I think every .motion file is an animation, we don't need to unpack them, by the way i tried the script on them and I got the same error.

Where did you find .rra extension?

When I first installed the game, I noticed that the *.rra extension files were converted to *.MOTION extention files. (I looked at the MOTION file folders in C: \ Mayn Games before the game was installed.)
