So a few days ago No Man's Sky (PC) was launched, and I wanted to check out the contents to see if there were clear signs of a multiplayer mode, since then this thread appeared:
[http://www.neogaf.com/forum/showthread.php?t=1263009](http://www.neogaf.com/forum/showthread.php?t=1263009)
And we got some news coverage   

What's Next
First of all I'll be going to Gamescom (trade visitor   ) to get some contacts for the game I'm lead programmer of: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXBGa5J9VbI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXBGa5J9VbI)
Then when I'm back (and possibly while I'm there, who knows) I'll be continuing to work on this, but not sure how much I can get done. Time will tell!

Of which tool? NMS-Extract is a command line tool, so you have to run it from a CMD window

The Extract tool, I've tried running it from the Cmd window by doing: Start c:\<filepath> Once i press enter the extractor opens for a brief second and closes. Nothing has changed in my NMS directory.
