- Post Title: Tekken Dark Resurrection PSP compression

Hi,

I've been trying to extract the opening cutscene from TDR for a long time but I don't think I have yet the hex-edit skills to understand this file format.



My guess is that the file is heavily encrypted but I have no idea what compression/encryption it uses.
Could somebody have a look at this please and... give me some clues ?

Here is [file_0](http://www.mediafire.com/?5hce40jfcze6p30) (16 Mb) extracted from TKPDATA0.BIN munge file

EDIT : I managed to dump a working *fragment* of .pmf movie using JPCSP option found in the configuration dialog : 'Extract media files to tmp folder'. Better than nothing, but now I need the rest !
