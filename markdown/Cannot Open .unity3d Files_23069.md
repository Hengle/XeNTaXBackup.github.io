- Post Title: Cannot Open .unity3d Files

I've tried to open some .unity3d files using the common programs like DevXUnity, DisUnity Or AssetStudiobut but all failed to open so want to know if it's possible to open them or should I give up.

1. What is the name of this game?
2. Can you give out a download link to one of the .unity3d files?
