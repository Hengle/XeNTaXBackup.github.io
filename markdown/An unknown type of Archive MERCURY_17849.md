- Post Title: An unknown type of Archive MERCURY

Hi, this file is from an android game called Cashman Casino, and there is an AssetsLibrary file in an unknown file type call MERCURY.
I have been checked with Notepad++, only audio can be found, but I can't find any image files around except their name 
Can anyone help me with this? To extract the image from the archive?
