- Post Title: .Lwo and .Md5mesh binarised models (Doom 3 BFG Edition).

Hi again.

I'm having troubles with the binarised model format Id used in Doom 3 BFG Edition.

Do someone knows how can I turn a .blwo/.bmd5mesh back to a regular and usable .lwo/.md5mesh?


I'll leave some samples here just in case:

.lwo/.blwo samples:

.md5mesh/.bmd5mesh samples:

I would greatly appreaciate any insight you can provide me about this, thank you!
