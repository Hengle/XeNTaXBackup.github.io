- Post Title: .OCT file (Cars Driven to Win)

Hello !  

We are trying to import Lightning McQueen into Unreal Engine 4 and are searching how to convert a .OCT or how to use it. I read that it is the bone file or animation file. Can someone help us please? Is the Disney Infinity Extractor could help us?

You have to hex edit the ibuf and vbuf together. Once you do that you can hex edit the file.
