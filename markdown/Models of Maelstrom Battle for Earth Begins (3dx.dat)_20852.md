- Post Title: Models of Maelstrom: Battle for Earth Begins (3dx.dat)

Hello there. There is a game that came out in 2007 by KDV Games called Maelstrom: Battle for Earth Begins. Archives with the models of this game can be opened with 7z, but models themselves use the format called 3dx.dat and I can't find an importer of this format for 3ds max. Could anyone help with it? If needed I can provide examples of models from this game.

Here are the examples:

hex2obj extracts only mesh or animations too? Is it possible to extract them?

There is no way to extract animations?
