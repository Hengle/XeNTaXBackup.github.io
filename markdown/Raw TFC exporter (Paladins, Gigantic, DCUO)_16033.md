- Post Title: Raw TFC exporter (Paladins, Gigantic, DCUO)

For games not fully supported by umodel, such as Paladins, Gigantic, DCUO, Rocket League.

Can work for many games, difference here is only in padding size for textures inside TFC archive. For unknown formats use the version that extracts most files.

p.s. good idea may be to introduce padding parameter  I'll think about it.

Could you contact the developer of Umodel and help him in analyzing the TFC structure of these games? Maybe he can improve his program. By the way, your program does not work very well and often crashes, unpacking part of the archive. Try to unite your efforts.

No its impossible. My program works very well, and it does what it should do. My tool is not supposed to correctly extract all textures, because it only takes raw dumps from TFC, and there's no information about texture sizes and formats.

If it crashes, it means you're running it with not supported game.

To summarize: we will not unite our efforts, because it makes no sense.

I used them with paladins archives and on each archive the program crashes.

Can this be implemented? To get the texture names for the specific champions when extracting? This would save people a lot of search time because it's indeed hard to find the right textures.

Hope it can,

Thanks

How would you use this with Paladins? Which tfc file should you export for the textures?

Is there any way?

What dependencies are needed to run RAW TFC Exporter?

I'm running a virtual Windows 7 operating system inside of VirtualBox in Linux. 

When dragging a TFC file onto the exe, I get the following error: 

```

Description:

Are there any runtimes/libraries I need to install before attempting to use this tool?

Alright, I think I fixed the error. 
I needed to install Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 Redistributable.

While using Raw TFC exporter, the majority of the TFC files I've found in DC Universe Online appear to extract without any issues.

I came across a TFC file called WORLD.TFC, and tried to extract it with Raw TFC exporter. 
It extracted a bunch of textures, but it also produced an error message:

```

Description:

```

Windows 7 64bit

WORLD.TFC 
- File Download: [https://www.sendspace.com/file/veo22y](https://www.sendspace.com/file/veo22y)

I looked at the extracted textures in XnView (image viewer), and some of the textures appear partially corrupted: [https://i.imgur.com/fkK9JBK.png](https://i.imgur.com/fkK9JBK.png)

I noticed the game also had WORLD1.TFC, WORLD2.TFC, ... up to WORLD96.TFC.

- If those TFC sequences are dependent on each other, am I supposed to drag and drop all of these at the same time on the Raw TFC export executable? 
- Am I supposed to extract them while all TFC files are in the same folder? 

While extracting, I've had each TFC file in their own independent folders so I can examine them one at a time and avoid consuming disk space unnecessarily.

In order for me to get all the relevant textures, my strategy was to view the DCUO character models in UModel first, and have UModel's console log tell me the TFC file name of the missing textures. 
Then use Raw TFC exporter to extract the relevant TFC files. 

The texture file I was looking for was supposed to be in WORLD.TFC, according to UModel, but I couldn't find it there. 
This makes me wonder if the single texture file is somehow obfuscated in with WORLD1-96.TFC files.

In regard to the crash and corrupt textures, I have a sample file above that you can test. 
Please let me know if you experience the same thing.

But as far as I understand the Texture is 2048x2048, the tools forces it to be 512x512. 

[https://i.imgur.com/fkK9JBK.png](https://i.imgur.com/fkK9JBK.png) --> [https://imgur.com/fegwA7j](https://imgur.com/fegwA7j)   I fixed the texture you were looking for.

This is not a bug. As I said before:

You can use it as it is, or manually fix textures. Or use another EXE (for example, gigantic) that will extract them differently based on different guess logic.

TSelman61 also offered to show me how to manually fix the 2048 res textures, so I will ask him about that. 

Thank you both for the help.

-EDIT-
In case people were wondering, the method that's being used here isn't something that UModel (UEViewer) can incorporate into it's programming:

Paladins seems to use a slightly weird format for some of its normals. It uses just pairs of bytes to represent the x, y components of the normals of each pixel as signed ints. But the tool expects them to be normal dds format with dxt1.

So I wrote a script that fixes them and outputs a correct normal map in tga format [https://pastebin.com/vG4k4U9V](https://pastebin.com/vG4k4U9V)

That's nice. But you're too late for that though because my friends and I already found anyone to fix the V8U8 Normals long time ago since Daeman1 refused to help and ignores our requests for new update for Paladins support last year. Custom TFC Softwares are best than Daemon1's. If you want to get it then you have to join my Discord Server to get it or dm/pm me for its.

Hi, we install this python script into which program? 
Is there anything we need to install prior to running this script?

Also, will this script work for other games as well?

Hey.
I'm going to make the announcement here since Some peoples forgot the Paladins Texture collection already existed, They didn't research or They don't know about it.

I just finished collecting all Champions' Textures in December 2020.

Paladins 3D Artist Discord Server:
[https://discord.com/invite/tUab8mg](https://discord.com/invite/tUab8mg)
Paladins 3D Asset Resource Collection (Updated: September 10, 2022) - I forgot to share the update a month here ago.
There's Model/Texture Collection Mega link in my Discord server. You will find it there.
Notes: Maps and other Models are in wip. But I have no time. Don't worry about it. I will add them in the future.

What's about Realm Royale Texture Collection & Smite Texture Collection?
I will do them in the future. But I have no plan to collect them.
I don't know when. Will do them though.

Rogue Company & Smite collections are in wip now.

Btw, Don't forget to follow me. I guess.
[https://twitter.com/M_MRL_Paladins](https://twitter.com/M_MRL_Paladins)

If you want to get Smite Textures then I will leave the Tutorial guide video that I made last year. I posted it in Discord Servers last year. People were able to get them because of me.

Does this tool support 4k textures? I extracted all tfcs and couldn't find any.
Also I'd like to see the source code.

No, Daemon1's TFC tool doesn't support 4k extracting.

I used my friend's custom tool that he made for me.

Magick.NET-Q16-AnyCPU.dll is required for the tool.

I wanted to share a Magick file. But it was too huge to upload.
I wanted to read the rules about the upload limit so I can split the file into parts. But I don't see it on the rules anywhere. Does anyone know what's the upload limit size?

The tool was made by Ayman a few years ago before he quit Paladins and mysteriously disappeared.

Yeah, Version 7.9.2 of Magick.NET-Q16-AnyCPU.dll got me to attempting to make a reference

Then it threw this error:

Considering the paladins_tfc.exe spit out something similar I think it might be a TFC issue now

'ue_tfc_oodle.bms' worked well enough to extract the raw textures but I have yet to find an easy way to "FOR Loop' a batch script with rawtex w/o PC crashing (otherwise it'll be manual drag/drop)

It's still working for me. I wanted to share "Magick.NET-Q16-AnyCPU.dll" file. but Website wouldn't let me post it here because It was too large file. 
"Hi-Rez TFC Tool" is not easy to explain. I don't know how to explain.
I always drag TFC files on "Hi-Rez TFC Tool Default & V8U8" to get textures.

And I have a huge news about Paladins and Hi-Rez Related Games. I will share news in few days later.
Using TFC Tools/Extracting is not needed anymore.

I forgot to share good news a month ago. I just got busy with my life.
My friend Yretenai made custom Umodel tool that will able to get Ultra-High Textures now. You can join my discord server to get it. It's in #Texture-Tools.
It's working with Paladins, Smite, and Royale Realm Reforged now.
