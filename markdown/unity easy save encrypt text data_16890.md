- Post Title: unity easy save encrypt text data

i used unityex to extracted text data.
some of the text files have been found to have been encrypt in ES2(easy save 2)

i found the password keys used to encrypt the encryption and found that the encryption method was AES 128, 
but i found something different from AES 128.

how can decrypt file and re-encrypt an encrypted file?
