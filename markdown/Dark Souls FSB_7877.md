Hi, well I unpacked with 3 different FSB splitters but the files do not want to play. If you are interested here is an example FSB that was extracted from the game disc [http://xis9.com/000014f1.fsb](http://xis9.com/000014f1.fsb)

they are normal pcm wav files, I have no problems to listen them after having extracted them with fsbext:

nice! It doesnt work here though. I get .xma files of the wavs and those dont work in VLC. ill convert them as it seems its some common xbox compressed wavs. thanks

*i tried but no luck. i get errors if i use xmaencode or towav or simply try to play the xma in vlc.

Dark Souls doesn't use XMA on 360 nor ATRAC on PS3. They both use standard PCM WAV inside FSB containers.

Extract the game's archive using Chrrox's script.

Then extract the WAV files from the FSBs by running them through toWAV.

Note: VLC can't play XMA, nothing can playback XMA at the moment.

You don't need to use FSBExt though.

The FSB's you get straight after using Chrrox's script convert just fine through toWAV.
