Is there any advice on how to rip sfxs from the metal gear games (PSX/PS2/possibly PSP as I doubt someone managed to rip sfxs from Guns of the Patriots).
thanks!

PSound works fine on them, alot of the psp ones use encryption (peacewalker) or zlib (portable ops) or nothing (acid series)
both the ps1 and ps2 ones work by just scaning with psound, without needing to zlib decode i believe.

If you need help with decoding portable ops, I'd be happy to show you how to do it. peace walker i never figured out.

I also own the pc versions of 1 e 2 (substance), would that require a different procedure?

I'd only use PSound if the game uses the Playstation midi format (psf). Otherwise, you can also get the music with my scripts: [viewtopic.php?f=13&t=4450](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=13&t=4450)

well, that is a LOT of QuickBMS scripts 
It's too bad I had a terrible experience with it and am more than unwilling to use it
