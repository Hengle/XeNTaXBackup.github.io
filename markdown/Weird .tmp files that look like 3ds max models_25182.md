- Post Title: Weird .tmp files that look like 3ds max models?

Hi,
I've been trying to modify the models of Naruto Shippuden Ultimate Ninja 5, and apparently the models are .max files divided into submeshes
The files have a .ccs extension but are actually .tmp files and textures are .bmp

I'm leaving the file so you can take a look, if you can, please let me know. I don't want work done, I would like you to help me achieve this
