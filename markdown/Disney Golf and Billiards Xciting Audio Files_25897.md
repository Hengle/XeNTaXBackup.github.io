- Post Title: Disney Golf and Billiards Xciting Audio Files

I've been trying for hours to find a way to configure the txth file. But it seems like PS2-CD games are really a special case... they both even seem to have the same structure in terms of files, like both of them having .irx or .cnf files, so I automatically assumed that I won't find anything there. However, CDDATA.PCK for Billiards Xciting and GREAT.IPK for Disney Golf seem very suspicious, as if I could find anything in there. But, like I mentioned, absolutely no luck. Now I am here, asking for help, since both Soundtracks are very underrated and difficult to find...
