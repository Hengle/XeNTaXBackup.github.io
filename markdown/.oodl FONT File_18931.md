This file is actually Oodle compressed data, the oodl extension and magic, and "KRKN" (Oodle Kraken) give it away. With the 16 byte header, you also have 2 ints, decompressed and compressed sizes, data can then be passed to Oodle for decompression.

I didn't really look at the raw data, it appears to have file names at the beginning, the data looked very much DDS so after removing them and generating a DXT5 header I got this:

Yeah can you please explain with a little detail how did you decompressed it? Which tools did u used?

Also can you extract that too please, [https://www9.zippyshare.com/v/POgrXPK1/file.html](https://www9.zippyshare.com/v/POgrXPK1/file.html)

To perform the Oodle decompression you need the DLL, which should be shipped with the game if it uses it. As for using it, I have a basic wrapper based off DTZxPorter's SirenLib here for C#:

His lib:

That file seems to contain different data, file names, small integers at the beginning, etc.

Here is a tool to decompress the files, just drag and drop them onto the exe, it can take multiple:

Thank you for compiled decompressor. Can you provide a compressor so i can make my own font?

By the way this exe creating .oodl.decompressed file, how can i turn it to a editable file? I tried to make it .dds but still can't view or edit it

You'll need to reverse the structure of the data, I can only take you so far. As for a compressor, you'll need to write one.
