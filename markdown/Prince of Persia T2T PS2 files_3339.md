- Post Title: Prince of Persia T2T: PS2 files

Hey,
so I ripped the  PS2 version of the TT successfully out with ''xpert''.

The Soundfiles are in compacted in several files: one (big) file in .ss1 format, another (big) file .ls1 and the rest (lower) files are sb1. 
Never heard of them before and don't know how to extract the files out of those, so have some cut files!

I put them in one archive because the file types are to different.

Hope someone can help.

It looks to me like all of the audio in the files you posted is either PS2 ADPCM or can be decoded by [DecUbiSnd](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=17&t=3156).
