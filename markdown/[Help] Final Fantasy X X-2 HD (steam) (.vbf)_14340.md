Hello,

is anyone can extract the files (and possibly repack) in vbf archives of Final Fantasy X-2 X remaster.

Thank you in advance.

(Sorry for my english> _ <)


Here is the file metamenu.vbf

Check this out:

[https://github.com/topher-au/VBFExtract](https://github.com/topher-au/VBFExtract)

Due to the way the files are stored, we need to know the filename before we can figure out which file is which, and the file list is woefully incomplete at this stage but it will grow with time.

I think I've found all the filenames, though. I just prepared them Notepad++, but I need to warn you that these files are LONG and cannot be read with an normal text editor, what with tons and tons of lines and all... but for now I'll just leave topher to do the work. I don`t want to spoil the effort.

If that's really true, you should upload that txt list somewhere. Even if it's that long, since it's just text, it must be less than a GB, so you could still upload the file for people to download.

What issue are you having with the app? You need to run it from the command line.

Good work! I've just embedded those files directly into the next version of the app and it auto-selects based on which VBF you are extracting.

topher, I need to report something with your tool. I was extracting the FFX2_Data.vbf archive with your tool, and it was running fine until it stopped at the "version_config/northamerica.txt", and gave me a error about "invalid characters". Can you look into this problem, please?

I believe those are event files that mainly contain scripts and text like dialogs etc..
Probably camera movements too.

how about giving the author time? 
I'm pretty sure he's thinking about implementing repacking.

I wonder if the game works without the ffx_ps2 folder because this folder contains a lot files thats been used in the PS2 version.

Game will not work without ffx_ps2 folder. It contains all dialogues, they are exactly the same as in the PS2 version.

As for repacking, files are compressed by standard DeflateStream. The problem for me is that in the original VBF, there are additional 4 bytes after every compressed file, and I don't know what is it. I hope Topher knows more about it.

I see it still contains the ps2 models and animations.

Here is a very simple VBF decompressor and packer. These are two separate console programs so you'll have to run them from the command prompt. Do not include any parameters to see the help screens.

If you notice any bugs, please let me know. Processing large archives takes a lot of time at the moment, so it's not ready for practical use yet. I expect the performance to be significantly improved in the next release.

Here is an example. Suppose you have an archive in "C:\Documents and Settings\Administrator\Desktop\archive.vbf" and you want to extract it into "C:\vbf-data", then you might run this command:

```
vbf-unpack "C:\Documents and Settings\Administrator\Desktop\archive.vbf" "C:\vbf-data"
```


After making some changes in C:\vbf-data, you'll probably want to put the archive back together:

```
vbf-pack "C:\Documents and Settings\Administrator\Desktop\archive.vbf" "C:\vbf-data" /o
```


Note the "/o" at the end -- it allows the packer to overwrite the existing "archive.vbf" with a new archive. If you're using this parameter, make sure you have a backup copy of the original file, because the old archive will be destroyed.

The unpacker and repacking works.

Neither Gimp nor Photoshop with DDS ext. works.

DDS.phyre aren't normal DDS files, they're .Phyre files that USED to be .DDS files.

There is a Noesis plugin that opens them, but it doesn't work with the X/X-2 collection.

I wish there was a way to view the field models from these games though, that'd be awesome.

Actually you can but you have to use Ninjaripper as well as plugin for Noasis to convert the bin but it works.
I ripped the starting sword of Tidus and imported it to Blender.

Oh, how did you manage to use NinjaRipper on FFX, because  I know when I point it at the exe it just doesn't work at all, because theres the first window and then it opens a new process right?

If yo could break it down a little that'd be great.

Just use Ninjaripper, point to the exe and make sure to use D3D11 wrapper and hit run.
Press F10 to any given time and that's it. 

I use Ninjaripper 1.1.4 for it.

Can you make the tool insert modified files and not just rebuild the whole file?

Modifying textures and having to rebuild the entire file with each modification takes a lot of time.
