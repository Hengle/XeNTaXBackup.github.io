- Post Title: [Help] Extract data from IVT files(International Volleyball)

Hello, I'm a volleyball fan and the last 3D indoor volleyball game that exists is "International Volleyball" from the Idoru s.r.l. company. The game uses .ivt archives to compress data such as graphics, fonts, and so on. I've been trying several extractors to open those files as I want to replace some textures to create new teams, but no success so far...

Can somebody help me to figure a way to extract the textures from those .ivt files ? Here is an .ivt file I'm trying to open (texture of a country flag).

Thank you !

No clue anyone ? It's my only way to update the teams... (the game is from 10 years ago so it's getting a bit outdated...). If you need other files to decrypt the code, tell me.
