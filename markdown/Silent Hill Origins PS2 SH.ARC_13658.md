If this is still important to you, I have a program that can help you.

I opened SH.ARC(version PSP, but I think the PS2 version is similar) using Noesis(Noesis version 4.177). The SH.ARC contains a lot of files, including language files.
Noesis.rar -> [https://files.fm/f/xryf8ffy](https://files.fm/f/xryf8ffy)

Unpacking the file isn’t a problem. Unfortunately, you can’t pack back to ARC.

I can unpack and pack ARC-file, but another method. For now I can’t write more.
Maybe someday I’ll write something more.

Also apologize for my english.
