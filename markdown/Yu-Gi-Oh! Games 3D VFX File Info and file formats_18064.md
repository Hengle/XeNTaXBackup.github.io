I will be using Blue-Eyes White Dragons files for examples

Models
The Duel Terminal Arcade Game has 749 3D Yu-Gi-Oh! Monster Models the format is (.model) a script called yugioh_duel.ms can import the meshes, uv's, and skeletons, but no skinning because the person who made the script couldn't arsed the files
so if any one can finds out away to import the meshes, uv's, skeletons, and skining, please let us know

Animations
Each Model has 6 Animations the format is (.anm)
Animation A is Summoning Animation 
Animation B is Standby in Attack Position Animation
Animation C is Standby in Defence Position Animation
Animation D is Attacking Animation
Animation E is Destroyed in Attack Position Animation
Animation F is Destroyed in Defence Position Animation

Textures
Each Model has 1-3 Textures format is (.dds)

Unknown Files
the unknown file formats are (.sk) (.tanm) (.texlist)
i believe the (.sk) mite be the skining but as the person who made the script said above he

Issues
Importing meshes, uv's, skeletons, skinning and animations
so the script that allows you to import the meshes, uv's, and skeletons, rename all the objects and it cant import the skin witch i believe is the SK File (.sk) and with out the correct names of the meshes and skeletons the meshes, skeletons, skinning will not effect each other and the animations will not work propoly 
and thats another problem the animations are a format ANM File (.anm) and there is nothing that can view them 

Monster Models Missing
the model numbers range from M_000-M_1078 and as i said above there are only 749 monster models so that means that 329 monster models are missing and these are the model numbers below that are missing these numbers mean 314 monster models are missing but since there are only 749 monster models and the model numbers range from M_000-M_1078 there are 329 missing models 
M162-M201
M265-M301
M366-M401
M462-M501
M565-M601
M661-M701
M745-M751
M769-M781
M792-M801
M864-M901
M976-M1001

Hello Guys can you help me, 
I'm a little new to the 3d, yet I was given the task of creating a small mansion for a demo of a game... 
the problem is that I'm not super stalled in real time... 
So I would like to know your experience and your methods for real-time decors... 
the goal is to create a manor inside / outside + garden... 
should we create the manor in one block? or the interior alone or each piece alone? 

thank you:)
