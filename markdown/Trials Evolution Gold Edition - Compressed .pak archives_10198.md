- Post Title: Trials Evolution Gold Edition - Compressed .pak archives?

The game is now in a beta stage and only those who have pre-ordered it have access.

The files are in .pak archives that seems compressed as I have looked with HEX editor (maybe zlib?). I guess only, I'm not completely sure.

I wish to try to translate the game and I need some of the texture/model files for one project for the game that I think to start working on.

The files where the text is stored is .xml, so I think that it's a regular .xml format. There must be not a problem to open them, but first they need to be extracted from the data_loc.pak archive and probably after that to be repacked in that  archive again.

For the texture files - they are in .tex format.

I don't know nothing for the models for now.

If someone wants to work on the archives, write me a PM.
