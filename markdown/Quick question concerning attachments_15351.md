- Post Title: Quick question concerning attachments

So I know that attachments be added to post and I know there is a rule about posting files that are the legal property of others. So just to verify, does that mean like the original files I extract from a game? What about files I converted to a different format and what if I want to provide a sample file for analysis?

Sorry for the noob question. I'm new here (Obviously) and I don't go on forums much, but this place seems really informative and a good place to ask help.

Just post away. The only thing we ask is make sure you don't deal in cracks, warez or pr0n.

Thanks! I have no interest in any of those nor have any intentions of posting any.
