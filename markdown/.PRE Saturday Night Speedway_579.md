- Post Title: *.PRE Saturday Night Speedway?

Hi,Just wondering if anyone would be able to have a look at the folowing file and maybe point me in the right direction, Everything seems pretty straight forward, but i just cant seem to get my head around writing a script to extract/import the contained files.

If someone could possibly take a look and help me out i would be quite happy to make a donation.   

[Car File](http://69.56.143.146/Downloads/Car.zip)

Thanks for your time.

I have taken a look at it, and the format is not too difficult, yet to complicated to do in MultiEx script. I could do it in a DLL plugin later.
