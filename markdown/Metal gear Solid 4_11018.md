Here is a 3ds Max script to import the models with Bones and weights.
No texture support.
Also extracts and de crypts all archives.
If it complains about a virus its a false positive and I can do nothing about it.
use at your own risk.

```
	mgsextract <input file> [output directory]

	Output directory is optional.
	Defaults to 'extract' directory within input file directory.

```


If you have problems I wrote this forever ago and do not remember much about the format.

I did not rite the file decryptor.

Thanks! Who made the mgsextract? I'd like to speak to them about mgo2 files.

Sorry to bump a dead thread but, will this work with the environment models too? Or is it only the characters with bones that're supported?

Stages are working too and they import fine and no need to place them correctly, the script imports them in order.

This is a Huge necro-post, but making a new post seemed like an even worse idea than temporarily reviving this, since its directly relevant.

I finally had time to check these models out again, but theres so many (and for some reason so many duplicates too).

IS anyone knowledgeable enough in maxscript to enable thos script to import multiple files at once. Theres over 1000 files per stage, sifting through them all takes forever, but selecting them in batches of 10 or 15 would speed it up a great deal and you'd quickly see if the thing you're after gets importer, after that its just narrowing it down.

I'm a maya user primarily so I'm not aware of how to go about this sort of thing in maxscript unfortunately, it might just be a limitation of the importer itself, not specifically the script.
