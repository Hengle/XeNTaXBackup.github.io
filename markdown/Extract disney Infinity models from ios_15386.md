Hi Guy's 

I'm trying to rip the disney infinity models, I'm very much a noob, but I think if I had access to the game at least I wouldn't need to be here. But I can't even get hold of the game, on the PC to rip the models myself, so I'm thinking, maybe this is possible with the i0s version somehow. Anyone have any ideas on that?

If not and someone is willing to help me, I just want a few models from Disney infinity 3.0
Luke Skywalker
Obi Wan
And Mostly Captain America 3.0

Please if anyone would be so kind.

I'm pretty sure it is, but like I mentioned unfortunately I can't get a copy of the PC version with the 3.0 characters. Has anyone already ripped these maybe and doesn't mind sharing.
