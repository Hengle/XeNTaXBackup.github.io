- Post Title: Strange Rouge warrior compressed audio.

Hey, so after exploring rouge warrior for a bit, I found most of the good stuff in new zlib'd asura resource files.  but the thing i can't figure out is what i'm doing wrong with these audio files i got from aluigi's bms script (after de-zlibing)  some play, others don't and only read as static.


Im hoping it's just some type of wav special adpcm (most of the playable ones are ima adpcm) i don't have a codec for, i doubt they'd develop their own audio scheme and only use it on half the files.

wow, silly me, it extracted with a few bytes at the beginning of those files.
