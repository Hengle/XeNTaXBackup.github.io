if it is wii, and just like it's predecessors. then the models just might be mdl0s aka brres. check this thread out [viewtopic.php?f=16&t=3636](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=3636)

if my assumptions were right on the mdl0 file and if you've thoroughly read that thread that i've specified, it'll help you. well anyhow, if you're too eager to find out that easily, you can get it via; 

a. game disc>
b. iso>
c. wii scrubber>
d. character files (you'll have to find the files your own, mostly they're abbreviated as CHR or whatnot)>
e. hexeditor (depending on the game model file, you have to edit the headers for it to be easily coverted to brres)>
f. brresviewer (just search our forum for kentillan brresviewer)>
g. convert to obj/fbx/dae/psk>
h. your 3d application


there are tons of ways on how to do the steps, just search the forum, backread threads.

ggodluck!

He already told you that you need to use WiiScrubber to extract files from the iso. Follow instructions before you wimp out.
