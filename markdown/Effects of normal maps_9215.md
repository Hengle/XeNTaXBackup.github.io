- Post Title: Effects of normal maps?

Can someone show me the difference between a model that has a normal map applied and a model that doesn't?
lol I don't know if noesis is actually doing anything with the normal texture map I'm telling it to set since I don't see any visual difference in the result.

normal maps essentially give the illusion of more detail on the surface of low polygon models, but they have no effect on the silhouette.
