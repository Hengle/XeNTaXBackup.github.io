- Post Title: 3 complete skateboards you should buy for you or your children

As you are reading this, I know that you are looking for the best complete skateboards, right? Yes, I'm here to help you do that. The skateboards introduced in this article will definitely not disappoint you. I want to remind you, if there's anything you want to ask about skateboards, tips, tricks, etc, you can go to SkateAdvisors - a skateboarding blog that I’ve been visiting for a long time. Alright! let’s not wait any longer.

Arbor Pilsner Cruiser

Personally, I feel this Arbor Pilsner right for me. The first time I rode it, wow! It was amazing, especially the trucks and bushings that are just perfect for carving. What I really like is its wheels. They are amber-colored and so match with the deck and trucks. The deck has a lot of concave so you can stand steadily on your board and easily do a lot of hard tricks. 

Bearings from complete skateboards are usually poor quality, but with this Arbor Pilsner, everything is different. The bearings are super quiet and fast. This design is suitable for cruising around and hopping a few curbs. 



Specific information:

7 Ply Canadian Maple with a Premium Palisander Wood Finish
Glass Re-Grit grip tape
ABEC 5 Bearings with Spacers
Wheels: 61mm/78A, 36mm contact patch
129mm Paris street trucks, top-mounted
1/8″ Hard Risers

Fireball Cruiser

If you are new to skateboarding, then this model is for you. It is relatively cheap but very quality. The board has 8.5” deck wide with a medium concave and a huge kicktail. If you buy this, you will have a lot of space to place your feet. 

At this price, you can hardly find a better cruiser than this one. It is quite stable and the parts are also very quality. There are plenty of better quality skateboards out there, but these are perfect for those on a limited budget.

Both pros and beginners can choose this board. The trucks are something you should pay attention to. At the beginning, you may feel it a little bit tight and hard to move. But don’t worry, because they allow you to adjust the tightness.

Fireball Cruiser has Fireball Tinder wheels with a wide contact patch making it a lot easier for you to find stability on the board to cruise or do some bacic ollies. The Dragon bearings are what really make the difference. 

If you are wondering which skateboard to choose, then don’t hesitate to hit the link and read through all the articles at SkateAdvisors.

Specific information:
Eight fast Fireball Dragon bearings
Four Fireball Tinder wheels 60mm 81A
Two 7.75″ Paris Street Trucks
Width: 8.5″. 
Length: 28.5″. 
Wheelbase: 14.6″

POSITIV Team

This setup is for light and kid riders. I don’t own one, but as I’ve read most of the reviews are from parents who bought this for their kids as a gift. What makes this setup good? First is the wheels. They are made of urethane with 99a  hardness which can deal with abuse on the street or in parks. The trucks can hold up well. 

If you are an adult skateboarder, I would not recommend this board. You should spend money on other skateboards like the two models above. But, this setup can be a great present for your kids on his/her birthday. View more details here:

7-ply maple wood deck
Bearings: Medium quality
Wheelbase: 14.375 inches
54mm/99a wheels
Truck Width: 7.625
Width: 8.0 inches
Length: 32.125 inches
Width: 37 millimeters

These three skateboard models are not the best but they are good for your budget. I used to own two of these three (except the third one), and I tested them by myself. And by the way, you can visit SkateAdvisors to read more reviews on different skateboard models.
