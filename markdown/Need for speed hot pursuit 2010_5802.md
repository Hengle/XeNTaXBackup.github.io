Hi Tosyk, I've tried your tool but it does not recognize a lot of files...do you have something more recent? Have you ever managed to export the world data?

Thanks!

It's not my tool. It tool created special for extracting and converting cars, so i don't know exactly can this tool extract/convert something else. Anyway i can find source of this tool and you can take a look closer on the format, because i have no abilities to do this myself.
