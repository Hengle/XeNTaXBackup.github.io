I made it. My fonts are changed, and are visible in game.  
But there are two more questions:

1. Is there some solution, if i want inject these fonts into .big file?
Raptor tools works great, but i don´t want use 1 GB file for download, if fonts are in few kB files.
Can somebody help me with installer?

2. I´m looking for somebody, who is able convert localization_table into .xml file.
I use now Raptor tool, but german affix table is impossible to read.
Please, this is very important for me.

Many thanks

Hi,
What's wrong with Raptor's tools? They worked for me well.

Yes, Raptor tools are excelent, but unfortunately there is maybe some error, because by transfering form localization_table to .xml from german big. file is export uncomplete with this note:

001\content\assets\localizationtable\loot_affix_table.localization_table
 I = 3
 Data stream position: 53


That is sad, because in this file is key for inventory translation.
