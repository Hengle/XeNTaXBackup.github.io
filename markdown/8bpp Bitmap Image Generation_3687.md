- Post Title: 8bpp Bitmap Image Generation

Anybody experienced with generating bitmap images able to take a look at my code, see if i've got the hand of it? The random image that I'm generating here seems to be okay, as do solid colours but now that I'm trying to copy a real image into there, it's not working.

I want to ensure that this is working 100% but as I'm new to writing bitmaps, I'm not really sure how to do that yet 

The code is here: [http://pastebin.com/m52044f17](http://pastebin.com/m52044f17) (one month expiry)
