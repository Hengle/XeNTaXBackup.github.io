- Post Title: shadow of war/mordor nazgul/orc models and textures

Hi guys.
Does anyone here have a pack of nazgul/orc models and textures from shadow of war/mordor games?

Ive been looking around and saw many posts about people extracting them with the tools, but none provided the files.
I would like to have them for a mod Im working in, personal use only.

Thanks in advance!
