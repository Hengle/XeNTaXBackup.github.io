- Post Title: [Final Fantasy Tactics: PSX] Battle Map editing via Ganesha

Greetings,

We currently have level editing tools to modify Battle and Event maps of Final Fantasy Tactics via a tool called Ganesha ([https://ffhacktics.com/smf/index.php?to ... #msg227994](https://ffhacktics.com/smf/index.php?topic=11483.msg227994#msg227994))

The source code can be found here: [https://gomtuu.org/fft/Ganesha/](https://gomtuu.org/fft/Ganesha/)

I was wondering if there were anyone knowledgeable enough in 3d software/programming to know if it's possible to do any of the following:
Add ability to export and import common file types (.FBX or .obj) used by other 3D programs
Add drag polygon tools instead of having to manually type in coordinates
   if this is implemented, snapping to vertices or grid snapping would be lovely
Edit vertices in 3D workspace instead of having to manually type in coordinates
With any one of these QoL updates to this program the Final Fantasy Tactic romhacking community would greatly benefit from easier Custom Map creation.

Thanks in advance for any knowledge sharing!
