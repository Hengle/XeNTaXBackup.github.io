It's quite a large archive to download. You could find smaller files, or if it's a huge archive just cut the first 30mb and upload that.

The pak files look encrypted. Probably the same encryption used across CryEngine based games. Just needs the unique decryption key.

The encryption key needs to be obtained. It's best someone else (experienced with how CryEngine encryption keys are loaded) assists you obtaining it.
