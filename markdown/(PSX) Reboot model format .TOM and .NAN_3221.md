- Post Title: (PSX) Reboot model format *.TOM and *.NAN

Here is the Megabyte model from the Playstation game Reboot complete with animation file (NAN), model file (TOM) and textures.

Can they be converted to a common format that is global? Not just 3D Studio Max but Maya and etc? If more are needed I can provide. I could even get screenshots if needed.
