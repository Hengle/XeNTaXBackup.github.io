Unfortunately no. I am novice in this, i only try to learn QBMS and file researching. I am can't find normal filetable in this format and he is not very good (Although maybe I'm not fully understood it). In that main.pak there are three type of files - text files, dds, and unknown type. For each one the script is slightly different, so i dont know how to write universal script for all files in all pak. I may try help you extract concrete files from concrete pak, but thats all   Or maybe more experienced users can help you

You Russian?

@Thief1987

If you can extract and repack texts from main.pak, is enough to me. I wanna only translate the game to my language (Brazilian Portuguese). Send me what you have if you can.

Thank you.

Well, I ever use english for translation, then, extract it if you can.
I've sent you the file via PM. Please take a look in there.

Thx.
