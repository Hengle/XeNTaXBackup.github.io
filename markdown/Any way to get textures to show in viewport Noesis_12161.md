- Post Title: Any way to get textures to show in viewport Noesis?

So I browse to my CounterStrike Source Model directory and load a MDL, but no textures ever show up on them nor export with the MDL. Do these textures have to be in the same directory as the MDL in order to show up in the viewport and also export with the model? If yes, is there a workaround to this, since this would be practically impossible the way CSS stores its models and textures for the game.
