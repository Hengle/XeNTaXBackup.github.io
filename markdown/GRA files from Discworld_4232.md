- Post Title: GRA files from Discworld

Hello,
I am a translator, and I am currently working on english-to-polish translation of Discworld adventure game.

The problem is, that polish alphabet contains special characters such as ą,ć,ę. i would like to add them to the game. I suppose the letters are in a DW.GRA file. I give you the link to it. [http://www.speedyshare.com/files/21463008/DW.GRA](http://www.speedyshare.com/files/21463008/DW.GRA)

I would really appreciate if you helped me open it.

Johnny

The [scummvm-projekt](http://www.scummvm.org/) is fully supporting the DW series, therefore it has the info about the gamefiles and engine. Here are some infos too: [http://rewiki.regengedanken.de/wiki/Tinsel_engine](http://rewiki.regengedanken.de/wiki/Tinsel_engine)

I cant come up with a de/recompression tool or something, sorry 

EDIT: btw. the link to the files you posted is down
