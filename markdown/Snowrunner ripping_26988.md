- Post Title: Snowrunner ripping

i've recently downloaded a mod for Snowrunner wich contains a truck that i wanted to edit, but the thing is that the files in the folder of the mod doesnt have any extensions and there is one file in .pak. After some research i found that the .pak files are encrypted. 
I wanted to know if it is possible to decrypt it or ripp models from it

Your best Chance would be to RIP IT with Ninja ripper from the Game, do your edits in 3d Software, and Bring it Back into the Game via the modding Tools.

Thats how i did it once....
