- Post Title: Sudeki rips?

Sudeki has long been my favourite western RPG since I was a kid, and I'd greatly appreciate it if someone could rip / rig some of the character models for XNALara / XPS.
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudeki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudeki)

As nice as every character's armour would be (they change as the character upgrades in the story), I'd be happy with just their starting outfits.
The game was originally on the Xbox classic and then on PC, but I currently have it on Steam; I can provide any relevant files as & when they're needed.

The only information I was able to find about files that might contain the 3D models is "fubi", "gex" and "baf" formats. There are some of these in the game folder.

Here is a list of the character models I'd specifically like:
>Ailish (starting armour)
>Alexine
>Ailish (final, fused with Alexine)
>Buki (starting armour)
>Nico
>Buki (final, fused with Nico)
>Yemi

But if you happen to have all the main character models, that would also be great [Image: icon_e_biggrin.gif]

Not automatically necessary but it would be nice if they had:
>Facial bones
>Individual toe & finger bones

Thanks so much in advance if you're able to help~

In case people are still looking for these models, lezisell has made some of them available for XPS:

I'm still looking for a rigged Nico character model:

I did find this recently:

It appears that the T-Posed model on the right is missing a UVMap while the model on the left has a ripped ingame pose with possibly incorrect scaling.
Any advice for an amateur Blender user who wants to prepare this model for rigging?
It's a free download that contains an obj model and a 3ds model.
