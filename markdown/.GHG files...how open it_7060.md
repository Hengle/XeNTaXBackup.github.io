- Post Title: .GHG files...how open it?

Hi,   


I want to get the models from the game "Lego Star Wars 3".
I unpacked the .DAT files, and everything is fine with them.

I read in this ( [viewtopic.php?f=10&t=4697&hilit=lego+star+wars&start=15](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=4697&hilit=lego+star+wars&start=15) ) thread that the mesh data is stored in .hgp or .ghg files. i found .ghg and no .hgp files so I think the mesh data is stored in the .ghg files.


My question is:

How can I open/unpack/extract/convert a .ghg file? 



I would be very thankful if I got an answer

P.S:Sorry if my english is bad, I am not english.

Post samples of your ghg files.

As far as I know the *nxg.ghg files are used in the pc-version of the games:

LEGO Harry Potter Years 1-4
LEGO Star Wars III
LEGO Pirates of the Caribbean

The files contain chunks in different versions. The data is stored in little 
endian. The most interesting chunk is the MESH chunk. It contains the
vertices and indices next to some additional stuff.

MESH chunks in Version 0x04, 0x05, 0x2e and 0x2f crossed my way.

Maybe this helps (MESH in version 2e) (I have no Idea how to share!?!):

```

    word          wIndices[dwIndices];

```


Sorry, time is up - I'll come back later...

That is more help than I expected, thank you!  

But could you explain me how to use these informations (or is it a Script?),please? Sorry, I am a complete idiot at these things...

It just describes the structure of each piece of data so you have some idea what's going on.
You typically use it as reference when going through the file cause there may be unknown information not captured explicitly.

In your case, it wouldn't apply directly as it is not the same version that is described, but it could be similar.

Immediately one notices that each chunk starts with some tag like "02UN", "OFNI", "HGXT", "SDNB", "HSEM", etc

And how can I use it to get the model?

Write a script. A fully laid out format is a matter of translating into some language.

On the other hand, here you only have clues. I guess all you're interested in is a tool and not so much the process leading up to the tool? lol

Yes, I would prefer to use an already wrote script. I don't even know how to write a script...

I'm sorry, but I have no skills in python (blender) nor do I own max. 

In whitch format do you need the meshes? What will you do with them?
There is much data in the files where I have no idea what it is used for.

This topic is really new to me. Maybe a more skilled or more experienced
person can write a script. I could provide an incomplete hsl-file for 
HexWorkshop, but I found no way to handle the #if and #else segments (like I 
have posted before) in a structure file.

If I find the time I'll try out blender...

That may take some time just to figure out how to draw stuff in blender, in addition to python scripting.

You can try [Sanae 3D](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=29&t=6932), which exports in MQO format (open with metasequoia, free software). Also in python, but everything is set up for you so all you need to do is fill in the parser method. The tutorial I included in the first post should give you an idea how to get something working.

It's designed so that you can directly translate the specs almost line-by-line, where simple data types are read from the file and structs are defined by methods.

for example, taking one of the structs you wrote

```
{
    char              ChunkID[4];
    dword             dwVersion;
    dword             dwCntParts;
    dword             dwCntVertexLists;
    struct VertexList2E sVertexList[dwCntVertexLists];
    dword             dwUnknown;
    dword             dwUnknown;
    dword             dwUnknown;
    struct Indices    sIndices;
    struct Part2E     sPart[dwCntParts];
};
```


would be translated as

```

	#definition of part2E struct
		
def vertexList2E(self, dwCntVertexLists):

  #definition of vertexList2E struct
		
def mesh2E(self):
	chunkID = self.inFile.read_char(4)				
	dwVersion = self.inFile.read_long()
	dwCntParts = self.inFile.read_long()
	dwCntVertexLists = self.inFile.read_long()
	self.vertexList2E(dwCntVertexLists)
	unk1 = self.inFile.read_long()
	unk2 = self.inFile.read_long()
	unk3 = self.inFile.read_long()
	self.indices()
	self.part2E(dwCntParts)

#main parser method
def parse_file(self):

	#stuff
	self.mesh2E() #parse mesh
	#more stuff

```


If I ever look at blender, I'll want to provide the same interface except add in some calls to blender's drawing methods so instead of exporting it would draw the model for you.

Will the script also work on .GHG files from Transformers The Game?
