- Post Title: .HCA - ERROR READING HEADER

I managed to extract from .awb getting these .hca/.neo files, none of which hca2wav works...?   

I've provided a sample, if anyone knows anything check it out.

Well, the good news is "alexfilth" from the hcs64 forum posted a temporary solution:

[https://www.dropbox.com/s/gv1abjxd52wu8 ... Player.exe](https://www.dropbox.com/s/gv1abjxd52wu8jg/CriAtomPlayer.exe)

It allows us to stream the .hca files, just drag them over the .exe, 
some may not work properly,and no decoder as of yet, but eventually we'll get there.

Update direct quote from "j_hk"

"Hello everyone. 
Here comes the latest SDK for CRI ADX2 LE. 
Unluckily I'm not good at reverse engineering. 
Maybe you guys could make use of it.

[https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/937 ... pc_v110.7z](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/93724095/cri_adx2le_sdk_pc_v110.7z)

Good news. 
This SDK contains C/C++ headers and a dll under x86. 
With these we may make further progress. "

UPDATE! Direct quote from "chungus"

"Hello everyone, my first post here. Just came to chime in about those .neo files.. 
I unpacked the dialogue .cpk files in the recently released EDF 2025 and found out that 
half of the voice files were in .hca format and other half in .neo format. 
As it turns out, the .neo is the same as .hca, but with 16 blank bytes added in the beginning. 
When I deleted the first line so that the file begins with HCA and renamed the file extension 
from .neo to .hca, it played in the cri atom player. Don't know if that's the case 
with the .neo files in other games but just so you know."

I confirm it works on the all the .neo files! As for extraction, 
that's still a mystery, for now I record from the player using 
Audacity and then convert it to a sample.
