- Post Title: Telerik Fiddler Help

Does anyone have a tutorial on how to use Telerik Fiddler so that I can extract the game data from the ios version of Tales of Crestoria? I’m having trouble using the Fiddler tool.

Describe your issue more precisely, tell us what exactly you are doing and in which step you are stuck and attach some samples/screenshots.

Also Fiddler is debugging tool and you're trying to use it as an extractor?

I was trying to get the game data from Pokémon HOME and Tales of Crestoria from the iOS versions and I heard that you can do that using Fiddler but I’m having trouble doing that. Any idea how that works?
