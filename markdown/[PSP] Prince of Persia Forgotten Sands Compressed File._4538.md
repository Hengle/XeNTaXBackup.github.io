- Post Title: [PSP] Prince of Persia Forgotten Sands Compressed File.

So, i'm trying to get the texts of this game.

The game uses a Bigfile called IFRIT_BIN_PSP.BIN (Which i've created a extractor to get acess to each file inside).

Inside of it there are a ton of files, all of'em using some weird compression that i couldn't recognize\crack.

It looks like this file uses an LZ\LZS but i could manage to uncompress this..

Can anyone help me with this compression?
This is the compressed file that i'm trying to uncompress : [http://www.2shared.com/file/jLWgDLux/IFRIT_BIN_PS5.html](http://www.2shared.com/file/jLWgDLux/IFRIT_BIN_PS5.html)
