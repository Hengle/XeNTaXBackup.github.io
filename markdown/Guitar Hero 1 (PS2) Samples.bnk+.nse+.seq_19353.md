- Post Title: Guitar Hero 1 (PS2) Samples*.bnk+*.nse+*.seq

Hi guys, I've just found out that not all music in GH1 is in VGS format & there're some jingles / SFX hidden inside files with NSE extension. Those banks are accompanied by files with the same name but different extension (BNK & SEQ); these small companions seem to store filenames and probably TOC / offsets required to extract numerous audio streams from *.nse archives.
BTW audio codec used in those NSEs is a pretty common one so that I don't expect any problems with playing those tracks after they're extracted.

I'd truly appreciate it if someone looked into them and possibly devised an unpacking solution (be it a BMS or some special tool / utility). [Samples are here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1y3ls1mhyyDcx0efFA_N9aSUIZEZ4uX6g).

Goodbye!
