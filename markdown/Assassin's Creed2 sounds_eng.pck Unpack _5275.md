- Post Title: Assassin's Creed2 sounds_eng.pck Unpack ?

[http://hcs64.com/vgm_ripping.html](http://hcs64.com/vgm_ripping.html)

Hello guys here I've read this site and tried like above URL.

In Assassin's Creed 2
"Assassin's Creed2_sounds_eng.pck" or "sounds_eng.pck" file might include sound and voice files, i guess.

[http://hcs64.com/vgm_ripping.html](http://hcs64.com/vgm_ripping.html)

Pop360XMA, Creed360Soundforge
ww2ogg
xma_parse

These exe files which are found in above URL can extract sound files or support that task. In spite of many tries, Results failed.

Do you know how to unpack?



And one more thing. 
Can sound files from "*.forge" format in Assassin's Creed 1 be ripped?
