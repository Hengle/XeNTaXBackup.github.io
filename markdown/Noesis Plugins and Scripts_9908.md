- Post Title: Noesis Plugins and Scripts

I've created a new SVN repository where chrrox, revelation, finale00, demonsangel, and I can put all of our Noesis script and plugin stuff. It has Python scripts and binary plugins. demonsangel, chrrox, and I have already started adding stuff. This is where you can get the latest versions of all of our stuff from now on. (the stuff that isn't included in the actual Noesis distributions, that is)

If you would like to be added as a plugin/script writer, send me a private message and point me to some of your work. Once the repository is a bit more full, I'll probably start occasionally packaging it up and adding snapshot distributions to the downloads section.

No one is using this. Could you guys please put your stuff up there? I would like it if only for my own reference/testing/fun. Please don't worry about putting incomplete or even broken things up, it's more there for us as developers than for users anyway.

I'm still in South Africa for the coming 2 months and I don't have access to my desktop or laptop.

With finale00's latest submission, we now have a total of 150 scripts/plugins on the repository, with plenty of additional example code and data. That's a lot of supported formats! I suggest having a look.
