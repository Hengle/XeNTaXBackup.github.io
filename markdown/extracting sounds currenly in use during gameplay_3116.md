- Post Title: extracting sounds currenly in use during gameplay

As some of you might know, there are programs, where a kind of screenshot is taken from the game and the progam extracts the mesh data of the curent world and the textures.
Is there a tool which is able to extract the currently used sounds as well? E.g. you are playing a game and the sound "kick_enemy.wav" is played, you do a screenshot and the program extracts that sund?

Sined there are some games like "Alone in the Dark 5", where you can't play the music or speech isolated from the rest in order to record it, it would be a nice feature

The point is that you can't separate all of the sounds that a playing at the same time (music, ambient sounds, etc)
