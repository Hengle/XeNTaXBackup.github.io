- Post Title: So many (disk) image formats...

Just downloaded an image and it had a .cdi extension.
Currently looking around for something that can mount it...Daemon isn't reading the contents. Maybe it's corrupt.

But seriously why are there so many formats? Why not just everyone stick with one format like ISO?

It's a PC game. But I will try that.

EDIT: tried alcohol 52% first and it loaded up. Lol daemon can't read it  
Looks like it was created using disc juggler. But really, why? PC game using a dreamcast format? That doesn't make sense to me at all.

it was just a popular ripping format for dreamcast games because that was the first program that could burn bootable backups for the dreamcast.
someone could use it to rip a pc game also.

MexCom should be able to handle disk image formats, since they're basically just a specialized archive format (or am I missing something here?)... Has anyone tried writing a MexScript for e.g. ISOs?
