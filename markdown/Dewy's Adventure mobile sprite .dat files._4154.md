- Post Title: Dewy's Adventure mobile sprite .dat files.

Hopefully this will be a quick one.
I recently extracted the files from a mobile game known as "Dewy's Adventure" which is based off a Wii game of the same name. I would like to extract the sprites from the files, and from looking at them they're in a simple .dat format, similar to a doujin game. I was hoping someone could give me the method with which to extract the graphic data from these files, and hopefully in doing so will be the same method of extracting information from the other files.

The download link below leads to a zip file containing folders holding the files with the data I desire. If someone could unpack these things for me somehow or inform me of the method by which to do so, please post her with said method and let me know.
