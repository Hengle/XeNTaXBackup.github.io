- Post Title: [Android] Disney Princess Majestic Quest

The game runs on Gameloft's in-house Jet Engine, but I am not sure if existing tools for Asphalt 9 and other Jet Engine games would work on character models and such.

The game can be downloaded here: [https://m.apkpure.com/disney-princess-m ... .GloftDPMF](https://m.apkpure.com/disney-princess-majestic-quest/com.gameloft.android.ANMP.GloftDPMF)

Oh and data.jet is merely a ZIP archive with a different extension lel.

The "piggy" engine perhaps. Use the Rival Wheels edition of A8Tool for pig/part convertion:

Characters seem to work fine. Scenes might have some issues with the transformations.

Just remember to rename .part ext to pig before using the tool. Textures are just ordinary pvr images, nothing big deal.
