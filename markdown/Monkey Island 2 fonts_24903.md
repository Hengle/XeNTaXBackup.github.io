- Post Title: Monkey Island 2 fonts

Hello.

I'd like to localize this game. I found BMS script to export game files but now I need to edit fonts. There is a font folder full of fonts.
For each font there is a .png image with characters and a file with .font extension.

[](https://imgbb.com/)

There used to be tools for this called ScummFont.exe by Hibernatus34 but it is very old tool and the author's website does not work anymore and I didn't find any other source.

Eventualy I downloaded it somewhere but it's just for Monkey Island 1 :/

I need to edit that file. Is there some tool for that?
Example file attached.

You mean file with *.font extension, right? If so, then you don't need to edit this.
It is only a list of font characters with some coordinates or similar data.

You really should focus on replacing chars in *.png file. You can do it in GIMP.

Yes, but I need to add characters in there.

Or atleast to edit these coordinates.

I could of course edit just the .png and place my characters over those I don't use in my alphabet and then replace these characters in text file to match the "unused" ones so it would show these "added" characters.

The game uses 2 fonts and different styles of these fonts and different sizes.
There is 97 different pngs. It would be very time consuming to manually replace each character in every image so I hoped there would be a way to edit coordinates so I could just edit it all with help of BMfont.

But alas I think there is not.
