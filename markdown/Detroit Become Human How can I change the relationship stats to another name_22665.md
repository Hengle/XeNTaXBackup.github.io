- Post Title: Detroit: Become Human: How can I change the relationship stats to another name?

I want to know how can I change the relationship stats to another name, I've seen some people doing this and I don't have any clue to it. Like that one: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53KDkXm ... e=youtu.be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53KDkXmcEf4&feature=youtu.be) - 6:20m // I asked the same question in Detroit Become Human Reddit and someone has tried to do it using visual studio then he said in the game's source is actually possible to change to another name but for some reason (I don't know what) it won't apply when playing. If someone has managed to do it and succeeded I'd really appreciate your help.
