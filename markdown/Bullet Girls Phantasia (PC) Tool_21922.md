- Post Title: Bullet Girls Phantasia (PC) Tool

I wasn't really interested in this game, but the format was too similar to Star Ocean. So I decided I might as well do a tool with small edits. It supports geometry/skeleton/skinning/animation. Tested with costumes and head models mainly, not sure about other stuff. Usage is similar to SOA tool.

3D Models

Tool overview



How to use
- Select the model file (.asf) you want to load.

- Select the animation file (.aaf) you want to load.
- Animate Position :  Will be unchecked by default. It is easier to preview the animations this way. You can check this before exporting if you need to have position keys in the animation.

- Export NEXS :  Exports the model in a custom format to be loaded in Noesis. Supports animations. Noesis import script : [Nexs Script](https://www.mediafire.com/file/exu7446rh5qzr64/fmt_Nexs.py/file)
- Export IQE :  Exports the model in IQE format. How to open/convert IQE: [http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?p=138153#p138153](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?p=138153#p138153) New script with secondary uv support : [http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?p=143565#p143565](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?p=143565#p143565)

Textures

Acewell's noesis script for .aif files was somewhat working. I just made slight changes and added new texture types.

Does the texture script support the faces as well? I can't seem to find the face textures, and a lot of textures are distorted so I wonder if any of them are in there...

I haven't checked everything, but if you couldn't find it in aif files, they might be embedded in asf. SOA was doing this as well. I will take a look.

I also didn't find the texture of the head, I suspect it is in the ASF file, but I can't extract the texture from ASF, I used SOA and TOC's texture export tool!

Do any one know where the texture for the head and body at.
