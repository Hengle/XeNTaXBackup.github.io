Hello, i am a "Pixel Animator 3D" user (it is an indie game on Xbox 360, there is no PC version) and i have a question for you people.

I like creating stuff in general, i am someone creative that is the reason why i liked PA3D and now i want to make some animations like short movie clips with it (or eventually another voxel animation tool on PC).
The thing is that i spent time making some models on my Xbox 360 (on PA3D), but i can't deny the fact that it's a pain to model with PA3D, plus it has few options, i wish there was more helpful thing in it, but i still like it because it is simple. 
So i would like to make models from my PC then making the "video" in PA3D on my Xbox 360 or at least export the models i created on Xbox 360 to use them on my PC.

So my question is: 
Is there a tool that could help me extract the 3d models from it and/or import converted models made on PC voxel editor ?

I Googled a bit and found nothing, the player community of that game is too small for people caring about that, so the question i really wait an answer for now is :

Could anyone make a tool to convert (and extract from the save file) the 3d models from that game ? And to convert and import files from PC to the Xbox game save ?

I don't think that it would be that hard to make that tool, but i am not a programer so i can't really say.

Thank you for any useful answer (even any answer )
