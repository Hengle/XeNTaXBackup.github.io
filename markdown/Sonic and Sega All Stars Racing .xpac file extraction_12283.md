- Post Title: Sonic and Sega All Stars Racing .xpac file extraction

I want to be able to extract the models from the game, but also rigged. The problem is that .xpac is a ridiculously encrypted format.    And I wonder if anyone can write a BMS script for extracting them. The file I'm talking about is "Racers.xpac", which is likely to have the 3D models of the characters. Does anyone know about this format?

I appreciate everything you do here.
