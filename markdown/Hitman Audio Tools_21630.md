- Post Title: Hitman Audio Tools

Dear Friends,

I decided to restart and improve my project regarding audio extraction in Hitman series installments. Currently I am working on a new version of the app, hopefully it will facilitate the process of getting the music from Hitman Absolution and new Hitman 2. It's still too early for me to say when I will finish it but I'm 100% positive it will be this year 

For now you may use v.1.1 from 2015 which deals with minor bugs and works with previous installments of game series. Thank you in advance for support and understanding.


The program runs on Windows system. It's pretty straightforward and easy to use. Good luck.

In case if you haven't notice, I left a message on your tumblr in 04/13/2019 chat stating that the link to your audio tool is dead so I decided to create to your current version of the tool just in case if it is lost.

Got a spare link or copy? This .zip file doesn't work at all; in fact I'm pretty sure it's not even a zip file. Tried to open it in 7-zip and windows, nada.

Open the .gif image, linked above, right click and save the image. Rename file extension "indeks.gif" to "indeks.7zip" not zip, 7zip, no spaces, then once downloaded right click and extract files to a folder. Need to have 7zip installed.
Holy guacamole, that worked, thanks!
