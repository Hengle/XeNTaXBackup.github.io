Blood & Truth tool.

Supports skeletal & static models. Textures are GNF, so no need to convert them.

Usage: drop .model file onto the tool, or run from command line with 1 parameter: model file name.
If .skeleton file will be present next to model, it will be converted with skeleton.
Rename generic skeleton to convert generic models.

This is awesome! Been meaning to get Colin Salmon's model from it to recreate his Robinson character from the Bond movies, thanks!!

Can someone share files maybe with me for the game? I dont have a PS4/PSVR system and its not online :/

I too would be interested in that Colin Salmon model! I loved him in that Resident Evil movie where he got chopped up into pieces from the lasers! Haha.

Lol that sucks, but I remember that scene. Shame he went out like that. I can't find any links to a fake pkg for this game so it doesn't seem like we'll be getting models from this game any time soon sadly.

When I go to drop the .model onto the tool, all I get is this:



Can I get some help here? Thanks.

Hey are you ever going to look into this issue? I've tested the tool out on other models and they work fine, Colin Salmon is the only model who does not export properly with a skeleton or mesh. Really disappointing, hoping this can be fixed still.

too bad you mention that only now. Your previous message looked ambiguous.
i already deleted game files some time ago. so i dont know if i will ever return to this.

Well my bad, I should have been more specific at the time but I figured a Blender screenshot showing missing geometry might have triggered even a further questioning at the very least. Well I guess it's over now, but if you ever find time to maybe download the files again to fix this I'd still be appreciated.

I'm getting screenshots with something missing every day, and most of the time it turns out that people did something wrong, or have broken files.
All of the models i tried worked fine, so i couldnt imagine this single one has a problem. Whats the file name btw?

Sorry for the late reply, it's "colin_salmon_bind.model" I've attached a zip file of the .model and .skeleton so you don't have to download the game again.

[https://ufile.io/y3jv9s4b](https://ufile.io/y3jv9s4b)

I tried once again to import the .ascii that the tool you made outputs and I still run into the same issue, a skeleton that is not binded and the body isn't properly imported. Please, I hope this can be fixed. It works on other models such as Klariza Klayton but Colin Salmon does not work.

you have to understand, that i can't drop all other tasks right now to look into this even after you sent me files.
also i'm VERY limited in time these days.
if i will ever have a chance to check this, i will let you know.
