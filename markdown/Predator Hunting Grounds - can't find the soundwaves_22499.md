- Post Title: Predator: Hunting Grounds - can't find the soundwaves

EDIT: Well, after some more searching I finally decided to install Epic Launcher (bleh), download Unreal Engine and use the official unpacking tool, and I've successfully obtained the .wem files and the name tables. Any idea why UModel didn't see the files at all? The WWise folders were empty in its browser.

I'm looking into getting the sounds from Predator: Hunting Grounds, but I'm unable to find any using UModel (set to load sound classes). I can only find things like AudioEvents, AudioBanks and other things from WWise, and the only SoundWaves I can find and extract are compilation success and failure notifications from the editor, but nothing from the game itself.
Is there something I'm missing? UModel is hopefully configured properly (again, it is set to load sound-related stuff), and I can access the game's models and textures without problem. All of the assets seem to be stored in one 12GB file, so no WWise .bnk or .pck files like in some other games.

May i ask what you are referring to when you speak of the "official unpacking tool"?
