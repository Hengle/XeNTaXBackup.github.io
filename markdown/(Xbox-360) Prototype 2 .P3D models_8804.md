Hello everyone!
I recently try to load models from NEW Prototype 2 game with Szkaradek123 great blender script. But with no luck! For some models it even loads bones and extract textures, but for most of them nothing. Could anyone if interested and can help take a look on them? Please, if you are interested send me a PM and I'll provide all samples. This game is very nice and have a lot of cool models. Thanks!

Is the script he wrote for prototype 2 or a previous game?

Hey!
Szkaradek wrote script for the first Prototype 2009. Developers seems don't change models format much, so with some models from second Prototype 2012 game old script almost works!

There are a lot of Prototype 2 models, which seems almost load with first Prototype blender script. But in the end only bones are loaded, bones names and structure are fine! Also extracted .dds textures not working, they have no header or something.

Hey!
Still trying  to load  models from Prototype 2 correctly, pity my skills are low for a such complex format. Now trying to load DDS textures extracted with a script. Can someone take a look at this single texture and tell what's wrong with it?

Sooo.... if any of you guys still use this site can you post up a converter for p3d files? It says the other post was removed and I need a converter for Prototype 2.

I was trying to add DXT1/DXT3 header for some textures, but I'm doing something wrong or simple something is missed. Can someone try to make this texture work somehow and tell what needs to be done?

My research on the prototype 2 format.

It imports the textured mesh for the model alex_boss (the only one I had time to test)

I've had no time to try and import bones/animations, perhaps something for the distant future or if someone else wants to take up this project.

Hi zaramot! I hope you will be willing to walk me through how you were able to get these models working.

I've installed the noesis plugin provided above by demonsangel and used the QuickBMS to extract many of the rcf files. I can find some p3d files in art/packages/missions that look like what I'm after, but I get a few different error messages when trying to load them in Noesis.

Can you tell me what extraction method you used on the rcf files and which rcf files need to be extracted? It seems not all rcf files will extract for me. Also, how did you access the textures? And finally, were there any other steps necessary to get the noesis plugin working?

Would screenshots of my Noesis error messages be helpful?

Thank you very much for your work on these models and many thanks to demonsangel as well!

Hi! 
To get Prototype 2 model, first of all you will need a PC version of the game (script wouldn't work with Xbox-360 version). Then you will need scarface extractor (BMS script) to get models from art.rcf (art.rcf contains all models you need). And finally, if you want to load p3d files into Noesis, you should extract textures from p3d file with blender script from Szkaradek123 (just run .blend file open P3D file with it and all textures should be in the same folder in .dds format), after that open them in Noesis and you should get this.
P.S It's a little tricky process, but p3d format it's a really nightmare! I can't imagine, how Demonsangel make models work, but he did it  !

I had no idea the blender script extracted the images, I'll look into it when I have the time, because if the images are in the model file itself it should be easier to implement that directly.

Post an image of the error anyways.

Yes, textures are inside of P3D file, I forgot to tell you about that, sorry. Here is an error message Demonsangel (if textures are not extracted with Blender script)

Thank you for your explanation. 

I need a little help with the .blend script still. When I try to run it, I get a python error. It stops on this line: "    Draw.PupBlock("dat files",block) "   So how do you open the p3d files exactly? Should it be alt+p, or something else?

I think, I know what is wrong! Szkaradek123 wrote scripts only for Blender version 2.49b so if you have newer version, probably importer wouldn't work. I've used script, which I already attached on the first page of the topic, but with Blender 2.49b!

I use 2.49b so it should be okay. Using alt+p gives you the option to open the p3d files?

Oh! I have to put the .blend file in the folder with the p3d and run it then. It doesn't work if you run the script from another location.

EDIT: After trying this method on the PC files, I've had limited success. I'm still getting these two errors quite frequently:
