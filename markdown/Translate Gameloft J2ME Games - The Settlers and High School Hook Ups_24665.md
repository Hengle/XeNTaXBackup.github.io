Hi, file format doesn't seem to be too complicated, I have created a wiki article to describe it [http://wiki.xentax.com/index.php/Gamelo ... uage_Files](http://wiki.xentax.com/index.php/Gameloft_Language_Files)
Some custom tool needs to be written to make such translation. Offset array on the end of each text block needs to be adjusted to prevent game from crashing. It can be done, but it requires some programming work.


By the way, I have checked android version of "The Settlers" as well and there all text files are just simple XMLs.
So MAYBE it's better to take care of android version, because more people will play it.
Noone really cares about J2ME games these days.
