Hello. In which format this texture file? I think that texture is uncompressed format like Alpha 8 bit, but this format doesn't compatible and it has 0x10 byte instead 0x43. Please, Write me about this texture format.

Batman: Telltale series. PC platform.

Can be exists alternative format to Alpha 8 bit? I think that texture like Alpha 8 bit, but Alpha 8 bit with 512x512 resolution have size 0x40000 but this - 0x20000.
