- Post Title: .raw files of Racjin games

There's a Racjin game I want to translate from Japanese (Fullmetal Alchemist 3: Kami o Tsugu Shoujo), so I've been investigating the CFC.DIG file, which contains most of the game's resources. This quickbms script can extract the files:

```
# script for QuickBMS http://quickbms.aluigi.org

get INFO_LIMIT asize
for i = 0
    savepos TMP
    if TMP u>= INFO_LIMIT
        break
    endif

    get OFFSET long
    get SIZE long
    get CHANS short
    get TYPE short
    get FREQ long
    math OFFSET * 0x800

    if SIZE != 0
        if i == 0
            math INFO_LIMIT = OFFSET
        endif

        string NAME p "%d/%08x_%d_%d.raw" TYPE i FREQ CHANS
        log NAME OFFSET SIZE
        math i + 1
    endif
next
```


I asked the script's creator and he said it was working correctly for this game, so everything is in the two extracted folders it creates.
The first folder has .raw files with the IECS header. They're audio, so I don't have use for them. But the second folder, which must contain the dialogue files and textures I'm after, has also .raw files but without an identified header. They're probably compressed and all of them begin with 00 05, like this one:


This seems to be the case with many Racjin games, like Naruto Uzumaki Chronicles and Bleach Blade Battle. I attach a couple of these .raw files as reference (there are plenty of them with varying sizes).
Does anyone know what these files might be? Is there any way to uncompress them?
Thanks.
