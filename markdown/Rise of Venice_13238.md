- Post Title: Rise of Venice

Hi! Maybe someone can help me.
This time I'm trying to edit Rise of Venice language files.
I used the Port Royale 3 unfuk ([viewtopic.php?f=10&t=8871](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=8871)) to unpack the en_data.fuk file.
Unlike in Port Royale 3 or Patrician IV, here I need to offzip the global.res file. (Thanks for the help for swuforce.)
After that  i used swuforce's global res extractor ([blog/?cat=532](http://forum.xentax.com/blog/?cat=532) - Thanks to him again!)
But i can't get the game to load the modified files.
I left the initial file (en_data.fuk) in the game folder. (Like i done with Port Royale 3 and Patrician IV)
Placed the newly edited global.res file into the %gamefolder%\ui\locale\enus folder.
I tried it with non compressed file and i tried to make a valid zlib compressed file but non of them made a change.
Maybe the game didn't work with non compressed files, and i can't make a valid zlib compressed file (i installed zlibc on ubuntu and used gzip, i don't know if i'm done it the right way or not)
Or the game didn't use the unfuked files! If this is the case, then it's a big problem. - I tried to make a random global.res file to see what happens if i place in Port Royale 3 - the game started without texts. But if i placed it into Rise of Venice, the game started without problems. So i think this cab be the problem.
Can someone help me to make it work?

Update: I found out that the fuk is only a header and managed to pak the global.res back to the fuk file.

Hi, I wish to translate this game too. I just didn't understand hunpatrik wrote, can you tell me how to open and close files simplier? Thank you.
