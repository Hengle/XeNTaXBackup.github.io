- Post Title: Dante's Inferno .viv

I've search all the internet for how unpack the BIGFILE0.VIV, which I only found two tools: the one for QuickBMS and the Rick's Visceral Games Tool (which I think it is this link):

[https://github.com/gibbed/Gibbed.Visceral](https://github.com/gibbed/Gibbed.Visceral)

I ask a friend for compile the github data, but it told me that it has many missing plugging.
And quickbms only unpack around 4000 .dat which for what I read, those .dat are the data compressed of the model.

So, Anyone know if I'm doing wrong or bad? Or if someone had a copy of Rick's Visceral Games Tools, because I cannot find it in anyway, just that of Gibbed.
