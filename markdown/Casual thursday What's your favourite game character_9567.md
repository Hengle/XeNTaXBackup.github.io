- Post Title: Casual thursday: What's your favourite game character?

I have many, being so old  , but I would go for at least :

1. Lo Wang (Shadow Warrior) 
2. Nerevarine (Morrowind, actually played by the gamer, but awesome story nonetheless)
3. Kane (C&C)
4. Max Payne (Max Payne series)
5. Duke Nukem (from Duke Nukem 3D).
