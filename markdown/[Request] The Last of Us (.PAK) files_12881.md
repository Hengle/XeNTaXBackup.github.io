- Post Title: [Request] The Last of Us (.PAK) files?

I don't want to be able to edit the models or textures, textures can be done, that I know.
I simply want to be able to rename the models inside the .pak so I can do model swaps.

I'm guessing since the textures listing can be found, probably the model listing can't be that much harder.
Again I'm only wanting to edit the file names inside, and not the models themselves. I know model editing is out of the question.

Here's an example of Joel's .pak:

```

I'd greatly appreciate if someone could make this happen.
