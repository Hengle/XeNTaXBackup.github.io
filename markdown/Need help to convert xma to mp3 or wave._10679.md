- Post Title: Need help to convert xma to mp3 or wave.

Hi all,

I've seen that one tool existed to convert xma to wav called ToWav but he doesn't work with xma's Injustice God among us Xbox 360 files.
Also the russian website seems to be dead.
So is there another way to convert this audio file type into wav file or MP3 file?

I've got a project, convert all voices clash battle into sounds playable.

THanks a lot for your help and sorry for my poor english.

You need to adjust the header of the files before ToWAV will convert it from XMA to WAV.

You will need the following:
[1. QuickBMS from Aluigi](http://aluigi.altervista.org/papers/quickbms.zip)
[2. AlphaTwentyThree's XMA Transform Script](http://forum.xentax.com/download/file.php?id=5968)
[3. XMA Parse from HCS](http://hcs64.com/files/xma_parse011.zip)

Download QuickBMS/XMA Transform script/XMA Parse and extract them into the same folder.

Run QuickBMS, select the XMA transform script, choose all of the files you wish to convert, choose where you want the XMAs to be placed.

The script will then run and manipulate the files and produce new XMA files that can be decoded with ToWAV.

Good news, vgmstream now supports XMA natively.

The test.exe included can decode XMA files to WAV without any issue.

Get it here
