- Post Title: Overlord 2

Hi. There was (2 years ago) topic about Overlord, but I do not want to make chaos.
Overlord main archive file is *.prp.
Here you have demo:
[http://www.gamershell.com/download_46870.shtml](http://www.gamershell.com/download_46870.shtml)
Here you have 7z with simple two files:
* snip *

It seems those files prp in game directory are with graphic but i am not sure.

I please about your help and experience about unpacking these archives.
Thank you
Soanvig

I have read that but I did not think that it is about simple files but about full games or something like that.

By the way: how can I get any help without publishing illegal files?

1. Check if the game has an official demo, or any fanmade mods that use the archive formats that you require decrypted. If so, link to it publically in the first post.

2. If no such items are available, put this in your post:

---------------------
I own the game, if you'd like to help me, contact me via:
myemail<at>domain.com
---------------------

Make sure you don't write your email in a way that allows the Google Bot to crawl it. Someone will contact ya.

@Mouse: see? I can be helpful at times, I ain't always an a-hole  Peace, people.

Okey it is done. It seems it is official demo. Same file is published on many many big software sites.

As far as I can tell they are the same format as the original Overlord and the 'Raising Hell' expansion, unfortunately that didn't get unraveled either...I'd really like to use the models to make images for a wiki, but no one seems interested in this project.
