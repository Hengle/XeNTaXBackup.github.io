- Post Title: Electronic Arts PS2 audio files

Hello, I'm trying to extract the music of Harry Potter: The chamber of secrect PS2.
I used dragon unpacker to unpack sound.big.
I got .sdt, .mus, .map, .mpf extensions.

I tried to change the extension of the mus files and I was able to play it but the speed is wrong. 
Any Idea?
Thanks.

You can just drop the .mus and .sdt files into Foobar and they will play with the vgmstream plugin.  Some of the .sdt files are also .big files themselves and can be extracted the same way as the .big file you already did.
