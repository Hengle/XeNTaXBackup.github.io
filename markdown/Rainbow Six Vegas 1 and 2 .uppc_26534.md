- Post Title: Rainbow Six: Vegas 1 and 2 *.uppc

I tried Gildor's Unreal Package Extractor/Decompressor and I got this error:

```
appMalloc: size=-658365916 (total=0 Mbytes) <- FArray::Empty: -770691709 x 12 <- FPackageFileSummary::Serialize3 <- FPackageFileSummary<<: Ver=241/66 <- UnPackage::UnPackage: RS5Weapons.uppc, ver=241/66, game=ue3 <- UnPackage::LoadPackage(info): RS5Weapons.uppc <- UnPackage::LoadPackage(name): C:\Users\PCPC\Desktop\hex2obj\r6v\RS5Weapons.uppc <- Main

```


Same error occurred for Rainbow Six: Vegas 2. Are there programs that can extract 3D models and other data from Rainbow Six: Vegas 1/2 *.uppc files?
