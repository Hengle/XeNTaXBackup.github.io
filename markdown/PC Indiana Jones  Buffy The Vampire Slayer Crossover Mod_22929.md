- Post Title: PC Indiana Jones / Buffy The Vampire Slayer Crossover Mod

Hi! I'm new here.

I've been following various threads on this topic.

Indiana Jones and the Emperor's Tomb and Buffy The Vampire Slayer (XBOX)
both games are based on Slayer engine.

But i assume that the whole idea of porting Buffy The Vampire Slayer (XBOX) to the PC has hit the wall.

So i had this idea of modding both games as much as possible, to create Buffy expierience on Indy's game.

Most stuff is the same in both games, main mechanics.
I know that even in the current state of progress, something interesting could be made out of it all.

But i'm a total amateur, and really not the computer wizard type ;P
and i need some help with modding some stuff. 

This is what i've made last week when i was messing with both games

Trailer 1

Trailer 2
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhQBnPK4Pb4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhQBnPK4Pb4)

Please, can anyone help me change things like HUD, Health bar textures, main menu font, and logo, swap sound effects for main character, both games are using the same file format. Remove cutscenes.

And i've seen mods on YT that completely changed enemy, and object placement, i need someone who can do that, or teach me how, so i can do it myself.

I'm new here, so don't get angry if this post is in the wrong section.

Cheers!

Hello, that's the good start on those trailers. Someone from this forum could probably help you a little with technical stuff,
but you need to provide some info first, like:
- what are those file formats
- what data they can contain
- where we can find some sample files (you can upload some on mega.nz, google drive etc. for us)
- did you look for some modding tools by yourself?

Main files - PAK format

Textures MTX format

Sound effects / voices are in RPE format.

Some modders on YT were able to alter levels, objects, and enemy placement, but no one is replying there to me so... 
Here i am.

People did a lot with those formats on ZenHAX  Buffy / Indiana Jones topics.

Buffy is a XBOX only game, from 2002

Indiana Jones is from 2003 PC, XBOX, and PS2

The same engine, many similarities, or even the same stuff used, in similar way.

Oh and i used solutions, and tools that were provided by other users on ZenHAX, and other forums, and as much as i could understand what i'm doing with those tools, i did some small progress, and i really appreciate their help, and big THANKS! to their hard work over the years, some topics regarding both games are on this forums aswell.
