I have converted some of the .fsb files into FSBExtractor:[https://i.imgur.com/Je4d3xE.png](https://i.imgur.com/Je4d3xE.png),
,when I already converted .xma, I put in foobar and i get this error [https://i.imgur.com/mCICSB4.png](https://i.imgur.com/mCICSB4.png) ,when I rename .xma to .wav and I also get that error (Missing ACM codec): [https://i.imgur.com/TcuGEpi.png](https://i.imgur.com/TcuGEpi.png)
here the file:[https://mega.nz/file/LJZyVZJY#NZ3w79M1u ... b0QKtTzXsA](https://mega.nz/file/LJZyVZJY#NZ3w79M1uRFIQeb2po32jRFV_oA_xu8ACb0QKtTzXsA)
