- Post Title: Star Wars Battlefront .SB and .TOC modification [Characters]

Hello all,

this is my first post here. I hope I didnt posted this in the wrong subforum.  

Have been looking for this forum where you mod games. You seem to be a great community which I appreciate.
My concern is I think no big. I want to change or replace the textures of certain skins in multiplayer. 
I thought that works over the characters .sb and .toc files. But I dont know how to do that...  

Probably it is not a complicated task for experienced users like you. Also I am convinced that it is possible, at least technically.   
So I hope that someone can help me. Dont know if you need more info.


Greetings

Well, actually, that is not easy. If you're lucky, and the texture is not compressed, this can be done after some work. But otherwise you're doomed. It would be possible too, but you have to find a person who'd be really personally interested in this game and modding it.

Oh finally an answer.    Thank you

Well I actually want to modify the files settings and not really add any new textures or extract them. Let's say I want that a skin is replaced by the Boba Fett skin in MP, just this. 
Battlefront isn't the only game which uses .sb and .toc files. I just want to define that the game use a Boba Fett skin instead of another. You know how it could be done? or anyone else too?

I told you that would be hard. sb & toc just means frostbyte engine, and its a hard one to mod. All games are different. There's no tools to mod Battlefront as far as I know.
