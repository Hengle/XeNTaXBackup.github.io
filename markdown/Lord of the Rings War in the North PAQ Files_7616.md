- Post Title: Lord of the Rings: War in the North PAQ Files

Any assistance in extracting War in the North's PAQ files would be much appreciated.  I've attached the smallest one I could find.  The game is published by Warner Bros. and developed by Snowblind Studios, and supposedly uses a modern version of the Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance engine.

Thanks!
