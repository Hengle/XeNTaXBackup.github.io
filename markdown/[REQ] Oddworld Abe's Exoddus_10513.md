Hi, guys 

Can someone look at *.OVL and *.LVL archives in Oddworld: Abe's Exoddus?
I will be very grateful if you could try to create a tool or quick bms script to unpack/repack this archives.

Each archive has a file names on the beginning.

Here are some screenshots :p

It's not very likely someone would start to create a tool, is it?
Though I liked Abe very much. But that's aeons ago, isn't it?

But now the good news: this work has been done. Google for Paul's LVLExtractor.

Its readme says:"This is a tool to extract files from abes oddysee and abes exodus writ[t]en by Paul M."

There's also a LVLBuilder in Abe odd_tools. Don't know where I found them nor did I ever test them.

It's really a shame.
