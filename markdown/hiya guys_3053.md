hello everyone, nice to meet you, i'm a new member and just wanted to greet everyone 
i didn't see a greeting topic so i just posted one here, hope you don't mind 
if you're wondering why i write "i" it's because i'm extremely lazy...enough not to keep the shift button pressed when i type the "i" key...oh well...that's just me...and i'm a lost cause so don't mind...
question
do you still accept multiex translations? 'cause the last post in that thread was written nearly a year ago...
i'm no programmer but it seems easy enough...is this forum only for programers though?
well the only reason i joined this forum is because i like to rip stuff from games...i really like it...for some weird reason i feel really happy when i rip stuff...call me a retard, i am one anyway...
i'm afraid i can't be here for much longer because i want to see something on tv that's about to start
bb for now
ps.
my keyboard is a bit...out of shape (that's my fault actually) so just ignore something like: myname isxrevenge
namely: the space key has some problems...
ps.2
check the pic, what do you think?
kinda crappy, huh? i know i can do better, i just don't feel like it...i told you, i'm a retard...

Welcome to XeNTaX, xrevenge! I can tell that you're not a programmer, if you were, you'd probably be much more concerned about capitalizing letters...  And you're perfectly fine, there's no requirement here of being a programmer.

Yes, we still accept MultiEx translations, is there any particular language you'd like to translate it into?

As for ripping stuff from games... I think that's probably why most of us are here, we really like doing it (or, in my case, I'm more drawn to the wiki).

yeah the only program i have ever written is a "Hello world!" in C++
i was wondering if you'd accept a greek translation of MEX
i don't know who'd use it because i doubt lots of other greeks know about MEX...
to me, a greek translation seems kinda worthless but i don't know about you guys...
so, bottom line, i can write a greek translation of MEX and any other program you want...if you want
and yes, i WILL write capital letters 
    o
E{(:-([D])]
    o
two more things about me, i like emoticons (as you can see) and i press enter every once in a while
because if i don't the page will just be dragged and dragged,
which is something i (and i believe lots more people) hate...and it's a pain for those with small resultions
see what a nice guy i am? [game refference, don't remember which game from though...]

edit:
why aren't the "o"s in the emoticon 5 spaces after the beginning of the line?
makes me sad...
E{(:-:([(|])] <--no ears for this guy

Won't I be needing special characters to do a Greek translation in MultiEx Commander? In any event, welcome, and yes, bring on that translation.  

About Capitalization Of Letters, Please Don't Overdo it And Use Every Opportunity To Capitalize A Word, NOR DO THE SHOUT THING SOME PEOPLE SEEM TO DO AS IF THEIR CAPS-LOCK HAS FROZEN TO THE KEYBOARD!

Oh aNd alSo AvoId Us1Ng H4XX0r TaLK TO SH0w OfF HoW 1337 YuO ARE. 

But comma's, end-of-sentence dots, and the occasional enter would certainly be preferred

ok I promise from now on I'll write properly (I guess)...
On topic, I believe you do need a greek font (links are the same colour as the background so I made the letters a bit bigger) to view greek letters...but then again, who'd choose to view the program in greek language if he isn't greek?   
When it's done I'll post it in the relevant topic.
Oh and you do not need to worry about caps or Ł337 5ρ34|< cause I hate'em too...
