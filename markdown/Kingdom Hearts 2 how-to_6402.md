I have KH2.IMG file from the Kingdom hearts 2 disc.
What can i use to extract it and what are the tools to convert the 3d models/textures?

Try the topic "Kingdom Hearts 1 models" on this forum for Falo's extractor, and search for yaz0r's most recent posts for the model viewer.

Or you could try Noesis with the Kh2 plugin. it works even for the majority of the Final Mix+ models I heard. but, unless I'm mistaken, it will not allow you to view animations, unlike the other model viewers.

Yeah, but I need to extract the 3d files first...

I couldn't find "Falo's extractor" anywhere, if its even what i need.
