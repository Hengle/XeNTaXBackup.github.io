- Post Title: Unknown subtitle file from Odin sphere PS2

Hi, I'm translating the PS2 game Odin sphere and I've already translated the texts for the menus, items and so on.
but I'm having trouble translating the cutscenes.
Although the files have the extension ".TXT"
they don't have any readable text.
Can anyone tell me if these files are compressed or something?

Apparently it has a similar data structure to the textures in the game.
