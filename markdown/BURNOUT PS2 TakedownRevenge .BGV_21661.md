Ok, I retry to remake the topic, hoping to not create a mess like the other one.

SO

Yes, I want to know if is possible to open this blessed Burnout 3 Takedown and Revenge's .BGV files, both from PS2.

I only understand 2 things (from Discord server): the files are not encrypted... and someone is testing for a PS2 script for Noesis

Little update... I heard from someone on Reddit that was a tool that can open the .bgv files, but he dosen't tell me the tool's name... he only tells me only that is impossible to find now.
SO
Someone heard/knows about this tool too?

Yes... like it's not a month that I knocked my head on Google, nah...  
However

1: I know, 'cause I am who start the topic on Gamesmodel.ru and no, they are simple ISO extractors. and I ask about atool for .bgf meshes extractor.
2: I tried this script, but we are on the famous points: UV Missing and meshes all compressed into a single one. If there is a way to modify this script and correct these missings, willingly, tell me how to do it.

3: which solution? I don't understand...

In that chase, Google solved me no problems  

PEACE

They already have models there man 


Plus you See the settings here for model researcher (little Indian, float xyz, etc.)

You now "only" need to find the vertecies/faces  startadresses for your specific models   

I also Found the origin of that burnoutbgvto3ds script:

Link + File are still accessible via Wayback machine.

There are even mods for the game...

Yes, I know.

I tried EVERYTHING of that you and the Internet offers to me, but nothing works 

about the ModelResearcher method, how I find the start address? and how many verticles count??? That's the main problem for me.

Is not so simple how it looks.

Well you have rdtechladys ps2 screenprint method:
1. Models: https://youtu.be/oYuHGlm0xKs
2. Textures: https://youtu.be/iHlJ3qO4lys

Heres a tutorial for model researcher:
[http://mr.game-viewer.org/tutorial.php](http://mr.game-viewer.org/tutorial.php)

It don't be an easy task though if you have never Done it.
Shakotay2 helped me with a tool that he created. It basically Scans files for These values. However he has to look into the file first for adding parameters and stuff to his tool.
Check it out here:

Yes, but I've got a huge problem with this method: the meshes are flat as sheets.

Strange, shakotay2 and another one has confused me a lot, instead (try to read this topic that I star here: [viewtopic.php?f=16&t=21595](https://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=21595)). About this topic, I precise that I get confused also by myself, becasue, from many Car1.bgv files that I have, I work with the xbox instead of xbox 360's one... and I apologize for it in the topic...

Yeah I can see that^^
The thing is that there is no uniform way to rip every model from every game....the closest would be model researcher or hex2obj, since you can set parameters and read 3d-info from files.
Shakotay2 and Bigchillghost where researching these (or some of them) parameters for you. The most important info I think was to decompress the .bgv into one single .bgvd file. I saw that you got confused there aswell...
Imagine this:
You have a song that you want to share with a friend. So you zip the .wav file and compress it to save disc space. Now your friend has to decompress the .zip or .rar file to get his hands on the .wav file.
Bigchillghost wanted you to do the same thing with .bgv files. he just came up with the name .bgvd to indicate that this file is now decompressed.

Ok, I understand that the .bgv file needs to be decompress, but I don't undesrstand how Bigchillghost "transformed" the .bgv file into .bgvd; i mean, also me have renamed the .bgv file into .bgvd, but, obviously, the .bgvd file is the same that the .bgv.
SO
I have to rename the .dat file .bgvd? 

And there isn't a tool nowadays that decompress the .bgv files... or I am wrong?

Don`t rename the file!
You have to use a program to decompress it.....its gonna have the same name.....this is why bigchillghost renamed it after the decompression process.
Look it up or ask him how to do it

I haven't got a 00000002.dat 
the files stars with 0000cad0.dat 

And... how I understand where are the mesh? (yes, I'm not very into hex...  )

because

I tried to open the 0000cad0.dat file with Hex Editor Neo and give me this:read the tutorial (tut button in hex2obj). Try to understand how to find the mesh in 00000002.dat (If you did we can talk again.)

Idk ANYTHING on programming and hex editor and who is the one that's has been left behind becasue doesn't know anything about it? me.

> I'm sorry, but I noticed now that I worked until now with the Xbox file instead of 360's one (despite I give to you the right file) ... I am stupid, sorry again
Who is the one that's excuses himself to YOU and Bigchillghost, admitting his errors and nobody talks again with a "don't worry, I explain to you where you get wrong"? ME.

Who is that's is a month that's is behind this .bgv files and nobody wants to helps? ME.

Who is the one that's search on ALL INTERNET about this blessed .bgv files? ME.

SO

I am the one's thats should be angry, not YOU, shakotay2.

Yes, I understand, but there aren't any tools that's do this. It was time ago, but now is impossible to find... (I asket to a person on Reddit that's said this to me, but he dosen't wants to tell me the name, idk why).

At least that's you tell me that's is the .dat file decompressed from Burnout Revenge Xbox 360... but for 3 Takedown how I do this? I mean, for ps2 and xbox, they are many .dat files and other strange extentions...

Sorry for the outburst, but I am here only for hobby, I am self-taught, so many things I don't understand... and about these .bgv files, I'm only desperate; I only wants to know to to extract they're mesh, explanation step by step. Really, I'm not here for argue against nobody.

Using offzip on Car1A.bgv works, as simple as that. It creates a 00000002.dat with a size of 6.232.032 bytes.
From that you'd get a mesh using hex2obj as I wrote (again the link):

How should I know that you used "Xbox file instead of 360's"? 

Instead of reading and doing what I supposed your blaming me on and on. So what?

I assume you're very young? Then take my advice not to blame people who are trying to help.
(If not then not. I don't care, sorry.)
