- Post Title: Black Ops .wav

Hello all. I'm interest in 1 thing: Black Ops .wav sounds, which located in fast file. (not IWD).

I wrote an easy [tutorial](http://wiki.modsrepository.com/index.php/Call_of_Duty_4:_Ripping_sounds) about how to rip sounds from fast files in CoD4 and MW2, but I confused about BO. When you get sound it is just .. noise. No idea why and what happend that's why I come here.


I would be happy if someone would tell me: is that posible get it?
