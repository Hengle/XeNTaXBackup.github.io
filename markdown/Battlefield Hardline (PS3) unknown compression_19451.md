- Post Title: Battlefield Hardline (PS3) unknown compression

Hi, I'm not too experienced with this so that any help will be greatly appreciated!
Long story short: this BF game has both compressed & uncompressed files stored within *.SB/*.TOC pairs and it makes extraction pretty difficult. Almost every single SB archive contains at least 1 such file and the 1st occurrence of it immediately crashes an extractor with this report: "Exception: Unknown compression type 0x02 at OFFSET in NAME.sb".

These are screens of select archives, I highlighted offsets where troublesome compressed files are supposed to start - [CommonChunks.sb](https://mega.nz/#!JElCjaLC!semdzkYKn1GmCJp1CutyGHTgK_1gfWC8YJ0r6ktVjWA), [FrontEndChunks.sb](https://mega.nz/#!VB1i2CRJ!vKErVnGcgEI3UVEjFnI3wBFMcGZVyVTL9im2nJaxIJM), [PrologueChunks.sb](https://mega.nz/#!gE8wiCaZ!JRYhzwChoLIGZX5glO906zvvASzh_EGQyhPlh5YsIIs).

Best regards!
