Good job Yoti, congratulations to contribute.
Question you think of making a script for other games too?

Some real tools.
Copy GR.ARC and unpack.exe/repack.exe to the same folder. Run unpack.exe, wait for "Done" message. Press Enter to close window. Now you will see all files from game archive + GR.TXT needed for repack. Mod any file as you want. Also you may delete from/add to using GR.TXT. No new empty lines, do not touch latest empty one. After all run repack.exe, wait for "Done" message. You will get new file - OB.ARC. Rename it to GR.ARC and revert back to game ISO (using UMDGen for example).

Now with grpack - that tool doesn't need any GR.TXT file for packing. Fully automated work with directory with files.
