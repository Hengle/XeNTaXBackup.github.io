- Post Title: [PS2] Death by Degrees - DATAUS.D, DATAUS.I files

Hi all,

I have attached link to archive with 2 files from PS2 Game Death by Degrees. The DATAUS.D file is what the name says an archive. Another fileDATAUS.I stored in the same directory, seems to be an File Allocation Table file. Can anyone help me and create BMS script for this game?
