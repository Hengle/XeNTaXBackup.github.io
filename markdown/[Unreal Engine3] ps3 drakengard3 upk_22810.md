- Post Title: [Unreal Engine3] ps3 drakengard3 upk

Hello

Can I get help decompressing the upk file from the Drakenguard3 file?

If possible, both unpack and repack would be possible.

It made by Unreal Engine 3

Here's a sample.

Script file and font file.

[https://www.gildor.org/downloads](https://www.gildor.org/downloads)

Files can be decompressed to 'Unreal Package Decompressor'.

It can also be extracted as 'Unreal Package Extractor'.

Unpack can be done with amodel, but repack is not possible.

I think it's zlib compressed.

I need help with unpack and repack.

Here is my tool for translating this game, but has not been fully tested. Let me know if the tool comes up with an error.
