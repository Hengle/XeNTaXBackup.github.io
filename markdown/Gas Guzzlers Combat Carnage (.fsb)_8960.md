Here's a screenshot from the start of one of the fsb files:

Is this an encryption or some xor?

This is ridiculous. This was his second post and you ban him.

If i register to a forum my first thing is to post my comment not read the f...ing rules.

Make a warn system, not ban. Nice welcome on this forum lol.

I agree, I have noticed this senseless banning terror just today and I don't understand it.

at this point why not just killing physically the people who violate the "rules"?
oh well probably this will be the next step :)

seriously if someone has links to new (serious!) forums where doing formats reversing they are welcome.

at the moment I'm not much interested in doing new formats reversing but considering that this forum is dead (I mean about this matter) I want to be ready when the desire will return.

Unfurtunately have to agree. I think sometimes some rules are too much.

I agree also. This new rule about posting game files is just too much. Instead we can only post small samples which in some cases DON"T HELP with the reversing.

As Craptain said. We have announced the new rules, because the previous rules were not enough to protect us from harm (cfr: Google withdrawing adds for copyright violation). We have also announced that we would start banning people if they would not abide to the new rules. We have also waited more than a month to start enforcing them with more vigour, to give people ample time to adjust their practice. And even then we have announced the banning would start soon. There has been enough warning. 

There are threads like this one: [viewtopic.php?f=10&t=8934](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=8934) that have proven the new rules need not at all limit what we are doing here: researching game files, modding games for fun. Look around and you will see that it works. 

Refrain from uploading or linking to copyrighted material in public is all we ask. 

kamuline, I'm sorry you got banned, and if you do not wish to read the rules before you post, then what can I say. They state ban is immediate. You were not banned completely, as you are back. Consider it a warning.

come on, you can't use that thread for comparison.
there you have a silly file format that needs some lines of bms script and about 30 seconds of time...
compare it with something that requires "real" reversing skills and the full archive or at least its big beginning/end.

then I have seen you have removed even links to partial cut files that can't be considered fully copyrighted material just like it's possible to listen the previews of commercial music.
if you follow this philosophy means that even posting an image of a hex editor of such "copyrighted material" must lead to a ban because you are displaying parts of copyrighted stuff.

although the new rules started from one month it's hard to think that something that is used to do from years (and I talk about LOT of years considering that I'm here from 2005 and I started QuickBMS in April 2009) suddenly finishes in one month with a direct banning of anyone who simply posts a link.

the copyrighted material was "copyrighted" in 2005 like it's now and about the Adsense issue, I would like to know if there was a difference in your incomes in the period of time between 2009 and 2011 compared with the pre-2009 one.
I have followed this forum daily in all this time and I can claim without doubts to have been the most active person here so I know perfectly that the traffic/visits (at least in the "Game Archive Research section) increased a lot in the last years with positive effects on the advertising incomes and the general rank.

Mr.Mouse, in my opinion you should just close the whole "Game Archive Research" section of the forum because you can't do file format reversing without having the game file/archive and consequently the description of this section must be removed because it breaks the rules:

```
Don't know how to open a certain game resource archive? Post it here, and let all of us take a look at it! We may be able to help you out!
```
we can't look at the archive of that user so this section can't exist at all.

anyway I'm "polemic mode" at the moment so take it easy :)

P.S.:
another thing I was forgiving.
changing the rules probably will allow you to have the Adsense account back (I guess this is the reason of all this terror) but what's the point of having the banners if you lose almost all the users?

every sub-section of "Game File Research" need files to work on (yes models, sounds, music, archives, images... all the sub-sections are affected) so it's obvious that all these sections can't live.

so what else remains?

the "General" section?
there is no content

"MultiEx Commander"?
does it still exist???
that section is dead.

"Tools & Programs"?
external tools and programs written by other people that can be found with google.
the only exception is just Noesis, and I don't know if the new rules will affect it too.

I'm just making some logical considerations, it's not an "attack".
this is the situation I'm seeing, am I wrong?

the celt codec should be supported by its own tools or some programs that support such codec.
I don't remember much because it's something I tested many months ago and the only thing I noticed was that the files were raw headerless.
that's the max I know.

I really have to agree to Luigi.
I was on both sides of the scene for quite some time - requesting help and helping others. Since the new rules, EVERYTHING has stopped for me: I don't help others anymore because there aren't any sample files and I'd have to request them from the user. That really feels like begging to help them. To be honest, I don't feel like it, it's just too much of a fuzz. So what else do I do? I also don't ask for help anymore because I know how it feels now to post.
So, my research has completely moved to private. I don't want to contribute here anymore because it simply takes several times the effort to help somebody.
In addition it is COMPLETE NONSENSE to remove WHOLE POSTS because of just one link to a copyrighted file. That simply destroys ALL information that was once there, even if it's important. Whole topics simply become obsolete with this plain exercise of (admin) power. These rules have just be decided by very few persons - NO user here was asked. Yes, the linking to sample files may be illegal but what will effectively happen? If someone will shut down the forum (what I don't really believe will happen) it's the exact same outcome that the new rules have right now: The community here will sooner or later die. Face it. 

I don't understand why the rules are so vital for the future of the forum. 

PLEASE EXPLAIN WHAT COULD EFFECTIVELY HAPPEN IF THE OLD RULES WOULD STILL APPLY!!!

XeNTaX was once my favourite resource for format research. At the moment, it's not anymore.

I think some of you are overlooking the fact that this change is an inevitable necessity, especially because of where Xentax is hosted and where most of us are located. This is the only way to avoid the eventual destruction of Xentax. It's better to adapt now while we still have headroom to do so, and find new ways to act as a meaningful community.

The most meaningful aspect of this community has always been the actual act of reversing file formats. It hasn't been about actual exchange of data, that has merely been a convenient means to an end. There are other ways. Why not discuss those other ways, rather than saying "we can't share copyrighted data anymore, therefore Xentax is dead" and pointlessly throwing your arms up in the air? And we can certainly be more open about reversing those "complicated" file formats than we have been. Usually someone posts sample files, then everyone else privately looks at the format, there's little to no open collaboration, and then someone just pops up and posts a program/script. Why not also take this opportunity to be more open with each other about collaborating on new file formats? In this way, we'd also establish new friendships and private social circles wherein people can do whatever the hell they like for exchanging file data.

We lose our source of income and xentax will eventually die. I'm sorry if it's somewhat inconvenient to have to ask for samples, but publicly peddling illegal goods is not logically necessary for what we are doing here.

I may be garbage, a leecher. But it's people like Luigi and Alpha with their contributions that essentially made Xentax. Most users visit this place because of men like them -- I know I got lured here because of their expertise. If you're scaring'em off, you're killing Xentax just as effectively as lack of income would -- the only factor here that is different is the pace of it. If the old source of income fails you, simply find new ones - they're there if you wish to look.

@MrAdults
I don't get you at all. 

- Reverse-engineering is as prohibited as sharing copyrighted files. This forum has been involved in illegal activities since the start. Everybody knows that and nobody from any developer or publisher has ever contacted the admin or am I wrong? And suddenly, out of the blue, parts of these activities are restricted. Where's the contingency? Prohibiting one illegal activity but allowing another one makes no sense whatsoever in my eyes. Even posting a script that extracts the contents on a GRAF is illegal! If you want to pursue this way of legality, you have to shut down the whole forum!

- Working together? Ok, let me just state the facts: when sample files were allowed, anyone could download them and take a look. Now everybody has to ask via PM for a link. It can't possibly be the case that the same number that downloaded files back then are now contacting users to ask for links. No... just no. It's simply not the case. How can one think that a major coplication in the reversing process will strengthen the community  

There is just no logic behind the new rules. So it can only be an emotional act of some admin for whatever personal reason. Prove me wrong.

Need I quote more to stress my last assumption? To recap this: If XeNTaX is shut down, ADMINS WILL LOSE MONEY!
I'm just speechless. I'd consequently delete all my posts and never return here if I followed my instinct right now but I'll wait - because I really hope that I understood something wrong.

Interesting discussion. It seems the inconvenience for you is more important than abiding to a few laws. My estimate is 80+ games are released on various platforms each month, with many of them having downloadable demos for anyone to download legally. I understand your troubles, but you do not see ours. Honestly, if you feel so bad about this all, and do not wish to come to a workable situation because it causes so much problems for you, then you must make your own decision. 

Aluigi has earned a lot of respect, and he is a great guy. The early history of the board lies in 2003 however, when I set this up, with Craptain, and Watto. Where Watto and I would do all the analysing, posting scripts, program updates and such. That was the start and was the situation for some years. Many others came, including aluigi, with his great quickbms fork of mexscript, and his relentless talent. There is also no doubt about Alpha. 

And then we have many more talented people here and each contributes to a fine community where no file needs to go unravelled. But we have to find the workable balance between what is in the grey area, and what is downright illegal. Again, I'm sorry aluigi drops the bomb on us.  But what we will not be is a warez site. And what we will not pursue is pre-release file analysis. And we will stop a type of conduct that we once thought was possible or cool, but now seems to be causing more problems than it solves. 

Like MrAdults said: we can do a lot more, than just prompting scripts for each sample uploaded. If that is not your game, and you cannot or simply will not understand where we are coming from, then that is a disappointment.

OK, i have an idea.
Register at THIS forum, make a request and upoad your sample there. As i see its not forbidden.
Then post the link to the forum. So you dont share the files directly.

Coders register too, and dl the sample.

We better to find a new place then, cause here with those new rules isn't a good place to hack game formats anymore.
