- Post Title: Hi ^^could someone please give me the MVC3 model of chun li?

Hello everyone 
im a complete stranger

Oh noes :O

and im planning toward creating a street fighter animation
in 3D

I commissioned a friend
to create this character fro me so far

heres the render
[http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-dQfCmQ9tU-c/T ... /cammy.jpg](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-dQfCmQ9tU-c/TkvZEyG9HuI/AAAAAAAAATs/72xfFZShXU0/s1600/cammy.jpg)

more characters are also 
on there way 

im hoping someone could help me out 
with something

if its not too much trouble. 

y'see it would really be helpful to us if some one could give me 
the MVC3 model of chun li with textures 

even if they can port it to xnlara or 
something i could convert it with there tool

into an OBJ

im sure the tombraider forums would also like the model to add to there collection

once i have that model my friend could use it 
to create a custom chun li
for the animation im planning for

the style of the model will work well with my animation ^^
im hoping by the end of the year to have 

Cammy commissioned
Juni commissioned
Juli commissioned

Chun li customized
then commissioned 

also
Ryu and Final M.bison created 
alpha 3 ver.

made in zbrush by myself

and all textures 
in HD

all ready for the animation

I take my role very seriously and have been planning this for a year and a half
I really want to make something people will love too watch on you tube 
maybe even figure out how to make it stereographic for those that own a 3DS 
or monitor that can produce that 3D effect

its expensive to make these characters 
so id appreciate it if i had the chun li model

ill even add the person who helps me out in the credits of the animation
with a special thanks.
