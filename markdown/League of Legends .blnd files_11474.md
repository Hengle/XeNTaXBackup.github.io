- Post Title: League of Legends .blnd files

Hello everyone!

I've been trying to read some .blnd (not .blend for Blender) files from LoL, but I hadn't had much luck. They seem to contain a list of files and parameters that are used by the game itself, kind of a manifest. Can anyone help me out?

Here are 2 of those files:
[SightWardBase.blnd (simple)](https://mega.co.nz/#!f1hlnB6T!RsMhvJAnbL-bgCpH87W0IzP1BWqJpxQjRLMv11TJ8aQ)
[RumbleSkin03.blnd (more complex)](https://mega.co.nz/#!GpB3SBSJ!Z0sRejNlJ7SOJyM5MTLYg702TxVoMQEsFVbTXokqkz0)

Cheers!

1) I said "Try"
2) RAF Manager it's tool for edit RAF (DAT) and files inside archives
3) I guess that the files that you are interested is from the archives...

You must be one bad troll.
Given the fact that I already have the files means I used RAF Manager to get them out of the .raf files. RAF Manager doesn't read .blnd files, which is what I need. You said it yourself that RAF Manager is for RAF files, yet you say I should use it for my .blnd files. You either are bipolar or there must be a short circuit in that big head of yours.
