- Post Title: Any suggest for a rippable PC game with huge monster sounds?

Hey peepls, 

I'm a musician and I've ripped some audio to use in my latest track. The track is coming out sic as hell but I need some real nasty huge monster sounds to finish it off. I've been searching forever and I can't seem to find anything that I like that I can extract the audio out of. I'm thinking something along the lines of Resident Evil, Godzilla, Jurassic park, mutants, giant monsters, dragons etc.. 

I've been doing mostly PC rips but I can learn XBOX 360 if I have to.. 

Any ideas would be very much appreciated. 

Nebo

Wow not a single suggestion.. I'm surprised, so many Sound Design enthusiasts, you'd think at least one person would have some suggestions..

Well I can recommend Amnesia the Dark Descent. It has some monster groans that you possibly could use. The files I found were already in .ogg so it shouldn't be too hard to convert them to whatever format you need. This is a link to some of those sounds found in the game: [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ly9Si-cSanU](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ly9Si-cSanU). I hope this helps. You can get the game on steam.

If you just want suggestions, how about using sound bytes of Justin Bieber, Rebecca Black, or maybe Lady Gaga?  They aren't in any PC game, but they are all pretty scary suggestions.

Sephiroth1089 Thanks for the suggestion.. Those are def some great sounds.. I think they'll sound really good layered with something more aggressive.. I'm going to work on that later.. =) 

brienj.. I think you've confused the word scary with terrible, its a common misconception.. To be honest; I have no idea what Justin & Rebecca Black's music sounds like and I plan to keep it that way..  As for Lady Gaga, if I was going to remix something that sounded like that (which I wouldn't), I'd just go to the original sources Madonna & Cher..   

Any other suggestions for monster/brute/mutant/dragon/etc roars?

For monsters - Doom 3, Quake series. Or even Call of Cthulhu.
About dragons - I dunno. You can try Skyrim.
