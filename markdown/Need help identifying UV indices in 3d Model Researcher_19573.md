- Post Title: Need help identifying UV indices in 3d Model Researcher

I'm trying to get these UVs to fit on a texture for a helmet in a game I'm modding. I've had no other problems with other models, as none have required UV indices. I think the helmets require UV indices, and the model researcher tutorial isn't very helpful in identifying these. The polygons are supposed to fit onto the curved white stripes. Any insights?

Here's the polygons with texture and UV parameters:



Here's what it looks like on the model with mesh parameters:



Here's the files I'm using:

What do you mean with " the helmets require UV indices"?
why not scale ty?

How did you scale that? I'm using the free version of Model Researcher, but I'm assuming you did that in blender?

I used the model researcher guide to figure out all of this stuff. The guide used a cow as an example. When the UV map didn't align with the texture file, you could fill in UV indices to get everything looking right, but the guide didn't explain this very well. I'm hoping to edit and reinject these textures and I just wanted to use a model to make sure it all looks good. Scaling the Y is a good work around, thanks!

import obj to blender; in UV/Image Editor 
a ctrl my <ENTER>
(select all, invert uvs vertically)

sy <ENTER>
(scale y)

Noob question: How do you get the UV map visualized on top of the texture?

EDIT: Figured it out, never mind!
