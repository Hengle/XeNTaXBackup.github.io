Exactly what I have been looking for, thanks.

Just a question, though. How exactly do I get to the files? I did extract the Art.dat to Art.dec, but I can't open that in anything, is there a specific format I need to extract it to, or am I just missing something?

Thanks.

Great, exactly what I needed, thanks.

But I have a small problem, when I pack everything, the game gives me an error, [http://i.imgur.com/6Frvh9a.png](http://i.imgur.com/6Frvh9a.png) but the thing is, the file is there.

Any solution?

What's your version of the game? Can you send me a PM Art.dat.dec original file and folder that you try to pack?

That's the thing, I did encrypt it. However, it only does it when I include certain files, so there has to be a problem with some files only, so I'll try redoing them from the scratch.

How to encrypt Art.dec back to Art.dat? I made few changes in the folder that you provided for 1.1.65, used PPTools to convert it into .dec file... what's next?
