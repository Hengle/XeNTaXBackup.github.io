Hi, idk if you still care, but modding music requires a program you can use to extract the game's audio files and replace them. You can find that and more DOA6 mod tools here (also warning, lots of NSFW ads): [https://www.loverslab.com/topic/120211- ... edelbe-30/](https://www.loverslab.com/topic/120211-vagonumero13-tools-redelbe-rdbtool-g1mtools-doa6decsave-update-17-aug-redelbe-30/)
