- Post Title: Stitching ton of WAVs into a single audio file

I have around 460x wav files for a single song that are 2 seconds each
Is there a way how to stitch these all together into a single audio file? 

VirtualDub has a similar feature where it automatically stitches image sequences into a video file, but I couldn't find any such thing for audio

Each track is labeled as "{trackName}_{number}.wav"
