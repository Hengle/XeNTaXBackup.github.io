- Post Title: Is it possible to rip Ring of Elysium models?

Apologies if this is the wrong place to post but I was directed to make a thread and ask here. From what I understand the gun models are for lack of a better word "shit" however I very much like the Shadow Hikage model within the game and have been messing with the .vfs files and haven't figured out how to properly break them down.
