- Post Title: Armored Core V archive extraction

So I was looking for a way to open these files, and I found this old thread:
[viewtopic.php?f=10&t=8125](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=8125)
However the script provided in there is not working for me. I did not want to bump such an old thread, so I am making a new one instead.
Is there a way to fix this "no such file or directory" error?

I'm not promising anything but you can try bms script included in Fatduck Importer. It's in "BMS/Armored_Core_For_Answer.bms"

That's for a different game in a different engine.
