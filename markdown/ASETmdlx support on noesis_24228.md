- Post Title: ASET/mdlx support on noesis

hello, ive been reading through forum threads to see if i find anything related to this topic for hours now, but they are usually either dead, or inconclusive. 
right i got a dump of a kh2fm iso, and have used the kh_xldii to take a look at the models and animations, ive also exported the animations into an ASET file. heres the problem i wasnt able to preview any of the files mdlx or ASET on noesis. i read around and gathered that noesis at one point with the kh2 revelations plugin could read mdlx files no problem and for whatever reason cant on newer versions(the cut off point seems to be around 2016 or so), to test this i used wayback to download previous version of noesis, and almost as if it were magic it worked perfectly, used the same plugin on both versions.

i have to ask why, is there plugins missing on the latest version? thanks.

for anyone curious im using noesisv4.2 for this
