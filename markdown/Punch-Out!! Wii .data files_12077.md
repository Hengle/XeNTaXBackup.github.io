- Post Title: Punch-Out!! Wii .data files

I am looking to extract the audio and model data from an ISO rip of Punch-Out!! 2009 (I have a legal hardcopy and only have a rip for research/backup purposes). Much of the data in the game comes in .data and .debug formats. Though my friend [RandomTBush](http://www.models-resource.com/submitter/Random+Talking+Bush/) has been able to extract texture files from the game, we have not had any success as of yet to discover useable model files.

To be honest, I seek these files for the purpose of using them in machinima. I intend to use these models for non-commercial purposes, to make fan movies of the game. They might have to be ported to another game engine, as I have familiarized myself with the Source engine for its Source Filmmaker utility, but it would still be nice for the models to be accessible, non-commercially always, for those of us who are still fans of the game.

Is there any way known to look into these models?

Perhaps you could try using ninja ripper? I heard it can rip models from wii games
