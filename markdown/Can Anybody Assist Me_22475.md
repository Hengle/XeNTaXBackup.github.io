- Post Title: Can Anybody Assist Me?

Hey there!
Hope you're all well!
I have a Mac laptop, I have no idea about game files or anything like that but I'm working on a project and I'm looking for somebody who may be able to assist me in extracting game files (models, videos, textures and interesting stuff) from the 2003 PC/console game The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King. I'm not sure what engine the game uses but it is an Electronic Arts title.

I'm grateful for any help you can offer me.
Stay well!
