- Post Title: [PS1] Silent Hill Character/Enemy Sound Files (Dialogue, Damage Noises, etc.)

After a long fight with the Silent Hill Tools, I was able to extract the files from the SILENT file within the BIN file of the game.
I'm currently exploring the various VAD files using VGMTrans, but I've had no luck finding what I'm looking for.
I'm wondering if they could possibly be in another place entirely?
Anybody with insight on this and whether Silent Hill follows a similar structure to other PS1 games would be HIGHLY appreciated.
