- Post Title: Smackdown Vs. Raw 2011 PT Explorer

I was wondering if it would be possible for anyone to make PT Explorer work with SvR 2011 Paint Tool files.  Or a new verzion specifically for the 2011 files. Here is my sample paint tool file with the first two slots having an image. It seems to be setup a lot like last years as far as logo sizes and such go.

Also, what are the images in the slots? Got pictures of them? How many pictures can the .pt file hold?

Okay, here's the first image. Is it's background white, or black? EDIT: Never mind, extracted another one. Background should be white prolly:

Good. The format has changed. It now saves images in three different formats each time for each slot: raw ARGB per pixel (4 channels), the old format (with 256 colour palette), and as DDS.

Would love to see a 2011 update to pt explorer.
Last year's version was a great tool which took the game way beyond.

Is it just me or are people already doing this without PT Explorer. Some CAWs online I keep seeing have dead on logos and stuff, so they're doing it somehow!!

Just bumping to add in my support.  Mr. Mouse, your work made SvR 2010 tolerable- no hurry, but I hope you can crack the format, I'd love to see the paint tool hack back for 2011.  Thanks for all you've done and for all you will do in the future!

Consider me still interested ...

And I would be happy to help with any testing that needs to happen.
Send me a PM and let me know if you think you might look at this.

Last year's version was a great tool.
I have already started to see PS3 hacks happening ..

Drop me a line ...

You haven't frequented the forums that talk about SvR or been to my forum lately.   

It's all that anyone wants for the game this year.

Well that and people wanting to add models to the game like last year, which is possible, and I'll be eventually adding support for it in my program.  It's just hard to be motivated when I know what they all plan on adding to the game.  Ugh.

There's definitely a desire for it, all my friends want it and I'd be posting constantly but I don't want to piss anyone off.
