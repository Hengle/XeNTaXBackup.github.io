- Post Title: Metal Wolf Chaos XD .phyre textures

Hi, i'm going mad trying to open the phyre texture from metal wolf chaos.

I already tried the quickBMS script but it gives an error:

```
       Can't read 109440 bytes from offset 00051094.
       Anyway don't worry, it's possible that the BMS script has been written
       to exit in this way if it's reached the end of the archive so check it
       or contact its author or verify that all the files have been extracted.
       Please check the following coverage information to know if it's ok.

  coverage file -1  100%   331924     331924     . offset 00051094

Last script line before the error or that produced the error:
  448 log NAME 0 PREALLOC MEMORY_FILE
```


Noesis helped me to watch and extract the textures, but sadly I cannot reimport them
As far I can see texturex are in BC7 format.

Can anyone help me? I will append an example texture
