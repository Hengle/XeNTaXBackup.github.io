I managed to get some of the files from Jurassic the Hunted from the 360, but most of the files are encrypted in XDS format

mainly Dinosaur models are all i'm trying to access but I need help in order to figure out

so if anyone wishes to test the files here is a link [http://sta.sh/01bb9qxql0gy](http://sta.sh/01bb9qxql0gy)

the folder titled "actors" is where the XDS in which I assume all dinosaur models are located
as for the "T Rex" and "Spinosaurus" folders just contain animations incase anybody wanted to figure out how to decrypt them, but there is no need for the animations
