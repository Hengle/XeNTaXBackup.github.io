[n] Resource data

The data is padded into chunks of 2048. So the next resource begins offset = ((Size - (Size mod 2048) / 2048) +1) *2048

SYSTEM.CNF seems to be the disk's boot settings, SLUS_008.84 is the executable, ZANZIBAR.000 is 28.0 MB, but contains only zero bytes, and there's FILE.000 to 003.
