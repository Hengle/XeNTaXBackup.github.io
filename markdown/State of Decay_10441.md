You think dragon unpacker support State of Decay? it is not, i think
on x360 dds files maybe compressed (sometimes maybe not), i mean they unreadable untill you will decompress it, i don't know how to do, but i know who can and some files you can find here :

if you can code on C#, you can find some info about xbox 360 texture compression algorithm inside source file of this tool (download file from link upper).

UPD: use it to unpack archives, but you can't open dds anyway for now
