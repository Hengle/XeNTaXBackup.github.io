- Post Title: Extract scripts - PSP VN (.bin format)

Hello !
I trying to extract the scripts of a PSP VN (The port of Da Capo I&II Plus on PSP) to edit them.
But the scripts (in the file script.bin) are in the bin format. I believe it's just an archive,so how I can extract them,please ?

Here is the link for the file :
