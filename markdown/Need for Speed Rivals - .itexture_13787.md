- Post Title: Need for Speed Rivals - .itexture

Hello, I am trying to edit some Need for Speed Rivals textures and I need help.

After dumping the game, I have tried  to extract/convert the .itexture files, in order to get readable dds files, but I fail. The extracted results are some useless, very strangely proportioned (2048x1 px e.t.c) but with right names, dds files. I have tried using the following tools:
-Bf4 texture converter (Batch_Itexture_Converter_BF4.exe) by Dainiuxxx
-Star Wars Battlefront texture converter (Batch_Itexture_Converter.exe) by Dainiuxxx

Is there anything I can do?

Why don't you post this in the right forum ? Graphic formats?
