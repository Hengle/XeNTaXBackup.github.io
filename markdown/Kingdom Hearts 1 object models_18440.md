- Post Title: Kingdom Hearts 1 object models?

Greetings.
I'm wondering if anyone has managed to rip object models from the first Kingdom Hearts for PS2 before?
Currently the dumper I got seems to only extract NPC/Character models, which I already have.
What I am looking for are the actual objects(not keyblades you see displayed in the Worlds etc as decoration, much like the ones you can easily rip from KH2.
