- Post Title: Enemy Territory Quake Wars .MEGA textures?

I remember reading somewhere the process of making Megatextures being very time consuming as it's a cooked file that's processed for the game to understand a huge amount of texture information.  I was wondering if there's a way to convert or extract whatever is inside these huge files?

You know, the rules state we need an example.
