Could someone take a crack at this?

All i want mainly is geometry+skeleton and Anims.

Incase you need sample files, here they are: [https://mega.nz/#F!gVVzTTwL!JdrNtQ3mrl6QanW9nHNJKg](https://mega.nz/#F!gVVzTTwL!JdrNtQ3mrl6QanW9nHNJKg)

I found multiple formats, so im not sure what are the correct ones.

I also included textures, would be nice to see how they work.
Also, lemme know if you need ANY other files, i will be happy to help.

I don't know about the textures, some have bc7 in their file name which could be a clue and Noesis might even be able to open them with a proper bc7 dds header.

Coolio. Anything on skeletons and anims? Even getting the geometry is already a nice progress, thanks for your collaboration!

Excellent work!  I'm excited to see progress this soon.  It looks like ID did a really solid job on the topology too, so it'll be exciting to see where things progress from here.  Are the meshes natively in quad or tri format?

Yes, it's triangles.  MD6model is the end game format, not the original source file.  I'm sure they use 3dsmax/Maya for that.

btw, does someone have a bms script to extract the resources from this game?
Or it is the same as Wolfenstein New Order (index/resources) ?

On a russian forum, in a doom alpha thread (not sure if i can tell which site because warez), there's a tool called DOOMExtract, which is what i used to extract those models (and the game's content).

So i guess the md6 is the real target here.

Hooray! Can't wait to see if you ever figure out the anims.

If you do, i don't even know what to say or how i will react.

Nice work so far!

> Vertex-bone assignment seems to be working now.

The only thing left is weights.  But, again, I had the same problem in Wolfenstein New Order.
The vertex format doesn't seem to store weights.  The two DWORDs after the UVs appear to be something else.  
Perhaps related to UVs, like tangents or binormals.

So, where are the weights?
Code: Select all[ 0] (vert: -14.925090, -3.421478, -2.702209)  (uv: 0.771800, 0.289900)  (1CC9, 0061, A781, 0006)  (  1,   1,   1,   1)
[ 1] (vert: -15.840547, -3.475029, -2.295240)  (uv: 0.767700, 0.310000)  (0181, 0086, 7B81, 0001)  (  1,   1,   1,   1)
[ 2] (vert: -14.925090, -3.475029, -2.295240)  (uv: 0.767700, 0.289900)  (56F8, 008A, 6481, 0004)  (  1,   1,   1,   1)
[ 3] (vert: -15.840547, -3.317927, -1.915936)  (uv: 0.763600, 0.310000)  (1481, 00C5, 3C81, 0014)  (  1,   1,   1,   1)
[ 4] (vert: -14.925090, -3.318054, -1.915936)  (uv: 0.763600, 0.289900)  (33C9, 00C8, 2A81, 0022)  (  1,   1,   1,   1)

[ 7] (vert: -15.840547, -2.585207, -1.612391)  (uv: 0.755300, 0.310000)  (8580, 00FF, 0181, 0086)  (  1,   1,   1,   1)
[ 8] (vert: -14.925090, -2.585207, -1.612391)  (uv: 0.755300, 0.289900)  (93DC, 00D7, 0481, 009D)  (  1,   1,   1,   1)
[ 9] (vert: -15.840547, -2.205903, -1.769494)  (uv: 0.751200, 0.310000)  (C480, 00EC, 1481, 00C5)  (  1,   1,   1,   1)
etc...

Are the vertex weights needed by the anims in any way? If not, it is fine for me and my friend (we just wanted to port the guns)

I hope bethesda doesn't discover this before we get stuff done.

I'm done with it.  Nothing else can be done without weights or textures.

Maybe NinjaRipper can help getting textures.

I am nearly certain that NinjaRipper cannot get the textures. 
See this thread on how to get them: [viewtopic.php?f=10&t=11542&hilit=Wolfenstein](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=11542&hilit=Wolfenstein)

 this thread here should give you all the tools you need to get this files eventually into a program like Blender and then you should likely be able to convert the models via blender to the format you wish for. that is if these models are much the same as past ID tech md6 bmd6model formats and that's a big if.  so in theory it should work but I don't have time to play with the files myself and see if the tools on this thread will work the same on doom's beta models. but this should give you a place to start.

Hey guys! Here's maxscript to import DOOM's .bmodel/.bmd6model, if someone would like to import them. Script isn't finished, so please if anyone will have problems with importing models, send those problematic models via PM. Also, I would like to ask someone to send me samples of textures and skeleton in order to implement rigging support (.bmd6modelskl and .bimage)

EDIT: I've got skeleton samples and info about them, thanks a lot to Killercracker. Only .bimage textures left

I found a program called Ultimate Unwrap 3D Pro. This program allows you to open bmd6model with bones, if any.



Unwrap3DPro-DOOM-Revenant.jpg (217.24 KiB) Viewed 381 times



Unfortunately only a demo is available for free, it is possible to open the file, but that's to save the file in a different format will not work.
I searched through the entire Internet for the full version, but did not find. If by then know what to do, then please give an answer.
Program and plugins (demo) can be downloaded from here: [http://www.unwrap3d.com/u3d/downloads.aspx](http://www.unwrap3d.com/u3d/downloads.aspx)

About Ultimate Unwrap 3D Pro you should ask Wobble, I think a creator of the program? I'm sure you wouldn't find full version for free, you must buy it first. Though, if you need model with bones I can give you a script to import them, but not much help from them since there's no textures, right?

Hello everyone! It has come to my attention that several posts made in this thread, on two occasions have clearly breached our forum rules. As a result, multiple posts have since been removed with warnings/bans handed out.

Please be mindful of our rules, otherwise we'll unfortunately have to take action. Multiple breaches of forum rules will eventually lead to permanent bans.

Great work so far, to those who have contributed! I'll be keeping an eye on this thread.

When doom finally ships i'll probably update (or rewrite) the blender importer I made for Rage/Wolfenstein. But I'm not going to bother with the beta, things could change.

If that ultimate unwrap program works, then the Wolfenstein:New Order script should work, since Ultimate Unwrap is supporting the Wolfenstein: New Order version of b6model according to the website.

Hi

We can use for each vertex 4 weights- the same  [0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25].


about bone map

```
file: baron.bmd6model;baseModel



Here is  a list of bone  indices

go to section SecId=6 ( http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?p=117917#p117917 )

offset 1328	(0, 1, 2, 5, 8, 11, 14, 27, 40, 49, 52, 55, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 15, 28, 47, 50, 53, 56, 58, 66, 74, 59, 67, 75, 60, 68, 76, 61, 69, 77, 82, 16, 29, 48, 51, 54, 57, 62, 70, 78, 63, 71, 79, 64, 72, 80, 65, 73, 81, 83, 3, 6, 9, 12, 17, 30, 18, 31, 19, 32, 20, 33, 21, 34, 4, 7, 10, 13, 22, 35, 23, 36, 24, 37, 25, 38, 26, 39, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95)

we must convert 
[0,1,2,5,8,11,14...] = [0:0,1:1,2:2,3:5,4:8,5:11,6:14...] - just add index to each element in list,  index:value

now we replace index=>value and value=>index like 5:11=>11:5 where 11 is now index and 5 is value

0:0,1:1,2:2,...,5:3,...,8:4,...,11:5,...,14:6...

it is correct bone map
[0, 1, 2, 56, 70, 3, 57, 71, 4, 58, 72, 5, 59, 73, 6, 18, 37, 60, 62, 64, 66, 68, 74, 76, 78, 80, 82, 7, 19, 38, 61, 63, 65, 67, 69, 75, 77, 79, 81, 83, 8, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 20, 39, 9, 21, 40, 10, 22, 41, 11, 23, 42, 24, 27, 30, 33, 43, 46, 49, 52, 25, 28, 31, 34, 44, 47, 50, 53, 26, 29, 32, 35, 45, 48, 51, 54, 36, 55, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95]



```


here is a blend file ( use Blender version 249b )with model of baron with auto IK - press key G and move a mouse

Great findings Mariusz! That's how I generated weights too  [0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25], though, your thing with bone map is absolutely brilliant really, I did other thing and it wasn't good in all the cases xD Can someone who have the game confirm if iOrange's tool extracting textures too? This would be epic, perfect moment to actually finish model-import part

For 3ds max users updated version with skeleton, as it was requested before

Oh, sorry about that!  Please install VS2015 Runtime libraries from Microsoft's website - [https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/downloa ... x?id=49984](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=49984)

BTW - there's a new version of the tool, support for DooM Alpha version added.

It did not help!

And I have two questions regarding this program:
1. this program allows you to view files formats .bmd6skl and .bmd6anim ?
2. can I export the model in .fbx ?

Well please help with glitch!

zaramot, can you tell me how to create scripts for 3DS Max?

Well please help with glitch!

I don't have Windows 10, so I can't try to run the application there, but try to install this - should help - [https://www.microsoft.com/en-ca/downloa ... x?id=48145](https://www.microsoft.com/en-ca/download/details.aspx?id=48145)

BTW. The new version just came up - DoomResEx v0.3
With this new version you can export DooM rigged models into FBX with all bones and proper bones-to-vertices attachment and proper weights (properly decoded weights, not simply [0.25])

Thank you, your file is now awaiting review by the administrator moddb.com, when available, will test.

And here's another question you tested the animation?

I downloaded and launched, 0xc000007b!

A few hours searching for a solution, I realized what the problem is, your program not compatible with the Windows 10 OS.

So we assume that the problem with models of DOOM is not solved.

Please check your PM for the instructions.

As for the models - what do you mean? All model types are fully supported by the tool.
You can extract static models to OBJ with proper normals and uv-s.
You can even extract rigged models into FBX with properly reconstructed skeleton and properly decoded bones-to-vertices assignments and corresponding weights.

Everything. I mean i'm not sure how i'm supposed to even list all that. Since I have over 120 steam games, it's probably installed everything from VC++ 2008 thru VC++ 2015,  DirectX 9.0c, DirectX 2010, and every other variant. Windows 10 is just Windows 7 + new junk so, nothing is incompatible. I've yet to find a single program I had on Windows 7 that doesn't run on Windows 10. Even some old Vista stuff still works lol.

It would be nice if this program dumped a log file of its actions, so it would be easier to track down when and where a crash occurs.
crash.JPG

Sorry bro, there's a lot of stuff I have in my TODO list, but I have only a couple hours of my spare time beside my job and wife/kids.
BTW - it seems you're trying to export model from Alpha version. Rigged models from Alpha version are different from Beta.
By now - my tool fully supports Beta version, and partially - Alpha.

I don't see a reason to spend my time to add full support for Alpha, cuz release is tomorrow, and I'd like to support it than some outdated versions.

Here's the result of exporting models from Beta - [https://youtu.be/4V6erK0FhbM?t=427](https://youtu.be/4V6erK0FhbM?t=427)

PS. I plan to release the source code pack named "DooM SDK" that will contain all the code needed to read DooM archives / images / models  et cetera.

So Alpha crashes your program?  Too bad.  I missed Open Beta release on Steam.

Special for you - fixed crash on Alpha models. Download here - [https://bitbucket.org/iOrange/doomresex ... x_v031.zip](https://bitbucket.org/iOrange/doomresex/downloads/DoomResEx_v031.zip)

But - no skeleton for Alpha models   Sorry, the format is different from Beta, I just don't want to waste my time reversing this.
I'm busy with virtual textures now.

Oh, and more, that I have 0xc000007b on two computers pops up. Reinstalling the OS does not help.

The problem with glitch 0xc000007b disappeared also a mysterious as it had come, and now everything works. Maybe I will never know in what was the problem.

I tested Doom Resources Explorer v3 in the final full game. It works perfectly.

Yet it is desirable to make the support of export .png

Hey guys! I have merged the other Doom alpha/beta topic into this one and cleaned it up a little bit. There's no need for two threads active threads on the same game. All discussion should remain here, regardless of alpha/beta format differences in mind.

Please be aware there's an edit button, there is absolutely no need to post 3-4 times within the space of a few hours, creating spam.

It's great to see how much progress has been made!

Cheers!

I've fixed the tool - some models are different from the Beta version.
Version 0.4 will have full support of the release version.
Will be uploaded to the MODDB this night.

BTW - the tool exports rigged models to FBX 2016.0, so please update your import plugins or use more recent versions of your 3D Tools.

BTW - DoomResEx v0.4 just came out - [http://www.moddb.com/games/doom-4/downl ... plorer-v04](http://www.moddb.com/games/doom-4/downloads/doom-resources-explorer-v04)

This version is at least the has already opens are more files than the previous one, but .fbx files are still open only 3D Builder.

I propose to add the following supplement program:
1. ability to open formats: tga, dmodel, decl
2. Open a separate model, not bmd6model with skl, separately bmd6model, separately bmd6skl, separately bmd6anim, etc.

TGA files - just Extract them and use, no need to convert.
Decl files - just Extract them, the're  simply a text files.
DModel files - what's that? Did you mean bmodel? It's fully supported.

I know it's not easy. I spent nearly a month on figuring that out and was finally stumped at figuring out the variant of JPEG-XR image compression they use. I really look forward to seeing someone break this open.

Man, I have to give you a huge, huge thanks, iOrange. Your dedication and progress is legendary. I am very eagerly awaiting for you to figure out how to extract the textures!

Small question - it seems that I can't open up the FBX I exported from DoomResEx with 3DS Max 2013. Do I ABSOLUTELY need newer version of 3DS max, or can I somehow make it work with 2013?

I assume that texture is encrypted, so that their will be difficult to find.

But for FBX you probably need a program until 2016 of the year.

Unfortunately - Autodesk does not provide standalone FBX plugins for 3DS Max anymore 
I'm trying to find a way to export FBX 2009 version, but it seems that older FBX SDKs are not compatible with Visual Studio 2015 

So, sorry bro - you need to get newer version of 3DS Max (2016/2017).

If anyone have an idea of the output format for the rigged models - give me a shout and I'll implement it in the tool.

Is there any ETA on getting the textures extracted?

I also attempted to use OpenGL rippers as to attempt to obtain the textures the other way. I can confirm that I couldn't get  RenderDoc, GLIntercept, INTEL GPA nor APITrace to work. GLIntercept was just causing DOOM to crash on loading screen, APITrace is extremely buggy and is not able to extract a single texture that is not from the main menu and everything else just doesn't recognize Doom no matter what I tried. Seems like the only option here is to just get the textures the old fashion way.

[img.][http://i.heykidwannayiff.com/f4cf4b.jpg](http://i.heykidwannayiff.com/f4cf4b.jpg)[/img]
This is the furthest I managed to get with APITrace

SMD is deprecated. DMX (Data Model eXchange) is way more up to date file format.

So I was messing more with APITrace and guess what I managed to RIP and tear from Doom 4

The Doom 4 cubemap!

[im.g][http://i.heykidwannayiff.com/62cec0.png](http://i.heykidwannayiff.com/62cec0.png)[/img]

Only reason why I managed to extract this is because it seems like iD did some custom job on Virtual/Super textures 2 so no OpenGL custom DLL can work with the textures due of some custom OpenGL API for the textures BUT GL_TEXTURE_CUBE_MAP is still part of the default OpenGL API with OpenGL rippers can work with

And I have a question to the iOrange: So what to do with bmd6anim?

And who knows how to create an extractor such as DOOMExtract ? To know how to create such a program, then I have able to create a program to extract files from .mega2 and .pages

Well ?

Is anyone working on converting files like _vmtr_q4.mega2 into one huge texture file? 

I believe in ETQW the megatexture consisted out of many 64x64 tiles which were jpeg-compressed. Stiching all together lead to a 32Kx32K tga file with 4 GB which most image viewers can't handle.

GLIntercept was working for me, or at least it seemed to be? It was periodically updating two 8192x8192 images with a new chunk or set of chunks, but unfortunately I wasn't able to run it long enough to get anything substantial over an incomplete set of particle effects and decals, or files we can already get directly through DoomResEx.



Note that this screenshot is after massive cleanup of the folder, in most cases I was getting at least 6 copies of the textures so I kept going through and deleting older content after comparing it with the newer ones. I plan on running it overnight tonight, I cleared up a good 120+ gigs in preparation for the mass of files I'll have to look through when I wake up, but it'll be worth it if I end up with some completed megatextures.

Unfortunately, even with an overnight dump, I'll probably only be scratching the surface as the above image is the result of about a couple hours. If anyone has a spare computer with an excess of space, I'd recommend running GLIntercept on the game for upwards of a few days, just to squeeze out every last bit of texture data we can get.

EDIT: An unfortunate update, after about 8 hours of running GLIntercept, it crashed and dumped a ton of garbage data into my images directory. But at least I can confirm that I've gotten 5 uniquely numbered 8192^2 image sets started in the directory as well as a few other highish-res sets, so I imagine with some luck and a computer dedicated solely to running the process, we could potentially bruteforce the megatextures out of the game. But of course, it doesn't put us any closer to actually cracking the megatexture 2 format.

I'm interested in the models contained in the: ../cooked/model/models/mapobjects/prop/
Thanks in advance.

edit: correction, I tried with the original version of the game and all models show up correcly.

Nice, using RenderDoc in Vulkan mode actually works. You need a copy of the EXE that will run without steam, and you have to check the box "Ref all Resources" or it doesn't include the virtual textures in the Log.

Sadly, all of the 128x128 blocks are in randomized order, so putting those together will be  a real jigsaw puzzle. But it's a start.

Also I discovered the Virtual Texture Is stored as 3 'Slices', because it's 12 layers deep, and of course a texture can only be displayed 4 layers at a time (R,G,B,A).  

So while viewing the Virtual texture, save all 3 slices with the disk icon. and choose each slice with the Slice Dropdown.



Slice 0 is Diffuse, with half of the Normal Map in Alpha channel, 
Slice 1 is Specular, with the other half of the Normal Map in Alpha Channel,
Slice 2 is AO, and a few other misc 1 channel masks.

I'm wondering if the order of the blocks is directly related to the structure of the QuadTree...

Ok, so First off, you must set Doom to run in Vulkan API mode, instead of OpenGL.  This is done in Advanced settings of Doom game.
Also, as mentioned, your game must be cracked, so it runs without steam. because if Steam preloader is present, then RenderDoc can't hook in.



1.  Put in path to Doom Vulkan Executable.
2. Make sure Ref All Resources is Checked.
3 Press Capture to start the game.  

Once you get to a scene in the game with content you want to get textures for, Press F12.  That will capture the Frame.
(note that if you don't have an overlay as shown in the pic below, then RenderDoc isn't hooked in properly. This would usually mean your game isn't cracked.



Once you hit F12, the game will seem to freeze, but be patient, it's saving the Frame to disk. each frame is around 1 Gig of data or more, takes some time. You can take multiple frames, just be sure you have enough disk space.

after you exit the game, RenderDoc will still be running, with a screen showing all the frame you took (they call them logs). choose which log to view.



1. Switch to Texture Viewer.
2. Select Inputs tab.
3. Find a Colour Pass entry with large vkCmdDrawIndexed() calls (first parameter is data block size)  This is where major geometry is being rendered. Usually the virtualtexture will be present there. 



1. Select the VmtrphysicalPagesmap on that entry, and then you can access it's slices and save them as described above.

That's it.

might depend on what you set your quality settings to. I of course set it to ultra. and got the 16384 x 8192 textures as pictured.

Also don't be confused that each square is a texture, it's not. it's only 128x128 block of a texture. you have to find all the parts and re-arrange.  Mip-maps are also present in the top half of the image, which are very, very tiny versions of the whole texture. but of course those mipmaps should be ignored.

For example:


The block outlined on the right is a mipmap of the whole hand texture, so it's all fit into 128x128.

But the block outlined toward the center is most likely a small part of a finger of the same texture, but at full rez. you'd have to find all the parts and assemble them to make that original texture.

Also I should probably point out each block has 2 pixels of overlap from it's expected neighbors around the edge, the blocks are actually only 126x126

If you stitch two tiles together, they overlap by 8 pixels on each side. If someone can code a program to take this large sheet and auto-stitch the tiles by comparing those 8 pixels, that might work. For example, you can take tile A. You want to stitch a tile to the top of tile A. The program takes the 8 pixels on the top of tile A and it looks for 8 pixels on the bottom of every tile on the sheet that match. Then, it places those tiles together repeatedly until no more matches are found.

With every tile on the sheet though, this would take a very very long time. By hand, you can get some smaller mipmaps done pretty easily:

Why RenderDoс does not work, I ran it through Steam RIP as you said, but it was no use.

> Ok, so First off, you must set Doom to run in Vulkan API mode, instead of OpenGL.  This is done in Advanced settings of Doom game.
Also, as mentioned, your game must be cracked, so it runs without steam. because if Steam preloader is present, then RenderDoc can't hook in.



1.  Put in path to Doom Vulkan Executable.
2. Make sure Ref All Resources is Checked.
3 Press Capture to start the game.  

Once you get to a scene in the game with content you want to get textures for, Press F12.  That will capture the Frame.
(note that if you don't have an overlay as shown in the pic below, then RenderDoc isn't hooked in properly. This would usually mean your game isn't cracked.



Once you hit F12, the game will seem to freeze, but be patient, it's saving the Frame to disk. each frame is around 1 Gig of data or more, takes some time. You can take multiple frames, just be sure you have enough disk space.

after you exit the game, RenderDoc will still be running, with a screen showing all the frame you took (they call them logs). choose which log to view.



1. Switch to Texture Viewer.
2. Select Inputs tab.
3. Find a Colour Pass entry with large vkCmdDrawIndexed() calls (first parameter is data block size)  This is where major geometry is being rendered. Usually the virtualtexture will be present there. 



1. Select the VmtrphysicalPagesmap on that entry, and then you can access it's slices and save them as described above.

That's it.
I ran the game 'Justice online' but failed. But ninjaripper was able to run, did I do the wrong thing?
