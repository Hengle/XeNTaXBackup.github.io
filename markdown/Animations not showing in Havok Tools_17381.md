- Post Title: Animations not showing in Havok Tools

Hello...So I have been testing some animations from Dark Souls games but for some reason, the skeleton does load but when putting the animation, it doesn't play anything.
I have uploaded a sample animation with its skeleton. The Havok version is 2014.1.0-r1 64-bit.
