- Post Title: Sudden Strike 3 .psy

Hello,

I did have a topic on game archive discussion, but perhaps this fits this discussion better.

Recently been playing around with Sudden Strike 3, an old favourite of mine. The game had its own tools to import and deal with modelling, but not for particle systems. Does someone now how to work with these files, or if there is any possibility at all to do so? I'll attach examples. Any help is appreciated.

The extension .psy is not allowed to be uploaded, I used a zip file that contains a folder with 2 files.
