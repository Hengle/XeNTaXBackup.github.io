- Post Title: Cyclones

I was wondering if there is any plans for including Cyclones support in MultiEX?

It's an old FPS by Raven software, and I was looking to rip some graphics and sound out of it when I realised there was no support in MultiEx.   So I did a search to see if there was any utilities for Cyclones and came up with nothing.

The game is [here](http://www.the-underdogs.org/game.php?id=1480).


Thanks in advance, whatever your response :)

Downloading the game as we speak. Will get to it. It's now on the request (to-do) list.
