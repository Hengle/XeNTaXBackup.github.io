- Post Title: Unpack Octopath Traveler (Switch)

The whole game is a .pak file after extracting the RomFS. Where I am getting stuck is the sprites are all garbled (large box with pixels thrown everywhere) after I unpack the .pak with quickbms. Anyone have any ideas? Would just like to be able to extract the spritesheets.

EDIT: It may not be the file that is bad actually. I can only see the garbled images in umodel. Is there another program that will allow you to see the 2d sprites instead?

Maybe try this [viewtopic.php?f=33&t=15540](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=33&t=15540)

Thank you for the suggestion. But, none of these seem to be able to do it. All the files are .uexp and .uassest

When you used Quickbms to extract the .Pak file for Octopath, did you need a script? I'm also trying to modify the sprites, but i can't seem to get into the .Pak file

This tool can convert UE4 Switch DXT5 and RBGA textures in both ways, but if you want to convert it to be readable by game, then it's getting little complicated, espiecially for small textures (height below 128).

And about repacking pak files

How to untile texture:
Copy assets (uasset + uexp) to noesis folder. Drop *.uasset file ready for untiling to "Unswizzle.cmd". It will create PNG with the same name.

Will this also work for the Steam version?

PC Textures are not tiled, so you don't need Noesis, you can use UEViewer for unpacking Textures.

In case of pak tutorial - yes, because Octopath on PC is not encrypted.
