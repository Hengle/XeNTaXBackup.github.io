Im trying to extract the contents of a Cod WaW .edat and .pak files. ive used tools to make it a .dat file but i cant do anythong from there. Im just trying to make a small custom zombies map for World at war on ps3, i have already made a custom loading screen for the map, but... I need to see what is inside the .edat and .pak files in order to make the map. Mainlt the .pak file though.
Here is a link - [http://www.mediafire.com/file/wiq9vfe5h](http://www.mediafire.com/file/wiq9vfe5h) ... lC%203.zip
if someone could make a quickbms or something like that extractor for this, it would be amazing, thanks everyone and have a great day!!!
Im mainly trying to get the .pak extracted and a quickbms script could really help!!!
Once I get the .pak extracted i should be able to get custom zombies!!!
