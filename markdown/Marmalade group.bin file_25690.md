- Post Title: Marmalade group.bin file

Hey! So I found this post [viewtopic.php?t=13652](https://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?t=13652) talking about extracting an image from a group.bin file made with the Marmalade game engine. It looks like the user used "texturefinder 2.1" to do it, but where can I find it? It doesn't seem to be available anymore. I tried downloading it from some random website but my antivirus flagged it and deleted it.
