- Post Title: [iOS|Android] Cinderella Free Fall

Is anyone else here thinking about ripping assets and stuff from this game? The game's free-to-play (not to mention that it runs on Unity), but let me know if you just need the meshes and whatnot.

And yeah, I'm thinking about this in response to Frozen Free Fall being ripped and exploited last year, and I'm sure we all know what happened afterwards; that is, if you get my drift. 

EDIT: Yep, it works on Chip's Unity assets tool, see [this](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=11095&start=180) for details.
