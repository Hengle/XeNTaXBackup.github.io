Can you make it so when a user first registers then can only do one post per day for x days this would help a lot on the spam problem i think.

Having access to a batch post delete tool would be nice as well. Currently, I have to view, and delete, each individual post after banning the bots. Or perhaps I'm managing to overlook something, in spite of looking really hard all over the place multiple times?
