I have included the start and ending of the archive. I don't think its encrypted like read dead redemption since xma data is plain in clear sight. So maybe a script to parse this archive?

Please, tell me, how can I create new archive? I'm clicking on icon for new archive (I tried also combination Ctrl+N) but nothing...
Thank you for help. There is no way to add new file to existing archive as replace file with edited one.

What about models? Is it possible to extract and modify it in 3ds max for example?
