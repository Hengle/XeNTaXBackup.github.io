Hi,

I found the aes key, however this game is hybrid between UE4 -> UE5. Some of the functions has been ported from UE5 to UE4 and this comes with some changes. This game has ucas, utoc and sig files. I can unpack PAK files withour any issue, but it contains only fonts and part of the localization, like Menu, actions, etc. I goal is to get all dialogs from game, so i need to unpack ucas files, yes i know they are pared with pak files, but i cannot get any data from them by usuall methods. Any help you move me forward. Thx

AES key: 

```
0x1958456F8B54A02D25DF32327C57C9D20DFCF7E948967D08CFB48E8EBC65BEEB
