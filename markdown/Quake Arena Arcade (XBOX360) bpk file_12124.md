- Post Title: Quake Arena Arcade (XBOX360) bpk file

I recently got its files in a hope to extract their content and port it to the PC.
However, i got stuck in this bpk files (Which seems to be XBox's equivalent to our PK3s files).

Here's the download for the file: [https://mega.co.nz/#!kJ0UXKBI!zI5cpBL84 ... rOZxSUqp2o](https://mega.co.nz/#!kJ0UXKBI!zI5cpBL84JKsyyRS81eexRgwVXY6R6ACArOZxSUqp2o)

Im pretty sure it can be a different offset zip (or something releated to BluePoint Packages, i dunno)
