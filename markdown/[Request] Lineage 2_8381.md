- Post Title: [Request] Lineage 2

Hello to all, ok let me explain some tips to not confuse things, first of all for people who work with lineage2, know that the animations encryption are Lineage1.1.1  at the beginning of the file when you open with a hex editor, well now someone created a tool which changes entire file, in my example as I said before the encryption is passed Lineage1.1.1 but this tool did what it does is change it to Lineage8.1.1 for example, is something like encryption XOR , but not sure so I leave to experts to see if it is possible to reverse the file and return the bytes back to extract the file oh, ok I would appreciate very much, well thank you very much and have a good day.

So this isn't a file from lineage 2 I'm guessing.
The title would be misleading.
