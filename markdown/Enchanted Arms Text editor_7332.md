That looks like straight Unicode to me. Try opening the file in a text editor.

There should be an option to manually specify the encoding to use; try setting it to UTF-16.

I should've paid more attention to the filename. The file is an archive, so you'll have to extract the text files before you can edit them. For that, you'll need someone to reverse the format and write a QuickBMS script or similar.
