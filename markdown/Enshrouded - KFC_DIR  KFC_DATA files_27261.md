- Post Title: Enshrouded - KFC_DIR / KFC_DATA files

Hey,

looking for help for Enshrouded. Its available right now, during the Steam Fest. Demo gets removed on October 22th.

It uses: enshrouded.kfc_dir / enshrouded.kfc_data 

Same Format as Portal Knights.

[https://www.file-upload.net/en/download ... c_dir.html](https://www.file-upload.net/en/download-15194191/enshrouded.kfc_dir.html)

DIR File, the kfc_data is 30 GB, can upload it on request, or you just grab the Demo real quick from Steam.

There are no tools for those files. Also "kfc_dir" index file seems to be encrypted.
