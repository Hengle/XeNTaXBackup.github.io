- Post Title: .ca2 files for forza motorsports (xbox)

I don't have game extractor... yet. Should I get game extractor? Will it be able to edit the files within the .CA2? 

But anyways, I was looking for a command line program so I could decompress/compress the zlib compressed .ca2 files correctly. The other file to do this I found on here wasn't specific on usage, plus it was in german. If someone could send me an .exe program that would be awesome. I already looked up the file notes for the .ca2 file on the wiki. I'm just hope I'll be able to edit the .xml files within the cars.ca2 and recompress and put the file back onto the xbox and test the game out.

Help is appreciated.
