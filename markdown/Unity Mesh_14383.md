I'm having trouble opening these files in a 3D animation software. Moreover, I can't export nor preview these in softwares gathered from various sites especially this. Can someone help me make these an editable mesh? [.43 files](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/ams63ftllguk8d1/AABrafGUDel1oEQMdPyONDXka?dl=0)

Or you could use Unity Studio which now has the capability of exporting models in .fbx format WITH their bones and rigging in tact. [viewtopic.php?f=10&t=11807](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=11807)

It works pretty good most of the time. There are some cases where the model will export without the skinning, or stuck in an animation pose, however, so it's not perfect just yet, but it gets the job done.
