- Post Title: Thomas and Friends Graphics (OXY, GAS)

Hello,
Here are some graphic files used by Minds Eye production Thomas and Friends games in the late 90s early 2000s. I believe the .gas files are just compressed tgas because a .gsf file mentions a complete list of tgas that should be in the gas at compile time. I have no idea what oxy files are, I couldn't figure anything out on them. 

Here are some samples:

If anyone is able to figure them out I greatly appreciate it!
Regards,
Tomix
