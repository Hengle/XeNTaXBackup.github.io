- Post Title: SD Gundam G Generation World

Starting on a translation of G Generation into English. Need a wee bit of help though. When trying to open up the main DATAUMD.CPK file I always get TOC (or lack off) errors using any of the CPK programs. I can see the file has an ITOC and where the ITOC starts and ends. However I can't figure out how to tell QuickBMS or UTF_Tab how to use said ITOC. Of course if I'm wrong entirely someone do let me know.
Also said folder contains a Filelist.bin which I suspect may be an external TOC. However I certainly hope not.
