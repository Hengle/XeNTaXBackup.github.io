This table shows which image types are currently supported 
[https://github.com/bartlomiejduda/EA-Gr ... port-table](https://github.com/bartlomiejduda/EA-Graphics-Manager#image-formats-support-table)

According to my research, these types occurs mostly in PS2 games,
here are some example games with that types [https://imgur.com/a/fkSH85T](https://imgur.com/a/fkSH85T)
I've also worked with some PS1 games like NBA Live 97 or FIFA 2000.


I plan to support some PSP/XBOX/PC games in the future

that's not my answer I was looking for, but I was looking for the game titles (like fifa, nhl or nba etc) that is supported by this. and I thought this tool was for Classic Era NFS games (1994-2000) for ps1 and pc that also uses fsh image file extensions.

EDIT: asking this bcuz I sent the github link to nfs modding servers I joined and some people asking to which game is this tool for.

btw I totally forgot that some fsh image file for older nfs games are packed as qfs bundles. probably needs to be converted with this tool: [https://www.nfscars.net/need-for-speed- ... view/5298/](https://www.nfscars.net/need-for-speed-high-stakes/2/files/view/5298/)

I may be creating a new topic about classic nfs games assets for modding purposes

I've updated the table [https://github.com/bartlomiejduda/EA-Gr ... port-table](https://github.com/bartlomiejduda/EA-Graphics-Manager#image-formats-support-table)
Hope it answers your question now.
