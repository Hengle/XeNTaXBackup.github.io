So i'm trying to cook up a quickbms / or (some other type of script) that could take my textures header ".XETU" and spit out the file 100% unmodified except i need the header replaced with ".XETV"   [one single byte change]

This can be done with HEX manually yes, but i have over 1000+ textures i need to header replace, so you can imagine the issue here...

How would i go about this?


Sorry if this is in the wrong place.
