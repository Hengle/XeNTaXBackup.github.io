For another approch, I think if there is no way for unpacking the file, Is it possible that we capture unpacked data from memory(RAM) when game is running?

I looked at it in my hex editor, and I can see literal text.  Doesn't look encrypted to me.
You right, The file is a structured binary file.   
However , problem is that how can i found structure of the file ? In the following thread there are some try from other users but seems that didn't complete yet !

Thank you for your attention.
