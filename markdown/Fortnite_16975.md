Hey, did anyone try to unpack the pak files from Fortnite From Epic Games?

It looks like it is using Unreal 4.
[https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/blog ... l-engine-4](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/blog/building-fortnite-with-unreal-engine-4)

Can someone tell me how to unpack them ?

Tnx x 1000

Ok I found this script here, [http://aluigi.altervista.org/bms/unreal ... ment_4.bms](http://aluigi.altervista.org/bms/unreal_tournament_4.bms)

it seems to do the trick on the FortniteGame-Windows.pak file which is 13GB

... extracting

according to Gildor, this game is using a non standard version of the unreal engine. he said he would look into adding support for it in UE Viewer when Fortnite gets closer to release.

It worked on an earlyer 2017 version, you can still find it out there.

I'm trying to load the map itself and export to make a topographic map of the whole region. Anybody has some tips or maybe help me build a tiff file to work with?
