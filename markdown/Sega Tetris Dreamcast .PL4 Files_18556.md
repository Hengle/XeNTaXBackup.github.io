- Post Title: Sega Tetris Dreamcast .PL4 Files

the format of this game seems to be a weird one, as by looking in it via a hex editor, it seems that it's it own custom format. same with the textures. i have tried numerous attempts to figure out how to get the models. ninjaripper didnt work, and using the noesis scripts for pvm files/pvr files (which is what most dreamcast games use and it even has pvr files in the directory) didnt work either. in the file attached is what i believe to be all the files relating to the pl4 file, for its textures and another file i dont know the purpose of, but its under the same name.
