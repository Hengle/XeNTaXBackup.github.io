I've been trying to extract the sound files from this game for some time. I've thrown every .fsb tool and program at it I could possibly find to no avail. I'm guessing it uses OGG Vorbis files and the header can't be read properly by generic extractors, so that basically leaves me completely lost. Anyone mind taking a look at a file to see if there's anything that can be done?

If its FSB truly, its encrypted or else obfuscated clearly thus most tools no doubt fail. Don't recall if the newer encryption was cracked or not.
