HI 
I want to edit 3d models from games liek MotoGP 15/RIDE etc.. by Milestone
They are using BIN files but I don´t know how to get 3d files from them and also how to extract to BIN then to use it in-game. 
Any suggestions ?? 
Thanks .. 
I´m using 3ds Max 2017. Is there some plugin to do that ??

"State of art" getting models in obj format  from Ride is using Ninja Ripper.

Because of that I've stopped my investigations here:
