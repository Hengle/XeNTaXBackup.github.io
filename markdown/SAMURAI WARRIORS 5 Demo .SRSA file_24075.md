- Post Title: SAMURAI WARRIORS 5 Demo .SRSA file

I open the file in a hex editor and delete the first 16 bytes save the new file with the extension of .ktsl2asbin.and trying to play the audio file with foobar2000 using the vgmstream plugin, but they don't work.
how it would be possible to get the sounds inside?
