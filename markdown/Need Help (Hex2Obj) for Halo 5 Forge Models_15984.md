- Post Title: Need Help (Hex2Obj) for Halo 5 Forge Models

So guys, I'm new at these things. I'll be honest, I just want halo 5 armors for my SFM project. I found Halo 5: Forge models in this forum, I tried to open them in 3DSMax but I can't. I learned I need to convert these files to .obj. My English is not very good at this point and I understand nothing. Could someone explain how I do things with Hex2Obj and convert them into .obj. And if it's possible, could you teach me how can I use them in Source Filmmaker?

Here's a script from erik945 (didn't test it):

> My English is not very good at this point and I understand nothing.Use google translation. Should be understandable in most cases.

> Could someone explain how I do things with Hex2Obj and convert them into .obj.The version of hex2obj which works for those models is on hold atm, because I'm too busy with a myriad of other things.
