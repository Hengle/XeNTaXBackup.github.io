- Post Title: Decode old ealayer audio file

Hey,
I've attempted to rip the song files from Fifa Football for the PS Vita (should act the same as sound files from Fifa 12), but current Zenchreal's ealayer v0.5.0 and 0.7.0 seem to not work, giving an error along the lines of "Unrecognized File Format" (Can't confirm as I'm currently on a linux laptop, away from my windows PC), so I'm bound to think that the issue is that the codec since evolved and rendered incompatible with older file formats. Does anyone have a backup of the tools used at the time I can have to test it out?
