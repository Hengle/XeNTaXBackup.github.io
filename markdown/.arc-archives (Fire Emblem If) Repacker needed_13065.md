- Post Title: .arc-archives (Fire Emblem If) Repacker needed

Hey Guys,

I want to edit/create .arc-archives for Fire Emblem If (Nintendo 3DS).
They're a bit different than the .arc-archives from other games. 
I'm not able to open/edit them with EveryFileExplorer.

There's already a tool to extract this files ([FEAT](https://github.com/SciresM/FEAT)) but this tool can't repack this files.

I'll upload one of this .arc-files, possibly someone could help me with this (would be awesome!)

I just want to edit the bch.lz files which are inside of this archive to use them Ingame.


THank you for your help!

come on, boy! Tell us the whole truth.  

Your request consists of at least three tasks, doesn't it?
o pack *.png as *.bch 
o compress *.bch to *.bch.lz
o pack the lz files into an *.arc archive

I found that there's an lz compression inside the source code but seems it's used on text files only.

1) what was your research so far?
2) did you ask the author for an update? (It's very unlikely that someone else will dig into the code.)

I'm able to pack the *.png to *.bch already  (using Ohana3DS for it).
I can compress the *.bch to *.bch.lz already  (using DSDecmp.exe for it "DSDecmp.exe -c lz11 "File.bch")
The only problem is: I'm not able to repack the .arc-archive again with the modified files :\

2) Yea, I asked the Author already but he has no plans to add this feature at the moment...

thx for clearifying!
In my experience it's somewhat harder to pack than to unpack an archive.
Guess you've searched for a similar type of archive and didn't find any?

I guess this .arc-file type is similar to another .arc-filetypes that can be opened with EveryFileExplorer.
I tried to open this file with EFE but it does not work.
I've tried every .arc-tool but none of them worked.
Yes, I've searched for a similar type of archive^^

```

For the .darc-files, I've a tool already to replace files in it (does not work on this .arc-files)

3A 58 01 00 = Filesize?
54 57 01 00 = MetaOffset?
07 00 00 00 0A 00 00 00 = always 07 00 00 00 0A 00 00 00

Tool has been providen to ChrisX930 and the Fire Emblem If Translation team by me.
If the mods aren't released in 3 month I'll publish the source. Other wise the source will be released the day the mods will be available.

If you have any necessity of it please contact me on skype or in pm

Thanks for sharing this but unfortunately this didn't seem to work properly, as it wasn't processing the entire directory along with subdirectories and files inside them.
A friend of mine had a look at the source code and modified it to actually work, a few pointers were apparently wrong as well.
I'm attaching the modified source and compiled exe, the modified code has comments as to what was wrong.

There is however one problem my friend was unable to solve, some of the arc achives (at least all the DLC ones) seem to have some sort of verification for the files at the end of the file.
It seems like some sort of hash check that ends with "TFRC" at the end, in all of them. My friend was unable to figure it out so the modified tool I attached won't work for arc archives with that TFRC stuff but for others it should work nice and dandy.
If anyone is interested in trying to figure out the TFRC check thingy, here's a few sample files, look at the last 12 bytes:
