- Post Title: Extracting package.rdp from God Eater Vita games

So, 4 years or more ago there was someone who was trying to make a Undub version of Vita God Eater games, the game halted at almost 80% of the audio voices undubbed (swapped the JAP game voices to the USA game files) I'm trying to retake that project but afaik they needed a tool to extract/repack the package.RDP without file loss. I'm in need of help to finish that project. If anyone knows something, all info is appreciated.

You can upload RDP sample to some hosting like google drive or mega.nz and someone may check your file and help you with this.
