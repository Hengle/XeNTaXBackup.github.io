- Post Title: The Neverhood .blb repacker

Since we have come a long way in being able to extract the sounds, sprites/images and videos from the game The Neverhood that are stored in simple .blb formats, the following question arises, has anyone been able to create a simple compressor to repack these blb files back to their original format? Modding for The Neverhood would be a huge step next to finding out how the blb headers worked.
