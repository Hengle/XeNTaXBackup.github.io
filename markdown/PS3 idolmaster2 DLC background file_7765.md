- Post Title: PS3 idolmaster2 DLC background file

I extract the background file from the first DLC, although it has a ".jpg" extension, it absolutely can not be opened normaly.
When I try to use gtf2dds(official tools) to convert it, "PackedGtf" information is given, so I think it's a special packed format? But I have no clue to convert it to normal dds or bmp, jpg...etc.
Hope anyone can help me out with it?

attach the file link

So..Packed Gtf means it is an encrypted GTF format and impossible to convert to DDS straightly?
