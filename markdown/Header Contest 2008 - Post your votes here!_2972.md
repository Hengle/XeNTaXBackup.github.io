Too many "specialized" logos for my taste (what's Xentax's connection to EA again?). Also, many of the fonts are simply unreadable. I prefer something simple, yet stylish, and not too overloaded. So here are my votes:

1.   26 (simple and technical. my favorite)
2.   23 (has a nice'n'easy logo to identify everything with)
3.     4 (keeps the well-known XeNTaX caption, although a unique new logo would be cool on this one)

> I would include 10, but I think it has to many Nintendo character.

Ditto, but I'm going to include it anyway simply because it's the best design - just replace the characters with a better variety (some from Xbox, PS, and an exclusively PC character too).

Votes in order best first:
1. (10), 2. (35), 3. (22)

I know they said vote, not review but..... too late now...
10: too much Nintendo (there seems to be a lot of nintendo nuts on these submissions....), I'd prefer the "XENTAX" and the "Game Research Forum" be in the same font style - ie both flat or both beveled, get rid of the stripes in the background.

35: increase the font size, make the right graphic less busy and more distinguished, add a bit more variety in terms of consoles and genres.

22: They said vote for 3.... This one's too busy but otherwise decent. Too many FPS characters, not enough variety from different genres or consoles.

If I may make a suggestion, we could always set up a rotation or random selection, allowing us to use more than one banner... But then, I suppose that doesn't actually have much to do with this contest, does it?

Very well, with our votes, this was closed. 

The scoring system:

1. We'll count 3 points for 1st, 2 for 2nd and 1 for third, to get the points distributed per header. 

2. The number of 'gold' medals is however of influence, thus there is a bonus score: The total number of first places per entry times is multiplied with the points distributed and this score is added to the points distributed to get the final score. We feel that being voted first choice should weigh heavy on the total score. 

3. This means that if you have a lot of gold medals but not so many 2nd or 3rd, you should still be able to outvote others that have less gold medals, but more 2nd or 3rd. On the other hand, if you have some gold medals and in addition a lot of "secondary" points, the multiplication of the medals with the total points that were distributed to you should still enable you to beat the ones with more gold medals. Geddit? 

This way, the final standing is: 




Header 4 wins the contest! It is of interest to note that header 7 also is in the top 10, placing 6th. Voters like the basic concept of headers 4 to 7, apparently. 1 has just lost out, gaining a lot of secondary votes as well. Finally, header 22 takes the third place. 

So, with the authors names:

1. Blue Ninja
2. Andrei155
3. Steven Gerritse


We like the idea forwarded that we could create a number of forum themes to choose from, with different headers. I'm not saying we will do that, but we might. Also, we feel that a number of headers are quite excellent, even if they did not win any prize, and we may still use them at some point. 

In the coming week(s) we will handle the matter of the prize money, and putting up Header number 4 (or 7) in cooperation with Blue Ninja. Congrats to all winners, and there are some real gems there that just missed out ! Thanks everyone for participating and see you perhaps next time!

I've noticed, it looks pretty nice  (though it *is* admittedly somewhat annoying seeing it stretch this 800x600 res out horizontally =P ).

Hehe, well, be proud that you are among the bottom 4% that has less than 1024x768 res  !

It ain't me, it's the library, I swear! On the upshot, they're getting (sort of) new computers, and the ones they have are getting upgraded/updated, so hopefully, no more 800x600 res's. *crosses fingers*
