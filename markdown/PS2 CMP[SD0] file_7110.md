are there any other file types in this game?
it might make it easier to find the compression.

I used AFS Explorer to open the AFS files
*.bd
*.adx   - audio file
*.cmp
*.CMP
*.hd
*.sfd   - video file
I'd like help to from you.

it might be using the renderware compression. I can try the max script i have a little later when i am hom eon it to see what happens. the closest compression in quickbms seems to be COMP_PUYO_LZSS.
So there is a chance its the unsupported in quickbms renderware compression.
