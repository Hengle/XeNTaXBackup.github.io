Yeah I did. The encryption scheme seems to be different between the two.. That tool can't open the PS3 save files, and while it does "try" to decrypt the PS3 version, it basically just spits out a garbled mess as a result. There's a few things I'm curious about in the save file, namely how character and monster data is stored. From research I've seen of the 360 format, people have been successful adding characters and monsters to their party that are otherwise not normally accessible in the game..

Actually hacking the save to accomplish this would be trivial enough for me, but the encryption scheme? Not my field. As I said I wouldn't be surprised if this is a lost cause, as in my experience the PS3 can be pretty irritating in this regard.. but I figured I'd throw it up here as an inquiry anyway, just in case anyone has any insight or ideas about it.
