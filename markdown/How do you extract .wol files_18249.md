- Post Title: How do you extract .wol files?

Hi I am currently working on a rabbids go home remake project ( Progress Can be found here: [https://plus.google.com/collection/sPTJUF](https://plus.google.com/collection/sPTJUF)) and i stepped upon this file with a file extension called ".wog", It has multiple files like... CREDITS.WOG D4.WOG C12.WOG etc. I've attached pictures so you can see these files Does anyone else know how to extract it? I even searched it up and it just gave me a .wag file. Please note that this is a ubisoft game and it could be a special file extension for the ubisoft games
