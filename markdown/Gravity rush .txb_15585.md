Just a quick question: Have you already checked if the game accepts modified txb files?
For example, the first string in Ingame_CM_Datafile1_EN.txb is "Defeat as many Nevi as possible using only gravity throws!".
Could you please open the file in a hex editor, change a few characters and check if the game displays the modified text?
