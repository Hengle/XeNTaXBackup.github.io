Hello, i was wondering if there is a way to rip textures/models from Star Stable online? It is working under OpenGL. Unfortunately Ripping Ninja doesn't work on this mmo game (with launcher). Is there a way to rip the files with another program? ty

You can open the Star Stable Online .pme files using the following programs:

- 3D Object Converter v7.027 (Windows)
- i3DConverter v3.704 (macOS)
- i3DConverter v1.704 (Linux)

How to get the 3D Object Converter:
Download the 3D Object Converter from [ http://3doc.i3dconverter.com](http://3doc.i3dconverter.com) and install it or download and use the portable version.
After it just use the Help/Check for updates... function to get the v7.027.

How to get the i3DConverter macOS:
Download the i3DConverter from [ http://www.i3dconverter.com](http://www.i3dconverter.com) and install it.

I have a data.zip file from 2016. It has 15739 files (.pte, .pme files).
I don't remember where these files came from.
