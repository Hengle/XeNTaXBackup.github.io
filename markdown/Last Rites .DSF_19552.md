Here's a decoder for Last Rites .DSF music
Its a questionable quality 1997 dos game, but music is remarkable

Great job, I tried to achieve the same thing a while ago to no avail 
Would you mind sharing the source code as well? I have a project on hold consisting in reversing the game's file formats which I should pick up again sooner or later, and this would definitely come in handy (of course you'd get credited for this, I'm not the kind of person who rides someone else's accomplishments).
