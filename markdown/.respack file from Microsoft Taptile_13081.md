- Post Title: .respack file from Microsoft Taptile

I have a ".respack" file from Windows 8.1's game(Metro/Modern App) "Taptile" named "origins.respack". And I think there is a BGM music in it, but I don't know how to "extract" it.

I'v tried dump the whole memory of the running Taptile to a dumpfile and use hyperrip to search it, but no lucky, can't find the BGM.
Anyone have any idea ?
