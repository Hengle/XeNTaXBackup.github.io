I extracted the sound from StreamsMulti.pck with [AlphaTwentyThree](http://forum.xentax.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&u=12602)'s [WAVE format scanner](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=13&p=74664#p74664), [ww2ogg](http://hcs64.com/vgm_ripping.html) (using included packed_codebooks_aoTuV_603.bin) and [revorb](http://yirkha.fud.cz/progs/foobar2000/revorb.exe).
