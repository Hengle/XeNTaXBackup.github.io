- Post Title: Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance SSF Files

Hi There,

I have been trying to find a way to extract the 2D textures from Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance a came that came out in 2002. I have tried everything known to man. I sent an email to aluigi but he seems pretty busy and said these SSF archive files look tough. Can anyone help me with them? I was able to extract all the .ssf files from the PS2 MK:DA.PAK file -OR- I can give you the .ssf file from the xbox version as the xbox version does not archive them into MK:DA.pak. And if you really want I can give you the Gamecube version of the .ssf file. I have attached 2 files any help would be greatly appriciated.

As you can see this .ssf graphics file archive is differant for all the consoles. Xbox, PS2 and Gamecube. (149.17 KiB) Downloaded 37 times

Ok so I asked someone who knows alot about BMS scripts about this and he was able to whip up a bms script that extracts the .ssf archives (ps2)
now I have files with this type of header, anyone recognize it? The game uses Renderware. 

```
"             ÿÿ PS2 "
```
 <- Larger file

```
" €            ÿÿ PS2 "
```
 <- Smaller File

Usally the way MK works is the larger images are split into to usally 512x256 and 256x256. So thats how it looks above
