Dragon Quest XI (11) map tool

Usage is similar to IJ2 maps
First process all "Environments" folders, it will create a lot of staticmesh.RAW files.
Then use .UMAP with the tool

notes:
- not all map data will be supported. There are many ways in UE3/UE4 to add static mesh, i only support most obsious now. Also no skeletal (moving) meshes and no foliage.
- some meshes have too many UV pairs, this increases size. Some of them are not ever real UVs, just some data stored in UV buffer part, no idea what is that.

Do you recall the name of the folder of that town in the picture you posted?
I'm interested in extracting that one.

I've written up a list of many of the locations as I've been finding them, but there are still a huge number missing, if other people could also note down whats what, that'd be really helpful in compiling a full list of locations.

I've marked the stage you're specifically after.
