- Post Title: X3 ModManager

This program is now obsolete. Use X3 Edtitor 2 which has the same capabilities.

X3 ModManager is program for managing Catalog files (CATs) and Packed Files (PCKs/PBDs/PBBs) used by the games X3 Reunion and X3 Terran Conflict.

(It can as well be used with X:BtF and X2 The Threat)

Features:

    list content of catalogs
    extract selected files from catalogs or extract whole catalogs (normally or with drag & drop)
    delete files from catalogs
    add files and directories to catalogs (normally or with drag & drop)
    overwrite files in catalogs
    display information about files in catalogs such as size (packed and original) and time of last modification
    view files in catalogs via external file viewer/editor
