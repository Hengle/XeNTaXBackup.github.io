Here is the Yuke's model converter.
3ds max script for max 9 or higher
you will need the endian swap plugin for max.
[http://www.maxplugins.de/](http://www.maxplugins.de/)
here is the 2010 version 32 and 64 bit

here is the max 9 version 32 and 64 bit 'might work with 2008"

any version greater then 8 will work
there is an endian converter for each version of max.

I had version 7, but I can't even find that, but apparently it wouldn't work anyway.

Can you make something work with Blender?  It's free and open-source and has way less hardware requirements.

I just installed Blender and it's pretty damn good for free, is very small installation, and uses python scripts for plugins.  I am little bit familiar with that, so maybe looking at your plugin I can see if I can make it work in Blender.  The endianess of the files may be a problem though, but I'm gonna see if there is a similar endian plugin for Blender.

In python its easy to swap endian format. if you want to work on this together let me know I wanted to start coding for blender.

This is a dumb question but how do you use this script. i've selected Maxscript - run script, then what do I do? I'm using 3dsm 9.

There is a picture in the right corner.press it and it will show up.
The Yukes.ms seems to damaged.it detected lots of error.
I used winrar,7zip to decompress the file,both results are the same.
I fixed some places showing as'?' mark in the scripts ,it finally loads but  can't import any yobj object.
have message say'msh FN error'.
My system configuration:
Max 9.0 32bit.
Endian converter loaded.

You must download the endian plugin I mentioned in the first post.

the game contains rushed models. much like poser they use a single common mesh between all the girls 

even the textures are the same.. its a HUGE surprise. the diffuse maps are up in the 1024x*, although the main body normal is only 128x128.. its almost a shame to see how the developers abandoned RRXX last minute

you must run the script not open the script.
Also if you get an error the plugin did not load

here it is.

I fixed some lines from
f1 = ReadBEword f + 1??-read face indices, games are start form 0, but Max start from 1
f2 = ReadBEword f  + 1??-so we add 1 to each index


to

f1 = ReadBEword f + 1--read face indices, games are start form 0, but Max start from 1
f2 = ReadBEword f  + 1--so we add 1 to each index


And
msh = mesh vertices:Vert_array faces:Face_array??-build mesh
msh.numTVerts = UV_array.count
buildTVFaces msh
for j = 1 to UV_array.count??o setTVert?msh j UV_array[j]
for j = 1 to Face_array.count?o setTVFace msh j Face_array[j]
for j = 1 to Normal_array.count do setNormal msh j Normal_array[j]


I think this section is damaged something,,,i can't load yobj mesh,,how about your condition?

you do not need to edit anything 3ds max can be stupid when it wants to be.
you must run any other script then run this one.
just run this script then run the yobj importer it must initialize the plugin then it will work.

Is there anyway to import the ps2 version models into the 360 game? the model is also in yobj format but seems to be a slightly different format.

i dont think so bro because the ps2 has alot less polygons and lower resolution textures and the models themselves I believe are smaller than the next gen counterpart. the Model bone structure is prolly completely different as well. I would love to have all the htcp guys too though lol.

This is very frustrating. - NM, fixed the plug-in problem now.

Models are pretty interesting, textures are fantastic. Would love to get hold of bone, animation data. Perhaps one day, great work so far.

The textures look pretty awful in Max. In Photoshop, they are clearly great textures, wonder why they look so bad in Max renders.

Well chrrox i had set up a donation thread for the continued developement of this script that you created so that we could convert other models into svr 2010 compatible yobj files at caws.ws but the admins shut it down for whatever reason. I myself along with brienj and other memebers of the vr 2010 modding community would like to contribute towards that goal if you are interested in working on it. Just post here or pm me you paypal info and we will be more than happy to donate to this cause thanks for that youve done so far on this.

Well, considering this plugin was made for the Xbox 360 version, I'd say it wouldn't work.

You gets error because it's new version of .yobj format.

I need some help please.

I've injected Triple-H's hair into JBL's pac. The problem is that the hair on triple h maps to a different area on the colour map than JBL's and the hair gets the texture of JBL's boots. Anyne have any idea where the yobj stores coordinates for where it derives it's texture?
