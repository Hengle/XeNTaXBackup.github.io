- Post Title: Halo Spartan Strike BlueResourcePC_Windows files

Hello my friends, I am having trouble understanding this Archive. I am working with a modding community and we are hoping to extract the files from this game. So far I have only been able to find the magic which is xV4 and nothing else. Could someone take a look at this? I will include a link to the file and a screenshot of the beginning of the file. I did try to see if the file uses compression with Aluigi's compression tool but did not find anything that looked correct. I also did try to first find an existing script that deals with these files or files with the same magic but found nothing. Thank you for your time.

It seems that script for that game already exist [http://aluigi.altervista.org/bms/halo_s ... strike.bms](http://aluigi.altervista.org/bms/halo_spartan_strike.bms)

Also, data doesn't seem to be compressed. 
For example when you use tool like X-Ripper [https://www.instalki.pl/programy/downlo ... ipper.html](https://www.instalki.pl/programy/download/Windows/narzedzia_inne/X-Ripper.html)
you can get over 120 DDS files out of this archive.
