The contents of this post was deleted because of possible forum rules violation.




Update 2014-10-25:
- import smd model and animation
- convert gr2 (granny model) to smd
- import mdl models with skin skeleton and textures
- convert vtf images to tga format for mdl models

It works with Blender version 249 and Python version 2.6
