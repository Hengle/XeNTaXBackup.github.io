If I remember well ,acually there are no converters for that game and probably nobody will work on it.
The quality of these wii models is the same of wii Bleach versus crusade, which instead uses mdl0 format files.

So you have 2 options: a) u can ripp the models from B. shatter blade using dolphin + 3dvia printscreen or 3dripper dx
                                b) u can extract the models from the other wii bleach game.
