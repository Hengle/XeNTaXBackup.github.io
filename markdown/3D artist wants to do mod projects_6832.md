- Post Title: 3D artist wants to do mod projects

First of all, I'm new, hi everyone.

Alright, so I see that it's very complicated to extract and access files from pretty much all video games and I'm thinking maybe it's too complicated for me. Thing is, I study 3d animation and modeling and I've been wanting to create game mods. All I can do is probably edit meshes and textures so I'd like to know if there are people willing to send me character models for games they'd like to see modified. I would then send them the modified one so they can recompile it in the game.

I'm opened to all sorts of stuff like DBZ characters in Final Fantasy games to nude mods.

If anyone is interested, you can reply here or send me a pm.

I work with Maya. I also know some MotionBuilder but I doubt it would be useful unless we also get in animation editing (I'm still doing that course anyway, I got a lot to learn).

If you have files that are not originally compatible with Maya, I'd like links to the plugins please.

EDIT: The rules say no porn. Does nudity count as such?
