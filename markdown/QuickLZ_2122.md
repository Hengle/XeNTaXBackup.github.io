If normally you enter here maybe you know a lot of games ares compressed with the zlib library [http://www.zlib.net](http://www.zlib.net) and sometimes with lzo [http://www.oberhumer.com/opensource/lzo/](http://www.oberhumer.com/opensource/lzo/)

I found a new library compressor really hyper fast and with great compression it's QickzLZ and (thanks) it's under GPL License. 

Maybe the games will start to use this in a future?

I don't know   but why not be the first to try and play with this?

It certainly sounds interesting, but I have to agree with Rahly on this one.

New version of this program from  15-Mar-2007  v 1.20
Web site now it's:

I wonder about this:

> Compressed size  	 
>
> QuickLZ         Zlib 1.2.3
>
> 61.0%    	46.4%
and

> Compression in Mbyte/s

> QuickLZ         Zlib 1.2.3
>
> 144                   7.45

Still won't be used in games, as its a "per user license" which a software may never know.
