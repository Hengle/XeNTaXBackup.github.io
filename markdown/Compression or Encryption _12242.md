Looks encrypted file, because I was able to open a cas file in notepad and still see some file path info.  There is quite a few modders, myself included who'd love to see it done.

Someone over at the nexus found this:

What's interesting is it showed the default path for overriding game files.  Last two games used a similar file path of override folder instead of update lol.

I've also found that the wow addons use the same file format, though someone tried an unpacker called Tomrus and it didn't work.  So some how this cas file is different than the other existing ones.

It looks as though people were able to tweak some files and use the battlefield 4 tool to extract the audio files here:

Originally when I researched the cas and sb files, the cas seemed similar to java encoding like on android os lol.  Though I'm no expert on this. 

Either case id love to hear any progress you guys make.  If you need any file examples from me feel free to pm me.

Is this the same kind of cas format as bf4?  If so would a tool like process explorer or ninja ripper work?

Sorry for all the questions,  I just felt there was no need to start another thread when we are perhaps after the same things.  Thank you ^^

The only thing I've seen encrypted in Frostbite games was the .toc files.
