- Post Title: Unpack game Chu Liu Xiang 3D Unreal Engine

I have downloaded a game and the graphics are also very nice. The game is called Chu Liu Xiang or according to the website's name, it's called jianghu. It can be downloaded for Android, iOS, or PC versions. I downloaded the PC version and it's about 47Gb. After looking at the files I use a tool like Quickbms, umodel also doesn't know what file format it is with the extension 1, 5, 8.5,...blabla.
I downloaded a folder for everyone to see if there is a way to unzip this game. The folder I uploaded is randomly in the Patch folder, and I think the Patch folder is definitely the folder containing the game's resources. Hope someone can review and give some solutions to this game for me. Thanh you very much.
