I was gonna ask about this, you beat everyone to it though.

Anyone try existing CryEngine scripts/tools on the models/textures yet?

Good news, regular old noesis Cryengine script can open all the models just fine, with weights and all.

Anyone know where I can find the full client, and maybe we can get an updated version of the tool to unpack those version files?

Ah, so someone will have to come up with a new way to unpack the files. Hopefully the model format stays the same, since it comes out of Noesis with all weights and UVs intact.

It'll be nice to have some actually high res MH models, although MH4 Ultimate's models look pretty good in game though.

Suppose it would be good for anyone interested in poking at the files, although all that's really needed for someone to write a new unpacker is a single archive file. On the other hand since it's a F2P title the client will easily be downloadable once the final game releases.

So the CBT still used pak? Can the tool unpack them? If so I wouldn't mind taking a peek at some of the models and textures, since from what I saw a lot of it is second gen stuff.

Yep the CBT is all .pak files. The tool does not extract them though sadly.

That's a shame, hopefully the OP sees the samples you linked above and updates the tool. 

I hope they bring the game out in the states as well or at least don't block non-asian IPs.

I bet they won't release it near future. Still no news about any Beta etc. in China. Only a local test appeared.

Well hopefully it's not to hard to figure out what to do to unpack it. What was available in the benchmark alone was really high quality, so I hope it'll be possible to extract the stuff from the full game when it finally drops.

What was available in the benchmark alone was really high quality, so I hope it'll be possible to extract the stuff from the full game when it finally drops.how I say before, the full game use ifs format, and for now only can unpack files without file names and with wrong extentions, so no usefull at all.
