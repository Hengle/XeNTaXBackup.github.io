Hi! Somebody already understood the structure of the ZTR-files?
Seems to be used a variation of the LZ.



Thanks!

I also have interest in (* .ZTR Import And Export). Could you attach one to your topical ZTR file? So easy for someone who is interested in doing only tool without having the game.

I don't think it is compressed. Apparently there are two duplicate words of "You" in less than two lines, which proves a lot.
It is just modifiers, I guess, that are scattered among the text.

Can someone compile the project for us? I've tried here in visual studio 2013 but once compiled is giving error. I think I'm doing something wrong. Quam know how to do, is there and put here for us.

Tks
