- Post Title: Goldeneye Rogue Agent Gamecube Models

Hi everyone, this might be weird but I don't suppose anyone's heard of Goldeneye Rogue Agent? Don't sweat if you haven't. But either way, there are some models in this game like Xenia Onatopp from Goldeneye itself that I'd love to acquire. A user named Dave on the Xentax discord wrote a BMS script to extract from the files of the gamecube iso itself. The file system structure has all .viv files like "level.viv" and such. 

I made a .rar file of the bms script and some file samples I extracted using the bms script here:

Hopefully someone can make something of this, would be very much appreciated to look into games like these and Agent Under Fire etc. nowadays.
