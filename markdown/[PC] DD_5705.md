This utility searchs for differences between the two given folders and copies a different or absent files to standalone folder.

Example 1:
DD FirstDir SecondDir OutDir
will copy files from FirstDir in case they're absent in SecondDir or in case they're different

Example 2:
DD FirstDir SecondDir OutDir -69
will copy files from FirstDir in case they're absent in SecondDir or in case they're different, but will also copy the files from SecondDir which are absent in FirstDir

So, if you will pack the OutDir by following the Example 1 - then we will get the patch for SeconDir, which, after unpacking into it, will make it the exact copy of the FirstDir.

Enjoy it

Interesting. That could prove handy for the Batch functionality in MultiEx Commander.
