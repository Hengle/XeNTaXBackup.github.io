- Post Title: [PS2] Metal Gear Solid 3 Subsistence (Find text files)

Hello friends, I'm new to this forum and I need your help. Let me introduce myself, my name is William Rocha, I live in Brazil. I’m a big fan of the MGS series and I’ve been dedicating a lot of time in translating the MGS3 Subsistence to brazilian portuguese.
 Some days ago, I was snooping around the files from the game on my PC and with a hex editor and I’ve been able to find the files containing the cutscenes captions, briefing files captions, and the captions displayed during the game, such as "HQ, we need backup", etc..  There are 5 languages inside the files, but only 2 are available on the game: “English” and “Spanish” but my language: “brazilian portugue” is not included, nor as an option in the game, nor any of those five, so my idea was to replace the spanish language by the portuguse. I maneged to translate some cutscenes as a test and it worked fine, and not only that, I've been able to identify the necessary accents too.

Well, let me explains the problem, and how the game is divided:
(I’m a noob comparing with you guys, so I could make some mistakes, not only in programing but in my english too   )

*each file is a .dat file:

BGM
CODEC
DEMO
MOVIE
SLOT
VOX
STAGE

DEMO
I found all the cutscenes captions on this file.

BGM
I believe this file holds all the backgound musics of the game, I couldn’t find any kind of text in it.

CODEC:
In other versions of MGS, this file has all the codec conversations and it’s captions, but, I did’nt anything in the this version of Metal Gear Solid, so, I believe it’s some kind of  encrypted data or something (that's why I need your help   ).

MOVIE
Contains the captions of the briefing files and all the other movies played when a character is giving an explanation of something...

SLOT
The only two things I found on this file are the words: “checking memory card” and the Major Tom information (that shows on the radio along with his photo).

VOX
 All captions from the audio played during the game, like when a soldier spot you.

STAGE
Couldn’t find any kind of text in this file.


 That’s it, a lot of the translation is done, I’m actually at the end of the DEMO file wich contains all the cutscenes captions, I need a help in locating the text of the menus and  the text of the radio.

 I’ll be very grateful for anyone who can help me with this.   

 Everything I translated until now is really wortking on my PS2, I have an original copy of the game, and I’m translating everything and burning the game on a DVD-RW. 

Thanks for everyone, and sorry for my mistakes in english.

this section typically works by uploading an unknown format for others to examine at their own leisure. so not the right forum for such a question.

but while you're here, if you've spent time on the subtitle format, consider sharing it.

Thanks for the answer friend!   

Can you help me where I should post this topic? Or, there's a way to send it to other section of the forum? Thanks...

The subtitles are on the VOX.DAT file, and you can extract it with Konamy.Dat.Utility.exe.

Even if in Russia there is still no translation... 

I think you won't succeed too. Russia has very powerful fan translation scene, but still... 

But I know a fan group which translated MGS2 for PS2 into Russian.

I can give you an ICQ number of one of the members. They know MGS structure very good, maybe they will help you (they said MGS2 formats are very similar to MGS3 ones)
