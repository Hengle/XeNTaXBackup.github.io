I was playing MC3 when something happened while I was at the Garage. When I was checking out my cars the image uptop that shows you what car it is changed. And instead of the car company logo, a car with lines in the background and underneath the car it says Downloads. Can anyone pls explain what the heck it is?

I guess it's just a glitch.
