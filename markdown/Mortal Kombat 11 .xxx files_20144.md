- Post Title: Mortal Kombat 11 .xxx files

Been trying to figure out how to get the audio files out of a .xxx file in Mortal Kombat 11. Someone apparently managed to get the Main Menu theme extracted out of the .xxx file, but hasn't really showed or explained how he did this. [Here's a download link from the thread I found before with some of the .xxx files.](https://puu.sh/DlsGE/d8f944b97b.zip)

If anything else is needed, let me know.

Heheyy that's my zip   

I'm also quite interested in this. I'll try to PM Shokoniraya who found a way to extract the .wav, maybe he'll reply

Ok so I didn't get a reply yet but I kinda got it working my own way. First you have to decompress all the .xxx files that have sounds in them. I didn't know which ones were that so I decompressed all of them

Use QuickBMS and this script by Shokoniraya

Then I used Ravioli Game Tools Extractor to scan all the newly decompressed .xxx files. Changed the settings to this and it automatically converted all the .wems to .oggs or .wavs for me. 



The only downside is that I have no idea what I'm doing and as such there are no real file names for any of these files, sorry

Update: Ok so the .xxx files have everything except the actual character voice lines, banter, etc. Those are located inside the .psf files. They don't need decompressing, so just repeat that last step and extract-convert them with Ravioli.

This worked, holy fuck! Amazing job, dude. A bit of a bummer that the files don't have the proper names, but fortunately, most files that you extract are properly labled anyway, and I am sure we will get a proper extractor sometime.

I also saw that you did what I wanted to do; extracting the Johnny Cage Announcer. 

Although looking at it again, some files seem to still not work, the "Media" files especially, which for the announcer packs probably means stuff like "x Wins!", "FATALITY!" etc.

Thank you, all credit to Shokoniraya. They're the one who did all the actual work by figuring out how to decompress the .xxx files. I was just pressing buttons hoping that something would stick   I'm glad it worked though, have fun

You have to use the Ravioli Game Tools Extractor on that file then with the settings that were posted above.

the audio format in the switch version is RIFF style header, but in WEM format in case if anyone was wondering.

Hi guys,

I saw some people swapped the announcer. Do you know if there is a way to swap audio files in the game? or characters models?

Thanks
