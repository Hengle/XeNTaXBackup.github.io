- Post Title: Pokémon HOME 3D Models and Textures (Mobile Version)

Has anyone tried extracting the files in the mobile version of Pokemon Home? I wanted to see if it had 3D Models and Textures of the Pokemon since the mobile versions let you view the models of the Pokemon. I tried to extract them with Nox Player and Ninja Ripper but no dice.
