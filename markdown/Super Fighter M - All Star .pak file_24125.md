- Post Title: Super Fighter M - All Star .pak file

Hello.

I opened the .obb file of Super Fighter M - All Star and i found an heavy .pak file. By checking the inside with a text editor, we can see a lot of stuff. There is even file names with their file paths. I mainly want the audio files, since this bootleg game is known to have "unique" catchphrases.
I tried with the .apk version of the game, but i didn't found what i was looking for. Also the game is developped on Unity.

Here's the file : [https://www.mediafire.com/file/d34e48k8 ... d.zip/file](https://www.mediafire.com/file/d34e48k8snetfuv/2020-10-23_17-33-36_Android.zip/file)
Also let me warn you the file is almost half of a Gigabyte.
