- Post Title: Arma 2

With Operation Flashpoint and Arma it was easy. Just extract the campaign pbo and move it to a backup folder, then edit willy nilly. With Arma 2 they changed things significantly.  Now I have everything done, the subtitles/lipsync/ogg/everything.  But the old method refuses to work, probably because of the new bisign's that are included with everything. 

Any ideas?

Ok...I should know better than to post when I'm so tired.

I finally figured out the modfolder/pbo/whatever and I can get the subtitles in. My problem now though is the dubbing.pbo, my partial 6.47MB pbo.  If I start the game up with it in the mod folder the game complains about missing folders.  Is there an alternative to making a 1GB pbo that contains everything?

I think you are better off asking in the modding forums for ARMA 2: [http://www.bistudio.com/support](http://www.bistudio.com/support)
