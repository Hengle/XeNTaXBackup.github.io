- Post Title: Packing .vsf

Hey all, I'm new to this board!

I recently purchased Metro Redux (2033 & LL) and would really like to change some sounds around. I've already extracted the sound files, but I can not for the life of me find a program to pack the files back so the game can use them. I've searched all over and the only files I can find that might work all 404'd.

How can I go about repacking the sounds?
