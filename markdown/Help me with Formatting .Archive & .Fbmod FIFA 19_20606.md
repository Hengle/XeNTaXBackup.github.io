- Post Title: Help me with Formatting .Archive & .Fbmod FIFA 19

I do not know what to do to extract or open it . I met this format in fifa18, aluigi made script for extracting, but the fifa19 has different structure. I have attached file at the bottom.
Thank you!

FBMOD is a Frosty Tool Suite mod file.
You technically aren't meant to extract these but...
The format changed with the 1.0.5 release of Frosty.
