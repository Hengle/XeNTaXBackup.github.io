- Post Title: [PS2] Deus Ex: The Conspiracy *.lin files

Anyone know a way to extract these? 
They seem to contain maps and their respective models, textures, and sounds.
They're seemingly different from the ones in Unreal Tournament, or Magna Carta. 
They're stored in .umd files which can be opened with a UMOD extractor, all of them are in PSX2LINS.UMD.
