supports dxt1, dxt3, rgba8888, top level mip only

aluigi made a bms script to extract headerless image data years ago here:

but i thought it better to utilize the header info stored in the table to 
display the data properly and without having to extract everything too
if you just want to see whats in the tx archive.
