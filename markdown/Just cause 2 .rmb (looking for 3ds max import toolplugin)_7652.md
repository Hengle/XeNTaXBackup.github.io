- Post Title: Just cause 2 .rmb (looking for 3ds max import tool/plugin)

I know there is a script made by someone on xentax to import character models from jc2, however it's for Blender only and I don't want to start learning how to use an all-new complex and professional software.
However I will indeed consider switching to blender to learn a few basics about scripts and how to use them IF the import script can also import the vehicle models, not just character ones.
Any replies stating whether or not it is indeed possible for the plugin to also import vehicle models OR any help with getting just cause 2 models into 3dsmax would be much appreciated!

I tried it, but it doesn't work. My best guess is it doesn't work with dx 10/11 ONLY games such as just cause 2 (supposedly).
And yeah... 3d ripper dx only supports direct x 9 games doesn't it?

3D Ripper DX won't work on Vista and Windows probably won't work too.
