- Post Title: Tutorial request: Translation Tool

Hello guys.
I'm interested in translate the game into my language.
I know a little bit Visual Basic .NET, and some C#

Can someone make a tutorial for, how to make a translation tool to open text files?
Like Codemasters's .lng file. (example: [Click](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/20577703/language_eng.lng) )

Thank you.

I think you should ask MrAdults since he is one hell of a programmer

There is no "This is exactly how you do it" thing for this. You just create a program that can read, edit, and then write the files.

Bumping this.
I just got Dirt3, and it needs a new tool. Can someone make a tool for it, and also a tutorial?

Do you know how to program? If you don't, there's no point whatsoever asking how to write such a tool, since all it boils down to is programming (and, most of the time, not any particularly fancy programming either - you're just reading file contents and writing them somewhere else, and if your program is a GUI program instead of a CLI program, you also have to take care of window management). On the other hand, if you know how to program, you probably don't need to ask how to make such tools, since you should already have all the necessary knowledge once you know enough to write your own programs.
