- Post Title: Heat the Soul FPK

I've been looking into the FPK format for the Heat the Soul series and have been using an FPK extractor/rebuilder that was made for the Naruto FPK files, it seems to extract fine but when building the game fails to load the file.

I've made sure that the FPK files are the problem by ensuring the LBA for the file stays identical, and the file size is always smaller than the original, I literally just rebuilt the archive with the same files, so I'm thinking the rebuilt FPK files are the problem.

Is there any information on the archive anywhere?
