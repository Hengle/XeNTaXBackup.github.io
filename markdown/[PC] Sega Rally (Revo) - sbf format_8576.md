- Post Title: [PC] Sega Rally (Revo) - sbf format

Hi guys! I'm a bit of a newbie here, so don't be surprised when you notice a little naivety in some of my posts.

Anyway, I recently picked up Sega Rally again (a.k.a. Sega Rally Revo, in US), and as I'm a modeler, I was becoming interested in maybe modding some cars of Sega Rally (I know - ambitious  ). 
So I started looking at the formats that Sega uses for this game, and it is clearly one (archive) file format, as you'll find nearly nothing but SBF files in the folders. Localizations, cars, AI... However I don't know if this concerns a compression.
I already Googled it, but it doesn't seem to be known. And that's where XenTax comes in handy.  

Now I already looked around a bit with a Hex editor, and the files seem to have an SBZ1 header. Don't know if that's a known format?

I packed some sample files, so someone can check:

Thanks in advance
