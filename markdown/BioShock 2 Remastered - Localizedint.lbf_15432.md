Love how they still left the GFWL lines untouched even if the game no longer uses the service.

Is there a working unpack/repack tool or an LBF editor for Bioshock 2 (Remastered) to edit LocalizedXXX.lbf files?
I'd like to fix some Italian typos in the textâ€¦

LocalizedIta.lbf is mainly a big UTF-16LE file, but contains also some additional bytes to probably define every string length I still can't figure out after a long analysis with my hex-editor... Attached samples.

Here is a working tool made by banz99!
[https://1drv.ms/u/s!ApMUGr0cuN39gcYoFp0 ... w?e=SLigyw](https://1drv.ms/u/s!ApMUGr0cuN39gcYoFp0HvU8oL6P8Rw?e=SLigyw) ("Bioshock 2 (Remastered) string manager final.zip\Bioshock string manager\bin\Debug\Bioshock string manager.exe")

Tested and perfectly working with Steam PC version of Bioshock 2 Remastered.
Don't use it for Bioshock (Remastered) that uses a similar and simpler file format you can easily modify with any hex-editor.

Will generate a subdir with the name of the archive + EXT (e.g. "Localizedita.lbf EXT") containing all extracted files, and starting from the same dir location will repack a new "...\Localizedita.lbf EXT\REBUILT.dat" file inside. Rename and move REBUILT.dat to the original game Localizedita.lbf position in the end of course (replace original file).
Enjoy and good luck!
