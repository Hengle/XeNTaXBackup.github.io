How would I go about recompiling a .360.zip file? I managed to extract it but I need a method of recompiling it the same way it was before.

why you open a new thread about the same thing you started here?
[viewtopic.php?f=10&t=6318](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=6318)

if it's a normal zip why don't you use a normal zip archiver like 7-zip?

or is it a particular zip that you can extract ONLY with quickbms and zip.bms?
in this case you could use the reimporting feature of quickbms (version >= 0.4.10b)
