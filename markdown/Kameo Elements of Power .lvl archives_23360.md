- Post Title: Kameo: Elements of Power .lvl archives

.lvls contain the data for a scene/level in the game, including models, textures, shaders, etc.

A program exists with very rudimentary support for this; although you have to assemble models yourself by hand, manually, which can take over an hour to do.

Would like to find a better way to manage these files.

Attached is an example .7z containing said archives. Due to filesize, it is hosted on MEGA.
