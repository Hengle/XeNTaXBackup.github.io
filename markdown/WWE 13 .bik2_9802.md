In previous installments the videos were just .bik files that you could open in RAD Video Tools, and edit and view and do with as you please.  This year that doesn't seem to be the case.  Here is a few examples of the .bik2 files.

I took a quick look, and although the container format appears the same as the original BIK (except for the "magic bytes" and version number at offset [0-3]), manually changing those bytes to "acceptable" values still results in improper playback in Rad Video Tools.  

Seems this is a new version of the encoding process?

This has been puzzling my mind every since i got the game, hoping someone out there can find out how to convert them or create them...?

The PS3 version of the game has regular bik files instead of the bik2.  I may try to get my hands on it, and replace the bik2 files with the regular bik files and see if I have any success.
