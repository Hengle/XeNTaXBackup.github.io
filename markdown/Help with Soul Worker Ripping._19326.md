- Post Title: Help with Soul Worker Ripping.

Hello!

I've been trying to find a tutorial or instructions on the internet on how to correctly rip and convert models from Soul Worker.

but no matter what I search and find, it leads to Ninjaripper (Which I've attempted, and does not work due to the game being launched from a launcher.) and many people talking about unpacking and converting .V into other things, nothing that actually explains how to obtain anything from the game itself.

could someone PLEASE lead me to an actual tutorial, or provide an explanation or step by step instructions on how to rip and convert files from Soul Ripper?

please and thank you!

I'm trying to obtain my character.

Would like to necro this, despite if its against game rules, ban me if so. But this is a hot topic while might not seem like it, would appreciate any kind of help.
