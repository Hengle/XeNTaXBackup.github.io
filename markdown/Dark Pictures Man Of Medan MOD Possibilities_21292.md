a few days ago a MOD user discovered a way to extract models from Man Of Medan.


The assets can be found in the folder "SMG019\Content\Paks" 
using tools such as "umodel" to extract the ".uasset" files inside of the .pak.
the location for characters and textures is in - Game\Characters\Models


(Right click and select "Save folder packages".)
After extracted then use "Noesis" to view and extract their assets into 3D editing tools. (UE4 version 20.3 seems to work.)
The edited models can then be taken to UE4 for packaging and then use "unrealpak" to repackage it in .pak.  

The Demo Of Dark Pictures is available to download for free. so is anyone interested?

I managed to import a character to UE4. 
i can't seem though to figure out the materials they were using.

i wonder if there was a way to import the ".uasset" files directly into UE4.
and save all of the troubles of re-implementing all of the materials back.

Hi, sorry to bump this up. But I find this game really interesting these day. Could you show me how to extract the models, plz? When I use umodel to extract the folder of models, it always run to error.
