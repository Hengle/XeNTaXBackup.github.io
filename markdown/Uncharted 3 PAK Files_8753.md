I can't extract the PAK files from Uncharted 3. I've been searching everywhere and tried many programs, but nothing works. Can anyone help? Here are a couple of them: [http://min.us/mGFUaR3rw/1f](http://min.us/mGFUaR3rw/1f)

Uncharted 3 is on PS3, and is developed by Naughty Dog (owned by Sony). It was released in November 2011.

What did I do wrong? I just edited more info about the game in the original post, and there are no demos for this game. I do have a beta of it that was free and available to everyone at one point, but isn't available publically anymore.

Okay, good. If you could just provide a little more background then, as to why these files are not publically available etc. Mind that even when things are discontinued, the copyrights have not. Thanks!

The beta was only active for two weeks, in the summer of 2011.
