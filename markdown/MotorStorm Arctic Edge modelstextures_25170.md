- Post Title: MotorStorm: Arctic Edge models/textures

I've extracted files from Arctic Edge on both PSP and PS2 version by following a tutorial linked below, but I cannot figure out what to do with extracted files.
[viewtopic.php?t=19494](https://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?t=19494)

Folder named "StuffFiles" contains bunch of .stf files for characters and vehicles. Those probably contain both model and textures within them, although am unable to open them.
Here's a link for one such .stf file from PSP version of game, most probably a bike.

If anyone has any idea on what should I do with these, please do tell.

Afaik PSP Emulation has a very generic way of ripping its Models:

Never tried it though!

Problem is that PS2 and PSP versions of Arctic Edge have different models.. I already ripped a lot from PSP, but it lacks far too much in quality
