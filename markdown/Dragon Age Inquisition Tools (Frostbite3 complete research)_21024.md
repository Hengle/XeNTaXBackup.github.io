Dear community,

You probably know me michalss and my collage Kramla. As we are finished with translation this game a research, we would like to give a community gift. We actually used a lot of content from here in the past, so i believe we can pay it back by this release and help to all other good researches and ppl who helping out others. Archive below contains all our research and tools for localization purpose for DAI game. By work, i mean complete research above Frostbite engine that time version. However most of the things are still used in a new version of engines i believe.
If someone find it usefull and want to support us can donate something  [HERE](https://paypal.me/michalseckar)
