- Post Title: Bin file PasswordHash?

Hi!
I have a little problem, I can't find any software who can extract files from a PS2 game (Destruction Derby Arenas).
All game data is in a .BIN file.
But he is encrypted,Some people say that and because I can't open it with 7zip or other. (I get an error but no password input popup).
With an Unpacker tool, I get some SWF (flash) file, and with a software (JPEXS flash decompiler) I can see a cool thing:
passwordHash : String = 7qH�ش���@t]
But how I can extract files from a BIN FILE, with PasswordHash?
Thanks, And sorry for my english, i'm french ^^
If you need the file or screen, I can do that!
