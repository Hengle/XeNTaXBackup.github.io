In my former post [viewtopic.php?f=18&t=14000](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=18&t=14000) I was asking
for the graphics from CODBO2 because I was not able to rip that from my PS3 version.

Now I got the PC version too but I can't find the right tool. I need some help.
It seems the community is nearly dead but I still got hope.

why do you think that "the community is nearly dead" ?
