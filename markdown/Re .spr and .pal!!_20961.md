Hi,

Someone can help me in read *.spr files? I added *.pal files too, because I think this files use theses palettes.

Download: https://solitaire.onl/ 9apps.ind.in/ https://bluestacks.vip/

I already tried to use TextureFinder.

About HEADER of the *.spr files, I think it's something like:

Header
- sizeX
- sizeY
- totalLength

how close you are to .spr package?
