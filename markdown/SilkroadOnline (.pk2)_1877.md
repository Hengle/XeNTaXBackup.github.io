I scanned Music.pk2 (only 14MB ) with Jaeder Naub and ripped some files.

=D Hi there!

Im currently downloading the Client Game from the website too see if there are more goodies in the archives.

I guess the Ogg files work just perfectly?

however i think my ripper must have done something wrong
with detecting .sci , .it, .adx files in the archives, as these are most often not
used in PC games.

hope the soundtrack is enjoyable =))) ...still 60% left on download !

i suggest disabling "Various Gfx" as these are highly betarippers =D
