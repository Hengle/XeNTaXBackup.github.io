- Post Title: Predator: Hunting Grounds Model Extract

Hey all! I was hoping anyone has had any luck with extracting from this game? The trial dropped tonight and so far I've only been able to grab a few things using umodel w/ override control: Unreal Engine 4, 4.23. The only thing I'm having an issue trying to hunt down are the head models. I've found the dredds, Class Body Types, Masks, weapons and textures but no head models. 

I'd appreciate if someone could help me out. Thanks and have a good one!
