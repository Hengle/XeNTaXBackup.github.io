- Post Title: Mstar Unreal Engine 3 Excel Table File Modding/Editting

Looking forward to edit/mod this file but it seems encrypted. I used localization file encrypter/decrypted but seems it's not working. Is is possible to edit this file( decrypt and turn it into a editable *.csv - txt and then encrypt it back into *.tbl). Further information will be given throught this post or via message.

Here is an sample for this file: [https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/210 ... Notice.tbl](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/21041778/ServerNotice.tbl)

Thanks in advance for your precious helps.

P.S: Game is created with UE3 and I lack of this knowledge.
