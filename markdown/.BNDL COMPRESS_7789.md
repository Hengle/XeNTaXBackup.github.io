- Post Title: .BNDL COMPRESS

Hello there , 
is there any way to compress data to .bndl?
I heard that the bundle format was used by the mac os x, but i cant figure it out how i compress data with it.
Also i found an extractor which can extract .bndl files. (FEAR 2 TOOLS by crypton) 
So i was wondering if there is any way to create .bndl files... 
Thx for your answers.
