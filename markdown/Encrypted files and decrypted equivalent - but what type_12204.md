- Post Title: Encrypted files and decrypted equivalent - but what type?

Hey,

so I have a few encrypted files and their decrypted equivalent but I've been wondering how to actually encrypt the plain text and how to decrypt the encrypted one from the get-go.
Here are a few example files, _d files are decrypted. [http://www51.zippyshare.com/v/80455304/file.html](http://www51.zippyshare.com/v/80455304/file.html)

It appears that some kind of 8byte encryption is used to me which is the same for all files (see how the 00 Dwords are always BA 44 10 77 CA 11 11 A6). 

I would greatly appreciate any assistance! Game is MH3U for 3DS.

Best regards.

it could be any symmetric cipher in ECB mode which supports  64bit block length i.e blowfish , unless you've got more info about the algo and password there is nothing more to be done with just those 2 files

I could not make it work with the info you gave, it's too much of a guessing game, There is no help unless the information are 100% correct......
