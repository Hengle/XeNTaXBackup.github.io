I would also be interested in looking at the contents of those sdpk2 files from Brink. *subscribing this topic*

To collect whatever information we have on this topic here are some links I found:
* [http://svn.gib.me/public/brink/trunk](http://svn.gib.me/public/brink/trunk)  source code for some tool that works with sdpk2 
* based on the first link another tool has been written (info [http://komiga.com/2011/05/14/brink-sdmd ... -bigfiles/](http://komiga.com/2011/05/14/brink-sdmd2-and-sdpk2-bigfiles/)) with source here: [http://github.com/komiga/brinktools/tree/master](http://github.com/komiga/brinktools/tree/master)
* Snippets of discussion with Brink developer about that format: [http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/viewto ... 87&t=24453](http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/viewtopic.php?f=87&t=24453)

Files are here

```

```


but require compiling with VC Studio 2010

If you get it compiled, can you post the .exe here for everyone else?

I was able to use Visual Studio to compile the tools into an exe that successfully unpacked the sdpk2 file. I would be very happy to share sample files with someone who is able to figure out the format. I know next to nothing about reading files in a hex editor, but based on my glance at the files, they appear fairly straight forward.

I will post similar offers in the other threads on Brink. I hate to bump threads, but it's better than creating a new thread I suppose. Also I hope the right person will read this offer so we can finally access the Brink models.

Please PM if you're interested in working on this.
