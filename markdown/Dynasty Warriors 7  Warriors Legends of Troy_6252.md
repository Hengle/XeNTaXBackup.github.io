Ok so here it is.


First use offzip on the main archive
c:\offzip.exe -1 -a c:\file.bin c:\extract 0x0
it will make one big archive
then it will error out after a while that is fine all the characters have been extracted in this part.
next run the g1mt and g1mg bms files on this archive to extract the textures and meshes
then run the dds converter on the g1t files and my max script on the g1m files.

Mario and me worked on the texture bms and i made the max script.

This game is only out for ps3 so its ps3. The model format should be the same across all platforms.
The only difference will most likely be how they stored the models in the archive but tis method i posted works for troy and dw7

This is bit confusing.
Where is the model file "Warriors Legends of Troy".
The "DW7 Files.rar" contains one max script and three bms file, so anybody please explain how to use these files to extract model files.

If somebody already extracted the models files from the game archive then please upload somewhere, so we can download.

This would be really great.

Chrrox, do you know if Dynasty Warriors Strikeforce and Dynasty Warriors 5 models are viewable as well? 
I extracted the files from linkdata.bin with quickbms. 
Tried opening those with Noesis, but no luck.


Dynasty Warriors Strikeforce

make sure you have the new quickbms and make sure your file is decompressed.
it will take a while to get them all extracted.

Thanks "chrrox"

I finally extracted the "g1t" and "g1m" files with your procedure.

But one thing that, there are "9717" g1t files extracted, which all should converted to dds with your "dds.bms" script with the help of "quickbms.exe".

So if I try to extract the dds files one by one then, it will take too much time, so is there any batch file or script, which can convert all g1t files to dds.

Any body can help on this.

1 - associate *.bms files with quickbms.exe (open with...)
2 - run dds_converter.bms
3 - choose all texture files
4 - choose output path
5 - press ok

I have extracted these 2 models, but some parts are missing as the above image.
So anybody found these parts?

I think these parts are dynamically assigned to cloth physics in the game, but the mesh should be somewhere in that package, because the texture of that part is in the same file.

So if anybody can find, it would be great.

Yes any meshes that use physics I can not import. you will notice little scrunched up balls in the center of the model those are those meshes. If anyone can tell me how to read the 0x70 size vertex points ill fix the code to load those parts.

Did anyone get this working with the Xbox 360 version of DW7?
Well, I encountered a problem while trying to extract linkdata.bin.

c:\offzip.exe -1 -a c:\linkdata.bin c:\extract

I used Offset file unzipper 0.3.5, but then it gave me this error saying that my file is not valid.

Error: recheck your options, linkdata.bin is not valid

EDIT: Forgive my ignorance, I tried it with 0x0 and it is fine now.

read the reedme that comes with quickbms or just read the text that is run when you just run quickbms from command line it will tell you how to handle multiple files.
Quickbms only accepts one file as input by default.

Hi, I've got all the g1t and g1m files now.

Now how do I convert the g1m to ms? I don't understand from the original post. Also, when I convert the g1t files into dds it says there are multiple files of the same name are being extracted and would I like to overite, rename or skip. Which do I chose?

Lastly is there any recommended programmes to run and view dds/ms files?

Someone please help me, I really tried to do a lot from the guide and got stuck many times (I'm a noob).

Almost posted question as to why I can't find all the models (g1m) files, I only have 37.
Just checked the internet (again) and realized I have DW7, extreme legends, which has NEW characters but not the all the original ones.   , Textures also coming out kinda weird if anyone gets a chance to rip them and test there, may need an updated dds.bms file to deal with that issue.
Most of the models import fine, a few items, feathers and such, don't line up properly but most everything else does (great job on the import script) and the bms for that matter.


Off topic, finally got models ripped from Red Faction Guerrilla, which initially seemed unrippable so busy with that until I can find Legends of Troy

pack0 -g1m, g1t, and extracted dds files for testing

the g1m files do not import into 3dsmax, errors posted previously

g1t files and associated dds extracts in file for comparison and (i hope) update to BMS scripts

I think it uses both at least for pc version.

I've checked bin file with other chinese made tool (which can export pictures and mesh with obj format but not bones)

I finally found out the issue with the script in regards to the ARGB32 files. The colour channels are just wrong. You have to swap red and green, and blue and alpha. So you can write a simple script to unpack and re-pack each dword after the 0x80 header and they'll be fixed.

Also you need to set the bbp to 8 in the dds.bms for DXT5 textures to get them to extract correctly.

it will take a while to get them all extracted.

How do you decompress the file or make sure it is decompressed? I tried using UltimateZip (uzext.exe) on the file but the command prompt didn't say OK or make an extra file, so I assume it's already decompressed?

So I went ahead and followed the steps for offzip by typing this in: 
g:\offzip\offzip.exe -1 -A g:\offzip\LINKDATA.BIN g:\offzip 0x0

(I put my offzip file and the linkdata.bin file in the same directory, on my external hard drive not my harddrive)

It gave me that looooooooong list of zlib errors, and at the end it said 3 valid zip blocks found, but didn't actually make a new archive anywhere that I can tell. ????? 

I checked the properties and the bin file is not set to Read-Only or anything, so....?

Eh.  

[EDIT1] That's DW6 files btw. I also tried with Orochi 2 files and got 40 valid zip blocks found, but again, no actual extracted archives -- I even made a folder and tried again -- ie: g:\offzip\offzip.exe -1 -A g:\offzip\LINKDATA.BIN g:\offzip\extracts 0x0

So: confusion, aggravation, hopelessness, despair. Full stop.

I would really appreciate some help with this -- is there no one still active on this thread who has successfully extracted from the Bin files using the offzip method?

I tried again this morning, and this time I used  g:\offzip\offzip.exe -1 -A i:\LINKDATA.BIN g:\offzip 0x0 and it gave me an entire list of zlib Z_DATA_ERRORs

The data in the file is not in zip format or uses a different windowsBits value (-z). Try to use -z -15 

Then it says 3 valid zip blocks found.

[EDIT] I figured it probably wanted the Linkdata.bin file as a .zip file, so I put it in a zip and then tried again. Same deal, but now it says 1 valid zip block found.

What now? There is no "it will make one big archive then it will error out after a while that is fine all the characters have been extracted in this part" and I really do need help trying to figure this out; I would sincerely appreciate any pointers.

I don't have that linkage.bin but from what I know it's about 7 GB of size?

Did you ever successfully use offzip on smaller files?

If 'no'  there are dozens of examples in this forum: [viewtopic.php?f=16&t=12617&p=103783&hil ... +a#p103783](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=12617&p=103783&hilit=offzip+a#p103783)
for example.

Most of them have Z_DATA_ERRORs, too.

"3 valid zip blocks found" means that there should exist three extracted files (i.e. unzipped "zip blocks") in your destination folder (g:\offzip).
If there are no files check your access rights.

btw: zipping the linkage.bin file then using offzip on it doesn't really make sense

Yes, and longer!

I've never used Offzip period.   

Dynasty/Samurai/Orochi is the first, only, and at this rate last game series I've ever extracted from that didn't have a simple model viewer/extraction tool. So I am thoroughly confused by everything, really. But it'll be SO worth the effort if I can finally learn this whole process, since I love the games and the models are amazing. 

I've used Ninja Ripper and got models and textures that way...but I still want to figure out Chroxx's way, since it looks relatively simple; I just can't get offzip to give me the archive!

I think it's definitely something to do with the access permissions, but I can't tell if they're already decompressed or locked/blocked or what. I checked the file properties and nothing like Read/Write Only or anything is checked. And I have full administrator control. Offzip ran just fine, said it found valid zip blocks, but nothing's being extracted. I don't know.

I have converted the PS3 tools to PC and fixed some bugs.

the halffloat routine in max script is not checked whether it works or not. (PC seems not use it.)

mainly simple big endian and little endian conversion stuffs.

The problem is that it has large number of data and it's very hard to find which one is which one..

dds script has a bug, you must swap width and height
change
  Math texW p set1
  Math texH p set2
to
  Math texW p set2
  Math texH p set1

I think it uses both at least for pc version.

I've checked bin file with other chinese made tool (which can export pictures and mesh with obj format but not bones)

I know this thread is old, but does anyone with experience using Sgwstool mind explaining how to use it, please? It's all in Asian characters I don't understand.

The tools are simple
From Left to Right
Open - Open *.bin files from Dw7

-- With single top level selected
Import Data - Raw data block import
Export Data - Raw data block export, extension is *.data, it uncompress the block and export. so you can export *.g1m or *.gtm
-- With sub data selected
Import Resource - If it's picture, you can import picture
Export Resource - If it's picture, you can export picture to bmp or png format. if it's mesh you can export to obj (for mesh, icon can be gray, but you can still export with right mouse button menu in the right panel). but obj export seems not perfect

> Ok so here it is.


First use offzip on the main archive
c:\offzip.exe -1 -a c:\file.bin c:\extract 0x0
it will make one big archive
then it will error out after a while that is fine all the characters have been extracted in this part.
next run the g1mt and g1mg bms files on this archive to extract the textures and meshes
then run the dds converter on the g1t files and my max script on the g1m files.

Mario and me worked on the texture bms and i made the max script.

The link is dead,

Where can i get Offzip.exe and the G1mt G1mg files? >.<

Hey guys, how about using these tools to extract models from Nioh? I've heard it uses the same dinasty/samurai warriors engine.
