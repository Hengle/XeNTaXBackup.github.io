Help yourself and post the game name. 
Edit your thread name with it, maybe someone already worked on it, maybe someone worked on similar format, from the same company, etc.

If not, then at least you will get more people interested.

From the pic you can see that I missed faces (seems it's two of them).
You'll have to repair that for yourself.

What did you try, where did you get stuck?

where's this model from? Heroforge? (I wouldn't support getting models from a paid site, sorry.)

The vertex data is most likely stored in Short, but is divided not by 0xff, but by another number.

For reals, how do you do it? I've been trying to achieve your result for over 3 weeks now, reading through your hex2obj thread, trying to work out the patterns, find addresses and stuff to no avail. Guess I am totally uneducable.
Could you provide some clues of what to look for? Does it have the UVs, is it sequential or blocked?

Well, probably. But I didn't really get this line. And the example he provides gives a cube of messy verices.

The "messy cube" is what I got, too, with hex2obj, vertices unhandled, but to emphasize, I'm not here to compromise commercial sites like Heroforge which want to earn money with their intellectual property.
