- Post Title: Starship Troopers .SBM

There have been some old threads on this model format, but no one has worked on it. Chrrox said it looked simple, so could anyone make a maxscript for this? [viewtopic.php?f=16&t=3847](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=3847) That's a link to the old thread. It would be easier to use the model if it was in a t-pose.

2 samples containing animation files (.sba) with the .sbm: [http://www.gamefront.com/files/20345348/2samples.rar](http://www.gamefront.com/files/20345348/2samples.rar)

Thanks for looking into this.
