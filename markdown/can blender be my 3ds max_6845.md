- Post Title: can blender be my 3ds max?

Hi.
For nearly every 3d model format 3ds max seems to be the last port of call. You unpack the game's archive with this tool, then you 
convert models using that tool. Most of the times this conversion gives you a 3ds compatible file. Or instead of a converter somebody
wrote a script to directly import models into 3ds.
Now I'm not a stundent anymore and cannot legally get 3ds max for free. The obvious alternative seems to be blender. What are the 
limitations here? Can it deal with 3ds max files? Does it understand 3ds max scripts?

Thank you

It doesnt take in .max files, and it doesnt work with max scripts is my experience.

Blender uses python scripts. Can't import .max, though it can import some other file formats, plus, well, python's not that hard a language so if you can get a format descirption making your own importer's always an option (and in fact maybe someone's made a .max importer, but it's certainly not part of the default set).
