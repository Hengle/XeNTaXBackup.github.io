- Post Title: SaveData.dat

since the paint tool can be hacked what about downloading caw from people instead of going on Live and downloading it, ive tried every way of doing it but it didn't work, but i realised when you make, edit or delete a caw it says something about it being removed or saved into the savedat.dat fileis there anyway to open it, except hex editor because hex editor is very complicated

thank you
