I found some information!

when I unpack Danball Senki W Chou custom, finally I got format of these file through compare with Danball Senki Wars's hex!

l2 file's format is .moflex
MRON3.00 file's format is .rif
SeekFile Ver1.00 file's format is .seek

Still I don't find how to unpack it, but I think it quite meaningful finding!
