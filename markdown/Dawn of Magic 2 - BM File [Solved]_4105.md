the parts are too small, are needed at least the first 12 megabytes at the beginning of the archive to be 100% sure of its format.
for the moment I have been able to write the following script for quickbms but I can't know what compression algorithm has been used (or even encryption) and if exist folder names after the file_info table.
maybe try but is better to have the other needed megabytes:

*edit* work-in-progress...

uhmmm, I have scanned the various compressions and none of them seems the correct one used in this game.
I suspect of a possible obfuscation, anyway now I'm downloading the patch but I doubt to find something

update: no luck with the patch since it contains no executables/dlls
