- Post Title: Ace Attorney Trilogy PS4 "Guilty/Not Guilty animation"

Hello, XenTax!
Our translators team need some help with Ace Attorney Trilogy.
We have modified Assembly-CSharp.dll from PC version and unmodified Il2CppUserAssemblies.prx from PS4.
I don't know why, but CAPCOM put animation data for english version of "Guilty/Not Guilty" in this DLL, and we need "copy" animation data from PC-version to PS4.
All needed files in archive. Thanks in advance!

UPD: Animation store in "judgmentCTRL".
