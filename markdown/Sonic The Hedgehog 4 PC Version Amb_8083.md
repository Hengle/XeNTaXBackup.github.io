Thank you for the script, it was really useful. 
I have a question related to Sonic 4 PC, is there a tool that allows the sound effects SND_FX.CSB file to be unpacked and repacked, or, would it be possible for there to be a script for quickbms for this?

it's a CRI file but it doesn't have the CPK header
I have tried some quick modifications to my cpk tool but it looks like it needs more effort.
try to open a thread in the audio section, you will have for sure more luck there.
