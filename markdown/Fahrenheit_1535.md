I have a demo of this game and have already taken a look at the archives - I think I ended up getting some usable specs for the format and will hopefully be implementing it soon.

Hi mate,

I did write a (Game Extractor) plugin for this game, and included it in the latest update. Full Version users can grab it immediately, but the Basic Version users will have to wait for me to upload a new version to sourceforge for you to download (in maybe 2-3 weeks time?). I don't think that there was anything usable from this game though like the files were non-standard or something...?

I wrote the plugin using the archives in the demo - it was a *.dat file and it opened without a problem. There might be a difference between the demo and the full version archives - I will have to take a look at it. Sorry about that.

Oh, if there are any *.idm files - can you please send them to us please? Thanks.

Hmm, it appears that I am still having problems with these archives - I obviously havn't figured the format out properly yet  . I will try to figure it out - but it just isn't as easy as it appears. Why do all these Blizzard-based people make it so hard?

Its really annoying - some people say it works and others say it doesn't 

I have written a plugin for the PS2 version of this game, which I will include in the next update - maybe this will work a little better.

Anyone is there, who can help? I need text from the game to translate the subtitles and font file to edit the chars.

I used 'idmtool.exe' to extract main 'big' files and it's all *.dat & *.dbr files with max size of 1-8mb, when i opened those with hex editor couldn't determine which kina format are they; and so it's ver, vey difficult to find which ones have sub-text and which one dxt for font.

Game has been released in 2005 and for now I even couldn't find a way to translate it for my native language. Hope on you.

Honestly, this is not much to go on. These are different types of database files. It's not an easy format, so I can imagine no-one responded yet, as they noticed it might be too much work. Perhaps if someone has the game they can take a better look at it.
