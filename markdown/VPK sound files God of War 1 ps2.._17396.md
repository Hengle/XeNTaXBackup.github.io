- Post Title: VPK sound files God of War 1 ps2..

Hey guys! im new here, i started a new project editing God of war 1 ps2, everything was going so good so far, but ive stomped with this VPK (stereo) audio file.

im able to extract the wav file to edit with vgmstream or VGSC successfully....
but if i want to repack or re encode to vpk, what tool let me do this task?

Unfortunately no tool exists for making VPKs directly. I believe there are a few tools out on the web that can encode to PS ADPCM but you may have to recreate the VPK header by hand and try to match the spec so that it'll work in-game.

Yeah im afraid so, but since the file that i want to edit differs in some kb compare with original ive just cut some part of the final file with hexadecimal editor [HxD] and gave me no problem in game, this is totally wrong and is a bad practice,  but if someone want to try and has it a similar scenario, just cut it out 

Thank you for your response

how do you extrack the VKP files?

if you want to extract all files from dvd game, go here [https://zenhax.com/viewtopic.php?f=9&t=7186](https://zenhax.com/viewtopic.php?f=9&t=7186), ive asked and used known tools to decompress or extract the files with some mininum troubles on a few audio files, but all tools that showed there, works.

Greettings

And when you are successful, I donâ€™t suppose you plan on submitting them to the Sounds Resource, do you?
