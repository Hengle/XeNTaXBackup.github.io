- Post Title: how to extract and compress a file in .pbd format of the game naruto accel 3

I am looking for help, my goal is to change the audios that are inside the .pbd file of the naruto accel 3 game, I know that the files are there because I can view them with the tool called PSound but it only allows me to listen to them and extract them in another format like this That is not very helpful, anyone who can help me would greatly appreciate it.

I leave test a file to work: [https://www.mediafire.com/file/bzisuq4q ... e.pbd/file](https://www.mediafire.com/file/bzisuq4q2817eyd/PL57_e.pbd/file)

a and I know that someone has achieved it but I do not know what method I use, I tried to communicate with him but he did not want to answer me
