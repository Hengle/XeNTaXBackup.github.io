Is there a way to rip models from Dead Space? 3D Ripper DX won't work for me. I've looked all over the place and I can't find an answer.

Good post, and it would be good researching not only model extractings but also any other formats for the game. I'm up for this...

Do we have any progress? I looked through Dead Space's game files, and it doesn't look like anything in there is models. I haven't tried OGLE yet, but I don't think that will work. BTW I tried 3D Ripper DX with Dead Space on Vista. I've heard 3D Ripper is a lot more compatible with XP. I'll try ripping on XP, but I predict I'll get the same results as on Vista.

One of my first app I wrote was "Dead Space 360" ... well, maybe that can be useful here.
I dont know if this also works with the PC version ... just try.

@Nasman- I've heard that people using XP with 3D Ripper have MUCH better success rates than people with Vista (I use Vista   ). The only thing I've kind of successfully ripped from is Guild Wars- model is all weird and malformed...
