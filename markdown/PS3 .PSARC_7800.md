Hi! there.
PSARC files I need to extract, but I can't find anything on how to do this.
This file from PS3 Ｇｕｎｄａｍ Ｅｘｔｒｅｍ ＶＳ.
Could someone please help me with this?

I'm also having trouble myself using the standard psarc.exe and another one from here. I'm betting it might be a different type of psarc that needs a modified psarc extractor to make it work.

EXVS.psarc: Probably the Install Data. I played the game yesterday from the copy I got in the mail and it seemed to make me install this for the same amount of space on the HDD.
stream.psarc: Maybe BGM or Movie Data?

it looks like bad dumps. I know someone with a debug ps3 who sent me a file and had none of these issues.

There's no way to dump my actual disc except off a console that's already like that? My PS3 FW is too high at this point for any kind of USB programmer exploit. I have a Blu-Ray Drive, I'm assuming it doesn't work though the way the dumping ones on the PS3 do since they need decryption.

I guess I'll just have to wait or maybe get a PS3 that's low enough down the road.

No one can help with encrypted files you need to get a good dump of the game yourself.
