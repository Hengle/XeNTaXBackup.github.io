Standard Wav. Just need the correct codec to play. (2)

Eh, looked at it better. I think the header is just  messed up. Standard codec.

In the streams.txt (all sounds are listed in it) they don't have a .wav but a .vag or .vig extension wich are PS2 formats I believe...

There's also a streams.juk wich lists all sounds with the following data:

SampleRate = 
Size = 
Duration = 
Pitch = 
DataOffset = 

Example:

[Song 34]
Filename = Aud\UI\125_Start01.vig
SampleRate = 44100
Size = 250240
Duration = 4.925079
Pitch = 3763
DataOffset = 0

I've included both files in an attached RAR file, I hope they help out...
