I am curious about the same thing, but i think Payday 2 is not worth the work yet, because contents are still coming out by now.

But: What about Payday: The Heist? As i know, it is using the same .bundle packages. I am wonder if there is any way to translate that game!

Is there anybody who can work with .lua scripts? People say there is a method to do this, and i need help with it. looks like Chinese translators already did it.
