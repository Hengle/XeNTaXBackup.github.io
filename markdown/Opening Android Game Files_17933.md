Hi there. I need someone to help me open these [files](http://www.mediafire.com/file/nnv8hfg77urhlff/Toukiden%20Mononofu.zip) I extracted from a mobile game called Toukiden Mononofu. I'm not very familiar with the format, so could anyone help me out here, please?

Files seem to be compressed. Are these the original archives?

By creating a back-up file (AB format) with Helium and converting it into a TAR file using Android Backup Extractor, I was able to extract the contents thanks to Aluigi's TAR BMS script. If you're willing to analyze the whole file for me, then I truly appreciate it. The file's AB and TAR versions can be downloaded here.

So these are not the original game archives. And you got only tens of megabytes out of 800 MB of data pack?

What I provided in the first post of this topic was a fraction of what I unpacked thanks to Aluigi's script. TarTool.exe can't seem to unpack it due to some error involving one of the files. I could share with you the whole archive that got unpacked, though that may take a lot more time to download. Would that be fine with you?

There's one thing that always need to be clear: what kind of assets do you expect from the game?

Tried to unpack the tar archive with aluigi's script but the naming issues just keep pestering me so I have to terminate the process.

All I want is to rip the 2D graphics and 3D models from this game for personal use. I bypassed the naming issue by changing their default names. The files I unpacked are right here: [link](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1GtWTe1rvKDEODFNh18MfFqPjZz3N85k7)

Same as those you'd uploaded before. You can't tell what these files are, and the data could be compressed or encrypted or whatever, at least I didn't see any helpful info there.
