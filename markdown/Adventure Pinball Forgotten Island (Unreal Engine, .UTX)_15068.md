- Post Title: Adventure Pinball Forgotten Island (Unreal Engine, *.UTX)

Hello!

I would like to ask you for some help. I need to edit font files for this game. It's based on Unreal Engine 1. There are 2 *.UTX texture files containing fonts. 

First one - PbFonts is used in main menu. I've edited this one and everything is ok. I've used an editor supplied with game (UnrealEd). 

But I have some serious problems with editing the second one - PinballFonts. This one is used during actual gameplay. When I'm trying to delete or replace texture in UTX file UnrealEd is just crashing. This is happening with original UnrealEd supplied with game. When I'm using standalone UnrealEd or UnrealEd from another game this gives me an information that texture can't be deleted because it's already in use.

I need your help! If someone had similiar problem any kind of help will be appreciated. If it is possible please take a look on file too!

Thanks!
