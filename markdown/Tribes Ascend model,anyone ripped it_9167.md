The models use the basic Unreal model format, just unpack the UPK files with UModel. The textures are another thing, and either needs decrypting, or dumped from the memory of the game while it's running.

Look at the facepunch.com release section. Someone pretty much converted all the models including the textures to the source format.

Keep in mind most of the textures were edited to work better in source though. Otherwise nabbing the textures from the game itself is incredibly annoyeing.
