Hello all.

 Sorry if this is in the wrong category but I've been trying my hardest to just rip the models (cars not people just so we are clear) for mesh research but to no avail. GPA won't inject into it and while yes ninja ripper 1.7.1. will inject it only picks up the people but no scenerey and no cars at all even when I look through the scope to make only the cars and people visible in the frame. The game comes packed with two .wad files which I will provide bellow. I have tried to look into the engine for this game but to no avail so I don't know where to start with these wad files. All I care about is the cars for research presidental motocade cars of this quality mostly aren't around in any other form then photographs and those aren't what I want.

 Any help will be greatly appreciate. Thank you for your time.

I know it's an old post, but I've started trying to accomplish the same thing, and here's what I've found so far.

Despite several claims online that it was built on the Soldier of Fortune engine, it actually uses a modified version of the Carmaggedon engine.

There's quite a lot of tools available for Carmageddon. (Here's a massive collection of them. [https://rr2000.cwaboard.co.uk/pc-files](https://rr2000.cwaboard.co.uk/pc-files)) but I haven't found one that will open these particular WADs yet. Once they're open it should be a simple task to get the models, as they're in .mdl form, which Noesis can handle. (Noesis supports Stainless WAD, but sadly this seems to be a slightly different version that it won't unpack)

I too have come upon this recently, I'm not sure how far you guys have come, I have had limited success ripping models with ninjaripper. Love to get all the models.

> I'm not sure how far you guys have come,I'd be surprised if anyone worked on it again/any further. Research is driven by the interest/input of the users which isn't overwhelming.  Anyways, I had another quick look and this model is too low poly for me:

I know topic is old but I wanted to mess with this game a little 
Everything is epic but I would like to change to what model Im shooting
I dont wanna touch anything politics 
Overall I remember that topic for many years ago and somehow that game Mille Miglia for PS1 reminds me about it

I have shared quickbms script and a WAD file format description in this topic [viewtopic.php?p=180646#p180646](https://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?p=180646#p180646)
You can check it out if you're interested in unpacking files from WAD archive.
