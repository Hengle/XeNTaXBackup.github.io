I have just released a tool that in my opinion can be useful in reversing game file formats.
For example it can be handy when there is a field containing unknown data (encrypted, compressed) or just a 32bit that we don't know what represent (zsize, size, crc?).

The tool is called Offbreak and you can find various examples on its homepage:
[http://revuln.com/tools/offbreak.htm](http://revuln.com/tools/offbreak.htm)

It has various options that allow to do our work in most of the situations, even when are used some anti-debugging protections or the target program is a bit problematic because you can place automatic hardware/software breakpoints, MessageBoxes that give you the time to attach the debugger when you desire, attach to pid or process name and so on.

Let me know any feedback, bug report or suggestion.

I'm working on a new version of offbreak just in these days.
It will be open source, more verbose and uses a better method to pass the parameters to the injected dll.

In the next days I will make some tests with specific games.

Currently there are no plans for a 64bit version, sorry.

When everything will be ready I will open a thread on Zenhax where you can share your suggestions and experience.
