- Post Title: What game can you extract models with animations from?

first of all, Happy new year! 

I think I should have said this in the title instead, what are games from which you can extract 3d models and convert them to .fbx, .dae or what ever WITH animations using some tools, for e.g. you extract 3d character model from the game archive, convert to .fbx and it has animations like walking, idle etc. and you can view edit it with editors like 3dsmax, maya, cinema4d etc. etc.

Doesn't matter what game, for as long as it's PC and you can do what i said above (ofc. not some games from the 90's lol) 

Thanks.
