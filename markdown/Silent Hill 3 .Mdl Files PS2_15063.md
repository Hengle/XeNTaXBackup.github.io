there seems to be some structures but who would waste his time with such if not the requester himself?

btw: if it's just for the models/levels I'd suggest to install the Silent Hill 3 trial on PC:

Thanks

The .Mdl of PS2 Version are very very different from .mdl of PC Version

 It is possible to find textures and edit?

(The .MDL PC Version I know edit, but .MDL are different.)

I'm working on a modification of the SH3 PS2 and I'm trying to edit the textures of .mdl Models
