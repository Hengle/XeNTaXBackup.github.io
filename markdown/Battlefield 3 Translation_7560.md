Hi from Turkey,


  We want to translate this game to Turkish language. But we have some issues with the files. Can someone help us to open language files?

I don't know which file has the subtitles but maybe 

en.sb (\Data\Win32\Loc)
bom.fb2 (\Data)

Probably en.sb has english audio files. Can someone help ?

And here is the \Update\Patch\Data\Win32\Loc\En.sb file.
