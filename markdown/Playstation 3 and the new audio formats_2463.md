- Post Title: Playstation 3 and the new audio formats

hi there 


now i'm struggling around with the audio file formats on PS3 (trying to rip the music from Resistance: Fall Of Man) and having troubles determining the codecs for the audio on ps3.

anyone who has knowledge about what sony has chosen as the generic codec for games on ps3? 


thanks in advance

I have no idea, but I have seen this before:

[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Audio_Coding](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Audio_Coding)

"AAC is also used as the standard audio file for Sony's Playstation 3 and as the default audio codec for the .m4v format that Apple employs in its iTunes Store video files."

Hope it helps

It's possible attach an example?
And if its AAC (or mpeg4 audio, it the same) you can reconvert with nero, ffmpeg, mencoder, faad/faac etc etc

all the audio files are located in a massive 6 gb file.

i'll try to cut out a 50 mb block of data or so...

Fall of Man uses the audio technology of VoiceAge 
This company uses ACelp audio codec too
Anyway try this:

VoiceAge Open G.729
[http://www.moviecodec.com/downloads/26d.html](http://www.moviecodec.com/downloads/26d.html)
and you can try the "universal" ffmpeg 

And of course try to attach a sample or file cuted like 10mb's  

More hints:

try to search "Fall of man audio" and/or "Fall of man Voiceage"
