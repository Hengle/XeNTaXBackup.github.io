- Post Title: Summoner 2 (PS2) .vmu audio file

I've been trying to figure this one out but I'm brand new to audio.

I tried AlphaTwentyThree's instructions from [https://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=17&t=9073](https://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=17&t=9073) but I couldn't get it to sound right.
Maybe I was doing it wrong so I would appreciate if someone else could confirm.

But at the moment I'm just trying to figure out the interleave using his script and randomly trying interleave values.
The frequency is most likely 22050.

The game is also available on the PC, so maybe you can have better luck trying to rip them. Also, do you have any plans to put the files up on [www.sounds-resource.com](http://www.sounds-resource.com) ?

Summoner 2 isn't available on PC, sadly. I would have no objection to putting the files on [www.sounds-resource.com](http://www.sounds-resource.com), but I was really doing it for "fun".
