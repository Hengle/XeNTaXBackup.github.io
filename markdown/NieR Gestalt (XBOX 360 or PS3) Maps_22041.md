- Post Title: NieR: Gestalt (XBOX 360 or PS3) Maps

Hi!

I, along with several other people, are looking for tools that would be able to properly rip maps from the original NieR. I have a friend who successfully ripped maps with the tools from the thread for the Xbox 360 version, but the problem they have is that it doesn't rip the UVs. If anyone would be willing to help, we have a discord mainly for Nier and Nier Automata ripping. If you want to join, here's the link: [https://discord.gg/AD4R2EQ](https://discord.gg/AD4R2EQ)
