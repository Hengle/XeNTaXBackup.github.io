- Post Title: Sansar VR - archive type .bag

Hello, if there's anyone free and wants to take a look on this file format, is from an online game called " Sansar VR ". It's a metaverse platform, and all player resources are saved in that cache type of .bag format. Bellow i attached a small file with user preferences, which are still saved in a .bag type format, the other files are to big ex: "ClientAssetCacheLarge.bag", as it saves the worlds and everything that player does in game, it downloads in that .bag
