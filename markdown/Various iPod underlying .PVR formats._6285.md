- Post Title: Various iPod underlying .PVR formats.

As with the .GTL (which never got solved) I have inspected many games and found them to have underlying PVR formats. Now, can someone find a way of extracting these properly. I have tried filestripper and Jaeder Naub but both have failed. WE need one specifically designed to search for and extract PVR files properly.

Take a look at this and see what you find, if anything. All I know is it has an underlying PVR format just as the "Boss" game did.

Yes but with this game all it shows is the Corefan Logo animations and nothing else.

.pvr and .pvrtc files are compressed formats supported by the PowerVR GPUs (get it - .pvr = Power VR, pvrtc = Power VR Texture Compression). If you download the PowerVR SDK, there are tools for converting from standard file formats. Apple also has a more limited version of the tool that gets installed with the iOS SDK.

The format is well documented on PowerVR's web site, including a white paper that defines the compression used.

As most of you know, I'm no programmer, thus I know little use for any of these fact sheets. But if someone could kindly get the graphics out of the 'Boss' files, I would be happy, and if you could get them out of the 'DevilHunterX' files, I would be even happier, as for Pocket God, well that's just a bonus for a friend of mine.
