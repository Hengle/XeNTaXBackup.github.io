I tried using the Electronic Arts Graphic Tools program to export the SSH files in NHL 2002, but I get errors every time I try to export. I also want to know if there's a program I can use to edit them, since NHLInfo, which edits their PC counterparts (as well as some PS1 counterparts), won't edit SSH files. Can anyone help me with this?

Upload a sample file. No one here can help without a file to see.

Sorry for the wait. I would upload a sample file that I wanted to deal with, but instead, I get this error. I'll mention the sample file instead:

Unfortunately, there is no way I can upload the actual sample file I wanted to upload in any way, shape or form other than a link, so here is another one that I find of use in a way.

Yep, it's linking time. Here are the links to the files.

Literally all you had to do to attach the file here was to zip it first. The list of allowed file extensions is included in the upload file dialog box (though admittedly hard to see the whole list). Checking that list, you'll note that such formats as .zip, .rar, and .7z are allowed.

I have checked your samples and then I have compared them with samples
from other games and below article is the result of my work:
[http://wiki.xentax.com/index.php/EA_SSH_FSH_Image](http://wiki.xentax.com/index.php/EA_SSH_FSH_Image)

I did also a lot of testing with many tools that are available on the web,
but unfortunately nothing works with your samples.

There is alternative way which involves some manual work.
Here is the instruction:
1. Unpack SSH files from BIG/VIV archives with BigGUI tool
2. (optionally) change magic value from SHPS to SHPI and convert to BIN file using FSH Line tool.
3. Open SSH\BIN file with raw texture cooker (for width and height parameters you can see file format on the wiki) [https://i.imgur.com/SGuyzxK.png](https://i.imgur.com/SGuyzxK.png)
4. Find a palette in game
5. Convert data and palette to BMP

Alright. Also, using your guide, I found a program called "ExplodePSH", with the creator claiming he was gonna make ImplodePSH, which would have reassembled the PSH file. Knowing my luck, it likely never existed because of how helpful it'd be to me.

In the future, please state such things up-front, so as not to mislead others who might be thinking about uploading their own samples. It's one thing if someone reads that there's a maximum size limit for zip files; it's completely different if they instead read a comment which makes no mention of zips but, due to how it's worded, implies they're not an option.

I was able to make some progress on researching these images and I have written a Python tool to automate extraction process from NHL 2002. 
Few other types from other games are also partially supported.

Here is my tool <link removed because it's outdated, see info below>

And some showcase below:

It's simple. Here's the instruction:

Thank you! One more thing...

The cyberface files are in the .cmb format.

Here's a link to an example cyberface. The mod I'm working on also needs modified cyberfaces, so if you could help me with that as well, that'd be great.

Also, there just HAD to be an error somewhere, which is what you'd expect from me.

SyntaxError: (unicode error) 'unicodeescape' codec can't decode bytes in position 2-3: truncated \UXXXXXXXX escape

What did I do wrong? All I did was edit the path like you said.

Looks like wrong path to me. You should use "\\" instead of single "\".

Here's the directory in which I want to extract the file.

Why don't you just use cmd [https://i.imgur.com/ZGUaVZy.png](https://i.imgur.com/ZGUaVZy.png)

or Python IDLE [https://i.imgur.com/DIwJ7gT.png](https://i.imgur.com/DIwJ7gT.png)


Also, there is a free version of Wing IDE, just look it up...

"Why don't you just use cmd?"

Because cmd does the same thing, as do IDLE and WING

Here's cmd's error:  File "C:\Users\User\Desktop\NHL_2002_PS2_Tool.py", line 7
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax

Here's IDLE's error:

Invalid syntax

And here's WING'S error:

File "c:/Users/User/Desktop/NHL_2002_PS2_Tool.py", line 1, in <module>
    <html lang="en" data-color-mode="auto" data-light-theme="light" data-dark-theme="dark">
Syntax Error: invalid syntax: <string>, line 1, pos 1

I would like to acquire your power... the power to have the script actually work.

Wait a second... why do you have "<!DOCTYPE html>" in there? xD
Are you saving this script with "Save page as" option or something?

If you really need to do it like this, you should go to "raw" version first
<Link removed, because it's outdated. See info below>
You can't have any HTML in the Python script...

Otherwise, just copy script's content to notepad and save it as new ".py" file.

Finally got it to work, but with some irony.

The script says "can't flip image", but the image ended up being flipped in the output.
