- Post Title: ps2 .ss2 audio

I have analysed 3 different ps2 game discs with cube media player in pursuit of the music from these games. CMP returned me several .ss2 (sony audio format i believe) files from each disc. I have searched high and low to find an app to decode/convert/decompress or even PLAY these stand-alone files, but to no avail whatsoever. Not even a bit of useful info. I am beginning to regret having actually legitimately purchased a cube media player serial.

Aside from the above mentioned, I was wishing to enquire whether anybody has any info, or knows of any programs that can convert any of these .ss2 files to a more legible format; or perhaps be able to play them, failing to accomplish the former.

Thnks guys

if can be useful there is a Winamp plugin called vgmstream which other than being actively developed supports also various types of console audio files included SS2 and imho using the own usual player (winamp, xmplay or anything supporting this type of input plugins) is more confortable than using mfaudio, hope it helps:

Pengulord take a look here: [http://hcs64.com/files/vgmstream/?C=M;O=D](http://hcs64.com/files/vgmstream/?C=M;O=D)
just copy in_vgmstream.dll in the plugins folder of winamp (or any other player supporting this type of plugins like xmplay and so on)

If you get the vgmstream plugin (works with winamp 2.76-- can get at oldversion.com)
 (vgmstream-r973-test.zip (extract C:\Program Files\Winamp\Plugins) and vgmstream_external_dlls.zip (extract dlls to C:\Windows\system32) ) to work..

(BETTER YET ! 

[http://out-lame.sourceforge.net/](http://out-lame.sourceforge.net/)
I found a plugin (out-lame -- be sure to configure output directory and lame_enc dll in the settings) for Winamp 2.x? that will allow for you to convert the files to mp3 files, automatically naming them thus:
from 01-boss-luminar.ss2 to 01-boss-luminar.ss2.mp3, etc. If you get an batch file renamer, you can remove the .ss2, etc from all the files.

Cheers as some do say! Have a wonderful day!
