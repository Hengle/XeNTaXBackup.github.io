- Post Title: [PSP] Danganronpa JPN .DAT Extract Help?

Well, first I'm sorry for my bad English... I'm really not good at it...
Second, could someone with experient please take a look at the bigfile (the Game Archive) for the PSP Game Name Danganronpa Kibou no Gakuen ro Zetsubou no Koukousei .aka Dangan Ronpa: Academy of Hope and High School Students of Despair. It a really good game and since it never release outside JPN I want to Translate the Game base on somebody script (so plz don't ask me if I know JPN - in fact... I know a little bit)

After messing around with ISO I'm realize that every resource of the Game is store in 2 bigfile: umdimage.dat and umdimage2.dat, so I try several Unpacker/Extracter to see what these 2 file contain... but no luck afterall. Then I'm use MadEdit (a Free Hex Editor) to see if text are store in them... but they are very large File and too big for Finding Text so I'm come up with nothing.

Next, I try Sky`s Console File Scanner, Cozy guy share this in alucard Forum (dunno if he share it here)..., I easily got the .GIM (PSP Image File) and the .GMO (PSP Model) out for checking... that not helpping with the bigfile Extract but since I can get the GIM and GMO I guess the bigfile this not Compressed and Encrypted in anyway (corrected me if im wrong - still new to this stuff!). And I also try QuickBMS Compression Scan but somehow it can't work...

The last thing I do is decrypt the EBOOT.BIN in the ISO, strangely the decrypted File contain some Text (as far as I know, every PSP Game has there Load/Save/Exit Text store in this file) that has all directory in the bigfile (I guess)...

So what I want you to help is some BMS script that can work with the bigfile and can reinsert the extracted file... (Or some way to Extract/Unpack them). The game is Develop by Spike, and since there is not much PSP Game dev by Spike that has been analyze... (they do a lot PSP/PS2 Game publish...) I'm cant do anything.

I'm already Upload the Cutter version of the bigfile (and EBOOT.BIN later - have to redecrypt the File), hope you guy can help me, and I can learn more from you... big thank to all XeNTaX's guy...

Here the File:
