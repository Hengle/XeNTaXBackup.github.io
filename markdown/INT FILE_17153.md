try swuforce scripts (i'm not sure if it supports this game)
 attached or from here (All his scripts) : [https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/ ... lpJT2c3Uk0](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B7LaUGSR3677MFlBRlpJT2c3Uk0)
(u need to install AutoIt v3 to run it [https://www.autoitscript.com/site/autoit/downloads/](https://www.autoitscript.com/site/autoit/downloads/))

it worked with some of Unreal Engine 3 games, 
run unreal_loc_int_export (select a folder and it will convert all *.SoundNodeWave to *.txt),
import later with unreal_loc_int_import_INT_unicode.

Good news  :
Export script is done.
import script is done.

(this is only for Afterfall Insanity, will likely not work with other games).
attached below.

About the error message:
you can ignore the error message because the import process is done   and this message tells you that It is finished.   
(anyway re-download the file above "Afterfall Insanity SoundNodeWave Export Import.zip" I updated it.)

About the "BBBBBBBBBBB" problem in Arabic:
BEFORE you translate a *.INT file open it with Notepad++ and go to "Encoding" -> and check "Encode in UCS-2 LE BOM", then translate the file and test it.
(if it did not work try with "Encode in UTF-8".  change the encoding before the translation not after.)
