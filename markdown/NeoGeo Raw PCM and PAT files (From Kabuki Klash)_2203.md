- Post Title: NeoGeo Raw PCM and PAT files (From Kabuki Klash)

Another thing I've been playing with this week XD

I have determined the PCMs to (obviously) be raw PCMs that contain several sounds, the PATs though I speculate to be what tells the sample rate and etc. I've tested PCMs in Game Audio Player with various settings and came down to 8-bit and a sample rate between 10000 and 8000 and "Sign bit" gave the clearest audio and it is pretty recognisable but far from perfect, still gotta tweak it some.

But if the PAT contains this data it would help fill in the gaps of understanding in this field.

Stereo? Hm... I thought it was mono . I'm still thinking the PAT might be the thing that tells how they are played. Hm.
