- Post Title: Texture Help

Hi, i'm new here so i'm sorry if this is the wrong section...please move it if it is

I was wondering if anyone had textures of the old Backyard Wrestling games...there are textures from a few people in the game I want but I don't a) have either of the games and b) have no clue how to extract textures
