Well I posted full source code for Noesis's NMD loader module, so anyone could support them without having to figure the format out themselves. To my knowledge, though, nothing else does load them. Feel free to send over NMD's which cause crashes and I can correct the crash in future versions. Though it is possible that the NMD's causing the crash do not actually contain any useful data anyway.

I only replied out of interest toward fixing bugs in Noesis, as I'm perfectly happy fixing bugs. I will not, however, send you content. While digital copyright law in your country may not object, I personally walk a fine line there. I legally own all of the content that I "explore", and sending other people content is absolutely out of the question. To do so would have fairly grievous implications upon what I do in contrast to the terms of the DMCA.

Not to mention, don't you think it's rather selfish of you to just ask for converted files while showing no interest in improving the tool?

Wait, you're saying that its illegal to share a converted file?!? OMG! I think I just share a little converted file of tekken to someone! Am I going to jail? omg! I never thought of that! I'm so sorry i'll never do it again!
