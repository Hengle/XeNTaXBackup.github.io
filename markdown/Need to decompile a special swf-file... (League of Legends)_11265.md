- Post Title: Need to decompile a special swf-file... (League of Legends)

Hey Guys,

at the moment, I try to modify the game "League of Legends" a little bit.
I'm already able to play on old maps (like Old Twisted Treeline and Summoners Rift (Winter)), old/time limited Modes (showdown, one for all) in Custom/Co-op vs AI - Games.

I want to decompile a special swf-file because I want to ADD some scripts (and images) to it.
I already tried to decompile it with "SoThink SWF Decompiler" and "FFDec" into fla (because i can't decompile it to flex).
But I have problems with recompile it with Adobe Flash CS6.

[mod_man.swf](http://ul.to/x4pjhfpg) => Need help with this file
[ImagePack_misc.swf](http://ul.to/zz99ku36)=> I was able to decompile it to flex AND recompile it back. (For example)
[both files in one .rar for download](http://ul.to/9ok1rz68)

Anyone can help me with this?
I want to know how to decompile AND fully recompile the mod_man.swf WITHOUT Errors, because I want to ADD some Files(Images) and Scripts to it.
asasm wouldn't work, because I can`t add images with asasm to this swf

Thank you :3

I have to add one or two actionscripts to it to embed removed maps back into the game^^
I have to decompile + recompile it. It wouldn`t work with .fla - decompiling, so I need a way to decompile it as .flex (if possible) or any other way

this tool is only way to do this
if you can't do decompile with "SoThink", so you can't do anything with this file, i think

Heya,

I tried to decompile it with Sothink Decompiler
[](http://abload.de/image.php?img=exportonlynvjeg.png)
Only FLA was possible, not flex :/ (I like flex more)

Then, I tried to load the fla with Flash CS6, I get this error (unexpected file format)
[](http://abload.de/image.php?img=unecpectedfileformat80k93.png)

I tried to decompile it with FFDec to fla. It can be loaded with CS6
[](http://abload.de/image.php?img=ffdecexport54k2y.png)

but I can't recompile it because I get errors
[](http://abload.de/image.php?img=errorr2uak5v.png)

Any Ideas?

I think I fixed some of the errors...
But now, I could need your help with this two errors (1120, 5000).
If I could fix this two errors, I can recompile it without problems^^

EDIT:

I tried it, but I don't know how I can add files (.as Scripts) with it :/
I also don't know how I could try to decompile the swf with the Sothink SWF Editor .

Sothink SWF Decompiler  can extract script but all scripts are on virtual variable that mean all script need to rewrite all variable in .as
but some class as file not need for do that.

Now I know how I could ADD a new AS-Script to a SWF File Like this.
But I got two problems atm...

At the first, for adding new Scripts:
[http://forum.worldoftanks.eu/index.php? ... -rabcdasm/](http://forum.worldoftanks.eu/index.php?/topic/287391-tutorial-editing-actionscript-in-as3-swf-files-for-wot-088-with-rabcdasm/)
With this tutorial (and some selfscripting) I'm possibly able to ADD new scripts to the swf.
But now, I encountered this Problem: 
[](http://abload.de/image.php?img=thisx1ru2r.png)
I tried to recompile the main.asasm back to .abc, but The Path seems to be too long...
Anyone knows how I can bypass this limitation?

At the second: Anyone knows how I can ADD new Images/Pictures to an existing swf and link it to a as-script? (like this)

I need to know how I can de- and recompile files like this because I`m able to add removed Gamemodes back as "Custom Game" Mode then.
