- Post Title: Continent of the Ninth (.r3cb, .r3cm, .r3ce)

Download link: [http://www.webzen.com/Download/C9](http://www.webzen.com/Download/C9)
All of the game data is contained in .cfs archives, which can be unpacked by a tool, but I'm not sure whether it's allowed to link to the site it's on. You can google "cfs extract" and you should be able to find it easily though.

Inside .cfs archives for models, you get .r3cb, .r3cm, and .r3ce files. Pretty sure .r3cb holds bone info, .r3cm are meshes, and .r3ce are animations.

There have been a few threads on this game before, but they've all been dead for a while, and I'd rather not necro. Apparently Chrrox made an 3ds max importer for the r3cb files and r3cm back in 2010, but it appears to be outdated; the current models don't import properly. Any chance of getting an updated importer?

I'd rather have just one topic for a game rather than having to search around different topics about the same game.

Most threads get abandoned anyways by their respective starters so it doesn't really make a difference whether someone else decides to pick up a project or not.
