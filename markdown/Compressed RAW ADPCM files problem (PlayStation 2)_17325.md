- Post Title: Compressed RAW ADPCM files problem (PlayStation 2)

Hello and good time of day.
Okay, well, I have a trouble ripping music from Scooby-Doo! Unmasked game, PlayStation 2 and GameCube versions.
The thing is that music reads up with PSound and MF Audio just perfectly except one little thing: past half second repeats  every second, like, back and forth. There's original .INT file and extracted WAV file: [http://www.mediafire.com/file/tvrbdi4c1 ... MUW3L5.rar](http://www.mediafire.com/file/tvrbdi4c1mzq3z6/MUW3L5.rar)

The original files were in .INT format, which I belive is some type of archive. As I mentioned, PSound and MF Audio did their job right, exctracting RAW PCM from .INT file, but I can't get audio from .INT in the GameCube verison, due to lack of tools that can rip GameCube audio files from other files.

So, I am not quite sure why this happens and how to fix those files. I hope someone can shed light on how to solve this problem.
