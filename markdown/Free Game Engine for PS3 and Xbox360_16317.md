- Post Title: Free Game Engine for PS3 and Xbox360

Hello guys, 

I just would like to invite you to know my modified version of UDK (Unreal Development Kit) Engine. I was able, with the help of other folks (programmers and game developers) to add support for consoles, PS3 and Xbox360. So now ANYONE can create homebrew games for free (not commercially) and play it on any PS3 with Custom Firmware and on any hacked Xbox360 (RGH or JTAG).

This is a project I am working from 2 years, and now it`s "officialy released". I also added some enhancements on the engine, some small improvements over original UDK Engine. 

Here is the engine`s website where you can download for free:

Here is the Release Trailer and Youtube Channel:
