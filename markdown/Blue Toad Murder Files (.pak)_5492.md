- Post Title: Blue Toad Murder Files (*.pak)

Hi.
I'm looking to translate this puzzle game, but I don't know how extract texts data, maybe someone can I help me?

Besides this attached file with text, there are "Global.pak" files (200 mb aprox.), one for Episode, with graphics and others, I suppose.
Thank you very much.

The texts are in lua scripts (compiled ones), so you should find someone who is an expert in lua.
