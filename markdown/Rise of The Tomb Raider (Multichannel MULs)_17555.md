Hi there!!!

Could you please help me to extract MULs from the 'cinstream' folder? I used the program ([viewtopic.php?p=116208#p116208](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?p=116208#p116208)), but it doesn't extracts the data. I just need to extract the music from the all FMVs. If you need I could send you the one of MUL files here.

Thanks!!!
