Hi, i'm trying to decryp this AWB file to convert the audio to WAV, but there's no way to unpack it! how can i do it?

Tried rename it to CPK, but nothing

Not really sure if thats an audio file, cause there's one with 312mb and that maybe its the real AWB audio file, anyways, cant unpack any of them.. You guys know how can i do it? :S

It is from NUNS3
