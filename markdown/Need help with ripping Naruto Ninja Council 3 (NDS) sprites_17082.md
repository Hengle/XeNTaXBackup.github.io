- Post Title: Need help with ripping Naruto Ninja Council 3 (NDS) sprites

Hello to all.
I have no luck on ripping sprites from this game. I used Tinke, Console Tool, Tile Molester and such programs. But no correct formats or image showed up.
Maybe someone who succeeded in these type of situations or knows what I should do?
I don't know if it is possible to rip them directly from game like that. If only screenshotting method can be used, the answer will be useful too.
