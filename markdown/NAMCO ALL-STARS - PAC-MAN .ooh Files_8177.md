- Post Title: NAMCO ALL-STARS - PAC-MAN .ooh Files

This sound file is used in the game NAMCO ALL-STARS - PAC-MAN. Could someone help me convert it to a .wav file? Download: [http://www.mediafire.com/download.php?dye66v9s11q9cyv](http://www.mediafire.com/download.php?dye66v9s11q9cyv)

These are completely standard Ogg Vorbis files, just rename them from .ooh to .ogg and they will play anywhere.
