The 3D Object Converter supports the Luna Online .mod file format for load.
[http://web.t-online.hu/karpo](http://web.t-online.hu/karpo)

Please install the v4.40 or use the v4.40 portable version.
After that you must upgrade to the latest version (v4.420) using the Help/Check for updates... function.

See this nice gallery (original .mod and the converted Wavefront .obj/mtl files):

Well this opens the .mod files great. But when I went to save the files it appears that pretty much any format you would typically use isn't saveable in the free version. I'd rather not spend the money to unlock those formats and I'm not resorting to warez.

Is there a format I could save to and open in another free program that just isn't used as often that anyone knows of? Or if anyone knows any information on this format could you possibly write a simple converter to something like .obj, .3ds, .smd something frequently used?

Thanks for any help you can give me I'm looking into this while I wait as well.

Yes i was interested too, but ´ve accustomed to trial versions 
to have more functions than to work none as a model viewer 
I know that the idea is to prevent a user using this product ONLY for once
and never use it again thus to limited export options, but in my point of view
Karpo´s actually alienating customers, you never know after the 30 days fully funtional
trial period who´ll return.
And from a customers point of view I would never buy a product based on this limited
trial and based only by the authors words: it works, look, here´s the gallery.
40 € is a sh*tload money for an indie developer (temporalily unemployed) as I am.
Karpo, there´s no pun intented just a suggestions for making your product marketing even better 

Cheers !
