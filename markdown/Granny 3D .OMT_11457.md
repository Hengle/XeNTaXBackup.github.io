- Post Title: Granny 3D .OMT

A lot of the games by AWE Games have their 2D graphics in a .omt file. They also have audio, which I can extract, but I want to extract the graphics. Everything's all skewed and twisted in TextureFinder, and nothing I can find can extract them. Here's some samples from Jimmy Neutron vs. Jimmy Negatron:

I looked at the Granny SDK and it has nothing, and I already have the model viewer. It's not the models I care about, it's the 2D graphics. Maybe it's not a normal Granny format, but a format specifically made by AWE Games.
