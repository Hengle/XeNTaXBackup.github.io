- Post Title: Detroit Become Human: Subtitles file to edit

Has any way to edit one of this file and find the subtitles? They're encode files



I don't know much about programming language, but I could try it.

Your bigfile is splitted, so you probably need to merge it into one file and then 
figure out filenames/offsets using IDX file. Then you could unpack it and search for texts.

So I've merge all those files, 27 in total. Now how do I figure out those filenames/offsets using IDX file? Has a specific tool for it?
