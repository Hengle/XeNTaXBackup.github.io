I'm looking for as many models as possible for these two games. Does anyone have any models they can share with me or any links they can
pass on that I can check out?

Sorry for not being specific, but I'm trying to find a way to open the .kmd files for ninja gaiden black and I am able to at least extract the textures from the doa models so I'm just looking for models for doa games and how to open the .kmd files so any help is appreciated.
