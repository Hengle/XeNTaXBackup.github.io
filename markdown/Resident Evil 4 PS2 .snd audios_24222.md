- Post Title: Resident Evil 4 PS2 .snd audios

Hi there, guys.
I am currently modding the PS2 version of Resident Evil 4, the sound files of this version are completely different if compared to the other versions (2007, UHD).
The .snd files contain several compressed .vag (or .raw) sounds inside of it, I am able to extract them using HxD editor, however it takes a lot of time if I would be doing this for every sound that I need to edit.

I am here to ask if someone can help me to make a script to extract the all the sounds at once and repacks them back. If that isn't possible, I wish someone tell me in which topic can I learn to do that, please.
I know almost everything about this file from HxD: starting offset, ending, size of each sound, padding, quantity, frequencies in Hz, so maybe it won't be so hard to achieve.

Thanks.

This probably won't help with repacking (not my area of interest usually), but this QuickBMS script will extract all of the sounds from the .snd files.

There are about 11,000+ files in total.  It should get you a start at least.
