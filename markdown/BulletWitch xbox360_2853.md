Why did you bother? There's a Bullet Witch Python script in Noesis that already supports everything with skeletons, weighting, and material/texture data.

thx for all the work you do on noesis first of all,

i'm totally new to this, and am wondering how to execute the python script from noesis to extract models/textures/bones from bullet witch... and which file i should have extracted for noesis to execute this script on.

thank you
