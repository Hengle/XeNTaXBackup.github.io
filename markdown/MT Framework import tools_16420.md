It's for 3ds max 2017 SP3, sorry I forgot to mention that.

The best way is to try it yourselves and post result, if it's throwing errors I'd be happy to receive samples, so I can modify it.

Yes, of course, I would like to, more games it supports, the better.

You're using pl1500 model, but I don't know what animation file and animation ID you're using. 
Anyway if you followed tutorial, it should work like charm. I noticed that legs are little rotated but thats becouse of IK solver.
I still don't know where IK links are stored, they may be hardcoded in game or stored in LMT files, I didn't research them completely...

Tool Seems to be working fine for me with Devil May Cry 4 PC, but I haven't been able to find the animations that accompany the female Player models (Trish, Lady, Gloria) does anyone know where they are?

Thanks for the great work!

Actually i am using enemy wesker animations. But as i looked through animations his TO IDLE transitions seem to place his leg this way as well. I guess thats how he is animated wich is weird cause i dont remember seeing him like that. Anyway tool works wich is good 

I will try to look up wesker player animations

I am Actually Surprised to announce that The Merce 3D Animations Kinda Work!

That neck is interesting. But that might just not be the skeletons adding up (Cant test Proper Merce 3d models since they cant be imported)


EDIT!
Most of them Actually Work well!

for Dragon's Dogma it imports the models, but not 100% correct it seems?
and I wasn't able to load the animation for the model I tried it on.
(the model I tried was one of the types of Harpies)
picture (linked to it because 4k resolution image would clutter the page too much) :

it didn't give me an error trying to load the animation, it just made 3ds max lock up completely for me.

EDIT:
Resident Evil 0 Remaster seems to work just fine as well!
RE0:
[https://abload.de/img/re01xul8.png](https://abload.de/img/re01xul8.png)
edit 2: 
some player models seem to have issues similar to the lost plannet models from the top post.
...
Resident evil Revelations (3ds) doesn't load model files, but the animation files work with the PC models

very good, i was wondering if there's any chance to add the export back support, i knew that someone made a script to export models back into the MT Framework games, but they were for the old versions of Max and the only way to get them is via piracy, could it be added into the future? anyway, good job here.

Dragons Dogma might use new version animation blocks, it also handles mesh face differently than other versions. 
I'll be glad if I receive some samples.

MT Framework features shared animation system, that means animation set for one character will work for another aswell.

Weapons and hands animations are separated.

MT Framework doesn't use morph targets, everything is animated via bones.

That is indeed correct,
games like, RE6 , REV2, RE1 & 0 HD all use this method for animation hands. (A little annoying)

So, I had looked on pl models from RE6 and they use mesh presets. 
Apologies, I have never imported any pl model from MTF2 games, so I assumed they use bones like rest.

It's a shot in a dark, but did you tried to load weapon animation itself to playermodel? Just a guess, I cannot test it now.

i will try to look there. for now i am focused on wesker boss. and he doesnt have all melee moves... rest is on player one i suppose. and funny thing skeletons arent the same...

yes arent same skeletons... half of the moves are missing... but they are ingame....

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvhQY1BOpMs&t=411s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvhQY1BOpMs&t=411s)

for instance in this video tiger uppercut is done. while in wesker boss animations there are no tiger uppercut move. and if i try to put playr tiger uppecut, my skeleton is all messed up. i am confused

I don't know about wesker boss, but in the case of player hand animations they're located in the same file as the rest of the weapon animations...

idle animation:
[https://i.gyazo.com/f86184c6de42c584691 ... 9ab53c.jpg](https://i.gyazo.com/f86184c6de42c584691ee8cdcf9ab53c.jpg)

idle with hand poses applied over it:

these came from Pl00wp02.lmt
with the first sequence ID being the idle animation and the last sequence animation being the pose for both hands...

edit: 
Boss wesker has hands in for some of his animations...
so I'm not sure which animations mwesten1 was talking about

BETA 2 has been released.

Added MOD support for Mercenaries 3d, Dragon's Dogma and Capcom vs Marvel 3 (UCvsM3)
Fixed inverted faces for pc versions
Added full support for Resident Evil 6 skinned models.
Added support for 64 bit versions (so far UCvsM3 only as I know)
Fixed Dragons Dogma animations to be loadable, but wrongly offsetted (rotations only, not known fix for now).
Note: UCvsM3 animations can be loaded, but thats all.

I'm deeply grateful for the fact that the Steam Version of Ultimate Marvel Vs Capcom 3 is getting model love. I really am, but there are some problems that need to be resolved before the modding community for the game can use these models for anything outside of texture previews.

The big thing is that the skin information isn't correct. The rigs come out are wrong and it's especially noticeable on dangly parts, such as Capes, Jackets, tails, etc. And considering that this is a game with Superheroes and Supervillians........


Here's an example using Frank West and his Camera. The bone I'm moving is only supposed to move the Camera and Strap.



And here he may as well have a Queen Bee bursting out like the alien baby burst out of Ripley.

There's more(animations and exports), but I want to take this one step at a time.

I'm sure because on the model I ripped of Frank West from the PS3 version(which is practically identical due to matching poly count) that I have, via Noesis, that bone does not move his chest.



You can see this problem is present in Frank's Jacket bones too, but not the PS3 model.

This is not Compiled plugin, its maxscript. 

I said it's written under 2017 version becouse I don't have other versions, so I cannot test it, it may or may not work for older versions, but I think it should work for 2018, 2015, 2014 and maybye 2013 and 2012.
It definitely won't work for 2011 and older versions.

Something that perhaps may be a bit easier to figure out: MRL Files. 
It is our understanding that mrl files contain things such as model shading/overlays/colors etc. For example, on a Dr. Doom texture, even if you texture his tunic to be neutral grey, it still has a greenish sheen. This is due to the MRL files? Any info you can provide on this and perhaps a way to read the data in a way that we can make sense of would be great.

EDIT: Perfect example 
In this texture, his hair, the hair below his headband and his eyebrows are all the exact same yellow, gradient and all. However, the game has some kind of model coloration for his hair and eyebrows (black). Changing the texture has little effect and looks off.

It's called cell shading.

Importer doesn't have material loader. Every material must be set manually. Anyone who understands how they work, should easily make same or even better looking materials.

List may change during time.

Tool is written under 3ds max 2017 SP3

Detailed information and tool download.

This is such a good news, but can this tool import animation only? Can it export back animation to game? Or we can only import for fun and can not mod the game?

There is another thread about RE animation, but only import. not export back.

Why is it hard to export the animation back to the game? Is there some coding of Capcom that prevent us from doing that?

When exporting stuff out you can get away not knowing 100% of all structures in the format, in most cases this won't work out for writing back into the format. So if you attempt to do this without knowing everything about the format it might not work or require a lot of time to make sure the game reads the animation properly. Its all possible but very time consuming.

I own Dead Rising 1 on Steam and have the assets extracted.
I can confirm that the models do not work with the script at all right now.
Trying to import models with 64 bit architecture checked or not results in the error "- Unknown Property: "children" in undefined.
Trying to import it without importing the mesh results in 3DS Max hanging.

So yeah, to those who asked about Dead Rising 1, here you go.

Why must we need to know everything about writing back? We can just know basic thing, the topic owner can write some script and other people will try it. Some animation may work, some may not work, but we will work gradually to improve it. 
There is a topic in [http://residentevilmodding.boards.net/t ... r-tutorial](http://residentevilmodding.boards.net/thread/5156/creating-animation-smdtofcv-converter-tutorial)
They made some basic progress, modding animation (animation that does not rotate the camera such as weapon aimng, but anim such as walking is still impossible).

Duuude your work rocks so much, thank you for it. BUT, haha, I am kinda stick with the ik. Your help page doesn't go in as much detail as I think I need. when I import animation for umvc3 characters, several bones go haywire. Obviously meaning that they have ik parameters. But I am unclear as to exactly which bones and how many I am supposed to apply the ik restraints. 

I am also a bit unclear on how the sequencer related. When I create one, it creates a triangular shape that Im not sure where to put or what to do with. maybe it is not part of the reason that the bones end up in different area codes when applying the animation but Im sure Im not handling that aspect perfectly either. It seems that it is only specifically for the import not for how the animation appears so is irrelevant after import?

Still, super dope, all your work.

Here is an example of what I am seeing every time I load an animation. Every model drops below the ground plane and crushes  into itself. Every model, every animation. Which is now making me think that it is not user error, as it doesn't matter what configuration I import the model and animation with, they all result the same. 

I hope it is user error, perhaps you can tell me if that is the case? If you have time it would be dope if you could check out the max file I'm linking to below and tell me what the issue is. Thanks.

Hi, first i would like to say thanks for the awesome work you did here. This tool is really amazing!
I´m having an issue when trying to export some models  with animations from 3DS Max using FBX plugin, for some strange reason  they lost texture coordinates and uv´s are all messed up after loading the FBX files  in any other 3D application outside 3DS MAX.
 I noticed  this only happens with models from games that use LOD system , like RE5, RE6, Revelations 2,  and DMC4 SE. models from games without LOD system, like RE HD Remaster and Dragon´s Dogma are exported to FBX format perfectly, another thing that  i noticed is that only meshes with duplicated names have issues, meshes that don´t have duplicated names are exported with correct UV´s

I have tried import model from RE6 with 2 uv channels into Unreal 4 and all works just fine.
Thing is that your "other 3D app" cannot handle multiple uv channels, instead it will combine them together. I depends on app.
Another thing is that "other app" uses older version of FBX importer/plugin, thus makes some undesirable results.
Since you don't want to share name of app, I cannot help you more.

Hey!

Sorry to ask,
I'm trying to understand how the IK Chain section of this tool. I read the section about IK's for the toes, and I know how to solve that, but I'm trying to understand how to apply it to the upper body/hands.

I am testing this with the Revelations 2 PC version, with the .arc extracted by Noesis and the .lmt's in it. I think the Arc is pl2260

Right now, I'm getting this result: [https://gfycat.com/DeficientFakeLamb](https://gfycat.com/DeficientFakeLamb) which I assume is an IK Link issue,

Could someone explain how IK Links work or what I should use the Create IK Link button on?

I know for the feet, it's both toes -- but what would it be for the arms?

Thanks so much

For arms, its usually hand bone. It's the bone where fingers are connected to, if model have finger bones. In case of RE games, most hands doesn't have finger bones, since they are using predefined meshes, so in that case it should be last bone on each arm.

Hi Predator,

Thank you so much for the reply! 

In the case of the last bones, do I select the last bone both on the right side and the left side of the arm together and Create the IK Link, or do I do it separately for each side?

Just incase, [https://mega.nz/#!F2RygTyR!IVotGdCYuW_8 ... LVYKf7nkKU](https://mega.nz/#!F2RygTyR!IVotGdCYuW_8eWjL7uMpwtiq5WOH7BAQBLVYKf7nkKU)
Here's a Max scene and .mod's, etc. 

I tried doing the end bones on the left and right side together, but it doesn't seem to be working. 

I notice that instead of the arm being in a different position, it seems to stretch like this -- [https://i.imgur.com/ha6Kfjc.png](https://i.imgur.com/ha6Kfjc.png) 

I'm very sorry if I'm doing it wrong. Hopefully I can learn how 

Thank you again, sincerely.

Hi, 

I'm not sure if this is a possible issue with the tool.
Highflex and I were trying to figure out what was going on.

Are you sure the IK is being aligned properly? We may be wrong, but do the arms in Resident Evil Revelations 2 have IK?

Right now, what we're doing to test is - 

1. Select the ones which have hands skinned to them and add a "_" tag in front.
2. Unparent the child bones of the hand and rename them to the hand names.

The only thing you are missing is the hand rotation which you can copy from the unparented nodes.

[https://i.imgur.com/knWuV2X.gifv](https://i.imgur.com/knWuV2X.gifv) This is the result, which is the fixed animation.. not 100% perfect but this works.. might help in finding the problem.

Hello there, Hands definitely have IK.
Thing is that IK's are not fully researched, unfortunetly, I might look at them in future and give them second shot.
This hand issue is familiar to me very well, they are using offset, so control bones doesn't have same possition as their child ones.
Creating IK's are complicated thing and they are using many things to actually get them to work at all.
However, using offsetted control bone will result in artifacts, since rotation will cause them.
3ds max have some strict IK limitations, for example no rotations and additional control over IK chain at all.

Sorry, cannot help you more so far.

Hi! I'm using this tool with RE6 PC, and here's the issues I've encountered:


The same anim works fine for the separate hand files(they have finger bones), but they're in the wrong positions
relatively to the upper body part, as shown on the left side of the picture.

Besides, since different body parts share same bone names while the same anim can still be applied to them correctly,
like, say the head and the upper body, is it possible to load all parts together at a time instead of loading anims
separately for different parts then merging them into one scene automatically renaming all overlapping names?

You can save multiple bodyparts as max files, and them merge them together.
All those problems described indicates its a skin glitch, might look at it in future.
It would be nice if you'll post arc name, is it figure or pl model with figure animation? Thx.

Yeah, that's what I'm doing for such case now. Limitation is that you can't see the big picture for the whole animation.
That will work though.  

> Reply from PredatorCZ

Sure. That is, uPl06AdaA.arc for body, uPl06HeadAdaA for head, uWp1061.arc for the gun in her hand, and fig06.arc for posture animation
of that figure. Separate corresponding hand files are uPl06HandLeftAdaA.arc and uPl06HandRightAdaA if it's needed. 
I think there're no static figures as shown in the collection in game but just figure animations. I've also tested some animations from the
same arc file of the body, the skin glitch issue also occurred.

Tested the 3DS version of Resident Evil Revelations, and it appears some of the rigging is wrong. [https://i.imgur.com/r2sFJV8.png](https://i.imgur.com/r2sFJV8.png)


The Leg Bones (3,4,6,7) all pull at the opposites vertexes, while bone12 seems to pull at an awkward part of the green walkie talkie thing, and the hair bones (20,21,22) pull at part of the back.


It might just be an error with my version of 3ds max(2015), but just in case it isn't. Sample if needed: [https://mega.nz/#!IxIjiT7J!b53jbidSbMb0 ... Y3Kg6X4UkY](https://mega.nz/#!IxIjiT7J!b53jbidSbMb0wUVgWOuGQ3bb5fRXvBANlY3Kg6X4UkY)

Glad to see that you've solved it so quickly.  
BTW, have you ever looked at those separate hand files? Can their positions be corrected? Or is that the way it was?

It wouldn't be impossible, it would be just slow process since maxscript is extremly slow. 
But LMT have some unknown data to me, it uses events as well. 
LMT is NOT final process for animation, MT Framework uses so called "Animation Mixer" tool, whinch I am unable to locate assets for it (I was hoping they are in sdl or xfs format), but they seems to be nativized in-game.
This Animation Mixer works exactly like Animation Blueprint in UE4.

It will be solved in IK overhaul, in BETA 3. Since IK on hands are not working in current version.

Does that mean it'd take debugging to progress further? Also, if it comes to making an exporter, isn't a compiled plugin through the sdk an option?
Thanks for the answers.

Edit: not sure if i'll add anything new, but these LMTs contain attack data as well as motion. We got a tool, that extracts them as .mot and .atk [http://www.mediafire.com/file/i5kiwxc4c ... l+v1.0.zip](http://www.mediafire.com/file/i5kiwxc4c4eibfe/RE6+LMT+Tool+v1.0.zip)

It's not compiled plugin, its maxscript, im really tired of explaining theese over and over again.

Those are not attack data, they are events, they trigger any action at certain time in animation, like play sound, spawn particle emitter and so on.

I know yours is a script, but max has a c++ sdk and lets you make compiled plugins, which do their job much faster, needless to say. So my question is whether or not you're willing to do ditch maxscript. But either way, we're already waiting for export with the script we got and waiting is better than not exporting at all, we'll take anything we can.
Also, thanks for clarifying the .atk.

Since my script is supporting multiple games, sdk plugin would be bad idea to make, since I don't have debug version of max, it would be really hard to debug such thing. sdk plugin does not tell you when something went wrong, it just crashes max.

maxscript -> more error prone, much slower, can be used with any version of max, easy to debug, information riches, you cannot control memory management (you have only free and gc, you are not 100% sure if data you created are truly gone)

plugin -> does not accept errors; much faster; can be used only with one version of max (and that is sdk whinch is built on); if you do not write exeptions yourself, you don't have any debug information whinch can really hard to debug blinded afterwards(also try catch is slow); you must restart 3ds max each time you compile plugin (even if plugin is not loaded in max, max is checking timestamps of plugins on start)

Don't get me wrong, I had idea that I could make a plugin, but I choosed maxscript instead.

Oh, never used the sdk myself, didn't know you have to get a special version to have debugging, is it some cash grab you gotta pay on top? Anyway, waiting is fun, we're used to it.

Good stuff like always  i am using this plugin all the way.

Hey, you mentioned that RE6 is divided in upper and lower body anims. How did you combine it? I remember seeing GIF when enemy from re6 had full motion. How did you do it. 

P.S. Just a quick request, can you make it work on Max 2018

Hello, i test tools to Ace Attorney dual destinies (IOS version) models, tool load pretty good models and animations, but sequel (Spirit of Justice) have simular files systems, but can't load models and animations, 3ds Max was freezed.

And the models from Ultimate Marvel vs Capcom 3 (PC) loads also well, but here with the upload of animation problems, the model twists and exhibits a strange movement. I will wait when it will be possible to load them normally. Good luck in updating script!

Only games I wrote are fully tested/supported, attempting to load assets from unsupported games might lead to unexpected behaviour.

I wrote that animations from UMvC3 can be loaded, but are wrong, this game seems to use different animation system from others. That would might require new importer, and I don't think I'll make one only for this one case.

could you separate list of wich game animation supported? because it's not clear from all the details you provided. or I'm blind   
like so, maybe: Dragons Dogma Dark Arisen | animation (ANM) / model (MOD)
thank you

also, what hides behind "...over 20 new model formats for MTF v2"?

Appreciated Tosyk. 
I did not added list for animation formats, because tool can load all of them. 
About those formats, MT Framework v2 engine uses hashed block format to store vertex data. All I researched so far were character models, so I added some new ones, so tool can load static meshes and even maps now. So if you had loaded only half model in the past, you can load full now, pretty much.

Good Job mate, this "script" works good without errors or any problems, can I ask you? Do you have something progress with export of animations or models? yeah I know there is MOD by codeman that registered on modding boards, but exporter is not fresh and not and is buggy for me. Well work mate, importing animations from RE0 works good. Sorry for bad English.

MT Framework can use any animation on any model. 
His walking animations will be stored in different LMT.

I might be doing something wrong but, since beta 2 I've been unable to use the import all option for animations.

In beta 2 it worked right with Sequencer, but in beta 3 & 4 when I click on load to import them all, it just load for a couple seconds and then nothing happens. Even worse the script window becomes unresponsive, every option I try to click just return a win warning sound and I'm forced to restart the tool.

Importing individual animations works well tho but not the import all option.

Awesome work and tool.
Is it possible to consider an option for export? I mean, maybe we can exchange through the animation for the game, for example, export from RE Merc 3D to RE5.

Try this tool [https://github.com/mhvuze/WorldChunkTool/releases](https://github.com/mhvuze/WorldChunkTool/releases)
It extracts the bin and gives you a PKG file.

Extract the PKG contents with the same tool.
Works perfectly.

I'm guessing the .mod3 files are the mesh and .tex are the textures. But the mod3s don't load with this MT tool for 3ds and I have no clue how to convert the textures. Any help would be appreciated either through DMs or here.

Yeah I figured that out but I'm at a wall now. I'm guessing the .mod3 files are the mesh and .tex are the textures. But the mod3s don't load with this MT tool for 3ds and I have no clue how to convert the textures. Any help would be appreciated either through DMs or here.


Works fine for me. The bigger mod3 files seem to just crash 3ds max.

Make sure to turn 64 bit architecture on.

I was absolutely forgetting that and now I feel dumb. Thank you man! You have any clue how to get the textures working? Never worked with .tex before personally.

Nope. This is mostly uncharted territory. Could probably try using a quickBMS script

Try following the steps on this website, it has a small guide on fixing that [https://lukascone.wordpress.com/2017/06 ... ork-tools/](https://lukascone.wordpress.com/2017/06/18/mt-framework-tools/)

Stuff like this. (Showing in blender as its harder to see in 3ds)

I'm not importing animations. only meshes, so the instructions there don't matter too much as far as i can see

The tool imports LODs, they should be arranged in layers by default. Leave only lowest LOD number layer active and it should show you only the highest model detail.

Follow up to this, this tool apparently converts .tex files to .dds:

I can attest to that, also. I wound up using [this tool](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=18&t=16461) instead, and it works decently. The textures are missaligned but its not difficult to realign them. The tool seems to have Issues with normal maps, too, which is a bummer.

In the meantime for the texture you could use this noesis script

[https://www.dropbox.com/s/cs4iw3jjfw8bv ... X.rar?dl=1](https://www.dropbox.com/s/cs4iw3jjfw8bvvv/tex_MonsterHunterWorld_TEX.rar?dl=1)

It opens pretty much every texture except some that are still messed up (works for normal maps)

Even tho you might have to resize some normal maps which is pretty easy to do

Not every texture uses BC1 compression, normal maps will use BC5.

A friend of mine found the script but it seems like it can't open the BM file

That's what i managed to do with some retexturing on some part (and i swapped the head because i can't get the hair texture to work)

ok,direct upload a noesis py  file (after fixed),xx_RMT.tex use BC7_??? like eye_RMT.tex
	elif imgFmt == 0x1E or imgFmt == 0x1F:
		data = rapi.imageDecodeDXT(data, imgWidth, imgHeight, noesis.FOURCC_BC7)
		texFmt = noesis.NOESISTEX_RGBA32

if you want to Rawtex.exe , "npc002_hair_BM.tex" as example   , the  0x108 get from the "npc002_hair_BM.tex" data offset 0xB8 

take care，sometimes Rawtex.exe will output a ”dx10“ header DDS, (DDS_FOURCC，Any DXGI format ,mainly DXGI_FORMAT_R10G10B10A2_UNORM ) it's too new!  [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/window ... dds-pguide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/direct3ddds/dx-graphics-dds-pguide)

Has anyone come across this problem with the animation file?

I managed to import Nergigante model( file is em103_00) to 3ds Max with no problem. Texture so far no problem, but when I tested the animation files, the left wings seems to have missing animation keys. The selected area shown in the picture is the bones with missing keys. 

Hope someone can help. Many thanks in advance.

I'm currently trying to port the 3dsmax-script to blender(you could actually unpack the "MT Framework.mzp" file with 7zip):

[https://github.com/TheCrazyT/BlenderMhwModelImporter](https://github.com/TheCrazyT/BlenderMhwModelImporter)

Any help is welcome.
Wonder why they have so many different formats for model files   
Those MODVertexBuffer* classes can drive you insane.

I'm currently trying to port the 3dsmax-script to blender(you could actually unpack the "MT Framework.mzp" file with 7zip):

https://github.com/TheCrazyT/BlenderMhwModelImporter

Any help is welcome.
Wonder why they have so many different formats for model files   
Those MODVertexBuffer* classes can drive you insane.

You said you could unpack the framework with 7zip.How would i use it to import into blender? Or would i need your script for it?

I unpacked it to get the source code to be able to port it to my python script.
(wich currently only contains rudimentary stuff)

Relatively minor gripe, but I've been having issues with messing with the skeletons of models imported with this tool. For whatever reason, the scaling of bones is not inherited by their children (ie. if I scaled an arm bone, the hands would stay the same size), which means I cannot scale the whole model down by shrinking the root bone. Is there some sort of setting I need to turn on, or is there a script of some sort that can fix this?

Mega Man 11 on PC uses the MT Framework engine, so would it be possible to update the tools to be able to work with it? I have samples for you guys to work with: [https://www.dropbox.com/s/r92k3mmh29u01ha/obj.rar?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/r92k3mmh29u01ha/obj.rar?dl=0)

Let me know if anything else is needed.

If not, are you planning on updating the tool ?

The tool is only for games running on MT Framework engine.
The last game on this engine was MHW.
After that, engine was dropped completely.
RE7, RE2, DMC5 (and any upcoming titles) will be running on new RE Engine.

Question:
I was testing the MHW models (NPC), but, after import the main body and later import the head, all the bones of the body get erase and replace by the head ones.

It does happen the same with Dragon Dogma armors when trying to import chest and later legs part.

Unless, I'm importing them wrong...

You must import each bodypart as one MAX scene/file. You can merge them into single scene later.

I wonder why I didn't try that before.
I kind hope the head get on the correct position in the case of MHW.

Thanks btw!

I've been loving this tool for a little bit now, but 3ds Max has been really screwing up lately. Initialization issues, which lead to reinstalls, which lead to missing files while installing, and am now currently reaching our data cap for the month so i'd like to avoid downloading 3ds max again.

 Is there any update for the whole tool working with blender and not just MHW? Specifically I've been using it for MHGU - which is basically MHXX - and working with the .mod files. I'll eventually mess with MHW, but not quite yet.

And on another note. When everything was working, i noticed that the normals were messing up with MHGU .mod files. It wasn't too hard fixing those so no real big problem.

Edit: Found the issue. Somehow some dll file got deleted from system32. Probably when uninstalling / reinstalling 3ds max or the c++ redistributables... i don't know. Still a great tool to use, but still having issues with MHGU models not having correct normals, but it's not too much to fix.

Hey, first of all, I'd like to thank you for these tools, they've been really useful to me, so, thanks!

Second, I have .mod models from the mobile game Monster Hunter Explore, from what little research i could do, the format didn't seem too different from the one used in 3DS Monster Hunter titles, would you be interested in adding support for it? I can supply a bunch of .mod and .lmt files from it if you are.

I am aware that there's a 3ds max script specifically made for it on these very forums, but it's far from the functionality of your toolset.

Thanks again for all the work you've done on this!

Does anyone know if there's been any progress with Ultimate Marvel vs Capcom 3's .LMT animation files? I've been trying to get access to them but the only source I've found that can open them is here and the animations are hugely corrupted. I've tried both the PC and PS3 files but the result is the same for animations (though the model corrupts on PS3).



Here's what the UMvC3 animations for Phoenix Wright look like in 3DS Max. This video uses the corrupted PS3 model but the animation itself is the same for the PC variation. If anyone has any advice or solutions I'd be very grateful.

This is what I use for converting MHW .tex files.
There's no blue channel because MHW normals don't use the blue channel (it can read the blue channel, but it doesn't actually use it in any models)
Also this is really beside the point of the thread since this is for models, not textures.

I solved my problem using that site!

I have another question.

I am classifying chunk files.

Is their any site or information that tells something about chunk file?
Like what's in chunk0,and what's in chunk1 ...etc

Actually I am looking for player animation and I couldnt find it.
So I want to find where player's animation is located.

Also Is it possible to play player's animation by following mt FrameWorkTool homepage?

I used MT Framework and suceed extracting it, but when I load legmesh and body mesh in 3D MAX

bone becomes like the image I attached.

I think something is wrong about it. Can Any one give me advice?

You will need to import each body part as single scene.
You cannot import multiple models with different bone architectures into a single scene.

Have been using the 3DS Max tool/script with Monster Hunter Generations Ultimate, has worked like a charm so far, a bit of a learning curve as it's far out of my usual realm of game modification and unpacking. I've only had one "issue"/suggestion if such is possible;

Loading models, super easy. Loading animations from an .lmt, also really easy. Took me a while to notice that multiple animations are stored in each file, via the "Selected ID", but no problems there, Capcom seems to be very tidy with this stuff. The only "issue" has been with having to regenerate the skeleton before changing every animation. Could this be an issue specifically with MHGU, or is this a general thing that has to be done for loading animations? Would it be possible to, automatically or via toggle/checkbox, Regenerate Skeleton before loading a new animation? 

Saves a mere single click, but if I forget to regenerate the skeleton [and I do, when I'm not in the zone], the animations sometimes take a while to load, and would save some time. Very QoL, but that aside the script has worked flawlessly, thank you very much for the work and effort.

I've always wonder, but how do you fix Normals on 3D Max? because manuality it is not exactly the right chose when it has hundred of normals...
I ask, because this tool at times import the models all mess up and I cannot use Blender, because it always export on the wrongest way as .FBX
