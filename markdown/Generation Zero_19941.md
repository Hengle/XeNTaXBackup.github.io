- Post Title: Generation Zero

Hello everyone !

I am trying to get my hands on those sweet robot 3D models from Generation Zero but unfortunately, I have little knowledge about file extraction.

This game recently came out, so I assume no tools exist for it just yet, but it was made by Avalanche Studios using the Apex Engine which, from what I understood, was also used in Just Cause 4.

The game files consist of pairs of ".arc" and ".tab" files.

Thanks to Aluigi's help on Zentax, I was able to unpack them using QuickBMS and the script from theHunter:CotW game. Now I just have a plethora of .dat, .aaf, .avt files as well as some other formats.

Does anyone have any clue on how to get the coveted 3D models out of this mess ? Thank you !
