Haay does anyone know how to get the textures and models from the game apex legends? I saw in the game folder are Starpak and rpak files. 
When I googled then I found many entries to titanfall 2 but no real solution to unpack the rpak or starpak files.  

The game is free so everyone can download it and check the files by his own.
