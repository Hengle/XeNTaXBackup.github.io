Hello guys, well my reques is not to much because I have unpacker for this game, but the problem is models.pck no work, it give me error when try unpack, so I upload a source of unpacker so maybe can check it, I got a error say this.

PS: I know files can be unpacked with offzip, but offzip unpack all with random names and all in one folder and really format is tottaly different don't know why, this unpacker got all with native format, like:

DDS=Texture
SKI=3D Model
SKT=ANIMATION
BON=BONES
