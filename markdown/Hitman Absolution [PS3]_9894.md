Ekey i know with X360 there is used SDK memcompress method, so i can decompress all files however there still need to be some research about format of the files. I can PM you the decopress files if that gonna help you? I dont know what is the PC and PS3 like but i would guess that is the same.In X360 ver. filenames are like this 477E19813811C7DDE7C4017B719002FA and so on.....

For PS3 maybe if used the same algorithm from PC. Can someone give account from stream version ~at 1-2h with purchased game? Because SHITROW crap version impossible for debugging.

Well i found text. They contained in DD86AFE034044E63A12E35C2FD7C0025.pc_resourcelib (PC version).

Here [Example](http://img853.imageshack.us/img853/8218/hma2012112717460383.png)

PS: Encrypted only INI configs. Anyway for decrypt need steam account with purchased game for debugging and reversing algo if some one needed it.
