Hey guys i'm Taxl, new to this forum. I came from DissidiaForums (A DLC modder), a forum site that is completely gone and i was trying to find of how to extract/repack Dissidia 012 SSCF files (Voice files) but i can't seem to find any solution tho. I used Dissidia moddingsuite.  If any of you guys know how to do it, please help me. Thank you!
