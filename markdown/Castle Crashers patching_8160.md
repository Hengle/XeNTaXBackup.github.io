- Post Title: Castle Crashers patching?

Well, I'm gone so far as to aid in the discovery that the basic Castle Crashers graphics files are simply 'disguised' SWF files. The one thing I cannot figure out how to do however, is 'patch' them with their newest updated graphics. In the link below you will find a rar file containing two folders. One titled 'Original' which contains four files (2 ".pak" 2 ".diff") and one titled 'SWF' where I have converted the .pak files into their respective SWF version. It also contains the same two ".diff" files that I hope can be used to update the swf files or the .pak files. In fact I know they can, as it's how the game patches in question. I just am not sure how it does it. Can someone get these 'two' files together so I can extract the resources I need?

Perhaps you can use [RABCDasm](http://blog.thecybershadow.net/2010/05/05/announcing-rabcdasm/)?

Well, I've never heard of the program but apparently it'd be useful for other things. I've tried several methods using it but no such luck. Thank you for your help though.
