- Post Title: Disney Afternoon Collection .mbundle files?

Hi,

I recently downloaded this collection and noticed an ".mbundle" file for each of the games. I looked at them in a hex editor and it looks like an archive file. It has a bunch of image files listed inside. Anyone know how to extract the files? I can upload a sample if needed.
