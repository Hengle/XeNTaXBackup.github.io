- Post Title: Mitsurugi Trial version. kpk package

A japenese game that made by a company called Zenith Blue(plz google for detail)
It's japenese name called Mitsurugi or "巫剣神威控"
Trial version only has about 110 mb in size.package name called kpk,plz help to extract it.
I can use ninjaripper to rip models,but i decide to study this game.

Here is a picture to help you find the link for downloading if you can't read japenese.
And you have to switch your system language to japenese in order to install this game correctly.




Thank you:)

The file table is in the executable.
They use hashes for the names so that is what i am working on now.
If someone wants to help with this feel free 
here is an extractor for the trial and retail without names.

Try launch the executable with your OS system language in japenese .Some internal registry must be written in different font.

I double click it and nothing happens I had someone else try and the same thing happens.
If I remove the dll it says it cant find it so I know its launching it just does nothing before exiting out.
Does it need to be in a certain path?

You need copy DLL and EXE in game folder.

Edited: Seems problem in MASM compiler because does not currently support Win8. (MIT_log.txt created?)

Edited 2: Any one test logger on Win7?

Are the model files all those .w9o files? I've successfully unpacked the data, but I don't know of anything that can read the files. Will I need something like 3ds Max to do it?

That file may have been outdated anyway, since the Steam version of the game is up to 1.1.2.0 now.  I attached an up-to-date table file here though.  If you need a table for another version, the data is pretty easy to locate in the exe with a hex editor.  Just search for the first 12 bytes from the beginning of the table file, then scroll down until you find the end of the table, which should look visibly different from the table's contents.  Then copy that section of data to a new file.

This unpacker seems to extract most of the files fine, though I noticed that some of them were corrupted, containing raw data from the kpk file instead of their expected contents.  Also, many files are left unnamed and unsorted in the "__Unknown" folder, apparently in need of an updated FileNames.list.
