Hey, could you try and add support for GP500 *.DAT archives?   
Here is an example of the file.
You can find a demo of the game in the BlackholeMotorsports site.
Thanks!

Looks to me like the file you have supplied is in fact not an archive. If I'll get some time on my hands, im gonna download the demo and try to find out something more.

Yes, i´m afraid  you were right, the file is not an archive indeed but some kind of encrypted file. Sorry about that...

Hi, maybe a moderator can move this to the "Compressed files and methods", so maybe someone can help to open this file, please?
Thanks!
