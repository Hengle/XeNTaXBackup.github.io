Hello, maybe I missed something, but Xentax Wiki page is not displaying any graphics. It is just plain old text.

It is down because the mediawiki code needs to be updated, since it is too old for current standards. We do not have the time to do that. Unsure when and if we will.

Is there any possibility to get a backup of wiki?
There were tons of file format documentation. It would be a real shame to loose it all...

I have a wiki backup from this year done by Special pages > Export, so nothing is lost yet.
It is just a XML export of all articles, so no sensitive data like passwords are involved.
If Mr Mouse agrees, I could probably share it publicly here.


BTW, wiki is still up on the server. It just can't render any page, because of the wrong PHP version, so it needs to be updated as it was mentioned earlier.

Do you mind uploading that XML file somewhere so we at least have a separate copy of it? Does that include all of the files or just the text content?

Sure. I've just got approval from Mr Mouse, so I'm happy that I can share it with others. 
Here you go [https://drive.google.com/file/d/16amHfP ... sp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/16amHfPjfL7QagQfnUOGB2mEQQ2qGbywY/view?usp=sharing)

It includes only text content.

Thanks!
Is there any way to make it more readable? Maybe import it to offline wiki or something?

You can try to download Media Wiki software and then setup it on your local host with XAMPP or something similar and then import all articles to your local instance.
Here is the instruction [https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:I ... _MediaWiki](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:Installing_MediaWiki)
