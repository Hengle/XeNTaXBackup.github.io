- Post Title: GBA BlueRoses 3D engine

For those who are unaware, BlueRoses was an engine for the GBA that was capable of rendering 3D polygons. Noteworthy titles include the Resident Evil 2 Tech Demo, Ozzy and Drix, and Smashing Drive.

I was wondering if anybody would be interested in looking into this? I'd really like to get the models from Ozzy and Drix, please.

I made a couple of VRAM dumps using mGBA, can anybody help me in getting the models out of them? Files are attached to this post.

Deleted because the requester doesn't need it.

That just gives me a screenshot of the VRAM dump. I want to get the actual models.
