- Post Title: [Asphalt 8] BGIN, BINX, and JPK Files

Looking at the data, I have found .bgin files, which I believe store the game's graphical files. I want them ripped out so I can see clean images of the outlines of race tracks, car collection images, etc. I have been looking for a way to open them, but I couldn't find any so far. Also, in the "decals" folder, I found "decals.bin.binx" and "decals.jpk".

Does anyone know how to rip the images out of the .bgin files and the files from the decals file I just mentioned? Here's the link to all the files I want ripped (.bgin files + decals.bin.binx and decals.jpk): [https://www.dropbox.com/s/bl2q3whhfites ... 9.zip?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/bl2q3whhfiteskz/gui%20%28includes%20decals%29.zip?dl=0)

Thank you for your help and support.

P.S. The JPK file is just a ZIP file, but I also want the textures from the .decalx files ripped as well.
