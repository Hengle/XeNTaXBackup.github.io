I've found that some 07 pac files works and others dont. Angle and benoit dont work for me but rvd and burchill work fine with a few graphical glitches.

I could see any differences between the files.

if you remap the bone names to the model you are replacing it should work
these models look nice.

Or, if you don't replace a model and just add them to the game they work fine too.  

BTW, I am in the process of adding characters to the game, you must be able to play the game with files changed.  So far I have Stephanie McMahon from SvR2009 added.  It's a slow process to add them, but getting quicker as I progress further.  My next person to add is Ric Flair.  When I have a good amount added, I'll start posting files to do it.

so how would I go about remapping the bone names chrrox? Im sorry if that sounds noobish its just something Ive never done before. And brienj would you be able to add models from 2007 without any problems or is it only the models confirmed to work basically anything after 07? And with your adding method shouldnt the ufc models work as well?

As long as a correct pac file can be created, you could use any model.  Right now I am having a problem with added models.  There is a file contained within that has the AI of the wrestler.  I am trying to find a 2010 model with a smaller one that will fit into older models, but no luck so far.  I even tried to remove it from the models, and no luck with that.  Looks like I am going to have to rebuild the pac files if I want the CPU to play with them too.  The Stephanie McMahon character I added did not have that AI file, and she is playable by the CPU.  That is why I tried to trick the game and replace the AI file with a blank one, but that didn't work.  Still working out the bugs, but it is working great so far.

so brienj how would i go about adding them to the game? rename the pac file to an unused value like chxxx.pac and then edit the chETC.pac file to show the character on the select screen? And why is it that I can replcae certain models like goldust for someone and it works but if I take the same character i replaced goldust with and use it on some other slot it freezes?


ive spent the day trying to find out how to remap the bones on rvd but no luck hope you can point me in the right direction chrrox. I really want to play as some of the 07 models lol

I've noticed that the 09 models have problems with the ai. I've tried 07, 08 and low models and they work perfectly. some 07 models dont work as snyperstyle pointed out.

It's not quite that simple of a method, but you're on the right track.  There are other game files that must be changed too.  Just wait for a tutorial.

That's because the older ones do not contain an AI file, for example, Stephanie McMahon from 2009 can be used by the CPU no problem, because her model does not have the extra file.  Well, I am working on replacing the non-working AI with AI that works, and also putting AI files into models that do not have them.  

Still working on an easy method that is user friendly for everyone.  Once I get the kinks worked out, I'll post some tutorials.

Thanks for working on this, I am looking forward to a tutorial.

I was on there, as well as UTTR's site.  I've pretty much hacked all the wrestling games that I can.

Brienj...

Long time no see!  Glad to know you are still at this type of thing   

We worked together at NH on Outlaw VB.  I was the one who got shawnees images to go black by renaming the image files, and also the one who made Summer bare chested in OL Golf 2 just before the NH site was shut down.  I think you lived in my state of KY at that time?

Anyway, glad to see you around these parts, and hope we can work together on RR XXX and a few others like Onechanbara.

Just getting back into this type of things, and my how times have changed.
