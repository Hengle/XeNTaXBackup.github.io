Hey Mambox! Thanks for the kind words!   I've only got a Wii, Nintendo DS and a medium PC for PK. (Oh and 3 Commodore 64's, 1 Commodore 64 (Boxed), 1 Commodore 128 (Boxed), 1 Commodore Amiga 600 (500, but smaller), 1 Commodore Amiga 500 (Boxed), 1 Commodore VIC20 (Boxed), 1  MSX2 NMS8250, 1 MSX VG8020 (Boxed), 1 Sinclair ZX Spectrum 16K, 1 Sinclair ZX Spectrum 48K (Broken), 1 Sinclair ZX Spectrum 48K (Boxed), 1 Amstrad ZX Spectrum +2 128k (Boxed) and 1 Atari 800XL, but I guess these won't run the new Painkiller really smoothly)
