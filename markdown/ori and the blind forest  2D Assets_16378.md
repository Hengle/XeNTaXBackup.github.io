- Post Title: ori and the blind forest | 2D Assets

Hi all, i Have Ori and the Blind Forest Definitive Edition, and i tried using [Unity Studio](https://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=11807) by Chipicao, to extract the 2D assets, but all i could found is hundreds of blank files that have the exact same size, am i missing anything here?

Thanks for your help..

> am i missing anything here?Hi,
I'm missing some more infos. An uploaded sample, for example, could help.

The thread you've linked to has dozens of pages. Did you read them?
Maybe there's some hint concerning to the loading of 2D assests?

May be a matter of versions:
"Unity Studio now can't work with assets from Unity 5.4"

i looked at your samples with both UnityEx and UnityAssetsBundleExtractor and see
no texture data, only texture headers with or without a reference to another file.

Maybe am stupid! i just noticed that for every .assets file there is a .ress file and .recourse file.. i updated my sample link to include these files..
Am looking for both UnityEx and UnityAssetsBundleExtractor to try my luck with them.. thank you

Thank you a lot UnityEx Worked for me ^_^ ,, i didn't figure out how to use UABE it only gave me to export choices "export as Dump" and "export as RAW"
which am not familiar with.
But UnityEX did the trick, thank you alooooot

  never heard of that before, the download comes with everything the program needs, maybe your download is corrupt?
