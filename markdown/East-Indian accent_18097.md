- Post Title: East-Indian accent

Not long ago I received a voice message. A man with an East Indian accent left it. He introduced himself as Officer James Morrison. I must call him back at the 613-975-9973 number right away otherwise. Thus I get the phone number info [https://canadianareacodes.net/number/16139759973/](https://canadianareacodes.net/number/16139759973/). This project lets me know the phone number that is displayed on my screen telephone.
