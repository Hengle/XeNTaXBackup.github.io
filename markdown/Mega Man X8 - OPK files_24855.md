- Post Title: Mega Man X8 - OPK files

I'm a complete noob at this, so forgive me if my question is stupid. I want to change the title screen logo of mega man x8. I've found a file called logo.opk that I would guess holds it. But I cannot find a program to extract opk files, there's actually barely any information on .opk files at all. The only information I've found on them is a thread from 2008 where someone created a program called GOBREAD which could extract opk files, albeit from a different game. I've treid running it through DOSBOX and extracting the file that way, but to no succes. Does anyone here have any knowledge on how to extract this kind of file? Here's a link to the file:

Your OPK file sample contain multiple raw images.
There is no tool for repacking, but you can at least view it with TextureFinder [https://i.imgur.com/RwRsae9.png](https://i.imgur.com/RwRsae9.png)
