Yes, I have tried it before.
It only works on some old version model.
(parVer == 515 or parVer == 771)

As I said,You need to extract "core321.zip" to folder "noesis\plugins\python\core321.zip\" manually. Otherwise,Noesis may have "IOError: zipimport"

Could you attach a sample file you cannot open with 3D O.C. ?

I think I used an old version 3D O.C.  Now they work fine with the latest version.

Btw, the model and animation are flipped in Y-Axis.  But,I have no idea how to fix it.

Noesis shows error because it read the animation but can't find the corresponding bone in pab.
I have checked that it loaded two bones correctly,"Bip01" and "Bip_Weapon_R".

The paa file is under folder /character/motion/1_pc/7_pvw/weapon/45_spear/. And only 24 bones have animation. So I think you should find the skeleton of this weapon  "45_spear" to load animation properly.

Or, if you find any file which contain the following hex, it should be the spear's skeleton.
"C9 80 CF EC"
