Beyond doubt they all (atleast all I investigated) contains VAG ADPCM data. im not sure thats the information you where looking for, but they
are all audiofiles, except they lack a proper VAG Header. recreating this header made all samples playable.

Edit: and yes, some files contains text aswell, as stated. not that any of this info helps you on the structure, but could be fun to know there is audio in there!

Thanks anyway.
