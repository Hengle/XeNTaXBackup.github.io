I took a look at the format and wrote this script - NAMES MISSING. Any suggestions?

```
get NAMEPOS long
math NAMEPOS += 0x14
goto 0x38
get FILES long

for i = 1 <= FILES
	get NAME_HASH long
	get OFFSET long
	get SIZE long
	get NAME basename
        string NAME += "_"
        string NAME += i
	log NAME OFFSET SIZE
next i
```

Nevermind, found out that Xpert from Gnie has a plugin.
However, if anyone's interested in the audio material, this script extracts those nameless *.rsd files into a file structure. Can be helpful when sorting out sfx from the music.

```
get NAME string
get SIZE asize
math SIZE -= 0x800
log NAME 0x800 SIZE
```

Code: Select allgoto 0x1a

math SIZE -= 0x800
log NAME 0x800 SIZE

What is this script for, and how do I use it?

OK, Thanks! I tested out one RSD file with the script and got a WAV. Only problem is getting it to play. Any suggestions?

I can't get the extracted .wav file to play either. Anyone know how to get it to play? I've tried to convert it to .aa3 and still nothing 

EDIT: It seems I can open and play the .wav file in Audacity. But is there an easier way?

Hi, I am trying to translate the gamecube version of the game. There are tools on the internet that allow me to extract the files inside the .rcf archive, but I can't replace them. I tried the script atg_core_cement.bms but it is not compatible. Rcf explorer allows me to extract the contents, but I cannot edit or replace.

Hey man, any luck working with that RCF. file? I am trying to translate a game too, ps2 in my case, but it's a real pain in the ass to repack the contents back into a RCF. archive...
