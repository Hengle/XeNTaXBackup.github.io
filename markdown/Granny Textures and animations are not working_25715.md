- Post Title: Granny: Textures and animations are not working

Hi, I recently became interested in Grandma and was looking for python tutorials on how to extract DAT files and I was able, these files are from an old horse game. While unpacking the files, I noticed that one of the files I can't unpack is the avatar character, which is important because as you can see in this png, the horse animations are character dependent like Gallop and others. There is something wrong with this file and I tried to unpack it like the others. Regarding PC and OGG files, I want someone who can change the extensions to help me convert them: PC to BMP and OGG to MP3, the griffin model opens normally, there are textures after unpacking granny.rar. The horse's textures are not on the model and also with animations, what can I do to open the models with textures? Someone write what to do, thank you in advance.

Send the unpacked files to my e-mail: [karolinesongcry@gmail.com](mailto:karolinesongcry@gmail.com)
