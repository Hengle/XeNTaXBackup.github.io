Apparently these are based off the .XMA format, but could anyone take a look please? I'd like to know as I am gathering up some characters' voice samples to use on a soundboard and/or voice synthesis app.

Here's some archives containing Snow White's voice lines from the game:

The files with actual audio data have the suffix '_s' at the end before the file extension.
Rename the file extension from .aux to .wem and use vgmstream to transcode them into PCM WAV for easy listening / playback
