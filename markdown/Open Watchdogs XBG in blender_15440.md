- Post Title: Open Watchdogs XBG in blender?

This is the only reason I joined this forum to be honest, But  I'm a cosplayer by hobby more than tech based, so extracting models my self confuses me big time! (I am forum new to so I hope i posted in right place or someone can move this?? I clicked on bit that said 3d models..)

But you see I was recently handed a bunch of Watchdogs files by a friend because I was planning a Defalt costume and needed a model referance I can turn around for stuff like the logo on his hoodie and the mask, but i cant get the xbg files to open in blender at all. The only reason I ended up with XBG to start with was becase I was unable to find a converted Defalt for xps or xna or blender anywhere on the web that I looked (Although there are hundreds of Aiden models).

 I'd appriciate any help anyone has to offer with either helping me get Defalt into blender so I can work with it or if any one knows where I can get a model that is already converted and set up to work for XPS or Blender right off that'd be great to. I'm not so good with english words either so I  hope this all made sense. x
