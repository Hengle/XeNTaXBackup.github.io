- Post Title: CyberConnect2 XFBIN Blender Script

I made some tools for the XFBIN format and thought I'd post them here in case someone who's interested doesn't actively follow the Naruto Storm modding community.

These tools should work for all CyberConnect2 games, including .hack//G.U., JoJo All Star Battle, JoJo Eyes of Heaven, and Naruto Ultimate Ninja Storm series.

Blender Import/Export script for XFBIN models:

Python module (and script) for parsing/extracting XFBIN files:

010 Editor binary template (xfbin.bt):
