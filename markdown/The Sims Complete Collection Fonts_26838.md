- Post Title: The Sims Complete Collection Fonts

Hi!
I became interested in translating The Sims Complete Collection into Ukrainian for myself.
The game recognizes Cyrillic characters, which are in both Ukrainian and Russian, but in Ukrainian there are several characters that are absent in other languages and they are not displayed. But I'm too stupid to understand what to do so that the game understands Ukrainian.
And the UIGraphics archive contains a Fonts folder with FON and ffn files. Do I understand correctly that I need to create a FON font file and add it to the archive, as well as a set of ffn fonts with Ukrainian?
Perhaps there is someone who would explain in a few steps what concretely needs to be done and in what way.
Saw a similar thread a few years ago but couldn't find an answer.

Please upload "Fonts" folder to some hosting site like mega.nz, google drive etc. and then share a public link with us, 
so we can check out those files.

Well, it seems it is a standard EA font format with FNTF signature [http://wiki.xentax.com/index.php/EA_FFN_Font](http://wiki.xentax.com/index.php/EA_FFN_Font)
There is a paint.net plugin for editing those files, available for download in this topic [viewtopic.php?f=33&t=22120](https://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=33&t=22120)
So you can try to use it.
