Hi,

Offzip can extract some files from the archives but i don't have the filenames...

gamedata.pak contains some lua scripts files
textures.pak contains some dds textures files (with dragonunpaker)

Jader naub can you add the functionnality into your tool to build back an compressed zlib archive with you file injector 
because your tool can greatly extract/detect directly the files like dds,wav,ogg from the zlib pak archives but not directly lua,xml,txt script need to extract the archive with zlibc.exe. I need to rebuild the gamedata.pak with my lua script modification but i can't with you file injector. 

can you try too look on gamedata.pak please

the script should be ok for reimporting through quickbms so read section 3 of quickbms.txt and try it:

I am sorry, for grave digging, but found this thread, after searching for a way to open the PS3 Armageddon Rider pak files.
I already tried to use QuickBMS, but it seems, that the PS3 files of Armageddon Riders have another encryption.
Can I provide you with the files and you could look after it or are there any other ways I could help?
