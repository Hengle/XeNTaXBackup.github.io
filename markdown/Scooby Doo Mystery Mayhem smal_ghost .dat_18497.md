- Post Title: Scooby Doo Mystery Mayhem smal_ghost *.dat

Hi i tried to import a 00000046.dat called smal_ghost in scooby doo mystery mayhem in 3ds max. but the thing is there too much vertixes going on the X, Y and Z axis. there some vertices and faces if you type in smal_ghost. it doesn't have it's fileid, it has it's bonesnum and vertices but i can't think what are other structure to ConvertToMesh. can someone help me i just want to see what it looks like.
