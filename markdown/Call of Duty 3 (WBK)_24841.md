Hello there, i been trying to rip the soundtrack of Call of Duty 3 (2006) for years and recently i have no idea how to rip these wbk files from the game. 

I am basing these of the 360 files overall, the format i think in theory is similar to the files from the Spider Man games that were made by Treyarch. 

I wonder if anyone knows how to rip these files? 

I know there is a soundtrack CD that was released back in the day but it don't have all of the music from the game and it borrows mostly cues from the cutscenes instead of the music we hear ingame.

Nevermind, i actually find a way to rip the soundtrack via vgmstream overall either in winamp or foobar.

I will be pretty much closing this thread.
