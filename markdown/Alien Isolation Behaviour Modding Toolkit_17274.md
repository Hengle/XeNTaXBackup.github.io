- Post Title: Alien Isolation Behaviour Modding Toolkit

I've just released a new mod tool to allow for full modification of all AI behaviours in Alien: Isolation. 
This is a pretty big project and allows for not only customisation of a lot of game features and mechanics, but also gives a view into how the game is scripted to deal with situations.

This mod tool works through Brainiac Designer, a flowchart-based behaviour tree creation tool. Using Brainiac means it's super easy to view and modify the game's behaviours.

Give it a go and see what you think! Full installation and setup instructions can be found in the README file.

EDIT (2020): The tool has been expanded considerably since this post - now covering a bunch of extra functionality. Check out the GitHub page to see its full functionality.
