- Post Title: How to export a *.MDL file?

Hi folks
I'd like to know if there is any software or plugin (3dsmax etc) that can open and export the .MDL file. It's from Half Life, I tried a tool called HL MDL Viewer, but it does not have a Export option...

that has little to do with file research, this forum is about dissecting files.. not teaching people how to open a file in said program, or how to get said model for a certain game....

pet peeves out of the way, the MDL format is indeed from HL1, and is fully supported by valve. you can get the valve SDK and use that to create new MDL's. valve uses a text based format called SMD for both HL1 and HL2, which they use to create a MDL. there are no plugins for 3dsmax, that deal with the HL1 MDL.

that being said I would recommend you google for a HalfLife specific community to ask these questions. Unless you want to just rip models from MDL, then use a decompiler to convert the MDL back into SMD files.. a widely used method, is the decompiler that is built into MilkShape3D. Otherwise if you are trying to get models back into HL.. your seriously in the wrong place.

Yes, I just want extract those .mdl files, put the models in any 3D software. I've used google to try to find a tool that can do that, but I didn't find anything. 
But thanks for the advice, I'll get help in any HL forum.
