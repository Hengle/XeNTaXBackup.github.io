Quick and dirty Bloodlines Tools 3.9a
(Vampire: The Masquerade â€“ Bloodlines)

Current features are :
* VPK data extraction (001-009 and 101+103 contain data)
* Texture conversion :
  * TTZ->VTF, TTZ->TGA
  * VTF->TTZ, VTF->TGA
  * DDS->VTF, DDS->TTZ
  Conversion to TGA currently supports these pixel formats :
  * DXT1 (no alpha)
  * DXT3 with explicit alpha
  * DXT5
  * RGBA8888 and BGRA8888
  * BGR888
* Texture header modification
* Rudimentary (=useless at the moment) model information
* Model texture path and texture name changing!
  (Ugly hack, don't overuse)
* Map entity editor! (Extremely rudimentary, no interface)
* Savegame unpacker (nothing useful as of yet)
* Savegame trimmer (warning, *only* use for mod creation testing)
