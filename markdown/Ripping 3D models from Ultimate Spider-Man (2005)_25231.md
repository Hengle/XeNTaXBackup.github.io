- Post Title: Ripping 3D models from Ultimate Spider-Man (2005)

[https://mega.nz/file/NK5iAAbD#4y-rNKosy ... 99D2LxQpho](https://mega.nz/file/NK5iAAbD#4y-rNKosy1Av1VHUg7tagmrE9pktHfXux99D2LxQpho)

I tried the character model from Ultimate Spider-Man with hex2obj, but I can't find proper faces:

Does anyone know how to find them properly?
The folders are:
2 = bone data
6 = textures
21 = meshes
