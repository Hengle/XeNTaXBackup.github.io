- Post Title: Mercenaries 2: World in Flames (PC) music.pws+*music*.block

What we have here is a bank, music.pws, which is probably a huge concatenated audio file (hopefully using just 1 or 2 codecs) without a header or recognizable split points & a few associated *.block files (extracted with [this](http://aluigi.org/bms/mercs2.bms) from vz.wad bigfile) which might contain a TOC or another info required to split that bank. Is it even possible? I certainly hope so!

[There's already a method](https://zenhax.com/viewtopic.php?p=21817#p21817) but it doesn't always output working tracks (plus it seems to only extract 85% or 90% of music.pws contents).
Also it might not be much but [author of script I used provides some details about those *.block](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?p=35437#p35437), it should be worth checking out too.

[This is a cut from music.pws](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1ZFfaoKSjnfMRldd_fmWMQloDRicLAaC_) & [this are all blocks that might be of use](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1qcH8JJXpFebRjOkNztHh_dNsrLg-fQdi). Good luck with this!
Goodbye!
