- Post Title: Max Payne 3 PC .AWC file ADPCM Decode.

So the PC version is out and i grabbed this AWC file out of the DLC which did not use RPF file and the music/sounds were unpacked already. The codec is ADPCM and of course uses the same interleaved blocking system as other consoles. But the table might not be encrypted. I cannot tell

Please post here if you want to be pm'ed the file.
