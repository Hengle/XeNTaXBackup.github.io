Couldn't find face indices in your uploaded mrg file nor a decent point cloud.
Also the last 69% of the file are filled with zeroes.
Guess this is not a model file.

when I try aluigi's script I get this error:

```
--------------------------------------

- signature of 4 bytes at offset 0x00000000 doesn't match the one
  expected by the script:

  this one: ""
  00 ff ff ff                                       ....

  expected: "MRGâ†’"
  4d 52 47 1a                                       MRG.

- 0 files found in 0 seconds
  coverage file 0     0%   4          484951824

Press RETURN to quit
```


There are 7276 occurences of 4d 52 47 1a in the bin file
but I don't have the time to fiddle around with this.
(I will try it with the first section cut off 'til the first pattern occurence)

well, told me again: "0 files found"

edit: ok, had to cut off the first two sections:


```
--------------------------------------
  0000f000 26832      00000000.dat
  00016000 34848      00000001.dat
  0001f000 7156       00000002.dat
  00021000 14296      00000003.dat
  ...
  00422000 6976       000000fd.dat
  00424000 27856      000000fe.dat
  396e0800 3108859441 000000ff.dat

Error: incomplete input file number 0, can't read 64 bytes.
```


But it's only .dat files and it's very tedious to proceed in that way, so:
how did you extract that bin?

hmm, I'm using qickbms 0.6, strange
Is this the bms script you're using?

```
# script for QuickBMS http://aluigi.org/papers.htm#quickbms

idstring "MRG\x1a"
get FILES long
for i = 0 < FILES
    get OFFSET long
    get SIZE long
    math OFFSET *= 0x800
    log "" OFFSET SIZE
next i
```


You don't need to upload all 7611 files  (which seem to be of type .dat only?)
I've got some .dats as you can see from my previous post, would need the biggest one only.

Also 3 to 5 of each other type would be nice, varying in sizes

well, on a review of these files I sadly found near to nothing:

mrgs might contain textures:

For .dats and .mcq the result was the same as before:

How do you recognize a "point cloud"? Maybe I can help here... Not to find the format, but in finding a useful file.

The endian is little endian for PC and PS files, big endian for console games (for XBOX for example).

Face indices start and count are not required
but you need to know where the vertices reside in the file
and whether they are floats, half floats or (signed) shorts.

For floats it's rather simple because they have characteristic patterns (containing 3E,3F..45, 80)
but for half floats and shorts it's more difficult.

You just have to try out different formats and start addresses.
As vertex count a value of 100 or 500 makes sense.
Then press the 'mesh' button in hex2obj with PtCld button active.

If 'vertex block mode' is used instead of "sequential" it's even harder because you've got another paramter to vary.

good luck.
