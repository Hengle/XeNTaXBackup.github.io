What it says up there ^

I'm wondering if it is the same as TRS2004, seeing as its a game(ish) from 2003.
And it doesn't open with the Train Driver 2005 plugin.

That's doubtful, It's 194mb   

You could download the Demo and try.

Actually, I can't tell you if it's the same as a TRS2004 .ja file because I don't have any TRS2004 files.  I can tell you that it's different than the original Jet 1.1 .ja files and different than the Ultimate Trainz .ja files that I have.  

The 'version' number on it is x'0201', as opposed to x'0101' for Jet and x'01f1' for Ultimate Trainz.  The layout of the files is, other than that, virtually identical to the layout of the Jet 1.1 .ja files, in terms of where the input and output sizes and displacements and stuff. 

But it's either encrypted or uses a different compression format, because I can't extract any of the data at all.
