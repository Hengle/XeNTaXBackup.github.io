Bro, dont think people are not interezted in your project, let me explain you something, made unpack tools can take time, but made repack tools take more time really, and if i tell time i talk abouth months.
If u have something info, like the game file format, or link for files you are interezted in edit, post here, this can be a good beginin.

It's already been shown how to do it in another thread here, and in fact, he has been in that thread too, but he wants to be given a fish, instead of fishing ...

This is why I won't make special hacking programs for people, even for money, as all it will end up being, is a bunch of headaches, and I'm sure the smarter programmers here won't fall into this trap either ...
