I downloaded Shutokou Battle Xtreme, and try to rip from this game. But, extracting obb files is too risky because of rooting requirement.
What can I do?

You can install it to emulator, like [MEmu](http://www.memuplay.com/).
And how you get this game, it's out already?

Thanks 
I found it, making an Apple ID in Japanese it's not a trivial task, but i done it too 
For Android version i just googled for apk.
It's better to use version for hardware (or emu) you have, because all useful files located in downloaded cache, which is created after you launch game.

> I got apk file and I will test. I hope is unity game
Yeah, it's Unity 5+, so you'll need to use Unity Asset Bundle Extractor for unpacking and checking content of .cache files (also for converting textures to .png), then export from UABE to .assets file, if you found car model or track/garage scene bundle, and open it in Unity Studio v0.5.1b3 for model export.
Works for me:

Detail is low, about 15K-25K faces for one car model.

Yes, it works, the game has more than 20 Japanese cars.

The question is how to extract using Unity Asset Bundle Extractor cache all files at once, look for them or any part of it is very difficult there cache files are too many?

Just solved it 
You need to make batch.txt file with "+DIR <full path to cache folder>" line inside. Important part here is encoding of this text file, it MUST be "UTF-8 without BOM" in therms of Notepad++.
Then put this file to UABE exe folder and run this command:
AssetBundleExtractor.exe batchexport batch.txt

I attached my files, just put them to exe folder, edit path in .txt file and run .bat file.

Did you edit path in txt file and point it to your folder with .cache files?
And if you open single .cache file with UABE - it works?

Thank you very much, it's running ))

for Genki
I am more than confident that the guys from Genki browsing this forum, and they are not particularly pleased event, please do not do as did Namco, do not close the download cache, your games as a masterpiece, for the most part, we only look at your models and at best make convert, it is difficult to imagine that someone would use them for commercial purposes ...
Reversing is only a matter of time and the popularity of the product, all games can be opened.


And more Drift Spirits from Namco easily give models if desired car is available in the garage, it is also stored in the Unity cache files.
Guys who have any ideas how to open all the cars to get them cache Drift Spirits?

Maybe typo in path or encoding of txt is changed?

The method is 100% working, I checked personally. Upgrade 3ds max to the latest version and download the latest versions of UABE and unity studio.

Hello, I used this batch method and successfully opened the file in batch. However, when exporting PNG images, you will be prompted [unable to open the streamed data file! Unable to convert the texture data!]
