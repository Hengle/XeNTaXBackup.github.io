I am from germany, its propably also the reason for the bad english iam using sometimes 

My favorite programming languages are Python and C.
I really enjoy reversing custom protocols, used by different programms or games.
Because i needed to know the decryption of some protocols, i tried learning assembler, with more or less good success.
Besides game protocols, i am intressed in custom file formats etc.

Cheers Evilpie

i just take this introduction from my fellow german evilpie,
2 say also hi to the Xentax family!

i'm not sooo into this programming stuff...
i'm more like a "oldschool" CAW creator for SD games
i do this since 2002 or earlier i'll guess. yea probably since SD Know Your Role! but the first Wrestling Games(dosent matter if it was from Acclaim,Aki,Yukes,THQ ect.) didnt had so much u could create with....so therefore i always say 2002 was my coming out lol

i was also a CAWS.ws member but there is some much kindergarten/selfish BS going on, so i joined the CAWSpiracy last year and also wanna try my luck here now.

before i end my post i wanna give a biiiiig shoutout to Mr. MOuse & Brienj!!!
what u guys did so far is incredible!

every day when i jump on my PT explorer i go crazy & smile my ass off haha
same counts for the Holly HACK Tut from Brienj esp. with his script!

i hope i will also find now here a script 2 get from UFC 2009 the texures!
