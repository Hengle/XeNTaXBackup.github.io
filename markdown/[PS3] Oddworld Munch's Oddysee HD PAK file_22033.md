Hello,

This is the only archive present in the games files and it is not a PSARC. 

The format seems fairly basic, there is no whole-archive compression (unless compression is optional per file) and it seems to be similar to TAR in that it is just primarily files strung together back-to-back. There appears to be a TOC at the very end of the file.

It begins immediately with the flag and magic number for a PNG.

I don't have any time to dedicate to this at the moment so I figured I'd give someone else a shot if it happens to be a simple structure that's similar to something they've dealt with. I may eventually dig into it later.
