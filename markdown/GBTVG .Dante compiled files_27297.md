Hi everyone i need help de-compiling .dante file format that is used in GB TVG and Remaster 

This format is a moddified c# format that was used by Infernal Engine and Terminal Reality called Dante scripting

Here is a dante file and the un-compiled dante file of the same level:

Abyss.script
AbyssART.script
AbyssSection1.script
