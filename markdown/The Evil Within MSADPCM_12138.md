Was wondering if anyone can generate a MSadpcm script to add a header for these files?

Thanks.

Is it really possible to decompress a MS ADPCM file like that? I mean IMA ADPCM files are pretty simple but I've never dig through MS ADPCM files so I'm pretty confused. Did you find a way to convert those files one by one previously?

I don't have this game so I can't verify this, but the header information should be stored somewhere else in my opinion.
Also I couldn't get these files to play as any kind of ADPCM supported by FFmpeg.

Okay. Back to Xbox360 version for me then. I suggest you guys do the same 'cause you can have filenames as PC version (thanks to Aluigi) and .xma files are not lossy after conversion. 
Plus, no weird compression in the .xma files of the console version. I tested it with regular tools (xma_parse11 + ToWav) and it worked like a charm (+5Gb of music and sound w/o the voice lines).
