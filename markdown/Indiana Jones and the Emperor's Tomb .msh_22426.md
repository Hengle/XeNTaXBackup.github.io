- Post Title: Indiana Jones and the Emperor's Tomb .msh

Hello everyone. I have a mild obsession with this old Indy Jones game. I've been playing it for 3 years as a speedrunner. I also frequent VRChat and like to create and upload worlds for people to explore. Many worlds on there are rips from various games with lots of cool custom scripts. So I thought I'd try and compile the maps from my favorite Indy Jones game into a map on VRC for people to explore.

It uses the Slayer engine. The models have 3 parts, .ban, .gin, .msh. I'm not sure what 2 of the files are for, but the main one is .msh.

I asked someone for help and sent them Indiana Jones' .msh file. 
They made two .h2o files for me, which I used to create obj files using hex2obj.
I have no idea how to create these h2o files myself. The faces also seem to have some kind of issue that might take a long time to solve.


I humbly ask for any help with creating a Noesis script using the .h2o files I was given.
That way I could use it for every mesh in the game.
I appreciate every bit of help I get. I've been trying to do this on my own but couldn't.

In the zip file I put the 2 h2o files, the 2 obj files, and the .msh, .ban, .gin.
I'm sure only the .msh and h2o files are useful though.

Hey there,

[viewtopic.php?t=21138](https://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?t=21138)
Im afraid that mark eckos getting up uses an updated version of the slayer .msh though.

Ye it seems to be extremely similar... Do you think you could help me figure out how to do something like that for this game? I'm very noobish

Never have I seen so much progress in IJET Modding for a long while, I'm extremely excited to see the final result. Animation modding would be nice to see one day.
