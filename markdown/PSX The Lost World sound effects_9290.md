Tried scanning the psx game with psound, but it only finds 60 files and no dino roars. I wonder why is that.

Could be in a non standard format or compressed file, if you want dino roars, JP: Trespasser has a great set of sounds. High quality for a 1999 game too, it's a shame the game itself was aiming for such high goals, it's probably why it's a buggy mess. if you can find a copy, use a app called tpa reader.
