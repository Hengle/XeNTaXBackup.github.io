- Post Title: 《Blade & Sword II》MMO MAXScripts need help （.paf .pmf  ）？

This is a very Oriental Fantasy martial arts game
Costumes in the game is very special
The movement of the model is very typical of Chinese Kungfu.
Very strong sense of attack
I use BMS to unpack these resources (quickbms0.7.5 version)
[http://aluigi.org/bms/blade_sword_2.bms](http://aluigi.org/bms/blade_sword_2.bms)
But don't know how the model and the action of these files open
Hope to be able to get help
Game download：[http://d2.qq.com/down.shtml](http://d2.qq.com/down.shtml)


I have been helped, the post ends

Hey, my friend, this is really cool.
I'm not sure what format is the action file for the game
I think it should be.Prf
There is no MAXScripts to open these models and action files
