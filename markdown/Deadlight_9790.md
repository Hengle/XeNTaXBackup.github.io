What do you mean by "export maps?" The game is umodel compatible so you can extract pretty much anything you need already.

Checkout the below link, you can extract the mesh etc...
[http://www.gildor.org/en/projects/umodel#files](http://www.gildor.org/en/projects/umodel#files)

But if you want the scene as it as to 3ds max, then use "3D DX Ripper". 

Good luck...

There is a GUI version of umodel is available, search for it. (umodelGUI).

Things will be easier with this one.
