Is that a false positive?
When I unpacked the rar archive, Avira Antivir told me that "W32/Induc.A" was found inside.

It is NOT false positive, the exe file in archive is really infected by Induc, anybody who tried it and has delphi istalled is now infected. If somebody wants this tool, delete original exe file and recompile it by yourself.

I scanned the file with a number of virus scanner tools (AVG, Antivir, bitdefender, Kapersky, NOD32, Panda and Sophos). ALL report it to be infected with the Win32.Induc Virus   .
As I'm very interested in the tool (it seems to support .xwb files with file format version 42), but don't have Delphi: could someone recompile it (without an attached virus  ) and reupload it, please? 
A question to Crypton: does the tool only extract PCM data from the .xwb files or other data types (especially WMA), too?
