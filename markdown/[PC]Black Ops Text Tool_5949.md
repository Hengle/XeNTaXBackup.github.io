- Post Title: [PC]Black Ops Text Tool

Good day,

this tiny tool will help you in the process of translating Call of Duty: Black ops for PC into some other language or simply fooling around with the texts. I saw some people asking about that, so here is a solution. It can extract&inject all textual elements, such as objectives, dialogue subtitles, it should work with any language. If your language has some special characters, you'll have to find their ASCII codes and, if they aren't included in the font file, edit the font image to support your chars.
It works with .ff files located in your \zone\lang dir, where 'lang' represents your game's language.
Make backups of all .ff files if you're planning on injecting texts in there!

Cool  But I've heard that almost all CoD translations respect string size, does it apply to the strings extracted from this tool?

Thanks. No, you don't have to respect the original string size - your strings can be both shorter and longer than the originals and everything will be functional in-game.
All extracted strings, of course, will be identical to the ones in-game, then you can edit them as much as you like.

^Sorry, but I doubt PS3 has the same .ff format. You can still try it yourself if you own the PS3 version, though.
Make backups!

Hello, sorry my bad English. I am wanting to translate the game, but I'm having a problem with the tool, so I could see, they should have the same size as the original. Thus it is impossible to a translation of the texts, would solve this problem of tool? Thanks.

Well, of course it works. But you need to be very carefull when you translate the text.
You should test the every chapter one by one. Sometimes, a little mistake can make you give up.
