- Post Title: Nitroplus Blasterz (PC) - file with no extension

Hello everyone. I have the game Nitroplus Blasterz (Steam Version) and all of it's data files have no extension. I read a past post about Examu formats on zenhax for the ps3 version, but the .bms script returns error on these extension-less files. Can someone help with identifying the format of the data files? I'd really appreciate it. Here's one of the files linked below:

Your sample is an XWB Audio file [http://wiki.xentax.com/index.php/XACT_XWB_XSB_XGS_Audio](http://wiki.xentax.com/index.php/XACT_XWB_XSB_XGS_Audio)

Rename your file to "file1.xwb" and then
you can use unxwb [http://aluigi.altervista.org/papers/unxwb.zip](http://aluigi.altervista.org/papers/unxwb.zip)
to extract WAV files from XWB.

Then you will be able to play all your WAV files in some audio player, e.g. Winamp.

Thank you so much. Sorry it took me forever to get a reply to you. It's been hectic trying to use the pc lately for longer than 5 minutes...
