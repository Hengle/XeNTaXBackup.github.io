You try to check files larger than 10Mb. Cannot play files over 10 mb, it looks like the code is not correct with files over 10 mb

Sorry, after extracting I found the files are in .dat format. I use the BMS command to extract the file. wdf. There are no files in Obj format. I use your script that cannot open some files. dat this [https://mega.nz/#F!D7QlEaAT!bwcNrhBEQ8GJGxUvFsj3ww](https://mega.nz/#F!D7QlEaAT!bwcNrhBEQ8GJGxUvFsj3ww)

i download a Fresh Client Right now to test but… the script dosent work with all .dat files because not all .dat files are meshes … but i will check if they changed something

if the script gives a "Error occurred in anonymous codeblock; filename: D:\backup\justiceonline.ms; position: 13242; line: 360
-- Unknown property: "parent" in undefined" error just disable the bonepart at

for h=1 to parentid.count do
(
	if (parentid[h] != -1) then	((getnodebyname (Bonenametest2[h])).parent = getnodebyname(Bonenametest[h]) )
	--if (parentid[h] != -1) then 	(append barr (BNArr2[(parentid[h]+1)].name))
	--if (parentid[h] != -1) then	(append bnarrrnamex (getnodebyname (bnarr2[h]).name ))
	--if (parentid[h] != -1) then	((getnodebyname (bnarr2[h].name)).parent =getnodebyname(Bonenametest[h]))
)

ist basicly the script i posted before the only difference is that i disabled the bonepart

in this script at LODs-files with characters it doesnt use bones and weight….
Scene files have no bones so that doesnt matter there

Why does this scenario when the model is exported without materials like the ones you wrote? I have a script you write for the Black Desert that can produce materials

@usebdt i didnt try that Script but im Sure that bd Script has a link to the textures as there is no way it creates itself custom textures.. And also in the descrioption He Talks about the mesh and uv.. Uv is not the texture... Uv is in percentage where in a texture a vertex is located... Given that the mesh knows where parts of the texture is used onto the mesh

here a beta Maxscript for characters.

Thank you so much for this! 

I found a model where it errors and only partially loads the meshes, or it fails completely and loads nothing (seems to be random, it works partially or then you try again and doesn't work at all)

It also gives this error


If it partially loads it seems to be missing a hair mesh, inner body mesh, and also part of the skirt for this clothing set

Here is a download link to the .dat that is erroring your script and not fully working if you want to check it out to see why it isn't loading everything. [http://www.mediafire.com/file/4yagknk7z ... e.rar/file](http://www.mediafire.com/file/4yagknk7z9sk820/625c914e.rar/file)

Thank you in advance for any help, and thank you again for sharing the script!

Can you share the model when completing the material assignment ??

Not really, because the bms script seems to not extract the materials properly, they are all corrupted so all I was doing was getting the models only. The texture .dds are broken so it isn't possible right now.

they are not broken just in a dx Format that seems just a few programs know… on the one Hand Noesis knows all beside normalmaps … and for normal Maps if you Import them into Maya you can resafe them to something else

I have Noesis, but the .dds textures load as blank white with it. I tried exporting and it is still just a blank white image file. I'm not sure if I need a specific plugin or not, but it isn't working for me D:

im not sure why your Noesis cant open the dds files. i dont think i have installed a Plugin..i just using the lastest Noesis Version.

what i can tell is that the quickbms script works flawless on the dds files all dds files are how they are made they are not corrupt in any way.

Who can help update the QMS script to solve the latest WDF? Thank you very much! The current one doesn't seem to be working properly.

Just put this out there for anyone who cared...
You can ripped this game model using Ninja Ripper 64-bit (Intruder Inject)...

The path in Ninja Ripper 

```
...\逆水寒（NGP游戏平台）\out\Release\LootHoarder.exe
```


There's an issue of the clothes not in T-pose/A-Pose...
To avoid that problem, you might wanna rip it from the Movie Editor mode... then choose the A-pose pose from custom motion which located in your game sub-directory.

```
...逆水寒\artist\res\ResourceForPlayer\fbx
```


Note that you might have to open the max file in the fbx folder then export it out as FBX file before you can import it into the Video Editor.



And if you managed to get any result from that then congratz.... if not then just Google translate their Movie Editor document page here

Or watch these (even if you can't understand Mandarin... a picture worth a thousand words, right? Well, since it's a video, I guess it worth billions)

Hi! Taking the time to bump this.

After looking around and testing all the scripts available here (both Blender and 3DS) I'm yet to open a single DAT file.
Also tried to open the Movie editor to rip with Ninja Ripper but I'm stuck with an error on repeat (prompt name's MapEditor, error is unreadable) (as in placeholders for Chinese even though my locale is in Chinese)
And finally also tried Noesis but it just cannot read it at all.

Would someone we able to do a script for DAT to OBJ or possibly do a script that would work for blender 3.3+?

Also gonna bump it!

I'm coming up with the same issues as Willomillo. 

I've tried everything in the thread along with the Video Editor attempt. It just freezes at around 70% and then never loads. 

Any possibility on a script being made for the .dat to OBJ? 

Here are some more .dat samples

the QBM script still can extract latest version, but it useless, you can still get dds texture, but the texture look weird and unusually small, other are all dat file, which i search all the internal included chinese web, test all plugins, none is able to extract it, hope someone succeed can share how to do it
