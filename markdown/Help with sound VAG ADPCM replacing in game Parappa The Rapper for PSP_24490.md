Hello, guys. I faced with a problem. I trying to replace a VAG ADPCM sounds in game Parappa The Rapper on PSP. The problem is need to replace this sounds for HQ 44,100 hz sounds instead of LQ 22,050hz sounds. I discovered that in Parappa CMP.IMG archive and i found some files. 
I discovered some of this files with extension PHD, and with extension PBD. I found that PHD is like a headers from all VAG files, but in special format. Screenshots of PHD file. 
 

In PBD file i found just a normal VAG sounds. Screenshot

I need to replace this sounds to 44,100 hz HQ sounds. But i don't know how can i do it.
