I'm new to extracting files from games and was wondering if anyone could help. 

I'm looking for 3D model for Jessies Mini Bike from Final Fantasy VII remake on the PS4.  I found a  few resources online but most of them need a bit more knowledge then I have right now lol

I have the PS4 game and the FFVII app to extract .uasset files, although I'm not sure how to get far enough to use it 

I'm not sure if anyone has a link to any tutorials or even better the model of the bike as I've found a few character models online but no vehicles yet.

Thanks in advance
