Hey all, Atrusino here. I would like to thank you all for havin me and I apologize I wasn't able to be as active as I wanted to. I'm havin trouble running my own forum now and I've got a major researc project ahead of me. It pains me to leave without having done anything to help, but perhaps a few months down the road I can come back and try again. Who knows, by then I may have a breakthrough in AI 

I just wanna wish everyone at Xentax good luck in the following months and I hope to join you all again some day.

Luck and best wishes,
-Atrusino
