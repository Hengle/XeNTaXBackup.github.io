Looks very promising ! 
Do you think it could also apply to Unreal Engine 3 games ?

Any way you could have it export the entire map as .fbx/.blend/gltf? Txt file is useful for a few things, mainly matching lights, but porting cross-engine would be 5000x easier that way.  Fbx/.blend especially because they store light data and can be imported into unity easily.   If not, would the umodel author be interested in implementing your code?

Also, will you be releasing any of this for the rest of us to try?

Agreed, i'd be very interested in this too.
