There are always many people working on savegame editors. Do you think we should open a Savegames analyses subforum for this type of game file?

Yeah that could be fun 
is there any generic save game tools to help edit save games for people who are not good at it?
most save games once decrypted are very basic and easy to edit.

My opinion:
I vote for Yes as Im interested in it sometimes bit a little, anyway it would be more good to improve the working on game research to solve the games like in my sign.

I just noticed this poll today, but I vote yes.  Save games can be very powerful to change certain games.  I did a lot of things on the Xbox modifying just the game saves.  The Hitman series is a great example of it.

Indeed, and let's not forget the Legend of Zelda savegame exploit that opened up the Homebrew world for the Nintendo Wii.
