- Post Title: The Room Two by Fireproof Games

I'm trying to extract some textures from the Android version of The Room Two by Fireproof Games. I figure, "It's a Unity game on Android, so it shouldn't be so hard."

My goal is to get at the tarot cards from the last level. I used UnityAssetsExplorer-1.2 to find a file called "Tarot_Cards_01_RGB.tex" inside "sharedassets5.assets" which can also be extracted as, "Tarot_Cards_01_RGB.tex.dds" I then tried DDS Converter 2-8698 and the GIMP DDS plugin to try to import these and get to png. Both fail, not recognizing the format.

it's a 682 kb binary file and nothing really jumps out, although I'm not familiar with the format Unity uses. Any suggestions?

Ooh, that's neat. But why's it all yellow? Is there any way to get the proper colors?

maybe a palette problem, or the choosen format is wrong.
Dunno - I'm just providing hints to help people help themselves
