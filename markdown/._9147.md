I looked at your file a while back sorry i never replied, it looks like 2 files in one container sort of thing. I'm not sure how to decompress the L7ZZ package but this is a start leaving you with the raw container.

I tried to use quickbms to decompress it using standard L7ZZ but it didn't work if the window values were changed i'm afraid there might not be a possibility of decompressing it with Quickbms unless it's updated somehow. You can see the references to height and width, for example 00 05 00 00 & 02 D0 00 00 aka 1280x720.

Maybe someone else can take it from here but,

Here is the script i did:

```
# MrNightmareTM
# Version 0.1a

endian big

getdstring NAME 0x8
get OFFSET2 long
get NSIZE long
get SIZE long
get HEIGHT long
get WIDTH long
get HEIGHT long
get WIDTH long
savepos OFFSET
get BNAME basename
string BNAME += "_texture.lz77"
log BNAME OFFSET SIZE

FindLoc OFFSET2 string "Parts" 0 ""
goto OFFSET2
getdstring NAME2 0x8
get SIZE2 long
get BNAME2 basename
string BNAME2 += "_parts.prt"
log BNAME2 OFFSET2 SIZE2



```

Oh, thanks for your reply. Even if I can't extract archive files, you show me that quickbms may not extract custom Lz77 packages. Would it be the same on the Pyton or C++...?
