- Post Title: Help with IA V/T Colorful (Vita) .pk

I've never done any vita hacking before, but I got a zip of the game files from here [https://nblog.org/psvita/iavt-colorful- ... ex-ps-vita](https://nblog.org/psvita/iavt-colorful-jpnenglish-patcheddlc-maidump-v233-2zex-ps-vita)
so i could extract the menu images for an osu skin I'm making. Problem is, I have no idea how to extract pk files. 

I do personally have a vita and a legal cart of the game, if that's any help.

Could anyone help me out with this? Even a little assistance would be greatly appreciated.
