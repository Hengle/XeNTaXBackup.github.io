- Post Title: Extracting pre-rendered cutscenes from Frostbite 3 games

So, I've been using some excellent tools here to get ebx, res and chunks from Mirror's Edge Catalyst, and even extracted the audio from those. I'd love to extract the in game cutscenes (which are pre-rendered, so they should be video files of some type). The ebx files seem to be there, but I have no idea how to proceed and get the actual video files out of them. So my question is if there are tools available, or perhaps some that could work with a slight modification? Or is this a case of completely new tools which need to be written?

Thanks in advance.
