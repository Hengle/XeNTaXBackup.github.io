- Post Title: Buffy The Vampire Slayer (XBOX) pak file

Game: Buffy The Vampire Slayer, 2002 (XBOX)
Developer: The Collective
Publisher: EA
File: Pak

Hi,

I'm hoping someone in the know may be able to have some luck in unpacking the pak file for this game. Much easier said than done!

I've uploaded two of the pak files to the OneDrive link below. If anyone would be interested in taking a look it would be much appreciated.

Thanks in advance
