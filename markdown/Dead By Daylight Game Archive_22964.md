How can i reimport DBD .pak files after unpacking, what bms script is needed for this? Tried it in other ways, but the files after packing differed in size (1.9.3 Version)

Did you try this script? [http://aluigi.org/bms/unreal_tournament_4.bms](http://aluigi.org/bms/unreal_tournament_4.bms)


You can read documentation here [https://aluigi.altervista.org/papers/quickbms.txt](https://aluigi.altervista.org/papers/quickbms.txt)
Imported files can't be larger than original files.

The thing is, I don't know which script to use to package the extracted files. I tried to do everything as in the documentation, but writes that some files are missing, although they are. I used unreal_tournament to extract the files.

So maybe you should contact script creator for support.

Reimport mode should work fine in most cases, also some games can be modified using unpacked files.
