- Post Title: KH1 Alternate Model Viewer or Extra Controls

I would Like to know if there is an alternate Stand-Alone model viewer for Kh1 Mdls and Mdlx models rather than Neosis and ModelViewerWX 0.3 that has animation support, as well as features that allow for zooming, camera rotation and movement, as well as animation speed control and others?

No, just ModelViewerD3DX and Noesis, I'm afraid. You could ask yaz0r or Revelation to enhance their plugins to do so, but I don't know if they have the time or the will to do so.
