Hi, can you add support for the resource.* files of The Moment of Silence? It has a great soundtrack that I would like to extract.

A demo can be downloaded from [http://www.momentofsilence.com/](http://www.momentofsilence.com/)

Thank you

Hi,

Can you please supply us with some archives from the game to look at - we don't have the time or resources to download demos all the time 

First, download the File Cutter program from [http://www.watto.org/extract/download/cutter.zip](http://www.watto.org/extract/download/cutter.zip) and run the program. Select one of the large archives, and click the OK button - the program will copy some of the archive and zip it up. You can then attach the zip to this forum, or email it to us.

Thanks mate.

Yes, or try the windows-only version of the cutter:

Will download the demo anyhow (cable).

Hi, I've used the cutter application to generate some files on the big resource files (>300 Mb). The zip files were > 256 Kb, so used one small resource file (70 Mb)  I've attached the result here.

Thanks a lot.

Hi there!

The archives of the game are made of several ressource.00* files. There is also a ressource.map file, as it contains textstrings I think this file is the filesystem file. If you download the file, delete the zip extension (because of upload limitations)

Hi guys,

Sorry for not looking at these archives, for some reason the thread did not appear in my "unread posts" list. Anyway, I have downloaded all the attached files and will look at them soon.

Hi mate,

I am not sure why it does not work properly - maybe it is because many *.000 archives are temporary or setup archives and thus are not very reliable.

If you would like me to take a look at it, you can send an archive using the File Cutter program a few posts above.

Thanks mate.

resource.map

This file is much similar at the same file of english version, but the number of the contained file is a lot less. Moreover I have uncovered that offset and size of files does not correspond to the pack resource, probably is different the method to calculate the offset and size.

bye  

PS: The italian version have this file in more "mossfl.dll" that is not present in english version.
I have open it with WinHEX and i discoverd this call funcion:
SetFilePointer and GetFileSize, probably this library calculate the offset pointer and size for resource pack file.

Thank you
Dragon Unpacker can extract the files, like cutscenes and sounds from this particular game. But why? If you want the music, just ask me  I have the original soundtrack release in lossless format, plus all the cutscene music by Nugel Bros. Music plus some cues extracted from the game. The only cue I am really missing after all those years is the prologue cue by Dynamedion.
