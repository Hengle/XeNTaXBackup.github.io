Got some more stuff out.

texture name is the same as the filename. Only one mesh per file.

Everything after the UV section, I don't know what they could be. I would imagine normals are stored with the faces.

Finale00,

Can you tell me how did you get your sample files ?

I downloaded the and installed the
  cityofdream_setup.exe

I downloaded and extracted the
  cityofdream-1.20110529.17.rar 

I got same files from these packages (from the model directory), but these are seem to be packed ( .dds files also).

Your c02unit01.gcf file is 79744 bytes. My file is 35888 bytes.

The "archive unpack" title I wrote is misleading. The script chrrox wrote will decompress the files

Thank you for your information. I readed the archive unpack thread already, but I did not understand it correctly. I did think it made for the .pak files only.
The script works on the model and the textures files also.
