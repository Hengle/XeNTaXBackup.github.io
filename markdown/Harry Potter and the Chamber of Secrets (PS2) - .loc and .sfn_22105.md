- Post Title: Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (PS2) - .loc and .sfn

Hello there!

I'd like to translate this game to Polish, as this is the only PS2 main Harry Potter game not released officially in Polish. Therefore, I unpacked the game's LOCALE.BIG file using FinalBIG 0.4 and I'm clueless as what to do next. There are a few files - mainly .sfn files, and the file that interests me the most - strings.loc. I can see this is the file with game's texts, but everything is mashed together. Could someone look into it and check if there's some way to convert it to .txt and put back into the game, please? My programming skills end at unpacking the files and changing values in hex editor   
Also, the .sfn files seems to be fonts, but I'd never heard of this format before. Is there a way to open it with ex. Paint.NET or GIMP and edit?

All files in attachment.
