Hi guys! Here's maxscript to import Middle-Earth: Shadow of Mordor (2014) PC models with bones+weights (3ds max 2009-2012) Script is in beta stage - there's an issue with bone-map, so weights referenced to wrong bones. I will definitely finish this and update the thread, just uploading script in case someone wants these models very much  

Tools for extraction could be find here [viewtopic.php?f=10&t=12035&hilit=shadow+of+mordor](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=12035&hilit=shadow+of+mordor)



P.S. Report bugs on char models which will fail to import, and send them via PM to me

Will it be possible to make a export script for max also? Therefore, I could add custom models to the game please let me know if it's possible.

Greatest thanks to the author of this cool script! I tested it on my Max 2013 (x64) and it worked nice for some sample characters models from [viewtopic.php?f=10&t=12035&start=90](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=12035&start=90) - it imports .mesh files into Max very fast and properly. But I have a couple of questions about models in this game and extracting them (excuse me in advance). At first, which tools namely I must use to extract game archives step by step to get to the mesh files? That thread is long enough and I cannot figure out which tools I need. If there are some ready extractors created already and really working, couldn't you post links to them here? I need to extract just meshes and dds files (textures), not music or videos. 
At second, is it possible to get to architectural models of Mordor etc so easily as with characters? Where are they located in game folders?

hint: some weapons failing to import can be inported by changing newBone.name = BoneNameArray to something like newBone.name = "1"
But I would love to have that bow.

No idea what all I edited, but static 2 imports weapons, what I tested, worked, and active works only for that bow, no other files as far as I know.
Simply I was digging into those three importzers that were acesible here intuil it worked.   I'm total noob about maxscripts.

Thank you for the updated script, it worked even with those two error orc files which someone uploaded above but how about UVs? I tested this script on several mesh character files - all of them were imported into Max 2013 correctly with bones but when I exported the meshes as FBX, OBJ and DAE, they lose UV mapping. Does your script allow to import Uvs along with geometry and rigging?

Update
I found one Possible decision, but for Maya, not Max
Actually, meshes have UVs, but out of Range 0-1, just below that range. Apply UVW modifier in Max and you will see it. So one have to manually return UVs to 0-1 standard range. In Maya they have the script MopGatherUVs.mel (attached), but what may be for Max? There must be a similar script or any tool. After repairing Uvs meshes can be retextured in any application.

I think like this user, I would appreciate a super brief walkthrough on how to get from gamefile to model.
I am new to this whole business of getting models from games, so I'm not quite sure of the whole process.
Do I need to extract or unpack something from the gamefiles to import?
And where do I find the textures, as they don't appear on the screenshots of models in this thread...?

Any help is appreciated, and thank you for your time...

Does anyone have files (raw or in any other 3d format) of this character? Don't want to install and extract whole game for one model:) [https://cdna.artstation.com/p/assets/im ... 1443932085](https://cdna.artstation.com/p/assets/images/images/000/519/198/large/m-walling-belrothbody.jpg?1443932085)
I'll be greatfull if someone could provide me a DL link, here or via PM if it's against rules. Thanks!

EDIT: Got the model! Thanks a lot to Erik945. Thank you very much:)

Zaramot, cracking work as always! 

Your new script will let me import a load of stuff that I couldn’t before, like Celebrimbor’s bow and Dirhael, etc.

However, whenever I import something and it doesn’t quite work, it falls into one or two categories.
Either something is missing from the model, or I get a straight up error.

[Things with stuff missing (hosted on my Dropbox, because I for some reason cannot upload to this site)](https://www.dropbox.com/s/zyzg0jcea80ojp0/SoM%20-%20Things%20Missing.rar?dl=0)
I don’t know if some or all of these models are importing correctly, what I do know, However, is that they do not exactly correspond to what I see in-game.
pl_skin01 - Dark Ranger Skin: Missing cape and hood.
pl_skin04 - Lord of the Hunt Skin: Missing cape.
pl_skin05 - Power of Shadow Skin: Missing cape and hood.
pl_skin07 - Lithariel: Missing hair, cloth around waist, and cape.
pl_skin07_loading - Lithariel: Missing cape.
player_talion: missing cape.

[Things that give me errors (again, hosted on my Dropbox)](https://www.dropbox.com/s/pajsieilvjng1gw/SoM%20-%20Error.rar?dl=0)
The biggest deal here are the Talion files, because I think these are the only files that contain Talion’s in-game skin (grizzled with his sleeve missing, etc.), which I have not anywhere else in the files.

Thank you! I will check them out:)

EDIT: I fixed the script, attached it in my previous post. Models which was with errors are now fine. Ss about for some "missing" parts, those missing models are in .hkt/.hkx files, since they're using physics (capes, hoods, skirts, cloth and so on). In order to get such models, import player skins with word "load" in it. They should have everygint inside, I tried it myself. Otherwise someone need to make tools for havoc files and get models out of there xD Because, there no any other geometry in them except which, that was imported already

Thanks for looking into it.
