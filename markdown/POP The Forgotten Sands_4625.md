- Post Title: POP The Forgotten Sands

Hello everybody!

I am finding a way to translate the new language for my POP (The Forgotten Sands). I managed to extract the text, however, it is encoded.
I've attached the file to be translated.
I hope that will help me in this work.

Thank you!

Are you sure the file is correct? Because when I download and unpack it, it contains only 00 bytes. No data.

Yes, at least in the POP 2008 was the same.
This attachment has 64KB, and has no extension.

I think it's right.

I think it was not extracted correctly. Because you cannot decode/decrypt something usable from file filled with zeros.

I have used your Maki, also my Maki i have on HDD. Both detect POP2008 archive, but after extraction it gives 'Unknown data compression' error. So I think that Maki's plugin must be updated to support POP:FS. 

But maybe somebody have another way to unpack .forge files. Who knows

U won't be able do that until forge format isn't supported fully. 

Maki's author appears doesn't have a time for researching...

I also want to translate AC, POP'08, AC2, POPFS

As author said it's probably doable only with POP'08 and AC2, but still i couldn't find nor font for the firts one nor way to decode text for the second one.

AC2 has such text file and it's need to be decoded as Maki decodes text for POP'08
