- Post Title: Wipeout 2048 .gxt textures

Hi, I tried several tools from internet to extract image files from .gxt files but all of them aren't working (tried with noesis too), one of them (GXTConvert v08) pointed out the format the texture uses is not implemented (PVRTII4BPP)



Here are some test files and the little info i found about the format.

Samples: [https://drive.google.com/file/d/10PCW0S ... sp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/10PCW0SawG255i2YbzrSwCTtdmWE5B25W/view?usp=sharing)

GXTConvert used: [https://github.com/xdanieldzd/GXTConvert](https://github.com/xdanieldzd/GXTConvert)

From this post there is a code that uses the PVRTII4BPP but i don't have idea of how can i use it with these textures

Cool script! But I usually don't upload modified scripts from other authors. Will send you the patch tomorrow.
