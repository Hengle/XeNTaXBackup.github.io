- Post Title: Editing .uexp (DataTable) Files? -Translation of Switch Game

Hey Guys,

I bought "My Hero Academia: One's Justice" for Nintendo Switch yesterday.
The Game was released yesterday. The US Release is planned for the 26.10.2018.

The funny thing is, the Game already contains all Language already and I was able to replace the japanese Texture Files with the English ones.

Unfortunately the TextStrings for every language are saved in one uexp file, which means I can'tjust look for the english files and replace the japanese ones with them.


The TextStrings are all stored in uexp-files (DataTables). Unfortunately I don't know how to edit them so I can change the japanese Texts with the english ones.

I've uploaded these Files on my Server so you can take a look at them.
