script updated:
[http://aluigi.org/papers/bms/7x7m.bms](http://aluigi.org/papers/bms/7x7m.bms)

now it supports also the non-xored archives like this one and automatically guess the xor number in case of archives that use a number different than the classical 0xf7

i gave up on this a long time ago since no one can find out the info for the game  it would be nice if someone can make an extractor
