- Post Title: TAKEN [$500] for finishing 3D tool

Hello Xentax community,

I'm looking for someone that could help me finish a 3D program/tool that I haven't been able to fully complete. The program is coded in Visual Basic .NET and what it basically does is scan a 3D format and then converting it to .FBX . At the moment what is missing is some bones conversions and how to transform triangle lists into triangle strips, the later is for importing back into the original format. 

Requirements missing:

*Transforming triangle lists into triangle strips
*Exporting bone data (if any)
*Importing into original format (static model)
*Importing into original bone data (if any)

Provided:

*Source code on Visual Basic .NET (include comments)
*Sample files

Rewards:

* $250 usd for importing into original format static model 
* $250 usd extra for adding bone exporting and importing

//rewards would be payed through PayPal the moment any requirement is met

Please contact me for source code and sample files. This is done for a personal project and more knowledgeable aid is highly needed.

Thanks.
