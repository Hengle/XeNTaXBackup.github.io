G'day, was wondering if you would be able to create plug-in for MotoGP 3. File format - .ark (ARK)

Thanks.

Hmm no magic identifier, no directory(at least no file names), gives us several possibilities:
1. there's another file containing the directory (normally with the same name but a different extension)
2. the file or at least the directory is encrypted and/or compressed
3. it uses a hash table instead of filenames (rather seldom)
4. any other possibility that I missed

Well if it's encrypted it's a good way to disassemble the main exe and investigate the algorithm.
