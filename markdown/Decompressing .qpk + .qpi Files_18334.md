- Post Title: Decompressing .qpk + .qpi Files

I am trying to extract the files from the PSP games Heart no Kuni no Alice ~Wonderful Twin World~ and Shinsouban Clover no Kuni no Alice. Both use .qpk and .qpi file types. I have been able to extract the files from the ISO's, but I am have a lot of difficulty getting into the .qpk and .qpi files. The .qpk ones are larger and contain most of the actual game files. Any help getting into the files is appreciated.

The company that made the games (Quinrose) is defunct, so the license is no longer held by anyone.

Thanks in advance~

Here are examples of the files I mean. Since the company is defunct, I don't believe it's an issue to post them, but if it is, I'll remove them:

qpi: [http://www.mediafire.com/file/49ox56zi0 ... 0.QPI/file](http://www.mediafire.com/file/49ox56zi0b80qcz/DATA0.QPI/file)
qpk:[http://www.mediafire.com/file/rksf2fwxl ... 0.QPK/file](http://www.mediafire.com/file/rksf2fwxll3rgkx/DATA0.QPK/file)
