- Post Title: Wakfu [Java MMO] .anm files

Hi,

I would need some help decoding these .anm files. 

I think they are sort of json files containing animation data linked to atlases (images full of sprite) so the .anm files containt the necessary informations to animates these atlases. They seems to be Little Endian from what someone told me et not encrypted.

From TrID, they seems to be Unknow format and are not linked to any animations software known.

Thanks.
