i have a DATA.PSP and DATA.PSAR, 2 very important files for the psp, if you could support these, that could save PSP modding as we know it 

I understand that the EBOOT.PBP is an excutable and it cannot be supported, thanks for trying tho!

Thanks for everything!

I will take a look at them soon. Could you perhaps enlighten us with the context of these files - like what the files are supposed to be/do and what they are used for. I don't mind helping out, it will just make it a little easier to investigate knowing what it is.

Sorry if I'm interrupting but "Data" to me often refers to stats/text/scripts or mixed types including the mentioned with images, sounds, and music. But it would also help to know where these two are from and such.

i myself have not tested these, but the data.psp and data.psar contain the data in an EBOOT.PBP, these come from the 2.0 update, thx for taking a look at these

ok well I looked at them - they don't have any data in them of any use - they are just executable files or something like that. These files can be thought of like an *.exe file for the PSP - they don't have anything useful in it, they are just a program.

At least thats what I have determined.
