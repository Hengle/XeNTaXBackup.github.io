I am not sure if those files are compressed files.
I pretty sure those are the files that encrypted.
Can anyone figure out what those files are?

I uploaded some.
Thanks for help!

it's a precompiled lua script so you need a decompiler to read it (well it's not like the original lua file but it's better than nothing):
[http://lua-users.org/wiki/LuaTools](http://lua-users.org/wiki/LuaTools)

section "Assembler / Disassembler / Bytecodes"
I have tried with this [luadec](http://luadec.luaforge.net/) and works, while the others listed there had some problems
