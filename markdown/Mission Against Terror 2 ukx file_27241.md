- Post Title: Mission Against Terror 2 ukx file

Hello folks, I am trying to view the game content of this game. The contents come in the form of .ukx, .usx, .utx files. They cannot be view directly using umodel viewer, as they are encrypted. However, there is a tool that can decrypt the files: [https://www.mpgh.net/forum/showthread.php?t=449186](https://www.mpgh.net/forum/showthread.php?t=449186)

The resultant usx and utx files can be viewed directly using umodel, but the ukx file will produce errors.

Game link: [https://mat2.cibmall.net/maindownload.html](https://mat2.cibmall.net/maindownload.html)

Drive link (includes the tool, sample encrypted and decrypted files): [https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/ ... sp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1MiUi8tSQ-91F2ad_nRA8CJRGNfkw5mU_?usp=sharing)

Any help would be appreciated, thanks in advance!
