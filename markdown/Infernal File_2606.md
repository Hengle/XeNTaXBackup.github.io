- Post Title: Infernal File

I want to edit some of Infernal's screens and a friend of mine send me the file -attached one- with a note "search a while, you can find a way to edit this".

I can only find this is a DXT1 file with S3TCDXT1 header...
I do not know how he extracted this and no tool i can find with holy google...
Anyone can help and show me the way to edit this please?

Oh thanks...I needed another file to test with. I had the height & width variables backwards but thanks to this post I think it's working now. The only problem I see is I forgot the mips=1 in the header so WTV doesn't like it but Photoshop is OK with it.

 Remember it's upside down 

 Things to remember:

 Create a temp folder and copy all the files you want to edit into that folder.
 Do not change any filenames after editing.

 What will happen:
 The file above has no extention and Photoshop won't load it even after conversion and this tool will mess it up.
 So to eliminate that problem add the DDS extention before converting with this tool. Convert and load into Photoshop (or equivilant) then save exactly as the converted name. Then remove the DDS extention if you must after converting back to original.
