- Post Title: Megaman X Command Mission - Battle Sounds

About a week ago i was looking for an undubbed version of this game. When i found it, i noticed a few graphical glitches, which is expected when modifying files, i didn't mind it.
But i wanted to change the battle sounds because the rom that i found have them still in english. I figured because if one changes these files, some commands become unreadable. However, i still want to change the battle sounds, so i ended up looking through the files, however, i hit a brick wall and i can't figure out where those audio files are exactly because i don't know how to open the extensions that are shown in the root folders.

I am not experienced in how to look through these files in order to modify them correctly, can someone lend me a hand in this? I would really really REALLY appreciate it if someone can explain to me where do i start looking and how do i work with these types of files.

I uploaded the folder to mediafire because it was taking forever:
