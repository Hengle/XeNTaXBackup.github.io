- Post Title: Inuyasha Feudal Combat .XAG Files...

Hello everyone, so, to put it simply, I've extracted the Songs from the BGM folder with "MAGIC ISO" and they won't play correctly for some reason...I've uploaded one of the BGMs to Send Space, please have a look at it and tell me what you guys think, ok?
