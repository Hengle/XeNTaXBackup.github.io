AC7 is an unreal engine 4 game and can be extracted with base UE4 bms script and corresponding key. Though you can't do a lot with extracted assets, since many of them are additionally obfuscated. There are a lot of AC7 modding guides in the net or even compilations of them, like [this one](https://superostrich.xyz/ac7.html).

Ok thanks. Maybe Ill look at something else. Seems AC7 isnt modder friendly as you said. I suppose the only reason to mod AC7 is to mod airplanes.
