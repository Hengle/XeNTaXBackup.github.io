- Post Title: Blue Reflection - KSCL file

Hi', I'm working in the translation of this game, the KSCL is a kind of container that has various images and probably some scripts, the images are (maybe) KSLT, is a kind of image format that I can't read with any kit tool like SpecialK to dump them in-game, fortunately some people have helped me with this type of image and I can edit them, but they don't know how to deal with the KSCL file and extract the images inside.
