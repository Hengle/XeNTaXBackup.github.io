- Post Title: FreeJack.WA / Freejack.WH

There are 2 files 1 file table (FreeJack.wh) and then the container for the actual files. (FreeJack.wa)
I already got the resource files and put them on a directory. Now I want to repack them into a new modified "Freejack.wa" to use it into the game.
I just need a resource tool to re-decrypt them into a modified one, or just modify the file into it.

Thanks in advance.
