DUST 514 is an F2P FPS available on PSN and is a counterpart to EVE Online.

and I'd like to be able to add character models and small arms to it. Mr Mouse has permitted me to post the official (PSN) download links:

The patch is only for people who want all the content.

These are two tools you will need, a PKG unpacker and a PSARC unpacker.

I unpacked the PKG and it seemed the standard UE3 layout with a CookedPS3 folder instead of a CookedPC. The CookedPSARC folder contained standard PS3 packages that can be unpacked with the tool above. It produced a lot of XXX, TFC, other UE3 files so I copied them to CookedPS3.

Then I used Gildor's uModel tool to try and unpack them all with the -ps3 -uncook -sounds tags. This is where I run into problems. It unpacks animations and textures, but no meshes or sounds, and 99% of the textures were stripped to 64x64. CharacterIcons_SF.xxx extracts perfectly.

The uncook option groups everything in identifiable folders. GA, CA, AM and MI are faction prefixes, WP for weapons, CH for characters, etc. I contacted Gildor but he says he can't reverse engineer PS3 games for his tool. Any help?

Well it seems Ravioli Explorer can handle the sounds fine.
