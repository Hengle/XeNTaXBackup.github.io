- Post Title: Soulworker - unpacking a data pack

Hi guys, I'm not sure if this is the correct place to ask but I was wondering if anyone knows how to open the Data09.v file for Soul Worker Global.

I have found an app called xor and it seems to unpack it properly but then there is a password protecting it. Does anyone know how to bypass this password? I have looked online for cracks or tutorials but I'm still too dumb to understand it.

If anyone is able to help, that would be greatly appreciated thanks!

Can you upload a sample?

Also, by XOR you mean "xor.exe" from aluigi? If yes, then it's not an unpacker, it can just decrypt data.
And what do you mean by password? You mean XOR key?

As for tutorials, you can go here [viewtopic.php?f=29&t=22266](https://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=29&t=22266)

Hey, I've found the password for the data now as someone else shared it with me.

To answer your questions, yes i meant the xor.exe and by password, I was referring to the decrypted data being passworded.

I will take long look at the tutorial, thank you very much and sorry for the trouble.
