I know thats make a long time that you have made this post and I don't know if you still interested on it, but what exactly are you looking on theses .rib files?
I was looking for dialogs sound,you know, I also thought that those .ribs had a kind of sound, but I didn't find any tool to open. 
But, I saw that .SFX file, and it have a lot of sounds. You or anyone else that want play and import sounds from manhunt, can use that GTA wave, MFAudio or any software that can play .sfx files.
As I said, I really don't know if you still interested on it, but I can up these tools.
