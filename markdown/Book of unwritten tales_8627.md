hi, I don't know much about 3d formats,  I'd like to render (view) a scene as in the game. 
All files necessary are available in proper subdirectories , meshes, tga-s and .osm-s , after some googling I've found out that .osm file is a scene export of 3ds max's plugin called oFusion but I was not able to find a tool which could load the scene. There are some sources(scene loader) in c++ to compile but I know nothing about c++. Has anyone it compiled and could it upload for me, or is there any tool to view the scene?
