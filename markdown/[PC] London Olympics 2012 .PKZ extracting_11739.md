- Post Title: [PC] London Olympics 2012 .PKZ extracting

Hello there Xentax!

I am currently creating a project requiring swimming sound effect files and so I am attempting to rip the swimming sfx out of London Olympics 2012. 

I would love it if one of you could direct me to extracting this .PKZ archive. I believe the filenames that include fsb at the end indicate that they are indeed FSB sound archives that I can then freely open with a program. But I can't get to that stage without finding out how I can extract the .PKZ. Any assistance would be appreciated!
