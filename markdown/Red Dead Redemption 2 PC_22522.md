I heared that renderdoc is an perfect way to get the models with but the problem is i can't hook it to the game since i have it on steam there is something called global hooking in renderdoc that allows you to inject to games with launchers but i couldn't find any information about how can i enable it or make it work and there is another way that u can use the ps4 tool and download the rdr2 ps4 game files and get the models i can link you the game files if you need them
