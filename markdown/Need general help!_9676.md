- Post Title: Need general help!

At first, im sorry if this isnt the right section, if not, please move it. thanks 

Hello guys, i have learned many things from here and from the tutorial from n64 youtube guides.
But i think i kinda need more general help at all.
At first i followed the tutorial and tried to make my own script, it works (a little bit) it reads the floats and shorts and append it to an array and i can build an mesh with this. BUT
this mesh looks like this 


and this is not the way it should be, is anyone here willing to add me on msn/skype and try to figure it out with me? 
I dont need help from scratch but i would like to have someone who knows how to do it and he could explain it to me in any way.
If you are willing to help it would be nice if you could throw me a pm 
thank you

First thing that comes to mind is a vertex read issue.

Either you are not reading the proper data for the vertices, or some of the data needs manipulation prior to loading it into 3DSMax.

Without seeing the model data and your import code, I cannot give you more information or a fix to the resolve the issue.
