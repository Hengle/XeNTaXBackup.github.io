- Post Title: Madden 19.apt files

Ayo everyone! Ive been working on a mod for madden 19, and I have ran into an issue. I need to figure out what this apt file means, and how I can edit it. It looks encrypted somehow. I'm kinda at a crossroads, because I really don't know what to do with it. Look for a converter, look at it in hex, or just give up. So, i'm just trying to figure out what to do with this. Thanks!
