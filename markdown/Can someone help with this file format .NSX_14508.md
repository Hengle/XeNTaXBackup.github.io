- Post Title: Can someone help with this file format? .NSX

Alright so I've successfully opened up the files for this game and now I need to figure out how to view the 3D models.
The models are in some strange format, .NSX
Tried searching everywhere but there's nothing about it.
None of my programs can view it.
Here is one of the folders.

Rumble Fighter uses this format.
It's an outdated game which the company completely neglects.
We haven't had new content in months.

Also how do you open it?
That looks awesome!

Thank you for your information.
I added the .nsx loader module to the 3D Object Converter, but I did not released it yet, because I need more sample files to test it.
