- Post Title: Help Making a Reverse Free Form Deformer

I'm making a lattice based volume FFD and I'm having trouble with data gaps doing a typical deformer. I think I need to go through the voxels in the deformed lattice and then find the corresponding undeformed coordinate, that is, go from having the deformed position to getting the local (s,t,u) coordinate that was deformed to that position. This is obviously the opposite way of doing a lattice based FFD with vector valued trivariate Bernstein polynomials. I am struggling to figure out the equation that would work. If anyone has any advice it would be much appreciated.

Thank you!
