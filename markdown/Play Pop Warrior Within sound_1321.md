- Post Title: Play Pop "Warrior Within" sound

I wrote a litte program which reads the *.fat files of Prince of Persia - Warrior Within and extracts the selected soundfile out of the *.big file.
But now I have a problem:
  How can I make this extracted files playable??

Do I have to convert the files, or are they in a playable format??
