Does anyone know how to unpack Unity3D web player files, e.g. one like this
[http://www.perthracer.com/game/perthracer.unity3d](http://www.perthracer.com/game/perthracer.unity3d)

I think its game build engine something like Flash only in full 3D and stuff. So I think it has scripting, 3d models, textures etc. Looks compressed. Anyone know how to unpack it (and get 3d models and textures at a minimum)
