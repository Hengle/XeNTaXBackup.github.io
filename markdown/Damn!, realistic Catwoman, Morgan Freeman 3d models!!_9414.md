pretty interesting; I can only imagine the shenanigans that 3d morgan freeman will be getting into now...

I'm curious whether there is a way to use a picture and make a high-quality model out of it.

Yes, there is finale00, ever tried reality fighters? for psvita? well one can take a photo of themselves and "place" it unto a pretty high quality model. looks amazingly top notch too...

mr. miyagi is also the final boss. looks good too...

That's a case of skinning an existing model. As long as the model is carefully designed, and the algorithm to match the texture to the model is clever enough, you'll get passable results.

finale00 was asking about taking a picture and generating a (high-quality) model from it, which is another matter entirely. Even if there were software to do it (and, outside of security/government applications, I don't know if there is), it wouldn't generate very high-resolution models, and it would have to extrapolate (read: guess, based on averages) for the areas that aren't in the picture. This, of course, assumes that you're talking specifically about generating human models. If you broaden the question to generating high-res models of arbitrary objects, that requires strong AI.

Not necessarily a single picture. Could be a set of pictures of someone (or something) from various angles so that the computer has more data to work with and less extrapolating to do.

It's the same basic answer for that case, except in such a case the computer has much more work to do, since it has to figure out how to stitch the views from the different pictures together, requiring it to account for angle, distortion, and different positioning of body parts, etc. Even after all that, it also has to normalize light levels and somehow account for areas of the texture that did not appear straight on in any of the pictures (and which are, therefore, not as detailed as the rest of the texture).

Without the goggles she kinda looks like Milla Jovovich

It's called Photogrammetry,

check out a free program from autodesk called 123dcatch.

(however you'll need many photos of the subject)

Those look really good.
AFAIK morgan freeman was done entirely in zbrush (aswell as some other but don't know about that Anne Hathaway catwoman )
