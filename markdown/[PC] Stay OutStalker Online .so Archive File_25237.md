- Post Title: [PC] Stay Out/Stalker Online .so Archive File

Hello everyone, this is my first post on this forum and I am very much a beginner at ripping video game assets, so please excuse my lack of knowledge. Anyway, I am attempting to rip files from the game Stay Out, formerly known as Stalker Online, which are all packed into .so files. They can be converted to .zip or .rar and viewed through winrar, however most, save for ones containing sound files, cannot be extracted without a password. How would I go about finding this password? I believe there is a key that the game's .exe file uses to unlock these files on boot to clarify, and I have mostly been attempting to find this key via debugger. Any input would be much appreciated.
