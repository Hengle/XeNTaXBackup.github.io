- Post Title: Super Paper Mario models and animations?

Hello fine folks! I've been searching for ways to export Super Paper Mario models and their animations for ripping purposes. I was wondering if someone here could possibly create a proper model and animation viewer based on a previous program and game mechanics...

I found a topic that has probably one of the coolest programs I've seen for the Paper Mario series. It's on the emutalk forums. [http://www.emutalk.net/showthread.php?t=27613](http://www.emutalk.net/showthread.php?t=27613)
Here is the link.

Now, I don't know much about the games methods of compression or it's internal engine, but I AM fairly certain the method of organization is similar. I think the textures are in the extensionless files with a "-" at the end, and the models themselves (along with animation data) are in the extensionless files without the "-". We need them to somehow coordinate and I believe R-II on the forums above may know something about them. Anyway, I was hoping someone would like to look into these and see what the deal was, so here's the entire pack of them.
(I have to use FileFactory because sendspace isn't working properly for me for some reason.)
