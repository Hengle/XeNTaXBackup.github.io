The game co-developed by Square Enix and Team Ninja of Koei Tecmo
Archive is dz
Texture is g1t
Model is g1m

I have tried LG DZ extractor, but I think the file are different so LG DZ extractor not work.
g1t header is GT1G0600 look like [Kaizoku Musou3](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=18&t=14572)
g1t can view with TextureFinder. Characters, Weapons textures maybe in .dz
