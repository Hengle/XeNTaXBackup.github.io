- Post Title: War For Cybertron: DS versions

(Does this go here, or in the Game Archive Research section?)  Regarding War for Cybertron for DS, either Autobots or Decepticons: I promise I've scoured the net for solutions before posting here; I hate to ask for help... but I'm not having much luck here with capturing or extracting.

I wrote a long thing here about all the emulator and 3d capturer combinations I've tried, with no luck, but I don't want to put anyone to sleep.  Suffice it to say, this is The Game That Will Not Be Captured (at least on my machine)!   

So I'm looking at extraction.  Being a Vicarious Visions game, I'm assuming it's using the Alchemy engine, but I haven't found any information on the file formats.

I've extracted the contents of the .nds (either the Autobot version or the Decepticon version, the core contents are the same, I discovered), and I'm not sure what all of the file types are, but I'm attaching samples of the kinds that interest me the most.  .texture, I know, are the model textures in some sort of bitmap format (a hex editor reveals the image, but there doesn't seem to be any information header, therefore, no built-in palette that I know of) and .model, which appear to be character models. .SAC I think are 2d character portrait sprites, among other things, but not in a bitmap format (hex editor reveals garble).  .pal names don't correspond with any texture names, only GUI-type-stuff, so I don't know where the palettes for those textures are coming from.  

All of these file types are dumped together in one big directory.  There are other very interesting things in there, and if someone would like to get a look at the other kinds of files, that'd be great, but I'll settle for a way to have static, preferably textured models of characters.  If anyone can successfully capture from the game, that'll work, too.  

And if anyone wonders why I'm wanting models from this thing when the PC/XBox/PS3 War for Cybertron models are in a known format: there's a lot of exclusive characters in the DS version, and I'd like a framework on which to make higher-res versions of them, to match the other games.    I'm a modeler/animator, not a programmer so much..  

If you want any more info/samples, just ask.
