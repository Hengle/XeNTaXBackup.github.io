- Post Title: Crossfire REZ files

Hey folks 
I would really like to be able to extract .rez files from the Game Crossfire ([http://crossfire.z8games.com](http://crossfire.z8games.com))
I tried several tools, but did not succeed. 
Game is protected by XTrap, so would modding work? 
I uploaded several rez files, you can download them here:

It's a modified version of the Monolith REZ file format: [http://wiki.xentax.com/index.php/Monolith_REZ](http://wiki.xentax.com/index.php/Monolith_REZ)
But the end of the file (the Directory table) is somehow encrypted.

So there is no way I can edit these?
