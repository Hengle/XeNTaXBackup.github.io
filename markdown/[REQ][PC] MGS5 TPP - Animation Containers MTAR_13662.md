- Post Title: [REQ][PC] MGS5: TPP - Animation Containers MTAR

The animation containers in Metal Gear Solid 5 are MTAR files, nobody seems to have looked into them. Animation swapping would be a nice door to open for MGS5 modding.

So if anybody could look into maybe writing an unpack/repack tool for these MTAR files, that'd be terrific.
