Here is version 0.1 of a Noesis script.
Supported.
models, textures, materials, bones, weights.
not supported "yet"
advanced material effects
animations.
if you don't see textures auto loaded just copy them to the same folder as the model and they will load.

much time has passed. no news about animations?
scrip work not properly. to bones assigned wrong vertices groups. for key_1_C_1 bone assigned leg_3_L_1's vertices, for leg_3_L_1 bone assigned leg_3_R_1's vertices, for leg_3_R_1 bone assigned ribbon_2_R_1's vertices etc.
