- Post Title: Question about zlib

a-.I tested the zlib compression, not bad ,better than zip or rar sometimes
b-.I optimized the png's with the compressor of ken silverman, and are compatibles with normal png's
c-.Tested too the compressor KZIp from the same author


The question is:

It's in any site a zlib "optimized"? i mind with more compression than the normal and compatible like kzip or similar?

Thanks

zip and rar use the same compression algorithm (in fact deflate) like zlib (but rar a slightly optimized one).
png also uses deflate to compress the picture data.

So am I right assuming that you want an optimized compression algorithm to use in pngs?
You could have a look at 7zip. Afaik they use an improved version of deflate.

Yap, i have optipng and some png optimizers, but i tried some zlib's codes and i dont' reach the compression of this packers

And 7-zip is not solution, i tried
