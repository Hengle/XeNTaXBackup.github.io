- Post Title: Tekken Tag Tournment anyone?

I think you're wondering right now "why not just study the Tekken 6 models"? And "TTT 2 is coming soon".
Well imo in Tekken 3/ TTT the character designs were great, and they look quite different in 4,5,6. Not to mention some characters/costumes are missing. I really like the Tekken 3 character design (Yoshimitsu the most) and they look decent in TTT, so why not?
So has anyone tried hacking the formats?
Are you willing to?
I can help with providing sample files (if the archives are extractable that is), and I make Blender scripts, so I could make an importer for Blender if you would explain the format.
Anyone interested let me know.
