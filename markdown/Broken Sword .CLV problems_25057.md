I am having this problem with Deniz's CLV extractor C:\Users\jaker>C:\Users\jaker\Downloads\extras-broken.sword.directors.cut\CLUExt\CLUExt.exe "C:\Users\jaker\Downloads\extras-broken.sword.directors.cut\broken_sword_original_game_002\Broken Sword Original Game.app\Contents\Resources\game\clusters\maps.clu"

It's called "CLUEXT" from Deniz Oezmen.
[http://wiki.xentax.com/index.php/Broken ... rs_Toolset](http://wiki.xentax.com/index.php/Broken_Sword:_The_Shadow_of_the_Templars_Toolset)
(for the future - you should link to the software you're using if download link is available somewhere)

As for your question, usage is explained in readme file and on the wiki.

```
Usage: 	CLUEXT <RIFFile> <CLUFiles>
```


So you need two parameters, RIF file and CLU file

```
CLUExt.exe file.rif file.clu
```
