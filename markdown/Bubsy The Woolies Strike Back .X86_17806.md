- Post Title: Bubsy: The Woolies Strike Back .X86

Hi! I was looking for ripping models from Bubsy: The Woolies Strike Back and found a couple of .X86 files inside the Game.pak, i checked in Hex Workshop and apparently those are model files, the same format used in Giana Sisters: Twisted Dreams(as it wasn't obvious already, the game reuses engine and assets from giana sisters). From what i know there are no scripts or tools for ripping models from the game, and that's why i came here.

Here's some samples:

Any sort of help is greatly appreciated
