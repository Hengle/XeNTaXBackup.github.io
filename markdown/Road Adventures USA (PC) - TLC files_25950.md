- Post Title: Road Adventures USA (PC) - TLC files

I have this old PC game, from 1999, called "Road Adventures USA" from the Learning Company, a 3-CD PC game that has, what I think are, game archive files on each of the 3 CD's. These files have the extension ".tlc" which makes me think that they are indeed game archive files as TLC is\was the abbreviation for the Learning Company. I would like to know how I could use quickbms to uncompress & find out what is in these files.
Here is the RoadLoc.tlc file that is on the first CD:

If necessary, here are a couple of sample files generated by loading the RoadLoc.tlc file into quickbms with the filecutter.bms script.

Please help, thank you.
