I saw in youtube there was a third person mod for the consoles but nothing for the pc.
I try to find the values to change it & i found there is some files who have the value first person/third person

Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Vegas 2\KellerGame\CookedPC\Packages\Camera
there is two files 
TakeCoverCameraConfig.uppc
CameraConfig.uppc <- i am almost sure this is the file i need to mod
&
Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Vegas 2\KellerGame\CookedPC\NoAutoSync
RS5CameraTrees.uppc

i try to modded the files with lot of ways & hex programs to change the first person to third but with no luck (it has an error & doesn't start the game)
Has anyone manage to make this work or the uppc is a package file and need a tool to extract & then change the values?
Thanks for any help because the idea have stuck on my head and i try this few weeks now to make it work but with no luck at all.


Ps: Sorry for my Eng!
