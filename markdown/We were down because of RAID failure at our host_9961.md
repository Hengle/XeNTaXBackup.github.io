- Post Title: We were down because of RAID failure at our host

We were down for about 36 hours because of a multiple RAID failure at our host. They fixed it! Seems they did a very good job!

Our apologies for the inconvenience.

Cheers,
Mike

Did you by any chance reset the database in some way?
It seems like my most recent posts are missing, as well as my PMs. I also lost the session data and had to login again, and now all topics are marked as unread.

Thanks for letting us know. This is caused by the crash. I will inform our host.

Great to know you are working on it! 
Honestly, I have already gotten used to it and reposted my deleted posts, so it is not that important. Thanks anyway!

Well, they took the latest backup for the fix, and all posts between that backup and the moment the RAID failed are lost (less than a day). . .

A day doesn't sound too bad, unless that day happened to have a lot of activity lol
