Hi, guys ^^

My friend wants to ask a question, but he doesn't have an account here.

> Hi. I'm trying to translate a Syphon Filter game from psx to my language. I know what to do with other files. My only trouble is that graphic from menus and mission brefings are encrypted in .OVL files. Can any one look at this example file and see is there a possibility to make exporter/importer to this files?

Wortest this version is because in game menus are ripped of from briefings at pause, and few more menus. Maybe if someone compare this files eu with japan will find diffrences and similars with both of them, and be able to find how japanload folder works. After this maybe will be a some way to encode others tims.
