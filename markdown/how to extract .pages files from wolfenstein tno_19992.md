[https://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php? ... 27#p146427](https://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=19145&p=146427#p146427) alright, according to this guy
the vtex tool doesnt work on windows 10, and i use windows 10. so is the solution is to just ask for the textures, or is there another tool to extract textures. because there really isn't a simple way to extract the virtual/mega textures from id tech 5 games.
