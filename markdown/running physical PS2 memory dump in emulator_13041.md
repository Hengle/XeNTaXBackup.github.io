- Post Title: running physical PS2 memory dump in emulator

Hi, I made a memory dump of a game on a physical PS2. I want to load it into PCSX2. I tried hexing over a savestate I made in the emulator, but it just made a black screen. Is doing this possible? Thanks.

IIRC, PCSX2 dumps each section of memory (GS, VU, etc.) and compresses then into an archive.
