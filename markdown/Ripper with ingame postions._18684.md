- Post Title: Ripper with ingame postions.

Hello,

I am looking for game ripper that maintains the in game positions the same way 3dripperdx did. Unfortunately it doesn't run on anything after dx9, Ive tried a rebuild the application in visual studio but that still didn't work.

Pleases let me know, i've been smacking my head against this for about a month.

Thanks in advance.

Thanks in advance.there's no such ripper and I don't think anything similar going to pop up any soon. The games are too different and too complex these days. So creating such tool would take a lot of manhours â€” I don't think anyone skilled enough would take a pass to create it. If you really want that kind of stuff I would suggest you to learn how to reverse formats so you can get anything you want.

What do you mean by reverse formats?
