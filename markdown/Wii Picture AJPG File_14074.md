- Post Title: Wii Picture AJPG File

[https://www.sendspace.com/file/ishry3](https://www.sendspace.com/file/ishry3)

This seems to be a using RLE, LZ or/and Huffman but none of the tools I usually use to decompress those (NTCompress or DSDecmp) don't extract these.

This seems to have a TPL encoded with RGB565 in it but I can do this part.

I'm very desperate to figure out how to decompress this, someone please help me.
