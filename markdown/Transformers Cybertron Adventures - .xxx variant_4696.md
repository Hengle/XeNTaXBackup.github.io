Doesn't work. If you had downloaded the samples you would have seen it yourself and wouldn't have needed to post here.

It would help if you could go to his [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/pages/Unreal-Model-Viewer/138478386167196) page and add youself to the list of people who "like this".

Gildor has [said](http://www.gildor.org/smf/index.php/topic,523.0.html) that he won't release the updated version of umodel until at least 25 people have said on facebook that they like his program.  Right now we're at 18/25

Great program Gildor!,
works like a charm with the steam version as well

Is it possible to add recompression as well? so models can be added to the game?

thankyou.

I need the DLC files for the 360 decoded from the LIVE format. I've found a way to include them in the PC version, but I need them decoded into a readable format first. Can anyone help on this?
