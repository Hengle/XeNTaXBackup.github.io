Nostalgia hit me, when I saw a compilation of old german games.
I got this .vmo file from a game that I believe to be Lula 3D...
could you please have a look at it and help me extract it?
Thank you for your time.

Heres some example files:

v3d and v3o contain ASCII data, i.e. are human readable.

Was using the params here in a wrong manner for the first attempt:
D, 297, 995, -1177, 237, 69, -66, 791, 809, 0, 0, 0, 0
Using -1177, 237, 69 as x,y,z results in the upper object:

2nd try still dead ugly, but obviously kinda mesh. Used 297, 995, -1177 now - really don't know the cause of my previous choice. 
(So it should read D, x,y,z, nx,ny,nz, tx, ty, ..., something like this.)

Which leads us to the question: 'why is the "Sekretärin" so ugly, using the same procedure?' 

btw: I could send you the tool but the "procedure" is dead ugly, too.

The answer is very simple: the Sekretärin uses bones.

You must use the bone position information to transfer the vertices to its correct position.

I found a blender script for Emergency 4 .v3o model that seems to work fine with static models, but pushes every part of character to the center.

The .vmo files contain animations. Do you think they contain/sort the skeleton?
Heres a character with .v3o and.vmo file:

(Maybe you'll find a .vmo script from Robert Smilie?)

Thank you!
I checked for .vmo info/scripts already...only had somebody confirming that its an animation Format.
