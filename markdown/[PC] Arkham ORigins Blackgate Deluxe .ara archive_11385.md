The game is out on Steam today, and it is made in the Bluepoint Engine.

There is an archive called Ozzyarchive.ara and is 1.5 GB. 

Here are some HEX images. The game is made in BLUEPOINT and uses cmdl models and cxtr textures I believe.

Finding a Xentax thread for a format I made is kind of hilarious.

I HOPE YOU GENTLEMEN PAID FOR THAT CONTENT.

I paid for the game, enjoying it so far, i'm happy pc is getting all these vita ports, at least the good ones! black ops declassified can stay far far away from me.

Also the format isnt compressed or anything. it's not that hard to figure out, the filenames are even shown.

That being said, I have no idea how to extract anything other than the wwise adpcm waves from it.
because I'm a terrible person who takes everything the community does for granted!

This DET table with filenames gives nothing. Table separated on 2 blocks. First with file ID's, second with hash's, size's and offset's. As hash used fnv1a with uppercased strings. I still do not understand the partition with ID files.
