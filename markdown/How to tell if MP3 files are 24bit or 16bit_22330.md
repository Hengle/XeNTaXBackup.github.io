- Post Title: How to tell if MP3 files are 24bit or 16bit

I have MP3 files from Dragon Age Inquisition and Dragon Age Origins, and I'll be editing and tweaking them in Audacity. To prevent loss of quality, I'll be exporting them in FLAC as I always do with lossy sources. My only question is whether to export in 24bit or 16bit. I know that OGG files are always 24bit, but I can't find a way to tell the bit depth of these MP3s. Importing them in iTunes doesn't display the sample size as it does for lossless files. One thing I did try is use MediaHuman audio converter to convert them to ALAC, and used the settings to output as "original" for channels, sample rate, and bits per sample. When I added the new ALAC files to iTunes, the bit depth was listed as 24bit. However I don't know how reliable this is, and my instinct is to go for 24bit if I can't be sure, but I'd be saving a lot of space if I used 16bit instead. I just don't wanna waste the space on 16bit source files that were unnecessarily upsampled to 24bit.
