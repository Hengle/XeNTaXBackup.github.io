- Post Title: Serious Sam 3 - BFE .gro Archives [PC]

So, the game is out and i will have my copy soon but the files are again in .gro extension (previous Serious Sam games use this extension). Maybe the archives are zlib compressed but maybe i'm wrong.

Can anyone help us? (i say "us" because there are many users that want to translate the game)

Sample files >>

Two of the main .gro archives are big (1-2 gigs) so i can't upload a sample file(s), sorry  

All_147662.gro - Link coming soon when i finish uploading the file

Yes, WinRAR/7zip opens them normally but the game crashes with 


Stream is signed with insufficient credentials. (Content/SeriousSam3/Config/autoexec.cfg)

when i change something in the translation.tbl file (All_01.gro - Content\SeriousSam3\Locales\enu).


Maybe the file size is the problem that causes the game to crash but i don't know how to do a workaround or something so the game can read the edited file.  

File sizes-

Original translation.tbl file - 129KB (132,983 bytes)
Edited translation.tbl file - 129KB (132,695 bytes)

Alen Ladavac from Croteam is a really cool guy and he will usually respond to PMs sent to him on Serious Forums. Ask him if there's a way to do a translation without modding the game. But I think he'll say the same thing I'm about to say right now... there is code to prevent people from modifying the archives. Probably will have to do some EXE hacking...

But then again read this:

Alen replies the unrestricted version should accept modified GROs and I do believe BFE comes with a sam_unrestricted.exe?
