- Post Title: help Project tokyo dolls 3D models

Hello forum I have a doubt about how I can extract 3D models from the Tokyo dolls game of android and that have a T-pose, once I use ninja ripper but they appear incomplete, I also used a tutorial of this forum on how to extract asset models, it worked with other games but with this I only see .abab files and I don't know how to open or decrypt them, there will be another way to extract them. Thank you and I await your response
