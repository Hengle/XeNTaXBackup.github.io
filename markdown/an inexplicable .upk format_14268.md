- Post Title: an inexplicable *.upk format

Here is an upk sample found in a chinese online game claimed to be powered by Unreal engine 3.5. I'm so interested in the contents of the game but using tools commonly found on the Internet is completely futile. Could anyone have a peek at the file? Many thanks.
PS:All upk files found in the game have the similar hex header as the one i've uploaded
