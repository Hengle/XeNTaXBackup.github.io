Hi ~!
Can you help me take a look at this encrypted .CCZ and .PLIST File?They are used as Ekey encryption tools for encryption ([http://zenhax.com/viewtopic.php?f=9&t=129&hilit=CCZ](http://zenhax.com/viewtopic.php?f=9&t=129&hilit=CCZ)) but I still couldn't open the normal conversion and PVR after decryption, seem to have a layer of encryption, can you help me take a look at how to open them?Or take their ideas?
