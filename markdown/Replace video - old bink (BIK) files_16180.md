- Post Title: Replace video - old bink (BIK) files

Hello. Has anybody tried to replace BIK files in some old games? I want to generate BIK file using RAD Video Tools, but after replacing game crashes, because replaced file is "too new" for this game. I tried also generate BIK using old version of RAD Video Tools, but the oldest version I found is 1100k ([https://www.videohelp.com/software/Rad- ... d-versions](https://www.videohelp.com/software/Rad-Video-Tools/old-versions)).

Any suggestions? 

Here is the screenshot from original BIK file's info:

hi,

what year is the game from?  The oldest version of radtools on the site is from 2014 , my guess is, it's not old enough. Have you checked if the game video files are BIK1 or BIK2 ? 
I have a really old radgametools installer year ~2001, maybe it could help.

Have you tried to replace old bink dll in the game with newer one, perhaps it could play your new video files.

Yeah, I tried that (a few different versions of binkw32.dll). That trick worked in game Zanzarah: The Hidden Portal, but in my case that's not enough.

> what year is the game from? The oldest version of radtools on the site is from 2014 , my guess is, it's not old enough. Have you checked if the game video files are BIK1 or BIK2 ?

Game is from 1999. It's called Urban Chaos. Format is BIK1, you can see that on the screenshot.

> I have a really old radgametools installer year ~2001, maybe it could help.

Please, upload it for me. It could be really helpfull.

Use value to compress audio above 100, for example 104.

Thank you Edison007 and peter2005 for your replies, but unfortunately none of these methods works. Game still crashes or skips BIK when I try to load old BIK or BIK with 104 sound.

I discoverd that game uses version 0.8 or 0.9 of binkw32.dll and RAD Tools newer than 1.0 didn't work in that case. To solve this problem I need RAD Tools 0.9n or older. ([http://www.radgametools.com/bnkhist.htm](http://www.radgametools.com/bnkhist.htm)). If someone have this version, please share it with me. 

And these are files that I manage to find in web since my last post (and a mirror of your installer, peter2005). Maybe someone find it useful someday.

There is also an interesting mod of bink library. It can be useful in some cases.

Thanks a million. Who knew there were such old tools?
This is getting off-topic, but I must ask:
Do you happen to have some EA/Electronic Arts (BlackBox) tools for .mad files?
I need to change audio from such files. But all I know is that it's an old format.
Currently I try to make new NFS Underground play new videos.
Thanks.

Edit:
It seems to work with FFmpeg.
But how do I get the extension to .mad? It doesn't let me save as source format.
Also I can't seem to replace the audio file, maybe I have to look further into the program.

To be honest, I don't know.

As you can see on these sites 
[https://ffmpeg.org/doxygen/1.0/eamad_8c.html](https://ffmpeg.org/doxygen/1.0/eamad_8c.html)
[https://ffmpeg.org/doxygen/1.0/eamad_8c-source.html](https://ffmpeg.org/doxygen/1.0/eamad_8c-source.html)

there is decoder defined, but there is no encoder. 
I'm not an expert on video stuff, so I am not sure how to write such encoder.

Ok. Thanks anyway.
Maybe someone else knows more.
I saw threads like this on some SimCity forums, but no further success.

I can provide a dumy file for purpose. The batch automation is work in progress...
