Well, this is really weird, as I have just repeated the process and MC neatly highlighted my matching files in a zip file with more than 10 or less than 10 files. 

Could you state exactly what you do before the crash?

Thanks.

Well, this is even more weird as the processing of the ZIP file seems to function as it should. How about extracting stuff from it. Does that work okay? Could you send me a small zip file that will give this error?

Thanks again.

Well, of probably course not, because nobody informed me,right?  Let's just wait and see.

That may be a problem with unzip32.dll not being "unlinked" to a crashed MultiEx Commander. If you start MultiEx Commander again, it can't get access to the dll, because it is still linked to the formerly crashed one. 

However, the search crash is still a mystery. 

For the all file extraction,instead of one, I do think that is a bug in MultiEx Commander, and I will see where it is to fix it.
