- Post Title: Need some help extracting files from Acclaim SBB archive

Hopefully this is in the right section. So, I was going through the "Dakar 2: The World's Ultimate Rally" gamecube iso and I was trying to find where the multi boot GBA roms were stored. It looks like they're all included in a file called "GBA.SBB". Hereâ€™s the directories for the SBB file & RBB file:
res/GBA.DAT/RBB/GameCube/GBA.RBB
res/GBA.DAT/RBB/GameCube/GBA.SBB

I opened up the file in a text editor & found 13 .bin files that match up with the GBA downloadable files listed in-game:
DAKAR2CREDITS.BIN
PARIS1.BIN 
PARIS2.BIN 
PARIS3.BIN 
ROCK1.BIN 
ROCK2.BIN 
ROCK3.BIN 
DIRT1.BIN 
DIRT2.BIN 
DIRT3.BIN 
SAND1.BIN 
SAND2.BIN 
SAND3.BIN

And here's how they're listed in-game:
Mini Game Setup
Artois
Le Parc
La Petit Ville
Sun Baked
The Canyon Run
Driving On The Edge
Savannah
Muddy River
Mudbath
Sahara
The Dry Heat
Oskar Beach

I was wondering if anyone knows how to open up a SBB file/archive?  I've [uploaded both files](https://www.mediafire.com/file/p3sqt94qp3lvmpy/SBB_RBB_files.zip/file) (just in case the RBB file is needed).  
I'd dump the multiboot files directly from the game via just playing it normally but, my gba is busted, I don't have a working GBA->GCN cable and I'd need to get an EZ Flash IV/Omega device.  

Any help at all would be extremely appreciated.
