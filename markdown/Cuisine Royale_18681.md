- Post Title: Cuisine Royale

I saw that Cuisine Royale uses the same engine as War Thunder, I tried using the Asset Viewer from War Thunder sdk but only managed to see the textures and giant corrupted mess (Possibly because I just threw the content folder into the War Thunder's content folder). Is there anybody who is able to find a way to see the models in their normal state?
