Hello! I am seeking some assistance on getting the model files for Roller Coaster Tycoon 3 to load up on the Model Researcher tool. I am new to reading hex and am having trouble spotting any possible vertices or faces. I am using the tool Game Extractor to open the .ovl model files for the Ghost Train Coaster Car file [https://imgur.com/gallery/P7Vjirb](https://imgur.com/gallery/P7Vjirb) Here is the files when looked at with Game Extractor. I have taken them out and am trying to get the .ric file which is the Ride Car file into Model Researcher Any help would be greatly appreciated!
