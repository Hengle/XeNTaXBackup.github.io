- Post Title: The Witcher 3 .xbm files

Hey,

I know there are tools to do this but I'd like to understand the XBM format. I know they are normal CR2W files (like .w2mesh) and from what I gather they are dds files without a header. I tried to find a quickbms script for W3 .xbm files but couldn't find a working link. Does anybody have info on that?
thanks
