- Post Title: [Request] Wild Arms 3 .BIN (PS2)

So, I was able to determine the BTLMON.BIN file on the Wild Arms 3 game disc for the PS2 had models, and that there was another file named BTLANM.BIN, which obviously might have animations of characters and monsters in battle.

I have included a link to the BTLMON.BIN file so people could look at it.
