- Post Title: Sonic and Sega All-Stars Racing .zig and .zif model formats

They have been extracted from Racers.xpac.

These model files hold the tracks and the character models, which I want to extract to 3D software. Not much seems to be known about this format though, let alone ways of extracting the models from it. But apparantly it's a type of archive.

.ZIF example: [http://www.mediafire.com/download/h6f12 ... atcher.zif](http://www.mediafire.com/download/h6f12g1eu50qu47/BillyHatcher.zif)
.ZIG example: [http://www.mediafire.com/download/g6y01 ... atcher.zig](http://www.mediafire.com/download/g6y0174pcrtb2f0/BillyHatcher.zig)

both samples are zlib compressed, here is a bms script for that  

```
get SIZE asize
get NAME basename
get EXT extension
string NAME p "%s_dec.%s" NAME EXT
clog NAME 0 SIZE SIZE

```
 

the zig file contains model and texture data.
the zif file looks like an index file for the zig file.

(well, Ace, how it comes to answer this request one and a half year later?  )

I've cut out the DXT5 file from BillyHatcher.zig_dec at offset 0xCC554 (.. 0x221B44) with header.
