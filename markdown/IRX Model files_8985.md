- Post Title: IRX Model files

I've been searching for ages for something to extract these files.. I'm sure that these are the model files because the only other files on my game disc are the movie files and a few other things.
So I'd appreciate any help.
By the way this game I'm trying to extract models from is Graffiti Kingdom.
Thanks!
