- Post Title: Custom tools for MultiEx

Good work on syndicate format mouse, it really helped. I have noticed that some game formats have no description of the files and apppear as unknown. 

Can you add a tool that would input filenames from an external .txt file so when you extract or view the files will have the exported filenames. If there is not enough filenames in the file, then the rest would still appear as unknown.

Also, can you add a utility similar to windows file types, so you can use different programs to check out the formats, because some of the formats like .raw files cannot be viewed through multiex, you have to run an external program to view them.
