I'd like to edit fonts, but alas I cannot. TTG Tools (the "complete edition" or TTG Tool made by quckly is not able to opet .FONT file from TWD The Final Season. It says "Texture header was encrypted, but I decrypted" message over and over again - I have to close the program via program manager

Most of the .font files are in TTF or OTF format with custom (Telltale) header and tail. Sooo hex edit them 

Two .font files remains in "old" texture format, but it looks like they are not used in the game.

The pinkish part is what you are looking for. You have to replace it with modified/another TTF or OTF file you want.
My modded fonts were no bigger (purple part) then original so I had no need to figure out what else is needed to rewrite in .font file.

TIP: OTF (OpenType) format is usually much smaller than TTF (TrueType) and game doesn't care in what format was the original font.
In other words, you can put there TTF or OTF, it doesn't matter. Ex. GameplayDisplay.font contains TTF font, but I put there OTF. No problem.

I have made Czech, Slovak fonts, so yes I tried it. And right now I have sent Arabic (or Farsi?) fonts to @elybelbely, so if they work, then I know how to replace fonts of any size. (and it's stupidly easy)

Does it work just by putting modded .font files to Archives folder? Or you had to repack it into .ttarch2 archive?

DCCSharpDistress.font and default.font are probably not used in the game.
And no, there are 4 different fonts. But you can use any font you like, it's up to you.

I tried replaceing GameplayBody.font with new font data and the game crashes before entering main menu.

I replaced font data block length with new number and copy-pasted font data with HxD.

[https://drive.google.com/open?id=1e-H2m ... 9yZMWMC7nk](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1e-H2mMpigLiEWum3VmTMGU9yZMWMC7nk) Here is the font I want to put in the game.

Can you please help me?

==== Edit ====

New font should be smaller than original font..

It means that you: didn't change the data length, main length (which is not on my picture) or you rewrote some other byte.

So you can edit fonts by yourself? Or you want me to replace them with Noto Sans?

No problem.

@binlv: Send them and I will import them for you. Then you can compare edited with original, to see what was changed. It's really quite simple.

Some crude scripts to export/import fonts from The Final Season. 


Example: You want to swap font in menu for [Pacifico Regular](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Pacifico)

1) Use Exporter on MenuBody.font file (you will get MenuBody.head, MenuBody.ttf and MenuBody.tail)
2) Delete (or rename) MenuBody.ttf
3) Rename Pacifico Regular.ttf to MenuBody.ttf
4) Use Importer on MenuBody.head, you will get MenuBody.font_NEW
5) Put MenuBody.font_New into "The Walking Dead The Final Season Episode 1\Archives" folder and rename it to MenuBody.font
6) Run the game

If everything worked, you should see your new font in the game.

You have done something wrong, mine menu works and it ain't crashing. Just look over for missing space in file.

We have almost completed polish version, but we're struggling with custom title. At the start it wasn't even showing when we've compiled the d3dtx, after removing the fillers inside hexeditor (now it has exactly same weight) that's best, what we could receive.  Anybody know what we could do?
 We had to use copy /b in the command prompt, because ttg tools couldn't handle the dds.

Yes, but the original sentence was on two lines, and yours in in one. So your file has 279 lines in total, but english file has 280. Could this be that issue? 
I can't export landb file to exactly the same format as you have, I maybe have a different version of TTG tools.


@VOID: Which file (and archive) is that logo?

It's DXT5 with no mipmaps. 

Header's length: 0x130 or 304 bytes
Texture data: 0x100000 or 1048576 bytes

Can somebody test this version tool? It supports extract and import TTF fonts but I didn't fix yet bitmap fonts of the last Telltale's game.

Hey again. As you know subtitle is showing left to right in game and is like typing from left to right. I translated the game but my language is Right to Left and I want to edit the subtitle typing to be RTl. I think I have to edit "ui_subtitle_text.prop" file but I have no idea how to edit it to be what I want. Any help with this? Thanks.

Just put the fonts next to the archives, no need to pack them.

The menu and other font files for each game are different. But if you are looking for the main menu of the launcher, look in the "MenuBody" and MenuDisplay files.
