- Post Title: On Converting Bink .bik to .wav

Hey guys, I have a question. I am trying to convert some.bik videos to .wav, and I thought it would be a simple matter of using the RAD Video Tools. However, whenever I tried to convert any of the .biks, the .wav is corrupted. I also tried converting some of them into .avi, with the idea of using Sony Sound Forge of then converting them into .wav. No dice again - no matter what codec I used it was corrupted.

Obviously, the people who made Bink are pretty clueless.

So, my question is: do you guys know how I can convert .bik files? Thanks!

 try using audacity and record the sound as it plays on your computer
