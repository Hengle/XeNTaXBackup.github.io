- Post Title: Wiki URL format

Hello all, I've got a question for you. If you've been paying attention, you will have noticed that the URL appearance for wiki pages changed after Mr.Mouse finished the upgrade. The original style was along the lines of
[http://wiki.xentax.com/index.php/GFFC](http://wiki.xentax.com/index.php/GFFC),
whereas after the update, it became
[http://wiki.xentax.com/index.php?title=GFFC](http://wiki.xentax.com/index.php?title=GFFC).

My question is: what is your opinion on how the URLs should look? Should we return to the old style, stay with the current style, switch to an appearance in line with Wikipedia, Wikia, etc., or do something totally different?

Part of the reason behind this is because I'm preparing to go through every topic in the forum (a scary task... 0_0) and post all format specifications and BMS scripts to the wiki, after which a link to the appropriate wiki page will be posted in the topic. By getting this out of the way now, I don't have to worry about going back through and changing lots and lots of links in the future... unless I get that wiki BBCode I asked for...  

You'll have a few weeks to vote and let your opinions be heard.

[http://wiki.xentax.com/wiki/GFFC](http://wiki.xentax.com/wiki/GFFC) has my preference.

Aah, glad to hear that there's consensus. I should have mentioned, the length of time the poll is open actually depends on how many votes are made over what span of time, and how they are distributed among the choices. The way it's going now, I may close the poll in a few days rather than waiting two or three weeks.

Hmm... It seems I did some stupid thing with the poll, so the four of you who voted before, your votes were wiped. You should be able to re-vote, though.

All right, the poll results are quite stable, so I've decided to begin working on the necessary updates today or tomorrow. This means that the poll has been closed to votes, and any further votes will be disregarded.

When the change has been fully implemented and tested, a small notice will be posted on the main website, a news entry will be posted on the wiki, and an announcement will be made here on the forum.

On a side note, I'd like a little input on how the script path URLs (for example, for editing pages or purging page caches) should be structured. If no one responds, I'll just set them up the same as Wikipedia does it ( [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Page_title](http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=%5Bi%5DPage_title)&action=action ). I realise I probably should have posted this earlier, but better late than never, I suppose...
