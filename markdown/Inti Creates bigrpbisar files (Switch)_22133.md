- Post Title: Inti Creates bigrp/bisar files (Switch)

So, it turns that a couple of the more recent Inti Creates games have their own audio formats (the titular bigrp/bisar files). I was wondering if there's some way to decode/make them playable somehow? The titles in particular are [Blaster Master Zero II](https://drive.google.com/open?id=12-fSm-4YvbJ-bEmzsUB-fUotO9gXqVnF) and [Dragon Marked for Death.](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1TXnWyAdqHOOS1gdvIPE6VZo1zDbal59n) Thanks a bunch in advance for any help on the matter!
