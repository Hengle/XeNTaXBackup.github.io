- Post Title: .res to .obj format (wii)

I ripped a 3D character from The Penguins of Madagascar Wii but this file has a .RES format, no .BRRES. It also happens with PS3.
How can I extract it?

This is the file:
[https://www.dropbox.com/s/xw1myp3f6rep9 ... e.res?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/xw1myp3f6rep9ma/marlene.res?dl=0)

Maybe is not a sound file, 'cause it appears in the /characters folder.

Faces appear to be incomplete

but I wouldn't bother since I don't think that the threadopener will ever return. 

btw: it's not a quads problem; looks as if face culling were "on", but isn't

For this is the perspective of the individual.
