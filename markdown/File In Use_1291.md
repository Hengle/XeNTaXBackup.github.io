- Post Title: File In Use

After clicking on (not extracting or anything) a file that errors "Error while decompressing..", I can no longer edit the archive until I restart MultiEx, wheather or not I'm using this file or not. I want to delete (well put a 1 byte file in its place) with this useless Korean 9mb file in this archive, but I can't cause of this dumb error.

This error was discussed earlier. Click on another file in the archive that does not give this error, and then cursor-move to the file that gives the error. Mexcom will not try to decompress it. Then select the file you wish to get in there. Click the Arrow button (pointing right). And thenactivate the process of replacement. 

The file is too big for a preview, hence the error. Will be fixed.

Thanks MrMouse! I guess I didn't look good enough to see if this was discussed
