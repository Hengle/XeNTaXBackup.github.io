- Post Title: GR Wildlands Specific 3D Model, I will pay for them

Hi!

I am new in the forum, I found it, looking for extracting Ghost Recond Wildlands 3D models.

I am from Bolivia, I need a 3D models of a dance, in order to make a demo with them.

Attached a image capture of the dancer.

I will pay for that work, by Paypal or other wire transfer method.

If only can extract the obj model: ok.
If extracted the textures and mapping also: better.
If extracted the bones and animation: the best.

We can talk and agree with the price for this job.

Please contact me by pm or by skype: carlos.olivera.t

Thanks!

Carlos.
