- Post Title: Era of Legends mobile game (3d models)

Hello, I was checking models from Era of Legends mobile game, and it uses Unity, this .bytes file can be opened with AssestStudio but there is not any animator type file, so can't export the mesh as .fbx, the weird thing is that there is a type file called TextAsset that contain some data related to armature (bones), maybe the animator type is encrypted? or what could be the trick to get it?! Thanks for read!   .
