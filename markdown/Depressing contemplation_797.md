Realising, I have worked on and off from March 26th 2004 - till June 29th 2004 on the "upgrade" from 3.9.70 to 4.0.0. An upgrade of 0.0.3. 

But WHAT an upgrade. 3 months of on and off coding/designing. 

And what do I get?

Nothing. 

.
.
.

Nothing at all. 

This shit has been under development by yours truly from 1997 on. 

It's now 2004. 

That's -7- years. 

7 years of working on and off on MultiEx Commander. 

Isn't 7 some kind of divine number?

I believe it is. A period in which whatever you're doing comes to a final end. 7 years of happiness, 7 years of sorrow. 

7 . 

Seven. 

S3v3n. 

I think nobody will read these very words, coming from me at a period 7 years advance of the year when I first started programming and designing the first MultiEx in Turbo C. 

You know, I'm 29 now, so going back, I was 29-7 = 22 at the time when I first started thinking about a way to cover all game resource archives in a single program without the hassle of having to code every single game addition in C, VB, ASM or WHATEVER, but by just adding a simple text file, representing a simple but effective script. 

22. 

That's young. 

I'm turning 30. 

This hobby has gotten out of hand. 

7 years of idiocy. 

I'm glad a lot of people like(d) what I did, during those years. 

Perhaps, somehow, in some personal way, it was worth it. 

Then again, we all die, so it's all pretty futile anyway. 

It may very well be time to quit MC.

Hi Mr. Mouse,

Your words sound like that you want to go offline and discontinue this project.
Please do not do this step. Please do not!!! Please!!!

Well, I am a litle disappointed:

Between your version 3.9.70 and 4.0.0 there are nearly no changes except the "You must be online to use my software"-feature was switched off.
Why did not you improoved the [file formats](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?t=758) and add [some new](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?t=758)?

To Paulus, thanks!   

To Borg Number One, you are definitely mistaken, because in fact there have been a lot of changes. If you read from the start of this thread  to the post where I announce that 4.0.0 is a fact, surely you have noticed that in fact a lot has changed since 3.9.70.

The reason I only added 5 new formats is BECAUSE I had to write on the new version so much, that I didn't have time to figure out more formats. I explained this in different posts in this thread. 

As for quiting the project, I have not decided yet wether I will quit it or not, so for the time being the project is still on.

Okay!

To Borg:I have added the RES format of the games you specified. 

Use the Webupdate function in MC to get them!

Thanks! I have decided I can't stop, it's not in me to stop this. It's like an addiction. And your kind words did help a lot too.

You have helped alot of people I'm sure. This is a great program with a great idea behind it.  Even though I have to be so DAMN stubborn/impossible/obsessed/determined to try and get my favourite 'unmoddable' game modded (for myself, no legal issues here), I just dont know when to back down!  But in finding your program, though I havent found success yet, it keeps me fighting on. That I know there is a solution even for games that dont have a SDK out.  Even though I am a tad discouraged because of the programming/math involved in trying to explore and extract file formats of a game that are put together in a specific way that only the game developers can understand and access.  It is very frustrating for me to not give up, but do you know why I dont? CAUSE OTHERS HAVE.  For every person that tells me to forget it, I get even more determined to find out how to do this....  What does this have to do with you?  Well certainly over the years you've found some impossible game archives to open or perhaps you've come across bugs that took ages and trial and error to solve. But you didnt give up did you?

Whether it is for your own experience/pleasure, or for other people's, rest assured that you did not waste this time. Perhaps I would have no hope at all to try and do what I want to do if I wasnt pointed to a link to your program.

As long as its worthwhile for YOU and you know you can do more with it, keep at it. We appreciate it.    

As for me... *sigh* I wish I could be one of those people who would give up.  My mind would be at much more ease....      Ahhhh welll.... lol

Oops this is an old topic!    !  Ahh well, thanks for continuing your work a year later!
