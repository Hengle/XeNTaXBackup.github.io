- Post Title: MultiEx download link not working

Hi,
I donated last week for MultiEx, and received a download URL.  However the file does not download.  Instead it opens as text in my browser.  I've tried both Firefox and IE8.  Any suggestions?  I've already used 3 of my 5 attempts.

Help.  I've tried 3 browsers and 2 PCs.  All I get is text.

I'm not trying to annoy or spam, but is there someone I can contact about this?

Sorry about not replying before - I figured Mr.Mouse would see this, and there's no way I could help with it anyways, so I held off. In the future, I think I'm going to reply regardless and let Mr.Mouse know instead of just assuming and staying quiet.

Thank you sir!   The download works fine.   Now I just have to get the app to run without breaking.  

"ERROR: 339-Component 'MSCOMCTL.OCX' or one of its dependencies not correctly registered: a file is missing or invalid"

I'm running Win7-64, and running XPsp2 compatibility mode.

Ok, I got that fixed, and now I've got the dreaded "COMDLG32.OCX" error.   I've downloaded and registered that file from numerous sources, but it can't get it to work.

Have you tried running without compatibility mode? MexCom shouldn't need it set to work properly on Win7 (though I can't test this myself since I never got a download link for the most recent version *hint hint Mr.Mouse * )...

OK, I have to be the most inept user here, lol.

I have zero issues downloading files from anywhere else that I've tried in decades of computer use.

I turned OFF all of my antivirus/firewall, etc. security and tried the download link again. All I get with Firefox and I.E. are blank screens. At least last week it would pop-up the requester to ask me where to save the file before telling me the file was inaccessible, etc.

Are the free download links dead now or is there another suggestion I can try? This is getting ridiculous here as I see others having no issues.

Thank you in advance!

Download links are still there. DId you try downloading it from another computer? I tried it on multiple computers, no problems. 
I would nevertheless be interested in finding out what is wrong at your end, since it may affect others. 

Perhaps this will help, but I am sure you tried that.

Sometimes certain files are handled by the browser in an automatic fashion. Be sure to have everything on manual. Try Chrome if you can. It may still be a firewall problem, what router are you using?

I'm getting worn out. LOL

OK, I disabled my firewall and antivirus protection in ESET, I disabled my Smart PC Care software that scans for malware, I turned off Hitman Pro Alert from watching my browser activity. I went to the link you quoted and cleared my download history, checked for download manager plugins,  changed my default action for downloads to go directly to a temp folder instead of "ask every time where I want to save the file".

Same blank screen in I.E. and Firefox when clicking on the link you sent me. I am sure I have way exceeded 5 attempts from that link, assuming it counts attempts instead of actual downloads?

I have Verizon FiOS internet using an Actiontech router they supplied.

I have ZERO issues downloading any other file anywhere on the Internet... just this link from your Email for MultiEX.

Name and emailaddress you used to download it? More than 5 times downloading will result in no more downloads.
