I donated how am I getting the serial, by email or what?

There's no rush.

Ah.. I should really remove that Source Forge thing. They take a lot of money, and it takes some time. Do you remember the date you donated?

EDIT: I see you donated, yet there's another email attached to it...something at valinux.com. Anyway, I sent you the key just now. Should have arrived when you read this, probably.

It seems to have something to do with Sourceforge.net... When you visit, it redirects to vasoftware.com...
