- Post Title: Bully: SE (Wii) BMS Format, [XSB/XWB...?]

Hello.

The reason why I want to rip audio files from the Wii version is because I have access to three RVT-H (which is a Wii Dev Console) Beta builds for this game.

Being a BMS format, the first obvious solution is QuickBMS, however, the BMS script used for the PC version doesn't work. I assume it is because this version of the game works with big endian numbers, as this was the cause for every if not all problems I had with ripping files from it.

I uploaded a sample for that, so if anyone that wants to help can try using it.

I apologize if sharing files of this nature is not allowed here and I ask that if that is the case then just edit my post so that it has no link instead of removing it altogether.

If the above happened, DM me at samp#7135 and I'll send you the files.

Also would like to apologize for the files being too large in size, I made sure to upload the .bin with least size to it.

 EDIT: I was able to rip most of the game files by using fsbext, however, Speech.bin gives off an error as if it was encrypted and password protected
