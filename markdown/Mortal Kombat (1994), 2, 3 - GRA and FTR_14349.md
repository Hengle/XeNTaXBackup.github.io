- Post Title: Mortal Kombat (1994), 2, 3 - GRA and FTR

I'm a fan of a lot of old games and it's surprising to me that there isn't more interest in old games and their file formats, and that more of them haven't been unpacked. A lot of cool retro sprites and backgrounds and such. One such game is Mortal Kombat by Acclaim with its revolutionary use of digitized actors.

Seeking simple unpacker for GRA files of original Mortal Kombat DOS Floppy/CD version as well as Mortal Kombat 2 GRA and Mortal Kombat 3 FTR.

My understanding is that Game Extractor unpacks MK3 FTR but opening an FTR, the contents aren't recognizable, so even if I could make Game Extractor work, I'd have no idea what to do with the contents after they're extracted.

An extractor that dumps all graphics from these games would be awesome.
