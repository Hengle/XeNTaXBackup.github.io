First of all, I'd like to thank Bugtest for his tools.    

I made a few BMS scripts for QuickBMS for UFC 2009 Undisputed for the Xbox 360.

You can see the results:

Edit: There are now three different scripts

Ok, I can extract what I believe is a model file, I am however no expert in models, could somebody download this sample and see if it is familiar to them?

BTW, I added the yobj file extension based on the header inside the file, this is not necessarily called a yobj file.

Also, this is an Xbox 360 file format, so the file should be big endian.

Interesting, Randy Couture was originally in the game.  They took him out of the game, but didn't take out all the mentions of him.

files looks like 3d data to me, but I don't know alot about getting 3d models out. things are stored in polystrips for the 360.. and I never quite figured out how polystrips worked.

anyway there are bone name references as well that indicate that this is a 3d file. the only doubt I have is the size of the file. 130kb is very small for a model file. but for sure you can see repeating blocks of data that look like 2 sets of float points.. probably for the polystrips.. the second half of the files kinda looks like texture data though.. man that's alot of crammed in stuff for a 130kb file

The reason it is small is that it is not the model for the body, it is the model file for the trunks I think, hence the t on it.  I purposely chose a smaller model file, so the file size would not be too big to upload here.
