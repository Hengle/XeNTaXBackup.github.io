- Post Title: Electronic Arts game *.mus files

Hi there 
I'm having issues with some music files  from the GameCube game 007: From Russia with Love developped by Electronic Arts. The sound effects and the dialogues are stored in *.exa files which I was easily able to play. The musics on the other hand are stored in some obscure *.mus files. I tried importing them as raw sound data into audacity and I was eventually able to recognie the music, abeilt filled with noise. The frequency seems to be around 20KHz. At last, after examinating the file with an hex editor I noticed that those files contain not one but several audio file headers as you can see on the screenshot I posted below, so I'm assuming that those *.mus files are some kind of audio archives. 

Does anyone know what I could do to rip those music files? ^^"

Well nevermind, after more searching I figured out that this tool => [blog/?p=771l](http://forum.xentax.com/blog/?p=771l) could extract the audio chunks from those files. Why would they split the tracks into so many files though? In the PSP version of the game, the music files are stored in a way more straightforward way.
