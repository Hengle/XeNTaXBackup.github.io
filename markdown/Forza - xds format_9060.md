- Post Title: Forza - xds format

Hi xentax, 

I was wondering if anyone will be able to help me with a file extension named xds ?  I'm a pretty big noob when it comes to textures so bare with me 

anyway what i want to do is say like put my own texture into the xds format.

I know so far ..
first 53 bytes are xds header and size info
It has a alpha channel
1 pixel = 4 bytes, first 3 bytes are like say raw pixel data so like ff0000 = basic red (some other extensions use same style)
4th byte of the pixel means if alpha or not (make it = 00 becomes invisible unless alpha off, or make it FF and the pixel shows normally)

[http://www.mediafire.com/?67b69o7dpbs2d8g](http://www.mediafire.com/?67b69o7dpbs2d8g)  example xds file.

the pixel mapping (or w/e it's called) is different from the main known extensions and some people said it's similar to dds but i don't see any resemblance

Sorry that im a big noob ^^ and any help is greatly appreciated
