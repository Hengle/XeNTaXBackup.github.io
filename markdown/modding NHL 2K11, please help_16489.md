- Post Title: modding NHL 2K11, please help

Hi guys,
I'm working on this mod for more than 2 years using Dolphin and custom textures.

I really wish I could improve the sounds and models, but I just cant figure out how to get to the actual game files from the iso. All that I can see is 2 big game compressed (?) files and few small system files.

I attached the start and the end of one of those big files and structure of the iso, as Luigi suggested to me.
Please let me know if anything is needed.

Thank you very much in advance.

The work djneo has done on this 2KHS mod is fantastic (look it up on youtube/facebook) considering it has all been done through dolphin and codes. It would be really interesting to see what could be done if we also figured out the file formats.

Does anyone here (that happens to see this) have experience of similar game structures and any ideas of where to start?
