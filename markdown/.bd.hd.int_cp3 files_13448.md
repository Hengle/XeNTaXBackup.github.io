- Post Title: .bd/.hd/.int_cp3 files

So I came across an PS3 game(ICO & Shadow of the Colossus "HD Classics") and I explored what's inside it. Thee were three .psarc files for each folder. Inside two of them were many undiscovered files that are still waiting for reverse-engineering. One of them are .bd, .hd and .int_cp3 files. My guess is that they're some kind of PlayStation ADPCM sound formats, yet there was no audio plugin for foobar2000/winamp yet.

Any ideas in what they could be and how to play/convert them?

EDIT: So I used VGMToolbox to extract the .bd file. It worked, except the fact that the extracted folder had .bin files. Any ideas on how to manage these .bin files?
EDIT2: As I go further on the format, I realize that these .bd are actually pcm files so I renamed the file extension to .adpcm(and making a copy of the original .bd file, of course). The problem? On foobar2000, it played TOO DAMN HIGH! What I heard instead was garbled audio garbage, since the plugin(vgmstream)did not produce accurate results. More on that later.

Here it is, but only the .bd/.hd files at the moment, since I'll have yet to extract nico.psarc which can be even more time-consuming(6GB when compressed, even more when extracted).

You encrypted the files. Can't download.

The first one I tried is OP1.

This is 5 minutes music stereo track encoded in PS ADPCM without header. So header information must be somewhere else.

Though, if you make a header for this (with GENH) with 48000 or 44100 stereo file, you can decode it. I did.

stg4a2nd(bin_cp3) - is a list of filenames, with some properties

op1(int_cp3) - another music file, also stereo, but now with interleave 0x400

Also, both music files seem to be not complete, like the files are cut wrong.

And the BD/HD files are soundbanks. And this is the most complex structure for any engine. We won't probably be able to reverse the structure of a bank HEADER (.HD), which is a list of parameters and properties.

So you can just decode the BODY (.BD) to audio files, as you did. They are again PS ADPCM, usually mono. The one I decoded (com_amb) contained some birds tweeting, and the noise of a forest, wind, water. All in about 22050 khz, mono.

Yeah daemon1, I tried the bin_cp3 files with the method you suggested and it worked. But the result wasn't perfect, however; it's still garbled audio, which results in some creepy music.

By the way, how did you get to examine the files? I always look at them through an hex editor.

Interleave must be different. Try 0x10 or 0x400, or something else. I was able to get perfect sound for every file you sent.

I use hex editor too.
