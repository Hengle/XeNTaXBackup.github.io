- Post Title: UnityEX Advance and Ultimate

Hi! 

I want to extract English localization data for the lexical analysis of different games.  
I tried using UnityEX but when I import the localization file, there is a pop-up saying that I would need an advanced or ultimate version.
Does anyone know where I can pay for this? Or is there another program that could be used?

I am targeting a lot of games since (I hope) this could become a big project. 

I really appreciate your help and recommendations
