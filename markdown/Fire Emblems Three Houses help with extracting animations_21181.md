- Post Title: Fire Emblems Three Houses help with extracting animations

Hello!
I extracted models from Fire Emblems Three houses.
It was a long way. And i need help. So i unpacked game to get animations. I'm using Stiven's Gas Machine 
[http://sticklove.com/xnalara.org/viewto ... 9b1dce0bbd](http://sticklove.com/xnalara.org/viewtopic.php?f=17&t=1001&sid=0cedba159b245ffc82e80c9b1dce0bbd)
But to open and import animations i need a script or somthing else. 

Stiven's gas machine can extract:
.g1m - models
.g1t -textures
but
.g1a - animations!
.g2a - animations! - there is nothing to export them.
I search a way to get them.

link whith g2a files.
