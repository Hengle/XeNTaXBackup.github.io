Hey dude, you have to calm down instead of asking useless questions everywhere.
No-one released a fully working tool to extract GT5-6 cars.

Thank you for your answers guys , the problem is that I really can not model anything in 3D , I need only the body of this car, the cockpit, I have already , so it ' that 's why I can not rely on models 3d find on the internet . I need an existing model, because this car has a different bodykit compared to others nissan silvia .

Oh , I thought some people had managed to extract 3D models of gt5 / GT6 ?

Anyway it does not matter , in your opinion is what it is at least possible to extract it from GT4 ?

thanks you in advance

No its not, ALL of the Gran Tourismo games are near impossible to extract from. You might as well try looking for a complete model of the car you want from another place other than GT games. you will not get the models from them.  
There are literally thousands of websites that have car models on them (some illegally ripped, some 100% legal to buy)  so your chances of finding those cars is pretty high.  You just have to look more. but forget having anything from the GT games, its not going to happen, sorry.
