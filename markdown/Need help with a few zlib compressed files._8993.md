- Post Title: Need help with a few zlib compressed files.

I have a few files I need BMS scripts for, unfortunately im not too good with coding.

The files belong to a game called UCGO, mainly I need to edit these because there is additions I plan on adding to the game but mainly because I had made an English version of the game and with future patches I plan on translating the tabs "some of them unfortunately happen to be pictures.

The file types are
.sgt, a music file built from other files.
.rsr, sound effect file. I suspect that this is really a .WAV file in disguise. 
.rss, after effects file that controls render states and the way some things are transformed.
.dds, texture file.

Help would be greatly appreciated and would guarantee a fully English patch for the community im part of, if you are able to help me you would have my full gratitude.

Hi,
You can use [Luigi's offzip](http://aluigi.org/mytoolz/offzip.zip) for that files.

And please, remove that link, it's against the new forum rules

oh thank you very much. I didn't read the new rules ill make sure to overview them. Im guessing trading of files should be private from now on? Because im 100% sure I wont be able to make a script for this, although I am seeing some resources on how to do it its still so very hard for me at the moment.

*EDIT* HAHA I looked up a zlib tutorial on this forum and figured out how to unpack all the files myself. I love this website.
