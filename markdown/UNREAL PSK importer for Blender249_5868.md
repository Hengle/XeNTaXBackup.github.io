How do you fix exported Noesis psk files to map to the correct textures?

I exported some files using Noesis and check these in hex editor .There are nothing about names of textures ,
and Noesis don't create .mat file, which is using for reading textures, so ...i can not fix script. 
Most of games based on Unreal Engine after unpacking using Gildor's umodel, create folder with materials ,
which are reading by script .
Noesis - do not. So images must be manual imported.

This is wrong. Noesis exports PSK materials with pskMaterial_t structures. (MATT0000 chunks)

Szkaradek123,

Your work with blender is fantastic!

But please, please consider switching to the new blender 2.56 

I really think it would be a much greater benefit for now and later

Amazing!!! Congratz!!!

To be better than Gildors Max Plugin you need to implement multiple animations.
For example, if a .psa file has 20 animations, your plugin will be able to import only a few of them and separate into strips (NLA Editor).
(For now all animations are replaced into the "armature" strip, so only one animation per model)

Your script is already faster than Gildors one for 3DS max, congratz.

I'll be waiting for further updates, the world should know there are a good psk/psa importer for Blender now

PKS format has support for mapping a texture to surface. There is no way to convert UE3 material to a single texture - it has diffuse, bump, opacity etc. ".mat file" is my own extension which allows me to load relatively complex materials similar to UE3 into 3ds Max automatically. For PSK files produced by other tools (not umodel) you usually have to create and assign materials by hands.

They are incomparable  Blender uses Python for scripting, which should be faster than MaxScript. The slowest thing in PSK mesh loading into Max is assignment of weights to vertices, which is done by simulating GUI clicks (ugly way, it looks like MaxScript API were designed by "strange people"). I hope Blender were designed in a better way.
