Yes i found that Image aswell, its the very 1st image in there

I cant believe it! this is the 1ST EVER format I have looked into and INSTANTLY understood, I can even create a Basic JPEG ripper for this, OMG! Im so happy, all the other files ai have had to star at for a bit, well I got MIDI down pretty fast, but I never thought i cud INSTANTLY understnad something in a HEX, tho they are all NORMAL format files, So i guess I shouldnt really be THIS happy about it, but what the hell, Im not as bad as i thought i was   
Erm.. was i by chance going off topic here?
