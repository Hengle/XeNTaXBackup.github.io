- Post Title: Question about the Acclaim SBB file format in Dakar 2

So, I was going through one of my old gamecube discs (Dakar 2: The World's Ultimate Rally) and I was trying to find where the multi boot roms were stored. It looks like they're all included in a file called "GBA.SBB". 
I opened up the file in a text editor & found 13 .bin files that match up with the GBA downloadable files listed in-game:
DAKAR2CREDITS.BIN
PARIS1.BIN 
PARIS2.BIN 
PARIS3.BIN 
ROCK1.BIN 
ROCK2.BIN 
ROCK3.BIN 
DIRT1.BIN 
DIRT2.BIN 
DIRT3.BIN 
SAND1.BIN 
SAND2.BIN 
SAND3.BIN

And here's how they're listed in-game:
Mini Game Setup
Artois
Le Parc
La Petit Ville
Sun Baked
The Canyon Run
Driving On The Edge
Savannah
Muddy River
Mudbath
Sahara
The Dry Heat
Oskar Beach

I was wondering if anyone knows how to open up a SBB file/archive?
