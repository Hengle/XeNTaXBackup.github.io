- Post Title: Which games have various armors & weapons?

I need to find out the names of all the games that have individual armor and weapon models that can be extracted. These are the ones I know of.

Soul Calibur 3 & 4
Dragon Age Origins
Dungeon Siege?

isn't simpler to search the name of each game followed by site:xentax.com on google and then checking the results to know if exist extractors?
example: Soul Calibur 3 site:xentax.com

Hi!

Well can ask you are you planning to design a new game based on the extractions of various arms and weapons of the other games?  

and i think the XenTax itself help you in this matter because it is a game research forum and i agree with Aluigi's idea of finding the extractors have you tried it?
