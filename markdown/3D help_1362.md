Anyone with experience in 3D model files??  I am trying to decipher a game model file.  Any help would be appreciated.

Would this happen to be the models from WM21?  If so, I know that they are a variation of an .x file, but I can't do anything with them yet.

Can you tell me what aspect of the file leads you to this conclusion?  And, yes, it is those models.

From all the .x files I've seen, they look very similar, at least to me they do, especially all the floats they use.

Have you tried to load them with direct x?

If the animation format is cracked I may have to pick up this game.

Hey, I could use some help with 3D formats as well... for the Carnivores games. .car files are for animals and weapons, only some 'triangle' data to be figured out. ([http://machf.tripod.com/Hunt/Carn/car.htm](http://machf.tripod.com/Hunt/Carn/car.htm))
.3df files are for some of the objects in the games, some 'triangles' and 'bones' data to be determined. ([http://machf.tripod.com/Hunt/Carn/3df.htm](http://machf.tripod.com/Hunt/Carn/3df.htm))
.rsc files are resource files for areas, for Carnivores, some header data (main block and sub-block), 'triangles', 'bones', and 'sounds' stuff to be gotten; for Carn2 & IA, header data (both main and sub block), 'triangles', 'bones', sound and water data. ([http://machf.tripod.com/Hunt/Carn/rsc.htm](http://machf.tripod.com/Hunt/Carn/rsc.htm))
.map files are 'pointers' to the .rsc files, I'm not sure of anything needing to be figured out. ([http://machf.tripod.com/Hunt/Carn/map.htm](http://machf.tripod.com/Hunt/Carn/map.htm))

One last place to post this. 

Here is what I have after taking a rough glance.

Model:

header:
19 bytes - Unknown
4 bytes - File Size minus 4 bytes?

0X25 4 bytes - Number of bones
[Skeleton Data]
4 bytes - String Length+1
x bytes - bone name
4 bytes - x coord?
4 bytes - y coord?
4 bytes - z coord?
[/skeleton] - Repeat # Bone Times

4bytes - padding/end of skeleton - 01 00 00 00

4bytes - Number of Surfaces
[Surfaces]
4bytes - String length+1
xbytes - surface name
1bytes - subheader length?
xbytes - subheader/special flags?
4bytes - Number of Verts?
4bytes - padding
xbytes - mesh data
4bytes - number of morph targets
[morph target]
4bytes - String Length+1
xbytes - Morph targer name
4bytes - number of verts
xbytes - morph data
[/morph target] - repeat # morph target times (always include unused morph targets despite # of morph targets?)
[/Sufaces] - repeat # surface times

Thats condensed. "Mesh data" contains what looks like 3 sections (probably - vert, poly/normal, uvw)


Animation:
4 bytes - File Size 

referenceSkeleton.bpc - Listing of various skeleton packages? Related to 19 byte model unknown?
scriptMotionContents.smc - Move naming conventions?
And what do the various montionPak#.pak do?
