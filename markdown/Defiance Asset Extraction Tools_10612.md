- Post Title: Defiance Asset Extraction Tools

These are a set of tools to extract various assets from the Defiance WAD files. 

Check out the README.md for details but most will probably be interested in the texture extractor (tex2png) and the audio extractor (snd2wav). Mesh extraction is coming but I's still a manual process to lookup the textures. As you can see I'm pretty much there I just need to get it automated.   

Thanks for all those who posted this thread since the Beta. The Miles Sounds System stuff was especially helpful.
