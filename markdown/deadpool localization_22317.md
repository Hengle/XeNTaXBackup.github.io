- Post Title: deadpool localization

Hello I want to translate deadpool game in my language. I know the text file is Coalesced.int and I can edit it. but my question is how can i Unpack and pack Startup_int.xxx because the font file is there.

Sample: [https://mega.nz/file/yhYh0IyS#fEMCOjTO4 ... m4MYV_llD0](https://mega.nz/file/yhYh0IyS#fEMCOjTO4i2uHmjcpRhlAXWhJNrY84VK8m4MYV_llD0)

You can't. But you may be able to replace font in hex editor.
For texture2d files you need Gildor's umodel. For SWF files you need Flash Decompiler Trillix, Sothink SWF Decompiler or any other similar tool.

You can see polish translation here for comparsion --> [https://ikskoks.pl/deadpool-the-video-g ... lszczenie/](https://ikskoks.pl/deadpool-the-video-game-spolszczenie/)
