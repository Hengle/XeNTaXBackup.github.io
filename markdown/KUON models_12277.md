- Post Title: KUON models

hello,

I wish ask help for questions on PS2 game Kuon ( [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuon) ) 

I'm tryng to extract models of characters for deviantart work projects but I found that there are Unknown files :

.BND

.OUT

.PSS

.IRX

I presume that models and texture are on .BND and .OUT file, how I can read them ? its possible extract to work on Blender ?

thanx you
