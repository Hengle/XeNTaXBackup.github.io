- Post Title: Dishonored  , Extracting and cooking a tfc. Help.

Hello , I'm making a texture upscale for dishonored([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0kaenW3Oos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0kaenW3Oos)) , but i can only use texmod which as its limitations , i have been researching how to extract and repack tfc files

Found a way to extract the tfc [https://www.reddit.com/user/TheKronoriu](https://www.reddit.com/user/TheKronoriu) ... urce=share   but some of the textures come out corrupted.


And found a guide to cook a tfc , problem is that the tools only work for mass effect 2 and 3.
