- Post Title: Diablo 4 Fenris Extraction

For those who are interested; an updated CASC Explorer that Supports Diablo 4 can be found here:

[https://github.com/WoW-Tools/CASCExplorer/pull/84](https://github.com/WoW-Tools/CASCExplorer/pull/84)
Look at xrobau's comment and link to build.

Diablo 4 textures can be converted using the tool [HERE](https://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?p=192261#p192261).

Just waiting for a tool to convert meshes.

Cheers
