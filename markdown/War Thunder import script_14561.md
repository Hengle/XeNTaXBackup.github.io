- Post Title: War Thunder import script?

So, I noticed that there is a Dagor Engine export script for 3ds, would it be theoretically possible to create an import script?
I have tried using ninjaripper on the wt asset viewer, but so far had no luck getting it to work.

I'm also interested in this game.

I don't even have it anymore, but since you got it, you should upload some files.
More chance someone picks it to do a script.

The export script can be downloaded here:

I have not yet found where the raw model files are kept inside the game, I will keep looking for a sample.

Has anyone made any progress on this? I will literally pay someone to get some kind of converter or importer for war thunder meshes.

I have heard that the format is quite tricky indeed. Do you believe it is possible to reverse-engineer the export script using .dag samples?

To answer this I'd need more information. From your link to the CDK (script?) I saw an exe with a size of 635 MB (which I didn't download).
Is there a working export script? If so then why should it be reverse engineered?

Maybe it's a matter of terms? export script: conversion from obj (or similar) to .dag
importer: conversion from .dag to obj (or other)

The export scripts exports to .dag, yes. I will upload a new sample and the script itself, did not realize downloading the cdk is necessary to get it.

Here is all the scripts, a vehicle in .dag and the same vehicle in .max.

Well, I see, they've hidden the exporter in an exe and dlus.  
Sadly I don't have the time for reverse engineering such. They may have their reasons to keep things secret.

Well this complicates things quite a bit. I am going to try to get models in their ready format instead of .dag.

Okay, this is what I believe to be a model in their processed, game-ready format.
