- Post Title: FFXV

I have a request that if anyone knows anything about porting from this game, (I have bought the game legally on Xbox) if there is any model currently available for Noctis (young or old). I have had success with porting through PC games, but I've never tried console. I think since FFXV support was added to the latest version of Noesis that it should be easy for me to import the mesh and texture files from the game for his model. I have no intention to make illegal content with the game files since it would be impossible to make a redistributable copy of the game with only a single model's mesh and textures... If anyone would like to help out a fellow porter please PM me. 

Also to, please do not post any links directly in the thread to keep the rules   

English is not my native language (it is secondary) so if I made any error in understanding of the topic, please excuse.
