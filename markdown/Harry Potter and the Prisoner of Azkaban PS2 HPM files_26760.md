- Post Title: Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban PS2 HPM files

Hi. So I managed to extract the .pkg files for Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban PS2. I noticed some HPM files extracted which should be the models. Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets PS2 also has hpm files and I found a script for to make them viewable. I took a chance and tried to use the script on the Prisoner of Azkaban models but it didn't work. I attached some of the models. Any help is appreciated.
