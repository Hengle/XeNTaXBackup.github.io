It looks to me like they are scrambled    Correct me if im wrong. Or they could be compressed, but I've never seen any compression method do this to a fiel. There are also parts of code in it too....

It is compressed something along the lines of LZSS. No expert on that type of compression but some here are pretty good with it.
