I've released a Noesis plugin to view textured models and animations for MGS on the PS1.  To view animations you have to select 'Prompt for Motion Archive' in the tool menu. You can get the plugin here;

Textures will auto-apply if the Dar stg_tex dar file is alongside the model, there is no need to extract the dar file. You can use the program below to extract the stage.dir files for the game

I do need some help with the plugin though.


How exactly do I get the textures to auto-apply?

I put the .dar that contains REX's textures in the same place I put the model files, but they don't seem to be applying.

Is that with the PS1 version of the game? This is an example of what my s17a folder looks like, do your files match up? In most cases there shouldn't be anything that you have to move around as everything is grouped by stages (same for all mgs games), generally its only the 'resident' files that have crossover.

I've been trying it with the PC version, so that could be why.

Oh yeah sorry, it won't work with the PC version, it's specifically for the PS1 version of the game. I may support the pc version eventually.

Alright, good to know

I'll see if I can just put the textures in blender then.

I wish this had existed before I did the old method of ripping models, thank you for your hard work
