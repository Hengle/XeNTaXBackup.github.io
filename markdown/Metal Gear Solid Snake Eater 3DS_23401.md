Has anyone looked into this?
I can't seem to find anything using any search engine because 3DS Max also includes the "3DS" keyword so I mostly get hits on 3DS max tools for HD collection and the original PS2 game.
If anyone could help me out, here's a sample:

Thanks so much!

Here's a maxscript. Haven't looked into the texture format, may be a standard 3DS one. Planning to make noesis plugins for all the mgs games eventually.

I believe it might be more worthwhile of everyone's time here if you could suggest looking into the model/texture format for the enhanced PS3 version of MGS3.

My apologies, I must have missed it then. Is there a topic on this then? I cannot seem to find it for some reason.

Ah ok, I must have come across this quite some time ago. Unfortunately if you check the last comment there, you'll see I had some trouble following the guide in that topic. Perhaps you could be of assistance to me then there?

That sounds like it's because wherever you got it from split the psarc files. You will have to merge them. Really you should be getting the files from your own game on your own PS3 where it wouldn't be split like that.

Well I can't really just go out and buy a PS3, buy the game all in the name of running this Maxscript now.
