- Post Title: Ghostbusters PS3 .smb files?

Hello! I'm going on a bit of a Ghostbusters splurge having found new files hidden in the PS3 and Xbox versions of the 2009 Ghostbusters game and was hoping someone might be able to help me out. I've posted about the textures in another board here, but was hoping someone might be able to tell me how I can read/use this model format...

I'm solid with tools for extraction and putting things together, but I'm yet to learn how to use hexedit, so while this is awesome and I'm REALLY grateful for you looking into this, I have no idea what it means!

It's up to you how much efforts you put into learning "what it means".  
You could press the 'tut' button in hex2obj and try out to extract the example model there.

daemon1 made a video tutorial on how to extract Planetside models (subforum Tutorials).

There's dozens of ways to learn extraction of 3D models.
