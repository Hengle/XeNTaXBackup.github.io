- Post Title: Outlast: Miles Upshur's head model, extracted,  need help.

Hello Xentax! I have extracted Miles' head model from Outlast in .obj form. For those of you who don't know, the game is played in first-person, and Miles' model appears to be headless but it has a fully modeled invisible head.
So what I need now is to make a texture for  it. I don't know how to start a texture map from scratch, so I really need someone to UV-unwrap it, or create a basic texture map whichever way you find easiest. I'll use that as a guide to make the actual texture.
The head model consists of two parts, the actual head, and the eyes. The face is completely unrigged, and there's a seam between the lips, with the inside of the mouth fully modeled.
I hope someone can help rig it, as well, but that is not as important to me right now.
I know that all Outlast fans want to see that guy's model whole, and I'm one of them!
Post a reply here if you can and would like to help me, and I'll message you a download link to the head model.
I'd really appreciate any help!

(A problem I can remember is the setting of seams. Sometimes intuition seems to be required.)

> The face is completely unrigged, and there's a seam between the lips, with the inside of the mouth fully modeled.Most people here don't even know what a seam is, I guess. So your request is very unlikely to be fulfilled.
(Though we have a few top 3D experts on Xentax I can't remember any post about successful head rigging here. Search for rigging, then for head in the results - there's 12 finds as of today)

There's probably a head model buried deep in the files fully textured and probably rigged.
