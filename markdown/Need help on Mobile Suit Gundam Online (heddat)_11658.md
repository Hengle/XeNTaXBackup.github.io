- Post Title: Need help on Mobile Suit Gundam Online (hed/dat)

This is a Japanese PVP MMO. [http://msgo.bandainamco-ol.jp/](http://msgo.bandainamco-ol.jp/)





The archives type are hed/dat. The same as AI Sp@ce which luigi had found the key already.
The other games use the same format are: 
[MS Gundam Online](http://msgo.bandainamco-ol.jp/) Installer: bno_starter.exe
[Wizardry_Online](https://www.wizardrythegame.com/home) [Japanese Version](http://www.wizardry-online.jp/) Installer: WIZ_setup.exe
Pandora Online (closed)
AI Sp@ce (closed)

I had included all these game's resources(and installer) in my sky drive [http://1drv.ms/1xsNvg9](http://1drv.ms/1xsNvg9)
Can anyone help to unpack the archives, please.

Thanks in advance.
