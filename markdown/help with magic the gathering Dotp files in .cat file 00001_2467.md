well just looking at the name and the way they are setup I will guess TIFF files :p

0001.tif
0508c.tif

They are of course headerless and may contain multiple images if they are, but I could see the similarities.

If you manage to open these files within a HEX editor. You can clearly see the first long being a version number or something value 1  in all of the files you sent me.
Then also a Long of 156, also in all of the files.

And then the filename with a null terminated string, and you can clearly see the extention ending with .tif, hence being it a Tiff file. 

Files are missing the IFF*, so a general image player wouldnt be able to display it, because it can't read the header.

I dont know much about this at the moment, gonna check it out.

Here is the demo link of the game please help thank you ...[DEMO](http://www.fileplanet.com/11489/download/Magic:-The-Gathering)
the files were that i upload were extracted from medart.cat
file 00001 is extracted files from medart.cat were viewed from Hex Workshop and a character that is an .tiff was shown on the corner of the Hex workshop viewer. like Mr Matsy and Silver said.

i have a few question 

If file 00001 is an archive?
Does file 00001 is a compressed file that contains the .tiff files?
What is the possible way i could do to make the .tiff to be extracted from file 00001?
Or is there a way i could make the file be be viewed in its true format?
Is the a way i could convert it to jpg bmp pcx?


thank you sorry and for my english
