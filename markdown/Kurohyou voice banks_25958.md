How do you extract stuff from the voice banks of Kurohyou (Kurohyou 2 in specific)? It has a SXGD compression.

Here is an example of one for a character called Dogeza. I know it's possible because I've seen it done by someone with Tatsuya's voicelines

I figured it out. Just add .sgd after the file name and then foobar2000 can open it.
