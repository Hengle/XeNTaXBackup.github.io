Run the PakBuild.exe, Chose file/new

Browse to C:\Program Files\HD Publishing\Joint Task Force directory (one that contains the *.pak files). Press the â€¦ button and change the output path to the new folder on your desktop and on the left side of the menu select jtf.pak and press the New PAK file button, then press the Add>> button, then from the menu chose PAK/Buildâ€¦

Yes, so, this part is then the compressed tail.

Uncompressed size would have to be 621553 bytes.

Hi, me yet again 
I downloaded the demo and had a look at the files. The directory is Huffman compressed. I've located the decompression code in the exe, so it's again probably just a matter of time.

Could this be a trial for a Rahly's PM MexCom plugin?

Yes, I'll try to make this one as a plugin.
I had a quick peek at the Delphi units, seems not too hard.
Maybe I'll also write plugins for the other archives I made explorers for (Titan Quest, Secret Files Tunguska etc.)
