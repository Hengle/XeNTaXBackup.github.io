- Post Title: Extract Unityweb from SFGAME

Heey, is it possible to extract .unityweb from SFGame? I'm super curious about it. 

[https://cdn.playa-games.com/res/sfgame3 ... e.unityweb](https://cdn.playa-games.com/res/sfgame3/Build/6d4ace5e3571693b857137e1278047ce.unityweb)

I have no idea how to do it.

AssetStudio will do the job just fine.
