- Post Title: Tom Clancy's EndWar PC - SB0 + LS0 Files

Hey all, I was just wondering how I open up these SB0 and LS0 files on this game called Tom Clancy's EndWar for the PC. I went into the content folder, found "audio" and there are loads of these files which I would really like to open, but have no idea how to.

Could somebody give me some help with this? Thanks

 Jin

Have you tried decubisnd from Zench's post? After all, it's a Ubisoft game, maybe it works.

Well, if it decodes the files correctly, I wouldn't bother so much about the prog crashing, even if it's a bit annoying. After all it was Zench who wrote it, so I guess we rather be thankful he actually programmed it.
