That bigfile uses a custom graphic format (very simmilar to TM2, yeah) that has the "GIM" signature; but it´s different than GIM´s from PS3/PSP so you wont find any tool to view them. In order to decode, note that the header (after the signatures), includes the ressolution, then it comes the pixel datam then a 0x10 tag and last the color palette (All the examples i´ve seen are BGRA-8bit-indexed).

I havent decode any of them, so I cant really tell if they are swizzled or not, but it´s not an impossible task
