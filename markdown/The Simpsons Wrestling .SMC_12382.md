I want the models from this game, but I can't find anything to convert them. The game uses SMC as its model format.

Is there any way I can use hex2obj on these? They don't have any clear scrambled alphabets, making it hard to find where to begin.

Hmm... can you try a character model please? Seeing the inputs for one will help.

nope, sry. I usually don't waste more than 15 minutes on formats/models I'm not interested in.

I think I'm starting to get the hang of this, but I need a prompt. How do I find the face indices here?

that's not a 15 minutes job and I'm too busy currently.

You might try 0x55D0 as a FIs' starting address (it doesn't give better results but your's is not the best choice, imho, the pic may explain, why).

The vertices count seems to be 385 here but at 0x5790 we'd have an index then that breaks the rules.
