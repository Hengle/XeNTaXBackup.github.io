- Post Title: Sherlock Holmes *.tex files XBOX360

Hi,

Could someone help me?
I need a tool for tex files of Sherlock Holmes - Jack the ripper X360 game.
Tex to dds or png or jpg
and after modify, reconvert back to tex.

Sample tex files are here:

Thank you

You can use NFS Shift Xtx to Tga to convert .tex to .tga. Then use .rdf file which is configured by xtx to tga.exe and Bundler.exe from Xbox 360 xdk to convert .tga to .xpr.

Drag rdf to bundler.exe -> copy texture data from created xpr from offset 0x80c with hex editor and paste it to .tex file (texture data starts from offset 0x34)

NFS Shift Xtx to Tga:

Bundler.exe:
Just google it, I haven't permission to share it.
