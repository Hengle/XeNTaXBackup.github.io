The only thing I can suggest would be to try the Game Audio Player (do a google search for it) - i know it can handle a lot of the EA formats, including some FIFA games.

I don't think anyone is able to play these sounds yet 

Take a look at some of the programs for Simcity 4 - I know that game has a pretty large mod community and I know that the game has these files in it - however, as mentioned, I don't think they can be player or anything. I think the Simcity4 modding is done at [http://www.simtropolis.com](http://www.simtropolis.com) or something like that.

Good luck. I'm afraid I won't be able to help with the sound file because I have never looked at a sound file before and I have no idea how they work :S

hi, i found the sx convertor, it works with all audio files (i think), and works with mus, exa, etc...

The .mus files normally are a pack of audio files (multiple audio compressed in a big file).

You have a differents ways to extract it:

1-Extractor 2.4, it works with .mus
2-.This tools (attached)

"Play" with the audio conversor it really good.

Enjoy
