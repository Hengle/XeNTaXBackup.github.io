- Post Title: VOX ADPCM(?) files demuxed from mobiclip file

Hello,

maybe anyone can help me with some audio files from Wii game? First, media files on game disc are in the mobiclip format. I already demux them to audio with last version of vgmtoolbox r1007 (with improved mobiclip support) and then I receive file which I can't normally play or convert to wav. I upload 2 files (with "add header" option and without, it's a checkbox in vgmtoolbox streams demux page). Maybe anyone can look to these files and explain me how to convert them to wav format?

P.S. I tried to load them into Audacity as raw VOX ADPCM files and I hear something look like real sound through big distortions.

Thanks!
