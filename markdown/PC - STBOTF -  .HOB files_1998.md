- Post Title: PC - ST:BOTF -  .HOB files

Hello.

Saw you did some work on snd files but how about hob files.  Hob files are packed files containing the model for the ships.  The textures are seperate and are gif files which we all know.

I have posted an attachment of the cardassian ship .hob file.

If u need the seperate .gif texture for the ship let me know.

Import and exporter would be good to make adding new ships ingame easier.

Don't mean to be a annoyance but was just woundering if mr mouse or the gang has had a look and could comment if it is doable at all?

If you need the actual game to study the files more, then you can download the iso (legally i presume) at the main botf fan site.  Not that i downloaded the iso as i have original but its there for others due to you cant buy it anywhere anymore.

Pm me if you need the link.  If you think it is not legal then nvm the link.  But it is over 10 years old.  And the game is not produced any more and source code has been lost according to enquires by jigalypuff.

I'm sorry for the delays, just too much going on in the development of MexCom and related issues. When the new version is out, I'm going to be back in full.

No problem dude. 

Botf site is here btw.  For mods and stuff.  ISO is there but u need to register to get it. But you can look at the forums and stuff for info if needed.

Here is a tutorial on how to convert files to hob as you can see its a long process and im hoping somehow we can do it much quicker and simpler using your program mr mouse.

As you can see to make hob files for botf models you need multigen creator.
