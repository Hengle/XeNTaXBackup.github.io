- Post Title: Dragon Age Origins/Dragon Age II- Textures and models

Hi,

I work with XNA Lara and the Blender, but I miss models and textures from Dragon Age and Dragon Age II.

I have found models and textures made by Sir Croft in the Internet, unfortunately I cannot find the textures he used.

Maybe you know, in which erf file there are textures and of faces, brows and hair of Alistair, Cullen, Avelina. Wassley model and the other NPCs?

I have found mor files, but I cannot open them.

Do you know how to open msh from Dragon Age 1? Since I can not open. Mhh works, but not msh files. Do you have another script?

Please, help me. You're my only hope.
