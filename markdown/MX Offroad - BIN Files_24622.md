- Post Title: MX Offroad - BIN Files

MX Offroad is an IOS/Android game, I downloaded the APK of the game and the "assets" folder is all in "BIN"

Does anyone know any way to convert BIN Files (Binary files) to image files?  I'm trying to convert this file that is named "rider_01.mtl.bin"

I'm trying to get this converted to an image file, I'm using a software called "UltraEdit" I can view it in binary but exactly how to view this in an image file is what I'm confused about, any help or guide in the right direction would be appreciated.

Thank you
