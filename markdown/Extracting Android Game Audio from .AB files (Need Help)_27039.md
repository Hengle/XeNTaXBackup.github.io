- Post Title: Extracting Android Game Audio from .AB files (Need Help)

In summary, im about to tear my hair out. Trying for hours now to extract the audio out of these .ab files. I downloaded .apk, converted it to .obb. The .obb renamed to zip. Extracted that. Found the folders labeled in "Sound." Now this next step, no matter what I download from online, use, nothing is doing anything. I have 0 knowledge of CMD usage and the brief threads online discussing it make no sense and aren't helpful at all. I'll attach a picture for reference to start.

Thanks for anyone's assistance!

What you're showing on the screenshot is regular UnityFS bundle file [http://wiki.xentax.com/index.php/Unity_Unity3d_UnityFS](http://wiki.xentax.com/index.php/Unity_Unity3d_UnityFS)

You can use some tools from the list [http://wiki.xentax.com/index.php/List_of_Unity_Tools](http://wiki.xentax.com/index.php/List_of_Unity_Tools)
to open those files (but only if archives are not encrypted).

For example you can use AssetStudio or UABEA.

As for CMD usage, it's easy to learn this from many tutorials online,
just google it [https://www.google.com/search?client=fi ... md+program](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-d&q=how+to+use+cmd+program)

So they can be encrypted. You can upload some samples to some hosting site like mega.nz, google drive etc and share a public link here, then maybe someone will be able to help you.

Also you need to tell us the name of the game.
