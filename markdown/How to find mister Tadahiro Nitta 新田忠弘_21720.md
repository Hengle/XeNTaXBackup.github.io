Hi all! 

We are trying to get into contact with Mr. 新田忠弘 (Tadahiro Nitta). He is a famous composer of game music back in the 80's, 90's and 00's. 

Should you know the Japanese ways on the internet or other to reach him, please let us know here. We'd love to have an interview with him! 

Thanks so much ! Please post any idea here!

24 years later and we still can't find Inezh from Resident Evil 1. finding this guy will be hard, I guess.

I know that probably this has been looked at initially, but, a simple FAX can be sent with an invitation to the main number, and the person delegated to deal with that number, will surely contact him if the invitation is nicely presented by whom ever wants to send it from xentax, just saying, it never hurts to try.

PS: assuming that's the correct website of course

Yes, it would be, but I thought the website might be no longer updated.

I think Mister Nitta speaks only japanese. Did you wrote to him in japanese? Tell me if you need help translating.

Well, I used Google Translate (and also told him that) to translate my English text into Japanese. Of course, I have no way of checking if it is ok or not, or that he simply isn't interested in talking to some stranger and his old computer game music days.

I'd definitely suggest taking MilesPrower up on their offer to translate a message for you; English and Japanese are from completely different language families, and automatic translation isn't up to the task of translating between them yet (though it is getting better).
