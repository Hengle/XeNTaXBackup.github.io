- Post Title: Forum Newsposter at our main page? Get two games!

Looking for a newsposter to do these updates of the Forum news. Who wants the job? Sure, it's voluntary, and let's do this for three months first, to see if it is okay, but it'll earn you two games of your choice to be picked from Steam or GOG, one in the first and last month (of the three). 

Which updates I mean? Well these : [http://www.xentax.com/?p=804](http://www.xentax.com/?p=804)

Let us know here!

If I understand, It's the weekly updates right? just a general overview of that week's posts and events on the forums.

Hey there 

Pepper : I think you're right, this is news by week (week 34, week 35, week 36)
I am not interested in, sorry, I don't have the time and a vocabulary enough expended (I'm french)
Anyway, thank you

Devilot was first to apply, so he is on the job. Perhaps if all goes well, we can expand the crew
