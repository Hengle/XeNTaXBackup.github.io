I can't say much for index/vertex/uv start positions. I just scroll down in hex editor and look for what might be index/vertex buffer. They were easy to spot in this sample. There might be offsets inside the file pointing to these data, and you would ideally find the data based on that, if you are going for a proper tool/script.

For the block size (FVFsize) you can usually look for a recurring pattern in the vertex buffer, if there is any. You can see that "FF 00 00 00" appears every 32 bytes, so I concluded FVFSize is 32.
