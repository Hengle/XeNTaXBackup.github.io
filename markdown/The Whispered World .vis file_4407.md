I'll appreciate any help to extract the "*.vis"-archive from the "The Whispered World" game.  
The visionaire.bms does not works.

I have more files to "examine" like the movies (theora) , graphics (png)  and audios (ogg vorbis) but the files looks a bit crypted and unabled to extract.

Movies [video.vv000 - 11.49MB](http://www.zshare.net/download/78570844ed5d5449/)
Graphics and audios: [scene.vs018 - 4.66MB](http://www.zshare.net/download/785709494761cfad/) and [character.vc016 - 5.53MB](http://www.zshare.net/download/785709739237b8fc/)

Thanks!
