Hi everyone. I made some changes to files present in a .XAF archive in order to test some modifications, the problem is that I'm not able to recompress it in the same format. Also I can't use the program QuickBMS to replace the edited files because their size exceeds the original. 


This is the script which I have used to extract it (Expired):

This is the folder which I need to rebuild (Expired):
