- Post Title: Is there any way to increase NFS Underground's sample rate?

Hello!

I'm trying to import some audio tracks into NFS Underground and I can see it resamples any track I give it down to 22 kHz.
Is there any known way to increase that sample rate to, say, 40 kHz?
I know it's the game that does the resampling, not the tool, because I checked the .ast file inside the game and the .asf inside was at the sample rate it's supposed to be.

Thanks!

I was trying to do the same, but unsuccessfully
