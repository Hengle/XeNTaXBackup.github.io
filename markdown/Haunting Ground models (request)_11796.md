- Post Title: Haunting Ground models (request)

I really don't know if it's been already requested, but I'm really desperate for those.
I've managed to extract the "data.cvm" file from the game, it contains some adx, tex, dp, ph and many other files.
I was told that characters models are either in pck format or in "modules" folder as irx format.
Sadly, I didn't manage to find a properly working extractor for the irx format and every other failed with pck.
PLEASE, help. I can provide any files you want.
Just please, if you know anything about extracting them, don't hesitate, I need every possible information.
Thanks for taking your time and reading.
