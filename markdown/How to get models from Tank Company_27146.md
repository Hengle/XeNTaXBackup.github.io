- Post Title: How to get models from Tank Company?

Hi all! I would like to somehow get models of tanks, maps and buildings from the game Tank Company, they have a .mpk format and I have no idea what it is, how to open it and edit it. All I know is that NetEase uses the messiah engine. Maybe someone is aware of this? I will be grateful.
