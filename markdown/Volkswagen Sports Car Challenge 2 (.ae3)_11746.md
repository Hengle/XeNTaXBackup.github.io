I'll convert more models.
I'm attracted to some cars like Lamborghini Huracan available in Sports Car Challenge 2.
Thus, I've download SCC2 on iTunes and searched for 3d models files and archives.

As a result, I found the archive named "vw_scc2_assets.ae3" in "3D\asset" directory, however I can do nothing for dealing with this archive.
"vw_scc2_assets.ae3" may contain the 3D car models available for this game.

If it's the Huracan you want, you'll find it here: [http://drivemyhuracan.lamborghini.com/](http://drivemyhuracan.lamborghini.com/)

It's unity and you can import it with my script [viewtopic.php?f=16&t=11095](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=11095)

Not only Huracan but also Boxter S, Continental GT V8, and 911 Turbo.
I think that models in Sports Car Challenge 2 are low-poly and high-quality 3D models (include interior).
I hope I can extract it.
