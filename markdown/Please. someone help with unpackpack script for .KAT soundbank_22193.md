- Post Title: Please. someone help with unpack/pack script for .KAT soundbank

Hi guys, I need help with this container. This is from the MDK2 Dreamcst game, the same containers in MK Gold, THPS, RUSH 2049. Could anyone have written a QuickBMS script for unpacking / packing. The beginning of the offsets of sounds, their frequency and ADPCM / RAW format are registered in the container. Yes, there’s a mix sondbank))) Please))) I’m too lazy to manually insert sounds at the addresses, there are under 100 of them in one container.

Here example of container
