I have extracted content of Mario Kart Arcade GP for Triforce which is based on GameCube hardware and managed to convert dsp to mp3, but that's not all, some remaining music are maybe in dat format

Does anyone know about .dat format GameCube/Triforce? I could not find any infomation about it

tpl files are textures as explained here [http://wiki.tockdom.com/wiki/TPL_(File_Format)](http://wiki.tockdom.com/wiki/TPL_%28File_Format%29)
