- Post Title: I can't extract some audio from Cyberpunk 2077

Hi everyone.

I come to you on this forum because I'm really desperate at this point.
Has been 3 goddamn hours that I'm trying to rip some car sounds from CP2077 for a personal project. I managed (somehow) to unpack the massive audio files archieve and located the files I need which are in .bnk format; At this point, I tried using Wwise Extractor to extract the sounds, and I always get this error: 

Parse error: Missing RIFF

Searched for like half an hour, nothing. I came to a weird tutorial which is using bnkextr.exe, ww2ogg.exe and revorb.exe, and I saw this method worked with almost any game.

Same.
Goddamn.
Error.

I passed the next 2 hours looking online, couldn't find literally anything: dead chats, dead forums, people replying only with "same, same, same", people keep saying to use ww2ogg and stuff like that... 

At this point I don't have any chances, does at least someone know what the hell is going on? Please...

It's probably best to upload a sample of one of the BNK files.

I can't upload anything, the website gives me errors everywhere: either wrong format or file too large if I pack it into a .rar

Just use any file hosting site - Mega, DropBox, etc.

Oh, right. Here's the link to the file:

Well, I've had a look and couldn't find anything that would play it properly.  Using a variety of IMA codecs, I could hear some garbled engine sounds, but nowhere near playable.  Unfortunately, it appears to be some new variation of Wwise format so vgmstream won't play it.  Existing tools won't work either, but I guess the vgmstream experts are working on it, so hopefully it might be playable soon.

First of all, I wish to thank you for trying to check it. 
Did you manage to find also other sounds except the engines? Like horns or chimes or anything? In any case, guess I will have to wait until they will get eventually playable...

No, I could only hear some very crackly engine noises, but a lot of it's too noisy to make out anything specific.
