- Post Title: Weird texture format found on Resident Evil (PSX)

Hey there, I've tried to open this stuff with various TIM and RAW viewers, but they can't open this file. Can you guys find out how to decode it? If you ask me, it could be one of the two formats mentioned before, but encrypted or compressed or whatever.

If you open the file in a hexadecimal editor, you'll see a huge number of very low values (1-8 most of the time). Definitely, I don't think it's a picture, there are not enough 'infos' in this file to store a picture.

However I think it may be related to ending staff scrolltext, maybe time, pause, text position, text scroll speed, etc...

Update:
Replaced 'text' by 'hexadecimal' for editor type, of course .

If it was a texture, could it be of 4bit/8bit?
