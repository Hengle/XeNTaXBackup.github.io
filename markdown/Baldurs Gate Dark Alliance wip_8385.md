- Post Title: Baldurs Gate Dark Alliance wip

Just a quick update if anyone is interested. I've been continuing to reverse the files in the snow-blind engine games - in particular the original Dark Alliance from the PS2. At this stage, it's only really interesting for developers who may want to look at the source - I put up a quick screen-shot though for the lovers of eye-candy. It's all GPL-3 open source.

I like how the VIF commands are handled.
Well-structured parser.
