I found some files with extension .upk in the game: Section 8.

There are also some different games has this file format, but I didn't find any way to unpack those files.

I had uploaded two .upk files, hope somebody can help me.

Thanks!

im looking on how to get these files into 3dmax.

the model viewer is good but there a small problem in the fact that all it dose is lets u view & not save as obj...any ideas  

also, how the hell would you change the texture into a jpeg or something if its in the same format???
