- Post Title: SBK Generations Bike .BIN File

So i got SBK Generations for PC and used aluigi's Milestone MIX Extractor to extract .MIX files out of the game. Now i'm confused on how we can import bike models. After Extraction, bike model is in .BIN format (with .RES file too).
So how can we extract models out of it or import it into programs like ZModeler or 3DSMax?
Or is there an existing filter/plugin for the bike file?

Here's a MAXScript that vagos21 and I created a long time ago: [viewtopic.php?f=16&t=11095&p=91256&hili ... one#p91256](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=11095&p=91256&hilit=milestone#p91256)
It works with SBK2011, SBK Generatins, MUD, WRC3 and Superstars V8 Next Challenge

Oh suuure...
Because it's much easier to blindly search for data chunks in dozens of meshes per bike, each with a different vertex structure, and then try figure out how to apply textures and "guess" object transformations.
Yes, much easier than using a script that does everything automatically...

My tool is far from the abilities of a decent script.
Also my post was intended for people who don't owe max, not to offend you in any way.
