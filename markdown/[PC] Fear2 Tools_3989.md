Does the SND extractor extract the sounds with filenames?

Sure it extract sounds with filenames, but I guess that your sentence is missing word "original" or "correct" before word "filenames", and if, then no, it still doesn't know how to obtain a correct filename from directory tree.

But hey, source codes included, you may check it out and maybe you'll find how to do that, because I have no time for that

For example... can I by using these tools for the fear2 get all neccessary data to edit game text? ...To get in game symbols for my native language and edited subtitles?

If it is so, that is for me

Nope, its not a watches with fountain, so it only extracts archives, convert textures and sounds, but there is no archive rebuilding, (.arch01, .bndl) so even you edit some text files, you won't be able to get them back into game... but hey, source codes are included, so you can make a injector or rebuilder. I could help you before, but I have no time for this, sorry and happy new year

These tools can now be posted at the tools blog. [blog](http://forum.xentax.com/blog) We all have editor rights there. So these tools forums can close.

I see, and I'm surprised that its just only WordPress, because I was hoping for something more "homemade" 

Why using wordpress? Why not just make a one simple form with all required inputs (name, category, author, etc) and allow user to easily fill them, without need to copy and paste post template all the time.

Plus you can't do anything with this wordpress posts, is just solid texts, but if you create table in xentax database, for tools only, you will be able to do miracles with them, because you save that form into database as variables, this allows you to advanced applications, sorting, searching, updating, checking.... blablabla.

Anyway, its better than nothing 

I could make this form and some php script to save it to database, then some page for viewing it, to show you how it might look like, but its up to you 

I know that I was talking about this before, but I had no time, you know that, but now I have some free time to try this :O)

I had to be pragmatic. I did not have time to build it myself, and it seems no-one else did as well. If you feel up to it, please do create something more dedicated to the task. The layout can be the same, and it should use phpbb 3.0.0's user database, with admin's and moderators have rights to modify anything and delete anything.

Oh, so you did that by yourself? I thought that there was at least one guy who is working on it... no surprise, I had no time too, sorry 

Anyway, I've started to working on that already, and I'll contact you after its in beta stage.

See you later, have a nice day 

PS: I think that you can still use that blog, letting users to write own articles about games and other stuff, so it wasn't a waste of time

Maybe we should discuss few things a little bit, because I want to be sure that it will be useful at the end.

Here is posting form I've made today (not working yet):
(deleted)

What do you think? is that okay? tomorrow I'll create tables at my server and I'll add some scripts and then I'll integrate that into some webpage template, but before that I want to know your opinion and ideas

Okay, that looks cool already!

I would like an upload button, as users may upload their tools. Alternatively, they could provide a link somewhere else, but primarily they should upload. 

The games. The users should be able to select a Game from a dropdown-box. So they should first check if that game is already in the list, and if not have a text box available to input the new game. Making sense? This way we can guarantee that we have the same nomenclature for Game names and not like : Quake 1, Qauke 1, Quaak 1, Quake I, Quake1 etc.

[EDIT] The type of tool should also be from the drop down box. There should be a category 'General'  instead of a game as well. It could be a general texture editor, for instance, not related to a specific game.

Hi, sure there is some "invisible" progress, I've made a tables in database and now I'm editing a one website template for this tool database, so it may take some time before I can show something usable  don't worry, I'm still here and I'm still working on it...

...so after I make something betaish, I'll let you know....

Okay, but can you give me any estimate of time that you think you'll need? Problem is it would be silly to go through the threads and upload tools in the blog as it is now when there might be a replacement soon.

Sorry I had a tough week, school from 7 am to 4 pm, a lot of homeworks, plus I'm preparing for a math exam... so I had not time to look at that. Tomorrow I'll continue working on that, and I should be able to "finish" it over this weekend, at worst it will be finished at end of next week.

PS: Why nobody else post at that tools blog?:) I see only yours posts...

You tell me, perhaps they don't realize they can actually post themselves, or they can't be bothered: your easy to fill in form may help them cross the line

I guess not. hehe.    Ok, I will proceed and use the blog as we have it now. I was waiting for an alternative, but it's okay. We now have had four people who wanted to create the tools page, but could not complete it for various reasons.

You guess is right, because atm I don't have much free time, so I can't work on it right now.... but I will continue asap. Have you looked at that website? I've made a website for that tools database, but you can't see how much job is done inside, at server side  a lot of php scripts are already written, I just need to complete it, so I won't abandon it, I want it finished....

Because the MegaUpload site just got busted and taken down recently, could someone re-upload the fear 2 tools somewhere else?  A suggestion: [http://www.4shared.com/](http://www.4shared.com/)
