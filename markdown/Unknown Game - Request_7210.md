Ask your friend what game it is?

Some people can figure out a format just by looking at a single sample, but others probably not. There may already be tools or info, but we wouldn't know since there's no title.

For example, I just googled dts and got this: [http://www.garagegames.com/community/fo ... read/48429](http://www.garagegames.com/community/forums/viewthread/48429)

But I wouldn't know whether it's the right one or not.

Well, from what I gathered it is a Torque engine games, and called Metal Drift I think.
