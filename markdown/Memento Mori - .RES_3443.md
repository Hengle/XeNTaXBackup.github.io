- Post Title: Memento Mori - *.RES

Hi, 

i search a good soft for unpack/pack *.res files from game memento mori 

here a example file : [http://superuploader.net/fb9f64499478-M ... d-res.html](http://superuploader.net/fb9f64499478-MEMENTO-DEMO-texture2d-res.html)

I found a soft for unpack, and made some modification, but when i try repack, and relaunching game not works, i use this tools [http://www.xentax.com/uploads/author/it ... ool101.zip](http://www.xentax.com/uploads/author/itg/CenResTool101.zip) 

Any lucky for a fix of this soft ?

I guess that in this specific case is better if you contact directly the author of that tool so he can update it.
his mail address is on his webpage: [http://int0thegame.blogspot.com](http://int0thegame.blogspot.com)
(yes I have seen your comment in the post on that website but have you tried to contact him via mail too?)

This game no need repack.
Just unpack the .res in the same name folder and del the .res.
The game will read that folder first.

Phew, just got registered here.
Seems i'm little late, but here's a tool to unpack and pack Memento Mori .res files.
It's tested and seems it works well with the English version of the game.
