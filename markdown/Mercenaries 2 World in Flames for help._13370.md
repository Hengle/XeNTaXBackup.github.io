Original language because the file is too large, the file with the extension from within the game if you take a small wad I hope is of use to you.

For exporting the contents of .wad files use Luigi's BMS script  [http://aluigi.altervista.org/bms/mercs2.bms](http://aluigi.altervista.org/bms/mercs2.bms) 

But it can't be used for reimporting.

I don't know. Maybe the game works with unpacked files. (can't test it by myself).

I thank you again. But this tool only files with the extension block. But I need the language files. How do we reach them?
