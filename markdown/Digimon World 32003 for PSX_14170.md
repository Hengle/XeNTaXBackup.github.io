- Post Title: Digimon World 3/2003 for PSX

Hello. I have been using a rom(bin file) for Digimon World 3 and would like to know:

How would I extract 3d models and battle backgrounds from this game? I'm not entirely too sure where to start, being a noob and all.

I used jpsxdec and found videos and the 2d sprites, but I haven't been able to find direct access to the models and battlebacks.

Using Isobuster, I did manage to find a bunch of .bin files within a "DAT" folder within the main bin file. The files were all named after each of the characters. I couldn't access them, however.

Any help would be greatly appreciated.
