- Post Title: Kindly asking for supprt of Nomad Soul (aka Omikron) music.

Hello!

The music of this (underrated) game is great, but strangely no one has been able to rip it (yet). The soundtrack features a few tracks composed David Bowie hismelf, which makes it very interesting, but the other tracks (composed by David Cage) are also great.
I'm desperately looking for a way to rip the music from the .adp files present on the game's discs. I tried Game Audio Player and a few other rippers, I searched the Internet for an answer, but could only find this unanswered question. It seems that no one has find out how to rip these tracks. I can provide some .adp files if someone can offer a FTP or something.

Thanks.

Hmm, I remember looking at this game once, don't know why I haven't supported it yet. 

Is there a demo? Or perhaps could you send us a front and back part of the archive?

We have a tool for that, but I won't be able to give that here, until tonight. (it's 10:00 AM over here).

OK, use this program. 

[http://www.xentax.com/downloads/tools/filecutter.zip](http://www.xentax.com/downloads/tools/filecutter.zip)

Select an archive you wish to cut, then select a name for the file that will contain the front and the back pieces (it will give a suggestion as well). 

Then select the size of each piece (256k, 512k or 1024k). 

Click GO! 

Then you can attach the created file (a zip) here! 

Thanks!  (You should have MultiEx Commander installed though, as the program uses dlls that are installed by MultiEx Commander).

Hehe, ok, so the cutter is only necessary for files that are rather large... Thanks!

I find it hard to post samples on this forum because it is somewhat restrictive on file formats and file sizes. Wouldn't it be easier if I sent it to you via MSN? I can also set up a FTP server on my PC, but it won't be running all night, so you will have to download the files quite fast (lets say within the 3 next hours). 
Tell me wat you think.

I had a look at some of those files, but I couldn't find anything in them that would suggest that they are an archive.

They are not archives. They are the audio files. Each file is a music.

I read a forum where you discussed this problem with others before. January 2004. You opened them as 8-bit ADPCM in Goldwave. Did you try Cool Edit Pro once, to open them ?

No, I didn't. I tried to install Adobe Audition (the successor of Cool Edit) but it it doesn't support Windows 98.
And yes, I tried to open the files with Goldwave as various formats, but the sound was awful (in fact it was quite hard to recognize the music).

The closest I came was when I treated them as Dialogic ADPCM .VOX files (4-bit ADPCM).

Yeah I remember having this same result in April 2004, at the time I first played with these files.
Someone on [this topic](http://www.hydrogenaudio.org/forums/index.php?showtopic=16006&hl=) says that the files should be opened as ADPCM 16-bit Stereo, but I don't know of an audio editor that would be able to open this format.

if somebody would be able to code a program that adds the header information with the right filelength then we could enjoy these great music tracks.

I've made a simple tool for converting in-game sounds to standard WAV files. Just extract attached archive in to your The Nomad Soul\Tracks folder and run .exe file. Make sure you have about 750Mb of free disk space!

Thank you VERY much! I was looking for such a converter for years. I wonder how I didn't read your post earlier. How did you do it?

Ps: could you please provide the source if you still have it? It would make it easier for coders to develop input plugins for Winamp and foobar2000.

if Cutter is still interested to the source code of the adpcm algorithm used in the game I have written an [adp2wav](http://aluigi.org/papers/adp2wav.zip) tool just now.
hope it helps

Sorry for resurrecting an old topic.

Luigi, your tool was only decoding stereo audio. I've added channel detection (byte at 0x00000003 = 1 => stereo; = 0 => mono), so it's able to decode every Omikron .ADP now. The new adp2wav is attached to this post.

I need help with this format though. I need to encode audio in this ADP format. I've tried encoding Yam ADPCM (Codec ID: 0x20), getting the output raw data and adding its custom 16 bytes header, but the result is the sound with a lot of volume issues. Any idea what program and format should I use to make a "compatible" ADPCM with this ADP format?

thanx for the correction.
I guess that for solving your problem you should find the differences between that codec and the adp one, personally I can't help

I wrote an encoder for this ADPCM format, you can see the code [here](http://www.codetrunk.com/fb284c04).

It's actually a pretty dumb algorithm. It tests the 16 possible combinations for each nibble and chooses the one that produces the closest result to the original sample. It uses Luigi's routine for decoding.

The results play fine with both Luigi's decoder and the game.

I'm pretty sure no one will be interested in this program, but I'm posting it here just in case.

That is untrue. Have a binary as well to share?

Binary and code attached to this post.

In [this post](http://snesorama.us/board/blog.php?b=478) there are more information about this ADPCM format if anyone is interested.
