- Post Title: How can I extract/open the .arc/.bin files from MarioParty10

At the first I hope you can read my bad english 
I want to edit the title photo of Mario Party 10. I have discover a file who names title.arc:
C:\Mario Party 10 [ABAP01]\content\common\result\layout\title.arc
Now I have try to extract the arc file but every programm that I have try canÂ´t extract the file. 
Now I have the question how can I open/extract the file respectively how can I edit the title Photo of Mario Party 10

Here is the arc file:

Also I want to edit the texture and model from the characters/enemys. I found it there:

C:\Mario Party 10 [ABAP01]\content\common\bin\ch_base\pc11_rosetta.bin (Here is for example the file from Rosetta)

And here is the .bin file:
