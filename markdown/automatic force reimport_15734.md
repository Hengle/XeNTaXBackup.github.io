- Post Title: automatic force reimport???

I've made some scripts and would like to know if there is a command that I could add via CMD or in the BMS script itself to automatically force reimporting even though there is a size difference and would not type force manually. I know it would over write the next bytes but it only contains a lot of 00.. like 0x300 so it's no problem if it got overwrite.
