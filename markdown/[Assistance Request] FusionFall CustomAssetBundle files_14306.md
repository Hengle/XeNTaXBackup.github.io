- Post Title: [Assistance Request] FusionFall "CustomAssetBundle" files

I'm currently trying to figure out how to properly extract the filesystem trees and contents from these files. Each file is in it's own folder, prefixed with one of the following. (listed in the form of [prefix]{number of folders with prefix}

```
[characterselection]{1}
[chartexture]{1}
[dongresources]{29}
[effects]{1}
[freearea]{1}
[fusound]{1}
[futuremusic]{1}
[futurenano]{1}
[icons]{1}
[lobbymusic]{1}
[npctexture]{1}
[tabledata]{1}
[tutorial]{1}
```

All these folders end with 2eresourceFile. 
Meanwhile, there are also folders prefixed with map, of which there are thirty eight. These end with 2eunity3d and contain two files. These are named "BuildPlayer-Map" and "BuildPlayer-Map.sharedAssets" The .sharedAssets file lists specific CustomAssetBundles to preload from.
[https://goo.gl/GXlv52](https://goo.gl/GXlv52) here's one of each of the folder prefixes for your perusal and examination.
