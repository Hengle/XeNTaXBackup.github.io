- Post Title: Conception Plus: *.std.orb format

Greetings.

I'm currently attempting to rip the models from the PC version of Conception Plus, however I've run into issues doing so.

Knowing that this is similar to Zero Time Dilemma's file format, I tried the [blender 2.49 script](https://zenhax.com/viewtopic.php?t=2700), but the resulting mesh is incomplete and has no weighting.

Any help would be appreciated.

If you expect a perfect solution you'll need to wait for Mariusz Szkaradek123 to patch the script (for ZTD .std) for Conception Plus.

Another approach would be to upload a ZTD .std file so that someone could do some "debugging" to see how the scripts work.
Then hopefully the script could be patched.

Or you could try out hex2obj (view link in my sig):

(first sub mesh only, and: h2o doesn't care for weights)

Thanks, that works well:

Will take some time to understand how this works.
And then even more time to patch the script for Conception Plus, hopefully.

So don't expect results too soon.

edit: got a little bit further with the mesh of h001.std but didn't understand the problem with the indexing.
