I've managed to extract some of the models of the 360 version of this game. Can somebody assist with a viewer/converter to mess with these models? The structure doesnt look too complicated.  Ive attached on of the model files below:

This is a DXT texture, not a model.

Thanks for the reply. 

There's only one directory which has files which appear to be textures and models. I thought this was a model because of "CHR_" naming convention of the files. I'm attaching a directory listing, let me know which are the model files and I'll upload a chunk.
