Ive extracted something from that res file that looked like sprites
of some sort, but im not really sure. 

however, there is no index in this archive, and even worse, there are no
headers of the files either. everything is just stacked ontop of
eachother. but i make a rough guess that the index must be stored
in another file in the game, because without it, the game cannot 
read the RES file anyway.

i would like a fullsize archive of this type to analyze it more =o

nothing is compressed, or encrypted. just raw data.

Yes, some sprites can be in this file. So you need fullsized file? Its more then 1 mb, so i can't add it to attachment. Or may be you need other .res files?
