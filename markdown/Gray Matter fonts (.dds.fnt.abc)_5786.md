- Post Title: Gray Matter fonts (.dds/.fnt/.abc)

I made Japanese translations with own font.

.fnt

```
 fontinfo[256]
   short x,y
   signed char adj1
   byte w
   signed char adj2
   byte dmy // 0

```

adj1,adj2 maybe character spacing, 0 works fine when you make font.

abc is not needed. maybe kerning info.
