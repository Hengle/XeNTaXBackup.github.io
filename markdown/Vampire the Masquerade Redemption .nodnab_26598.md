- Post Title: Vampire the Masquerade Redemption .nod/nab

Vampire the Masquerade Redemption ran on a proprietary engine called NOD that was inspired by Id Tech. It had unique model formats called .nod and .nad that interestingly had a full spec sheet made for both by the original developers.

[https://web.archive.org/web/20190405173 ... cs/NOD.htm](https://web.archive.org/web/20190405173753fw_/https://e-mods.net/nodsdk/Docs/NOD.htm)
[https://web.archive.org/web/20190405173 ... cs/NAD.htm](https://web.archive.org/web/20190405173753fw_/https://e-mods.net/nodsdk/Docs/NAD.htm)

I've also linked some samples of the model/animation files here [https://www.dropbox.com/s/fkgo9k3l81h1s3z/nod.zip?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/fkgo9k3l81h1s3z/nod.zip?dl=0)

Unfortunately the only exporter tools for both were the original developer's Maya plugin and a Milkshape plugin that only supports meshes not animations. It's stunted the modding community a lot since they've wanted a way to export animations since the game came out. 

I'm wondering if I could get some help trying to get a more modern way to export animations for the game's engine? Either Blender or Noesis. As it would greatly benefit the game's modding community and allow for more complex mods to be made. I would also be more than willing to write a tutorial documenting the process for others once created. I would be much appreciated for any support and I thank you for any time you'd be willing to spare.

Update

A friend of mine wrote a Katai script for both NOD/NAD that's reportedly more accurate than the dev specs. He also wrote a preliminary Noesis plugin however it does not do exporting. I'm wondering if anyone could help finish it so it does exporting?

Katai scripts can be loaded here. They're also plaintext files.

Thanks to a very kind member of the Xentax community the .nod Noesis plugin is now completed!

I've also written a tutorial on how to use the plugin here

Unfortunately it doesn't support exporting .nad but we are 1 step closer to the goal of completely rendering Alias Maya 2.5 obsolete. If anyone wants to take a crack at .nad let me know.
