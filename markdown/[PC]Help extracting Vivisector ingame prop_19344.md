- Post Title: [PC]Help extracting Vivisector ingame prop

Hello everyone, 
                       I wish to extract one particular 3d model prop from the game Vivisector the beast within. This game was made by Action Forms in 2005, using an advanced version of the AtmosFear engine, and unfortunately the modding community for games made with this engine are now either dead or inactive. The tools I have used have not yielded any results and I lack the coding know-how to do anything more.

Although It would be wonderful to be able to access the other beautiful, high detailed, low poly model and texture resources from this game, It is this T-rex prop that is what I'm really after, preferably a clean export as an obj files.

I suspect the object file to be either on the level map or on one of the object cmf files that I cannot open to locate this prop.  I have however extracted the texture file for it.

Since a thorough search did not find a corresponding cmf file with the same name as the texture or anything even remotely associative, I'm inclined to say that the model is within the level map files.
