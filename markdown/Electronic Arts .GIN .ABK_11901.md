Hello,everyone! 

I want to extract some engine and turbo sounds from NFS games,so I need your help,guys!
Games like Need for speed Underground 2/Most Wanted/Carbon use .ABK and .GIN files to store sound data.

I am not sure,but I beleive It's an archive format,that stores more than one sound effect
Here are the examples
