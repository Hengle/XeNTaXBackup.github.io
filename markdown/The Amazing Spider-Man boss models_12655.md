- Post Title: The Amazing Spider-Man boss models

Hey everyone! I was hoping someone here might be able to help me -- I'm after the boss models from Amazing Spider-man, but Ninja Ripper won't seem to get them and I can't get 3D Ripper DX to actually work with the game itself. Does anyone know how I might be able to go about obtaining these characters, or even have them themselves?
