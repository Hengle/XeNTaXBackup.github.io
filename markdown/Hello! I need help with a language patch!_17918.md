- Post Title: Hello! I need help with a language patch!

Hi! I am new to this forum, so I will try being brief. 

There is this game (it is a visual novel) in Chinese. I have an acquaintance who is able to do the translation, but we need to extract the files from the "data.org" file of the game. It seems to be encrypted (I have asked several programmers about this) and one of them suggested me this forum.  

I am not very sure about the engine... and its original creator cannot be contacted.  

Here it is the file for you to take a look:

Thank you very much for your attention! I hope you can help us.
