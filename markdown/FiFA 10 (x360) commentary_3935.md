- Post Title: FiFA 10 (x360) commentary

Hi im from Hungary, 
and fifa also includes hungarian commentary but on pc its the same since 07 but a few days ago i have managed to play with fifa 10 on x360 and the commentary was different. So i would like to extract the commentary from this version. 
This is what i have done so far: i opened the fifa iso with xbox backup creator and extracted all the .dat files. I found with FINALBIG the .dat wich contains the commentary speechs, dat5 or something like that. And i also managed to extract the hungarian commentary file...BUT the file extension here is not .dat like in the pc version...its  .sbs and i have found almost nothing about this extension, at least no program could handle this as i know.

Somebody could help? sbs ????
