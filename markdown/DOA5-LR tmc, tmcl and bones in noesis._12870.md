- Post Title: DOA5-LR tmc, tmcl and bones in noesis.

Hey, not sure if what I'm asking is against the rules or not,(I checked the rules and nothing jumped out at me) if it is perhaps a mod could close the topic or something?

I was looking at the DOA models in noesis(latest version) via extract files from pc version of DOA5-LR with "doa5LRarchivarius" which extracts the files. tmc is the mesh file, and tmcl is the compressed texture files. I load them in noesis and though all the textures a correctly aligned, and meshes and texture channels named, I don't see any reference to the bones, or envelopes, in the data viewer?
I was wondering if there is another file that needs to be extracted or something?
I've seen lots of threads about modding this game on xbox and playstation across the internet, but not much about the pc version. I assume that if people have modded the console versions they must have been able to access the bones, and physics?

There's no support for bones in both noesis scripts (360 and pc version) and there's no script supporting vertex weights for pc version. In addition there's no need to open a new thread, you could have asked in the general DOA modding thread.
