- Post Title: Return to Mysterious Island - translation

Hi friends

While translating the game Return to Mysterious Island, I discovered with the help of the HEX editor that the in-game texts are in the JV3.bin file, but I don't want to do HEX editing, the word limit is very annoying.
I found the JV3.bin file in the loc_US_cmn.bf archive.

Is there a tool for this file?

Thanks for the program, but when I translate the txt file it outputs by exceeding the character limit, import is not possible. Since the game is old, it has character limits.

The import file is attached.
