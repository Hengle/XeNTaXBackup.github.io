- Post Title: MMORPG File Format Conversion [PAID JOB]

Hello, I have source code for a certain MMORPG(client and server source, with all graphics libraries etc) and I would like to be able to modify the model/animation files for this MMORPG in .max format. I will provide source files on request, I have a decent knowledge of C++ and should be easy to work with. I would do this myself, but I do not have much knowledge of the 3DS api. If you have knowledge of this and C++, please feel free to contact me.

Payment: I can offer $300+, it is important that it is done quickly though. Payment can be adjusted. 

Please contact inquiry (AT) xor-net.com via email. Thank you.
