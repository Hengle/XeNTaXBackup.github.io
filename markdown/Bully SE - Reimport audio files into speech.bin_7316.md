- Post Title: Bully SE - Reimport audio files into speech.bin

Hey!
I'm a Bully SE modder but there's something that I still didn't figured out. I've extracted the whole speech from Bully and made a few changes. But now I just can't reimport the modded files into Speech.bin. I'm using QuickBMS. Do you know how to reimport the files into the .bin? Thanks in advance.
