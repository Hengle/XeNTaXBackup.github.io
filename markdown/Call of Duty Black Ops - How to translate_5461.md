Sorry for the bump, just wanted to note that translation is now possible.
I made a tiny tool that will take care of the .ff files, it allows for text extraction & injection.

Great tool.
But, I want to translate the game completely.
Is there any other way to translate other texts? (like menu, objectives)
Or, can you update your tool?

Thanks.

Happened to me now, too. Of all the files I tested, I didn't test this one, sorry. I don't know why it happens, let me look into it, there may be an update soon.
Sorry for the inconvenience
P.S. play in windowed mode so you can exit those fatal errors (to avoid freezing which happens in FS mode)

- Post Title: Call of Duty: Black Ops - How to translate?

Well, there's one thing I'm sure about:
en_code_post_gfx.ff is the only file (talking about SP files) which uses this kind of approach. It seems Treyarch has for some reason decided to place static offsets for menu strings, so all strings in that .ff file are invalid if your length differs from the default string length.
In other words, if your text string length is equal to the length of the string extracted from the original en_code_post_gfx.ff, there will be no fatal error. This is only for en_code_post_gfx.ff, all others can work with different lengths!

Only solution that comes to mind is to push back the text that many bytes that your length overruns the default one, but that would interfere with other .ff data. I also have some other ideas I'm currently trying out, maybe I'll succeed in something. I'll keep you posted.

Thanks, Jurko! That helped me in additional researching of the files.

UPDATE RELEASED:
v1.2
Fixes: now should work with the notorious en_code_post_gfx.ff file (or any lang prefix)
NOTE: Injecting your own text into en_code_post_gfx.ff requires that your strings are the same or shorter length than the originals. This is an unfortunate limitation due to the fact menu-text offsets seem to be hardcoded within the game .exe for each specific language. Of course, all other files can have text of any length, you're not limited to anything.

So, there is no way to translate code_post_gfx.ff without char limit?

- Post Title: Re: Call of Duty: Black Ops - How to translate?

I'm afraid so, yes. The offsets are hardcoded and there's just no way to tell the game "read at 0x2c, not 0x2e". So the only thing possible is to have shorter strings or of equal length, which the new version allows (because we can easily pad out the bytes not used by 0xff separators).
However, I have an idea how can we bypass that char limit. We need to find a language which has the longest possible strings. Then, we take a lang_code_post_gfx.ff file from that lang, extract strings from it, and inject all English or whatever strings in there. If all of that language's strings were longer than the English ones, maybe you will have enough space, but this is not really a solution as it depends on what language is the longest.

It also wouldn't be enough just to put in a lang_code_post_gfx.ff - you would also need to change the registry entry 'language' from ENG or whatever to that lang code and rename "localized_lang_x.iwd" files to the appropriate lang code, rename "en_outro.ff" to "lang_outro.ff" and all other .ff files too. Maybe that way you will be able to get a bit longer strings.

Right, it seems most strings are longer so maybe you should use that? Try editing the registry entry, renaming all .ff files to their Spanish lang codes etc and then try to inject some text; there shouldn't be any errors, but you are still limited to the length of the Spanish strings. I'm afraid there's no workaround except modifying the offsets the game has hardcoded somewhere...

Sorry for my bad english.
I compare polish, english and spanish code_post_gfx.
Look on 24 bit. There is "Second size" of .ff file.
I donÂ´t know how to calculate this value.
Only this values are diferent

Ok, I've been fiddling around with the .ff's and there is a way to remove the fatal error!
However, string positions (some of them, not all!) seem to be hardcoded so you'll get text blanks somewhere, probably.
Here's a test version of the injector:

There can be bugs, so please wait until next week when I get full time to explore some other options I have in mind.

Here the game crashes when I translate and use the file: "en_vorkuta.ff".
If I translate the file with same length, the game works.

There will be a MW2 tool next week; the .ff structure is similar, but not identical, I just need to make some modifications.

@Herdell: Yes, I see this happens for all menu-related strings. There is a way around the fatal error, but it seems the string offsets (some of them) are hardcoded, at least for the code_post_gfx.ff. Try downloading from the link above, maybe that will work. If not, report back so I'll try one more thing.

It seems that depends on how many you changed the original strings... I got fatal errors sometimes, but not at other times when changing only a couple of strings, which seems to be the result of the offset hardcoding. I'm sorry, but there is no direct cure to that. I'll try something else, but the hardcoded offsets are something that can't be changed that easily unless we find where they are located, and they're not in any .ff files.

mw2 have deflate encryption algorithm. Without key we cant do anything with fast files.

About cod4/cod5/cod7 fast files. Except main file size (first 4 bytes after zlib decompression) they have "second size" which I didn't know how to calculates (offset 0x18-0x1B). Author of .FFviewer didn't know too. So I didn't see the way to translate game (or fix some localization errors like in our russian version) normaly (without any bugs, unreadeble strings or something else)

MW2 files are easily readable after inflation, already done it: the strings are in the same format as in BO so no problems.
Yes, the 'second size' is weird, but goes up the same as the normal size. For example, if 1 of your strings is by a char longer than the one in the original .ff, the size will increase by 1, but so will the 'second size'. Tried it out, no problems.
The 'second size' is not the problem; the hardcoded offsets for menu strings are.

Font file is in C:\Program Files\Activision\Call of Duty - Black Ops\main\localized_English_iw00.iwd
file.
You can open .iwd with WinRar.
After that, go images, find "gamefonts_pc.iwi", then extract it somewhere.
Then download iwi to dds utility.
That's all I know. I don't know how can you edit it.
