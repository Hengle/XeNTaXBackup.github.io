Forgive my ignorance, but what exactly do you mean by a "munge file"? A quick Google search wasn't particularly enlightening, though it sounds like you're describing an archive file, in which case this is literally the type of job MultiEx Commander and the MexScript scripting language were designed for. =)

Well, a munge file would be a file that holds a bunch of small files inside of it.

In this case I have a munge file of about 300kb that includes about 40 audio files inside.

You said something about MultiEx and MexScript. As you can notice I have the "ultra-noob" rank, meaning I'm new at this forum and my knowledge about these terms or programs is  scarce.

Could you guide me towards a solution to my issue?

Thanks

Yeah, your definition of "munge file" matches "archive file" to a T.

It allows you to extract (and in some cases re-pack) files from archives (or munge files) without needing to write or request a specialized, standalone tool. It does this by way of MexScript, which is an in-house scripting language specifically designed to handle files (most commonly by extracting the contents of archive/munge files).

To make this a bit easier:

What is the name and platform (Windows/Xbox/Playstation) of the game?
Where did you find the files inside the game? (is it in gamename/soundeffects/ or gamename/music)
