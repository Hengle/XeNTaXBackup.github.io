hey red, do you know what dds settings is used, because the uncompressed pac works fine with xpacker, but it won't let me reinject dds with last year setting (dxt1, no alpha, all mip maps)

hey tich, nice you still there.

dxt1, generate mip maps - 4.

always good to save with no mip maps and check the filesize. when it's smaller than the original texture file then save with higher level (1,2,3,4,...).


btw: old models still work, but they have no emotion and you have to disable some normal maps.
maybe good ol 64.bpe helps.

mhm, xpacker can't open ed49.pac. maybe tekk has luck...hope they didn't change it, cause we were able to add images over there last year.

misc.pac - attires start at offset: 00008A00

I know for ed49.pac, but like I said I had an idea some days ago, it's to replaced the ed49 with the one from last year, and it works

What up guys, you dont know how good it feels to see the names of red and tekken!  Great to see not everyone has gone rogue lol. But yea ive been testing out some things myself as well.  Hey red, what is it that needs to be done to last year's model textures to add them to the game?  Ive added a few but they all seem to have some kind of weird looking deformities, like dark spots on their face and body.  I've put together a nice little barrett mod though, beard and new attire. If you guys want me to upload it let me know. Ive been also trying to figure out the video files used this year, they are .bik2 format, and i can't find anything that will recognize or create the file.  If anyone has any idea what they are please let me know.

Edit: Also one more question, isn't there a file i can delete that controls the hair on the models?  Im asking because I wanted to use Taker's wwe 12 model with the hood attire, but i wanted to make it bald.  Is that possible?

Havent had time to look at the flies as yet but the easiest way to get rid of hair is to adjust the alpha values. I posted a tut on my website a long time ago. Check it out.

Hey,

I'm been interested in adding models ever since BrienJ was doing it on SvR 2010 but I dont know how. Can anyone lead me to the right direction on how to add wrestlers in WWE '13?
All i want to add is Demolition & maybe Arn Anderson. I also have a JTAG Xbox 360

Any chance someone can send me there ed49.pac and plist files that for sure work.  I was able to do the hack fine in WWE 12 but for whatever reason I'm not having luck this year.  Even with using the file from 12. That would be very helpful.  Thanks!

[quote="tich] thanks for this bro [/quote]

X-Packer was the key to getting the id's . 

To everyone else, I've added code to X-Packer to read and edit the save files and work with the wrestler info. I can add wrestlers to the game but once again the problem is selecting the wrestlers because they dont appear on the selection menu. (This version of X-Packer is not released as yet)

The only way around this is to add the wrestlers as DLC which I have no idea how to do. If anyone can figure out how the dlc files work , please post the info here. 

There are also issues with adding last years models as there are wierd anomalies on the skin and some dont display correctly. 




To those that are trying to open the models in 3dsm, the model script written by chrrox a few years ago doesnt work as the model format was changed last year. The only solution is a new script.

@Tekken Last time i spoke with draven he said brien was thinking of making his program again to add wrestlers as DLC, ill check again though.  And to the skin problems on the wwe12 models... thats exactly whats been bugging me.  Any idea what it could be?  I was thinking maybe normals? I don't know but since the models actually load and dont freeze the game, that has to be a sign that they can work in wwe13 right?  Hoping someone can figure this out.

Red is the expert when it comes to models. I've noticed that the textures have a lower level of mip maps than previous years (4 mips maps) and the normals are double the size in terms of dimensions. 

I tried creating savages normals and colour textures with the new format but still get the same errors. So I have no idea. Hoping red can figure it out. 

Also the AI on the wwe 12 models dont work, so you need to replace the 64.bpe file with a 64.bpe file from this years game.

Not in the current version. In the new version I'm working on you can by opening your save file in it. Only red and I have this version as I haven't finished coding the functionality to edit your saves as yet.

Not in the current version. In the new version I'm working on you can by opening your save file in it. Only red and I have this version as I haven't finished coding the functionality to edit your saves as yet.

great news, we will be able to fix saves that have been hex edited ?

I don't know but since the models actually load and dont freeze the game, that has to be a sign that they can work in wwe13 right?  Hoping someone can figure this out.

he said two days ago again that he won't make any tools this year 

@tekken oh, didn't know xpacker can do that, how you can see the id list ?

xhp Creations facebook, brienj has made a trainer for this game 
I spoke to brienj last year and he told me it wouldnt be hard to make his dlc maker from 2011 work in wwe12, So I will be asking him about the dlc maker "if" he will do it or how someone else can go about it..

Oh tekken look @ this

From BRIENJ!! What did it take? If it's easy, then I can begin working on adding DLC to the game. I didn't want to add last year's models until the texture problem was taken care of.


And Chavo!!

Hi Tich, red, Plodtrew and all the guys 
You really made me enjoy all my past Wrestling games!

I have a problem this year :
I still can't reinject dds texture with Xpacker. It keeps telling me that the injected file must have the same size...
DDS file with mipmaps are too big and without them.... too small.

I used Red Bat file to uncompress all the Pac files (Thank a lot!!)
Then I did as I usually did with previous games and it doesn't work.

Tich, how did you make it work?
It seems that you succeeded in editing WWE13 texture file.

Please.....

I succeeded in reinjecting the texture file in Xpacker using Photoshop to generate the mip maps so I could have the same file size.
I did the test with Faarooq (putting a red X on his chest)

The game loaded just fine and he had the red X on his entrance. 
But after the entrances, when the match is supposed to start.....  black out. Nothing. Just a pitch black screen.
I think that it is because of the mip maps setting. Maybe the game is trying to olad them.....

Any feedback on this?

Ok, but I had my share of texture modding myself and I'm pretty sure that those are the settings I used (couldn't have got the right file size otherwhise).
I'm gonna give it another try, maybe I made a mistake.

Thanks a lot

You were right, I might have do something wrong the first time. It worked perfectly.
Great mods to do now. Too bad we just can't use all of our past models and mods (2011 for exemple).
I hope we will be able to tweak 3D models again.... one day

And how did you finally fix the WWE12 models in WWE13?

No older models dont work yet and may not work it would rest on chrrox making a new importer for 3ds max and hoping brienj can do something with his exporter

I have not really fixed the models, I have a work around, their is a code problem with the models not a texture problem.. 
and its to do with the emotions animations if you remove the blood textures the models play in game fine but in create a story the face is darker and has some lighting issues
the model have the same texture as the new models and bones are named  the same.. so its still a miss...

I have remade all the textures to the right mipmaps and sizes and the game still loads them fine with the same errors..

Ok, It seems that it's more complicated than before...
We can still modif the spec map and the opacity is now one of the RGB channel (mask map)
But the sweat system is a little bit tricky now. It seems that there is no map of it like in 2011 for exemple.
I made a Nation of Domination Faarroq and it looks really cool but the model keep sweating on his top attire.
It's not really a big deal since the year again, sweat is not really noticeable.

I spent a lot of time on 2011, I barely play wwe12. In fact I gave it a try a few months before wwe13 came out.
I started modding Ezequiel Jackson into Ahmed Jonhson and was hoping to inject him in wwe13...

So many things are new to me now.
No doubt that the coming weeks and months are going to ne quite exciting...! 

By the way, a HUGE THANK YOU to DRAVEn, Redman, Tekken57, Chrrox, Tich, Plodtrew, Brienj and all the guys that make it so great and bring so much fun!

@draven, can you explain the menu glitch you mentioned? When I select diva's it doesnt bring up the old style menu. If we can select wresters using the old style menu, there will be no need to add them as dlc.

I've already added wresters to unused slots and also enabled the npc's, but there is no way to select them at the moment. Well except if you select them in the royal rumble as the old style menu is used when selecting computer opponents. 

@tich, yes you can hex edit the save and xpacker will fix it for you. I'm only adding functionality to edit the wrestler info though as I don't people to use xpacker for online cheating.

cool, I was thinking of editing save to inject caws and arenas, not to cheat online, so if xpacker allow us to fix save, I'll finally will be able to oinject caw and arena on my save

I don't want to tell you how to make your programs, but if you really don't want people to cheat online, I advise to check that the checksum is correct when opening the save, that way your program is only fixing the checksum for what people change with YOUR program.  Another way to do it, which I explained to PUR3 RAF3X, is to update the checksum based on what your program changes, so if the checksum was incorrect before being opened by your program, by people changing things on their own, after it leaves your program, the checksum will still no longer be any good.  

This is how I've been making my newer programs the past couple years.  If you don't do it this way, you may as well add the ability to change everything in your program, because people will be able to do it anyway with a hex editor and then use your program to fix the checksum.  If you don't want to be associated with cheating online, this is the ONLY way you can make the program.

BTW, when I went to add some wrestlers as DLC, I was having problems with the wrestler's brand showing as an unknown brand in Universe, as well as you not being able to change the brand using the game interface.  Are you able to add people to different slots and actually have the brand work correctly for them?  If so, I may help on making the DLC to add wrestlers as DLC.

Thats a good idea to check the checksum when opening the save, never thought of that. Thanks for the suggestion. 

I never tired changing the brand before until you mentioned it now. When I assign a wrestler to an unused slot, the brand does appear in the game. I can change it in x-packer but not the in game interface. The game gives me the "Superstar cannot be transferred to this brand ... minimum roster of 15 ..." error. 

I've noticed that this error also occurs with the NPC's.

Yeah, that's the error, and I am wondering if there is some game file that has a list of usable slots in Universe, kind of like the costume list in the misc.pac file.  I haven't had time to look through all the game files, but I have a feeling that there is either a list like that, that tells the game not to allow new slots into Universe mode, or it could possibly be hard-wired into the xex file, but I doubt that, since they would have to update the xex file with each DLC pack they released.  When the next DLC pack comes out, we should be able to narrow it down to that list being in one of the files in the DLC.  

It wouldn't help people with retail 360s, but at least JTAG, RGH, and devkit 360s could fix it, and to be honest, I really don't even care about making things work for retail anymore.

BTW, if you have debug capabilities on your 360, I'll eventually be making a trainer of some sort.

So great to see you doing stuff with this game--especially considering the fact that I'm finally looking into getting a JTAG.

As for the next batch of DLC, it's out next Tuesday (12/4), so you should hopefully be able to find your answer then.

Not the emotion bug but the lighting bug.
It happen to me when my wwe12 model came in first for a match and he shows just fine when he comes second.... weird.
I know that Draven found a way but he doesn't seem to be around....

I was also wondering in waht pac file are stored the superstars pic ?

Thank you for any kind of help!

I'm currently trying to find out how to get to the crowd textures for this year's game in the audience.pac, but I'm beyond stumped right now. I've had quite a bit of success in accessing .pacs from '13 (360) that the current build of X-Packer doesn't handle, such as arenas and stuff, but I just can't figure this one out. Even once you get down to the .pach header with a hex editor, which would usually allow you to use the X-Packer from there, it seems as if there's another header shortly after it which will just stall up the program while it loads and never do anything.

I would love to be able to texture mod the crowd(s) and default signs, so if anyone has any idea on what to do here, I'm all ears and would definitely appreciate it.

Another thing I'm trying to figure out (but not nearly as urgent) is finding the 'A' button texture that appears in text boxes in Story Designer cutscenes. I'm looking to make the texture transparent, or just black, so it doesn't appear at all, but I've been unable to locate it. I think I found one .pac that had to do with the Story Designer, but I couldn't get any textures from it.

Maybe you should be looking in the right pac files.  Just think about it logically, WHERE are the audience members located?  Heck, you even mentioned already opening them up.  Start exploring one of those pac files.

Am I the only one having issues with the dlc pack 2?  I downloaded it, put it in the right folder and my game freezes. I thought  itmight have something to do with my edited game files, so then i went back to the original files, and still it would freeze. Then i deleted the 2nd dlc file and saw it loaded fine with the 1st pack like always, so i then took the dlc pack 2 and resigned it.  Then it started working!  But to my surprise the game would not let me save at all, kept saying "save failed!...." So then I had to delete all the files and put them back in the folder.  It would then allow me to save again but once again the dlc pack 2 made the game freeze.... (It loads up, but it freezes when i try to start a match, edit moveset or entrance.  Anyone have any suggestions?  I have not edited the DLC at all, just downloaded it and uploaded it thats it.

But to my surprise the game would not let me save at all, kept saying "save failed!...." So then I had to delete all the files and put them back in the folder.  It would then allow me to save again but once again the dlc pack 2 made the game freeze.... (It loads up, but it freezes when i try to start a match, edit moveset or entrance.  Anyone have any suggestions?  I have not edited the DLC at all, just downloaded it and uploaded it thats it.
Install TU1.  I had all kinds of freezing until that thing came out.

Theres only one TU right?  If so then i have it, but the problem is, sometimes the game starts up and sometimes it doesnt when i have it in the cache folder.

If you don't have a retail system, then don't put it in the cache, actually patch your xex file and install the other files that came with the patch file.  Open the patch file with LeFluffie to extract it all.  Use xextool to patch the original default.xex file with the default.xexp file.  Then take the new default.xex file, along with all the other files that were extracted, and put them in your game folder, over-writing each and every file with the ones from the patch.  Then you never have to worry about the patch not working, and the patch won't conflict if you modify any game files, which I bet is the problem you are having.  You can NOT run any TU patch on a non-retail system, if you modify ANY of the game files, you must install the patch with the steps I said, and then modify the new files.  As I said before though, I would never run the game without the patch ever again, because you'll get nothing but freezes all the time.

To add to my previous post to OverTheEdge, about the audience.pac file, here is what is contained in the audience.pac file -



Audience.pac.jpg (181.85 KiB) Viewed 108 times



As you can tell, it contains all the signs that the audience members hold, and there are a bunch of them, but as I said before, the actual audience members are not in the file.  I am working on making an extractor, so everyone can extract the files like I can.

Not sure what happened to my last reply. Probably something to do with that board being down, but in case you didn't see it, I'd like to say thanks again, brienj. Found the crowd. Not sure why I thought the 0190.pac was the only one with actual textures in it (like how the 000C is the only one with the color.dds for wrestlers). I greatly appreciated you pointing me in the right direction.

On the note of the audience.pac/crowd signs and your extractor, I'm definitely looking forward to that. It looks ridiculously useful.

Hey hows it going guys?  I havent really played wwe13 for a while now but i just download the dlc 3 and Im ready to give it another round.  Only problem is i have this issue with the patch.  Now i tried to do everything that brienj said but for some reason after i patch the xex file and i try to load the game I keep getting "This game couldn't start. Try downloading it again."  I've followed just about every tutorial i could find to patch the xex file with xextool.  When i use the original xex file its loads up fine but at the selection screen it always freezes on me.  Can anyone help?  This is getting frustrating...

Download my WWE12-WWE13 Texture Tool from 360Haven.  Included inside the rar file is the TU1 able to be installed on the HD where it should be installed.  Never install TUs in the cache folder if you intend to mod a game.  Also, make sure you deleted the TU in the cache, if you ever installed it there.

Alright first let me say thanks brienj for trying to help.  Ok now let me say that this is driving me crazy.  Draven sent me all of the dlc files hes using as well as the patched files... I installed everything, and made sure the TU wasn't in the cache anymore.  But guess what?  Still freezes on me.  It happens when I choose any of the wrestlers from dlc pack 2 or 3.  Either when trying to start a match or in CAE.  I've tried just about everything, I even installed a fresh install of the game on a unused USB and it still does the same.  If I load up the game with just the first day dlc without the other 2 packs the game loads up and runs fine.  I am starting to think it may have something to do with my system but I play nba2k13 all the time and have no issues.  The only issue i had, which i mentioned to draven, is for some reason sometimes i go to save my file in nba2k13 and afterwards when i try to load it, it says the file is damaged and it continuously does that with any file i save until i restart the system and clear the cache,  (The same thing happened with wwe13 once but hasn't happened in a long time). Do you have anymore suggestions?  This is crazy I dont know what it could be?
