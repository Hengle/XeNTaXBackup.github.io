Hi guys,
Can somebody make a converter .isg.ckd to .txt and vice versa, please?
I thought that structure will be the same as in Rayman Legends, but no, it's a new one.

Edit it with notepad++, is going to be a little irritating, but for the moment is the only solution.

Try this [http://www.sendspace.com/file/7g5i8u](http://www.sendspace.com/file/7g5i8u)
There are some unknown values, but i hope it will work in the entire game.

Looks like if you unpack the lang file, open the ipk search its name and change the extension to something else, the game will load the unpacked one.

You can find the source of the tool here: [http://zenhax.com/viewtopic.php?f=12&t=645](http://zenhax.com/viewtopic.php?f=12&t=645)
Just download Autoit and the BinaryUDF and you can build it.

I will upload the exe, if you can't make it.

I figured it out, and the code is working, but I'm hitting a roadblock. I kind of want to make a mod for this game, but I can't get the game to load the new english localization. If I rename the file localization_english.isg to localization_english.is0 in the bundle_pc32.ipk, I get french instead of english. If I don't rename that file, the new localization file doesn't load. I am putting the modified localization_english.isg.ckd in the Child of Light\enginedata\localization folder. That is where it should go, yes?

Is there some way, how repack .ipk files?

Some tips?

No need the repack. 
1- Unpack files copy
2- Paste this directions "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Child of Light"
3- Delete bundle_pc32.ipk files

Localization files: \cache\itf_cooked\pc32\enginedata\localization\localization_brazilian.isg.ckd

Swuforce, could you help me with the Darkwatch of PS2? creating a script to help me edit the texts. I think it's a simple file type.
