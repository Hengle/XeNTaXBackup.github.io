- Post Title: Main menu sluggish in painkiller

Hey,
On versions of painkiller that are later versions, if I select 4K resolutions (3820x2160 I think), the game itself runs ok, but the main menus where you select new game, load save etc are
very sluggish with the mouse cursor, I've tried editing the lua code for the main menu, but nothing I do has any effect on the mouse problem, please note that older versions of pk (mainly
demos) that don't go higher then 1600 res don't do this, I'm running dsr mode set in the nvidia control panel, any help would be greatly appreciated!

Thanks!
