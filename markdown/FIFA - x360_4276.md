- Post Title: FIFA - x360

Hi, i managed to extract the file that contains the commentary in fifa 09 and its header file and some other files..they were in the same folder in the ISO , so maybe they are important.
Then i extracted the .dat files from the speech_dat.big with biggui but cant manage to convert them to wav with a dat to wav converter that works with the pc version of the game though. Maybe thats because the header, in pc the header of the file is in the .dat file, but in xbox360 the header is separated from the dat.
So the point is, i want to convert .dat files to .wav inside the .big, i need those commentary speechs.
Please someone could help?

regards
