Indeed. Though I'm no Apple fan.

I think it would be wise to put everything in perspective. Apple hyped their stuff, and Steve Jobs is also overrated. Some people act like he was the second coming of the Messiah, and I laugh in their faces.  How little they understand. 

Still, he was good at what he did, and a loss for Apple.

Actually, I think that's pretty much exactly what I've been trying to say without any luck; perspective is key in all things.  

I have no great love for Apple myself (personally, I don't think they're much better than a hipster Microsoft), but they're still a force to be reckoned with, and they have influenced our everyday world. Jobs led much of this (case in point: Apple's stagnation in the time that he wasn't involved with the company), which just serves to underscore his genius. Even if you loathed the man with every fiber of your being, I'd like to think you would still be able to take something away from a five-minute conversation with him, were you to have had such an opportunity (DISCLAIMER: "you" in this paragraph is nonspecific).

I'm personally not so sure Jobs's death is anything more than a spiritual loss for Apple, considering he'd already stepped down as CEO of the company in August (but then, what do I know, I'm just a clueless twenty-something in Nowheresville, United States =D ).

Agreed.

I myself am not an Apple fan too.
Their stuff are way too overhyped and fancy.
But overrated is a good word.

But the second Messiah?
I'd like to join you for laughing in their faces haha.
