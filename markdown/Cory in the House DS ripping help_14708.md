- Post Title: Cory in the House DS ripping help

I've been trying to rip models from Cory in the House DS. (cause you know, memes and stuff)

The models appear to be stored in .mdl format, and the textures are stored in .tex format. I think the .skl file might be skeleton data? Not too sure. How can I convert these files to a usable format? Are there any other games that use this format?

Here is a download link for some sample files:
