- Post Title: Batman Arkham Asylum demo audio rip

I apologise if this has already been answered in a previous post but I'm trying extract the: music, speech, and sfx from the B:AA demo. I've been able to get the files down to .Packages and SoundNodes but I'm unsure both what to do next, (as all the .ogg extractors including Jaeder Naub I have tried have either failed or been virus filled) and whether or not I'll be getting all the audio files I want. Any help welcome.

Also is it the same method for the full game Arkham City?

arkham asylum uses two formats, soundnodewave's (rename to .ogg) and fmod banks (in which you must search for the "FSB4" header within, then convert with fsb_mpeg or fsbext (fsbext works better on some, and fsb mpeg works better on some with cmd -p 10 option) This was a major pain to find all out 3 years ago, if you need more specific help, pm me. I don't have either game installed atm, but i know the newer arkham city uses wwise audio instead of fmod and soundnodewave, but for all it's sounds. I'll install the arkham city demo myself in the mean time so if you pm me i can be more useful. hoping steam doesnt force me to install the full game when i just want the demo like it does with bioshock.

Thankyou for the advice I'll follow it and pm you results. Hope Steam co-operates.
