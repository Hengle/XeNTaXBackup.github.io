if you need more examples take a look to the homepage of the project, I collect all the scripts I write there:
[http://bms.aluigi.org](http://bms.aluigi.org)

the only thing "missing" are the sample files from which I wrote the scripts but you can find them via google using site:xentax.com because I get almost all the samples from the requests on this forum
