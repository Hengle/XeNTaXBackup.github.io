- Post Title: Tales of Vesperia (PS3) .DAT model file

I've heard there was delguoqing the only user in VG Resource who could convert .DAT models into readable .OBJ files and managed to find the bones, but seeing as delguoqing might not be active any more and not releasing any more models anymore,  I could hope someone (or delguoqing if he/she comes back) has managed to get these files converted.

I know that he managed to convert the models for Nier Automata, but seeing as his latest visit is at Oct 10, 2018 in his xentax account, he might be coming back soon.

I've had some progress on XBox360 version only.
At a time, I looked at PS3 version to see if I can add support for PS3 version, but without luck.
The format changed A LOT: the basic structure changed not that much, but there're tiny changes here and there, extra fields, fields with different size, etc.
I didn't bother to explore any deeper.

plus, the Definitive Edition is going to be released.
Maybe we'd wait until then.

For PC version characters:

Here is a blend file to:
-extract svo archive ==>dat files
-decompres dat ==> dec files
-import dec : autotexturing+weights+bones 

Format of models is complex . 
Not all models have full skeleton. 

Use as usually for Blender version 2.49.
You need:
[http://download.blender.org/release/Ble ... indows.exe](http://download.blender.org/release/Blender2.49b/blender-2.49b-windows.exe)
and
[https://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.6.6 ... -2.6.6.msi](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.6.6/python-2.6.6.msi)

Unpack archive, doubleclick on file "Blender249.blend" , press alt+p in Blender Text Window and import



It is only a hobby project. 
I used Noesis written by Rich Whitehouse to convert DX10 to png.

I haven't had a chance to look into the games files just yet, but does this script work on the static mesh models?
For example environment objects

@delguoqing
The DLC files are different from the ones in .svo files, can you convert this?

Also, I noticed you were trying to convert animation files for the XBOX360 version of the game, can you try that again in the PC version?

I noticed you f*cked up the UVs of RIT_C000 and RIT_C001 (the hand models), not sure for the rest of the PC version .dat model files that I haven't checked yet.

any chance of ripping TOV models on PC? seems the one used for the PS3 is long gone.
