I'm trying to figure out how to extract mh4u 3ds .arc. 

I've tried ARCtool, I don't know if I'm using arctool right. 
I don't know how to run these python scripts, like mhff.

Nevermind I got a bms script to extract them, now I have these .tex files which I don't know how to convert them to a image format. 

Anything that can help?
