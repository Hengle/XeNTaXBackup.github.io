- Post Title: Scarface TWIS file named "1"

so I was looking through the art directory of the cement.rcf and I found an interesting file labeled "1". it has no extension and a rather large file size [1.5GB]

methinks this may possibly be the full game map model. although I have no idea how I should handle this and felt it would be better to post about it here.


I am not too familiar with the rules on files such as this but I can upload and post (or PM) a download link to anyone interested in it.

This is just a copy of the cement.rcf file (even the file size is the same)
