Hi all. 

I've made (with a LOT of help from GMMan) a very simple space shooter (based on the Survival Mod by GMMan for the game "Space Interceptor: Project Freedom") that is set in the Star Wars universe. I wanted a "Space Invaders" kind of shoot-em-up game, but in a 3D enviroment and with good graphics...



Everything is ready, except for the player's ship (which needs to be replaced by an X-Wing) and the enemy ships (TIE fighters). 

If anyone's interested in intergrating LWO, 3DS or other ship models, please PM me for a download link of the mod as it is now.
