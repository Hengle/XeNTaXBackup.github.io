- Post Title: PROTOTYPE 1 Animation Extraction Help

So, i'm just gonna keep this quick.

A program called Edit3D was created a LONG time ago, and it is supposed to allow you to edit the P3D format, such as textures. (Though I still haven't gotten this working myself, and personally don't need it to work.) It has the entire P3D format in a readable format (sort of). Here's an [image ](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/299622545160929292/639631175194771475/unknown.png) of the program (Loaded on alex.p3d due to his huge amount of anims).

Now, what i'm asking is if anybody here knows how to extract the animations in the P3D into a more modern format. I don't want to beg, which is why i'm asking on a forum and not PMing people. Please do help out if you can, it would mean the world to me, and a couple friends

If you are interested, I will supply you with the things you need and I promise I won't leave you on read for 2 days . Other than that, thanks for reading and have a great day.

I should also mention I don't need the models, that's not something i'm worried about, as I've already gotten the prototype blender script working.

The only pieces of information I can find outside of Rick's Game Stuff are a few threads scattered around that only mention mesh extraction such as [this ](https://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?t=8804) one. 

It's entirely possible, just not sure how you'd get the animation data and export it accordingly..

What does it show when you unfold (fully) one of the listed anims?

The only thing that pops up is a bunch of "unknowns". The second drop down opens up 50+ with even more drop downs.
And there is a button for exporting, but it only supports DDS, and you have to manually set the extension.


Additionally on the side it gives information about the animation itself:

Maybe now? I really wish someone would just give some closure after a month of waiting.

Sadly, it seems like this thread is pretty much a graveyard atm.. I've been really looking forward to those models and animations too, for a LONG time

Man this really sucks, i've been wanting a reliable way to export for years now which includes animation stuff, if it was just as easy as reading keyframe data in the animation for bone translation, rotation, and scale it'd be awesome.

This thread has been pretty dead for a couple months now, just wanted to ask if anyone was interested in helping out now.
