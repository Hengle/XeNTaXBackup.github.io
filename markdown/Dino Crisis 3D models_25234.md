- Post Title: Dino Crisis 3D models

Hello everyone!
Is someone capable here to extract the 3D models of Dino Crisis (characters, rooms geometry, doors) in an editable format (so they can be edited in programs like Blender or 3ds Max) and then reimport them back into the game data?
I know where the 3D models are stored in the files (always in the last segment of each stage or door file, like STxxx.DAT or DOORxx.DAT, the archives can be decompressed thanks to the available tools like Dino Clasher or Dino Archiver) and there has been some documentation about the 3D model structures, so I can always give help in case somebody is interested in making a tool or something for exporting/importing 3D models into the game. I would even pay for such tool, as this game is just way more than a game to me, it's my entire childhood 

The PSX and PC versions are basically the same in terms of file structures and data so it doesn't really matter which version / platform (The Dreamcast version on the other hand is slightly different)
