Hello all,

I would ask you for help with 1 problem here. I need repack the TLK file for game MassEffect 2. i found the editor and also Source code written in C# for it. That editor includes also X360 repacker but repack of TLK is not working correctly and game crashing after all. Can anyone help me please to make it work correctly. I'm even willing to pay if someone is gonna help me here. Attached the example of X360 tlk file and also Source code for Editor(includes 3 classes only). For skilled dev it is a peice of cake. So please help me out.
Also able to do all live tests for it.
