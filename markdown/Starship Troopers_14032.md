Hi !
I would like to work on the textures of ST for make an HD version (i hope), I found 3d object converter to extract models, because I noticed that in the folder " asset art " we have access has all the textures of the game.

But when i modified the textures modified, she not taken by the game (same format).

I would like to know if somebody of you would have a solution?

Texture format : DDS
Model format : SBM

If you need more info, ask me 

Thank you
