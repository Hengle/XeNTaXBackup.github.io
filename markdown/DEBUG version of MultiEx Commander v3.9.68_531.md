- Post Title: DEBUG version of MultiEx Commander v3.9.68

I am working on a more accurate debug version of MultiEx Commander v3.9.68 (the sourceforge.net version is at 3.9.69, but that doesn't matter in this case, they don't really differ that much, so you get version 3.9.69).
You must however create a "plugins" directory in the "data" directory of MultiEx Commander. 
I have included more information to be logged (if this "Always on start-up" check is set in the Options menu!). The log will then be placed in the "data" directory of MultiEx Commander. 

The information that has been included in debug version 1 is mostly stuff happening during importation of files.

You can get the latest debug version here:
[MCDebug3968.1](http://www.xentax.com/downloads/multiex/mc32debug.zip)

NOTE: IF ASKED DO NOT GET THE LATEST VERSION FROM THE WEB, THIS
IS ONLY ASKED BECAUSE THE DEBUG VERSION IS UNOFFICIAL! JUST SAY NO AND CONTINUE. 

So, if you encounter any problems, send the log to [mr.mouse@xentax.com](mailto:mr.mouse@xentax.com) and state "MultiEx DEBUG" in the Subject line of the mail!
