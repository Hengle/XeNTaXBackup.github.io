Hi.
I have a small question regarding modding a game.  Do all you guys, who have successfully modded a game's models/textures or anything, use a modded xbox to play/test your modded works?  To me it sounds highly unlikely cause, won't it like require the modders to burn up a new dvd everytime they want to test a change they've made?  see i m a noob to all this and really confused about this step only, so please any reply/help is welcome. 
Thanks!

I'm not speaking out of a lot of experience, but usually when I play a modded game I do so either on a system that supports HDD or memory stick backups (like the HDD loader program for PS2, PSP, and the like) 
or I run them in emulators (ePSXe, PCSX2)
Or for that matter they are games that run on PC and are thus nearly always HDD driven to begin with.

I don't imagine anyone who mods much does so without some sort of quick testing method like an emulator, or a system that allows ISO usage.

This is only indicative of my experience, though. 

Also some games don't require any source edits to swap character models and the like, as modifying memory addresses at runtime with a cheat device can occasionally work. (Xenosaga III as an example)
