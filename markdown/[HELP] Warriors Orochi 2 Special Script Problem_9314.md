Old Post

Hello there guys/girls
may i ask a request for Warriors Orochi 3 Script "Main Menu, Story, Character Name etc." in English.
we are planning to translate the Warriors Orochi 2 Special for the PSP, we need the script since we lack translator "we only have one"

Also may i ask request to extractor/rebuilder for LINKDATA_A.bin & LINKDATA_B.bin

Thanks in Advance.

unfortunately, only two people have ever worked on ripping from dynasty warriors, chris and I (and I think that Polish guy did a little work on it too). Chris I think, got bored after DW7 and I got bored too after One Piece. here is my [One Piece code](http://code.google.com/p/sticklove/source/browse/trunk/source/xentax/ripper/ps3_one_piece.cpp) for anyone who wants to try messing with any of the DW games (if you can figure it out lol). The bones logic is in the DW7 thread. So if anyone else wants to try (demonsangel? finale00?) the newer Tecmo games, feel free to do so cuz I am burned out after Gundam and One Piece.

OK. I will work on it after I finish Saint's Row, but models only as I don't really care about nor know too much about translation and the PSP. Note that all major characters will probably have missing parts due to cloth physics.
