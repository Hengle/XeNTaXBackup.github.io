- Post Title: Halo 2 Vista Bitmap Help

Well im Grimdoomer from Halomods, and I've been working on Gravemind, a halo 2 vista modding app. I can't seem to get any of the bitmaps decoded successfully though. The raw is different from halo 2 xbox and those docoding methods will not work any more.

Here is 2 samples, bolth are DXT compressed images. But the're not normal DXT images. There is something different about them, but I don't know what.

If any one can successfully view one of these images PLEASE let me know. I'll be on aim and MSN for a while so you can hit me up at aim: xXplayerificXx or MSN: [doomwiz@hotmail.com](mailto:doomwiz@hotmail.com)

Compressed with zlib. Thats all. But the extracter files have no header (like DDS).
