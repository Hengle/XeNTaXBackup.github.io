How do I extract models from life is strange remastered? As all the info I can find is for true colors or the original release.
Umodel asks for the ue4 version number and crashes when trying open any files from the pak archives and fmodel throws an conversion error when trying to open the meshswaps in the char folder. That probably isn't a drm issue as Hogwarts legacy, kingdom hearts iii, final fantasy vii remake and jedi fallen order worked mostly without issues
