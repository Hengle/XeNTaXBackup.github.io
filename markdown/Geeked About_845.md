You bet. 

Pirates! was a way of live on my Commodore 64. 

One of my all-time favourites is Mike Singleton's Lords of Midnight

You had to gain allies in a large semi-3d world, moving with multiple characters and armies, fighting batltles across the land, besieging Citadels, or defending them, all set in a fantasy world. The goal: destroy the armies of the Icemark, led by the Ice Queen. It was utterly involving. 

And of course, Elite. Name says it all. 

Rcently I have played Thief 3 to death. I'm a big fan of the series. 

Also, Morrowind has kept me busy for months.

Thief was awesome cuz it was so different, non-kill everything that moves.

Another game I really loved on the C64, that i'd love to be remade, was Mail Order Monsters.

Build a monster with money and then fight with them on a field, could be an awesome multiplayer game (Online).

Indeed, Civilization rocked. 

Dune 2 was one of the best things I did on the Amiga.

I totally agree - civilization and transport tycoon are the best group of games to come out - followed by similar titles such as the simcities, rollercoaster tycoons, etc.

Oh, and transport tycoon was by Chris Sawyer, not Sid Miyer, however both are legends!

On the MSX I played King's Valley, Metal Gear, Nemesis, Maze of Galious and others. One of the top publishers was Konami. They own. 

Creatures (featuring Clyde Radcliffe) was also a very good title on the Commodore 64. Also  :Sanxion, Feud, Commando, Turrican, Lemmings (yes, they actually did it), Return of the Mutant Camels, M.U.L.E. Uridium, One man and his Droid, Zoids, Antiriad, Monty on the Run, Bubble Bobble etc. !!!
