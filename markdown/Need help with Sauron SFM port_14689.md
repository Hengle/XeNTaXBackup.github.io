- Post Title: Need help with Sauron SFM port

so the really frustrating part about this is that I cant compile the .QC file
one reason being valve screwed up the Source SDK so I cant compile it by traditional means,
another could be I screwed up some how on the QC itself because this has been my first attempt at an SFM port
if someone can help i'll PM you the folder that contains everything for this model, I used the Shadow of Mordor Maxscript to get the model and bones+weights, and used blender to port get him in .smd (and somehow he's split up in four different smd files, that could be another reason it's messing up)
so yeah if someone can help i'd be most thankful  

here is a preview of Sauron
