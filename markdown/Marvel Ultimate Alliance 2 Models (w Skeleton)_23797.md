- Post Title: Marvel Ultimate Alliance 2 Models (w/ Skeleton)

Hey guys I know this topic has probably been brought up before, but I would just like to know if there's a chance to get any of th MUA2 models with their skeletons intact exported into a format like DAE, or FBX.

Here's the link with all the models: [https://mega.nz/folder/aFM3mQYB#bftH7Vb8mGyebbwMP1v8Vw](https://mega.nz/folder/aFM3mQYB#bftH7Vb8mGyebbwMP1v8Vw)
