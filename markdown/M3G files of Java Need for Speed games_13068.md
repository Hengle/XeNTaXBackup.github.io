- Post Title: M3G files of Java Need for Speed games

Got interested in these lovely lowpoly meshes.
A short investigation revealed that the models, while being openable in M3GViewer, had their textures stored in separate M3Gs, thus are displayed in plain white. Opening texture files in the same tool doesn't show anything. Meshes from Hot Pursuit, The Run and Most Wanted don't seem to differ.


...aaand this is where my investigations come to an end, as further progress would require better programming and file structure knowledge, which I obviously lack.
I wonder if anybody can give me a hand here. I can provide any file needed for research.
If there's a tool that can export M3G meshes and texture, please point me at it, as even Google failed to.
