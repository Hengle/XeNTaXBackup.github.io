- Post Title: D1XN engine (The MusicMan)

Hello
Me and my team started translation new chinese game The MusicMan to English and Russian and already translated about 50% game UI, but there's a trouble - some UI files are crypted. May be just changed headers, idk.
Also there are three packs which contains .lua but also creypted.

I attached archive with samples. So, can somebody help?
