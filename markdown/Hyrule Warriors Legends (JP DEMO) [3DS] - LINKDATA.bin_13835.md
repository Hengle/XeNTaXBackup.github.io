- Post Title: Hyrule Warriors Legends (JP DEMO) [3DS] - LINKDATA.bin

Hey Guys, right now I want to check the files of the Hyrule Warriors Legends DEMO for the 3DS.
The problem is, the files are stored in a Archive called "LINKDATA.bin".
I don't think that this archive is a encrypted one because I can read all Strings of the Game with Notepad++

I've uploaded the file (+ a .idx file, not sure if this file is needed)
[https://mega.nz/#!QssWzYrY!qhIlpr8hfKIf ... 6YJNXRISHM](https://mega.nz/#!QssWzYrY!qhIlpr8hfKIfnGvFgX3xHBOTYGY-ieTha6YJNXRISHM)

Would be awesome if someone could help me to extract/rebuild this file.
