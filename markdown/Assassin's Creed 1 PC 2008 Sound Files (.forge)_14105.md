- Post Title: Assassin's Creed 1 PC 2008 Sound Files (.forge)

I just started to replay one of my favorite games of all time, the original Assassin's Creed that started the franchise. I have always wanted to get the sounds from weapons and even Altair's voice, but I just can't figure it out. The sounds are in .forge format, and when I extract them with Maki 1.2, I just get a lot of files that don't even have an extension. Please help

It took a while to upload, it's a pretty large file.
