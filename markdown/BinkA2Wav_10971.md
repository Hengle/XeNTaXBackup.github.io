- Post Title: BinkA2Wav

I cleaned up the original BinkA2Wav by AngelSL into a full program with recursive directory processing. The program is useful for converting Bink Audio files, which can be found in some games, like Scribblenauts Unlimited.

Do you have mss32.dll and binkawin.asi in the same folder as the program? You have to supply your own.
