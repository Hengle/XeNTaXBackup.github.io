To celebrate the 5 year anniversary of the Xentax Game Research Forum this year, we are organizing a graphic contest! The idea is to create a new header for the forum that will serve as front from then on! Winner takes $125, second $50 and third $25! If you think are up to it, then here’s the requirements:
Entries should be in PNG or JPG format, with source files depending on art program 
Dimensions Width x Height = 1024 (max) x 150 pixels 
Games, Gaming and/or Game Research themes are obligatory 
XeNTaX logo/text should preferably retain the XNTX capitalization 
The text “Game Research Forum” must be sufficiently legible 

Conditions:
Points are awarded by forum visitors and the board of the Xentax Foundation 
Xentax Foundation has the final verdict, because the winning entry must fit the overall aim, purpose and layout of the site if it is to to be used. This verdict cannot be contested. 
If not enough entries are submitted, the contest will be forfeit. There will be a reward solely for the best entry up to that time ($50). 
Deadline: March 15th 2008
Submit you entries to info@xentax.com.   

This thread can be used to discuss the event.

Well, perhaps we can celebrate that also, and the fact that you are now officially WikiMaster.  

Anyway, I do hope we can reach out to artists to submit stuff, though. We should maybe campaign more.
