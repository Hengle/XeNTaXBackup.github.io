- Post Title: FAR CRY 3 Compressing

Hi, guys.
Look at this file. There are three files in it. XML file contain all strings in itself. I must compress XML to BIN.
Any Idea?

Thanks, for trying to help, Ekey, but Rick's Dunia 2 tools don't have a specific program for XML to BIN converting to make localization possible.

There are some tools for the bin file, all based on rengareng's format description.
Its really hard format (for me), but i hope it will work. Make some tests please before you start translating.
