You can unpack the .RES files with this tool i posted few months ago : [viewtopic.php?f=10&t=3443](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=3443)
If you want to translate the game you will need this tool here : [viewtopic.php?f=21&t=3826](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=21&t=3826)

Have fun !

Unfortunately, there's a starforce protection in the demo and i can't see how the game deals with the DB file.

Here's my first, test version of Centrauri games translator utility. Tested with "Gooka" and "Pat and Mat",
but it hopefully works with some more games too. (for example: "Alternativa", "Memento Mori")
See the program's "About" box for more info. Test version, under development, so handle with care!!!

Attached file deleted. See my latest post for the most recent version.

It's with the program of Bacter that in not possible to decompile the file res.
But with your program Centauri_Production_Text_File_5.00_converter_v1.0 " however, it's impossible to decompile the text file of Fairy Tale.
It's a file"cp textfile 2.1 ". (see attachments)
I would like to also point out to you and Bacter has a problem with the game Alternativa.
Even without changing the text, I get an error after compile when I run the game.
"Message: CPL3D-Error : Incompatible patch files applied.Please, reinstall."

Where's the problem in my tools? Is it in the RES pack/unpacker or in the DB converter ?

Fairy tale: The DB converter is not able to convert the text file because:
1) is a file "text file PC 2.1" while the file of Gooka is a "CP text file 3"  and the text file of the Alternativa " 5 "----> it's therefore natural that your converter is designed for file type "5" can not convert.
2) The file extension is not DB  but TXF 
[Text.txf](http://www.mediafire.com/?yyu8nufu4b7i5n0)

Alternativa: I do not know if it comes from your packer / unpacker (I have the same problem with the program Bacter) but simply change one letter in the text causes a crash when launching the game after recompilation.
Message: Incompatible patchfiles applied. Please, reinstall.
If I recompile with the original text file all returns ok.

O.K. I solved the mystery of the Alternativa error message: Incompatible patchfiles applied. Please, reinstall.

You have to modify the text in the "patch1012212001.res" file! Don't edit the other .res files. (I think you tried to modify the "ALTERNATIVA.res".)

Thank you for your answers.
Actually I was not working on the correct file.
I just checked. It works with the patch file.
Xpozed, I never said that Centauri_Production_Text_File_5.00_converter_v1.0 was able to compile the text file of Fairy Tale (but I liked it so much he can do .....).
I take my answer to thank you both for making all these tools that allow me to do translations (Alternativa, Treasure Island, Alter Ego, etc. ...).

Updated my tool. Now you can extract or create new .RES files.
And now, here's a quick update.
