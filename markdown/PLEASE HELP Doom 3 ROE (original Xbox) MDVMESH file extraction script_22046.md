- Post Title: PLEASE HELP Doom 3 ROE (original Xbox) MDVMESH file extraction script?

Hi,

As the title says is there any script for quickbms, specifically for extraction of GFC and GOB files for the original Xbox port of Doom 3 Resurrection of Evil?

Here is a pic of the extracted GFC and GOB Files:

Hi,

My apologies for the double post and as well for bothering you once more but, there are files who have an additional extension that the files for the PC version don't have.

Example:

w_pistol.cm.x

On PC it's called:

w_pistol.cm

There are files called hud.gui as opposed to a hud folder with sub-folders inside which are dds files on PC.

As well as files with the with the .pd. extension.

But the most important file seems to be viewpistollight.mdvmesh. I cant open .mdvmesh file, i tired it with game extractor as well as renaming in and no luck.

EDIT:

I updated the download with the mdvmesh file.

SAMPLE GUI, PD, TWO X FILES AND MDVMESH FILE(S):
[https://we.tl/t-MypE1lRaW3](https://we.tl/t-MypE1lRaW3)

I spend the whole day googling, renaming the files with .x  extension, putting them into the ROE and Doom 3 PC versions but the games never load past the initial loading screen. And today i found put about the mdvmesh file.

So if anyone can take a look and find a way to extract these via a quickbms script (especially the mdvmesh file) and share it here i will be very thankful and i wont bother anyone anymore. 

Since this really has to be the last obstacle to  having the Doom 3/ROE files finally accessible. I really hope so at least.

I apologize once more for yet again another double post. Please help me.

The only file that matters as i have now found out is is viewpistollight.mdvmesh. 

If anybody can make a quickbms script or direct me to a utility that can open mdvmesh files that would be most helpful. And i won't bother you anymore.

I looked at the process of how to make a script, but it might as well be rocket science for me. Its way above my head.

I want to try and convert the pistol with the flashlight attachment into the PC versions of Doom 3 and ROE.
