I'm looking for help preserving the game

The game was shutdown in August of 2020, but I was provided the games assets by some old players. The games files are encrypted though. 
I tried using some tools to look into the game's memory to obtain the keys but can't as the game refuses to boot on emulators. And while it does boot on real hardware it gives a infinite black screen when loading with roots or cloning apps. So any help getting it decrypted would be appreciated.

Sample files:

The APK can still be downloaded from any alternate APK store

Alright I finally managed to get the gaming booting with a rooted device. Ran the tool and tried following some of the tutorials on searching the memory for any keys but I can't make anything of it. So I settled with a full memory dump instead

Dump includes a map file

If anyone could give any tips on how to find the key in memory or find it in the RAM dump that would be appreciated
