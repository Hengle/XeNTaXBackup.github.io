- Post Title: Tekken 7

Hello,

I wanted to know if it was possible to extract the text from TEKKEN 7. More precisely, I'd like to extract the Japanese and Korean texts.
I used BMS to extract the PAK files. The problem is, I only find UASSET files. There is no LOCRES files. Is there a way to find these texts? I really don't know where to look in the files at all. Is there any solution to detect file types? Or a specific term that helps you find where the localization files are?

I'd like to add some samples but I'm not sure where the correct folder is that would contain these files. 



Thank you in advance for your help.

I didn't know Total Commander so thank you for the link!

I searched for keywords such as terms used in character dialogs but there is no file containing these texts. I didn't find anything with "locres" as well.

So text files are probably encrypted or compressed.
You can read some articles here [viewtopic.php?f=29&t=22266](https://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=29&t=22266)
to know how to deal with such files.
