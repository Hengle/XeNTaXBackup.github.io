- Post Title: Help! MultiEx runtime error 339

Heyo, sorry if this is in the wrong forum! I really wasn't sure where to put this.

I've only just installed MultiEx and registered and all that, but everytime I put in my email and the registration code when starting, I get a runtime error, [it saying that msinet.ocx or one of its dependents aren't correctly registered](http://i.imgur.com/xVth5kj.png). Looking in my folder though, I do have it. I downloaded a new version of the .ocx with no change, I've gone and reinstalled MultiEx with no change, I even downloaded a new version of it (well, using the same link) and no change.

Could someone please help with this?

I figured it had to be something small like that. Thanks!
