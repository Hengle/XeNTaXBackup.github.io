- Post Title: prince of persia sound FX

hi every body
  i like to design and create my own windows 7 themes and i started to do a theme for prince of Persia unfortunately it is not like the Movies and cartoon where i used to grab every thing from inside the movie i found that the sound issue is too difficult.
and while i am checking the forums over here i saw that as every body says the problem where i found too is the files are not accessible,and what i couldn't access is the type of (fat,MGM,big,intr,BF)where i am not sure who related to all sounds in the same time people where talking about sb0 which i didn't found yet but about the bink files i get access for all ,in the same time i didn't download pop the forgotten sand or marathon but if i am not wrong they suppose to be the same isn't it?

one more thing most of the tools mentioned in the earlier topics wasn't working in my system(win7 x64 bit) i don't know why and some of it has already no link to download i can believe it is an old matter that i am searching for sorry  

i am attaching a theme shape and i really like to match it with real pop's sounds not outer things 

many thanks 

Noah

No, but instead of that, you can use [this extractor](http://www.box.net/shared/0f0hfp8mz2) for extracting sounds from pop 2008.
