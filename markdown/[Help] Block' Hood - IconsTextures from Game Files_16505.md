- Post Title: [Help] Block' Hood - Icons/Textures from Game Files

Hey folks,

So I'm trying to get the icons from this game called Block' Hood which has Unity files. I've seen some programs but I'm probably misunderstanding it.

I've uploaded the Data Folder of the game which is exactly 231.81MB so you guys can investigate it without installing the game.

I hope to get an answer as soon as possible.

Thank you very much in advanced!
