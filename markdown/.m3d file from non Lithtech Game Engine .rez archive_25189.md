- Post Title: .m3d file from non Lithtech Game Engine .rez archive

Hi there,
as the title says, this does not look like a valid Lithtech .rez (i tried various tools, as .rez doesnt seem to be very uncommon)
however i can see theres IMG and M3D files inside.
Can you please have a look at the file?

Have a nice weekend yall!

Winter X-Games: Snocross from 2010 afaik
it uses granny .gr2 for character models
but the archives for worlds and vehicles is .rez with .m3d models inside

EDIT:

i tried a cars bms script since it was made by raw thrills, too
it got me something but still an error:

```
       Can't read 4 bytes from offset 50194abd.
       Anyway don't worry, it's possible that the BMS script has been written
       to exit in this way if it's reached the end of the archive so check it
       or contact its author or verify that all the files have been extracted.
       Please check the following coverage information to know if it's ok.

  coverage file 0     0%   20         75725830   . offset 50194abd

Last script line before the error or that produced the error:
  13  Get U4 Long 0
```


heres the link to the script i found:

I looked at the file in hex editor again and i think this could be a small enough .m3d file. it should be for one of the snowmobiles decals....so just a handfull of triangles maybe?
unfortunately i am not able to see or recognize any vertex structure

No that is not a GR2 file in anyway.
I see textures and meshes but have not looked hard at it.
could you please have another look at this?

```
math i = 0
do
    goto OFFSET
    get DUMMY long
    findloc NEXT_OFFSET STRING "M3D " 0 ""

     if NEXT_OFFSET == ""

        get SIZE asize
    else
        math SIZE = NEXT_OFFSET

    endif
    math SIZE -= OFFSET
    string NAME p= OFFSET SIZE i
    STRING PATH = NAME

    log "" OFFSET SIZE
    math i += 1
    math OFFSET = NEXT_OFFSET

while NEXT_OFFSET != ""
```


It will extract 760 m3d files, but, i don't know  hot to open it, my knowlodge of 3d stuff is minus 50. lol

just finished importing and alligning all 6 skidoos. Your .grp plugin works like a charm!



i also tried to view one of the .IMG files in texture finder:

...without success though :-/

could you please work your magic again on this file?

UPDATE:
setup all skidoos in blender. you now can enable/disable the upgrades per skidoo much easier (Textures are missing though )
