- Post Title: Pac-Man World 2 - (.ccc, & .nxf)

So, I'm uploading the files for the PC version here. In the PS2 version the model files are listed as .VU1 (geomatry) and HXF (character models) while the PC version uses NXF for all mesh and geomatry it seems. I'm not entirely sure what .ccc exactly is but what I do know is a majority of this game's enviroments were made in Softimage, Maya and 3DSMax apparently. ((Right down to the point the PS2 version had an uncompiled .XSI file for the arcade interior which is viewable in the freely preserved SoftImage Mod Tool)) I'm uploading these here in case somebody can get these figured out or if they can probably get the level geomatry all meshed back into one at least.

point cloud in .hxf easily to be found but face indices are a little bit tricky:

btw, there's no XSI file in your upload.

Ah, I linked to TCRF page as that has the uncompiled RAR with an XSI but I can upload it again here. Just give me a moment.
