- Post Title: Hello, can I have help with nif files and pac files?

Hi, I'm really new to all of this, so I might be doing something wrong here, lol. Um, so anyway, I bought Catherine recently and wanted to extract and use the models. So I managed to extract and all, and I used the Blender script that the nice guy Szkaradek123 made to import nif files.

The thing is, when I load up an nif file, it comes up all funny. The cursor moves around a little, and then, I would see vincent's horns, then his body loads up over it so now his horns are inside his body and he has a pillow, book, and all sorts of stuff sticking out of his chest. D8 Poor guy!

I'm using Blender 2.49b, and the correct python, i think... And sometimes the models wouldn't have textures in some parts, like Orlando has all of his body textures, but his face doesn't, and his eyelashes does. And his hat is at his feet.

What are pac files? Are they textures too?

And if it's not too much trouble, I don't really know what those black lines are... I'm guessing that they might be bones, but they look pretty funny. I'm used to seeing bones in blender to look different than that...

Argh, I'm so sorry if I'm really frustrating. ^^;

Oh thank you very much.  I'm not sure if it will work with Catherine's nif files, but I'm willing to give it a shot.   Gonna try it now!

I've been busy so haven't been doing much with that script.
Kind of lazy with it cause nif is a big format..
