It looks to me like you have a corrupt archive or something... The error message tells me that the pointer in the file indicating size points past the end of the archive. But then, maybe that particular archive isn't supported. I'm not sure.

It looks corrupted, but that may still be due to the script that is doing the processing. In the next version we will see the release of a plugin that will handle all of this Prince of Persia BF stuff excellently, by Rahly.

I installed the game and tried to extract the data from the fresh GRA's, so i don't know how they could've been corrupted. Anyway, now i wait? :)

Yes, I guess you should just wait. I think the script suxx. Perhaps you could use the filecutter to cut the first and last part of the GRA. Then attach it here or upload it somewhere.  I might take a look at it to see what can be done. The cutter you can find in the request rules below. If that doesn't work, do a search for Cutter here at the forums and get Watto's to do the job. Thanks!

If I may, Mr.Mouse, I'd like to go out on a limb and suggest the inclusion of a filecutter in the next version of MexCom... I think it would make things much simpler to include one than have one seperate.

Hmm, that might be an idea, yes.I will put it on my ever extending idea list for MexCom... And I pray I have some time in the near future to actually implement some of them ...  A scientific career and a family career are taking up a lot of my time at the moment. But I'm sure there will be less busy days that I can sit down and get the new version released.

Cool. If I may go farther out on this limb, what are some other things on your idea list? Unless you're like Watto, keeping features secret until they're released...

Actually I don't keep my upcoming things secret, I do it for a very good reason. If I say something like "Game Extractor 2.0 will have magical powers", then it ties me down to something that I might not be able to do for some reason. For example, I might not be able to do this for a while due to lack of time, or other more important things to implement might come up beforehand. If I lock myself in to adding "magic powers" in the next GE, then I can't really release the next version until that is in it.

Plus, as soon as you say something about an upcoming version, people jsut keep emailing you constantly saying "when will it be ready" - I don't really want that.

So, its not that I want to keep it secret, its actually just for my own benefit. If you dig hard enough, you can probably find my GE ToDo list floating around somewhere, but I always seem to keep adding more things to the list without actually removing anything from it. Ironically, adding the File Cutter into GE is something that I have had on my list for a while, but obviously I havn't done that yet

Well, [viewtopic.php?t=631](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?t=631) is my .plan thread, you can find some ideas there, if and when I post them. But like Watto, I only tell of some of my ideas, but will not promise to have them in the new version, because perhaps I won't have the time. So, I just talk about the things I know for certain that are going to be in the new version, the rest I'll just say that a future version might have it.

i didn't think POPData.bf as "important" enough, as all it contains is DEFAULT settings for controllers etc.

It seems like popdata.bf is a file for platform specific information, like there will be different one depending on the console (PS2, XBOX, PC, etc)
