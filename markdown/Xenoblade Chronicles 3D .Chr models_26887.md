- Post Title: Xenoblade Chronicles 3D .Chr models

I want to see if it were possible to convert the games .chr Model files to .brres or bcres(and maybe back).

the file has some data similar to brres.
the header name is mgbr and the naming is different from the original wii verison.
For example 3ds verison is called oj020001.chr and the wii verison has this same name for the MDL0 model object for the 131133.brres.
MDL0 is also in the .chr file and with other data such as it also says 3D model(NW4R)
(oj020001 is just a basic door, using this just has less data to deal with)

I mainly just want to see the differences between the Wii and 3DS assets and how these models are built for 3DS like polygon count
