- Post Title: Spam(bots) targeting your PM ? Report them here!!

Hello all, 

I've temporarily disabled the forum for new user registration due to a recent spam attack, where spambots target random members with messages in their private messaging box.   

Please report any such spammer to us so we can delete that fucker. You can leave a message here as well. 

Meanwhile, we'll work on a fix. 

Thanks ! 

Mike

Finally  
I've suffered from this.
So, should we mention the names of those accounts here?

Sample picture.

"The requested user does not exist."  I don't think that account exists anymore.

If you have one of these spam PMs, and it's from "Anonymous", the account has already been deleted, and you can delete the PM without reporting it here.

Please report these posts using the "Report this post" button (the one with an ! on it) instead of posting here; this thread is meant to report PM spammers.
