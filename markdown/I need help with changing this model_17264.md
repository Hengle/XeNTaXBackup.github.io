- Post Title: I need help with changing this model

I want to change the solider model and texture of a german soldier. I would love it if would have a swastika ribbon on his left arm, the game doesnt show any swastika symbols sadly.. I would like it because it would make it more fun looking. The files are crn files, could anyone please do this for me? If not, at least telling me how to do that? (every) response is appreciated!
