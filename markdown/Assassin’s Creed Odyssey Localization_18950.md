.bk2 files are Bink (2) video files. Bink is a proprietary video format, therefore, you cannot edit these files.

Yes, Assassin's Creed: Odyssey supports Arabic.

Also, I will look into the subtitle files. As of now, no information is known about any of the game's files.

I found the font file of the assassin's creed origins game. DataPC.forge -> 8-Game Bootstrap Settings.data ->
51-FontManager_0X1A36B0959.1641561018 but when opened with hexeditor only 9 ECA7A670 value.
The lenght of FontManager_0X1A36B0959.1641561018 is 6b3 very short
