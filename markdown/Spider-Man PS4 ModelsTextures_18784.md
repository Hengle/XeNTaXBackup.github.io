- Post Title: Spider-Man PS4 Models/Textures

Spider-Man PS4 just came out yesterday, and I felt like Insomniac's absolutely excellent character models could be put to great use in fan films and artwork. I'm creating this post as a place reverse-engineers can share their research and eventual tools.

Unless you already know, everything that is released for new PS4 firmware can NOT be accessed period, ONLY games up to firmware 5.05 can be dumped off of a PS4, everything released after its pretty much impossible for the public.

What about the sound files?

As for all three of these, you can either submit them to the VG Resource's sites or just do it independently.
