Could someone help me open these linux images? They don't seem to be compressed with the usual g-zip.

according to binwalk theres a gzip section on the rootfs:


1707175   	0x1A0CA7  	Windows CE RTOS
7839098   	0x779D7A  	gzip compressed data, has comment, comment, encrypted, last modified: Wed Oct 14 21:20:02 2026


Anyone know how I can open this?
