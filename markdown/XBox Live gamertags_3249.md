Anyone here have an XBox Live account and care to share it? Mine is (guess what) [Dinoguy1000](http://live.xbox.com/en-US/profile/profile.aspx?pp=0&GamerTag=Dinoguy1000).

Try this (note that it uses the Aero box, since it's just an edited version of mine; and it may not appear correctly until you actually preview your Aero box):

```


Eh? Burnout? I don't have that... And it's been a while since I played DMC4 too... Mirror's Edge has been taking up most of my time recently (as evidenced by my awesome Gamerscore for it), but yesterday I also got back to some of my other games and got some shiny new achievements in two of them.  

I'll add you later if I remember, and if you don't beat me to it.

Eh? No joke, I meant exactly what I said... Squall has already responded to my invite, but (last I checked) you hadn't been on since the 9th. Your invite is still waiting for you.

Ohh, you're squall? I need to pay closer attention to the usernames on posts here...  Evidently, there's someone on Xbox Live with the gamertag [LionheartUK](http://profile.mygamercard.net/LionheartUK), and I guess he isn't you. ^~^

That helps clarify it... The Google thing is the same for me, there's stuff I've registered under with the name Dinoguy1000 that I don't remember anymore because of how long ago it's been, that's how bad I am...
