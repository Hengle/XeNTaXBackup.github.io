- Post Title: [request] noesis script for game assassin obj files

From time to time i'm ripping model from games with game assassin, but for loading ripped model i need to use plugin for 3ds max, but [author's page](http://www.gameassassin.com/downloads.htm) can propose only x86 version and i'm using x64 version of max, and it's really pain in ass installing/loading several 3ds maxs to just import geometry.
so my question is: can you make script for multi-loading (or multi-converting) models in noesis for ripped files (obj)

[i attached](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/9919707/cg.forexperts.ru/forum/extract-3d/infernal-pc/20120221130347.zip) sample of ripped scene, i think noesis should load AutoSave.lst, cause it's list of models and textures.
so without bones, just geometry with textures

Yeah I'm having the same problem as yours. I use Max 2010 x64, and I'm not that arsed to download a never or older version just to make that bloody GA plugin work.

Why dont you combine all these model part into one by Game Assasin and then ripping again by using 3D Ripper DX ?

Remeber that 3D Ripper DX can rip model from GA :d

Have Fun !

I know it's a slightly old topic, but I'd like to add my support to the request for this plugin. I know the potential number of people to use Game Assassin is much larger than the number of people with a x86 MAX version capable of working with the rips. 

Currently I'm using 3D Ripper as described above and it is far from ideal
