I did extract some by myself, but I'm waiting for someone to make a bms script for the .motstm_data files.

How'd you extracted them.

I'm aware predator is allegedly working on a bms script but it appears he went mia for a while

The .motstm_data files and .mot files both have .anm files inside of them, the .mot files have the filenames (EX: "game\pc\pc000501").

Since Predator added support for the .anm files. 

Would you kindly tell me how to extract the Motstm_data acrhives properly? I tried the samples you posted on github I think??? it works.
