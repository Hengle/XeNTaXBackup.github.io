- Post Title: troubles exporting from Noesis to Blender

hello everyone,
I'm trying to export models from Noesis 4.438 to Blender,
the models are .mdlx format (Kingdom Hearts II) and can be correctly imported in Noesis using a plugin by 'revelation',
but when I export the models to .fbx format, and I import them to Blender, I got this glossy effect on every material.
Do you know what is that? and how can I fix that?
thank you

go in to your matrela tab and in the tab you will see node things with gage like things , just turn them down , best to watch a few vids about blender matreals , it would help
