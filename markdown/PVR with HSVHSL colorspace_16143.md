- Post Title: PVR with HSV/HSL colorspace?

Those are some textures that I extracted from Gameloft's game. Seem like they are configured in other colorspace like HSL or HSV, not default RGB because they just have only red, green, yellow, purple color. And I don't know what program can open them or decrypt them completely. Hope you guys can help me.
