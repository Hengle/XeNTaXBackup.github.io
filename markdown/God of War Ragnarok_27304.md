- Post Title: God of War Ragnarok

This is probably last thread i create here on xentax...

God of War Ragnarok tool is in progress. Allows to export characters with bones/weights.
When i usually say "it will be posted here after some testing", now i dont know yet where it can be posted. Probably on my github, or on some new forum, when and if it will be started.

The tool currently relies on Hitmanhimself's tool, so assets must be first exported with his tool, and then converted.







It will also allow to import cutsom models back into game, on PS4 or PS5.
