It contains 584 audios files (FSB4/mp3) with a lot of data at 98% of the file, like:

> V   AMMO_FLARE_3_AVAILABLE    P i c k   u p   3   f l a r e s   AMMO_FLARE_3_SUCCESS    P i c k e d   u p   3   f l a r e s   AMMO_FLARE_5_AVAILABLE    P i c k   u p   5   f l a r e s   AMMO_FLARE_5_SUCCESS    P i c k e d   u p   5   f l a r e s   AMMO_FLAREGUN_AVAILABLE    P i c k   u p   f l a r e   g u n   a m m o   AMMO_FLAREGUN_SUCCESS    P i c k e d   u p   f l a r e   g u n   a m m o   AMMO_REVOLVER_AVAILABLE    P i c k   u p   r e v o l v e r   a m m o
And here it's the full pathname (at offset 02D31430)

I'm very interesting in unpacking archives from this game and converting models. I upload 2 files: [80mb](http://www.sendspace.com/file/quccjh) and [4mb](http://www.sendspace.com/file/xwrtk8).

Savage, maybe you look at them. But i think all models and textures (and it's what i need) are in the big ep001-000.rmdp archive which actually 1 233 149 kb

It seems that now there really is no unpacker for alan wake. I've searched on the internet, but can find only patch solution of the *.rmdp files

Thx. No problem. 

I'll try this out at home. If they made this with hex editor, than might they don't have editor.

The portuguese patch only changes/updates some files, they used xdelta (it's like a diff tool) we need a tool/script to unpack.

Yeah, but the "using patch" is not always equal with "they translated in hex". Just in this case. 

It seems I have to make a tool, because I need to edit the font-image too.

Ok, first release. I tested it on only 3 files, and just extraction supported so far!

Sorry, but because I like to make experiences, the tool is run under [.Net Framework 4.0](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=9cfb2d51-5ff4-4491-b0e5-b386f32c0992&displaylang=en) ONLY!

UPDATE:
I seems, no need to repack the files. If you unpack a bin/rmdp, just rename the bin file, and copy the unpacked files into the data folder of the game. But i'll make repack function, after I can break the compression of the texture files.
Updated tool available from here: [viewtopic.php?f=33&t=8411](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=33&t=8411)

Ok, it's good news  I unpacked biggest file (ep001-000-ru.rmdp) and found binmsh and tex files. I think this models and textures. Now we need script or converter for those files

I'm interested just in the textures because of font files. I think not a converter what we need, but a unpacker/repacker. I think the textures are compressed somehow.
I have now the Xbox 360 SDK, I hope I can find some useful information in there.

All extracted fsb(fsb4) file is a sound file. But no, my tool can't convert them into, for example, wav format. But I think I saw in this forum a quickbms script FSB2Wav converter.

FSB Files Can Be Converted to wav by "FSB Files Extractor (fsbext)" created by Luigi.

to Extract and Convert Sound files of Alan Wake  :
1. Use AlanWTool for extracting FSB files.
2. Use FSBext for converting FSB files to Wav.(without -a)
3. Add Header to Wav fiels.
4. Then Convert them by "Towav".

4. Then Convert them by "Towav".

I tried this method, but had no success.  Then I read some other threads in this forum which mentioned towav can understand some FSB files directly.  So, I gave that a shot, and it worked!  I've only decoded a couple of files so far.  I'll do a quick convert on all of the FSB audio files and spot-check for problems, but I doubt there will be any problems.

EDIT:  Yep, works great.  Basically, using steps 1 and 4 only in the process above will give you the decoded WAV files.

Unfortunately  nothing news. I don't know the 3d model files structure, and I couldn't de-swizzling the basically dds files.

I'm going to upload an updated tool with repacker and text file converter, but that's everything I can do.

I can confirm the tool also works just fine for pc version.

Edit: It extracts some of the files but then stops at the middle of the extraction.

I'm looking for a way to unpack the files and replace the subtitle files with other files (from another package), because I'd like to play this game in english with german subtitles. But the tool here does not work with the PC version of that game. Is there a way to get around this? Couldnt find a single website regarding this topic but this website.

-keksautomat

//Edit
Okay listen. The files are now completed in one file. I mean they are not split up in episode files anymore (epi001-000-*.rmdp etc.) but in complete files (epi999-000-*.rmdp).
So if you rename epi999-000-*.rmdp to epi001-000-*.rmdp it will work with the unpacker.
Just tested it. 

//Edit2
Okay it works with a language file (for example ep999-000-de.rmdp) but not with the main english file (I assume its the original english file) (ep999-000.rmdp).

I don't know what you did or not did, but the tool can unpack the smaller bin/rmdp PC files even without renaming.
Soon I'll update the tool (repack/PC text compatible).

Can't wait for the update to the tool. I really want to remove the completely out of place advertisements that are shoved in our face. Hopefully textures get sorted out shortly after.

all language files extract very well with the tool you made, but it seem to have some issue on the PC version of ep999-000.bin, it crash around 2/3 of the loading extraction bar.

And restarting the soft with the same extracted folder use will freeze the soft and then crash again (I am suspicious the freezing is the process of going through all extracted files, and will crash when ending on the same file as it was with a newly created folder.)

So i am not sure if it's either a corrupted file doing so, or if the soft have an issue with anything else.

I am running Windows 7 64bit, and here the signature if that can help you

```


edit: I think the software crash when the folder is not empty or if the file already exist.
because if you try to extract the bin into a folder with existing files, it just crash right away.

Since they packed all episode in one file and similar path happen, it would crash your tool.

Try to code it in a way if the file exist, just skip.

I think I know why crash: I made this tool for unpack the language files. A biggest language file is 300-400MB, the limit of the tool is ~1.8GB. But than, I'll extend this limit.
The tool overwrite the already unpacked files, or the new repacked bin/rmdp files.

Which tool are you talking about? The one that is added on the first page doesn't extract language files but only textures and sound files. Is there a version that I don't know?

IT's weird, because the tool crash way before you even reach the limit you specified. when i said 1/3, i was more talking about 1/8 when looking properly again.

and at miGma, the tool of the first page, which is the only one on this topic does extract everything.

I noticed the HVK are custom files for the havokengine, they are somehow linked with the datamsh.
I can't seem yet to make any idea how to read the meshes, but it seem they are an encrypted version of what xbox file and havok would look like.

It only extracts sound and textures files when I do.. (only .tex and .fsb files) What's wrong?

What packages are you extracting ? because you have 2~3 of them on the PC version, one have everything, and the second have only sound and textures file.
The biggest in size is the one you want to extract, but you will need to wait on the tool update for that.

In which file are the english text files? (subtitles etc.) I'm extracting ep999-000-en package, aren't the text files in this one? 

And can this tool also import? I mean, evin already sent me the text file and I translated some of it, but I want to try in game. Can I manage it with this tool? Btw I'm talking about PC.

Of course. Would I give you the texts, if there is no chance to repack the text file?
Next week you can test it.

Wait for Evin to raise the memory of his tool, and you will be able to extract it.
This tool wasn't designed to work on one massive huge file since the xbox version was splinted in multiple small ones.
