- Post Title: [PC]Aion Model Files Guide (??)

Hi everyone. I'm pretty sure that some people already know about the MMORPG "Aion", that uses the CryTek 3 Engine. 
The thing is that I extracted all the .pak files from the game already and after doing that I opened the .cgf files (model files) in Noesis. The odd thing is that no matter how many files I kept opening in Noesis, I couldn't find any of the clothes you could purchase, in fact I think I only recall finding some basic armors (3 to be specific.)
Could you guys please help me with this thing D: I've already asked to other people in sites like deviantART how they managed to get their files, but they refuse to help and pretty much say "Ask somebody else".
Edit: btw, im using the na client.
Thanks in advance.
