- Post Title: (Unity) Kingdom Hearts Melody of Memory Animation Extraction

Does anyone know how to properly rip animations from Unity Games? when I export from Asset Studio, most of the models are on frame 1 of their animation, and trying to open the asset file in Unity Asset Bundle Extractor doesn't work, if anyone could help, that'd be greatly appreciated.

Here's the link to the file from the game: [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-z6WZA ... sp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-z6WZAXPHflyX9AR3SeyLXHnSleYT0YA/view?usp=sharing)
you can decompress it with UABE, but then opening the decompressed files don't work.
