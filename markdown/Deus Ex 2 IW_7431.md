Curious - has anyone ever managed to convert IW models. I've tried crawling the net around, but sadly wasn't able to find anything that could help me.
Uh in case someone has a clue - included one of the models.
It ought to be a UE2 derivative game, though it's apparently fairly different from the standard.

[s]okay did some extra digging around, and it would seem that the textures are in these, so it's certainly quite possible that the meshes are there as well.

EDIT
the IBD is just a texture package. But goddamn I want to know why the person who worked on the engine modified so much of it. Not to mention the editor as well.

It aparently loads both PSK and PRO files but has no standard UnrealED features  from which one could export it. Or a conversion between the two.
