- Post Title: LPCM file from a PAM file (PS3)

As you can see Celestial Being can demux PAM files, not all of them completely yet but at least some progress is made, thanks to cozy, watson (both from PSPRipkits) and Alphatwentythree.

Now I got another problem, an lpcm file I got from a PAM, I've tried lpcm24.exe, towav.exe, eac3to, goldwave and even hexedit but nothing yet; I get some parts of the audio correctly but the rest is noise.  

Help is appreciated.

Thanks in advance

EDIT:  Aerodinamica, the audio encoder at Celestial Being solved it yesterday.  So I muxed the video from movadvertise.pam (movadvertise.m2v and movadvertise.lpcm [Converted to movadvertise.wav] into mkv)
