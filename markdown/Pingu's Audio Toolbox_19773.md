- Post Title: Pingu's Audio Toolbox

Hey all! Thought I'd create this as a host to put all of my research projects. This will mainly be composed of audio research (as that is what my emphasis has lately been a part of). As of right now, I don't have much to post, so within the next few days I will begin to host research . 
Games will be categorized by file types (ie. Archives, Images, etc.) and will be written using the following convention:

```
"GAME NAME (Category Type)[Platform Specific? List Them.]"
```


Tools required to use these scripts:

Aluigi's QuickBMS: [http://aluigi.altervista.org/quickbms.htm](http://aluigi.altervista.org/quickbms.htm)
foobar2000 and the vgmstream component: [https://www.foobar2000.org/](https://www.foobar2000.org/) The vgmstream component can be found under the "Components" section on the main website.

Note! To use the get the audio to play properly in foobar, simply drag and drop the *.txth into the folder where the samples were extracted to. You should be able to then drag and drop the samples onto foobar and they should play fine.


Enjoy!
