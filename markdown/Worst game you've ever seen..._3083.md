I'll take a peek when I get home from work. Firewalls and security settings prevent me from looking at it now.

take a peek is the best thing you can do since you can't really do much with it anyway...
this really was just a test game to see if I can get the hang of the basic features of AGS, I just followed their tutorial, I would delete it but I uploaded it for safekeeping just in case...and then I thought I'd just share it.
