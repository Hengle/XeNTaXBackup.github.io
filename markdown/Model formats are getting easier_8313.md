- Post Title: Model formats are getting easier?

So I've been looking at a lot of PC games and find that MMO's and other PC games tend to have...pretty simple model formats.
It looks like a lot of PS3 and 360 games have been getting out as well.

Then I see games for PSP, PS2, and PS1...and those generally come with all sorts of headaches.
And then the older consoles.......lol

How come it seems like things are getting easier as newer stuff comes out compared to old stuff?

more people are using pre canned things instead of trying wierd things they used to have to do to squeeze extra performance out of games.

Getting "easier" because a lot of the constraints that were present on older systems are no longer a concern for developers.  Blu-ray discs can hold many times more than a cd/dvd, 512 megs of ram is a lot more than the ps1/2 had, etc. Combined with the fact that the hardware accepts data in formats that are a lot more general and not solely specific to the platform in question, and developers do not have to use as many tricks as they used to have to do to save on space or cater to the peculiar ways to gain extra speed out of a system.  Faster read/access times, quicker memory transfers, larger storage devices,, more powerful processors, and APIs designed after those found on average computer platforms (Direct3D, OpenGL, etc.) all allow for avoiding complicating data, unless they really want to for whatever reason.  Now they have new areas of concern for performance improvements and graphical enhancements, etc.

Pre canned like chrrox said.
Before everyone had to write their own game engine, so formats were designed for the engine.
Modern games are based on generic game engines so the format is similar/identical for alot of games.

Seems to be a affecting the trend in jobs advertised as well.
They used to want programmers, artists, modelers, etc, but I see more and more companies wanting "multi skilled" people.
Doesn't really take that much effort to write a game these days, just throw everything at a game engine, you've noticed how bloated in size those korean games are. 
Have you noticed that some models appear in more than one game?
Have you noticed games have become increasingly boring?
People still hand over their money though.....
