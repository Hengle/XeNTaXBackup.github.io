Hey. I think I need a bit of help. 

I want to be able to use textures in the smackdown vs raw 2010 video game. 

I have brough the XPort 360 device that is needed, I've downloaded the modio thing that is needed and paint.net aswell. I've also downloaded PT Explorer 1.6 that was attatched to somebodys post at the bottom of page 11 in the SVR2010 topic.

I downloaded it, unzipped it and now when I try to open the program I get this error come up:

I have asked various members over on the caws.ws forum about this problem and they have told me to come over here and ask for help on here. They say that it should be quite an easy fix but I have no idea!

Please help!

Try right-clicking and Troubleshoot COmpatibility, then select XP SP2 mode.

It worked! Cheers for the help. I've got everything running and I'm making use of all this stuff. This can be closed now.
