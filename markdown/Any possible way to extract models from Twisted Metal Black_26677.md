- Post Title: Any possible way to extract models from Twisted Metal: Black?

I used Ninja Ripper on PCSX2, but I was able to extract just the textures. I tried using the program's screenshot feature, but I only got triangles and other absurdly distorted geometric shapes. A guy once got it with the screenshot feature, but I didn't understand how.
