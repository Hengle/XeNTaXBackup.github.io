I can play it perfectly (violins and orchestrial), I use mplayer.

you need to use a player that supports the Microsoft ADPCM codec like mplayer/mencoder/ffmpeg.

no idea.
the only thing I have been able to see is that loading it as raw pcm big endian is better than little endian (note the pauses between the sounds) but I don't think this helps.
