- Post Title: thaw to thug2 file format

so I've attached a tont hawk american wasteland and tony hawks underground 2 level files. I'm trying to figure out how to convert the thaw files into thug2 file format. Notice thug2 files are scn.xbx which is what i want my thaw files to be, they're currently just .xbx.
