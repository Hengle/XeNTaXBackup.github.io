- Post Title: Dark Cloudfiles; looking into them and extracting/opening

So, I recently found an extractor for Dark Cloud, a game for the PS2 released back in 2001. I realized the files in the characters folder have the .chr format; but 3DS 2010 can't open them. I want these open! I'm assuming they use some sort of compression, but that is a mystery to me for now. There is some modding potential with the files, since there is an unpacker/repacker; but first I am asking for help with this. Anyone who knows the basic layout of most PS2 files will be a big help.

If you want a copy of any of the files, you may PM me for a file.

[The Extractor/Compacter is here.](http://forum.xentax.com/blog/wp-content/plugins/download-protect/downloader.php?d=%93%E9%C5%D3%9A%9D%EA%D8b%AF%CF%B3%AA%AB%D7%A2%DC%C6%D9%9A%D4%D9a%9C%D6%B1f%9D%D3%E5%D9%CE%9A%88%DF%D0%9Ah%DE%B4d%9A%D3%E1%D8%C6%D9%9A%A2%D6%A3%A5%D6%A5%9B%AA%93%DF%CD%C8%D3%9A%D2%D8%9B%A2%DB%A9%9A%A3%D3%E8%C8%8F%E5%8F%E3&v=%D4%E5%CD%D7%CC%9A%D8)

The samples you sent me are blank files.
Ma-bee the extractor posted is wrong.

Found files that actually have stuff in them! They are labeled ".mds" And are in folders usually labeled with the character's name. *Facepalm* Do you want a sample of these Chrrox?

OK, I figured out why the files I had were empty.

Ready?

It was because I forgot to get the data.dat file from the game as well.

*FACEPALM*

I assure you, this time, ALL of the bytes are there.
