So I am not asking for someone to do this (but that would be totally cool) I just want to know if it is even possible. The game came out not a long time ago, but is it possible to extract the models from this game yet? If so, I will find a way to do so. If I can figure out how to extract these models, it will help me a lot for my website! If not, I'll have to extract from the other games.

I take a look at the demo, which have a different structure from Naruto S.N. Storm2 ones. 
If i understood well,  3dmodels should be set in .cpk archives this time. 
I found some npd3 files there, but i spent a very little time on it. 
Probabably some more experienced people could help you.

yes I have seen the .cpk files as well, but have not done anything to them. I'm not sure how to go about extracting the 3d models from them. Hopefully someone who knows will find this forum and explain how to go about doing this.

How is this going!? Im doing the exact same project, I got the iso and extracted it and now I see the .cpk etc but from my searching currently there is no way to open this games .cpk files as of yet. I REALLY want these models so I can use them in a mod on a couple of other games.

This tool is compatible with NSUNS3 Demo:

Hopefully the full game is going to be compatible with extractor.

Are you sure those are models??

Because not all the xfbins are models or packed textures.

First you need to be sure that the out xfbins files are models.

I get some errors with some models but it has nothing to do with my tool is just noesis things.

The unpacker is ps3 and x360 compatible but you need to follow the instructions.

Has anyone had a problem with the textures? Everytime I export the models from noesis, the textures get messed up and are not in the right spots. And some of the models wont even load because they are so bad. Does anyone know how to fix this?

Here is an example:

I've had some luck finding the models I was looking for but they all look very 'flat' texture-wise when I extract them... how did you manage to keep the cel shaded look?

That's a simple render in 3ds max. Just add a faloff shader in the selfillumination stack, in the falloff type choose choose shadow/light and in the mix curve trace something like this:



For the outline, just duplicate your mesh, go to your modifier stack and choose normal modifier and then flip (you can do the same in your edit mesh). After that just add a push modifier and play with the values (normally negative values) to determinate the thickness of the line you want, and finallym apply a black color and you're done.
