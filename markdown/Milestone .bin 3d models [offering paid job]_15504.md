- Post Title: Milestone .bin 3d models [offering paid job]

Dear community,
I am a diehard MotoGP fan. However, the modding community is limited by Milestone non-support for mods.  

aluigi and others provided tools for archives (.mix format). We (modders) have made giant steps forward over the years.

However, the .bin archive for 3d models inside the .mix archives cannot be edited with any available tool as of now.


I am willing to pay for a tool that lets me extract and repack the .bin 3d model archives. I know it takes time to create one, and since nobody has done it for free, maybe they will do it formoney.

Here is an example .bin file of a track (circuit), if someone wants to test it out..
It's from the game "Valentino Rossi The Game"

 I am looking for serious people, which I know Xentax is full of.

Please let me know below if you have any question.

```
-They contain multiple 3d objects
-They contain UV maps

(There's also an FVFsize of 40 to be found in the bin file.)

 My main concern is not only extracting models, but repacking them as well.

So, you could: extract the model or a piece-->edit it-->reimport it back.

Your tool is very nice, hopefully you can it further, I would pay hourly for your job.

I don't have many hopes left

Just a thought, v2 derivatives of 3DSimED would import earlier versions of bin files.

Maybe if you asked nicely in the support forum the creator would look into supporting bin files again in the latest version.
