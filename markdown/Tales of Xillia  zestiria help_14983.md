- Post Title: Tales of Xillia / zestiria help

Hi all, I new to this community - I'm just trying to get some static models from the tales of series. I managed to use the quickbms script to extract the files and now I'm left with a ton of .dat files. So I'm feeling pretty good, until I attempt to open them in Noesis. Noesis can't seem to preview any of the files. I tried giving it a few plugins such as lithTech dat66 / 85 / 86, but still nothing. Any suggestions? I understand that .dat files are another form of compression; do I have to decompress it at this point before I can view any of them?

Thank you!
