- Post Title: p3d files

Hello! This is the first time I am writing in here, and I would like to ask for some help on Popcap's P3D files. I honestly have found no programs that can open it, I am not even sure if they can be opened by any known programs. Can anyone help me with the filetype and maybe open it? I provided an p3d example below. Also if it helps here is how a p3d file looks like when opened by hex editor.
