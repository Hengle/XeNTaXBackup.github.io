- Post Title: Shadow Complex Remastered Localization Font Type?

I translate the file "Shadow Complex Remastered\EmpireGame\Localization\INT\EmpireGame.int" but I did not solve the end of the font and I have edited the game's own font file "Shadow Complex Remastered\EmpireGame\Localization\INT\GOTHMMED.TTF", the problem still continues. 

Anybody help me in this problem please...
