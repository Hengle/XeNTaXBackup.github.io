- Post Title: Harry Potter 5 and 6 (str shd ffs)

Hello.
I have extract all .big files of "Harry Potter and the order of phoenix" and "Harry Potter and the half blood prince" with QuickBMS.

There are now .str .shd and .ffs files. I don't know how I can open these files 
I have found a folder that is called "head_models".

Screenshot of that folder:


Do somebody know how to extract/decrypt however one of these files to get the 3D model (maybe the textures too) ?

Sorry for my bad english ...


Here is a rar file with a shd, ffs and str file in it.
Just click on download (the website is completly free)
