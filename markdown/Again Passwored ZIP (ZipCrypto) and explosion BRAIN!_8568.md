- Post Title: Again Passwored ZIP (ZipCrypto) and explosion BRAIN!

Tera launcher contained inside exe passwored zip. I get ZIP and valid password but fails to unpack all files.

```
app.config.xml.erb
```


Extracted without problems. I thought that here the same method as in [Eligium](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=7895) (for each file a different password).
1 hour debugging and except this 0sg$!tt6Qv1v password did not find anything else. Can some one help?

the executable doesn't work since remain freezed.

anyway if you have found that password the others should be enough close to it.
find all the occurrencies of that string and check the memory around it
