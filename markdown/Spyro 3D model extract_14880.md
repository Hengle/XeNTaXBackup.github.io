- Post Title: Spyro 3D model extract

I downloaded the archive to the game The Legend of Spyro: Dawn of the Dragon, unpacked, but I do not know how to get the model, I even have no idea what to look for in the file.

Please help, I am trying to get the year of the dragon Spyro model of the game The Legend of Spyro: Dawn of the Dragon.

Which version do you have? I believe this forum already has existing techniques to rip models from PS3 games. Those for PS2 are kind of tricky since there isn't a way to neatly rip them.

Can't help with extracting, but this place has quite a few dragon models from the game:
