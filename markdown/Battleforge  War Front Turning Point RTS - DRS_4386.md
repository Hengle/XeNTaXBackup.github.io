Thank you for asking.
Maybe the War front, exe file (so I could see all of the headings like DPOS which begins every vertex array) and maybe every file realting to the flying green dragon/bird from battle forge because I want to see where the texture coordinates are stored.

The BF files first, the dragons didn't have any names, and there were several green-ish dragons in the archives. Plus, they all seem to somewhat share the same assets for several of them, due to the animations and Texture UV layout, although I could be wrong. So, sorry for the large file size.

Uploaded an extra set of different files from WF:TP and the Executable. Hope this helps.

Once again, thanks for the time taken mate, much appreciated.
