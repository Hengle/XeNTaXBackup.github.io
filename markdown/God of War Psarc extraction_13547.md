- Post Title: God of War Psarc extraction

Hi, total noob here, im trying to extract the psarc files for god of war III, ascension, and the hd collection for 1 and 2. none of the methods iv'e found have worked, psarc.exe gave me an invalid header error message. ps3 tools failed entirely. and psarc gui was the same. just can't seem to get them open. in trying to get my hands on the audio (music and dialogue) and the video (cutscenes).
can anyone help me figure this out?

Edit: the exact error message was  
Psarc error: Invalid header (Bad magic number 0xe9359ff5)

which is odd because someone else did this exact same thing, same files, same game and it worked fine here

also does anyone have the  version of psarc.exe that supports both zlib and lzma

your psarc must be broke, because i already have modified the file a lot of times and always have worked for me.

Is it possible that this is a windows 8.1 issue? because i just copied the file right from the game disc..
how do I get the files from my disc to my computer without messing them up, so I can extract them?

i don't think so, 

i believe that your file must be the problem, 
try to download a " shared " file from the game.

You mean like from a torrent or something?
