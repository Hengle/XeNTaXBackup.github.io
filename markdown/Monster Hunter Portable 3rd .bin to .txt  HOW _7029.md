Just use my tool: [https://github.com/codestation/mhtools](https://github.com/codestation/mhtools)

You can use it to extract the data.bin files from an already translated game, extract the string tables, continue translating, rebuild them and even encrypt them back. After that you can make your own script to rebuild the data.bin or patch the data.bin file with the individual files after calculating the offset. There is a option to generate a patchfile to use with my patchers if you want to.

Yes, compile it all in a jar then use the command line (you could create some bat files to save some typing).

Hi, i tried to extract the quests but i got invaild file size error every time, what can i do? it was a newer data.bin.
There is no .mib file in it so i tried to use the --extract-quests command for the 2819.bin
