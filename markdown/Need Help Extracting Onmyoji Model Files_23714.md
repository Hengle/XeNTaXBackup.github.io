- Post Title: Need Help Extracting Onmyoji Model Files

I want to extract some models from the game to use to animate, but I don't know how. I know I need things called "npk" files, however I'm not sure how to get those from Onmyoji. (not Onmyoji Arena).

the big problem, model and textures not connected, 
So for 1 model you have to find a suitable texture among thousands of textures from the game manually

yes, I'm aware of that. I just don't know where to find an APK for the game that doesnt lead to some site that has a trojan or malware on it.
