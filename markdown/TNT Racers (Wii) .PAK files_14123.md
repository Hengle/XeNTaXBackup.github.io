- Post Title: TNT Racers (Wii) .PAK files

I recently extracted files from the WiiWare game TNT Racers through ShowMiiWads, and one of the extracted files (00000002.app) has, inside it, two .pak files: data.pak and streamed_data.pak, 30.1MB and 5.64MB, respectively.

How can I extract these? 'Cause these .pak seem to differ from other types of .pak I've seen.

For reference, they were extracted from the US version.
