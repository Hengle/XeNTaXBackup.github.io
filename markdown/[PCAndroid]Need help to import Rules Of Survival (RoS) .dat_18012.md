- Post Title: [PC/Android]Need help to import Rules Of Survival (RoS) .dat

Hi guys,

I've been wondering on how to convert the .dat files to any common format such as .obj / .fbx.
I've tried the disunity software also but failed. Does anyone has any clue on how to convert this .dat file from
RoS Online?

I've attached samples of the extracted file from .npk

Thanks
