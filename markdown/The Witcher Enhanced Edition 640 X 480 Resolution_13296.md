Hi,

I am trying to configure TWEE (1) to run in 640 X 480 resolution. This is what I have tried till date:
1. Reg edit: The game setting are stored in a registry. Tried changing the Height and Width params but the game resets the same to native resolution when started

2. Hex edit: Checked for hex values of resolution in .exe and .dlls. Nothing found

3. Luc files: I think there's this .luc file hwdepsettings.luc (/System/Scripts) which forces resolutions >= 800, 600. Used luadec .6 to decompile the same but I guess the source code generated doesnt make sense at many places. I don't have any exposure to .lua but the stuff doesn't make sense at many places. I also tried hex editing the 800 to 640 and 600 to 480, somehow that too isn't working

Would be grateful for your guidance.

Best regards.

You need to provide more details. What is your OS? Why do you want to run it on 640x480? Which version do you have? Steam? GOG?  etc.

Background: Witcher doesn't have a 640 X 480 res. Doesn't work below 800X600

O/S: Win 7 64b HP
Game: TWEE Retail North American version
I avoid high res due to eyestrain- play on a 17inch CRT
Have started playing the game but have stopped in between on account of the same. The problem is very minor at 800X600 but 90 hrs of gameplay will have some lasting impact
