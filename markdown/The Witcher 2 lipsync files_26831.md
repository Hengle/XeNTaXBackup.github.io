- Post Title: The Witcher 2 lipsync files

Has anyone looked at The Witcher 2's lipsync files? According to the Redkit wiki the developers used HKX files for it. They never ended up supporting generating custom lipsync with Redkit as they basically abandoned the tool after releasing it.

HKX is a Havok file format. So I'm wondering if Havok's tools supported lipsync and if CD Projekt just used a default Havok utility for lipsync? TW3 has custom Lipsync tools so I'm wondering if those would just work with TW2. 

Any insight you guys might have into HKX files would be great as I'm wondering the best possible course to generate custom lipsync for the game as it would really help its modding community.
