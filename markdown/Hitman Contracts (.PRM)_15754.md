The code from John "Cryect" Rittenhouse works on Blood Money PRM files, but not Contracts PRM files.

Would someone be able to rewrite the code for use on Hitman Contracts PRM files?

Contracts format is heavily different. There's no use for this code.

In near future I'm going to make tools for all hitman games. Almost finished 1st. [viewtopic.php?f=16&t=15695](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=15695)
Silent ass. will be next and its format is the same as contracts.

p.s. Can you remove that code from here?

By the way, does anyone know how they create those converters? I really wanna learn those stuff to mod games and so on.
