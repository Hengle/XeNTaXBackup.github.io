Sorry if there is something on TMNT BF files already but I couldn't get any of the BF stuff to open them. Which includes Rahly's extractor. They must have changed to compression from Beyond Good and Evil and the Prince of Persia stuff.




P.S. Everytime I run MC32.exe Turbotax starts installing. I have to cancel about a half dozen times before tax deduction and Turbo stop trying to install. Then Mex starts as normal. Must have a file association to MC32 in the Turbotax registry.

Damn, what a coincidence.
