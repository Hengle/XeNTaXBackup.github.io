- Post Title: .wft encrypted/compressed files

Hello can somebody tell me what compression/encryption it is used in .wft exported (locked) files.
I've done some research and came to conclusion that it is encrypted via encryption methods described here
[http://www.gtamodding.com/index.php?title=Cryptography](http://www.gtamodding.com/index.php?title=Cryptography)

And i even extracted the key(cypher text from) gtaiv.exe (needed for decrypting)

If someone can take even a small look or give me a hint i will be grateful.

Thanks

Both files are Zlib compressed and can be unpacked without any problems.
Didn't use the cryptokey at all. However, i dont know a program that can read the files unpacked

Zmodeler can view .wft files

The locked_unpacked should be equal to unlocked file 
So i am sceptic that it uses zlib

Thanks

It uses zlib, a zlib decompressor depacked those files for me. So zmodel can depack zlib.

Yes but it zmodeler2.exe also uses crypto library.
Can you make it import to zmodeler 2?

A locked .wft to import to zmodeler 2.

I beg you like a god..

You want to import mod for GTA IV?
Mod files are blocked because of model thefts 
The same situation is in GTA SA and NFS MW

Ah, well I did a little research of my own, Engineer, because you were too eager to get this topic back to where nfsx left off, and you showed similar behaviour. Guess what I found? You know what I found already because I was chatting with you just a few minutes ago on MSN. 

Here's the log:

```
 Hi nfsx, you are banned ... again.. 
Engineer says:
 I am not nfsx
 =)
 Get your facts right first  
 And i dont think it is wise to be threating to me  
Mr.Mouse says:
 Ah, well, in that case, would you care to explain why your MSN login email address matches exactly the one this "nfsx" person that was banned used when registering at our board?
Engineer says:
 Couse i like nfs?
 You do know what NFS is
 NEED FOR SPEED ,mike
Mr.Mouse says:
 Hmm, so you are saying there can be two nfsx-design@hotmail.com addresses? 
Engineer says:
 Hey your name is Mike like that Mike that robed me yesterday so you are the one ,yeah!
 So you check if two user's are the same by email?
 Wow!
 And not by ip  
 Some Admin you are  
Mr.Mouse says:
 Indeed, I made a clear mistake there. I should have IP-banned you in the first place. But I corrected it now. 
Engineer says:
 SOCKS5 baby
 SOCKS5
 Dynamic IP is a magic thing  
 Good luck with IP ban xD
Mr.Mouse says:
 Hmm, I have a feeling we will find you again, and again. 
Engineer says:
 HAHAHAHA
 try  
 I dont give a shit about that forum
 Ban yourself while you are at it
Mr.Mouse says:
 That's okay. We don't feel bad if you do not like us. No harm done there. 
Engineer says:
 and .wft unlocker has been made
Mr.Mouse says:
 Good for you. 
Engineer says:
 Anything else?
Mr.Mouse says:
 Nope, we end here. 
Engineer says:
 Great
Mr.Mouse says:
 Have a good one. 
Engineer says:
 No thanks 

```


And so ends another episode in the story of nfsx that became an Engineer. Will he be back? Tune in next time, folks!

You know, it is a pity. He has registered here under three names now, Decryptor (thanks Dinoguy for that find), nfsx and Engineer. I was willing to help him with his efforts, but he seems very impatient. He has already pissed off others apparently. [http://forum.cgpersia.com/f27/what-ever ... ave-15777/](http://forum.cgpersia.com/f27/what-ever-happened-dave-15777/)

He should lighten up.

Well, I guess it was him that was asking for help on IM yesterday.  He said that you told him to ask me for help, which I kind of doubt after reading this, but I am not helping anyone with this anymore, since I found out about how he was a dick to you.  

I hope people read my last sentence, if they even can, because if I get anymore IMs about this format, which to be honest, I could care less about, I will end up blocking them, unless they quit bugging me for help on it.  

BTW, from my initial analysis of the locked and un-locked files, you gotta be kidding me that nobody can unlock them easily.  I'm pretty sure there are people that can, but those that can, wouldn't want to give the means or knowledge to those that can't, and I can see why in this case.

- Post Title: .wft encrypted/compressed files

This whole Forza and NFS car modelling community seems to exist of a lot of dicks that come here to fight. Sure, there will be honest and decent people there, but the ones that come over here have a high percentage of people that troll and misbehave. They seek help, and then go back to their own community to boast how good they are, probably. Don't know about you, but I'm fed up with that. If I find anyone here wanting a tool to unlock any custom model from any racing game, I'll instaban em. It's the only way to be sure.

Perhaps it would simply be better to be sure to document these formats as quickly and thoroughly as possible on the wiki, and if anyone comes by looking for info on a format we've already cracked, point them to the wiki and ignore any other requests they may have (and if they're looking specifically for a tool to work with the files, be sure to say "not from us, the info's on the wiki, so find someone else to write it").

Just thinking out loud...

Sorry guys, but because I didn't understood what happened. What is the final result, can we open locked wft files or no?

so um how do you open or use the file UnLocked_unpacked.bin? I tried to use power iso or magic iso but none can open it something about file format is invalid or unsupported i would like to unlock a .mesh or a .wdd file....

why? you might ask will I would like to learn not steal from the model you see I use a program call zbrush and it lets you do this thing called retopology its like a blue print of the model and makes you learn how to model 3d better or at least that how I use
