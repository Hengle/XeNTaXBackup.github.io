- Post Title: Counter-Strike: Online .pak files

Hi, Counter-Strike: Online (Nexon) has been using a .nar file format since its release and we have been able to decompress the files thanks to CSOTools made by Da_FileServer. However, today's update brought a new file format named .pak. I've already tried using the same decryption algorithm (to see if it was the same but with a different file format), but didn't work. Then I tried to use some old .pak extractors that were used to extract .pak in Doom/Quake/Half-Life's days, but to no avail. So here I am to ask if you could help me decrypt these files.

Here's some samples:

Thank you for your help in advance!

Edit: I'll also leave here their updated file archive dll - [https://anonfiles.com/9bPfDcx0pe/FileSystem_Nar_dll](https://anonfiles.com/9bPfDcx0pe/FileSystem_Nar_dll)

Hi, I'm new here and not sure if this is the right place. Yesterday, Counter-Strike Online has changed their compression file from .nar to .pak. If anyone's able to help me to find/make an extractor, please do so. I'm in dire need to extract the file for the wiki. Thanks in advance. Here is the sample .pak file.

Yes, here are some samples:

[https://anonfiles.com/t6N9R110p7/na_00000_pak](https://anonfiles.com/t6N9R110p7/na_00000_pak) | This is probably the same as cstrike_na_en.nar
[https://anonfiles.com/10NfR51epc/na_en_00000_pak](https://anonfiles.com/10NfR51epc/na_en_00000_pak) | This is probably the same as cstrike_na.nar

I can't seem to download them - it keeps pushing me to download some browser plugin.

folder with all *.pak-files from Steam version of CS online (Cs nexon studio) - it is same game, but with not-asian localizations
[https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/ ... sp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1E3zCjqrB6UjO3m_GQRxyFrE9mr6CecxX?usp=sharing)

i think this *.pak files contains some *txt-files, some *tga pictures and another files like old *.nar archives.

Also added subfolder to same files from chineese version of cs online

So to confirm, Counter-Strike Online and Counter-Strike Nexon Studio are essentially the same game? Are there any changes?

[https://gitlab.com/an-cso-projects/cso- ... -extractor](https://gitlab.com/an-cso-projects/cso-cpp-pak-extractor) and or [https://git.sr.ht/~leite/cso-pak](https://git.sr.ht/~leite/cso-pak) apparently can extract these files.
