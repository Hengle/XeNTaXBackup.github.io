- Post Title: Need help extracting voices from The Witcher 3 (.w3speech?)

I was able to extract some sound effects using QuickBMS and [this guide for SW:TOR](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?p=66311&sid=94de722e2842869af2f4141f3bb82e2f#p66311) but found the .cache files don't contain the voices. Realized they are actually in the enpc.w3speech files. I searched around and couldn't find anything on the file type. Anyone know how to do this extraction? Thank you.
