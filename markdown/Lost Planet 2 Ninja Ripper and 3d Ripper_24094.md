- Post Title: Lost Planet 2 Ninja Ripper and 3d Ripper?

I know this is a long shot since the game is so old, but I'm running into a problem when trying to use ninja ripper or 3d ripper on Lost Planet 2. The steam version requires that you start the game through the launcher instead of using the direct x9 or x11 exe. This is a problem because both ninja ripper and 3d ripper require the game exe as the target and not the launcher exe. Trying to start the game through the direct x9 or 11x exe or targeting them in the program will cause windows to show the error code 80070002. Any responses would be appreciated. Thanks.
