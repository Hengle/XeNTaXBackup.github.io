The .j3d file contain the following data blocks:

VERTICES
VALUES
POINTS
VECTORS
RGBS MATERIALS
TRIANGLES
BONES


If I use the VERTICES datas I will get the real (good) point positions.
Unfortunately if I use the TRIANGLES datas (as simple triangles) on it I will get a totally wrong mesh.

I don't know how can I build the real mesh from these datas.

(I don't have an installed D.H. 2005.)

Falo,

You are fantastic...
If I skip the two longs (2*4 bytes) before every faces, I will get a correct mesh.

I am sorry for my slow response, but I have a full-time job (non 3d related).

Thank you for the new .j3d sample package. I modified my .j3d loader module a little bit, because I did find some interest situation that your first sample file does not contain.
I will release the new 3D Object Converter update as soon as possible.

I note the script (by Falos) does not work on all models.

Today I released the 3D Object Converter v4.410 update at 13:30.

You can install the V4.40 or use the V4.40 portable version.

You can update your installed application (version>=4.0) quickly and easily using the auto-update function (Help/Check for updates).

after upgrading it works to view the models but nothing more.. I can not edit the models so far I see in your software, I am using 3dsmax 5 and those models need to be converted to *.max files for 3ds max 5 but this is not possible I think on your program .. ¿

I think the best export format is the Wavefront's .obj/mtl format. The game modders (and others) using this format to import the (fully textured) objects into other 3d modeling programs like 3D Studio Max, Cinema 4D, Maya, etc.

I can't support the .max format, because it it totally unpublished.

If you send me ( [kz_3d@tvn.hu](mailto:kz_3d@tvn.hu) ) some (.zip packed) sample files I will convert these files to .obj/mtl format and I will send back to you the converted files to check out the results.
