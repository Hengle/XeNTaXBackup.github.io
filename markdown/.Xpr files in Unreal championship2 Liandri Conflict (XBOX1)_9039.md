- Post Title: .Xpr files in Unreal championship2: Liandri Conflict (XBOX1)

Greeting to all of you. I was interested in to find a way to extract the models in this game(UC2:Liandri conflict), but I couldn't find a tool that opens this type of Xpr files(somehow are diferents compared with the Xpr files in DOA2U, DOA3 and Soul Calibur 2).

So, I was wondering do you know someway to open these files and extract its content??.

Thanks for your attention.
