- Post Title: Where can I learn how to build Proxy .DLL and wrappers?

I want to learn how to build proxy .dlls so I can learn how functions in certain "Dead" games work. Can someone point me in the right direction? Im actually not a great coder so im going to be learning as time goes along with this, id rather have someone give me a link on where I can learn rather then just explaining.
