(Since this is the onyl DKR thread, afaics, I post here instead of opening a new one.)

well, sorry for the late reply. Plus, that mcr script has 770 lines - would require too much effort to check it.

In fact using hex2obj is easier (for me, result from August 2021):

Seems like the importer for the .bdae files is for GT Racing 2, as far as I know bdae files vary from game to game and so the one linked in the OP won't work for TDKR game. I don't think anyone has managed to decode the bdae format for TDKR yet, not that I found anyway. If anyone wants to take a look at the bdae files for the game I've attached a sample here:
