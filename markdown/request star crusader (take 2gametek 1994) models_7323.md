- Post Title: request: star crusader (take 2/gametek 1994) models?

Hello to all, newcommer starlord here!

I hope not to intrude on you, but I would very much like to know if it is possible to extract the ship models from that old DOS game: I seem to remember darkfox has discovered many things regarding this (along with sinistar: unleashed and starmageddon) but he has not replied yet!

I know from some creators of the game that they were made with the first version of 3d studio (likely .3DS). We would need the models for a total conversion project and that would be a definite time saver (instead of having to rebuild them).

Awaiting your advice!

many thanks.

starlord.

Well, these were interests of mine as well but never got any help regarding them. I suppose given their age they are not easily viewed?

Regardless, here's the post with examples of the model format:

I never got far with the formats and apparently the textures are compressed.

thank you for your reply!

I guess textures would be borked anyway if converted, Yet is there a way to extract them? Are they all stored in a same location? Did you try this?

As I said, My primary interest would be to extract the ships and reuse the models (even if they are primitive). Do you see this as possible? If so, which software do you recommend?

Sorry! Many questions in this one, but for once I can talk with someone who knows precisely what game I'm referring to!

Awaiting your advice.

best regards.

P.S: I see you have extracted the entity, which is instrumental for us! Could you theoretically extract all the models?

Actually, yes. =D

[viewtopic.php?f=15&t=2011](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=15&t=2011)

Here's the means to extract the files. Maybe a QuickBMS version can be made? A thing to keep in mind is that there are no extensions, these are assigned by the game itself so would be hard to work in.

wait, so let me get this straight:

the models are .GL format, correct? yet I thought this had been done with 3d studio max? Logically wouldn't they be .3DS?

Could they be converted and extracted in that format? could the textures somehow follow?

Also, was it the dragon unpacker that allowed you to extract those 3 models? Should you have the time, would you consider to extract more if not all? There must be around 40. (should you not have the time, I'll understand!).

Also, what format are the models you extracted (like the entity and the POD)?

Many thanks for your help.

Many thanks! I'll see what we can do with this!

additionnally, as my PM stated, it could be possible I also asked you at some point what you discovered in your tinkering with sinistar: unleashed and starmageddon... That is also of interest to us!

In the meantime, many thanks for the file and help!

No progress on Sinistar Unleashed, but I hope somebody with knowledge of 3D models may take a look into it and this. I believe they are skeletal models in Sinistar Unleashed unlike these which are shapes.

The textures used by Star Crusader is compressed in an unknown way but may relate to TGA, but that is pure speculation. There also runs the risk that Star Crusader's models AND textures are compressed.

In any case, if you or others have success in these, please share.

I actually know the creator of the S:U models! I can link him to you should you wish: He could provide you with information!

just have him give you the model format specs and post them here.

I've sent him an email about it, but in the meantime, I suggest you look there:

According to him, he used 3Dmax to create the models!

Might anyone know how to extract them?

That is not very useful and I already extracted them. They are certainly not 3DS format now, nor is the textures. I'm sure they have been converted to a proprietary format otherwise it would be more straight forward.

Anyways, I would have been able to notice if it was 3DS, even if a really early format, since it would have it stamped on. The best thing I can think of that would be useful would be how the game processes the models and textures but that would take somebody to use a debugger, or source code of the game itself. I doubt the source code thing.

So, this leaves that the models still need to be figured out to be converted as well as the textures.

Not meaning to be a downer, just there's a process and knowing what they were made with isn't the same as knowing the format they were made into. I do want to convert them as well but the information given isn't very... useful, at least I don't think so.

No worries, I understand your point.

Unfortunately, I don't think Mr craft here has any information on the nature of the proprietary format, nor on the way to convert those models...

You can discuss technicalities with him should you wish (as a modeler, perhaps he'll give you access to more than I can, his email is on his website), but there's always the blank from the moment THQ took the reigns of the project.

Did my best! sorry!

Back to topic: many thanks for the SC meshes already! Perhaps those shape files could be useful when recreating the models...

Thing is, if they were figured out, would be an easy process to convert them to a regular format. Personally I'd think they would be easier as they contain no animations and are only vertex meshes as I understand. I think similar to Descent models for ships, since they have no moving parts. The thrusters are a different model/effect.
