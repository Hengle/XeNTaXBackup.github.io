I'm at a loss hahaha.

Google searches on EDB turn up empty except for Windows database BS. I've tried out a few tools to extract .GEOM files and nothing worked.

I'm trying to extract Davy Jones' 3D mesh and textures. I don't care if I don't get the bones and rig.

I've been able to extract the ebd from the iso and FileList.001. It's a Eurocom-developed game.

Here is the file I'd like extracted.

Thank you!

I hate doing this, usually but...

Bump?
