- Post Title: .sngw files

I was looking online how to open sngw files, most pages say to just rename the files to .ogg, but when i do that, i can't open it with anything.

Has anyone found a way to properly open or convert the files to .ogg so they can be correctly opened? Thanks.   

I will post a file as an example.

They're not standard Ogg files - they're encrypted.

But you can open them as they are with Foobar/vgmstream.  You can then convert them from there if you wish.
