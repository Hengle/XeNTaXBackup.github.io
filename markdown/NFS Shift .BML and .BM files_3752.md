- Post Title: NFS Shift .BML and .BM* files

Hello,

NFS Shift has lots of .BML and other .BMx, they looks like a binary version (compiled) of plain XML files. I have attached 2 of them inside the RAR archive.

Can you, reverse engineering experts, take a look at them and give us the file structure so we can modify those files?

Changes made to the XML files doesn't change anything in game...

Thanks!

[http://openebxml.sourceforge.net/realiz ... E_040.html](http://openebxml.sourceforge.net/realization/components/bml/documents/README_040.html)

unfortunately that library is written in that stupid java and seems unusable (the example provided there is completely useless)

I too would like to request this, if someone is able to decipher it.
