Hi guys, Is it possible to extract textures from this game?

I was checking the files of Aline and Carnby, I am pretty sure these are their textures but I don't know about the format. Aline has just one texture, Carnby has two textures. The size of each image is 256x256, you can see this in the header, that is the only thing I know.
