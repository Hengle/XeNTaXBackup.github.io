Hi there, here's how I got a texture from Marc Ecko's Getting Up using [Console Texture Explorer](http://expertarts.com/console-texture-explorer-pspps2/?lang=en), here's a screenshot for the values I found:



Textures can be found in engine/textures/tag_art once [this .bms script](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=5119) is run with [QuickBMS](http://aluigi.altervista.org/papers.htm#quickbms).
Enjoy modding this cool game!
