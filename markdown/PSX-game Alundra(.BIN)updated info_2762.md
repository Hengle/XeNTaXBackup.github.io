I am not sure I can help you, I stumble on graphics as well but do try to be patient, some things here just take time. I'm sure somebody will help you, like Deniz or Strobe when he gets back. Somebody may even already be looking at it.

Deniz is still around, he's the most likely to help. He helped me immensely with Albion not long ago by making a quick efficient converter for it. Right now, he's working on trying to figure out a model that he himself requested but he may help here too. There are others as well. Some things just take time is all .

I'm still here, though my free time is running out. 

Well, I've taken a short look at the files, but cannot make much out of them. Some contain offset tables, while others do not. There seem to be some sub-headers ("EZ" oder "EZ.tx"?) Beside that, the rest still looks pretty much unstructured to me. I can't even guess what type of data might hide in there.

Wow...that's bad.
Is there a way else to find it out?

(I wonder how the hell the PSX could read those files then =P)

Well, the fact that they look unstructured to me does not imply that they are unstructured. 

That just means that analyzing the format takes more time and effort -- and I'll probably not be able to invest those during the upcoming months.

Would be best if somebody else took over at this point ...

If someone still needs, I can upload packer/unpacker for "DATAS.BIN" and text extractor/reinserter (but tools in russian lang).
Better late than never)

Hi people!,

Does anyone have that aforementioned 
> packer/unpacker for "DATAS.BIN" and text extractor/reinserter
? 
Maybe it's on GitHub somewhere?

Thank you.
