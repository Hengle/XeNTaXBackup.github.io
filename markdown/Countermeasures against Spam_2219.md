This used to be a spammer writing this here post, but I've taken over control of this unwanted guest and rewrote this post to cover the issue of spam at the forum. I've taken several countermeasures against these dumbasses. I will continue to fight them. Things should have been improved now. - Mr.Mouse

Okay, that does it. I'm going to install a hack again to make it hard for bots to register (because they usually also enter a website upon registering, and these are no longer allowed, so if they provide a website-variable anyway, the hack notices them as bots and will not register AND will ban the IP it came from)

lol
I see youve noticed the growing amount of BOTS aswell then.
One thing though, sometimes people can have the same IP dress even if there at different locations.
I wonder if that will ever cause anyone any troubles.

Done. Captain did not want to install it, thought it was a dirty hack, but I think it was a nice and clear mod. Now let's see if we get rid of those bots.
