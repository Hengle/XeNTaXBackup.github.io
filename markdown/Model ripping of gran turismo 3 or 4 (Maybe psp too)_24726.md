- Post Title: Model ripping of gran turismo 3 or 4? (Maybe psp too)

Been thinking about this, and saw posts related to these gran turismo ripping where they got cars and track models...tho, most links i see are either broken or just they give me no pictures of what the rippers did


My point is i wanna see how i could get somewhere to begin there, also cuz i have my eyes centered into ripping swiss alps
