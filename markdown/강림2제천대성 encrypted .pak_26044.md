- Post Title: 강림2:제천대성 encrypted .pak

Hello! I was playing this game time ago and many creatures in there where cool for rip, sadly the .pak  is encrypted, was trying to found some info or the key using ollydbg but honestly was not able to do it. I know are many skilled people about encrypted assets here, hope someone can have a look at the samples, anyways thanks for read and have a great week!

- Post Title: 강림2:제천대성 encrypted .pak

Hello! as I have had the old .pak from about 6 months or more, I had not got any kind of clue from the .pak file, but now a friend told me that you can have a clue that the textures are PKM format and the meshes they are ogre mesh ( MeshSerializer - Serializer), so there can be a hope that they are not encrypted anymore, I will leave the main.pak in case someone can take a look at it! Thank you for reading!
