- Post Title: Danganronpa V3, MS Gamepass, extracting ARC files?

It seems like all the information out there for digging into this game's archives is for the PSP version which used some sort of CryTek archives.

However, the version from the MS store has ARC files that the crytek extractors won't touch.

I've made some progress in starting to understand the format but the name obfuscation system looks like a headache.  Not impossible, but I'm hoping it's a solved problem already and I can save my time on it.

Has anybody else tried digging into this version of the game?
