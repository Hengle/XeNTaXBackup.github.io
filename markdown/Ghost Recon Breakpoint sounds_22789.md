- Post Title: Ghost Recon Breakpoint sounds

By using Ravioli Tool I extracted bnk and .wem files from the soundspc_sfx_wea_.pck but i can't find text files with the names weapons etc. Inside of the sound data folder there's file localization_hc.bin but idk how to open it.

Edit: I threw the BNK file into Ravioli Scanner and found the .dat files Unkn0001.dat etc

Hi! Did you manage to read those .dat files? If yes are there weapon names? If not, have you find a way to identify the sounds?
