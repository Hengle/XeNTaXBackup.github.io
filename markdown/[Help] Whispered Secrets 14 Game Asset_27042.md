- Post Title: [Help] Whispered Secrets 14 Game Asset

this game had an asset as pak file (It seems like a normal password zip file,but inside it had full of bunch unknown character with no file extension at all.).I want to extract its sound/music files inside the asset,but I couldn't find the correct algorithm from quickbms to extract its content (and correct all the files in readable file extension) Thanks a lot......
The password I known is this:

```
30fa9cde-f6fe-59c9-a284-0ecb7df8e8c3
```

Well, IT IS a normal password zip file.   

It can be opened without any issues with Winrar and those "character with no file extension" seems to be filenames that were obfuscated by developers before releasing archive to public.

You can't really do anything about it, unless you reverse engineer obfuscation method.
You may try to manaully rename, for example if you change name from "26b55af5-4c11-5710-a0c2-84475e7e2e39" to "file1.ogv",
you'll get working OGV Theora Video (more info [here](http://wiki.xentax.com/index.php/OGG_Container)) which can be played in Media Player Classic.
