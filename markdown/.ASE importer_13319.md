- Post Title: .ASE importer

For 3ds Max I can't find an importer for .ase yet there is an exporter built in. By any chance does someone have an importer / could make one? Having it would go a long way for towards my research of a format nobody can figure out.

I don't know what version of 3dsMax you use but there is a couple here for version 7, 2011 and 2012

There is ase import for Blender as well, you could use it as a conversion tool if nothing else.

found an online model converter that supports ase input

My Max version is 2015 but that's helpful as hopefully I can just update the code then it will work. 
Offhand do you know if the Blender version supports Helpers such as a "Dummy" as that is the main reason why I am looking for an .ase importer.

I couldn't tell you, i've never used ase import for Blender but i think the Blender equivalent of "Dummy" would be an "Empty".
