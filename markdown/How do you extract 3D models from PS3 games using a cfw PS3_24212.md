- Post Title: How do you extract 3D models from PS3 games using a cfw PS3?

Just like my title asks, how do you extract 3D models (characters, weapons, items, etc.) from ps3 games using a cfw ps3? I'm brand new to this, and I'd appreciate any tips and/or tutorials you have to offer. 

It feels worth mentioning that my end goal is to 3d print the models for personal use, so any info about that process would also be helpful.
