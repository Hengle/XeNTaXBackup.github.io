I just got my hands on this game : [Hatred](http://store.steampowered.com/app/341940/)

And found the tool to extract the pak file [Hatred-Unpacker](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=32&t=12892&p=106601#p106601)

Has anyone taken a look at the content, like models, animations, textures, if so ... I'm all ears
