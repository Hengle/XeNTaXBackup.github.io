PiStory [http://pistory.aeriagames.com/download](http://pistory.aeriagames.com/download)
Very cute 2D game, their data look like use raw bitmap, I have attached some sample here.
Please help me convert it to standard format like pure BMP or TGA

Normal bitmap encrypted with a very (I mean VERY) simple Xor routine.

Step through the entire file and Xor each byte by 0x84 to restore it.
