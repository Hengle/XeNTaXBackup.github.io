- Post Title: D2R

Hi guys! You've probably heard that there was testing by Blizz - D2R Alpha Test. I would like to get help here for information on 3D format. *.model
I've tried Griffon Studio 3D Model 3.5. But, he did not open.
Thanks!
p/s
There is a mention of granny in the lines of the executable. as well as PopcornFX. Maybe this will help somehow.
