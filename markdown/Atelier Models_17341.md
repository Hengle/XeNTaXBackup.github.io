So I'm studying 3d models and scripts that involve packing and unpacking models in games, because I'm curious and studying it for potential future game development, but I feel like I'm running into a brick wall. I'm 100% a noob and I couldn't find a real "how to start learning all this stuff" guide so I sorta dived in head first and abusing google, anywho..

So right now I have 3 Atelier games I'm trying to take the models out of and convert them into obj so I can study them in maya
Atelier Ayesha (Ps3)
Atelier Sophie (PC)
Atelier Firis (PC)

And I'm considering messing with the other atelier games too, 

I've done games like Hyperdimension neptunia, Grandchase, and Project diva, using quick BMS, Noesis, Blender, and Maya.

But everything I do with the Atelier files make no sense, So I've collcted a few BMS scripts, and unpackers for Atelier, I'm working on Sophie right now. And I unpacked the PAK file, got all the gz files and g1t files. I see people mentioning .g1m files but I haven't seen any of those, I would unpack the gz files and get .elixir files but I have no idea what to do with those, I've heard people converting the .elixir into .g1m but I'm not sure what to do. 

I'm starting to wonder if I should have started with earlier games rather than the newer PC/ps3 ones.

Which games would be easier for me to tackle, the ps3 ones, Vita ones, or these PC ones, cause I'm not sure.

*lays face first on the floor*

I just want the models, none of the other files... *rolls around on said floor*

I wanna study them cause they're so pretty ; v ;

So I tried more bms files, still don't know what I'm doing, but I got textures, which is cool, though they are kinda useless without models lol

So I started messing with Neptunia U files since I'm waiting for help on the atelier models. I got a script to unpack the .cat files, the gtx files; which gave the dds files. But uh, I assume the tmd files have something to do with the models, but the only thing I've seen is something that uses 3ds max, which I don't use, I use Maya, or metasequoia. Any ideas what I should do to find the models for Neptunia U? 

*Is trying to learn about this stuff lol
