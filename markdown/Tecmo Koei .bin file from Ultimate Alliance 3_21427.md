- Post Title: Tecmo Koei .bin file from Ultimate Alliance 3

I've searched the forums for every possible BMS script I can find for games made by TK, but none of them work with these particular .bin files. 
I've also tried manually extracting without any success.

If anyone could provide direction, I've attached a couple of these files. Thank you

What exactly are you trying to get?

From what I can see, files aren't compressed, looks more like a table for the DataCharacter and DataGallery.
