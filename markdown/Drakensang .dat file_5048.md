- Post Title: Drakensang .dat file

Hi there, I am the author of the [Drakensang Savegame Editor](http://www.jardas.de/drakensang2/) and have received various bug reports claiming that the editor won't work with the Polish version of the game.

The file format has something to do with StarForce (first 4 header bytes: SFFS). Unfortunately the contents [appear to be encrypted](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=21&t=2084).

We would need the decryption key for the file which should be quite hard to obtain. This is very unfortunate for our Polish friends out there...
