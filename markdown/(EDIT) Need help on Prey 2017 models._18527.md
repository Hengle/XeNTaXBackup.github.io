- Post Title: (EDIT) Need help on Prey 2017 models.

[viewtopic.php?f=16&t=17217](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=17217) I saw this, but 3DS Max will not run on my weak laptop, nor do I know how to use it anyway. Anyone that knows how to use CryEngine models and 3DS Max, would anyone be kind enough to extract some Operator models for me? Medical, Science, and Engineering Operators, plus January. I already used Prey Convert and CGF Converter (CGF Converter doesn't work good for Prey models though) to see models in Blender, but there is no way to add the textures, and it has no bones. I do not know how to rig or texture, and I prefer to have originals anyway. I have folders with the Operator content, but it's too big to send here.
