- Post Title: .PSP Format?

So i have searched and searched the forums for this and google as well and i have yet to find anything that is related with the .psp format there a few games i have come cross that uses this format but it doesn't seem like anyone has looked into at least to public knowledge that i have seen.

Well one game i have looked at is Star Wars Battlefront Elite Squadron and i know the .pmf and .at3 can be extracted as those contain videos and audio files and jpcsp can pretty much extract them by just playing the game but the .psp format that contains the models and textures and those are in a .asr format which is the Asura engine and has a quickbms script to extract the content from but like i said there is no program or script to extract the .psp

So could someone tell me if there is a program that extracts the .psp files and if not can someone look at them cause they can be opened in winrar if you right click and view files and can pretty much see everything in said file so (i'm not anywhere good at this) but think it wouldn't be to hard to extract from if a script or something was made.

Here is 2 files if anyone wants to look at them.

You can view file list and extract from those .psp samples with the Asura Engine Extractor.

If you want a more complete and accurate extraction you should use aluigi's bms script here

to get a clean mesh i had to set the vertices start address to 2a and save the mesh
but to get clean UVs i had to set the vertices start address to 1a and save that mesh too
then i deleted the vt data in the obj with bad UVs and copied the vt data from the obj with cleans UVs to it

edit again 
i see what the problem is now   
the vertex stride begins with 4 bytes UVs then probably 6 bytes for normals then 6 bytes for XYZ vert positions
and this was why my offsets were originally chaotic and this is impossible to rearrange in Hex2obj

I tried the dark trooper model

There was 15 submeshes that had to be moved into place and no head in the model file, the UVs aren't perfect either but i tried every byte from 6-16 and 6 looked the best. The first 4 bytes of the model files vary, but 0x4 looks consistent with the number of submeshes in a model file.

The header of the single mesh files looks like this to me
int magic
int numMeshes
int numVerts
int numFaceindices
int ? zero padding
int ? always 2 less than numFaceindices
int ? zero padding
int ? zero padding

for the models with more than one submesh there is a table after that
int zero padding
int ? relative offset
int numVerts
int numFaceindices 


The tga/bmp textures are swizzled/twiddled and you can fix them with Console Texture Explorer and convert them to tm2 files which Noesis can open and convert to something else.

Star Wars: Battlefront - Elite Squadron texture header
2 bytes - width
2 bytes - height
2 bytes - unk
1 byte - bpp id (4 = 4bpp, 5 = 8bpp)
1 byte - num mipmaps
