- Post Title: Support for Ninja Gaiden 2 .LIVE DLC file?

I am wondering if it is possible to add support to the Ninja Gaiden 2 .LIVE DLC file?

It contains models and textures.

Not really expert in hex editor but I found some file formats inside



Here is a small sample of the .LIVE file generated from the cutter. The original file is 11.2MB big so I have to cut it down to the allowable size of 215KB...
[NG2 - Fiend Costume File.zip](https://xentaxbackup.github.io/file/1602_NG2 - Fiend Costume File.zip)

No, these files are RSA signed by Microsoft.
