- Post Title: Radical Entertainment "P3D" file

Hi all. I wanted to know how I can rip these p3d models from the GameCube game "Monsters, Inc. Scream Arena". I tried Lucas' P3D Editor already and it said that "Big endian P3D files are not currently supported". Are there any tools which can handle these? I need some of these characters converted (T-posed - I tried Ninja Ripper. It rips them posed, sadly).
