- Post Title: Reverse Engineer .AVR format file

Hey guys I was wondering if anyone has any experience decoding .AVR video files? I have an .AVR to which is a proprietary format specific to Everfocus DVRs. I would like to reverse engineer the file to find any potential metadata it may contain. I did find a program EF-Reader that will display the start and stop times per each recording but there appears to be video missing from the archive. I'm trying to see if when the video was archived if the .AVR container would show if the video was edited.

I'm pretty sure it's mostly a MPEG-2 transport stream file format.
Given it may be a special format? I'd have to see a copy.
Wouldn't be the first file format I've reversed.

May we have a sample please?
