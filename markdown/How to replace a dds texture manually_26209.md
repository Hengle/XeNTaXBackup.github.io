- Post Title: How to replace a dds texture manually?

I've made progress in being able to extract textures from the game I'm trying to modify. They are DXT1 DDS textures. But how could I modify these textures and put the modified textures in place of the original ones?

GIMP has native support for DDS files. Use it to edit your textures.
