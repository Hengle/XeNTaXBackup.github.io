- Post Title: Animation from Switch model format isn't working

I have a dump of NSW Link's Awakening models and I'm trying to get the animation working. They look great in Switch-Toolbox and the .DAE format looks great in Blender. The problem is that when I try to import a .SMD into Blender everything gets messed up. The model will also animate as if there was nothing wrong with it.
