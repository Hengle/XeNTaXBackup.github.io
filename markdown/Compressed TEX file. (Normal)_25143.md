- Post Title: Compressed TEX file. (Normal)

Hello,

This is TEX file is from the latest WWE '22 video game. This is the normal file, but it would seem they have condensed textures into one.

 R = Normal X , G = Normal Y , B = Metallic , A = Roughness.

We have the diffuse opening, but this one does not seem to work. Does anyone have any clues?

Thank you.
