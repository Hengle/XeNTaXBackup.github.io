- Post Title: Modding results. Why we are here.

I want to invite any member here to share the results of the efforts of their modding, quite possibly assisted by members here. People come here a lot, and they figure out file formats, or have someone else do that for them. But then what happens? What is done with the knowledge gained? It is very interesting to see what came out of it. So why not share, even if it is simply replacing some texture, or sound or whatever?

Just show what you did! It may inspire others, and you would be immortal! 

Just like Bruce Lee!

- Post Title: Modding results. Why we are here.

I don't have any Xentax-exclusive results--all my mods are the result of research from several different places. But I've used a lot of the research here in extracting assets and research. I have a few game mods that are successful in at least part due to the research done here. The initial IGB and ZSM/ZSS research for X-Men Legends and Marvel Ultimate Alliance led to the mods below, and I'm currently working on a mod for Cars: The Video Game thanks to BMS scripts made here.

Below is my Marvel Ultimate Alliance Xbox mod. All of the tools for the game are community made, and anything edited by hand was because of what I learned here (this is a direct copy/paste from our forums at marvelmods.com)

Star Wars Battlefront II Xbox Mod
Status: [v1.5.8 released](http://www.gametoast.com/forums/viewforum.php?f=75)
Adds 20+ new maps to the game, including all the original Battlefront maps. New game types such as Order 66 are included (Clones vs Jedi), along with more modes on each maps (I.E. Hero Deathmatch is on more than Mos Eisley now). It also has several new heroes, including Cad Bane, Kyle Katarn, Commander Cody and more. An in-game cheat menu is also included since there is no more online play over Xbox LIVE. You can see some YouTube previews of gameplay [here](http://www.gametoast.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=75&t=22156).

=============================================================================

X-Men Legends II Xbox Mod
Status: Unreleased, *mostly* finished (see [here](http://marvelmods.com/forum/index.php/topic,1609.0.html) for info)
Adds two new playable characters (Mystique and Psylocke) along with several skins and some bug fixes. Never finished this one, but it does have a lot of content.

=============================================================================

Cars: All-Star Showdown
Status: In early progress
A mod for Cars: The Video Game which adds more racing venues, cars from Cars: Mater-National Championship, and several new skins. I always had a strange affinity for this game, so when I found that it was easy to mod I couldn't pass it up. Had a lot of success with Cars Mater-National on the PC (new playable cars, skins, races), but am currently struggling with Rainbow Studios .RES containers (see [here](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?p=73257#p73257)). I have to be able to recompile on consoles, which is retarded since many files exist both in the .RES containers and elsewhere. If anyone's interested in modding the first three Cars games I have documentation I've put together, and if anyone can help with rebuilding .RES files in any form (even if my source files need to be split) I'd really appreciate it.

Here are a few images from Cars Mater-National:
