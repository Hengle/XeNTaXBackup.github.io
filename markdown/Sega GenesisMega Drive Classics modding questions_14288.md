- Post Title: Sega Genesis/Mega Drive Classics modding questions

The Sega Genesis/Mega Drive Classic games now have support for modding through Steam Workshop. As a result, I'm wanting to get a better understanding on this. What modding Tools exists for each game? Can these tools be used on the Steam versions? If anyone has any info on these questions, please let me know what you do. Thank you for your time.

Edit: I think I found the answer to one of my questions. It seems Sega's offering uncompressed files of the games. I managed to locate some Streets of Rage 2 and 3 hacking tools online and tested them. You may have to change the file extension to bin, but the uncompressed files did work with them.
