- Post Title: Shin Megami Tensei IMAGINE - Music Files

I've been trying to play the SMT Imagine audio files, however with no luck.

The files appear as .wav but when looking at the header they seem to be compressed in some form.

Here I link all the music files in the game, hopefully someone would be able to help me out with converting them into listenable format.

For all the tracks, you can get them here:

I will be very grateful if someone can figure out how to play them.

I'll take a look.

But could you just post one of the music files please?

Well it won't let me upload as attachment due to too big filesize, but here's a mediafire link to just one track.

Would be great if you could help me out. I know for a fact that some other person already managed to do it, but said person doesn't wish to share info or the tools.

Sorry Panzah, I wasn't able to make any head way. Maybe someone else with more experience regarding compression would be able to help

That's too bad. I know there must be a way since one person from the forum here: [http://forums.atlusonline.com/forums/in ... 19522&st=0](http://forums.atlusonline.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=19522&st=0) already managed to do it, but refuses to share info...

Maybe someone else will be able to help, it would certainly be great since there's a lot of amazing unreleased music in this game.

hi.

the files are only xored...
the problem is that all files have a different xored key but which is easy to find.

you'll find on attachments a little prog i made on c# to convert all the bgm files.
just execute it into the bgm folder.
it will create a "xored" folder with all the converted file which are playable on winamp (plain Wav files).
Sorry, didn't find loop points on those file (maybe the loop points are in another file)

cheers.

Thanks man, much appreciated.
I also found a japanese tool which can also convert the files, maybe you could take a look at it since it includes source code, and see if there's a way to get loop points?
