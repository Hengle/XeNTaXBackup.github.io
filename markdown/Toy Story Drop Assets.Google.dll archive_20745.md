Too bad this isn't a Unity game which would've made it less of a pain to deal with. That being said, while I can extract the archive itself using ILSpy, getting the individual assets off it is another question.

I actually tried ripping it myself, but using the Windows 10 version of it. Apparently, this version uses a Game Maker type format, but none of the tools I tried to make it work with seem to do the job.


If anyone wants to try looking at it, feel free to: [https://mega.nz/#!hAABECbZ!BKpl44AMscC6 ... d5DYuLlB0A](https://mega.nz/#!hAABECbZ!BKpl44AMscC6PYKbIFOFuHpNrcyiye5gyd5DYuLlB0A)

Using offzip reveals this for example:
