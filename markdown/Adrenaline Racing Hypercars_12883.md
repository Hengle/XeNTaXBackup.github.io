Maybe it sounds stupid but how to extract archive? WinRar  and 7zip returns me error message. That's why I uploaded them.

(Most of them will just think you uploaded a corrupt archive. So did I.)
Anyway, use offzip. There are some explanations in the forum on how to use it.

btw: would make sense to delete your thread copy before someone is posting there
