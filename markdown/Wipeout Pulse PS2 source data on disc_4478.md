- Post Title: Wipeout Pulse PS2 source data on disc

So I was poking around with the Wipeout series the other and found a file full of goodies on the Pulse disc. There is a file called PADZ2. This file is a ZIP file and its full of development data! Music, sounds, ships, tracks, textures, theres tons of win in there. Music is 48khz 16-bit signed stereo wave, ships and tracks are Maya Binaries, textures are TGA with a few PSD's thrown in.
