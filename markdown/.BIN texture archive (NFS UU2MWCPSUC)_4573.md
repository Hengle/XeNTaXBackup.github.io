- Post Title: .BIN texture archive (NFS U/U2/MW/C/PS/UC)

Hi all, I'm new here, but I'm modding NFS series for some time. I'd like to show you some information abou textures in NFS Underground-Undercover.

BIN archives in NFS can be opened with some programs:
MWTex
BinTex [http://www.nfscars.net/file/view/underground/5184.aspx](http://www.nfscars.net/file/view/underground/5184.aspx)
TexEd [http://www.nfscars.net/file/view/undercover/9139.aspx](http://www.nfscars.net/file/view/undercover/9139.aspx)
Total Commander with BIN/BUN plugin

Sorry for not great English and this information is known by most of people, but I think it can be useful.
Also welcome to nfscars.net to other NFS mods.
