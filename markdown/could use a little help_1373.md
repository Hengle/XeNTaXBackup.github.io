- Post Title: could use a little help

just got the program and am trying to figure out how to use it.  i see all the grafs in the wiki, but how do we use them?  to be specific, looking at using the umd16 one on some tom clancy games.  do i just copy into a text file and rename it?  just wondering how to apply them.  thanks.

Using MexBinderPlus (see website). But the version there is obsolete. We are working on a new release of MultiEx Commander, that will include a new version of the MexBinder. It will give you MexScriptor that can read the scripts you talk about and save as bms.
