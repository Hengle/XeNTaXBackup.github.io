- Post Title: Help with Unity face morphs

So I exported a Model from KOF All Star using AssetStudio, and when I import it to Noesis, it plays the facial morphs all together (no matter what skeletal animation has been playing) and not the actual fram data of the morphs from the animationclip and animator. Any ideas on how to export the face morphs w/ animations to match how they are used ingame?

really the facials made it with vertex really the facials, Noesis also showed me facials in disorder but it's just a random preview of them.
(Blender) i don't know if reproduce the vertex movement but If it is to experience it in other games or upload the model either for use of animations, resources or MMD videos you would need to ask on a different theme

Tip: In blender some models have a animated pose, you can clear it in top of the timeline Pose>Clear transform>All. And the model stay in T-pose

In the case of MMD, you can download a script of minmode to export the model with the vertex from noesis and export it with the plugin
Note: The plugin don't export the name of the morphs
