He means that is the format of the file. Perhaps something that handles Unreal Engine 3 files will work on it. Try it out.

Do not try to "research" ue3  First of all its changing probably on every game,sometimes packages are hardcoded and you never know if your "extractor" will work on another games using ue3 

I wanted to do a extractor for upk files used by ue3,but this format is pretty undocumented
