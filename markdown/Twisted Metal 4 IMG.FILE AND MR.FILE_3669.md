we where just being sarcasting, doesn't work on everyone, just like some pills.

What we mean is that you didn't really tell us anything. You write that it can't be uploaded? Where are you trying tu upload? Have you tried archiving it with winrar? What is it that you want with the files, just share them or is it anything special you want xentax to look at? 3d models, texture or what?
