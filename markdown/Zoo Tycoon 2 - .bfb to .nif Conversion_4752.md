- Post Title: Zoo Tycoon 2 - .bfb to .nif Conversion

Lately I've been getting into Designing for Zoo Tycoon 2.  I've found out how to Convert some Models from other Games into the Required .nif format for that Game, and I've been having a lot of Fun.

Some of the Models in ZT2, however, are not .nif files, but .bfb files.  I haven't had any success finding a Program that can Open these .bfb files, let alone Convert them into .nif files.  If I could figure this out, then a lot more Options in Designing would be Available to me (and the other ZT2 Designers out there).

Does anyone know what Program I would need to do this, or some Plugin I could Download to make it work?  Currently, I've got NifSkope, Blender, and GMax.  Sadly, I don't have Access to the other, more Expensive Programs.

Thanks to anyone that can help out!
