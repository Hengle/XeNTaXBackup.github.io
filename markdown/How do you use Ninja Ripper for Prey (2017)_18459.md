- Post Title: How do you use Ninja Ripper for Prey (2017)?

I've seen people use NR on Prey before so I know it's possible. I've tired directly ripping from the game files but can't get that to work. Now I'm trying Ninja Ripper but can't get that to work either. Intruder inject just launches the game but the game doesn't actually launch, just an instance of it. I also can't get the DirectX wrappers to work either. I've seen people use Ninja Ripper on Prey, but I can't figure it out. Please help!
