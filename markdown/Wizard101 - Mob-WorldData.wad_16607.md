- Post Title: Wizard101 - Mob-WorldData.wad

I'm having trouble extracting data from this wad. This is the error message when I try using the script I got from [this thread.](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=4434) I also tried the script I got from [this thread[/UR], but it froze without any error message.



And here is the [url=https://nofile.io/f/X4iFzvDP4Q1/Mob-WorldData.wad]file](https://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=12152). It's a big one though, and it's possible that the size is the problem here.
