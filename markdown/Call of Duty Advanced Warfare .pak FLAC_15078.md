Hello. Author the tool "[AWFlac](http://dev.cra0kalo.com/?p=195)" does not provide support for old tools.
Can anyone help with extracting audio from the game? Program extracts audio from no all the archives and somewhere not completely (soundfile1.pak = 1.05 GB, but audio = 509 MB).

Hi, but how did you get criteria numbers? 
What is in other soundfile*.pak files?
Which criteria numbers go to other files?

Which criteria numbers go to other files?The criteria number is just hexadecimal code.

```
66 4C 61 43 00 00 00 22
```
 is just

```
fLaC..."
```
 in ASCII


Games generally don't use multiple compression formats, they usually stick to just one.

But it always helps to post a sample archive

If anyone knows which of the 90-some soundfile.pak archives contain music, please do let us all know. Dumping these one by one is just a pain in the ass right now.
