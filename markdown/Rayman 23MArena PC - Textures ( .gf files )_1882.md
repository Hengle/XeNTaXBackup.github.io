- Post Title: Rayman 2/3/M/Arena PC - Textures ( *.gf files )

Hello,

I need some help converting the *.gf files from Rayman 2/3/M/Arena PC to VIEWABLE images/textures. That's why I posted this topic.

To download a few samples from .gf files:
[download.php?id=442](http://forum.xentax.com/download.php?id=442)

I hope someone will manage to convert them.
