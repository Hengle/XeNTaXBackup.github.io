First, find a version of TTG Tools that supports your font file. Then run "TTG Tools.exe", go to "Font Editor" and load your font file. Then list of coordinates should be loaded. You can edit coordinates or import/export DDS texture by clicking right mouse button on font editor. You can edit DDS file in GIMP with DDS plugin installed. And that's it.

But do you know any version of TTG Tool that supports Batman the Enemy Within ? Because I was searching and didnt found. Is there any other way I can edit this ? For example in hex or sth like this or any other method ?
