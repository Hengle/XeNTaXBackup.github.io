- Post Title: MediEvil/MediEvil2 on PSX?

Hi, I am desperate to get my hands on characters, levels etc to do some lovely HQ renders with. 

I've already tried the whole ripping through an emulator using OGLE and Dxripper but I can only get junk obj's at less that 2kb each and textures, so has anyone managed to get models from MediEvil or knows of some generic PSX tool I'm missing.

Oh and the files seem to be split into archives with the filetype ".LVB" For example "CS_LVL1.LVB" I can upload one of the LVB's if you like too.

Thanks.
