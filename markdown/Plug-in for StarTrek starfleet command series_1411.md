I don't think this is an archive really. More like a bunch of script events for the setup.

Yeah we would probably be best to look at the large 60MB archive you mentioned - click on [viewtopic.php?t=1270](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?t=1270) for information on sending us the file, or use the cutter at [http://www.watto.org/extract/download/cutter.zip](http://www.watto.org/extract/download/cutter.zip) to make a small copy of the archive to attach here or email.
