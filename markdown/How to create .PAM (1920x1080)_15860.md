- Post Title: How to create .PAM (1920x1080)

Hi everybody .... I am new to the forge and I like that someone can help me ...

I am a fan of ps3 games and I am working on editing video on this console.

I am looking for a tutorial to help me created video in forma .PAM ... I parde of 1920X1080 large format video and not ICON1.pam

I have to try with the software (PS3 PAMF Tools) but unfortunately this software can convert only small video of 320X176

The goal of my work is to decrease the size of games ps3 with the rip of video by changing the big video by video that weighs less and takes less space on the hard drive

Thank you for your rethink

Now, I don't know if its ok to post the link for the tutorial your looking at (due to leaked Sony PS3 SDK files), because I think its only one that mentions that size for icon in the menu, but...That's where your wrong, the software works fine, you only have to skip the step in the tutorial about "Resize" making the video small like that, and then you'll be good to go.

just leave at 0 both columns where is 320 and 176.
