Purples are normals, grays are specular as you can guess. For diffuse GoW is using some kind of texture blending. I am also trying to get it right in my GoW tool, before releasing a map support.

Like in your screenshot you would need to blend 8 and 9. The closest result I got it using blend mode "lighten", but don't know how the shaders does it ingame.
