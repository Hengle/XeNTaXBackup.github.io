Awesome work dude.
I wonder if the exploit for this firmware will become public anytime soon.

Tool released. 
Current version only supports skeletal models. Statics/Map support is planned, but no est.

This is so awesome! I really thought it would take a few years before we'd get KH3 models. Ty for all this   . No idea how to do any of this porting stuff, but about to learn heh heh.

Amazing work. I wasn't expecting this to be achieved so soon. I really want to extract the models from Tangled. Would anyone be able to share the game files with me?

This is awesome! I wish someone would share the game files with me to try this out! I've seen some models ripped with this tool so thank you!
Would be awesome if I had the game files! If anyone can hit me up lemme know!

Great!! Since most people don't extract enemies and bosses is there anywhere we can get a hold of the game files to help with the extracting effort?

Tool updated: map support.

Usage is similar to IJ2 maps.
First process all "meshes" folders of a map, it will create a lot of staticmesh.RAW files.
Then use .UMAP with the tool

notes:
- not all map data will be supported. There are many ways in UE3/UE4 to add static mesh, i only support most obsious now. Also no skeletal (moving) meshes and no foliage.
- some meshes have too many UV pairs, this increases size. Some of them are not ever real UVs, just some data stored in UV buffer part, no idea what is that.

Yeah, I must admit when I first saw that it did seem unneeded. Still does. Hopefully needless drama won't get in the way of a shared interest.

It really sucks when people ruin something for others for their own selfish reasons. I'm so sorry that you've had to deal with an ungrateful brat, sadly those do exist :/

Jesus christ this is big. Pretty sure 6.20 ps4s can dump the disc, unless this is a new exploit. Im surprised these guys even went public with this. If theres a working and legit ps4 .pkg in the wild of KH3 im pretty sure Square Enix would collectively lose their shit. Wish I had access to it so I could at least do some digging around in the files. I've got a feeling that theres probably quite a bit of leftover data in the game.

Hope we can get a Vanitas rip soon though. That would be an absolute treat to port. But don't harass the guy for the game data. Its not going to happen as much as I wish it were so.

I do Apologize  Starfire, I admit it was a stupid thing to say. I dont want to cause drama, i just got annoyed since I just remembered how you have completely ignored me in the past and how Roxas wanted you removed from his group back then. my opinion on you shouldnt be based on past events and i want to say that im sorry for being a Dick

Hacked together a maskless Vanitas . Had to borrow Anti Aquas eye color though. Can anyone get me the proper alpha and diffuse maps for his hair? Right now it's just a normal map on top of a dark blue color.

most of the organization is in the enemy folder. Here is what i've found so far.

most of the organization is in the enemy folder. Here is what i've found so far.

Everything you need to know about how to create the eyes and hair proper is in the material properties .txt files that extract when you dump the textures. This includes other things in addition to the eyes and hair, like clothing. They need deciphering, but here's an example of something easier I've been working with so far:

```
        ParameterName = Hairline2Normal_Range
        ParameterValue = 2.5
        ParameterInfo = { Name=None }
    }
```


This is in Sora's folder, p_ex001_hair_Inst.props.txt. This section tells you his hair texture is using "Hairline2". Further down, you can see this part, which tells you the mask he uses to simulate split ends on the tips of his spikes, and even the normal map texture used:

```
    TextureParameterValues[0] =
    {
        ParameterName = AOTexture
        ParameterValue = Texture2D'Character/pc/p_ex001/mdl/mat0/p_ex001_0o00.p_ex001_0o00'
        ParameterInfo = { Name=None }
    }
    TextureParameterValues[1] =
    {
        ParameterName = HairLineMaskTex
        ParameterValue = Texture2D'Character/Shader/Material_set/SQEX_HairMaterialTex/hairlineendmask2.hairlineendmask2'
        ParameterInfo = { Name=None }
    }
    TextureParameterValues[2] =
    {
        ParameterName = Normalmap
        ParameterValue = Texture2D'Character/pc/p_ex001/mdl/mat0/p_ex001_H_0n00.p_ex001_H_0n00'
        ParameterInfo = { Name=None }
    }
}
```


This is, again, one of the simpler cases of this. You can find not only the exact textures used though, but there are other things like specularity amounts (in UE4 units, so you need to guesstimate from my experience if you're using Maya, Max, or Blender). Another cool thing to note is, the hair and hair tips meshes use the exact same rig, so just copy and paste the material setup and his hair will look ideal, just like this:


One more thing: Do not(!!!) just copy 0.2 textures and delete/hide the eye lens mesh. 0.2 and KH3 handle the eye textures TOTALLY DIFFERENTLY FROM EACH OTHER. 0.2 uses the lense to add specularity(?) and other effects on top of the eye whilst painting the actual eyeball with its textures. In KH3, the eyeball has its own texture and the lens functions as an iris with its own textures IN ADDITION to other effects.

Tool updated: map support.

Usage is similar to IJ2 maps.
First process all "meshes" folders of a map, it will create a lot of staticmesh.RAW files.
Then use .UMAP with the tool

notes:
- not all map data will be supported. There are many ways in UE3/UE4 to add static mesh, i only support most obsious now. Also no skeletal (moving) meshes and no foliage.
- some meshes have too many UV pairs, this increases size. Some of them are not ever real UVs, just some data stored in UV buffer part, no idea what is that.

They get exported as ascii format correct?

I used XPS to import the files I got from UMAP but I only get like one mesh :L
I'm pretty sure I am doing this wrong

Download this and extract the batch files to the mesh folder of a map. Copy kh3.exe into there as well, then run the uasset batch. It will dump the contents of every .uasset as necessary. Afterwards, take kh3.exe, the new raw folder, and the umap batch and move them to the umap folder. Run that batch and it will generate a complete set of meshes.

If anyone wants it as well, here is a complete(?) list of pawns in KH3 that I touched up upon acquiring the models. It includes weapons, bosses, enemies, NPCs, and PCs.

I tried it on the .pak for A Fragmentary Passage and I get this: File name: 'D:\Geek Squad Data Backup\00250287445177gm\Users\Jake\Downloads\KHHD28FCP\EP0082-CUSA05787_00-KINGçDOMHEARTSX28-A0100-V0100\CUSA05787\tresgame\content\paks\tresgame-ps4.uexp'

Also, could you provide us with some sound files from KH III as well? I'd like to start with the ambience files first.

They get exported as ascii format correct?

I used XPS to import the files I got from UMAP but I only get like one mesh :L
I'm pretty sure I am doing this wrong

https://drive.google.com/open?id=1roxHm ... lEgWnX7mEr
Download this and extract the batch files to the mesh folder of a map. Copy kh3.exe into there as well, then run the uasset batch. It will dump the contents of every .uasset as necessary. Afterwards, take kh3.exe, the new raw folder, and the umap batch and move them to the umap folder. Run that batch and it will generate a complete set of meshes.

That's because kh3.exe is made for KH3.

Not quite everything. I can’t extract the sound files from it.

New version.

- fixed some maps crashes
- vertex color output for maps
- materials output for maps

you'll have to re-convert all static models to get material names from them
after that, it will work as before
if there will be no material list, it will generate "submesh_1_material"-like names

Would you be able to make it so you can drag the .UASSET files onto the exe and convert them by the bulk, instead of one by one??

Copy and paste this into a .bat file.
for /r . %%g in (*.uasset) do whatever.exe "%%g"

Change the .uasset to whatever the format you're aiming to use is, and the .exe to whatever the exe is called.
Put it in the same folder and just run the batch, it'll run the program on every file thats in the brackets.

And what about the sound files? Anything to support extracting or converting them into making them playable.

Make a text document, paste that code into it, changing the .exe string to kh3.exe for example.
Save that txt document. Rename it from .txt to .bat.
Put it in the same folder as the kh3.exe, which is also in the same folder as the assets you want to convert.
Then double click the .bat file and it should start converting all the .uassets in that file.
It depends if you want to convert things folder per folder.
This isn't the *best* way to do this, but if its just for you to generally understand .bat files, this might be a good start.

Hello there  Thanks i actually found a previous comment with the Bat files already made up and know what to do now, though i cannot seem to convert the umap files by bulk, only the uasset files

Hmm.
So long as you change the text inside the .bat file from .uasset to .umap everything should work perfectly.

I made a typo on my .umap batch. You need to edit it and change ".map" to ".umap".

Is their any chance that mesh normals and props positions can be fixed? I noticed most of my extractions of the maps, the mesh normals on some meshes will be inverted(and yes I flipped them but there'll be weird black spots or shadows? Recalculated or removing doubles ruins the mesh iirc) and props will be positioned incorrectly.

I don't know if this has been addressed but there is a strange issue with texturing the models in Blender. At first I thought they didn't appear but upon closer inspection I saw that they were there just under a heavy layer of black all over the model. Can anyone explain this?

i dont know about any issues. From maps that i checked, mesh normals and props positions are ok

Then I guess its me then? lol

I'm importing the UMAP converted ascii files with XPS 1.8.4 - Blender 2.79

IIRC when I looked at twilight town. The props going up to the train station looked positioned weirdly and three pieces of the tram's tracks and the station and mansion had mesh normals inverted. Uhh some materials weren't named I think and some materials when applying the texture it's named isn't actually its texture.

I can't check every map. Also I dont have the game and have no idea whats twilight town and how it must look.
If something need to be fixed, i need exact file names and submesh numbers or screenshots of what is wrong.

p.s. normals will be fixed next version, i just forgot to apply them properly

I can't check every map. Also I dont have the game and have no idea whats twilight town and how it must look.
If something need to be fixed, i need exact file names and submesh numbers or screenshots of what is wrong.

p.s. normals will be fixed next version, i just forgot to apply them properly

What about character textures? pretty much all the models I rip have had inverted face textures (like transparent textures or just broken textures in blender) or textures that just dont appear?

or is that an issue with something else? and also, any like ingame particle effects or sound files, like dialogue or battle sounds we can get ahold of? or are those entirely different files

[EDIT - I also noticed that some texture filenames (Destiny Islands for Example, Pla_LeafA 01_D) do not match the Material Names or just dont even exsist & its named something like "Pla_GrassA_D". I dont know exactly what it was but its definitely an issue.]

Well the thing is...

Some textures aren't in the game files(The current dump that is available atm). Keep in mind Destiny islands and the Mysterious tower are cutscene maps and possibly cut content used for cutscene only. 

So it's understandable that not everything is included. If you pulled out Yen Sid's tower. Majority of the textures for the tower itself and terrain are not included.

The current dump is a full game dump. If some textures are missing, it means they are not present in game.

and also, any like ingame particle effects or sound files
as far as i know, all other files can be converted with standard tools
umodel can get textures, and detailed info about which textures used in each material etc
i haven't heard about any problems with them

sounds are also standard

Does anyone know where one can get access to original game files for characters?
some people who port models are negligent and omit important textures like specular maps, so if anyone could point me to where i could get actual files  to do it myself, it would be appreciated.

The UV's work fine for all the meshes I've extracted so far.
do you have a mesh with no UV's?
Textures can be dumped with umodel the standard way.

Yeah I'm not finding any problems using 3dsMax + MarioKart's updated XNA script that imports Daemon's ascii format.

However, I am finding a bunch of missing textures e.g Buzz's wing/legs. I either got a bad rip from someone or these really aren't in the game :/

Change to UV2 or UV3. For example, I had Woody look like [this](https://i.imgur.com/FwaX5gy.png) but switching to UV2 resulted in a [fixed Woody](https://i.imgur.com/Y9ise63.png).

I've read those too, the files they've referenced for me seem to just be missing or they reference textures that don't align with UVs.

For example, Buzz's wing/foot texture inst.txt says that it should be d00, but thats the texture for his body which clearly doesnt fit the other section of him. And it says the normal is n01, which is a proper UV'd normal but the diffuse doesnt seem to exist.

Try changing your UV set, its very likely thats the issue here.
The Uv's come out fine but there are often 2-3 UV channels, and the texture only uses one of those.

Nothing is outdated, what ever you have means everyone has same game files, pretty much it means that who ever shared game files with you did not include the audio files as well or what ever else was missing.

Hi all.

I am having some issues with texture extraction. I'm sure it's something simple that I am overlooking, so any help would be great.



unknown.png (26.91 KiB) Viewed 206 times



This is the setting I was told to use by someone in a discord channel. I looked through this thread but wasn't able to find any information about the actual settings for textures.

The result is a list of textures not found.

Please advise.

Download the latest update of uModel & Select Kingdom Hearts 3 instead of Unreal Engine 4.17 and make sure you have PS4 selected at all times

I actually figured it out. The figure I was trying to find is Aqua, and I was looking in the NPC folder. But Aqua's textures are in the player's folder instead.

I actually figured it out. The figure I was trying to find is Aqua, and I was looking in the NPC folder. But Aqua's textures are in the player's folder instead.

Oh okay, well then i would recommend using the Aqua model from the Player folder just because it may be more up to date (just a tiny bit)

I am sorry if I have missed this, but I have looked and found no answer. How do I load KH3 into umodel, I have the iso from the disk as well as the pkg file. both wont show anything. Do I need to extract the pkg? I was not able to do that with the pkg took out there.

also, How do I use the Kingdom hearts 3 tool from Deamon? did I miss a readme somewhere?

I would be most grateful for any insight and help. Thanks!

Not just KH3 models but any UE game assets you can follow the actual devs tutorial/example here: [https://www.youtube.com/c/KonstantinNosov](https://www.youtube.com/c/KonstantinNosov)

It doesn't work that way, any game released beyond 5.05/5.07 firmware for PS4 needs an exploit and none exists public, thus games you see like KH3 have game files that are already dumped/decrypted with the private exploit, wondering around among people ready to be used, otherwise what you have is useless because keys to decrypt these game PKGs do not exist, only a PS4 can do it for now internally.

You simply drag and drop any desired character on to the tool and you'll get converted ASCIIs of that character.

Thank you for the insight. So If i understand correctly, A decrypted/dumped .pkg is necessary to grab the unreal assets and all the other files. and the methods to decrypt the KH3 pkg are all private at the moment? 
Is there anything more I  can do, or that you can point me towards, to educate myself and further this project. 
Thanks again!

Correct, but not just for that game in particular, all games on higher firmware have the same faith.
Its how the PS4 hacking scene/community operates at the moment, not sure if it will change anytime soon in order not to get in trouble with Sony legally.
And no one can do anything about it unless your a well established hacker that can literally hack anything including a PS4 with out a hitch.

Thank you Mono 24. This helps focus the scope of my project.
It did take a while before KH2FM  had functionally exploreable assets and tools, and while that is a different time and technology, I think there are lots of things we will discover with KH3.
I hope I am not breaking ediquitte or infringing on the rules, but I will risk the question.
I am looking for the mesh for the dark margin map and destiny islands map. in addition I would also like the chair from the Room of repose. If anybody could point the way to them that would be nice, however I do not expect it.
I am grateful for the information already received. if anything, it saves a tremendous amount of time.

Hmm, good point I didn't download the pkg for extract stuff.
The other, is if they make the game steam, but, they have not news about it.
Still, at least I got the Gumi Phone from XNALara, now they only need is to export Heartless and weapons and I can say I will be happy. But I'm already are with existend models.

I would dearly love Kingdom Hearts on PC, but I am not getting my hopes up. we can always hope though. FFXV was pretty awesome with NVIDIA special effects, and the unreal engine is originally for x86 systems to begin with. If rumors are true, KH3 would run pretty nice on the PS5. either way, fingers crossed for a KH3 with a solid 60 fps.

on a side note. I personally wished they had implemented HDR in the game, FFXV used great HDR lighting techniques with the luminous engine. Twilight town would be a whole new experience with  that technology if implemented properly.

Hi all, 

Wanna check with everyone if you still have the Kingdom Hearts game files? I got a version with only the character folder, and am currently looking for the rest of them. 

I would appricate it if you can pass them to me if you still have them. Thank you.

Hopefully, somebody who does have a rip of the game can share the original character model files and texture files to make things easier for ripping assets

Download this and extract the batch files to the mesh folder of a map. Copy kh3.exe into there as well, then run the uasset batch. It will dump the contents of every .uasset as necessary. Afterwards, take kh3.exe, the new raw folder, and the umap batch and move them to the umap folder. Run that batch and it will generate a complete set of meshes.

Wow I go away for a bit and people already have models and maps from the game. Progress was so fast! Is there any chance you could re-upload or relink the google drive link? I'm curious to see what it is and it broke.

I saw some people having issues with UV maps. I'm having them with Kairi. Did you guys have to split up the grouped meshes for her UV maps to work right?

UVs are fine on everything.

Most models have multiple UVs. Just double check each UV Map in blender.

It was a pair of batch files I made that batch converted all the maps and models you tossed at it instead of having to do them one at a time. I got distracted by other projects so I never finished helping make a better solution. Unfortunately, I don't even have those batch files anymore and I'm not interested in recreating them since it was hacky and didn't work 100% of the time. One of them was also broken because of a typo I made but dozens of people already had it and were constantly asking me why it didn't work.

Would anyone on here be kind enough to DM me a link to where I can get an extracted/decrypted dump of base KH3 please? I'd like to do some digging and gather models for my own personal reference but like a dummy I allowed my PS4 to update to 7.02 so RIP CFW. If sending me a full dump is out of the question, the one model I'm looking for the most is Ultima Weapon (w_so190) because im curious on how some of the materials were set up on that thing.

Many thanks in advance!

Can somebody please send me the KH3 dump? I would like to try to rip some models that I can't find ports of. If you can't send me the full dump, could I at least get the texture files for the Gigas. I found an XNAlara port of them, but some texture files were missing.

Thanks!

Not for being a dutch bag,  but it is highly impossible they will share the files, lesser on public for the rules of Xentax has.
And on private, well, just gonna say "good luck".

Yeah I wouldn't dare distribute them further, I wanna study how SE set up some shaders and use the keyblade models as prop reference, some of those are really fun to try and build as a physical thing.

Looking at the files won't help you very much with understanding how they setup their shaders honestly.
You'll just learn that they use a few different textures (of which are unlikely to be well labeled so it might be difficult to be 100% sure what the various maps are anyway).

You wouldn't be able to view shader code, or see how the material was actually organised in the original game engine before compile.

I have more than enough experience in UE4 to basically RE the shader once I see how the base materials are set up and what plugs into where, I know my way around various types of texture maps too so guessing how certain ones are used wont be that hard once im able to see them, I just actually need the files to do so in the first place.

There is way more information than you think. The stuff Umodel spits out is not everything in the cooked files.
If someone gave me the game map files I could write a program that would import maps and generate fully applied materials in UE4.

If someone gave you the files, sure you could write a program that'd import the maps and apply all the textures.
But you couldn't make something that'd do it 1:1.

The information spat out by umodel isn't doing much to explain  the various constant values, or which material functions are being called inside a material.

Sure you'll know what textures it uses, and whether its opaque or transparent, you won't ever know if they're using index pixel normal for refflections or whether or not they're using Volume based translucency for the depth.

You'll be able to get something similar but theres an almost 0% chance you'll be able to get a 1:1 with the original game.
Its true there is more information in the cooked files, but it still won't tell you everything, you'll basically never end up with the exact same node setup  as the original material had.

And thats without counting things like Enlighten.

I'm a Technical Artist working primarily with unreal and even for me there isn't enough to go on in extracted files from unreal games.

The base material isn't accessible, its just a bunch of compiled code
You wouldn't get to see what plugs into where, the packed files aren't remotely like they are in normal unreal.
For a game like this they used a bunch of custom nodes too, with their own HSL, you wouldn't be able to view any of that code, or be entirely sure of its result, you wouldn't really even know there was a custom node, but slides from production show that there were.

Aye I get what you are saying, and under normal circumstances I would agree 100%, however, I do have a history of seeing links and patterns where others might not, in matters like this I'm pretty good and consistent in getting things 99% accurate, especially when I feel passionate about something, like I am about some of these models (especially Ultima Weapon, that glittery effect is too good and I want it xD). I just really enjoy looking at these things and doing this kind of thing.

So like theres a bunch of Models from ReMind that have been uploaded to Deviant Art, yet nobody has mentioned anything about getting the files.

Such a shame TBH

Yeah I can see how that can be frustrating, googling around hasn't really helped either, I know things cant be directly posted on here because the ban hammer would fall pretty fast, just wish there was SOMEWHERE that could host them or someone with a CFW PS4 that wouldn't mind fetching some specific files for people, because lets face it, the full unpacked version of the game is probably HUGE.

I think people who have files think its still too early to share them.

With the recent release of ReMind I can see that being a real possibility.

Would still be nice if there was a repo of base game content somewhere but the likelihood of that is basically 0, which is a shame because as of right now im only interested in the weapon models so I can make screen accurate prop references and actual props for fun as well as a bit of study that I have mentioned before (really intrigued by that Ultima/X-blade sparkle shader/material they have going on)

We need the decrypted eboot.bin or the AES encryption key for the .pak files. Currently, this dump is useless still. But it's progress. If you want access, ask people in the PS4 scene for help. There's only so much the KH hacking group can do right now.

I don't suppose anyone knows the AES key for the PAK files inside the pkg I just extracted, umodel is asking for an AES key to access the files.

The only people who have it, or the ability to bypass it via decrypted eboot.bin, are the ones who originally dumped the KH3 files back in September. They don't want to share it though, so until they do or someone finds a way to make KH3 backwards compatible with a previous CFW that's PUBLIC, you cannot extract the pak files.

yeah, from what ive seen, KH3's minimum firmware requirement is OFW 6.02, IIRC there are public CFW jailbreaks for 6.45-ish? Also if you need the eboot.bin at all send me a PM, unless you already have it of course xD ill attempt to take a look into it but I have VERY limited knowledge on encryption, though im not sure if my eboot is encrypted or not.

KH3 was compiled using 5.50 SDK, so a minimum CFW of 5.50 is required. It can't be userland though. It has to be a full kernel exploit. As for the eboot, I have it as well, but mine is definitely encrypted. Try to dump your pak files with UnrealPak. It will tell you if it's encrypted or not. If you somehow do have a decrypted one, send it my way and I'll make sure it gets to where it needs to go in order to kickstart a major wave of research and modding utilities.

yeah any kind of PAK tool for those is going to ask for the key, my eboot is probably encrypted too as I got it out of app.pkg on my PC using the released read code and the LibOrbis tool thing, so we might be in the same boat, hopefully either someone is kind enough to release the AES key or we get a decrypted eboot dump soon.

Hi, i have recently acquired Kingdom Hearts 3 character files with all the uassets, mesh works fine but textures won't show

or even export properly it's like the software doesn't export the full texture

 i tried everything i could think of changing platform compatiblity textures format i tried updating my graphics card driver it did not work, iv tried opening only one character file and the textures show of properly on some characters

but still export the same here some screenshot of the results and ue viewer 
if that help i got and nvidia gpu (rtx 2070) and a gtx 750ti and i tried with both and got the same results

This is because of how KH3 handles textures. If you read earlier in the thread, you would know that's normal.
Fix your "imgur.com/undefined" links. Textures export fine with Umodel and most have, even before KH3 support was added.
Nothing you do will "fix" it because there is nothing wrong. Don't use Umodel to examine KH3 files. Use it to export them. It's that simple.

Why are you so interested in the total map polycount?
You never see the entire map at once, and the entire map wouldn't ever be loaded into the engine at a single time, so the total map polycount doesn't matter so much.
But its almost certainly going to be around 100-300million triangles at a guess.

Too bad we still can't do anything other than pirate the game now. That firmware can't decrypt the eboot or pak files, so literally the only thing that's been accomplished is random stray assets and piracy now.

The models are in the game. They're just vertex edits of Terra's armor, however.

It is not allowed to share public links of full game data on Xentax, only samples, aka, very small data.
On private is another history were they can, but, figure out if they will give data of xxxx game data to anyone.

I am currently having issues unpacking my .pkg files using PS4PKGViewer. Any tips for a noob?

I extracted the .pkg files with PkgEditor-0.1.223 from here [https://ci.appveyor.com/project/maxton/ ... /artifacts](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/maxton/liborbispkg/build/artifacts)

Now I'm stuck getting anything from the .pak files, any help would be appreciated.
Thank you.

Is there a list of which files correspond to which character?  I.E. I know n_fz201 is Anna (pure luck figuring that out, it was the first character I tried the tool on), but don't want to have to extract every set to know the rest.

This is amazing, I'm far from being skilled enough to do something like this, but I was wondering if you folks were able to pull fonts from the game assets, I have been looking for KH fonts for years... Especially the cutscenes comics font and the KH3 system typo (more recently), 

thank you very much

"How" isn't the question. It's "when". They're encrypted, and people are hoarding the decrypted eboot.bin needed to obtain the key and decrypt the paks. If you want it, ask people in the PS4 scene. Nobody outside of it has been able to decrypt the paks.

New version released. Now supports textures and auto-texture loading for maps. It will work for Kingdom Hearts 3 and for some other games.

You can use the tool to convert individual assets, or all assets in a folder.

1. To convert one asset, drop asset file onto the tool, or run the tool from command line with asset filename as parameter.

If asset file contains a texture, in will be exported to "textures" subfolder in Directx10 DDS format. After that you can convert them to the format you like.

If asset file contains static or skeletal mesh, in will be exported to ASCII. Raw data will also be saved in "staticmesh.raw" & "skeletalmesh.raw" folders for later use in map extraction.

If asset file contains a material, it will create "material.db" file with information for later use in map extraction. If "material.db" file already exists next to the tool, it will be updated with newly found materials.

If asset file contains a blueprint, it will create "blueprint.db" file with information for later use in map extraction. If "blueprint.db" file already exists next to the tool, it will be updated with newly found blueprints.

2. To convert all assets in a folder, place the tool in that folder and run it. Tool will search that folder and all subfolders for .uasset files and try converting them all. When prompted "are you sure?" you can press "enter" to confirm or Ctrl-C to cancel.

3. To convert maps, drop .umap file onto the tool, or run the tool from command line with umap filename as parameter. Current version will extract static meshes, skeletal meshes, blueprint-generated meshes, lights and landscapes from a map.

For map extraction to work, "staticmesh.raw" and "skeletalmesh.raw" folders with previously extracted data must be in the same folder with the tool. If some models will be missing, tool will give messages.

If "blueprint.db" file will be next to the tool, it will try and place all models mentioned in blueprints on the map. There's no proper blueprint support, so some models may be placed incorrectly.

If "material.db" file will be next to the tool, material information from that file will be used to place texture names in the output ASCII file, so when loaded, all textures will be applied automatically. By default, ASCII file will have texture names with ".PNG" format. If you converted textures to another format (for example .JPG), you need to replace ".png" to ".jpg" in ASCII file with any text editor before loading it.

If there will be no "material.db" file, or some materials will be missing in that file, tool will give messages and material names will be used for textures. In that case you can search and apply them manually. Some models do not use any textures (for example, solid color materials or lights). For such models ascii file will also have material name as texture name, so if you want, you can open that material in umodel and see whats the color and other properties.

Tool updated:

- blueprints "workaround" support
- instanced static mesh support
- lights export
- materials with no textures dont make error messages anymore

note: blueprints are not properly supported, because i'm not going to read their code at all. This would be just too complicated. Since most blueprints just have 1 mesh inside and some logic, i'm assuming they are simply placing that mesh. In reality, the mesh position may be edited or calculated accoridng to game logic, or removed at all - this is all NOT supported.

For skeletal models to have textures auto-loaded on the map, you'll have to re-export them.

hello, I put the material.db, base materials, and basematerialinstance in the same folder with the umaps. I wasn't sure what I needed to all be together? still says missing materials on export so I'm confused on where the exported materials need to go? sorry

sorry, I'm asking how does it extract along with the umap? where does the location of the necessary files need to be? for example, I move the exe in the Material folder with the material.db and and drag the .umap to export in there, but it still says it can't find anything.

Location of files doesn't matter. Material folder also not needed.
The only file needed during .umap extraction is material.db.
Whats the size of your material.db?

130kb from doing only bt/uasset/materials. there were no errors in cmd as far as I could tell.. all the extracted materials were put in BaseMaterials and BaseMaterialInstance folders.

so for clarity, all the textures are in bt\uasset\material and material.db after running the exe. Folders staticmesh and staticmesh.raw are in bt\umap\bt_01, after extracting them from meshes and then moving them into the umap folder. I got the files from a friend so idk if the organization of the folders are different but I can convert umap fine? ?

Concerning the material.db, you're saying I leave it where it is ? or move the kh3.exe somewhere else to convert??

This is fine.

For map extraction:
- you DONT need BaseMaterials and BaseMaterialInstance folders
- you DONT need any textures
- you DONT need staticmesh Folder

All you need is:
1. kh3.exe
2. material.db file
3. staticmesh.raw folder
4. umap+uexp of a map you want to extract

It DOESNT matter where (in which folder) all these files are.

Somebody asked me to make it possible that source files will be in one folder, and extracted map go to some other folder, and i made it possible. But now, to make it simple, lets forget about it. For sure, you have to place all needed files (listed 1,2,3,4 above) to one folder, and then drop umap onto EXE or run EXE from command line with 1 parameter - umap file.

This must work. If it doesnt, send me output text or screenshot.

Oh!! I didn't realize the texture folder needed to be converted. at least the material.db worked for names because there was a .dds file needed instead of no extension (which was causing my confusion). I thought it did it through the materials or something ;; 

Got it working now, thank you for helping! and thanks for working on this tool ;w;

Character models were handed out to modelers and artists, and they passed them out to other people. Some of us have the complete set of pak files, but we can't decrypt them because the PS4 scene won't share the decrypted eboot or the key. I agree that it sucks, but it is what it is. Even with offering money and telling people I won't share the decrypted eboot file because I only want to research the files, I still was turned down by many people who have it.

You are wrong.
Not only "Character models", but the complete set of decrypted pak files were handed out.
I have no idea why you still dont have them, probably because of your strange obsession with eboot.
It seems that you're not interested in decrypted files, just the eboot.
Also you somehow have weird idea about how "many people" have it.

With the decrypted eboot, I can unpack the files myself and backporting to public CFW for mod support can commence. I have also not met a single person who has 100% of the pak file contents that is willing to hand them out, you included. My "obsession" isn't strange, and I'm absolutely interested in decrypted files. That's why I asked you for decrypted eboot in PM.
Edit: I also didn't claim "only" character models were handed out. That's just the overwhelming majority of what got passed around. Almost nobody has anything except character models. It's very clear that people have been curating what files get handed out. There's zero evidence to suggest otherwise.

Overwhelming majority? This means you dont know what was handed out. It was 100% of the pak file contents.

Edit: I also didn't claim "only" character models were handed out. That's just the overwhelming majority of what got passed around
Overwhelming majority? This means you dont know what was handed out. It was 100% of the pak file contents.

All the artists and "collectors" and whatnot that I and many other people have asked keep telling us they only have character models and very occasionally do they say they have maps as well. You're reading into what I'm saying too hard and avoiding the main points, which are: 
1) I need the eboot to get the decryption key to the pak files myself (since nobody, including you, again, will just point someone to the complete decrypted dump of the game, eboot included) and make game mods.
2) The entire decrypted pak contents have very clearly, based on all the responses in this forum, in various Discord servers, all over Twitter, and so on point toward curation of which files got distributed and to whom. Finding the complete KH3 dump in the wild is inconceivably harder than finding the complete 0.2 dump.

Since I shared the PKG key publicly, a lot of people were able to achieve modding and research of unused content. The entirety of my save editor has been created thanks to that. And not only.

I strongly believe that information should be shared to let other people do more. After all your KH3 tool is based on something that has been given to you.
Still just a partial dump is floating around to lucky people. The game is out since 1 year and a half and the attention already shifted to other games.

I respect your work, but people can not use your tools because those files are not shared. I know it does not depend by you, but someone has to do something about it at some point. Handing the AES key, as I did for the passcode, would be ideal for everyone.

I don't think that you understand the purpose of this forum and tools at all. This is a 3D/2D subforum, so most tools here will just operate on suitable model related game files only. The means of getting those files though is user`s responsibility. No matter if its publicly available or not. This isn't a file sharing forum.

Do you need help with the AES key or general encryption? Then you would open a thread in the related section and try to get help. This thread/tool clearly doesn't deal with the encryption part of the game.

Sorry that this seems like directed to you, but actually it is directed to all people asking for keys constantly on this kind of 3D tool/script threads. There is a place for everything.

so, i'm trying to convert a map from the dlc and using this tool gives me a ".Missing Model: ....." error, and outputs a few .txt files but doesn't actually give me any more info than that...

There's multiple .umap models in this folder and they all give me the same or similar results...

Make sure to convert all the UASSETs in the model folder. Take the staticmesh.raw and put it into the same folder as the UMAP then drag .UMAP file to the tool. It works just fine

yeah im doing that exactly and all i'm getting is some text files.
sometimes there aren't even errors on them...
I checked the staticmesh.raw folder and there's 436 files in there, which matches the amount of uasset files in the zip file i was given, so I don't think i'm missing anything...

It's just a shame not to share anything and keep everything for myself, I'm very disappointed to know that the hacking resource scene is becoming individualistic and that people no longer share anything. Again, I still haven't figured out how these people managed to get the cards, when the only one available was only the characters. Finally, hey, I don't see the usefulness of this program except for 5% of people who use it and still don't use it as it should.

I don't have the files myself but I understand people not wanting to share them. This is copyrighted content we're speaking about, of course people will only share that kind of stuff with people they can trust or have some kind of proof of modding activities or whatever. 
You can't just expect to come into the scene without knowing anyone and expect them to give you all you want directly, especially when some people are not who they're pretending to be. Also if the PS4 scene would share the exploit they use to get these files it'd just be patched out and there'd be no way to get future games

I was told the same thing chose for the characters and searching I found someone who give it to me. 
Certainly you have to trust the people to whom to give, in the meantime it is often the people who want to do the things of good will who are the last. I will not change my opinion on my last comment.

Those are totally valid points, but I haven't seen anyone here pretending to be someone they aren't. I directly work with a group of people that wants these files for research purposes. Look up OpenKH. We're organizing all the information we can right now about every game, and we hope KH3 can be one of the games we work with. That's the only reason I specifically want these files. Plus, actual mod support of course, since I and every OpenKH contributor so far are established modders in the KH scene.
I still respect the decision to not share it, but what I personally don't agree with is dropping only a portion and then holding the rest back from those who intend to use all of it for projects. I guess it is what it is though. I'll have to agree to disagree with the choices of people in the PS4 scene.

I'm handling KH3 situation the same way I did for all other PS4 exclusives:

I made tools, and made sure that some people in KH community have all decrypted data files.

I don't have time or intention to regulate sharing of files inside your community. Its up to community to decide that. I could only suggest, as usual, to share with friends, with people you know.

sorry I keep having issues but I exported the shibuya scene properly and imported it int blender and the materials are all wrong 

none of them are named, they just say "Submesh_[num]" and they only have a single diffuse texture which is using the materials' name rather than the texture name so I cant assign them automatically.
For a huge scene like this i'd greatly prefer not to apply each texture manually... is there a way to get it exported properly?

You are joke, you can see that there are people in this community who want these resources, you can see that most of them insist, and you continue to once again have ignored people's requests. Certainly, we can not distinguish honest people and those who are false, but at some point you have to have the hacking spirit that is to say that when we find something we share. The hacking world has lost all the sharing side and prefers to keep everything for them. I find it so sad and unfair for the modding community, and for those who also want to study the source files of the game. There is only one person who has to share these resources (Characters exclusively) and I can thank him infinitely.

i realized that the tool I was using was extremely outdated, but downloading the latest version just straight up doesn't work on these files...

ugh, i'm annoyed now. Does anyone have older versions of the program? Specifically the one on Apr. 24th [viewtopic.php?p=162503#p162503](https://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?p=162503#p162503) 

here? I want to try it on these files aswell.

Bro read up, I don't have the files myself lol, I'm not even interested in that game. But your entitled attitude probably won't solve anything. The "hacking world" as you say is sharing those resources but only to people they trust and I perfectly understand that, especially seeing how annoying some beggars are. Of course they are some AW who're just lucky to know the right guys but again these guys know the right people because they've been in the scene for a while
Just get involved in the community, produce some tools and then you'll get some stuff that's it, why would you be entitled to get these files ?

It is not only for me but it is also for the community that I speak, mainly for modders. In any case, I know that I will not get the game files, that I am bad or good it will not change anything.

That is the luck.
One could have luck of find good person that don't see you as an anon or people that even if you were the most important person on the world, they will not move a finger for your request.

Hacker community doesn't exist in years, heck, even here.
But, they're right on not trust anyone, I've seeing enough Patreon people using the models that they didn't made for win money, not to mentioned the porn ones using models on Patreon or any other web.

Things is, it is smarter for find it one by one self the data of XXXX game, I did that way with not just KH in general speaking, but many games, I mean, if it were for that, they will already give me the Passcode for Medievil and as your community; experiment with the data. but they will not, because they will not trust what I will do with the models or data.

But hey, they is always "luck" to meet the right person, too.

Considering that there is no one to donate the rest of the resources, I ask my question again. How many total polycount there is in the world map of Olympus ? 
If someone asks me the question to know the number of polycount, it's just to have a precise idea on the map.

Thanks.

New version released. Now supports textures and auto-texture loading for maps. It will work for Kingdom Hearts 3 and for some other games.

You can use the tool to convert individual assets, or all assets in a folder.

1. To convert one asset, drop asset file onto the tool, or run the tool from command line with asset filename as parameter.

If asset file contains a texture, in will be exported to "textures" subfolder in Directx10 DDS format. After that you can convert them to the format you like.

If asset file contains static or skeletal mesh, in will be exported to ASCII. Raw data will also be saved in "staticmesh.raw" & "skeletalmesh.raw" folders for later use in map extraction.

If asset file contains a material, it will create "material.db" file with information for later use in map extraction. If "material.db" file already exists next to the tool, it will be updated with newly found materials.

If asset file contains a blueprint, it will create "blueprint.db" file with information for later use in map extraction. If "blueprint.db" file already exists next to the tool, it will be updated with newly found blueprints.

2. To convert all assets in a folder, place the tool in that folder and run it. Tool will search that folder and all subfolders for .uasset files and try converting them all. When prompted "are you sure?" you can press "enter" to confirm or Ctrl-C to cancel.

3. To convert maps, drop .umap file onto the tool, or run the tool from command line with umap filename as parameter. Current version will extract static meshes, skeletal meshes, blueprint-generated meshes, lights and landscapes from a map.

For map extraction to work, "staticmesh.raw" and "skeletalmesh.raw" folders with previously extracted data must be in the same folder with the tool. If some models will be missing, tool will give messages.

If "blueprint.db" file will be next to the tool, it will try and place all models mentioned in blueprints on the map. There's no proper blueprint support, so some models may be placed incorrectly.

If "material.db" file will be next to the tool, material information from that file will be used to place texture names in the output ASCII file, so when loaded, all textures will be applied automatically. By default, ASCII file will have texture names with ".PNG" format. If you converted textures to another format (for example .JPG), you need to replace ".png" to ".jpg" in ASCII file with any text editor before loading it.

If there will be no "material.db" file, or some materials will be missing in that file, tool will give messages and material names will be used for textures. In that case you can search and apply them manually. Some models do not use any textures (for example, solid color materials or lights). For such models ascii file will also have material name as texture name, so if you want, you can open that material in umodel and see whats the color and other properties.

i tried to convert a umap file from kh0.2 (aqua episode when she is in the world of darkness) but the software gives me 3 text files and nothing else, is that normal or no ?

EDIT:
i tried to do run kh3.exe in the map folder but he keep giving me this error (screenshot)

translation of the french part: The index is outside the limits of the table

downloading the latest version just straight up doesn't work on these files...
Yes, last version was broken. When adding proper support for landscapes i accidentally switched off map output.
Fixed version updated in the first post.

Anyone have the Anna bunad model without her cape and hat? The one I found off DeviantART was released with a rather contradictory set of licences (WTFPL and then there's a restriction on using said model on anything violent) and as such I'd like to have a clean rip.

Here is a screen of the folder and the error message, sorry my mistake it did begin with ' i ' and not ' ? '... Rapunzel's Scenes are the only one I see doing it ( I didn't try all the maps... ) I hope it will help you, even if it's my mistake for doing anything wrong. :3

So I've finally gotten umodel mostly working with everything, but I was wondering, is there a way to get the right texture on the mdl folder assets within the effects folder? I'm trying to study how KH3 does their effects in hopes of learning techniques to apply to my own effects.

Umodel + 3DSMax + Actorx importer plugin for 3dsmax.

All you need is to load the models with umodel. One of the option says find animations. Export the model. Load 3dsmax and run actorx importer script. Import the psk of the model then PSA file

thank you but I'm talking about the Re:Mind DLC, not the game PKG. I tried using the decryption key used for the game, but it didn't work with the DLC.

this is what I've done:
- downloaded the 4 parts of the pkg for the Re:Mind DLC from 
- combined the 4 parts using PKG Editor, I got a single file (about 13.2GB) named JP0082-CUSA11060_00-KHX30DLC00000003.pkg
- tried to open this file using again PKG Editor, providing the same key used for the KH3 pkg (starting with "p2gxi..")

it says invalid passcode

it says invalid passcodeOkay, yeah, sounds like you're downloading the Japanese version's DLC files with the English voices built-in instead (which also explains the larger file size). That one seems to have a different key (which is why you're having trouble with it), but fear not as those those aren't actually necessary, since all of the content there is included with the US version and its update.

The one that you're looking for should have only three parts, and has the ID "UP0082-CUSA12031_00-KINGDOMHEARTSX30-A0110-V0100". That one should work with the key, and the following PAKs should have the Re:Mind DLC models and such:
```
pakchunk0-ps4_2_p.pak
pakchunk0-ps4_3_p.pak
pakchunk0-ps4_4_p.pak
pakchunk0-ps4_5_p.pak
pakchunk0_s1-ps4_3_p.pak
pakchunk0_s2-ps4_3_p.pak

Hey Guys sorry if this question is asked twice but I couldn't find it anywhere. So is there a chance of getting anything in UE4? I'd like to do some stuff. So if there's any chance let me know.

- Post Title: Re: Kingdom Hearts 3 (PS4)

So let me get this straight:

I read this forum thread from page one to the latest, and people seem to be asking for the game files left and right, something about .pak files from a certain firmware version and above are still encrypted, something about a (seemingly strange, according to some of the posts) need for a decrypted eboot.bin.

Might sound noob-ish, but the repeated game file posts (and some of the drama along the way, admittedly) had me somewhat confused as to what I actually need to have to use this tool. With one of the posts here stating that the key to decrypt original Sony Retail .PKG is already shared in the forum (if I had been taking down the right notes, I think have this one figured out), would this mean I also need the "base version" of the game's .pkg file for me to successfully extract the assets I'll need (specifically, I'm really only after one stage/map)? If not, what are those "game files" I'll actually need? 

Clearing it out now that I'm asking what I need, not where to find them (bonus if someone actually do point out where, but I'm more concerned about what files I'll actually need— a specific version of the game or something like that).

Any help that will point me in the right direction into using this tool will be much appreciated 
Thanks!

For anyone else on here, how do I download the latest version of kh3.exe? Also under what subset of folders are the keyblade models located?

Hello, I can decrypt the kingdom hearts 3 files, I got to the UASSETS, BUT it doesn't run on UE4, UE4 doesn't recognize the files, BUT I explored some files inside the pkg and found that inside the uroot folder the file is ue4commandline. txt

../../../TresGame/TresGame.uproject -Messaging

I open UE4 it even recognizes looking for files, but it doesn’t open files, it’s as if the files had been “corrupted” but I don’t think so, the TresGame.uproject file is perhaps the best solution, does anyone have this file?

I should drag it to the kh3.exe tool but in this case it only generates 3 documents format .txt

Hello, I have a complicated project since I'm a noob, but there it is:


I would like to create a transition screen to use when editing video. I would like the Demon Tower to slide over the screen as an alpha transition.


To do this I thought I would get the model and play the according animation (as seen during fight or Twilight Town cutscene).

I got the game files, and found the model "dw_402"


Problem is, I can't rip the texture, and huge problem for a noob like me, the model is this (attachment)


Which means the game uses dark ways to have this demon tower working. Is it possible to recreate it in a 3D software so I can get my transition?

Edit: demon tower is supposed to look like this [https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1312024/ ... c3185d105d](https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1312024/kingdom-hearts-3-demon-tower.png?w=790&f=268dbf1c782652918768b0c3185d105d)

Thanks in advance!

Oh, Vlad closed his account? I wonder what happened  Last I heard from him and his project is that they managed to get KH1 working for PC.

On the other hand, I think that also means the links and his directions are gone? I still have them and the links provided in the instructions still works (other than his twitter links, of course), but is it ok to still share the tool?

If you would have read the thread, you'd see that the simple answer is YES, you can  lots of hard work, but doable.
Since the tools for UE by daemon are reversed in same manner, the steps/procedure is the same as well, the forum has steps on how to do it written in posts, just gotta search for it.

Hi! New here! 
So every time I put a umap into the tool, it pops out three txt files. Is this suppose to happen? If so, how do I import that into a 3d program like blender?

After following those steps, you will get *.ASCII files which you get to import in Blender.

Something like this should do, for statics i think is better because for skeletals i think it does not support proper bone rotations
There are other ascii python scripts around here but cant remember what thread/post, you'll have to search for them.

If you want proper help, you must provide exact steps of what you did and why you got that error, follow closely, carefully, don't rush, then you'll see where you missed a important step, or what ever is you did.

my step is as follows:
1.i execute the kh3.exe to all .uasset (static meshes)
2.then i execute the kh3.exe to .umap files

its just i use the application for other game (PARAGON) some of the maps work without error

THKS!!

I did the exact same thing running kh3.exe in uasset but didn't get any new files at all like materials.db or the .ascii files in that 2nd image
could anyone help?
Honestly I just need one model that is from the Toybox, which is The Cleric from Toy Story That Time Forgot
so if somebody could help me rip it that would be most helpful!! thanks
