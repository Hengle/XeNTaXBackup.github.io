the texture .pct file can be opened from a tool that exist somewhere on this forum I think..
but I found probably the latest version of the tool in moddb: [https://www.moddb.com/games/quake-champ ... /qcpct-v04](https://www.moddb.com/games/quake-champions/downloads/qcpct-v04)

some of the WWZ's 3d model .tpl file can be opened using this tool from here: [viewtopic.php?f=16&t=21734](https://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=21734)
I said 'some' because some tpl file can't be properly opened and exported out (the tool will not show any model upon loading a problematic file not will it export out the model properly).
I've only tested it WWZ player weapon asset tho..

with those 2 tool, you can export out a workable asset that you can then convert/port to other stuff
