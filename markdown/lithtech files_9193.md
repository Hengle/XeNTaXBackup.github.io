I didn't write anything for the animations, and the map files have barely been reversed so it's impossible to export to it.

Just change the export format in the dropdown list when you're exporting.

Oh, maybe 3ds wasn't there. fbx or dae should be fine though.

Which reminds me: I never actually figured out how materials were referenced in ltb files.
