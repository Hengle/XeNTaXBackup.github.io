- Post Title: (.SCR script files) Vampire Hurts conversion help

Hello. I've been stumbling through this game's files with the help of this forum. I have no experience in this, so when I saw "map0001.scr" etc I thought they would just be scripts that control the enemy, map file generation, etc. However, simply opening them in Notepad reveals that they contain the dialogue too! Man I'm dumb.

It looks like this kind of file has been posted before, so I'm hoping that this will be an easy solution (this looks like some old proprietary format?). I've attached all the files. Thanks for any help! This will probably be the last thread I have to annoy you with about this game, I feel bad about asking so many questions.
