hi, i will keep this short n sweet. i have encrypted data files i want access to, as i suspect they contain info regarding mechanical roof data for gta5 PC.. here is the only info i can gather about these files:: 

string table starts with: 0x013FE
ends at: 0x480EC
string table length : 341B

files are encrypted data files for GTA 5 PC.. i provide a encrypted example file.


its possible the file uses seperated arrays, but i cannot confirm at this point.. need more info or one of you gods to save my ass
