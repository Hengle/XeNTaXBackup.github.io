- Post Title: Nagi from Bloody Roar 4

Hi everyone! I've used the GNTools software to rip files of the Character Nagi from Bloody Roar 4. I'd need her walk and run animation. The problem is that these consist of .bone, .dff, and a.nm as well as .txd files.

Has anoyne got a clue what tool or program I can use, to see these files?   

Thanks in advance!
