- Post Title: GameCube .SSM Audio Packages

In the process of modding one of the few RenderWare 3.7 games, I wanted to see if I could make a localization patch for it. I noticed that all of the game's SFX are stored in .SSM audio packages, which are essentially .ZIP/.RAR archives of .DSP audio files that can be played in Winamp.

I've seen some GameCube games use this format, such as Super Smash Bros. Melee and Zatch Bell: Mamodo Battles. However, it seems that any tools involving .SSM files only rip .DSPs out of them, and they don't have any tool for repacking .SSM files.

Can anyone help me figure out how I can repack these files? If you need any info, including anything I can find in HxD in multiple files, let me know and I'll provide it.
