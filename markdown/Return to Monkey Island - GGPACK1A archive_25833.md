Any idea how to open these? The tools for Thimbleweed Park do NOT work, despite RtMK using the same format.

The devs behind Thimbleweed Park Explorer are working on it. They mentioned on their Github page they managed to open the encrypted files.

If you compile the recent build of Thimbleweed Park Explorer, you can extract assets. I don't think it's possible to repack stuff, though.

thank you. But it's just a file viewer. So there is no import feature.
Is there a tool or script for this?

Is it possible to put back into the game anything edited yet? I want to edit one particular background asset.
