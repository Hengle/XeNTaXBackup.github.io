- Post Title: Civilization V DDS files

Hi, I have little problem with fonts (and some other files) in Civilization V game. All images are DDS, but it seems that data inside DDS are shifted somehow or it is any strange DDS format? Anyone know how to get proper image and convert it back?

Thanx for any help or ideas.

Hm, right you are. Strange...
Well, I guess you'll have to present that issue to the fellow who created the utility.
