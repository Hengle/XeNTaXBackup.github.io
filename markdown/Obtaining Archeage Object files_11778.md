- Post Title: Obtaining Archeage Object files

There is a game that is currently in beta called "ArcheAge". They have some pretty interesting models that I would like to play around with:  [http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-yel2Q-vs0wE/U ...

I have been trying to extract models with the ninja ripper with no avail, and I have not seen any successful attempts yet. 

Has anyone tried/done anything involving Archeage models ripping? (It's on CryEngine)

For Archeage static objects use Noesis+CryTek plugin, for Player/Npc it will not work for all 100% (bones/weights aren't supported)

Sorry, but I am not experienced with Cryengine. What is the CryTek plugin, and where would I come about getting it? And yes, I googled.

I'm looking for characters and animations from Archeage also. I managed to rip off some animations using HTR export function in CryEngine SDK. I created new character (SDK Agent) with AA .caf animation list and exported it to .htr through the characters editor. Unfortunately I didn't manage to use it. Bones are screwed but it still can be used as reference or some 3d rigging masters could fix it.
