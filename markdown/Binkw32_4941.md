Hey guys:

I have a maybe a difficult question for you guys, I spend many hours on google, trying to find the header for binkw32.dll with no luck, so I came here (coz I see there are brilliant people here) and ask if you guys have this info, the functions list with params in c/c++ or delphi.

I will really appreciate any help.

Cheers,
Claudiu

Not an answer but an alternative: you can use libavcodec instead of binkw32.dll to play bink video files. Libavcodec is better documented.
