I'm new here, what happened? They're seem dead along with ripping .igb models from Xbox 360 Gold Edition ones

I heard there was a sound ripping instructions on how to ripping those sounds from PS2/PSP ones. I dunno about Wii one, alright. 

The last thing i remember that Teancum somehow able to rip Venom's sound sample and plans to rip those DLC voice,  but suddenly gave up on them for unknown reasons
