- Post Title: Poly Bridge Localization Files

Hi! I can not find the text files for Localization. 
I only found these files "guide-English, guide-French, guide-Italian...." in resources.assets files, but these texts refer only to "Guide". 
Can anyone help me find the basic text for localization of this games?
Sorry for bad English!
