Hello, I'm working on a translation for the PSVita version of The Genius of Sappherios, and since there's already a translation for the pc version I thought I might see those for ease of use.
Unfortunately the pc game (and translation) uses .pak files, and I can't figure out how to unpack them, can anyone help me? Thanks in advance.

Link for the translation .pak files: [https://www.mediafire.com/file/l0jyl7e6 ... s.rar/file](https://www.mediafire.com/file/l0jyl7e6jwbal57/GoS_Weekend_Eng_Packages.rar/file)

Well, I was working on quickbms script to unpack data from those archives, but it seems that Ekey was faster than me   

Here is Ekey's tool [https://github.com/Ekey/TH.PAK.Tool](https://github.com/Ekey/TH.PAK.Tool)

Here is my script (unfinished) [https://github.com/bartlomiejduda/Tools ... %20Weekend](https://github.com/bartlomiejduda/Tools/tree/master/NEW%20Tools/The%20Genius%20of%20Sappheiros%20Weekend)
