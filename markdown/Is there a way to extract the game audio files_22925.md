- Post Title: Is there a way to extract the game audio files?

I know there's some mods for the game, so presumably the game files can be decoded / extracted? I'd like to grab the game's music, so if there's a nice clean way to do that and preserve quality, that'd definitely be preferred.

You need to tell us title of this game. Please also send some samples to mega.nz, google drive etc.
