Hi Everyone. 
I like this game very much. I've got it from Indie Royale. It's a pity that there is no soundtrack in that bundle. The music is great. I really would like to have it on my MP3 player. Is there any way to get it?? I assume that music is in the resources.assets file. Do You know how to open it??
Thanks in advance for every answer.
