- Post Title: towards tools standarization

Hi

I've noticed there's a lot of people in here working in several tools, most of them based on homegrown libraries, etc

Also, I've seen several attempts to create a common project/tool to integrate all different efforts under the same umbrella; looks like all of them have failed, mostly because the complexity of such effort, and because most developers use different languages.

I was thinking that maybe what would be needed is some sort of foundation with a repository of base apps and interfaces so everybody could have a common base to start with, I am not talking about creating an Ã¼ber tool for everything, just agreeing to some basic APIs, namespaces and user interfaces, so everybody's tools would be more... interoperable with everybody else.

Of course, I am developing such thing myself (as everybody else, I guess) mostly in c#.

But that's not the point; I don't have the authority to push mine over everybody else, and I think this should come from a seasoned Xentax member.

So what people think? could we do this? or I'm just kicking sand again?

Cheers

Okey, looks like I'm kicking sand, so I'll keep working on my own stuff, as everybody else, I guess

Cheers
