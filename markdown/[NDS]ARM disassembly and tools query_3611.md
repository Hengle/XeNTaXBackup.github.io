- Post Title: [NDS]ARM disassembly and tools query

Does anyone here have any experience in programming the ARM of the Nintendo DS? I would be interested in learning more about this computer. Of course, I'll browse the internet for information, but I learn that little is known about disassembling ARM titles from the NDS. I know there are people out there that create homebrew apps for the NDS, but it's the decompiling I'm after, so you can actually try and mod these games. For me it is yet another challenge to tackle the file formats commonly used on that machine. 

It's a long shot, but perhaps somebody here knows something

Some weeks ago I bought a GPS navigation device for 80E.
Unfortunately the software proved to be outdated and not upgradable.
Therefore I searched for a possibility to unlock the software to be able to access the integrated hidden Windows-CE. I think I have found a solution but I don't dare to go the last step because I don't want to destroy the device.

It seems that many of these ARM-processor based pocket devices use similar Windows-CE-versions and differ only in the hardware environment.

Here are some pocketdevice related sites which might help:
