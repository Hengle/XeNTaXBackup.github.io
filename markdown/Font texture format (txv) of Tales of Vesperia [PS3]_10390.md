- Post Title: Font texture format (txv) of Tales of Vesperia [PS3]

I need some help for font texture format (txv) of Tales of Vesperia [PS3]. Does anyone know what is the texture format? I want to transilate this game. And I have found the text files with your help in this forum. The text file is similar with XB360. But the format of PS3's font texture files (*.txv) is not as same as 360's. I have tried the DXT5 format but only get some blurry shadows. Could anyone help me to take a look?

Thanks a lot. 

Here are some files: [http://ul.to/zbip4vxn](http://ul.to/zbip4vxn)
