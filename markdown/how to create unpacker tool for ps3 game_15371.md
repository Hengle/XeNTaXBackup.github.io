What's that "hdd.cpk" file for? It's not part of the game (I have it straight from PSN and that file isn't part of the download).

Anyways, try aluigi's cpk script for quickbms. 

[http://aluigi.altervista.org/quickbms.htm](http://aluigi.altervista.org/quickbms.htm)

If that doesn't work you can ask someone else to create a working script but you'll have to upload a sample using the filecutter bms script (also found in the link I posted). Nobody is going to download a 17GB game to create a script if they don't need to.
