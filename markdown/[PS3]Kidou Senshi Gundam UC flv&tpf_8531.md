Hi! everybody
Please help me
I have some flver&tpf files.
[http://www.mediafire.com/?sz3e8jg997t4dtp](http://www.mediafire.com/?sz3e8jg997t4dtp)
flver is model, tpf is texture.
How to convert flver to obj, and tpf to dds?
I don't know much, this might be helpful

Here is a lotsbiss's ACE-R flv&tpf source.
flver : [http://www.mediafire.com/?iov66t1pzj0qc7p](http://www.mediafire.com/?iov66t1pzj0qc7p)

I would imagine the flv files are similar to the ones for darksoul/armored core/ with maybe a couple different structs here and there etc
Tpf...Probably the same?

I know the flv files for armored core had a different mesh header section, but never took the time to look at it again.

Hey! mark
How do you use this source?
I'd like to know all about this source.

I don't know how to use that, either.
The situation is hopeless.

It looks like the c# codes export to obj and dds as wanted.
If you have his source wouldn't he have released a tool......? Just ask him for the exe's.
