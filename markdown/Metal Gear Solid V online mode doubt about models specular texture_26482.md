Hi all,
I was seeing models from online mode and tried replacing some models and textures, model replacement seems to work fine but I have an issue with texture replacement.  What I have found so far is that while all textures go in textures.dat file (after converting to ftex files),  some smaller version go in chunk0.dat which are the ftex and ftex.1, these in chunk0 are merely duplicate from these files in textures file, but the issue Im having is some specular textures seem to have a duplicate somewhere else because after replacing in chunk0 and textures file then specular map is still read as it was originally sometimes (lets say i edit the specular map, so the edited is not show correctly always). The effect is maybe not noticeable always, I mean, since its specular, its noticed more when raining and if metal color is equiped, makes me wonder if there are 2 specular maps per outfit somewhere or there is a duplicate somewhere else, what do you know?
