- Post Title: .xpc File?

Hi all,

I was fiddlin' around with a game I used to play called Hot Wheels Velocity X, and I came across a .xpc file. I googled it, and found next to nothing about it. It definitely isn't an Action Replay file, and I can't find anything else about it. I opened the file in Notepad and searched for a game file and found the name of it in there, which leads me to believe it's an archive or compressed file. Anyone know anything about this file, or better still, how to extract it? I won't link the file (copyrighted) but I'm sure you could find one with the info I've given... 

Any help would be awesome.
