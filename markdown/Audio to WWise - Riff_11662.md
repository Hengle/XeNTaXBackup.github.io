- Post Title: Audio to WWise - Riff?

Hey Guys, 

I want to modify the Sounds and Music of League of Legends at the moment.
Now I need a little bit help :/ I want to convert a music-file to .wwise (RIFF-Audio).
I uploaded a example-file and I want to convert a music file into this format...

[http://puu.sh/9XPLJ/3003436e42.wwise](http://puu.sh/9XPLJ/3003436e42.wwise) (Rightclick -> Save as.)
[http://puu.sh/9XPyk/12c20beaf5.ogg](http://puu.sh/9XPyk/12c20beaf5.ogg) (wwise converted to ogg)

it would be really great if you can help me with this!
