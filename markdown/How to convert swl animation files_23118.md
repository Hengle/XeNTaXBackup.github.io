- Post Title: How to convert swl animation files?

Hi, everybody 
There is a playrix game called "Wildscapes". I found out that their 2D animation file extension is in swl format.Is there any way to view its animation?
Or is there any way to view the animation here?
I am learning to make animation, thank you
Some pictures of this game are in DDS format, but they seem to be confused and I cannot view them.  Please check the Egg.zip file
