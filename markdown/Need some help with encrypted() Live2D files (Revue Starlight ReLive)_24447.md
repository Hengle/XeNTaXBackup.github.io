- Post Title: Need some help with encrypted(?) Live2D files (Revue Starlight Re:Live)

This particular game and question was last asked here 2 years ago with no definitive answer, so I decided to join and start a new thread (hello!)

The moc3 file can be opened using the official Live2D Cubism Viewer


The motions and physics files however are in a different file format (.mpac), and can't be used in the viewer



Here's how they look when opened in a text editor

Same file in regular notepad

Some of the text are present and readable, but covered with symbols, and no trace of the important numerical values


Anyone have any idea with how these could be restored to usable .json files? If possible I'd also like to know the process behind it, thanks in advance.
