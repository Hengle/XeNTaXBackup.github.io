That is an ah...interesting problem you got there, mambox. 

In my head all kinds of pr0n-spam   go off. 

Now, there's a link to a picture of a scarely dressed member of the female species. And the URL of it resembles ye olde pr0n-spam quite strikingly, were it not that the pic's been uploaded on a upload-site and it's you who's posting it. 

Still....you have an interesting goal in mind............  What tool did you use to create the interesting slide show? Don't forget to upload the final slide show somewhere

well 

place was easy and fast to post ~1mo file.

yep i could use another thing that a female specie...forgot all rudeness of pr0nspam of this forum.

i played with pr0show pr0ducer of phot!dex

here

hxxp://[www.photodex.com/files/pspro_30_1904.exe](http://www.photodex.com/files/pspro_30_1904.exe)

its a nice but expensive slideshow maker and more but i've made this small example with a sleeping picture on my hd and tried to understand why is the picture scrambled when ripping it.

cant compare to original as the proggy encode it with their (c) compupic jpg and size is no the same anymore.

well,i dont want to make any troubles if you want to supress above link to avoid honeyspamers but attachements are limited and thought that the bw of this forum could be spared aswell.

regards.
