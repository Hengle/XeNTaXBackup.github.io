- Post Title: Zoids VS .dat request

I've been looking for the character sprites (tachi-e) from the Zoids VS cutscenes, and I think they're inside one of the attached .dat files. Unfortunately, .dat is a frustratingly vague extension, and I couldn't find anything useful via hex editor (then again, I don't know much about this stuff). If anyone can help me get the images out, I'd be really grateful.
