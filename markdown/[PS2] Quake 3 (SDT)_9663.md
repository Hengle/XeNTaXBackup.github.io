- Post Title: [PS2] Quake 3 (*SDT)

With the recent release of Borderlands 2 and its OST, I went back to explore the previous works of their composers - Sonic Mayhem (Cris Velasco & Sascha Dikiciyan). One of them is Quake 3 from back in a day.

PC and Dreamcast gave no problems since PC's *pk3 files are are simple rar containers and DC already had all tracks in WAV format. 
The tracks are different by the way for each version, which makes me wonder if PS2 version also has unique tracks. 

File MUSIC.SDT is fairly small, only 31 mb, which is not good for how the files inside of it were compressed I guess, but anyways would nice to check them out. 

Please PM me for the sample file.

Thank you.

MPEG 2.0 layer inside, use Nova Soft Extractor for extraction.

I should have known to run a scan with Nova, but thought if Cube Media Player haven't found anything, it wouldn't either.
Problem solved, thanks!
