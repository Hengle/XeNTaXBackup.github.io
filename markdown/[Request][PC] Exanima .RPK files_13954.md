- Post Title: [Request][PC] "Exanima" .RPK files

I'm looking for a tool to open/extract the PRK files, for the game Exanima.
Here is a zip file with some samples : [http://www43.zippyshare.com/v/DOc5ys3m/file.html](http://www43.zippyshare.com/v/DOc5ys3m/file.html)

For information, it seems the game is based on an in-house engine.
I had no luck with QuickBMS nor offzip so far...

For those who don't know Exanima, it is a indie physics-based isometric action RPG, in Early Access:
