- Post Title: ninja gaiden sigma 1, about existing tools

[viewtopic.php?f=16&p=35667#p35667](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=16&p=35667#p35667)
so far, I know surveyer already had the sigma model extractor working 3 years ago. the thread is that old so I didn't want to bump it again.

in ninja gaiden sigma, the character models are stored in *.afs files. neosis can extract afs files. so I extracted the afs, and I see 7 files
0000_r, TMC, 4.71 mb
0001_r, ????, 3.40 mb
0002_r, chr_dat, 1.01mb
0003_h, TMC, 474 kb
0004_h, chr_dat, 114 kb
0005_r, chr_dat2, 1.20 kb
0006_r, itm_dat2, 400 bytes

here's the afs file
[http://www75.zippyshare.com/v/93450687/file.html](http://www75.zippyshare.com/v/93450687/file.html)

0000_r is rachel's character model that the extractor can read
0003_h is rachel's hammer model

so what are the rest of the files? and which ones are the texture files? which ones are the bone files?

surveyer also provided a tool for texture extraction, but it only said to work on NG2 and DOAX2, not sigma.

as of now I have the wavefront file of rachel's 3D model, how do I go and obtain the textures for it?

Hello Xentax community!

I hope you don't mind me bumping this older thread. I want to browse through the textures of Ninja Gaiden Sigma (1) and I need some help  .

Now, what i can do is this: I can browse and listen to the audio files with AFS Explorer, but this programm doesn't show anything textures like. If I export the .afs files either with afs explorer or noesis, the extracted files have no file extension and therefor I don't know what the next step has to be. Maybe some of you can help me?

I sincerely hope my question doesn't break xentax's rules.


Thank you in advance for your help.
