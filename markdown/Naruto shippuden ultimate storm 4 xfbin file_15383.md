I tried like this:   .   .

Here is my file:  [https://www.sendspace.com/filegroup/Vax ... MFGJ1S5BUg](https://www.sendspace.com/filegroup/VaxRPz8SVaLfMFGJ1S5BUg) 


I still on training create unpacker script. This time is for xfbin in Naruto 4. 
Help me create script for this? Or maybe just a bit help. What I should do next? what I need to know to understand file structure?

I'm not sure how clearer I can be. The files you provided look to be encrypted. Please refrain from double posting. Thanks.
