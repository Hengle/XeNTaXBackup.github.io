I have a script already and Noesis plugin for textures, though better wait for full game release. So, developers didn't change anything like DICE did. Though, if anyone willing to make the script on their own and share lol no one will stop them xD

Hi. Just a reminder, please remain friendly and do not demand authors of tools release their work if they do not want to. That is at their own discretion.

Cheers.
