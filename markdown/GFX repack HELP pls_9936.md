For which game is this?
It's not like other gfx files.
Gfx is Scaleform graphic files and its some kind of .swf file.
But if you need a repack it means you have already unpacked it.
To make it gfx again I think you're gonna need Scaleform SDk and its tools.
Edit:
On some more examinations its compressed gfx file.
