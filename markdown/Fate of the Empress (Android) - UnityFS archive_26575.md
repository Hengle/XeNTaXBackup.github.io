- Post Title: Fate of the Empress (Android) - UnityFS archive

Hello Forums, I have a very strange file here, opening it up in notepadd ++ shows a UNITYFS header, but this is where it gets weird, if you try to open it with any script or unity viewer like unity asset viewer 16. it will rapidly balloon memory usage over 100 gigs while saying "decompressing". I have no idea why. 
here is the file, it says its a UNITYFS so it should be openable.
I read that it could be compressed with LZMA or LZ4 ? but it doesn't look compressed. 

it has two files and both are over a gig, the main file is 2.2 gig. but it shouldn't take over 100 gig of memory to open should it?

The file is far to big to attach here.

So bit of an update. thanks to DJ normality,
now know a bit more about the file, first it might have a double header. 
however deleting the first header in hex editor does not fix the file and it becomes totally unreadable by UAV

Also thanks to DJ normality, after trying VGM tools to cut the file apart, it produces unopenable files, 
so I'm still really stuck as to what is wrong with those two files making them unreadable by UAV.

I'm being told there is possible encryption in the file? but I can not see where.

If we don't know the title, there is not much you can do. Everyone wants to hide it.

Oh I'm sorry, it's a Android unity game called Fate of the Empress.
