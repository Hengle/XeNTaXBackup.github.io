- Post Title: Are you interested in the chiptune scene? If so, which?

Poll time ! 

You know the game industry has been around since the late 1970s and many games already featured music and sound effects from then on. 
Some classic music has been composed for the various sound chips in those old computers from the past, like the SID chip in the Commodore 64, or the AY chips in the MSX and ZX Spectrum computers. Later sampling was added to the arsenal on the Commodore Amiga and other platforms. 
Game music has always been a thing, but there is a whole scene around composing music for the old soundchips. The chiptune scene. Here's a poll question to understand how our community looks at this.
