this script requires you also have lib_zq_nintendo_tex.py next to it, grab it from here if you don't already:

Wow, it's spreading faster then I thought it would   

Just in case: I'm most likely going to modify its internal structure (and add more features) but as long as readTexture method is all you need (which is the case like always), it shouldn't bother you because I want to keep it backwards compatible.
