- Post Title: Ironsight - Fully working extractor (with latest decryption)

Halo,

First time posting here.
So I've seen some people was trying to unpack Ironsight's archives, but Luigi's BMS script is not working completely as they added an encryption flag.
I've done a C++ extractor complete with decryption and stuff.

Have fun.
