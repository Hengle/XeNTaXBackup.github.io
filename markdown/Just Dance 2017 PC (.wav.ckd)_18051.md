to replace the audio file you need an audio editing software
you'll take your audio file it has to be .wav and render it to sample rate 48000Hz
then with a hex editor software you have to copy everything before the î from the wav.ckd and paste it before the î on your audio file
then rename your audio file extension to .wav.ckd
