- Post Title: Some questions about 3dmodel

Hi to all guys...
(Sorry in advance if this discussion if it is out of place)
I need help on a few things...
hope you can help me...so:
1)There is a way to convert a 3d file .Obj to .gmo?
my intent is put in dissidia (game for psp) a charachter from trinity universe for ps3...i've alredy have the model but is .obj with all textures .tga........so i ask to you if there is ANY way to make it possible...
i've alredy replaced an existing model with another (.gmo)...so i don't have any problem for "import it in the game" 

2)i've always work with photoshop..flash...etc and I've never touched a program for 3d...so i need a suggest for create scenes ... (even non-animated) from which derive mainly of shots (jpg, png) .... just to pose the character....what program do you recommend? and if possible supported by a tutorial (especially the 3d model I have it ready I just use it as a dummy and put it in pose)

Thanks in advance for the answers..(and sorry for my bad english)...however....this forum is great and full of resource :3
