- Post Title: Unbound Saga XBLA *.sound - comp/enc/format?

Hi!

I'm totally lost on the *.sound files from Unbound Saga XBLA. They all start with the identifier C9DF7253, but I've never seen these files.
Here's a link to a screen: [http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/56 ... sound.png/](http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/560/unboundsagaxblasound.png/)
Can anyone identify the format/compression/encryption? Thanks for your help!
PM me for more information.

Huh, nobody any idea? Wouldn't have thought that it would be this difficult to recognize the format.
Or am I in the wrong section? Admin?
