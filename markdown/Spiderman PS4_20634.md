Spiderman 2018 (PS4) tool. Models, textures & maps supported now

First you need to decompress "toc" file from specific version you're using. You can do it with quickbms or offzip.exe
For example: offzip.exe -a toc outputfolder 0
After that, rename decompressed file to "toc" and replace it.

Then correct INI file for the folder where you have game data files
Then run some of these commands:

1. spiderman 99807473A3981A8D - will extract that asset
2. spiderman 99807473A3981A8D c:\spider\iw -  will extract asset into folder with name you specified
3. spiderman list.txt - will extract ALL assets in list

asset lists (all assets, and models only) - [https://www56.zippyshare.com/v/RW9dW1Qw/file.html](https://www56.zippyshare.com/v/RW9dW1Qw/file.html)

you can also edit "list.txt" to give assets any names/folders/drives you want
tool will work based on HASHES (not names), names are given for reference

New version:

- proper bone names
- vertex normals
- map support

maps are .zone files. Not all of them contain models, so some will crash.
Try "ground" and "art" files, having names like 

tile_k22_ground.zone or tile_k22_ground_overlay_act3.zone

Hai Daemon, 

I gave it a try,
I know this tool is in development, but most of these assets don't work for me

the one you posted - 99807473A3981A8D works and it's some sort of torso shield (no textures, just asci )
I picked plenty of files with tags like object, texture, models, I got nothing

Few questions I hope you will answer, 
Does something missing from my working data and do I use correct cmd?

You mentioning some list.txt and ini path?

99807473A3981A8D - not a shield, its a full model of spiderman
textures can be extracted separately if you put their names from materials file to the list for the tool to extract
as you can see in the error message, you also need that p.... file

Anyway thanks for the tool chief, really appreciate it, you gonna fire this forum when you make RDD2 tool,
till then I'm building you an statue over in my backyard  

spoiler alert PS4 extracted assets  




This is a bit off-topic, I'm dying to know, and I looked everywhere, is there's a chance you could try something with NFS 2015 files,
I was surprised there's no single tool for it, and that was pretty awesome game.. ( interested in textures mostly)

This request has Frostbite written all over it and the forum is full of tools/scripts/tutorials and other crap on how to get what you want.
Search function is your best friend, use it and you'll be amazed 
The game was released in March 15, 2016 btw, so you know what to search for in here.

Hey guys,

Howdy - Total n00b here who stumbled on this thread whilst searching for Spidey assets... didn't even know this was a 'thing'!  Awesome work

Just wondering if anyone could shed some light on how/where I can pull or download art assets for this game for some personal animation work? Are there any tutorials for this stuff anywhere? I'm assuming I've got to rip my PS4 game disc to PC and then run some kind of extraction program somewhere? 

Any help would be much appreciated...

Excelsior!

As you've noticed, the tool in the very first post is the one that will extract/convert assets from the game, currently supported are skeletal meshes/characters and map assets.
Unfortunately you can NOT dump your own copy of the game since there is no public PS4 kernel exploit for a higher firmware.

Just double checking, does anyone here have access to dumped games files that they would be willing to PM? I just want the files for Spider-Man and the alternate costumes so I can port them to SFM and XNA. Some have been released, but there's still quite a few that haven't been posted yet. Thanks.

There is no asset list with the hashes / names, the tool doesn't generate anything and therefore cannot extract anything from the game files. The game files has already been dumped and released publicly because of new PS4 exploit, please just release the required text file and other missing files for everyone else. Thank you.

Finally got the game extracted, but whenever I try to use the tool, no matter what model I try to extract I keep getting an unhandled exception about the given key not being present in the dictionary. Does this tool only work with a specific version of the game, or am I missing something?

Probably you need to decompress "toc" file from specific version you're using.
You can do it with quickbms or offzip.exe

For example:

offzip.exe -a toc outputfolder 0

After that, rename decompressed file to "toc" and replace it.

I believe you just decompress the "DAG" file which contain file names...

Hi, my friend~~
I'm try to extract game files from version 1.05, and I used the "allassets.txt" file which you provide.
After progress, I got a lot of files which are only 1kb size and I also got a materials.txt.
The problem is these files seems are not correct, and I got a warning message: not being present in the dictionary when I use "list.txt".
Do you know why I can not extract right files? 
Thanks~~

I've succeeded to extract .zone file from game, but there's no materials.txt file, so werid.
I want to restore the textures of these models in blender, where I can find these materials? Thanks.

Oh, and one more thing, I found the size of some ascii files are very big, more than 600MB. Can we slice it into small one, so we can import them much easier?

Can I donate to you? your tools helps me a lot.

Have you considered looking into the game's animation format? Spider-Man PS4 has some of the most fluid I've ever seen in a game, and would make the first Spider-Man title *ever* to have it's animations successfully converted.


Thanks,

Alright, so I found a way to extract the filesystem from Ratchet and Clank; set up the tool with the ini and decompressed toc, the pkg contained what looks to be a complete list of hashes detailing the locations of every asset in the game. Only problem is that when I point to said hash, Spiderman tool tells me it can't find the asset. Either the document is incorrect or the tool isn't quite compatible with the game yet.

It's worth noting that the asset archive is split between several binary files; they range from g00s00 to g13s00. Not sure if Spiderman works like that too, don't have the pkg for that game. I'll link the excel spreadsheets so ya'll can take a look.

Ratchet and Clank models were made with older, very different engine version. No way it can work with spiderman tool.

What model hashes are you looking for exactly? No new models were added in 1.17, the latest models to be added were the Upgraded and Stealth suit, and I think they're already present in the models.txt file. Have you checked?

Yeah, I see that now. I thought it would include 1.16 since I saw future foundation and bagman suits. Unfortunately, I can't help you with the hashes, someone with more knowledge than me could.

Hi，deamon1，first of all ,thanks for your great tool.
But I ran to some error when I extracted the models.
After I use      spiderman allassets.txt, it showed "asset not found:XXXXXXXXXXXX"

And      spiderman models.txt, it showed "could not find the file g02s000", but there is only g00s000 ~ g00s018 in my asset_archive floder.

Could you tell me which part I did wrong? Thanks.

Its bad idea to use allassets.txt, because only models and textures are supported by the tool, and this list only included for reference and research.

If you get "could not find the file g02s000", it means your TOC file has references to it, and this file must be present in your folders.

Nothing is impossible as daemon might say, whats almost impossible yet still possible, is to find right person skilled enough to do it, but currently no one has tampered with this, besides reversing the models as you can see by daemon, consoles are NOT easy to mod compared to PC.

so, is anyone able to help to find the models hashes from the 1.17 update ?


I created a list for 1.17, and there are only 3 changes:

REMOVED 1 model:
88F27B2DD11D2433	characters\hero\hero_spiderman_spidercop\hero_spiderman_spidercop.model	

added 2 models:
A5753561B8834043	characters\hero\hero_spiderman_ffh\hero_spiderman_ffh.model
A94A3D85E0086FBE	characters\hero\hero_spiderman_ffh_stealth\hero_spiderman_ffh_stealth.model

That's really weird i searched all the file and even the game path of the toc file and for exemple there was an art model that was missing stan lee for exemple it was labeled characters\npc\npc_stanlee\npc_stanlee_art.model 
But is not present in the Allmodels list or the All Assets file
so idk i figured you either skipped it or just didn't bother

Most art models are just leftovers, they are not present in game

i had some problems working with maps an was a bit sad that no materials files was included with the maps (which means harder setup) so i just give up for a bit but this update even tho it has no major change motivated me to try again
(btw i found stan lee after researching every civilains it works perfectly ! )

Hi.  Thank you for the tools.  I was able to extract the models and textures successfully and am using Blender to assemble them.  I did have a couple of questions.  I know the C map is color/diffuse, and N is normal, but what is G used for?  Also, I noticed that the hand maps have alphas on the fingernails.  Are the nails on a separate map, or is there a method to assemble them?

G is often use for multiples maps, like roughness, metallic, and specular you just gotta separate them with a separate rgb node each value is stored in one color

Thank you for the clarification.  As for the fingernails, I'll most likely be editing them in with Gimp or Krita.  But I am still curious how they would have worked originally.

the link for the list of assets is down once more, this is the error that I get when i attempt to reach the zippyshare link, could you please upload it once more?

i never updated the link before, that is the first original link, and it is STILL WORKING

Oh I see, I must have misunderstood it, my apologies. Thing is I have tried the link in 3 different computers and a phone and they all show me the same error when using this link:

Danm...is there a way to generate the list of assets with the files that you have provided? I tested it with the asset code that you put as an example and it works perfectly! your process is the best, or maybe if you could send me the lists as a private message? its the only thing stopping me from doing the process, please

The list you have to modify

I put it as :

spiderman.exe [hash] 

I dont have the list anymore since its easy to make. Use googledoc sheets to add the column for "spiderman.exe" just download as comma separated .csv
Then for the 1st comma CTRL+R for replace the "," with "spiderman.exe" with a space so "spiderman.exe ".
Then you can just run the tool from CMD do CTRL+A and CTRL+C all the info in the new list. and CTRL+V into the CMD and process all the models at once. That's the best way to use daemons tools.

Hi! thank you for the help. I have downloaded from googledocs an empty sheet as comma separated .csv and named it TEST I´m unsure what to do next, should I open the file in google sheets, excel or something to do the CTRL+R step? I tried to do so In these programs but given that they are empty i dont know what "," its going to replace for "spiderman.exe ¨ help pleaseeeeeee!!!!!

Hi, first of all, thank you so much to daemon1 for putting out this tool! I've been wanting to try out this sort of thing for a while but never knew how to extract the models. Now I do (to a degree), and that's due in large part to finding this post.

EDIT: Figured it out, removing questions to reduce post length.

yes. a list of textures will be extracted, and you can retrieve them all by running that list through the tool again

Here is an example with tile_p36_ground.zone extraction. I've extracted 700+ of these with no crash, the tool is working amazingly well. 

I just don't understand what I'm doing wrong to miss the textures

ah, i just checked my code
yes, i WAS planning materials for maps, but it was never finished because nobody was interested
so no, you can't currently get textures for maps

Just a simple question that would eventually save a bunch of time: when importing a model.ascii on Blender, all the meshes are named sm_1, sm_2, sm_3, etc. Would it be possible to get the model names on these meshes?

I'm working on zones and finding correct objects is a pain.

Thanks,
Gabz

i'm not sure what you mean when you say "finding correct objects".
there's no such a thing as model names in this game.

I am looking for a way to find each objects included in a zone to be able to texture them. For single object it's easier since you get a material.txt for a single mesh, but for a zone - even if we had a material.txt - it's almost impossible to know which texture goes where.

Is there any workaround? I am willing to spend time and efforts on this, but I'm just lost on how to make it easier.

You can't "find" scene objects as single objects, they only exist inside of a zone.
And there are 10.000 of objects in a typical map, spiderman does maps splitting them into really small parts.

Right now i'm busy with maps for 2 other games, so i have no time for anything else.

Hi, I was just hoping to get some input as I'm struggling with exporting the characters' hair textures. I downloaded a version of the model that someone else had done to compare, as shown in the images below (my export on the left, download on the right). It seems clear to me that the reason the hair is turning out so bad is because the texture I'm using doesn't have a transparent background (alpha map? I feel like that's the term I've seen used), but what I'm unsure of is how to fix it. 

Is there an additional texture I need to export, or is there a method for cutting away the background? There's an additional texture with a black background where the hairs are all white (specular/ambient occlusion, I think?) which I tried messing around with to get it looking like the transparent hair texture on the right, but it didn't turn out very well so I feel like I must be missing something.

  stupid mistake, didn't downloaded patches and dlc's..

Anyway thanks for the tool chief, really appreciate it, you gonna fire this forum when you make RDD2 tool,
till then I'm building you an statue over in my backyard  

spoiler alert PS4 extracted assets  




This is a bit off-topic, I'm dying to know, and I looked everywhere, is there's a chance you could try something with NFS 2015 files,
I was surprised there's no single tool for it, and that was pretty awesome game.. ( interested in textures mostly)

Yoo would you mind sending me those assets? Totally okay if not :DD

Well it is decently easy to fool around but a PC version would bring so much more ease to the process but I did in fact port Dr. Octopus and set up special rigs for the Tentacles to use with but I didn't play with the other villains at all.

There are so many PS4 PKG dumps out there is not even funny, and I'm not even trying to be funny, google, torrents, websites dedicated for it, etc. All you have to do is just... search, i just did a search for the game name and what platform is from and lots of websites pop up ready for you to get what you look for, no one is goign to post linsk for you in here, that's a big no, no.

You do not require any special skills, you can do it too, you do NOT need a PS4 either (unless your a hacker then its another story), those who dump the PKGs are making them as FakePKGs so anyone can extract/convert them easily form an already hacked/exploited PS4.

Spiderman 2018 (PS4) tool. Models, textures & maps supported now

First you need to decompress "toc" file from specific version you're using. You can do it with quickbms or offzip.exe
For example: offzip.exe -a toc outputfolder 0
After that, rename decompressed file to "toc" and replace it.

Then correct INI file for the folder where you have game data files
Then run some of these commands:

1. spiderman 99807473A3981A8D - will extract that asset
2. spiderman 99807473A3981A8D c:\spider\iw -  will extract asset into folder with name you specified
3. spiderman list.txt - will extract ALL assets in list

asset lists (all assets, and models only) - https://www56.zippyshare.com/v/RW9dW1Qw/file.html

you can also edit "list.txt" to give assets any names/folders/drives you want
tool will work based on HASHES (not names), names are given for reference

Just because a custom tool, such as this to convert game models has no digital signature validated by Microsoft, it does NOT mean it is a virus, just because the tool has code to protect it from other users to de-compile it, it does NOT mean its a virus, if you really think that, you shouldn't even be online at all, yet alone make such posts, my humble opinion.

I just saying that it came up as a warning and won't let me download, not saying it's not trustworthy since a lot of people have used it.

Hi, I'm late to the game, but I recently downloaded The ASM suit and put it together in Maya. I recreated the hexagon patterns in substance designer for higher detail.
This is how it looks


I'm wondering if anyone have extraced buildings from this game?
Otherwise I'm looking into doing that if possible.

EDIT: Oops, accidentally posted a link to a model offsite, not sure if that was legal so deleted.

I don't really know where to start to rip environments from this game. I started looking into it, but I don't think I have time to put myself into it all.
But I really appreciate the effort you made, @daemon1 with your software for this to be possible.

i dont think you can find decrypted PKG for this game
as i said before, files are distributed between people
as it always was with exclusive games i made tools for

I know you say that the files are distributed between people exclusively, would it be possible for me to get my hands on them from someone? I would like to try this tool out to get some specific models but as of now it does not seem possible for me.

That was a very long time ago when files where not public, as it goes for every new game that PS4 hackers have no public release of the exploit, the game has been long available online in so many forums/websites/trackers, all you have to do is google it and you'll get them just fine. key words like FakePKG along side the game title is one of them.

Hey everyone so the file system seems to be the same on the pc version so here's the toc and dag of the pc version if that helps

Got it thanks! I ended up purchasing the PC release (never played the game). As others have mentioned, the filesystem seems to be the same as the PS4 release. So to use the tool, I place spiderman.exe and spider.ini into the directory (modify the ini to be the same assets_archive folder), and use CMD to execute commands to extract models? The initial post with the tool dl was a little unclear to me lol

Daemon, any idea on if you'll make a tool/list compatible with the new PC release? Love the tools btw

yes, possibly. But lets wait until we see the files.

Tried with both PC and decrypted dag/toc files, the tool doesn't give any output (had to run it as administrator, otherwise i'd get an exception).

Hi,Daemon1 wrote on his Discord server:
PC version its different, even archive format.
So not now, i will delay it for later.
So you need to wait until he has time for it.
