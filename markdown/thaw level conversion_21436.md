- Post Title: thaw level conversion

So i been looking into the tony hawks american wasteland pak.wpc. I will attatch an example file to work with. I learned to open up the file in queenbee and see there are alot of files in them, there is a .col which is half the work right there. I have a plug in for blender to import scn.xbx and col.xbx. in order to get that .col into col.xbx, i simply remove 2 lines in hex editor and change the file extension to col.xbx. now im searching for a .scn file. Ill also share an example of a .scn.xbx file which is what I need. I'm not good at coding and i cant seemto find any tools. I'd apreciate the help!

These are the lines you remove from the .col to make it into a col.xbx
