- Post Title: VB File Format for PS2

I need to know of a good program that can open a VB file format. I've heard that MFAudio can do it, but I've had no luck with that program. Then I tried PSound, which worked for the most part, but cuts off the music right before the end. Does anyone know anything about this?

vgmtoolbox -> GENH -> PlayStation 4-bit ADPCM (or not in this format, depends on the specific game). You should post game name and upload samples files.

If you PM me a sample file I can probably help. (I'm good with PS2 ADPCM files.)

I'm still struggling with this. Is there any program that can play it and find the exact loop point???
