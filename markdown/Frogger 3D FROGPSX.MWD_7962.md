in my opinion this is a data only file.
I guess there is an index file somewhere but the files contained in this archive are "PP20" which is probably a graphic format that I don't know

Are those the only files in it? You would think there would be a lot more, considering the only other things in the installation folder are the exe, uninstall, "delete save data", a readme, a setup.ini and a few internet shortcuts. (also that of course)

Edit: Did you use a quickbms code or something to open it?

I used a hex editor (xvi32) to check the archive.

Is there any way to extract them? (Sorry if this is a n00bish question, I don't know much about this sort of thing.)
