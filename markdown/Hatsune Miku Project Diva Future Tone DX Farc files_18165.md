I've made an extractor for the new .farc files which is also compatible with the older iterations. You can find it in my repository:

EDIT: Updated with the latest version of the program.

Should work with any kind of FARC, including Future Tone.

Usage is explained in the program.

Thanks.

Hi:
I was going to ask you something. I saw the program that you created a long time ago but I don't understand how it opens and is used to extract the files from the game, especially I am interested in models and motions. If you could tell me how your program opens I would appreciate it.
