- Post Title: Monster Hunter Generations Ultimate Models?

Hi all
I've been wanting to get the models from Monster Hunter Generations Ultimate for ages now but no matter what I try, I cannot for the life of me open the .MOD files where the monsters are stored. I'd also love a better method for converting the .Tex files for the Textures as RawTex is proving to be way too slow.

Has any progress been made with this game? I'd really like to get my hands on the models. Also, please don't bring up 3DS Max in the replies, I ain't get that kind of money! Ha! Ha!

I'm afraid that at the moment, 3DSMax is the only option for getting the models from the game. I've been somewhat working on a fork of the Blender importer for MHW to work on these files, but progress is slow since there's a lot of other stuff I want to work on. That being said, Kukkii from the Kuriimu suite can open the .tex files and export them to png (though dds or tga might be a better option since you'll need to separate the alpha channel from it).

Funny enough; I actually learned about Kukrii not long after I posted this thread but thanks for the reply nonetheless.
I really would love to be able to get these models but if it's currently not possible then nothing we can do about it.
