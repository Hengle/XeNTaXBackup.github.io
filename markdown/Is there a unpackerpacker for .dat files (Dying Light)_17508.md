- Post Title: Is there a unpacker/packer for .dat files? (Dying Light)

I've extracted a .rpack file (of Dying Light) via quickbms but all I've got in the end was a couple of .dat files. I'm seeking the textures that contains font files and aim to modify and repack them. Any ideas? Does the .dat file of this game require a specific tool written only for itself or there is a common tool that extracts all types of .dat?

Nope. The only thing that can determine a file type is its signature/magic number.
Still, you could try your luck with Noesis.
