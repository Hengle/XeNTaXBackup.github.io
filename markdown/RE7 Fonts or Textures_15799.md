- Post Title: RE7 Fonts or Textures

Anyone found the font files pls ? I have try to extract all dds and i did but i was not able to identify the font file except this oft files in IU folder, but data from that files does not mean anything for me. Can anyone pls have a look, at least tell me what format is that? We figured out the new message format, it also mess and a complete a new structure..  Im working on the tool to mod the game but without possibility to do localization i will leave it, coz we need only loc the game at this moment. Only obstacle is damn stupid fonts.. I dont think that font is in tex file...
