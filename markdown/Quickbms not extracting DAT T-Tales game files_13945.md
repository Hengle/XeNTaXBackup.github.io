I'm trying to extract the Chronicles of Narnia games by Traveller's Tale. I learned about quickbms from this site, and tried it out, but I think I'm choosing the wrong file to extract.

I've got ttbms file, I'm okay following the prompts and selecting the folders, but If I use * to scan the extract folder, it grinds my computer to a halt, and returns some kind of error.

Any help or insight is appreciated.
