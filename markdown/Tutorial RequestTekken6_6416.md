Hello i am wondering if anyone could teach me how to do this,i have already extracted the models and textures
i exported the models in the format of smd and psk for use in a different game,the problems i am having is
how to re assemble the models and how to properly re apply their textures since 3dsmax2011 dumps the textures upon importing the files.
here is a few screenshots to show you where im at.
