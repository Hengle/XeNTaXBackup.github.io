Here are some sites of interest:

Tim Tool (to extract/import/convert TIM2 files)
[http://sourceforge.net/forum/forum.php?forum_id=273980](http://sourceforge.net/forum/forum.php?forum_id=273980)

xnView (can apparently view TIM2 files)
[http://perso.orange.fr/pierre.g/xnview/endownload.html](http://perso.orange.fr/pierre.g/xnview/endownload.html)

Tutorial on TIM2 and TIM3 extraction/conversion
[http://home.comcast.net/~radical-dreamer/tutorials.htm](http://home.comcast.net/~radical-dreamer/tutorials.htm)

Perhaps via getting into touch with Radical Dreamer you can get that Photoshop plugin, as he links to that guy Silverado who disappeared.

You can directly edit tm2 files with optipix.

Agreeing with the rest, can someone give a link to Tim Tools? (when you look it up, well, you just get other things that just edit, and Tim Taylor...)

anyways, if someone has a copy they're willing to upload, thank you. ^_^

Give [TimView Plus](http://www.romhacking.net/utils/799/) a try for ripping.

Nope doesn't work, for 2 possible reason,
1. the most likely, that searches for TIM, not TIM2.
2. The tim2 is encrypted.

try game graphic studio... you can open and edit...

if you want... save the image as png... after use OPTPIX to convert to tim2 again...

If you want give me the images... i convert to png to you edit and you give me to convert to TIM2 again...

Search leaked PSP SDK. It has format description and converters. Having library headers/signatures will also help you disassembling PSP exes.

After a whole week of research, I found them:

[Textures Extractor/Reinserter](http://www.mediafire.com/download.php?w155ami3q73b301)

[Tim Tool](http://www.mediafire.com/download.php?xb65h58lmk35gky)

-First, look for tm2 images in your PS2 .iso, using TextER.
-Then, convert those images to .bmp in order to edit them, using Tim Tool.

Cya.

I'd still like to see the tutorial on Tim2/3 conversion. If someone have anything about it.
