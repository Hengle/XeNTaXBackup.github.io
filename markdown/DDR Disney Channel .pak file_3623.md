- Post Title: DDR Disney Channel *.pak file

I use ISObuster and extracted what seems to be the only file containing all the game data.

Here is the rundown of the file info:

Filename: data.pak
size: 3.69GB

I tried to use the scan mode in MultiEX but it crashed eveytime when I proceed with the scan...

How do I shrink the file or only post bits of the file for analyze?

[viewtopic.php?f=28&t=1270](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=28&t=1270) Read the rules. There's a link to the FIleCutter tool to post only bits of the file.

I tried to cut the file with the filecutter but after I select the file to cut and the file name to save and press the button. I got two empty dialogs and nothing created in my system... I am not sure what I have done wrong here...

Perhaps the Cutter failed. Try this one:

Hi Mr. Mouse,

The program you attached works. I am attaching the output file now...

I cut the data file with the default settings.

I managed to cut the beginning 10MB of the file. However, I tried various way to cut out the last 10MB but nothing came out.. I also try to find out the byte size of my file then substract 10MB from it, but doesn't work when I input the numeric data into the program...

use HxD and just highlight the end of the file and hit copy then create a new file hit paste and save it.
just go further back until you have around 10 mb in the new file.
