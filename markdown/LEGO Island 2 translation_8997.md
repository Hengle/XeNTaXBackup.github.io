- Post Title: LEGO Island 2 translation

Hi everyone!

At the moment I'm translating a game called LEGO Island 2. But I have a problem with it.
I found out, that the game's texts are in the messages.bob file.

For example, there's a line like this:
FILEFRECR00:-1 Credits

If I replace it with this:
FILEFRECR00:-1 ST√ÅBLISTA

This is what I can see in the game:
FRECR00

So sometimes it doesn't show the translated text correctly, only its ID.

[http://pastebin.com/4hwkQ8xB](http://pastebin.com/4hwkQ8xB) < here is the messages.bob file.
I have already translated some of the lines into Hungarian.

Try looking at the messages.bod file. It looks like some sort of index file, now possibly pointing to the wrong offsets because of your changed lines.

Thanks for your help! I could extract the file, but I can't compile it unfortunately.

Did you try Quickbms reimport function?
