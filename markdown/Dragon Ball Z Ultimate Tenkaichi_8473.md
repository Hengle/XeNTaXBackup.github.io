- Post Title: Dragon Ball Z: Ultimate Tenkaichi

This is my first post here, but I'm writing to find out if anyone knows if Dragon Ball Z: Ultimate Tenkaichi's models can be gotten to by any means at all? I have heard that XDVDMulleter can read through most XBOX 360 game disc. I'm just wondering if anyone know the formats with which the game's models were saved as?
