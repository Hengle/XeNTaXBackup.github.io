Hello, friends. I wanted to translate this great game for my language, but unfortunately I did not find tool compatible with Xbox 360. Does anyone know any tool to direct me to extract the information with .vpp_xbox2?

I'm sorry if I wrote something wrong. I'm using Google Translator.

Thanks.

translation is extremely complicated on this game, reason is that dialog s are split in to 10000 files...

Actually there is already a translation, I would just adapt it to the Xbox 360.
