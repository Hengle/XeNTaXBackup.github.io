- Post Title: Repack Frostbite 3 files

Frostbite 3 games such as Battlefield 4

Hi

I use [this script](http://www.bfeditor.org/forums/index.php?showtopic=15731&st=0) for dump Battlefield files.

But after unpacking them, I don't know how can repack them!

Or is there any way to change directly a texture in files?

There is nothing that can repack them in presently as even unpacking is rather complicated process and expecting repacker for engine as complicated as frostbite is probably years of wait if ever unless you steal core raw files and compiler from the developer offices and wait several hours to repack 

Changing a texture directly is also a no go as textures are held as raw data without dds header and even so archive is compressed so inserting them back in is no small feat not to mention complexity of archive design.
