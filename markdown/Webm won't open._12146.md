- Post Title: Webm won't open.

Hello! 
I'm working on a Skill Simulator for the game Black Desert Online. The in-game skilltree has video previews for each active skill. I found the files (webm) but they won't play on any player (even VLC) or browser (IE, Firefox, Opera...). Some pngs and jpgs are not opening too. It's some kind of protection, isn't it?

I'm sorry for the silly question, but...Is there any way for having this to work? Or I'll have to record each video individually? D:

I compressed 3 samples below:

Those files aren't real. They consist of one byte of 0x01 and the rest is filled with zeros. Notice how your .rar file compresses to 855 bytes? No actual video file will compress to that small.

I see...But it looks like someone called "Formica" managed to get these files working at:  [http://form1ca.ru/media/bdo/calc/calc_01war.html](http://form1ca.ru/media/bdo/calc/calc_01war.html) ...Any ideas? D: (just mouseover the skill boxes)
Checking the website's preview videos "get" folder, it's the exact as the game's folder.

Well, the files you uploaded were empty. Maybe try obtaining them again?
