The detected format I got when scanning the file is WAVs, basically battle sound effects perhaps the boss uses. Perhaps it uses it's own graphic format, or perhaps this does not contain graphical data. I'm not sure, it's one or the other, I'd wait for an expert opinion though XD. But the WAVs are what I found.

Ok, I've looked into some of the DATs and I've come to your conclusion, it is DEFFINETLY a Capcom format.

So far I've learned:

Sound Effects: WAV
Music: MP3 (I could only get them with Dragon Unpacker)

Graphics/Textures must use a custom format. Or I'm missing somthing...

I see, then can we do something about the graphic?

How about your request about Bof PS version?

It may just take a while. Things have been a tad slow recently.

Wanted to translate this game, PC version...
Is there a tool to unpack/repack .DAT format?
