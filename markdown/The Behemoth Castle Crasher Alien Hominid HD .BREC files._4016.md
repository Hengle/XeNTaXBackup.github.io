- Post Title: "The Behemoth" Castle Crasher/ Alien Hominid HD .BREC files.

Hello folks, I have an urgent matter. I desperately need these archives unpacked but have searched relentlessly and have had no luck finding a method of doing so. It seems these types of files are used in all Behemoth games, such as Alien Hominid as well. I hope to have a real breakthrough with these files and hoepfully, for my comic purposes, I'll be able to utilize them properly. In the following download link I've supplied, youw ill find a .PAK file. To extract the internal file all you need do is rename the file to a .zip file. This will produce a folder containing a .BREC file. This file is the final step towards successfully extracting the internal files and opening them up for proper viewing and possibly editing.

Below is an example of the files.

This happens to be the most important file to me, and hopefully we can work together to extract it. If this is done properly I may reward the one who manages to do it in a way that will be determined between me and the one who managed it through PM, if it is wished so. The contents of these files are very important to me and I am desperate at this point, so the matter is urgent.

If you remove first 128 bytes form EWIZARD.COK6.BREC you'll get a swf file. Delete 128 bytes of header, change extension to swf and you'll be able to it in Flash Player (or in web browser).

Wow, you work fast. That's amazing! Thank you so much.

Out of curiosity though, what's the best program to delete the header with?

Try a [hex editor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hex_editor).

Well that worked out well, but it turns out there are other methods of packing within the other files, three others to be precise, one of which has already been taken care of.
The following files I believe to contain more graphic information and the files I need to complete this whole ordeal.

And

If someone could unfurl these for me, the project will be complete. Thank you for all your help thus far!

Hi, you can extract Castle Crashers 2.7 source SWFs from .NREC files using [QuickBMS](https://aluigi.altervista.org/quickbms.htm) with the Castle Defenders script (link under My Scripts on QuickBMS page). [Here's a link](https://www.dropbox.com/s/uiwcdy5xlp29i8r/Castle%20Crashers%20SWF.zip?dl=0) to the extracted SWFs from the game and level directories. Just extract the zip and open the SWFs with a Flash decompiler such as [JPEXS Free Flash Decompiler](https://github.com/jindrapetrik/jpexs-decompiler) and you will be able to view and export all contents of the SWFs in both vector and raster formats.

lol bringing this back another two years later.

Is there any way to reimport modded SWF files? I want to make texture edits.

Hello all Castle Crasher / Behemoth fans!!! I have been wanting to learn more about the way Castle Crashers works because I am so fond of the beautiful game. Has any other progress been made? I would love to somehow help if possible even with my beginner level coding "skills". I know people have been trying to crack this game open like an Easter egg that has been forever sealed but if we work together we can do it!!!
