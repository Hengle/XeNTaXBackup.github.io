Hello,

I am trying to decompress/extract files from the .cab/.hdr files for an EA Sports game called Rugby 2004. I'm wanting to extract the stadium graphic/model files in particular to convert them to another EA game: FIFA14. I've tried universal extractor; powerarchiver; Installshield's own CAB viewer; winpack300b; i6comp and i3comp and still nothing. 
InstallShield CAB Viewer gives me Error number 130 and winpack300b gives me Error: fExtGR5

Can anyone here suggest any other tools which might get the .cab/.hdr to open?
