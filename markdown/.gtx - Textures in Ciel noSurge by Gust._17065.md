It seems that the textures in this game are made with a so called "CRI GT2" PC middleware that was modified to work on the Vita: [http://www.cri-mw.co.jp/product/intervi ... index.html](http://www.cri-mw.co.jp/product/interview/2012/ciel/index.html)

The most I could get out of them is something as swizzled as this:



when it was supposed to look like this:



Here's is an example file, that same texture: [https://my.mixtape.moe/lsscpp.gtx](https://my.mixtape.moe/lsscpp.gtx)

All the Vita related tools I tried failed to work with these files, so I hope someone here will be able to deal with them. Thank you very much in advance.

Oh my god... I've never expected anyone to actually unswizzle this ever. Could you share us your methods?

Thank you very much.
