- Post Title: .sfd Video Files, Softdec video

Original topic:

[viewtopic.php?f=22&t=705&start=15](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=22&t=705&start=15)

Read that page since I said all I know about it there and for more details by Mr.Mouse, here are the links for the sample sfd files:

[http://rapidshare.de/files/39905125/SFD.rar.html](http://rapidshare.de/files/39905125/SFD.rar.html)

Basically, the sfd files were made by Sofdec to carry .mpg/.m2v files along with their .adx/.wav audio.
They are used in some games, most of them for the dreamcast I guess but games like Persona 3 still use them.
What I'm looking for isn't a decoded, there's a plethora of ways to handle them, what I want is a way to MAKE one (an encoder in other words), if anyone can help I'd appreciate it. You'd have to multiplex a .m2v or plain .mpg video with .adx or .wav audio to make one, they're kinda like .pss files but not exactly like them.

Yes, so that SFD files start off with some header, and at some point there's a .m2v file, but with a difference. 

At 0x7e0 intervals there's a line of approx. 0x1f bytes with info that is missing from the actual .m2v file. This info may refer to sound data later in the file, but I'm not sure. 

The SFD files are padded with blocks of 2048 (0x800) bytes for easy reading.

The SFD files should have a video file in .m2v format and audio in .adx format. 

The question is, what's the format of the SFD files and how can we convert .m2v and .adx back into .SFD. 

This is my brief info for now.

ok, this could be useful...but I can't be sure its true so you may just be wasting your time...
see, .sfd files can be made by combining mpeg with audio, but at the time of the DC I have reason to believe the people then used MPEG-1, so the Sega DC Movie Creator should have something to do with MPEG 1 too, naturally, but this isn't what I said could be useful, as you may know, to create a MPEG-1 system (excluding conversion) you must combine MPEG audio and video, .mp2 (back then) and .m1v alike, now for the fun part, I've found out that to create a .sfd file (again exluding conversion) you have to convert the MPEG audio to .sfa audio, and then combine it with the video, .sfd is the video so you just add the audio on it, I guess...also, sfd stands for softdecdata

since I'm really interested in this one there will be more to come, I'm sure of it

hi 
you can use cube media 2 for decode sfd files and use dc movie maker for encode mpg to sfd
or 
use package software "SFD Tool Pack v1.0 by SWAT"

thanks, i actually had found a russian site to download it but it
A) had no english so I was forced to translate it with google
B) wanted registering

but this thing seems kinda fishy though...it says it includes dc movie creator so isn't it kinda...illegal?
still, I'm not complaining...

okay, I installed the stuff and directshow but it doesn't work anyway no matter what compatibility mode I run it on (I've got XP SP2 btw)
but you know what? it doesn't matter, I opened the executable with a hex editor and looked under Ssection Headers
guess what I found under .data...a referance to a file called sfdmux.dll
I did a quick search and I found it in the system32 folder (where else?)
I'll upload it so please, can someone make a tool to encode (or "mux") sfd files?
if there are additional files let me know and I'll find them, MWAHAHAHAHA

For your information: I installed it fine by setting the compatibility mode of the setup.exe to Windows 95 (and I skipped the directshow install). I encoded/converted a AVi file to SFD easily with the tool. 

But yes, I had not opened the package and did not realise that the SDK MC was in there. That is in principle illegal (so I have deinstalled it). Because there are propably some home made tools by SWAT there, I will not remove the link immediately, but be warned that any of those tools that they have which have copyrights belonging to someone else should not be downloaded or used without approval from the copyright holder! Xentax will not be responsible for any illegal activities for any of its visitors/users.

yeah I guess I'll de-install it too...it doesn't work for me anyway
whenever I click a button it just closes so it's a waste of time
any chance for the sfdmux dll thing to be put into use?

> any chance for the sfdmux dll thing to be put into use?Yes. I had a look at it and it is just a DLL wrapper around a command line program (it usually doesn't work like this, so we're lucky). Unfortunately it doesn't print any output to the screen by default, so I had to patch the DLL to get it to display. Making a program from this is very simple. I have already started it.

Here are the functions exported by the DLL:

```
const char* SFM_GetVerStr();
unsigned short SFM_GetVersion();
void SFM_SetProgFunc(long (__stdcall *ProgressCallback)(void* UserData, void* Pointer), void* UserData);
```

In case anyone is curious, this is the usage info from the DLL:

```
Sofdec Multiplexer 1999-05-20
Copyright (c) 1998,1999 CRI

Usage:
   SFDMUX [-LANG={J|E}] -V=video -A=audio -S=output
Option:
   -LANG : change language (E = English, J = Japanese)
   -V    : input VIDEO filename (default extention : M1V)
   -A    : input AUDIO filename (default extention : SFA)
   -S    : output filename      (default extention : SFD)
   -SUB  : use sub-command-file
Sample:
   Ex1) C:\>SFDMUX -V=opening.m1v -A=opening.sfa -S=opening.sfd
   Ex2) C:\>SFDMUX -V=opening -A=opening -S=opening
   Ex3) C:\>SFDMUX -SUB=batch.sub
```

This works fine, by the looks of it. I did not have an actual ADX file to test it out on. And the program requires AFS audio files. But converting a .m2v file to sfd without audio worked.

omg thank you so much!!
I've not really tried the output file because my ps2 is in for maintenance (F'ed up laser)
I tried .adx and .wav audio but this only works with .sfa files huh...
well I believe I had some little program the could convert to .sfa but I'm not really sure...
whatever I'm not asking you to support more formats you've already done more than enough 
I can manage on my own from now on, thank you
I'll post when I test it, it seems mortal kombat armageddon uses .sfd video too so I'll have a lot to do  

edit:
btw it's not softdec its sofdec, lol, my bad...

well unlike M$ (boohoo) sony actually has a greek support service so unlike the xbox "suck60" it'll be here in...say...tuesday (if i were to send my 360 it would come back a month later and there's no xbox live for greece cause M$ is the company pesonification of scrooge mc'duck, however that is spelled, and they won't buy a freakin' server for about 20k euros...)

edit:
there is a petition going on by us for xbox live availability in greece so if you want to sign, go ahead...

actually there is a way for us to join but it invlolves identity theft...lol

sorry you had to wait for so long but i had to leave for my grandpa's house
well for some reason the game ends up 6 gb so i wonder if someone can tell me of any tool to open images that can write and delete stuff from images, has to be free though...even hough the images are .cvm, I believe they are simple format ones that are just renamed since both isobuster and magiciso's free versions can open them...

I tried it with another game that uses sfd video though, mana khemia, I exchanged the opening with project zero 3's first ending...well...the conversion and all worked just fine but when I actually started the game the game just froze when it was time to play the opening

I guess I'll have to try with more games but I don't have any other with sfd videos right now

Are there any filters that would help playing these files in Media Player Classic with sound?  I don't care about demultplexing streams etc, just watching movies pulled off game discs.

This tool worked beautifully for me thank you very much. the game I was trying to get the videos is actually on the PS2 and not the XBOX but the program worked beautifully. I saw music videos in this game when I played it now to just dig them out. I will eventually do every .SFD file on that game. now if there was only a way to make the mpegs so they arn't 512X512 and something more common but this program is exactly what 
i needed, thanks again.

SEGA Dreamcast Movie Creator, works on windows XP.

I have here win xp sp3 and i cant install this program, but i only need enable compatibility mode and select to run like windows 98, and program install and it,after you need enable compatibility in exectuble too.

This run fine.



And video+audio converted with this program to create final sfd file are good.

I try change video in ps2 game and works.
