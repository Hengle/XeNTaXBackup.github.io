hey,
the thread is a little bit old, i know, but i would open this modells too.
So first of all thanks for this import script, but i have a little trouble with importing the dds files. Did i need any plugins or something else for adding the textures?
(it says 'invalid image file header' )

Would be great if someone could help me because i am a newbie with 3ds max ^^

Hi, there is still someone interested to this?! (I hope yes)

Thanks for this script, is really great to import dragon's prophet models... but sometimes some models make 3ds crush and/or run out of memory the system.

However do you still have something for .ras animations?  just to import them or directly convert them to .fbx
