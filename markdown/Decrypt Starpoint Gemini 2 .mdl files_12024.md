- Post Title: Decrypt Starpoint Gemini 2 .mdl files

Hello, i've been trying to convert this .mdl file of a SpG2 ship, but it looks like it has some sort of encryption. 

I've been using all kinds of software, from 3D object converter to Cannonfodder's MDLDecompiler, even hex editing (although i don't know much about this last one). 

I want to tinker with the models and see what i cand do with them, i just need to convert them into a format i can work with (either .obj or .3ds), but i've got no luck so far.

Here is the file: [https://mega.co.nz/#!vkoj3DBK!Pq6K5Bdsa ... eSMhy4umEM](https://mega.co.nz/#!vkoj3DBK!Pq6K5BdsawTEDZ0HFR4UffLxYlb3bO04PeSMhy4umEM)

It doesn't look encrypted. You'll need to figure out the format of the vertex data, etc.

I added the Whale 2 Engine Binary (Starpoint Gemini 2) .MDL loader module to the 3D Object Converter.
I released it as a web update, so just use the Help/Check for updates... function to get it.

I will add the Whale 2 Engine ASCII (Starpoint Gemini 2) .MDL loader module to my program later.
