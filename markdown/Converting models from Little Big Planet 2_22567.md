- Post Title: Converting models from Little Big Planet 2

Hey, so I'm in the process of trying to convert models from Little Big Planet 2. They are in the .mol format with a .MShB header. Using the small info I can find from searching, I used offzip.exe to decompress the file into .dat but at that point, I'm completely lost on what to do. Could anyone help?
