- Post Title: Final Fantasy XIII - Seventh Ark

Hello, It's my first time here. I don't know if this is the right place to post about this.

I've been reading many posts here about a lot of great work on researching FFXIII game series.

I've wonder however, why anyone didn't noticed the presence of an entire chapter, unused in FFXIII. It's the Seventh Ark. A cancelled DLC for the game.

I have managed to mod a savegame using FFXIII Encryptor to make it load and even go beyond a door that is closed by default. Some more modding allowed me to load a battle against a modified version of fal'Cie Anima, called Nemesis in a battle arena later used in FFXIII-2, in the proto fal'Cie Adam battle.

Going further away in the modding, I made a savegame unlocking the entire map, showing three areas. And this is the place where I'm stuck. I just can't mod the save to be able to reach and explore these areas. I only have a OFW PS3, and lack any advanced knowledge in game modding, this is actually the first time I do modding on a game.

Anyone is welcome in trying to access these areas or even make this unused chapter work. I hasn't surrendered yet, but I just don't know how could I do it after trying a lot of stuff without success.

All my research, and modded FFXIII saves, can be found here: [http://jul.rustedlogic.net/forum.php?id=12](http://jul.rustedlogic.net/forum.php?id=12)
