- Post Title: .pgf - Survival Project

Hi everyone,

First of all thanks so much Mr.Mouse for the Survival Project .pax plugin ([5 year old thread xD](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=15&t=1316)).

I need some help with the .pgf images from the .pak file.
As mentioned (by Mr.Mouse) in the [old thread](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=15&t=1316) the .pgf header is missing/stripped.

I don't have any idea how to reconstruct the file header (because it need to contain the width and height etc but the header must be somewhere because the game must have some way to reconstruct it?).

Maybe the file extension is misleading and it is not a Progressive Graphics File?

Example Files:

[http://webpatchhanbit.nefficient.co.kr/ ... 17.pgf.zip](http://webpatchhanbit.nefficient.co.kr/patchhanbit/test_sp/images/game/character/character17.pgf.zip)

(corresponding .spr file [http://webpatchhanbit.nefficient.co.kr/ ... 17.spr.zip](http://webpatchhanbit.nefficient.co.kr/patchhanbit/test_sp/images/game/character/character17.spr.zip) )

[http://webpatchhanbit.nefficient.co.kr/ ... n1.pgf.zip](http://webpatchhanbit.nefficient.co.kr/patchhanbit/test_sp/images/game/weapon/char16_explosion1.pgf.zip)

(corresponding .spr file [http://webpatchhanbit.nefficient.co.kr/ ... n1.spr.zip](http://webpatchhanbit.nefficient.co.kr/patchhanbit/test_sp/images/game/weapon/char16_explosion1.spr.zip) )


.pgf Viewer and 'normal' .pgf Examples:

.pgf Header Infos:

And what's the deal with the .spr files?

Some but not all .pgf files have a corresponding .spr file. Opened with an Hex Editor there is an .bmp file referenced?


Thanks very much for any help / hints.
