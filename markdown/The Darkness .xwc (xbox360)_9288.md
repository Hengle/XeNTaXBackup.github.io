- Post Title: The Darkness .xwc? (xbox360)

hi!

StarBreeze usually compress sounds files in .xwc files.
I tried to use Game Extractor , DragonUnpacker to extract them but they didn't work.Probably the files aren't very similar to the .xwc files from Syndicate because the scripts i found don't work with the ones from The Darkness.
Can anyone help me?

thanks...
