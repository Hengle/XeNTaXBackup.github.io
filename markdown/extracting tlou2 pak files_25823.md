First you install QuickBMS then download the appropriate script to extract the .pak files from The Last of Us Part II game. You can find the script for this game on the QuickBMS website or on various online forums. Select the .pak file you want to extract and select the destination folder where you want to save the extracted files. Click "Extract" to start the extraction process. QuickBMS will extract the contents of the .pak files and save them in the destination folder. To repack the unzipped files into .pak files, you can use the same process in reverse. Just select the files you want to include in the .pak file and the destination folder where you want to save the repackaged .pak file, then click "Package" to create the .pak file.
