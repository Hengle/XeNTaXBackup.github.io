I have extracted some creatures with animations and textures. You don't even have to specify the engine version. You can just open the CoockedContent - vieuw the assets - and extract assets.
After you've extracted the assets you should get a .psk file for the skeletel meshes and a .psa file for the animations wich you can both import into a 3d modeling program like 3ds max. You can use the ActorXImporter for this,  also from Gildor.
This a the "Imainaya" monster as a little video preview:

Thanks you, I found the texture and I'm assigning the texture. Can you share the experience of material assignment ??
When you import the .psk file model, there are some materials that show "" material ". I can't find the material from there. With normal materials, I can copy the name and find materials on the computer.
