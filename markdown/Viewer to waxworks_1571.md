Hi,

it seems Waxworks is now abandonware (source: [http://www.abandonia.com/games/689/Waxworks.htm](http://www.abandonia.com/games/689/Waxworks.htm)).
Maybe it's possible to make a viewer to all these nice graphics (*.VGA).

Could you do this please?

Thanks a lot,
Frank

Hi mate,

I have downloaded the game, and will take a look at it - but I don't know if I will have any success. I only say this because I know I'm not terribly good with images, and the images in old games like this are quite different from images in more modern games. However, I will look.

Hello Watto,

> I will look.

this is exactly what I had in mind. But don't put to much time in this. If it's very complicated let it be, because I am just curious to see the images I had missed while playing the game.

Thanks a lot for looking,
Frank

Hi again,

I looked brienfly at the files, but as expected I didn't have much luck - I don't really know much about the image formats in older-style games like this except that they are quite different to more modern games. I don't even think I was looking the right way at it   . Sorry mate - I'll take a look around and see if I can find any information about old-school graphics on the net.

Hi Watto,

thanks for looking and as I said: It's not necessary to spend much time with searching.
But anyway: If you like the challenge and have fun to decode the format, I would appreciate it very much if you can do it.

Beauty lies in the eyes of the beholder. 
Btw. my words refer to the morbid charm of the images and was meant a little bit ironic. Maybe it would be better for understanding if I wrote "nice". 


Bye and a good night from germany (it's now a quarter past 11 p.m. here)
