Perhaps we sometimes can get a break from the file format analyses and play an actual game. 

What game is on your computer or on your console at the moment? 

Mine are King's Bounty (PC) and Dragon Age (PC), while I have Legend of Zelda: Spirit Tracks for the NDS. 
When I have an hour to spare I sometimes play a game of Red Alert 2 or Warcraft 2.

I have Resident Evil 5 for PC but tbh I dont play it very often, as I finished it and got every single achievement on the XBOX version, currently my xbox is broken and instead ive been going over my TINY TINY ammount of PS3 games, decided to finish all the mission modes in ninja Gaiden Sigma and also finish it on all Difficulties, currently half way through Master Ninja since 20 minutes ago...given up for the day to work on my portfolio again ^___^

Nerf ArenaBlast... and maybe Carnivores/Carnivores 2 (been forever since I really played at all). And my 360 is broke, so I've been going through withdrawal for a while now. =)

Nerf ArenaBlast !! Omg, I remember playing this when I was in elementary school! Recently I've been playing Castlevania Dawn of Sorrow and Pokemon SoulSilver on DS, NBA JAM Tournament Edition and Super Bomberman 2 on my snes emulator (on my modded ps3), Marvel Ultimate Alliance 2 and Dragonball Raging Blast 2 on ps3. Finally, on my computer I've been playing nothing

Ah well, this time around I've got Heroes of Might and Magic VI that I play now, Deus Ex and Mass Effect 2 are also on there, but I already lost interest. 

I am eagerly waiting for Thief 4, Skyrim and Max Payne 3. 

On my PSP I've got Ogre: Tactics, Metal Gear Solid Peace Walker, God of War. 
On my 3DS I've got Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time
I've got lots of stuff for my NDS. 
And also some games for my Wii, though I hardly play them. Come to think of it, currently I only play HOMMVI and Metal Gear Solid.

I've got about a dozen game installed on my computer (including, of course, NAB and C1/C2), but the only one I've played recently (other than the occasional online game here and there) is Minecraft.

PSP: Dead Head Fred, I have to finish it this time! (Crappy controls stop me from doing so...)
Gamecube: Killer 7, this time I will make it past level 3!
XBox 360: Mercury, it was harder when it was on the PSP (and so frustrating...)

Computer: Deus Ex: HR, I hated part of it and loved part of it... not sure what to say, the last three levels were uninspired

Anticipating: Skullgirls, why isn't it 2012 already?

My Toshiba laptop is 3,5 old and is still pretty good but definitely is not cut out to handle modern games. That's what I got PS3 and 360 for 

If I do play on a computer it would be an adventure game, and the last one was Still Life. I do have a bunch of other adv titles installed but that's cause I was extracting pre-rendered backgrounds from them (AlternativA, The Longest Journey, Midnight Nowhere, Next Life, Black Mirror 3, Syberia etc)

On my PSP I just picked up Parasite Eve 1 & 2 from PSN store and had been playing them for the first time ever. Its a shame I never got a chance to play them as a kid, sure would be impressed much more than now, but still... very beautiful and cinematic experiences from PS1 era.
