When trying to request account on wiki i get a error 500 when trying to edit the page: [http://wiki.xentax.com/index.php?title= ... inoguy1000](http://wiki.xentax.com/index.php?title=User_talk:Dinoguy1000)
when clicking view-source on all other pages i see the markup so i think that one page is borked somehow
and i already inquired via PM but got no response and am thus unable to register @ the wiki

Aah, sorry about the silence, masterX244, I've had real-life distractions the past few months to the point I haven't been able to keep up with stuff online very well.

The problem with the wiki is a known one that occurs when you try to edit any wiki page, and started when it was upgraded a few months ago; every time I'm thinking about it needing fixed, I don't have the time to work on it, and every time I do I'm not thinking about it. =X

Shucks. I was going to add two formats to the wiki. Hope it gets fixed soon!

You need to enable account registration or have someone else look at the problem, as its been almost a year and its still not fixed, which means people who want to contribute to the wiki cannot.

Yeah, I will fix this. Dinoguy seems to have other things to do.

thank you much =) Its probably a really simple problem, and if all else fails a reinstall and restoring the database should work....

Much rejoicing! the problem seems to be fixed! =) Do we still leave comments on Dinoguy's page to register for an account?

edit: yep editing a page and saving indeed works, thanks much
