- Post Title: few questions, meg-lo-mania

jut been looking for this old game and got it in this version to run in windows.

[http://homepage.ntlworld.com/mark.harma ... mania.html](http://homepage.ntlworld.com/mark.harman/comp_gigalomania.html)

it a shame that no-one has ever made a new version of this!. so 1st thing i thought of was heading over hear 

i want to upgrade this and if i only manage to make it look better by getting the graphics to look like a 2010 game then ill be happy.

i mess about with 3dmax10 and modding but this is a whole new area for me?.

so anyhoo, is there anyone hear who can help me or point me in the right direction?... ie: graphics and stuff only at 1st.

if things go well i got someone who is good at multiplayer programing so i intend to get this looking good and then working as a multiplayer and then further on a few programming codes to add buildings and stuff to make it bigger
