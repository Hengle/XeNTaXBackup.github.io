This is a trial to see whether we can support a general bullshit forum over here at Xentax. 

It's the only place for your off-topic issues, such as newsworthy news, gadgetery, stories, bitchin', game reviews, game issues and all other things that made you scream "HOLY COW!". 

Have fun. 

PS:

The Miscellaneous Forum posts that are not related to MultiEx Commander (See MultiEx Commander Category) will be transferred here when there's enough action going on.

Yeah, every forum has to have one of these.. The few cases are serious developer sites and business forums. I'd comment on this being the former, but alas.. I love a good place to 'crap'.

Indeed, we'll see how it goes.
