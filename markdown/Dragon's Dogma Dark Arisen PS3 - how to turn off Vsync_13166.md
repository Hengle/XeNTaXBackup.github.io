- Post Title: Dragon's Dogma Dark Arisen PS3 - how to turn off Vsync?

as you know, most files are compressed (or encrypted?) with a SFH header & CRA. i don't even know if the option to turn off Vsync is in the EBOOT or the gamedata itself.

so far ARCtool can only unpack & repack texture files. i appreciate if some people can help me regarding this.

*i'm not used to constant slowdown & i don't have 360 to play the superior version of this game (although it has some screen-tearing)
