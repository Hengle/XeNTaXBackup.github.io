- Post Title: Gundam Target In Sight mrg file

Hi,
Could you  anyone please look at the mrg archives from Gundam Target In Sight
I think they contain the model and textures and animation.
I used some programs to extract files but it doesn't work.
QuickBMS script is very appreciated, if possible.

Hope someone can take a look to this link's file.


Thanks in advance!

I have the MRG files extracted. Still trying to figure out some problems with some of the files though. Silly how an MRG can contain one or more MRG files. Files within the MRG don't have filenames either and the nesting does complicate batch processing. I don't know who namco hired for their programmers, but I wouldn't hire these guys to program solitaire let alone a video game. This game is so messy it was obviously tight on time and budget and met neither.
