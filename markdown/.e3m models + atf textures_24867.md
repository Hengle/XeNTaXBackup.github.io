- Post Title: .e3m models + atf textures

Hello! thanks to Ekey finally was able to decompress the .e3p files and I finally see some info about 3d model data (.e3m files), was checking it for a while and don't found the correct values yet, I only can preview some cubes, hope it not required a script   , anyways any kind of help is welcome! Thanks for read!.

The vertices need to be grouped/sorted, somehow.

```
2 0 3 0 0 0 0  1.527930 -0.559926 0.263543 
3 0 5 0 0 128 63  2.343530 0.220493 0.000357 
4 0 4 0 0 0 0  1.763930 0.216472 -0.000353 
5 0 3 0 0 0 0  1.529470 -0.496457 0.110263 
6 0 5 0 0 128 63  2.252130 0.160468 0.000257 
7 0 4 0 0 0 0  1.672430 0.156608 -0.000251 
8 0 3 0 0 0 0  1.436540 -0.554083 0.110264 
9 0 5 0 0 128 63  2.252210 0.114510 0.110951 
10 0 4 0 0 0 0  1.672430 0.110653 0.110947
...
```
Maybe excluding these
cnt 0 x 0 0 128 63 lines could help?

That way you won't learn anything - indeed it's not too hard, use a FVFsize of 19, exclude each 2nd and 3rd vertex and you're done...(partially)

For the uvs (13 bytes blocks) indexing seems to be required.

Since you didn't mention the title of the game I'll just call it the default importer.

Thought you've already known how to deal with lzma-compressed data.

Yep, Ekey made a script for the .e3p, but these are .e3m, gonna attach the script hope it only need some tweaks .

```
# script for QuickBMS http://quickbms.aluigi.org

comtype lzma86head
get MAX_OFFSET asize

do
   get NSIZE long
   getdstring NAME NSIZE
   
   set EXT extension NAME

   get ZSIZE long
   savepos OFFSET
   math TEMP = OFFSET
   math TEMP += 5
   goto TEMP
   get SIZE long
   
   if EXT == "ATF"
       log NAME OFFSET ZSIZE
   else
       clog NAME OFFSET ZSIZE SIZE
   endif

   math OFFSET += ZSIZE
   goto OFFSET
while OFFSET < MAX_OFFSET
```

What else tweaks do you ever need? The entire file is just a block compressed with the lzma86head algo. And the required script has already been posted in the same thread here:
[viewtopic.php?p=175262#p175262](viewtopic.php?p=175262#p175262)
Just thought that you wouldn't ever need it.

Bigchillghost, one last thing please xD, how about this files? Dunno why they use like three different  filetypes for models, like one for characters, other for monster, another for objects, and also I note that they use a different filetype for skins of mounts or weapons, and for the main leveling weapon uses another, truly a mystery.

I see why it's familiar now. You've posted about that format before. Yet the solution is so inappreciable that I wouldn't it called a script.

```
goto 0x12
get ZSize long
set Size long ZSize
math Size * 20
get Name basename
string Name + ".out"
clog Name 0x16 ZSize Size

```
