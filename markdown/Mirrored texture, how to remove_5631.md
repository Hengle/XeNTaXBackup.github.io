- Post Title: Mirrored texture, how to remove?

Maybe this is a not a specific fileformat question, but I need your help with a 3d model/object.

I have a object of the rear of a car. Now, the object uses only a half texture which is mirrored in the middle of the object. (Because the left part is identically to the right.)
But now I want to use that object to map a new texture which should NOT be mirrored. But I don't know how I can remove the "mirror-effect" from the object.

Just redo the uv's ad a uv map modifier then just choose planar for the unwrap method.

Hey! Don't knock the milkshape!  I use it all the time for low-poly modeling.  It's no 3ds Max or Maya, but it gets the job done.

Milkshape SUCKs.... its an over glorified model viewer, with limited editing functions. these functions arent even decent enough to call MS3D a 3D editor. Use Blender, its free and is more capable then milkshape. I know people complain about the GUI, but your stupid if you don't take advantage of such a powerful tool (and one that is free)

I don't know why people still use MS3D, it hasn't been updated in years. and you'll get little plugin support as its not as community driven as something like blender or 3dsmax

basically what you see is what you get with milkshape, it has a large format support list. but all these are dated, and hardly have a use in modern modding applications

I've tried what you said, but it didn't worked. (not sure if I was doing it right).

If somebody wants to try, I uploaded the model and the texture as attachment.

Thanx for your help.

I'm not sure what editor your using, but these are not questions that should be asked here. you should find the author site of your 3d editor, and ask those types of questions there.

anyway here's what you requested, please post any 3D editing questions else where. this is for 3d file reverse engineering, not how to teach you how to use particular software or how to preform various 3d editing ops on a model

Milkshape its a good program for noobs, like your first CAR, i like milk shape because its more easy make little changues and have a friendly configuration and tools. For more adavance operations like render or advance edition or creation 3ds max and blender are good, but for Low Poly editon and creation milkshape its fine for beginers.

Milkshape would have been kind of half-decent, if it were at least free.
