- Post Title: Could someone try and add support for Harvest Moon BIN & HDT

Can anyone please help me try to extract/repack the Harvest Moon Back To Nature .HDT & .BIN files? I need to know if have, and if have what is the compression used in these files, I tried to use extractor zlib but it only extracted a file, and came to see that the compression was not only that. If anyone knows what is the exact compression, or a tool that can help me, please post...

Thank you for your attention
