Hey, just nabbed Beyond Two Souls for the PC off steam, was there ever any progress in ripping the models for this game?

I have the PS3 files, so all is not lost, but I'd like to see what's different with the PC version.

Does anyone know if the old tools work with the PC files, especially the steam version?

Thanks Ekey, but the code throws a debug error "Utils' does not contain a definition for 'iDebugFile"
