- Post Title: I need uhm..Hyperdimension Neptunia Models ;w;

Uhmm...is it possible for you to give me some? ;w; Or at least rip some for me....if it's not too much to ask..

I saw the ripping/rigging thread of it..and the files were given out but it's in filesonic..so it doesn't work anymore ;o;
I saw the thread with Noire but he doesn't give out the files nor reply to my mails ;w; And I really liked Noire too xD

So...is it okay if you help me in collecting them? ;w;`

I have..
Neptune
5PB
Gust
Purple Sister
Black Heart
Compa
Nisa

Thank you very much!!!
