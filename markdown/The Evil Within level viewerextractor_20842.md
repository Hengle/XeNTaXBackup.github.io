Is there anything that could possibly do that?
I know about WraithLaura tool, but it will extract all objects at 0,0,0 coordinates (unless I miss something).

This tool loads only models themselves afaik.
Are you sure, that you know how levels/maps are made?
I suggest you to look into some Unreal Engine 4 mapping tutorials, so you can get the image how they are actually made.
After that, you'll understand, why all models have 0,0,0 position.

It used to be thing (and in some cases, still is), that every map is a giant model, but as a brief level designer I don't see any cons in that sort of pipeline.
Most people likes to play with LEGO, and it's much easier and faster to edit the map aswell.
