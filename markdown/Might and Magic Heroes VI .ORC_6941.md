Hi,
I also had the same issue using orc_dec.exe, does it mean that we he have to find the key for each Data(*).orc files and if so how can we find them. I would like to rip the music and unpack each archive.
Any help is welcome, thank you.

Thanks to have worked on this but I can't open them.
Are they compressed archives? I tried to open them with winrar and 7zip with no success.

I tried to run ORC_Tools_orc2zip.exe, and it said MSVCR100.dll was missing from my computer.  I took MSVCR100.dll from my system32 folder, and the exe still wouldn't work.  I downloaded msvcr100 from the first result on google, now it just says orc tools orc2zip.exe has stopped working.

Can one of you that has it working send me your MSVCR100.dll from your computer, or give me any ideas as to why mine isn't working?


p.s., once you extract the orc files, does it extract the skirmish maps so you can view them in the map editor?

How you run the program? Not by double-clicking, I hope?

I downloaded the last tool, and yes you just drop the files onto it (well that is what I did) 
it only worked for 1 file, data_03.orc, the rest crashed....

And the data 03 did not have anything interesting about 3D models, it did have the UI in flash file format though

Anyone any ideas?

Strange it worked perfectly for me, I was able to convert all data*.orc files, except the Data with the language (Data.de-de.orc, Data.es-es.orc...) to a compressed zip format. I just dragged and dropped the *.orc archives to the orc2zip tool by muhtar (thank you again).
If I am not wrong the textures are located in Data4.orc, Data5.orc and Data6.orc archives.
Data3.orc contains only the sound of the game (music, voices, effect..).

I believe you are right, the .gobj is a 3D object, I am looking into the anastasya.gobj file, which contains already on first site some interesting data such as textures, bones,standard animation

Just need to figure out the rest :/

can someone with the deluxe / collectors edition extract their files and find the "Heart of Nightmares" map (.scn file) probably.  And post it somewhere I can maybe download and play it?  Would be awesome if that worked.

Multiupload links are down for me as well.

Some gobj files would be cool.

But I'm busy so I won't be able to look at this for the week.
Maybe someone can look at it and write up a simple parser for the chunk-based format.
