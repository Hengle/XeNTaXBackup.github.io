- Post Title: Another World HR Pak File

Ok people, found this Pak01.pak (Data) folder on the game Another World High Resolution version, it has 20mb size.

I searched on google and found this page:
[http://binarybonsai.com/archives/2006/0 ... orld-2006/](http://binarybonsai.com/archives/2006/04/13/another-world-2006/)

There's a post by this guy 'gawd', and he post a source for a program (created by him) that can extract the pak file.... but I don't know how to build it. Anyone can help ?

the source:
[http://www.megidish.net/releases/unpack-aw-hires.py](http://www.megidish.net/releases/unpack-aw-hires.py)

I think you can download the demo and check the pak file.

More info about the game:

Thank you very much.

Just download python, and run the file?
The magic about python is you dont have to compile anything, just running the source will do the trick.

Xpert v2.0
plugin "PS2 Quake 2 Pak0 *.PAK

Unpack Pak01.pak of Another World HR and also Repack (including LBA!)
verified

P.S:Ground not to answer, my english is translated and perhaps it is not understood to me T_T
I hope that it serves my aid ^_^

P.S2:
The program does not work of after making a task, is only necessary to close it and to return open it and to follow with the following step, but it works or, verified 100%!
