- Post Title: Blinx: The Time Sweeper Format - Files from .XBE

Hello!

I've been looking to find someone who might be able to help me create a noesis script (or other extraction tool) for the files found within the Blinx The Time Sweeper XBE Executable.

The textures and material files are all outside the XBE, on the main part of the disk, but inside of the XBE I've found two types of files, MDLs and MAPs. Based on what I've been able to find, it seems as though the MDLs are character models while the MAPs are area models.

I'd be willing to help fund it if someone was interested in working on this type of thing.  Even just getting Blinx's model out of the game would be absolutely awesome!

Here's an archive with the XBE data for reference:
