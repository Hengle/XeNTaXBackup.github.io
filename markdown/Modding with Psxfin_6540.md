- Post Title: Modding with Psxfin

I've recently searched for a new way to mod psx games, exclusively WWF Smackdown !2. I was 
able to rip textures from the game with 3D Ripper x and the Next 3D plugin. I was also able 
to use texmod with psxfin. My question is how would I go about modding textures of the 
characters in game. The emulator is different then using texmod with say, a pc game...like 
tomb raider. If I could modify the textures ripped and import them back into the game, that 
would make a big difference in the texture quality and may have more people into modding 
old psx games. I could really use the help of this forum in my research and my project.

Here are some textures I've ripped:
