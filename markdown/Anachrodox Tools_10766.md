> DATExtract V 2.0 - A tool by John Rittenhouse to unpack Anachronox .DAT files. Includes source code. What would we have done without this???

> lw2md2 V 1.0 - The original program by ION Storm to convert Lightwave models into Anachronox models.

> lw2md2 V1.1 - The modified version created by Laguna. Allows frame extraction to Milkshape ASCII file. "Laguna: Can I release the source code for this?"
>
> NOTE: I did not get the source code from Laguna. Well I did, but didn't. He didn't give it to me on purpose. It pays to be a programmer at times. Szeroki uÅ›miech

> lw2md2 V 1.2 - A modified version of Laguna's lw2md2 by me. Allows extraction of all frames at once by frame name, and a few fixes like correct texture names.
>
> NOTE: Now that I have broken the .md2 file format I plan on creating a whole new GUI version and support for more formats like .3ds, and .obj.

>
> ms3d-uv_plugin - A Milkshape plugin created by Laguna that will create a .UV file required to convert .LWO models to .md2 format with lw2md2.

> Decompile V 2.0 A.K.A Anoxtools- This is an awesome one of a kind program written by Richard Tew. It decompiles APE programs into .txt files which are then editable in any text editor. Any modifications you make can be re-compiled using dparse.exe(comes with the installation of anachrodox 1.2). Using this program requires the installation of Python, and may not be usable by amateurs.

> Please visit Richard Tews google source site at anachronox-modding for details, and where he is making new programs for Anachronox as well as looking for programmers to help him

> winbspc - Currently the best .bsp(Anachronox map) to .map(AnachroRadiant map) conversion program. I would like to make a .bsp to .map converter specifically for Anachronox 'someday'.

> 
>
> Append V 1.0 - A program written by Forcas that allows you to add MODs to the Anachronox MODs menu. Under Arcade for games and Planet for maps.
>
> NOTE: I have not tested this, since the work I have been doing allows almost a complete modification of Anachronox without actually editing source code.

>
> IONRadiant - This is the original map editing program for Anachronox. I wouldn't recommend using this. It is here for preservation purposes.
>
> Actually you can't get it to work, unless you read posted messages by me, and Species on PlanetAnachronox about the program.

>
> Language Tools - The Anachronox language translation tools created by MNEMONIC.

> 
>
> Quick Coder - An APE code editor by Jesse Coyle.You could always use Ultraedit, but this has the nice feature of compiling your code from within the editor.
>
> 
>
> MorphObjectExportto3DS.ms - A currently unreleased 3d Studio Max Morph to Lightwave export plugin created by me. Makes it a lot easier to export model facial or body morphs from Max to Anachronox .MD2 format.
