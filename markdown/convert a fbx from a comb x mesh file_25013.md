- Post Title: convert a fbx from a comb x mesh file

Hi ... I have a very special question regarding my suburban mod for the great snowrunner game:

look at the attached files and photos ... is there a way to "re-produce" the fbx file from the
combined x mesh file?

workflow:
1st.: making the 3d model using 3ds max 

2nd.: exporting as fbx //picture2

3rd.: integrating into snowrunner

4th. ... if there is no error in the game - snowrunner will make a x mesh file from my modded car ...

is it possible to convert an 3d file //like fbx or obj 
from the combined x mesh file?

thx in advance!  ezio
