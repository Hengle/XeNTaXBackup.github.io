- Post Title: Ninja Assault (ps2) data.bin

I'd like to be able to extract the contents of this file.

This is an older game developed by namco, originally for arcade. I own the game and can provide the whole file (which is almost 600 MB), or a smaller piece/pieces.

My email address is [gruby22@hotmail.com](mailto:gruby22@hotmail.com) .

Would it be illegal/ against the rules to just post a small sample?
