- Post Title: Converting models from PS2 - Roadkill

Sorry to be a pain and ask, but does anyone know anything about .SMB models from PS2 games? As I've managed to get into the .ISO file from a favourite game of mine, Roadkill. But the models are in .SMB format, and I've peeked around on google and come up with nothing sadly. If it helps I've uploaded what I believe is a model of one of the vehicles of the game and it's separate parts, but I'm not 100% sure it's all the parts of it. If it helps Roadkill runs on the infernal engine, which i believe is an inhouse engine sadly. Not entirely sure but. If anyone's got any clues and would be willing to help I'd be very greatful.

My plan if I can get the cars converted is to set them up for Carmageddon Max damage and possibly do high poly remakes. As the camera angles from the game leave a lot to be desired as with most large vehicles all you get is a up the ass camera, which doesn't help  I'm using Blender by the by. That's what I'll be doing the model making and setting them up in.

Apologies if i've uploaded this question in the wrong section.

(EDIT): I've attempted to rip them using the good ol snap function on older versions of PCSX2 so that way I wouldn't have to attempt to diddle around with the model files themselves however the .OBJ has some nasty skewing due to FOV and sadly there is backface culling which ruins the model.

I seen your post and I've been working on a few ways. So far I managed to get some things here and there but I'm still figuring out the algorithm. How was you able to get the SMB file ? I was able to get all the textures to all the cars and the mesh + UVW's but its a mess right now. As you can see here. I have to figure out the projection issue like I did with the Twisted Metal Black models. Which only takes time. But still its a whole new game/setting for PCSX2 Model Converter.

But I looked at the file you uploaded and found its much easier to extract the data through Model Researcher.

Here is a render of the extracted file.

Hope to hear back from ya!

Nevermnd on how you got the models. I was able to find the BMS script and have all the models and textures exported.

I would love to know how you managed to get all the models and textures for the game, I've got a project i'm working on and i'm needing to rip pretty much everything from the game.
