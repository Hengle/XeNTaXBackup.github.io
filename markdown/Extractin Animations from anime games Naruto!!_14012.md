- Post Title: Extractin Animations from anime games Naruto!!

Hi there, 
I was wondering if its possible to extract the animation from naruto naruto ninja storm 3(maybe 4?) or some other anime games
Its for a fun video i want to make!!
I heard that .mot files cant be ripped. Maybe someone in the community already ripped the animation and its on some site to be downloaded.
Thanks in advance!!
