- Post Title: Berserk and the Band of the Hawk PS3

Hello all,  

Need some help from you masters in trying to rip Berserk and the Band of the Hawk for PS3 contents.
Looks similar to Musou Onepiece 3 from the looks of it in file structure sense.
Inside the Linkdata folder it shows the following files.


Unfortunately my skills is zippo in this department 
Can anyone help me out here.I can provide the reference file if required.
Linkdata.a --> [https://mega.nz/#!f112BSgZ!vohWGKTs7RhG ... RWEnI6ulrs](https://mega.nz/#!f112BSgZ!vohWGKTs7RhGWAKBxYGJi1iTTWMqzuFngRWEnI6ulrs) 
Linkdata.b --> [https://mega.nz/#!3xUGFRTK!ruXTa0dPNH48 ... iHlZywN75g](https://mega.nz/#!3xUGFRTK!ruXTa0dPNH48dBiR_sbut-rfDiEKaT4P7iHlZywN75g)
Linkdata.c --> [https://mega.nz/#!at0h2QYB!kydnYajjYqOb ... uJj-Gdj1Fo](https://mega.nz/#!at0h2QYB!kydnYajjYqObzKWCc1EkOWJQV6UP1TFf0uJj-Gdj1Fo) 
Linkdata.d --> [https://mega.nz/#!nhlSnTZK!eA_-xBbUphOG ... -oMVkKvD90](https://mega.nz/#!nhlSnTZK!eA_-xBbUphOGlLOEoY_FychG9JdZfNe-8-oMVkKvD90)

I think there was some ripper for OPM3 source released before.Cant seem to find it in the forum anymore. Anyone got a copy of it? Might take a stab at extracting it. 
Of course if anyone is kind enough to help out, that'd be super.
Thank you for reading!

semory at the XNALara forums created the tool for many of the Koei Tecmo games that use this format. He has an account here but I can't remember his name. I had planned to ask him about support when Berserk came out in the West on PC since that version should provide the best models/textures. 

Anyways, you can find the tool [here](http://www.xnalara.org/viewtopic.php?f=17&t=1001). It does not support Berserk as of right now though.

Thank you very much for the link ssringo 
Awesome open source program. This looks promising I'll dig around and try to learn more on it.
