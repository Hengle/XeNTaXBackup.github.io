- Post Title: Max Payne PS2 .wad

Hello, I am new here, and I am trying to see if I could open the .Wad files from the PS2 version, but no luck.

Not sure if this extension was used by another rockstar game at the time (It was ported by Rockstar Vancouver).

If someone already know how to open, I would be grateful.
