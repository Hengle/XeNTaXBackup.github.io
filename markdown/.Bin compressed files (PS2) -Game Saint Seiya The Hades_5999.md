I'm having the same problem. But the game I'm translating is the Saint Seiya - Chapter Sanctuary. My friend Caws said the forum and said you could help me.

Thank you for your attention

Hi everyone!
I have a project to translate audio the game "Saint Seiya - Chapter Sanctuary" for Playstation2.

[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xv9FTaqlgI0](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xv9FTaqlgI0)

[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtOvuLwKndA](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtOvuLwKndA)

I was currently trying to extract audio files from Saint Seiya - Chapter Sanctuary, PS2 version.

I successfully did it with afs explorer, that recognize adx files.
The problem is with some voices, that are stored as I guessed, in a file for each character:

[http://www.megaupload.com/?d=YG24V13V](http://www.megaupload.com/?d=YG24V13V)

How can I extract the adx present in there?

Thanks for your help

I used the program FJFU ([http://www.hcs64.com/files/fjfu.zip](http://www.hcs64.com/files/fjfu.zip)) made by the staff of HCS Forum to identify files. There are 38 audio files within that BIN. And in every other bin, we have 38 files also. But I can not work with the files.

Help me please.

Hi, in the link is specified the script/structure of the container type FJF (is in .BIN, .TPL also) , so just reading the script you just have to read the file in this order : 

Header   4 Bytes : FJF\0 (0x00464A46)
NumFiles 4 Bytes : Number of Files inside
OffsetFile [NumFiles] 4 Bytes : Offset (beginning) of each file in the FJF
Dummy 4 Bytes  
Data [] byte.. : start in first offset 

The problem is when one of those files inside the FJF container, has the CMPS header, that means it is  compressed or encrypted , and I dont know how to decompress/desencrypt it ..yet  .

EDIT : also I checked the fjfu.c program and indeed it can extract also the container and at the end it uses "mfaudio" to convert the sound to wav [http://www.zophar.net/utilities/ps2util ... o-1-1.html](http://www.zophar.net/utilities/ps2util/mfaudio-1-1.html).

regards

Thanks man!!

I would really like to learn more of this, but doesn't have much experience to easily do it.

Anyway, what I am trying to do is to extract battle voices out of this file and put it back my modified version of it.
I had sucess in extracting the files wiht the MFAudio, but couldn't recognize anything.

I used the program FJFU to the SE_BATTLEVOICE_00.bin
Then it found 38 segments, and I tried to listen the last one. It sounded strange, maybe some kind of special effect or instruments..

How could I find how to do it?
Thanks, you're cool man.

Thanks for the replies friends!
But unfortunately I can not easily understand how to make these changes to the file. bin
I can extract the audio in perfect condition in wav format with PSound. I want to replace them with my audios and then recompress them in the same format to replace the game. How do you do?

Hugs,
Gabriel

The audio archives are speeded up. I used an audio editor and reduced the speed so I could understand the sounds perfectly. Just don't know yet how to find a way of compression to replace them in the game.

mm I think that maybe this is partially the wrong forum section for you , because from what you were asking at the beginning, it was how to extract from the BIN file and now theres something else, so in the steps that were already given to you plus what you really want :

1. Extract the files of the BIN File (FJF container) 
2. Conversion of sound file (format X) to wav,  if not is another container   
3. Conversion of your modified sound/wav to format X
4. Insert modified sound (X) into FJF container 

You are stuck in 3 , maybe if you post what you found in the audio file formats section of this forum , someone may help.

some tips : WAV -> AIF , speedup = sample rate ..

regards

Yes qslash, that is really what I want to do ... can you help me?
inside file. bin, i can see with windows notepad that the audio files have the extension. AIF as you hinted.
I downloaded a program that converts mp3 to aif, but I think it would not work because the original audio is accelerated.
I believe that the staff of the "Audio file format" of the forum can help me to stay with the same sample.
But after doing this, how do I replace the audio. AIF within the file. BIN?

Please! Help-me..

Hugs,
Gabriel.

With FJFU, i can extracted the audios from bin files, but, for finish the job, i need to compress the files again, putting my files inside original bin file.

After this, i don't perturb more...

thanks again

Problem solved.
Thanks to everyone who helped

Algorithm to solve (simplified):
1. Use PSound 18900Hz frequently to hear the voices of the battle
voice and see if there's to be modified.
2. Use FJFU modified to obtain the list of indices of the voices
3. Turn the output of the FJFU MFAudio to extract all the voices in
two versions (raw and wav)
4. Use Audacity to see the size in milliseconds of voice that you will modify.
5. Get the dubbing and edit it in Audacity to a size similar to the
original. Ideally, a few milliseconds is less. Can not be greater.
6. Export to WAV with audacity.
7. Export Wav to Wav with PSound (This step is controversial, but is
required for the next step, the poi MFAudio not recognize the sound
exported directly by Audacity)
8. Open MFAudio and export to the raw compressed ADPCM
9. If everything was done right the file from the previous step should
have a size very similar to the original size of the original raw
(obtained in step 3)
10. Use a binary editor to do two things:
1. put the header 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 earlier
2. fill with the 00 end of the file (before wwwwww) to the file have
the same size as the original raw.
1. Use the binary editor voice in battle, use the indexes obtained in
step 2 and find the beginning of the voice to be replaced.
2. Overwrite the new raw and save.
3. Enter the new battlevoice in the game.


Tips:
Maintain high-volume voice, but the voice is weak in the game.
- (?) The PSound is your friend. If he can not play, the game will not work.
- (?) The MFAudio is your friend, but can be the enemy. Because it
plays anything. Even things that can not PSound. Then the game will
not work.
(?) Need a second check to confirm
