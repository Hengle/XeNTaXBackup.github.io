- Post Title: Is there an ideal file format for vector-based graphics, such as logos?

Hi Y'allz.

I have a logo in RGB/.eps for intros. However, when dropped into PP the color becomes higher keyed. I can convert it to PNG and retain the right color, I've seen. But I wonder if there is an ideal file to use for logos or similar vector-based graphics.

Thank you!
