So, ok... i started remodeled buggy in Solidworks and first printing parts. Buy some parts:
RC motor 540 27T + ESC
2x servo MG 995 for steering
belts and pulley GT2 (yes, 3D printer parts )
milions bolts M2 and M3
lots of bearings 623 and 685
2x shock absorber 100mm
4x tires Tamiya 1.55" (95/35mm)

and result:
