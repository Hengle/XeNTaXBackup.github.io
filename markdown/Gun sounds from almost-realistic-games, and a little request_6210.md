- Post Title: Gun sounds from almost-realistic-games, and a little request

Hello

I have this obsession with gun sounds, since the old days of Metal Gear Solid, Resident Evil (2, 3), Counter Strike, The Specialists, etc...
I'm also a HUGE fan of the Metal Gear Solid sounds (not just the gun sound), they are near perfect.

These last days I've been ripping sound even from youtube videos and from the Generation Kill TV-show, playing with audacity to adjust the pitch for the Specialists HL mod.

I'm just posting here to see if I'm the only one having this odd obsession there :p, so if by any hazard, if you already have some collections of such sounds, please share it with me ! I don't find anything valuable on the webernet...

I'm having a little trouble with all those tools I can find to RIP files from games such as Metal Gear Solid 3 & 4
, Resident Evil 1, 2, 3...

Isn't there some huge list of games with the advisable tool to extract stuff with ?

Regards and keep up the great work !
