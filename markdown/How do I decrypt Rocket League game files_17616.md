- Post Title: How do I decrypt Rocket League game files?

Hi, I assume this is the correct place to post this?
I'm pretty much a beginner on this whole topic, so I want to put in some time to learn how to decrypt Rocket League to create more advance mods.
For starters, what list of topics should I start looking up?
I assume I'm gonna need a good understanding on the process that happens when I turn on and play the game, so any good videos or posts on this?
