Can anyone help me extract sound files from Assassin's Creed

I'm very interested in Assassin's Creed.
How can I manipulate this forge format?

Is there any way to access the forge file format for sound, music and voice, etc?

Help me!

You can extract most of the sounds with decubisnd in zenchs thread but it won't do all music as some are ehaderless ogg and interleaved vox.

I've downloaded the decubisnd and tested.

But it didn't operate well.

two problems.
 one is " very fast speed".  
 second is that files don't have filename.

So I want to play common speed.
And macro creating the filenames.

How can I do these?

You can set the sample rate by going to the set info tab and seting it to the preferred rate on the selected files. the original files dont have names themselves.

Hi there,

I think I can help you. I also wanted to extract the music, just download the current version of the Dragon UnPacker. 
It's available here: [http://www.elberethzone.net/lang-en/dup-news.html](http://www.elberethzone.net/lang-en/dup-news.html)

After you downloaded the program, open the DataPC_StreamedSounds.forge with it.
When the HyperRipper windows pops up, choose the "formats" tab, click "Audio", change back to the "Search" tab and press the "Search" button. It'll find many ogg files then. You have to look for the correct files, because there are also many ambient sounds. 

Hope this helps you.

Thank you.
I tried DragonUnPacker which was the latest beta one....ver. 551beta.
I saw lot of ogg files.
There is one problem that is can't be played although every files has size(not 0).

Is there options must be selected before extracting in the DragonUnPacker?

I wouldn't recommend dragon unpacker as it does not handle all ubisoft type codecs, decubisnd is the best bet of playing most of the interleaved streams in the file.

Sory for my OffTop but if someone needs to manipulate with those damned formats like forge - just read my signature.   

I just wanted to translate this game but

Would you like to explain the terminology that is "interleaved streams" to me?
Or any document or link? please.
