- Post Title: Demon's Souls 2020 bnk/SBlk

I got the Demons's souls Ps5 remake files from psxhax and am looking at the audio.
The main audio files have the bnk extention with SBlk in the header.

Foobar with the vgmstream plugin and Ravioli cannot convert them.
Ravioli sees wem files in them.

I think they have some encryption/obfuscation but i am not sure.

AT9 and XVAG audio files are also used.
Most of those are readable by Foobar with vgmstream, some are not.
