Another mmo tool. Model format is I would say below average, but still fun.
Imports static and skinned meshes, materials, textures, and animations.



Detailed information and tool download.

I finally had the time to test this out!
It seems to have problems here. Tested on 3ds 2017 and 2018.

Only the bones are imported, I tested several files, never got any mesh, which leads me to believe I'm doing something wrong.
Animations don't seem to load too.

I simply select the mhs file and... nothing happens. 
If I click down, the bones will be placed where I click. So yeah.

Hmmm, I got it from their website. 
It was so goddamn slow to create an account, but it used to work.
Has the website been down for days now? Maybe it will come back...

Looks like their website is down for few days, last check was 2 days ago and it functioned.
Their blog is also down (not sure for how long), looks like they packed things and wanished, or wait a few days.
