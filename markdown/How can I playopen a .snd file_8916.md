- Post Title: How can I play/open a .snd file?

Im trying to open/play these .snd file from Silent Hill HD Collection Xbox360 and PS3 but it wont open or convert with any program. I have searched all over google and nothing has helped so far. 

Is this a midi file or something because there are separate music instrument sounds above it???

Thanks   

Heres the file (11.42MB)

Oh how nice. They included PS2 sequence bank headers and custom midi files. And to top it off, ATRAC3 for bank samples!

Judging by the size of the file, I'd say the crap before the ATRAC3 data is really just useless crap and they just pre-recorded the sequenced song into a stream.

hmm. Well is there anyway to view the midi sequence or listen to it.

I looked at it with a hexeditor and I saw "RIFFT WAVE".
