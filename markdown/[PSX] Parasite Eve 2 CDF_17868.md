Hello, I need some help with this game compression method.
I use QuickBMS to help me a little and I got little parts decompressed, it looks like is an LZS variant.
Scripts:
COMP_LUNAR_LZ10,    // scan 260
COMP_HEATSHRINK,    // scan 497
COMP_LHA_lzs,	    // scan 526
DMP files, memory dump and compressed files here:

The decompression function on the debugger start at address 80010050 but  I don't know much MIPS.

Thanks in advance.
