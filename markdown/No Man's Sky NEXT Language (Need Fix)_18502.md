Hello! I extract NMSARC.86055253.pak with PSARC-Decompile-tool, and MBINCompiler to get it EXML example - NMS_LOC1_RUSSIAN.MBIN
After editing I returned the file NMS_LOC1_RUSSIAN.exml back in NMS_LOC1_RUSSIAN.MBIN.
But I do not know how to back all the folders received from NMSARC.86055253.pak. Is there a way to return all files back to to NMSARC.86055253.pak ?

With PSARC-Decompile-tool Should need set all files manually?
