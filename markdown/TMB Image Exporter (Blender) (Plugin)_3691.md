- Post Title: TMB Image Exporter (Blender) (Plugin)

We are willing to pay for a complete solution to this problem, we have the same request posted on a few freelance websites and are willing to pay threw them or separately if you are able to complete this.  

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We are in need of a plug-in for blender to allow exporting of edited images that are in TMB format. We are including a plug-in for blender that allows the images to be loaded into blender for you're reference.

Attachments.

TMB_Import Plug-in - This plug-in allows the loading and viewing of TMB files in blender.

Attachment #2
PC_ASU_CostumeA.TMB - This is an example of a TMB image that the above plug-in loads.

Final Notes.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If you are able to create a stand alone converter, that is acceptable as well.
No additional code about the image format can be provided.
If you have further questions please post them and I will take the time to address each one time permitted.
