Hitman Audio Tools 



This application enables you to extract sound waves from all Hitman game releases. It only requires you to choose game, select its directory and a folder for output files. 
Note: 
Hitman Absolution - extracts all sounds, dialogues and music in FSB format . If you want to convert the files to wav or mp3, seek my tutorial @ hitmanforum.com
Hitman Blood Money, Hitman Contracts, Hitman 2 Silent Assassin - extracts all sounds, dialogues and music in wave format
Hitman Codename 47 - extracts all sounds and dialogues in wave format (no music...yet )

If you want to download it, visit ninearts.tumblr.com, or check out my sig
You need .NET framework installed on a computer in order to run this application. If you have any problems, suggestions, feel free to contact me.
Hope you like it,
Sebastian
