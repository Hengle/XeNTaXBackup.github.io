here the link to the international forum, it's in Russian, but everyone can post in English also - no problems.

research for almost completely disassembling cachemap container [here](http://wolfmap.ru/forum/viewtopic.php?f=123&t=2520&p=39256)

any possible help in better understanding structure of container is appreciate.
