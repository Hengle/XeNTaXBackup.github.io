Thanks Rick, much appreciated.

As an update, Santos over at Relicnews made an unpacker for the oppc files. You can find it [here](http://forums.relicnews.com/showthread.php?262094-TOOL-OPPC-Unpack-v0.1.0). He's also working on a script to convert the dcm files into an editable mesh format.

Any help on getting a repacker working would be great.

Yes, it would be great indeed.   

Major unknown with this format is this big blog of data (288 bytes!) at the end of header section. It looks like complete gibberish, values do not make any sense no matter how I interpret them. The data is also different in every file. It looks like it might be encrypted but I'm no expert in this area.

So, if you can give me any clue what this data might represent, it would be really helpfull.
