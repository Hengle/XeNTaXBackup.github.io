- Post Title: Borderlands Pre-Sequel localization files

Hello, 

Sorry to bother You all, but I'm searching for help everywhere.
I want to ask something about localization files for Borderlands Pre Sequel because I want to translate the game to my native language, so...

Localization folder for INT language have 110 files with text, but other folders (like JAP or ITA) have more, about 850 files with more text, so INT loc are missing a lot of text. I think this is because INT texts are generated from other places in *.upk files, but from which files exactly?

I searched .upk files but didn’t find any text/subtitles files.
Example: Digsite_Audio.upk have GD_Cork_DialogEpisode8 folder with DialogGroups_Episode8.GearboxDialogGroup. Do I need to convert this kind of files somehow or generate? Or do I need to search in other places?

I’m just searching for these ~850 files in INT version, so I can translate B:PS to my native language.

Edit. Sorry, no. It will not shown exactly this message. Hmm. 

Like, first mission in game: follow CL4P-TR4P. Objectives and description of this mission can't be found in INT folder but I tested and found it in JAP folder.
