- Post Title: Red Harlow model/textures for Red Dead Redemption

Hello, I've spent the last few hours trying to find the Red Harlow model and it's textures from my copy RDR GOTY edition for Xbox 360 with no luck. I've extracted all 4 .rpf files from both discs and all I've found was some really low poly model of him.

If anybody would be able to point out the where I can find the models/textures for the Red Harlow model I'd be grateful. Or just giving me the files to unpack would be appreciated as well.

The model that I have insurance. I look but I've seen. The textures still can not draw (or at least I think)
