- Post Title: Earthworm Jim 1 and 2 (DOS)

Recently, I got Earthworm Jim 1 and 2 for DOS. Unfortunately, all of it's files are compressed in a DAT file. The files I'm most interested in are the sound files, which are all WAV files. With some research ([http://www.vg-resource.com/thread-28206.html](http://www.vg-resource.com/thread-28206.html)), I've managed to figure that out, as well as that they're mono and unsigned 8-bit and mostly 22050hz, and begin with "RIFF",  but the files themselves can't be correctly extracted because they're all slightly compressed. Can anyone help with this, and try to make a BMS script to decompress and extract the DAT archives?

I also tried that game extractor, but neither of the files worked.
