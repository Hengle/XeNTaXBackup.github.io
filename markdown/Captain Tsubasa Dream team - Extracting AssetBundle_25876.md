- Post Title: Captain Tsubasa: Dream team - Extracting AssetBundle

Hello everyone,
I'm trying to extract the asset bundle of an android game called : Captain Tsubasa: Dream team 
I was able to extract the main assets which are in the apk file; however, the assets in the downloaded data are obfuscated/encrypted and i'm not able to decrypt them 
while doing some searches in the dumb lib, i found that the potential encryption of the assets is : RSA

so i was wondering if there's a way to decrypt them
