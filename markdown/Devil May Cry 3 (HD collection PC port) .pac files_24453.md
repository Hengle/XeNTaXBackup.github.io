- Post Title: Devil May Cry 3 (HD collection PC port) .pac files

as the title says, i'm looking for a way to open the .pac files from dmc3. i've tried several kinds of .pac extractors but none of them worked for my files sadly. any suggestions on programs/scripts to use would  be much appreciated!
