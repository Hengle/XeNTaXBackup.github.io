- Post Title: Reality Capture Models and Textures

Hello, I don't know if I can post about 3D models from a program but I hope it's ok.
Reality Capture is a free photogrammetry software for 3D scanning, but exporting models costs money. I've found that NinjaRipper works, but it's extremely tedious and crashes a lot, especially with huge models that are upwards of 10M tris and are split into several parts. I was wondering if it was possible to convert the proprietary files that it creates in project folders to obj or something. All files have the same ".dat" file extension and header.
I've uploaded a sample project and some models with only 1,2 and 3 vertices and one with only a triangle if it helps. Hope someone can help me.

Maybe it's too old, since the Ninja Ripper files are named *.rip, so dunno.
(The fmt_ninjaripper_rip.py in the prerequisites is for .rip files, maybe format of .dat is different.)

btw: imho it's very unlikely that someone downloads your .zip file with the need of an extension to be installed

The files I'm talking about are from the program itself, not NinjaRipper. I don't know what extension you're talking about, I never needed to download an extension to download from AnonFiles. I uploaded it to Google Drive.

.dat files start with signature "TBES". Seem to be compressed.

The files i provided are not from NinjaRipper. I don't need help with NinjaRipper, I just mentioned I already tried it and it worked, but it's not very useful to me and I'd prefer if I could convert the files from Reality Capture.

I also think the files might be encrypted, I created 2 different projects and imported the same model into both. I opened the files created by reality capture for the model from both projects in a hex editor and they're completely different but the same size.
