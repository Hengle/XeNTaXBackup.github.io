- Post Title: The Long Dark

Hello everyone! I’m new here and the reason I came here at all is that I tried to extract the *.assets files from the game The Long Dark.

However no method has worked for now.

This was displayed when I tried to open the data folder with Unity Assets Viewer 2.3.


When I tried to open resources.assets with the Unity Assets Explorer 1.3 I got the error: TProgressBar Property out of range.
When I tried to open one of the sharedassets files there were so many entries that before it finished loading it I got the error: Out of memory.

I heard there are newer versions of the UAE but I wasn’t able to find a download link.

Please help!
