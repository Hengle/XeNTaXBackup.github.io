- Post Title: Ripping from a wii/steam game

I need help with ripping from disney princess; fairy tale adventure
I am doing this because I mod for DOA5 and MMD and would like to have some decent quality princess models to use ^^
I have ripped from steam and such before but this game has baffled me a little.
It has wad files, and ive worked with those for league of legends but they dont open with any programs ive used before
and ShowMiiWad doesn't seem to work either

I need someone, anyone, to point me in the right direction for this
ive tried looking for a quickbms script for it but had no luck
if anyone can help, let me kow

Interesting to see such post...

First of all, are the binaries encrypted? That it uses same format sufix doesnt always mean that the structure is the same, can you post an example file? My aproach would be to try and work with the pc version(even if it would be compressed or encrypted you can always dump the RAM part with the model....)
