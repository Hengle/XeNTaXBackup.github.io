- Post Title: Requesting assistance with Shadow of War model swapping

I would like some asstance in a small thing. Basically, I wanted to replace the wraith world Talion Nazgul model with one that exists at the very beginning of the game before you get Calebrimbor back. It only shows if you're seen since there is no wraith world. I will make sure to clarify I have no experience with this and only request someone to help me figure out how to do it.
