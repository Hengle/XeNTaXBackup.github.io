- Post Title: Trying to extract soundtrack from Project I.G.I. (2000)

Hello,
I need help with extracting music from this oldie, which happens to be encoded in a very strange way I've never seen before.

The image I added shows that it's supposedly wav files, but if they are indeed wav, they seem too small (the .wav file on screen should be representing a 3:17 long track). I also uploaded on Imgur a second screenshot [url][https://imgur.com/a/QFQpILo](https://imgur.com/a/QFQpILo)], which is a sounds.rez file, that could also hold something but I'm doubtful about that and it confuses me a lot.
