Hello, I've tried stronghold crusader translation kit for slovak language, however it does not support some slovak letters like č, š, ž, and others when trying ingame. Could you help me out please? Thank you

As you can read here [https://fireflytranslations.forumotion. ... ion-kit#51](https://fireflytranslations.forumotion.co.uk/t5-stronghold-crusader-translation-kit#51)
this translation kit has some bugs and slovak letters are not supported.

Alright, thanks for reply. I found fonts of the game but I have no skills in this area. How can I add the Slovak letters?

Try to use GIMP. After editing go to File > Overwrite <filename> option to save your changes.

No, I can't. If it's not working correctly, then it's probably some issue with the program you are using. You should report it on Github in the "issues" section.
Or you should contact tool's author directly as he put his discord name in the readme file.
