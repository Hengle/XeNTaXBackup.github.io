Hello, I would like to know how can I rip both of the Nissan Star Wars inspired cars/craft models on this website: [https://www.nissanusa.com/star-wars-the ... our-craft/](https://www.nissanusa.com/star-wars-the-last-jedi/command-your-craft/)

They are both in .json format once I opened that page and EagleGet extension permetted me to download one of those two models surprisingly, which I really love both so much that I really want to see them in a game such as GTA V, that would be so cool!
