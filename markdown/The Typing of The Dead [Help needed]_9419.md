- Post Title: The Typing of The Dead? [Help needed]

Hey guys, I always wanted to translate the Typing of The Dead to Hungarian, but haven't seen any clues on how to begin, since all the files are coded and I can't really do anything about it.

The game is just like The House of The Dead, but instead of shooting zombies that ,,appear" on the screen you have to type in the words or sentences above them to kill them. I'd like to edit the text that needs to be entered.

Can anyone help me?
