those are event files; atelier ayesha, like the past 3 atelier games, use phyrengine PSSG.

I want to extract story text from those files but im not sure how. I tried ryder pssg editor and extracted some menu textures that contains menu text but i can't find game story text.The only place i haven't tried is on the event folder that contains those files posted above but i can't seem to extract them.There's also a folder labeled scripts that contains .CNUT files but they don't look like they contain text. I would apreciate the help if it's not against the rules.


Edit: Based on earlier atelier games the text is inside encrypted eboot.bin so im stuck until it is decrypted.Please close my thread i already found my answer.

ah, sorry, the original ripper was OBJ output and thus no weights; i have to redo it, but at the moment I have no extra time .

dear MR howfie
You are my goal to learn
I want to extract the models by myself，not use others tools.
could you recommend some books to learn these knowledge to me
i will spend all my free time learn it
