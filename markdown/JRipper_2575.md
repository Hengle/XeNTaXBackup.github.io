On the wiki there is a program called "JRipper" on the wiki located [here](http://wiki.xentax.com/index.php/JRipper).

I've been very patient waiting for this program for almost 6 months. So I'm wondering if anyone has any more information on this program or anything they could give me, as this program looks very useful for my needs.

Sadly the project seems to have died. But I did find a download somewhere of the tool. I could link you if you want.

Indeed, please do, so I can upload it on the Xentax server as well and link there at the Wiki entry. So it can be preserved.
