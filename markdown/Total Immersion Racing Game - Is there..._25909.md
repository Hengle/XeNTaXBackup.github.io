I got to open it with AnyBurn.
But, the tasty slice of the game (Cars, tracks) is in a file named "data2.cab" that, for now, it's unaccessible for me yet.

Hiya, it's me again!
Look, I got access to the setup and installed the game. Installed, all that chunk of files is peeled and show their true extensions.
Do you wanna a copy of the game totally opened?

Hi! I'm interested in what you got... I have been playing this game since childhood and recently I reinstalled it and though about tuning it out a bit by making it a bit more interesting to my tastes. I managed to edit some parts of the game like the drivers, the tracks layout in career mode and I managed to have also Rockingham, Lister PRO and Pilbeam in career mode too, making the cars in a race 20 (8 PRO, 6/6 GTS/GTs) instead of 18. 

My objective is to have a career mode with 2 cars for every team, bringing the total amount of cars to 34. I already set up all the 34 drivers (which are correctly displayed in the career records menu) and their parameters, but the game still instantiates a maximum of 20 cars, so some drivers never get on track. I noticed there was a value "max_cars" in one of the game config cars, but changing it doesn't increase the spawned cars, so I think there are some limitations in what can be edit in the config files.

Do your totally opened game make possible to edit some, uhm, "core" files which can provide some help to my tweaking by any chance?

Hi! I did some mods for this game. Also I did manual how to start this game on modern hardware (for me is AMD Radeon RX 6600).
