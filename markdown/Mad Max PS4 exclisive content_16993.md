- Post Title: Mad Max PS4 exclisive content?

If I can access my data from the ps4. Is there a way we might be able to access and extract the ps4 exclusive "road warrior" hood ornaments.  I ask cause I've seen people extract data from like xbox live arcade games and from ps4 exclusive titles so I am hoping we could pull the ornaments out of the data since I have the road warrior dlc from my preorder.
