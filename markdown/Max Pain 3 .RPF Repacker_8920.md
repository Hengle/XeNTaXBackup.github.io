About RPF (RAGE Package Format) - [http://www.gtamodding.com/index.php?title=RPF_archive](http://www.gtamodding.com/index.php?title=RPF_archive)

And what do the rules say on this point?

> 12. No warez

> Refrain from uploading any material that has copyrights elsewhere, with other third parties. Make sure that what you share is legal. Also, no cracks. Don't give us that crap that cracks are legit, they are not.

Discussing warez (including sharing BETA versions, or leaked versions) is against the rules and will result in immediate ban from this forum. Downloadable demos and other stuff you can legally get on your harddisk are fair game though.

I feel we must put the money where our mouth is, so to speak. What good are rules if we do not enforce them? I'll return in a few hours to see what it is up with this thread.

Who told u i dont own the game ????? I hope this was some kind of joke u just mention in here. So u can directly shut this forum down if you dont even allow to talk about warez.(in this case we are not). My point is 99% of all posts it it all about talking about illegal things if you like it or not! Whole research scene is illegal(law says strictly, not revers any files what so ever and publish how to!!!!!) I agree to do not post any file but to do no eve speak about this things its crazy, really think about it a bit and you will find this is really wrong. I don't want to be disrespectful, but this is really wrong and i'm sure you know it. Because you can't get this game about a few days before it does not mean others can.

How can you legally own the game if it hasn't been released yet?

How do u think that release groups getting games ? They go to shop and ask pals  Simple as that

EDIT : But does not matter it's your forum, your rules, even they not making entire sense, still yours. So if u feel it does not belong here, wipe the thread pls and i open it once the game is officially out.

I used to be an adventurer like you, but then I took an arrow to the knee.
