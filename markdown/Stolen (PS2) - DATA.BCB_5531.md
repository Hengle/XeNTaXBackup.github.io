Hm, no actually I haven't. Problem is that I can't use gobread because I'm on a 64bit machine and the program doesn't work here...

Well, than you have to install a -virtual- x86 Windows, because this tool can unpack (and maybe repack?) the files. A year ago, I tried it out with the pc files.

Tried gobread on the file but it doesn't work for the PS2 version of the game. Anyone likes to take a look at this? Would be very helpful! Just some hint about the offsets.
