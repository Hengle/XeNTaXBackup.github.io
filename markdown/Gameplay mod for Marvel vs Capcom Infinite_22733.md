- Post Title: Gameplay mod for Marvel vs Capcom Infinite

Hello, I'm looking for some assistance with modding the gameplay of Marvel vs. Capcom Infinite. A very skilled modder has done wonders with his Ultimate Marvel vs Capcom 3 mods and I'm hoping to be able to bring a small bit of that over to MvCI. My programming skills are pretty basic but I learn pretty quickly. I just need someone to help me get started with accessing the files.

Any help with this would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks. That's a lot to take in. I've gone through the tutorials on how to decrypt and unpack everything and I'm at a point where I'm using HxD to view the files but to be honest, I'm not sure what I'm looking at or for.

I was hoping there was someone with some interest in modding this game and some experience in game modding it as I'm pretty new. I'll keep poking around and seeing what I can accomplish but if anyone is able to read the hex files I'd greatly appreciate some help.

Yeah, I've been doing that looking at hex editing and messing around with files in UE but I'm not really skilled enough to lead this charge. I can easily work with someone on the project so long as they have a knowledge of how to do it, but in all honesty, it's not worth the 1000s of hours of learning I would have to do (not to mention testing, compiling, etc) just to get some balance changes. I love the game but I don't have that kind of time to put into a mod. Maybe if it had been better received more people would be interested in helping. Then again, if it had been better received, I might not even need to try doing this, lol.

Thanks for your help
