- Post Title: General - Program that will open all DDS textures?

I found that actually viewing a DDS texture is quite an annoying experience, as there doesn't seem to be a program that will open all 'types' of DDS textures, mainly compression

as an example, GIMP will open them but only with dxt1, dxt3 and dxt5 compression, why not dxt4? =/ 



Any suggestions of programs that support viewing / converting DDS textures that don't have these weird limitations on compression format? Preferably mac although i do have a windows computer that I have access to.

You could try the DirectX Texture Tool from the DirectX SDK.

Doesn't the Photoshop dds plugin suffice? I've never had a problem with it, but then again, my use of it hasn't been too extensive. It does save in a wide range of formats though, and has a ton of options.
