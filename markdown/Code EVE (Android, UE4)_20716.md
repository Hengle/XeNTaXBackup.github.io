Pretty sure this game is call Dragon Raja now.
The last time I checked, umodel doesn't support this game, at least not skeletal meshes. And according to gildor, he won't consider spending time on it in the future.

But you can always get a few meshes manually of course.

Well Dragon raja, with that same icon, is what pop up if you simply look for "Dragon raja Tencent" so we can be pretty sure that's the game~

On another note, Tencent has this kind of custom png format, it use it also for unity games, nothing much we can do about it unless someone write some kind of script to extract them (unity and UE .png also look quite different in HxD)

I wrote a BMS script to unpack assets from this game a few months ago. Works also with other games of the same arc format. Just feel that it might not be a good idea to publish it before the game's official release. But anyway let me know if there's a demand.

If you're dealing with a unity game, probably you'll need this one to cut off the useless headers.

Is there a chance for a different kind of link to the whole APK?
I still can not get the actual file, no where to be found, all I got on Google was a file called  2017_com.tencent.lzhx_h8754_1.2.2_7fc2c1.apk
and having doubts if its same thing.

Guess it is. Here's the one I used for the analysis: [longzuhuanxiang.apk](https://down7.cudown.com/app/longzuhuanxiang.apk). Seems to be version 1.0.

No interests in the game. But if this's the version you're referring to then both the script should work.

Hi!!
Since the game was censored with the OBT, I'm looking for a copy of the Chinese CBT3 or earlier to get the uncensored models.
If someone could help me I would be very grateful.

Same format. Just with a different compression. Here's the updated script.

It works!the models are like this "jixiedilong_zuoqi.fbx.asset.u3dext", I deleted the extra row on the header  and save it as "jixiedilong_zuoqi.fbx.uasset" and it can be opened with AssetStudio. Gonna be checking were are the textures or how to open .u3dext directly xD.

These is also a new game using this package format.

[https://play.google.com/store/apps/deta ... t.yslzm.gp](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.szn.gat.yslzm.gp)

It seems that this format is exclusively used by games made by ZuLong company (including Dragon Raga, Perfect World)
This format can dated back to 2006 in Internet, where you can find a manual for a SDK called "Angelica": [https://pdfcoffee.com/qdownload/angelic ... -free.html](https://pdfcoffee.com/qdownload/angelicapdf-3-pdf-free.html)

Some pattern to detect this packer:
1. Super BIG PNG inside "package" folder
2. PNG's header is `EF 23 CA 4D`(EF23CA4D) or 4DCA23EF in little endian
3. `AFilePackMan::OpenFilePackage` string in application binary
