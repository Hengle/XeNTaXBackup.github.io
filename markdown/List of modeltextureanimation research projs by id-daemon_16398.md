I had many great screenshots made for all those models. I've spent a lot of time making them. Now I know any time anything can be deleted here. Need to do backups.

Would be nice if you posted the source code too so other people can contribute

also included a noesis plugin for the textures, courtesy of AceWell

to use the model extractor just drag and drop

if you start posting tools here, mods will delete this thread too, and i can lose all the info I gathered here

depends on what happened here. We need to know this first. If noone answer, I can always post it all again and see what happens then. Because right now I got no answers, no warnings, nothing.

i think i know what happened, recently there was a spambot posting hundreds of threads and someone also
posted in your thread during that time which put it in the middle of those many spam threads, maybe the
mod that deleted them tried to wipe a whole page at once to make quick work of it but didn't check to see
if there were legit threads among those. yours probably wasn't the only legit thread deleted that day.   
the site admin should have the power to restore anything deleted though, hoepfully.   

> Reply from daemon1

> @acewell, do you have backups of your scripts?
i'm afraid not, though in light of these events i have started to back up the rest of my attachments etc.
i thought we were past all of this from the last time we lost many posts in the "great link purge" which is
why i didn't bother to back them up.
