- Post Title: Newb in Need =P

Hey everyone, im new to this page and new to this scripting world in general. I found all of this through research online. Im trying to pull sounds from Star Wars: The Force Unleashed to mess with and modulate. Just a fun project that isnt going to be public or any of that. Just my own thing. I found a few posts on here but like i said before, i know literally nothing about how to use all that is on here. I was wondering if anyone was successful at pulling things from the game files because they are obviously compressed like most are nowadays. I saw 2 scripts that people said work but i dont know how to even run scripts. Anyone have any friendly tips for me? maybe a lead to making this easy on me? Thank you in advance guys. Just need some guidance =)

Most scripts posted here use a program called QuickBMS so definitely use that

what script did you use to get the audio files? I've tried a few different scripts but none of them are extracting files.

I'm also hunting for more UA, UP clues 

Thanks
