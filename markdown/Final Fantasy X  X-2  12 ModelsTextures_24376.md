- Post Title: Final Fantasy X / X-2 / 12 Models/Textures

I have been working on a Remake of Final Fantasy 10 in Unreal engine 5 and have run into a problem. I have all the Models extracted but I don't have any of the textures.  I did get the texture converter to work but when I try to open the .dds in gimp it gives me an error

The discord link below is to my server where I have a files channel.
This is where I have all the unpacking and packing files for modding that I have found.
