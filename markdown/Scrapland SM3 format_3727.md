- Post Title: Scrapland SM3 format?

Has anyone ever created a converter for Scrapland models? I know it's an older game, but it has surprisingly nice meshes and large textures (1024x1024).

I think it's Quake 3 engine based, but I can't tell if the sm3 meshes are a derivative of the MD3 format.

Here is a link to some meshes if anyone  thinks they could figure it out:

The ".packed" extractor thread is here:

or you can use the "watto game extractor", .....or you can pm me
