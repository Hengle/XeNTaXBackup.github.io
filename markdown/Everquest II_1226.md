I'd love to have this one decripted... namely because I can't even tell where the actual files are themselves!

Also, if at minimum, does anyone know how to remove the clothes that the player wears when he's wearing nothing else?

Thanks,

Do you have some files we could look at? Thanks!

You'll have to register to be able to attach to posts. 

Also, we've created a tool that will cut the first and last part of a large archive  so those can be send or uploaded instead of a huge archive file.
