- Post Title: Ed Edd n Eddy Mis-Edventures Archive (.ps2)

Well, I have the game Ed Edd n Eddy Mis-Edventures and I want to mod it.
I have modded sound(make a raw file with MFaudio with the frequency as 21000 and the 1 channel, then replace MUMENU.STR with Whatever.raw except you have to rename whatever.raw to MUMENU.STR and replace it)
but I want to mod Textures, and stuff like that. The Archive is in .ps2 format.
