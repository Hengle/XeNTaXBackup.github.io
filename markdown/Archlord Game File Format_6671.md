I found a tool to decrypt the index file after that the extractor is easy.

quickbms script to extract these.
make sure you use the ini decryptor first.

```

open FDSE Data.Dat 0
open FDSE Reference.Dat 1


get files long 1
get foldersz long 1
get folder string 1
string folder + \

i take the time of chrox to develop this script for this game and i think its a record, 4 days, incredible, but also i have a question this code to decrypt the textures, how to use this?รง
i need save this like a .exe file and drag the textures to the .exe?

goto 0x80
set MEMORY_FILE binary "\x44\x44\x53\x20\x7C\x00\x00\x00\x07\x10\x0A\x00\x00\x04\x00\x00\x00\x04\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x01\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x20\x00\x00\x00\x05\x00\x00\x00\x44\x58\x54\x31\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x08\x10\x40\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00"

Only the textures are encrypted do not encrypt the model files.

mmm i dont know but i have troubles only with Characters models and textures, objects models works fine and also textures continue with troubles... only to understand this think, i follow this steps.

1.- I drag the characters.dat (Meshes) to ALCryptDecryptINI.exe

2.- I use this quickbms script to unpack the files in character.dat (230MB Size File)

```
#Archlord PC
#from chrrox

open FDSE Data.Dat 0
open FDSE Reference.Dat 1


get files long 1
get foldersz long 1
get folder string 1
string folder + \
for i = 0 < files
    set name folder
    get NAMESIZE long 1
    getdstring name1 NAMESIZE 1
    string name + name1
    get offset long 1
    get size long 1
        log name offset size
next i

```


3.- I download and put in MAX the file 
Archlord3.rar (the maxscript file inside of this .rar its Archlord2 name)

4.- After of this i import the files in max but i have error. Tested in max 9 and max 10.

FOR TEXTURES I TRY THIS 2 WAYS

1.- I drag the texture .DAT file to ALCryptDecryptINI.exe

2.- I use this QuickBMS script to extract the DDS files from DAT.

```
set MEMORY_FILE binary "\x44\x44\x53\x20\x7C\x00\x00\x00\x07\x10\x0A\x00\x00\x04\x00\x00\x00\x04\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x01\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x20\x00\x00\x00\x05\x00\x00\x00\x44\x58\x54\x31\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x08\x10\x40\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00"
get dxt long
get height short
get width short
get null byte
get mips byte
putVarChr MEMORY_FILE 0xC width long
putVarChr MEMORY_FILE 0x10 height long
putVarChr MEMORY_FILE 0x54 dxt long
get size asize
math size - 0x90
get name basename
string name + .dds
append
log MEMORY_FILE 0x90 size
append
math size + 0x80
log name 0 SIZE MEMORY_FILE
```


After of this i get a single 200MB DDS file.

The other way i try with textures its not drag the files to ALCryptDecryptINI.exe But a the least i have the same 200MB DDS file.

Something Idea or correction are welcome.

make sure you use the ini decryptor first.
Code: Select all#quickbms script
#Archlord PC
#from chrrox

open FDSE Data.Dat 0
open FDSE Reference.Dat 1


get files long 1
get foldersz long 1
get folder string 1
string folder + \
for i = 0 < files
    set name folder
    get NAMESIZE long 1
    getdstring name1 NAMESIZE 1
    string name + name1
    get offset long 1
    get size long 1
        log name offset size
next i

Ok bro i lost here, how to use the ini decryptor first? Its only for textures right?.
Also i try the same with Textures with ini and withouth ini but this its rare also i have the same error of criticalerror on this post

[viewtopic.php?f=16&t=6393](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=6393)

the texture found its 1 in 0 seconds and the file generated its a big .DDS.
maybe its the QUICKBMS version, i search QUICKBMS latest version but i found a lot of trash in the net, if anyone can post here the latest version of quickbms this can be usefull.

Step1

Only decrypt the reference files that is it nothing else.........



After the textures are extracted you must run the ini decryptor On the small texture files only.
Also you must use the key command with it.
The key to use on ONLY the textures is asdfqwer

Forget animations, only textures its a head pain, cause the name of the meshes its like this:

0646a00

and texture name its like this

963258

and the total of textures extracted its around 4000 or something.

its a true problem found wath textures are for the meshes.

Well i found this interesting in the .ecl files (3D format), the file already have the name of the textures necesary for each file, the true problem its in something point the extractor or the plugin of chroxxx flat all the objects, here a sample of one file with multiple textures but flated objects group.


This its curious, here the model have 2 objects, one its the armor body flated all, but the weapons its not flated, maybe this can help to understand how to fix the flated parts.

Hello everyone,

I'm in need to advance on that subject, because the server side has been reworked entirely and i'm stuck on graphical import. 
The issue i have is about animations that are based on Renderware and some others files that have .dff files packed in a .dat (different script to be used)[/b].


Indeed i can see IK points to keep the consistency of a 3D model, however i can't find how to use the animation .ean to make that model moving.
I think it's about import, since the extension is based on Renderware software and i currently don't really know how to use, since Renderware's files seems to be hard to convert ?

Some files are packed with several .dff files and we would like to be able to use them, can someone do a QuickBMS script for thoses ?


Can someone help with some wisdom ? 
I'm willing to make an entire community happy with a real server.

Any chance someone could take a look at animation files again? Those are .ean files which are actually dummy renderware files with the animations inside.

No clue what file format those are in, I don't have any idea where to start...



Any help would be much appreciated! The 3dsMax importer from Chroxx helped a lot already, it would be nice though to have the 100% correct animations as well though.

Hi,

Would it be possible for someone to look into this again? i'm looking for the models with the animations for messing around with them in Unity.

Regards,
