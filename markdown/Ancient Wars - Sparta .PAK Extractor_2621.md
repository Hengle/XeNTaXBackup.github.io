Hey, i would like a copy of your app too if possible, but your link doesnt seem to work anymore. Please email it to [degrachem@ffg.net](mailto:degrachem@ffg.net) or upload it straight to the forum. I like the Dynemedion music in this game.

Thanks, Savage. I got the files I needed from the Pak Extractor. Now the music files are in .ogg format, but unplayable. I downloaded all types of ogg codecs and filters, still nothing. EXTRACTOR recognises them as .ogm, but I still cannot get them to play on ogm supported players.

Any suggestions?
