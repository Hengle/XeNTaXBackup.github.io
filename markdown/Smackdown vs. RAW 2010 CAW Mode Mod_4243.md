- Post Title: Smackdown vs. RAW 2010 CAW Mode Mod

Hi, please forgive my noobishness (is that even a word) and I hope this is in the right section. I had an Idea involving the PSP CAW mode. As we all know the PSP CAW mode is pretty poor, so I thought If it would be possible to hack another CAW mode, say from SVR06 on the PSP. I guess it the probably the same as hacking the old models in from Svr06/07/08/09. but instead of editing chX.pac files You'll be editing edXX.pac files (I guess). I tried just simply copying the svr06 edxx.pac files to svr10 replacing them but it didn't work obviously. So Yeah this is just a rough idea I thought of since I hate struggling with the CAW mode on SvR10. Even if this is possible I'm not the right guy to execute this since I don't even know how to extract the .pac files. So yeah any ideas/comments/feedback/help would be very much appreciated. 

Also I have included a ed02.pac from both SVR06 and SvR10 (there are 64 edXX.pac all together, I just included one.)
