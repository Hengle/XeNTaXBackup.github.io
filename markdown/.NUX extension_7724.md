Is this your game? I haven't used that 3d program before, but there are users on here that do use it.

Nero can not make a backup of a encrypted ps3 game disc.
and the files you posted are unencrypted.
Therefor you pirated the disc.

On another note the format looks very easy almost identical format to IdolM@ster so i bet its the same engine.

You could have told the truth at first. The community is pretty understanding.  Chroxx is a good user and coder, i'm studying his tut on quickbms now.
