- Post Title: pkd / ppk files

So I was playing some old ps2 games via pcsx2 and while playing some Gundam seed desinty generation of CE, i was pretty amazed by the quality of the models so i scoured this logs of pcsx2 when a battle starts and the models load and found a .AFS file.

I then extracted these to get another 3 sets of .afs files and a .bin, but i ignored that and continued to extract the remaining 3 afs files, only to get some excel files which contain unit values and those pkd and ppk files. I am wondering if anyone knows how to open those 2 file formats?

Cheers

Bump up. I need this too. I do extract sengoku basara 2 heroes and i got same files with you. But maybe this game more difficult to extract. Because alot of different file inside Afs file.
