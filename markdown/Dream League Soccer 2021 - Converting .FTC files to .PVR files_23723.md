- Post Title: Dream League Soccer 2021 - Converting .FTC files to .PVR files

I am currently extracting files from a game called Dream League Soccer 21 for personal use. Files are pretty simple to extract by opening the .APK as a .ZIP and using Aluigi's Dls20 script ([http://aluigi.altervista.org/bms/dls20.bms](http://aluigi.altervista.org/bms/dls20.bms)) to extract the .PAK files that contain assets. Now, inside these .PAK files are .FTC files which can be converted into .PVR files. However the script that can convert these files, provided by Acewell ([https://zenhax.com/viewtopic.php?f=7&t= ... 740#p46740](https://zenhax.com/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=11180&p=46740#p46740)) which they updated for transparency, does not seem to work for most .FTC files. Viewing the resulting .PVR files with PVRTexTool or XnView with the PVR plugin, either crashes the application or gives an error message. I am also attaching .FTC files and scripts I used for reference. Any form of help would be appreciated.

These files seem to be encrypted or compressed, unfortunately without finding that out I can't help you.

exported_1331dbf3_00.pvr end icon_mm_transfers_large.pvr.pngI'm sorry, I was going to ask one more thing. I converted the .ftc files to .pvr, but I still can't see it as an image, I would appreciate it if you could explain it to me in more detail.
