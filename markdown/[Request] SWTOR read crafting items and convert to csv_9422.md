- Post Title: [Request] SWTOR read crafting items and convert to csv

Hello Community,

I was following up on [viewtopic.php?f=10&t=7186](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=7186) , but unfortunate, I ain't speak C   and most of it is about meshes, GFX and sound.

Maybe someone can help me out, as EasyMyp doesn't seem to do the job for me either.

I'm looking for a tool to extract the following data or ofc, the data itself would also be grant   

The following data would be of interest to me:

1) The crafting materials, in the following form:
GNOM_ID, Material_Name

2) The crafting recipies:
Object_GNOM_ID, Item_Name, Item_Type, Material_GNOM_ID_1, Ammount_Needed_1, ..., Material_GNOM_ID_n, Ammount_Needed_n 

Item-Type as example: Heavy Armor or Shield or Focus

3) The crafting type:
Object_GNOM_ID, Crafting-Skill

Crafting-skill as example: Synthweaving or Armormech

4) The item values:
Object_GNOM_ID, Attribute_1, Bonus_1, ..., Attribute_n, Bonus_n 

Any help / assistence would be more then welcome!

Thank you for your help in advance!
