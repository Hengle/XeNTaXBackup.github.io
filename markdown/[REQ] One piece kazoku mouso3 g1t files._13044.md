Idstring is same as G1TG0060. But Texture finder can't catch the image and bms script for G1TG0060 doesn't work at all.

having done a forum search for G1TG0060 you'd found chrrox' dds.bms script here:

You'll have to add some dxt header (try the extracted 128 bytes dds file) to the extracted 64k/128k/512k dds files.
(I didn't bother trying which.)
