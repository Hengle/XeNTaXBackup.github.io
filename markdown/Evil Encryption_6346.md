Anyone recognize the encryption used in these files?
1.dat and 2.dat basically contain the same data, the files are almost identical except for the last 8 bytes.
4.dat contains a completely different file, it's included to show you the file differences, although most of the data is different, the DA06936CA32C66D0 from offset 18 is the same for every file.
All files contain the same style header, word secure followed by 2 4byte words which differ by about 8 but sometimes they are the same value.

Just putting it out there to see if anyone knows what the encryption method is, makes for a good exercise if nothing else.

The internet....... 

From the mechwarrior 4 mekpak3, got a 3D model converter for the .erf files, mektech went and encrypted their mechs so no-one could steal them, which is exactly what needs to happen.

I believe the key is NV12NV24YV12UYVYYUY2AI44AI88AYUVAIP8AV12PLFFNVMDNVDPNVDBSSAAATOC

Sorry to bump such an old topic, have you managed to decrypt the .erf files from the mekpak 3 ?

No sorry, needs someone with the program to save the data after it's been decrypted by the program.
