The developer made quite a few games. Their files always consist of .00X files and .bin files.
So far we had for all of their games BMS scripts. Afaik you only had to get the decryption key from the exe to update the bms script.

Also interested, best bet would be to pm aluigi the exe in private. I don't have the game yet, though.

Edit: The filename tables are what's compressed right? because I can see the files with a hex editor inside the 000's'

Double Edit: It's more complicated then I thought.

Even the common sound format is different from goldeneye wii, it's one big package instead of individual sbnk/ngca/musx headers. does seem to have a very clear pattern in a hex editor, scrolling through the file, i noticed on repeating character in the same column and every other row, going A B C D E F G H I ... Etc. Pretty much an alphabetical order which is REALLY weird for sounds. I can only guess that the sounds alone arent raw, but some custom adpcm variant. Dammit, what ever happened to dev's throwing wav/ogg files in a zipped folder. ( I guess we happened lol)
