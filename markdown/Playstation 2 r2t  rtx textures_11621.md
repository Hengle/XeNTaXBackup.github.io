- Post Title: Playstation 2 "r2t" / "rtx" textures

I extracted some texture files from a game archive, and I'm wondering if any of you know how to open them. The file extensions are "r2t" and the first 3 characters of the files are always "rtx."

First 0x70 bytes:

```

Seems like RGB data but I can't tell much with those file samples they are all the same size doesn't help with deciphering the header

112byte header
