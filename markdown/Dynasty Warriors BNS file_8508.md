Hello, first of all excuse my english I am not native speaker.
I'm sorry if this has been already answered I searched forum but didn't find much.
I don't know if it makes any difference but I have Dynasty Warriors 2 for playstation 2 game and it contains LINKDATA.BNS file which I cannot extract.I'm kind of noob at these advanced things that's why I'm asking. and also what is .SDF file? You would really make my day if you helped me.
