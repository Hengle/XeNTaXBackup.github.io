This file is too small for a texture. It's size is 44 bytes.

You should look for textures in other files.
Also check out this topic [viewtopic.php?t=15540](https://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?t=15540)

And what game is it from?

I tried a few of the texture viewers and converters listed in the post you gave but none of them work and all the texture files I want to edit are the same size. The game is called Imagine Champion rider the data texture and stuff are contained in a .bf file which can be extracted with a specific quickbms script and this is the texture format given.
