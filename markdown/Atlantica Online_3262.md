This game is quite good because the files are already native .nif files that can be imported into max.

There is one problem though, the textures that are provided are .dds texture but not standard. They have made their own. So i can't use dds converter or photoshop to change them.

Anyone know how to read non-standard dds textures?

I add a dds texture here in the thread.

This is what file looks like in hex workshop in the top lines, in the right column:

```
...................................
.......DXT1.................
.....@.....................UUUU....
```
