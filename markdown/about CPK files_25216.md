- Post Title: about CPK files

hi, i have done some graphic mods on GLADIATOR BEGINS psp  using the CriPackedFileMaker tool for to extract folders inside data.cpk file .
the problem is about the rebuilding !.. when i try to rebuild data.cpk file the  CriPackedFileMaker creats a new data.cpk with a different size ( the mods i have done has same size of original textures i changed) and the game don't start on psp.
lookin' inside the new  data.cpk file ,usig the hex editor, i see a different  look  respect the original ..i suppose this is the problem why the game don't works.
does anyone have some advice to give me to eventually solve the problem of rebuilding the file  data.cpk?
i have tried all the options of CriPackedFileMaker rebuilding  cpk file  tool , but nothin' change..
