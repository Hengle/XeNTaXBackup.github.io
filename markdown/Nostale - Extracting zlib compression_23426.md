- Post Title: Nostale - Extracting zlib compression

Hello
It's just a settings file which stores text information, I think it's zlib compression, but I tried all the tools and nothing helped.Someone can tell an zlib unpacker who can do it?
I tried QuickBMS, Offzip none of this helped

It doesnt't look like ZLIB at all.

There is some weird header starting with "AC 0B 3F",
then there is list of pointers and there is this header again.

I think that compressed data starts below that and it divided to some kind of chunks

From what game is this sample?

Well, it doesn't look familiar to me.

You can try to use aluigi's comtype scanner with last data chunk
and see if you will get any meaningful results. [https://zenhax.com/viewtopic.php?t=23](https://zenhax.com/viewtopic.php?t=23)
I have cutted it for you and uploaded as an attachment.

I did this, exported all the dmp, then checked them with a hex editor and found nothing familiar

There is some weird header starting with "AC 0B 3F",
then there is list of pointers and there is this header again.

this list of pointers is contained in the text information of the file
