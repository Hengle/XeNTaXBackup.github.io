There's a video in this article: [http://game.163.com/12/0822/08/89GHF4RU00314J6L.html](http://game.163.com/12/0822/08/89GHF4RU00314J6L.html)

Lol looks pretty fun. Run around with girls with guns and blades.

The choice of enemy designs were kind of interesting.
But I was too busy watching the girls with their massive blades to pay attention to what's happening with the boss.

Well, this game seems pretty good, the music is great, the girls are 100% manga-like, and the graphics are very good.

I just hope that it will have more interaction (maybe drive a bike ?)

But for now I'm watching this: [http://game.163.com/photoview/482T0031/ ... C2482T0031](http://game.163.com/photoview/482T0031/42205.html#p=89GKQ6C2482T0031)

I kinda like the setting of the game. I just installed Borderlands on the comp because I really like the subtle cel-shady thingy and this game has similar effect. Will follow this game
