- Post Title: Gran Turismo 4 Soundbanks Decryption [GT2 Modding]

Hello guys.
I'm porting Gran Turismo 2/3/4 Prologue to Gran Turismo 2. (Sound Modding)
Actually, I thought Gran Turismo 4 sound files are useful for porting because of similarity, but I cannot use it due to encryption.

GT4 Prologue's are started from ENGN, but GT4's are started from very different code.
How to decrypt GT4 soundbanks, or someone can make decrypt tool?

Figuring out the encryption with only one file is close to impossible. If you want anyone to actually be able to help you, upload multiple samples of both encrypted and unencrypted ones. That way if someone decides to help you, they can at least verify their work with more than one file.
