- Post Title: Weapons of Mythology

Hi guys i was trying to open the file of the this Chinese(I think) game.
It's name is Weapon of Mythology, the 3d model file are really good(I'm a 3d developer), approximately 3000 vertex for model.

Here is some pak and idx file of the game.

The model inside are in nif format(GAMBRYO). I hope it's not the 20.6.0.0 or 20.6.0.b cause are encrypted and for the moment impossible to decrypt, the texture are in dds. (It's easy to find this information cause is written quite in clear in the idx files)
I don't know how to program in QuickBMS 
Thank you for your help.
