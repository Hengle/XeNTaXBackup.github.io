- Post Title: Hyperdimension Neptunia Re;birth 1 (PC) .pac and maybe .cpk

Was hoping someone can look into this format. Hyperdimension has .pac archives with the header "DW_PACK", and accompanying .cpk files that are really small and don't have the proper Criware CPK header. This game is of particular interest to me because it was originally on Vita. Any help is very appreciated.

Here are some sample files from the DLC section. The main game archives are much larger.

Bump, would be interested in seeing some tools for this game.

Well, that's splendid. At least it's a step forward, though it's still mostly useless if extracted files are still compressed.

Nonetheless, thanks for your effort so far.
