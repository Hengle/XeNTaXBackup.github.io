Hi all, can someone please tell me or send me the .dll files for the game XIII PC version? Again, since I dont have admin privileges on Vista, I will run the game with a no-cd crack from were all the files are. Thanks for the help!

doesn't matter if it's a simple file, it's totally senseless.
then if you have the game why you ask the dll here???
reinstall it!

alternatively download the demo and get it from there:

or alternatively2 download the patch that you need in any case:
