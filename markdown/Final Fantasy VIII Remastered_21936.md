Hi, I'm looking for some help dumping the models from Final Fantasy VIII Remastered.
I managed to dump the zzz archives with help, but I have no idea where to go from here.
I'm attaching sample files.

Any assistance will be appreciated.

Wait, wasn't the game will be separate in parts?
So, the fully game will be in a year?

This is FF8, not FF7 :p
8 = VIII
7 = VII

Again.
This is NOT Final Fantasy 7.
This is Final Fantasy 8.

OHHH.
Well, they is a way for unpack zzz, if I remember right it is possible unpack it with a tool on that page of ff modding, qimm something.
But, you will only be able to use textures, because they have not find a way to either extract models or edit them.

If you read my first post, I said I already dumped the files from the zzz archives. I need help getting the models from the extracted files.

Well, bad luck then. Nobody so far are interesting on give a shot., they are more focus on textures over models.
