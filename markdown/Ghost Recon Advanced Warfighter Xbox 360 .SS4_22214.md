- Post Title: Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter Xbox 360 .SS4

Im trying to get the raw files names (if possible) and also trying to get the music files separate without using a audio editor, they'll read in MFaudio just fine but all the music is in one file and DecUbiSnd doesn't detect any music in the files

.SS4 File: [https://gofile.io/d/9N1Mv1](https://gofile.io/d/9N1Mv1)

That file just contains standard raw PCM audio without any headers or other info.  There will most likely be another file somewhere which contain sfilenames and offsets/sizes of the files in this .SS4 file.

I've just remembered: in the PC version, the audio info and filenames are stored in .XML files in another folder.  That may also be the case here.

You can drop that smaller .SB4 file onto Foobar and it will play the audio with vgmstream.

I feel stupid LOL but thanks bro!

Edit: Could you look at GRAW2 Music for the 360 or PS3, the dragging SS4 and SB4 files into foobar dont read like the first GRAW, i want to see if i can get file names, which DecUbiSnd obviously dont provide

I've had a look at it.  Haven't had much luck so far, but it seems as though the .SB4 follows the same format, although it might be a different audio type that for some reason vgmstream doesn't recognise.  I'll keep trying though, see if I can make sense of it.
