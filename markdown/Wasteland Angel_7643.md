- Post Title: Wasteland Angel

the V archives of the game Wasteland Angel are just ZIP files xored with the byte 0x55.

if you are lazy you can just use my zip.bms script ([http://aluigi.org/papers/bms/zip.bms](http://aluigi.org/papers/bms/zip.bms)) and add the following line at its beginning using notepad:
filexor 0x55
