- Post Title: Is there any software that can extract the model automatical

I'm new, I'm trying to extract the model from the game, but I'm having difficulty. I know something called reversers but it's too hard. Is there a way to extract a fully automated model?

Depends on which model format you're talking of. Read the dozens of post from akderebur, chroxx, daemon and zaramot for example to see which formats they wrote tools (or scripts) for. 

If you think of a general tool that can extract any model, there isn't any, imho.
There's tools like blender (python script), Noesis (python script or 'C') and 3dsmax (ms script) but you need to write specific scripts for them for each specific model format.
