I don't know if there's a way you can do this, but I know a way to unpack and repack files again (include modified files).

Here's the topic: [viewtopic.php?p=44517#p44517](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?p=44517#p44517)

This way i've translated the game into my language and works 100%. 
You can also use the tools to do another mods.

Enjoy!
