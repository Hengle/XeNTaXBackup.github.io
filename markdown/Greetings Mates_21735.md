- Post Title: Greetings Mates

Long ago I was known as Privateer on this forum.
I have tried to log in as such but seems I forgot my password.
I do apologize for creating a new account and hope the Moderators can help me sort the problem out.
I am a big user of SweetScapes 010 hex editor and have got the Devs to add many features with each release.
Being able to call a DLL was one of my suggestions along with a half float ability.
I also suggested being able to open an outside program to view files as a script is running.
I hope to contribute here again as I did awhile back.
