Hi mate,

I have seen this header before but I havn't been able to support these archives. Someone sent me some of these archives from 3 different XBox games a few days ago - i looked at them but didn't get anywhere. I couldn't find any info on the net either.

Any help... anyone?

SFFS seems to be the StarForce (the copy protection program) package file.
No chances at the moment to understand how to decrypt it but never say never.
If the package file is encrypted with a per-game key (probably a public key so is only possible to read but not write it) is not possible to make a common universal extractor since you need to know the public key for the package file of each game (which is an annoying thing probably).
But naturally this is only a hypotesis, no proofs at the moment.
Some games that use this package files are also Incrazyball and Bet on Soldier.

Seems that Starforce sells both exe and package files (aka data files) protection:

Anyway if someone knows other games which use this type of packages I'm interested about.

Ah ok yeah I guess Starforce would kind of explain it.

Um I am trying to find the games that use this protection - I thought there were some XBox games but I havn't been able to find them yet. I know there were at least 3 games total though, and one of them was Bet On Soldier (i have confirmed that). If I nptice any more games that match this, I will post them here for you.

Thanks for your help.
