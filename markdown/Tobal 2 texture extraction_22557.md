- Post Title: Tobal 2 texture extraction

Hi, I'm fixing some stuff in the english patch for tobal 2,
I fixed the menu and quest "action" box widths (right images before fix for comparison):


I'd like to align text on the quest bottom menu background image (the text is in the texture) but it looks like it's not a tim texture,
tested lots of ps1 tools and none found this image, it's embedded in the ALLBIN.BIN with others files for sure.
Could someone please help with this ?
