- Post Title: [PC] Jane's Combat Simulations *.SH format

This may require some explaining. Though this format is documented, there exists no means in which *.SH files can be viewed absolutely and few ways exist to convert them. That is not ENTIRELY true as an old toolkit allowed the conversion to DXF I believe, but is old and only works on one of the current game titles. No help from the toolkit makers or Janes either as they are long extinct. This leaves many people with little support regarding this format.

Documentation can be found here:

The *.SH files use a rather unusual method, being contained within an executable it seems. I'm not exactly sure how THAT works but it must just serve as a reader for the model. In my opinion, the format I do not believe would change much, if not at all, between games.

Anyways here are a few examples from Fighters Anthology. I think many could benefit from this.
