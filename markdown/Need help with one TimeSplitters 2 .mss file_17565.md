- Post Title: Need help with one TimeSplitters 2 .mss file

I've got every file extracted with Vgmstream except for one audio file that doesn't want to be opened and extracted is the Atomsmasher audio file from the Nintendo GameCube disc.

Here's a sample of this .mss file I'm trying to rip:
[http://www.mediafire.com/file/56hbqng9p ... _44_fx.mss](http://www.mediafire.com/file/56hbqng9piek5ek/ts2_atom_smasher_44_fx.mss)

If anyone can manage to extract this, please provide a tool that will deal with this one ASAP.
