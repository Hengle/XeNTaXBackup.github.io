Hello,

Scaled YCoCg DXT5 is a texture compression format commonly used in video games. If you're looking for a software that can handle this format without color issues, you might want to try using Adobe Photoshop or Substance Painter. Another option to consider would be using a dedicated texture compression tool like Crunch or Basis Universal. Additionally, with the rise of NFTs in the gaming industry, see more details [here](https://www.nft360.org/), it's worth mentioning that some NFT marketplaces may have specific requirements for texture formats, so it's important to do your research and make sure you're using the appropriate tools for your project.
