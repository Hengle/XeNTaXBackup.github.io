- Post Title: Disney infinity 3.0 .xwma

I am trying to extract my language from the console version of the game, because in the steam version it has been removed.I extracted the .wem audio files from the pc version with the disney_infinity_new.bms script by adding endian Big at the beginning of the text file, then I used ww2ogg.exe and revorb.exe to convert them to .wav and it worked. (wem files during extraction with the .bms script were renamed to fake .wav files).
In the xbox version, i tried everything, but nothing works, i even tried ffmpeg.
This is a screen of the pc version:

I also attach the .bms script I used.
