Plus heres a tool from Gnie to convert TIM2 to BMP and visa versa

A simple program that is able to convert TIM2 images to BMP back and forth, however it does not support the semi-transparent alpha channel. (if your image has one)

Wow. An extractor for the USA dats. Now I don't need the old tools for the JAP dats.
