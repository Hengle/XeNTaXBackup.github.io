Yep, someone uploaded some sample files here: [https://zenhax.com/viewtopic.php?f=9&t= ... b47986fed8](https://zenhax.com/viewtopic.php?f=9&t=3971&sid=05f5b461161d83c9587872b47986fed8)

Edit: I tried the current QuickBMS Frostbite script and it doesn't work.

its encrypted and obfuscated, unless you wanna dump from ram, there is a bit work to do

greetz WV

EDIT: obfuscation was trivial and game loads decrypted files, from there its basic fb modding
