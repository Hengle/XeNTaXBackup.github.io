- Post Title: Need help with QuickBMS reimporting!

Hey guys.  I have a problem.

I'm trying to hack the DOS game "I. M. Meen" by modifying the contents of the *.LAB files.
What I did was extract the contents of RES036.LAB (the final level of the game) using a QuickBMS script, then I modified a WAV sound file from the extracted files (trust me, I know how to mod WAV files).  But I don't know how to put the files back together as one *.LAB file!

Could someone help me with the re-importing process?

Thanks in advance for any help.

P.S. I've tried the trick with creating a shortcut with the arguments -r -w or something like that.  I get an error saying something about an wrong argument or something...

EDIT: Sorry if this is the wrong forum, just please don't close this thread if I'm in the wrong forum!

EDIT 2: I figured it out!  See this video to see the result of my hack:
