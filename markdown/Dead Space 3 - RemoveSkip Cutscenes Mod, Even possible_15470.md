- Post Title: Dead Space 3 - Remove/Skip Cutscenes Mod, Even possible?

I think everyone can agree that Dead Space 3 really lost players due to the lack of skippable cutscenes. The games been out for so long now that if anything close to skipping cutscenes was doable, I think somebody would have did something with it. What's the main reason for this?

One of the most easy and painless approaches would be to use the "CheatEngine" and then do a speed hack on the game.

Not quite useful, I know, but even if you could cut the times in half would be somewhat a gain.

Unless there are some tools that focus only on speed hacks and do not attach debuggers into your game, this would be much better option.

speed hack still is better than having to wait the speeches out
