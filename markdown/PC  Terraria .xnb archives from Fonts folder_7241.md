- Post Title: PC | Terraria .xnb archives from Fonts folder

Hi,
Is there a way to unpack and repack these compiled and compressed .xnb files. I tried Microsoft XNA, but It does not have such tools.

And , I looked these links, maybe game uses .LZ kind compression. And I dont know how to decompress them.
Thanks for your helps.
Here is the all fonts folder:

These were font files of the game. Texts of the game are in the source code of as strings. So, there is no way to edit it.
