- Post Title: VIS3 files (Deponia, A new beginning, etc)

Seems like there are plenty of games using VIS3 engine ([Visionaire Studio Engine](http://www.visionaire-studio.net)) so i used few hours to write this simple tool.
As probably many of you know, the VIS3 files have a encrypted structure, and the only way to find the right key is to reverse engineer the game executable. Also the key may differ from the different language versions of the games, and as time passes by, that becomes a real pain in the ass.

Using this tool, you SHOULD be able to "predict" the key without needing to RE the exe - just open the .VIS/.VS*/.VC* file and check the result.

Well, i guess that's all. Give it a try and tell me what you think.  

You can get the tool from here: [http://www.nullsecurity.org/gametools](http://www.nullsecurity.org/gametools) ("VIS3 key hound" v1.0)

Excellent! Just one detail - the key doesn't need to be 32 characters long, since only the first 16 are used.
Also, 16 chars long keys work with the unpakke module.
