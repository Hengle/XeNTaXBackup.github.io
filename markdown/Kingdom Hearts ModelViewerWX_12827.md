While there aren't any programs that natively load KH2 map and model animations as well as ModelViewerWX, with Revelation's newest plugins and dlls applied to kkdf2's viewer and Noesis, you can export KH2 character models and their animations, as well as the maps, to more universal formats. Noesis also possesses plugins to export the character models from KH1 and most of those Final Fantasy games. Also, Govanify and Xeeynamo have made much better KH2 extraction tools. However, ModelViewerWX 0.3 can load KH1 animations, and I haven't seen any other program that can do that.
