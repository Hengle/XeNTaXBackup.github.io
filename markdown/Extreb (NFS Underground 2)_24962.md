Tool for unpacking/packing BIN archives from Need for Speed Underground 2.

It works with ZDIR.BIN / ZZDATA0.BIN / ZZDATA1.BIN / ZZDATA2.BIN / ZZDATA3.BIN files
from PS2 version and possibly XBOX version.

By the way,
program NFS-LangED [https://onedrive.live.com/download?cid= ... W7dGk5tIXY](https://onedrive.live.com/download?cid=1DBDF62BC3C2B05B&resid=1DBDF62BC3C2B05B%21123&authkey=AAukTW7dGk5tIXY)
can be used to translate files File_228.BIN and File_229.BIN after extracting with Extreb.

Somehow I missed that this tool was out. I've tested it on Xbox NFS Underground 1 and 2. You can extract files successfully, but they'll still be in .bin format. You must use extreb l before using extreb e to generate the correct offsets.

this tool never worked for me. every time i try to do extreb l it says:

Need for Speed ZDIR.BIN/ZZDATA*.BIN EXT/REB by HPBURNER

Gathering File Information...

Could not find ZZDATA !

----------

But the exe is in the same folder with zzdata and zdir, i don't know what to do

Script that can be used instead of Extreb --> [http://aluigi.org/bms/nfsu_bun.bms](http://aluigi.org/bms/nfsu_bun.bms)

(I heard that it may work MUCH better for repacking files)
