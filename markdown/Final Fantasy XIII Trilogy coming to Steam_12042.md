- Post Title: Final Fantasy XIII Trilogy coming to Steam

For those who didn't see it yet, the trilogy is coming for the PC, so those who always wanted to play it but they couldn't they can now for a very cheap  prize  (12â‚¬ on europe,  i guess 15 $ on NA more or less, i don't know)

In any case, you can get the first title here: [http://store.steampowered.com/app/292120/](http://store.steampowered.com/app/292120/)

The rest is yet to come i guess.
