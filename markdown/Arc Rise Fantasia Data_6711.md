So I heard that this is the place to come for what I'm looking for.  I have a file that's giving me a great deal of trouble and I was wondering if someone would be nice enough to help me with it?

To the point: [http://www.4shared.com/file/tIDNPBCX/btl_enemy.html](http://www.4shared.com/file/tIDNPBCX/btl_enemy.html)

This is the problem file.  It's in .vld format and I'm not familiar with this whatsoever.  Also a the nice person that referred I come here told me that there are a bunch of L77 compressed Btex files in this and that I would have to separate them, but seeing as I have no idea of how to do that, I am here humbly requesting assistance.   

Also if anyone has already done this and would send me said extracted files that would be a lifesaver.  Ultimately I'm trying to get the .mdl0/texture data from these.

So with this do I just drag and drop the .vld onto the cxd.exe?  I've done so and the command screen is staying up, but the output Vol file doesn't seem to be doing anything as it's staying at 0kb.

Edit:  Nevermind I'm just a tad new to this haha.  It worked like a charm and output a Vol file!

Now my question is how do I access the decompressed contents?  Specifically I'm looking to extract the .mdl0 data.

Well I cracked into the file and all I found in there was animation data and models used for what looked to be attacks in the game.  In the thread you mentioned someone said that this is where the Character/Enemy model data was located so I'm a tad confused. :\
