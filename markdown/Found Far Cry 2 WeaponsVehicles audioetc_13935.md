- Post Title: Found Far Cry 2 Weapons/Vehicles audio/etc

I remember seeing a post a few years back asking where they found, and I just now attempted to find the audios again. Turns out all the audios was in the worlds.dat file, only they're all unnamed. I only got 1300 files, but I got most of the weapon sounds (I think), but didn't bother with vehicle sounds I could post the weapon sounds if anyone wants them really, kinda messy organization though, and not fully finished

I'll probably sort through the audios more to peice things together, still trying to find bits and peices of audio

Sorry for long reply

Found out there's more then just sound binary, of the 130,000 files in unknown, some of them are unnamed audio files, sorting through thougs too (or attempting to)
