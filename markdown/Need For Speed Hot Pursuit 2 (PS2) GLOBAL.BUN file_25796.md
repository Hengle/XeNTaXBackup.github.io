- Post Title: Need For Speed Hot Pursuit 2 (PS2) GLOBAL.BUN file

Hi, I don't have much experience with decrypting files but I used NFS-Disculator to open the ZDIR.BIN and found names of colours in GLOBAL.BUN which is what I was after, however the file is encrypted I'm assuming? So I can't read the values etc, and I was curious if anyone here could help or point me in the right direction? Thanks.

Disculator also shows this when I preview the file:
