- Post Title: Extracting stages from noclip.website?

Is it possible to extract the stages from this site:
[https://noclip.website/](https://noclip.website/)

They have some stages from games that you can't find anywhere else.
I would like to get some of theses stages and make mods out of them but I don't know how to extract them can any one help?
