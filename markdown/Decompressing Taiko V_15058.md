- Post Title: Decompressing Taiko V

Past few months I have toying with files from the Taiko no Tatsujin games series on 3DS, all the files used LZ11 Compression, I have recently turned my eyes to the VITA game Taiko V and having no luck working out what compression it is under, was hoping to find some help here.

From what I can tell looking at various recent Taiko games the files I'm looking at tend to be the same across platforms which could help?

I'm not really sure what is the optimal way to ask for help when it comes to compression so not sure the best information to provide.

I've attached a .zip that contains the following.

VITA/skorpg_e.bin (1.00 KB)
VITA/skorpg_h.bin (1.12 KB)
VITA/skorpg_m.bin (1.37 KB)
VITA/skorpg_n.bin (1.12 KB)
^Compressed VITA Files.

3DS/skorpg_e.bin (800 Bytes)
3DS/skorpg_h.bin (896 Bytes)
3DS/skorpg_m.bin (1.06 KB)
3DS/skorpg_n.bin (864 Bytes)
^Compressed 3DS Files

3DS/Decompressed/skorpg_e.bin (6.50 KB)
3DS/Decompressed/skorpg_h.bin (9.39 KB)
3DS/Decompressed/skorpg_m.bin (12.3 KB)
3DS/Decompressed/skorpg_n.bin (7.30 KB)
^Decompressed 3DS Files, VITA files should look similar to these when decompressed

Finally a few shots of the "skorpg_e.bin" file opened in an HEX Editor under the 2 compressions/decompressed

Hopefully I've provided enough information that someone more knowledgeable than myself can work this out  once we can decompress the files and with any luck recompress it opens up doors for starting work on menu translations and such.
