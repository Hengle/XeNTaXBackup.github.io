- Post Title: FFX - Sin Model

Hey Everyone

This has been a project of mine on and off for a few years now. 

I have been scouring the internet for the most complete/accurate 3d model of sin I can get my hands on and I have been struggling to find an original model. I was wondering if anyone here has managed to find or pull a more complete model from the steam version of the game? or if not, knows the best way to do that (or if its even worth doing so compared to my current findings). 


Here is where I am so far. 
Original:
The only rip I can find of the original is a XNALara version released by Frozen-Knight on deviant art. However the model is quite severely damaged/incomplete. Apparently due to the size of sin, this is actually the most complete version of the model that exists in the asset library (please tell me im wrong).

So I moved onto as accurate pieces of fan art that I could find.


Fan Arts:
First piece of fan art I found was this, a minecraft map made by a Nico Pero.

I figured minecraft maps can be converted into 3d models so in THEORY, I could pull a complete model from this....

With some smoothing filters...I got close, but despite my best efforts I was unable to make the model air tight for printing.


Second piece I found was a fan art piece made by a Mark Hitosis

A very accurate piece and high quality piece (one that Im currently working with) but due to its very organic nature im having trouble working on it to make it more accurate to the game. 


3rd and final piece I found was another fan art piece made by a Sam Yang

However its not as accurate as previous versions and he is a modeller for Blizzard...not someone I could easily reach out to for access to the model. 


But thats it....this is all thats left of the model that I could find. If anyone had any advice or suggestions on the matter, I would greatly appreciate it.

Thank you

EDIT: seem my image links are not working correctly, updating them with raw links.

Noesis supports almost all FF games, You can get the model with it.
