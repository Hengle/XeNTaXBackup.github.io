- Post Title: Spore .package file extension

Hi, I'm translator. I will translate Spore game to Turkish. But I can't open .package files. English files are following:

English file: [http://s7.dosya.tc/server7/32qr00/en-us.rar.html](http://s7.dosya.tc/server7/32qr00/en-us.rar.html)

How am I open this files? Can you suggest extraction program?


Thank you for your help.

You're welcome.
Officially there is no Turkish language.
