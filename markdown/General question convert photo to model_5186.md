Hi, just a general question. 

Do you know of any software that will enble to create models from photographs? For instance, model a characters face by using a picture of someone's face? I've read that this should be possible. Perhaps any of you 3d wizards know of something. 

Cheers, 
Mike

The only software that  I know which can do that is 3D Object modeller,

Hey that Facegen looks like what I need. Thanks all! The other program looks cool, but I do not have this mat and can't model a face in clay first and then make a lot of photos.

Check out the free [LOOXIS Faceworx](http://download.cnet.com/LOOXIS-Faceworx/3000-6677_4-10643644.html) too.

The [source code for Faceworx was donated](http://www.makehuman.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=189) to the [MakeHuman](http://www.makehuman.org/) project but it seems they chose not to use it.
