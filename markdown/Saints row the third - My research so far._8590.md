- Post Title: Saints row the third - My research so far.

Hello Xentax, 

I hope you all are doing good today, so far i have been searching for some good tools to extract data from Saints Row the third. I was successful at finding some tools to extract the textures from the game.

Like here is an example.  



This is the chainsaw texture. Well, i hate to use dx ripper but is there any other ways to extract the meshes/3d models from the game?

Tools i used were Gibbed's tool: [http://svn.gib.me/builds/volition/](http://svn.gib.me/builds/volition/)

SR3 Texture utility: [http://www.saintsrowmods.com/forum/inde ... ities.566/](http://www.saintsrowmods.com/forum/index.php?threads/sr3-texture-utilities.566/)

Are there any research on 3d models i am missing on? i saw a few people actually did mess with the 3d models. If that is so, can someone make a blender importer?

Thanks.
