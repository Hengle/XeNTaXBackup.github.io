- Post Title: Help with Toca 2 touring cars m3d. mesh

Hi,
Can someone please help me with extracting Toca 2 touring cars m3d files?
The files contains the 3d meshes of the cars, and I would like to try to make a "remaster" of the game.
I have a lot of experience of modding Race 07, a sim racing game from 2007.

But Toca 2 was the start of this kind of racing games for a lot of the simracers of today


There is an old tool, Toca2Editor, that can open some of the files and export to .obj, but it can't import as far as I know, and it often crashes when trying to open files.

Regards,

Andreas
