- Post Title: Delete/Add Files

I notice there is a button to do it, but of course its disable so I'm sure it's not done. Is there any ETA when these options will be available, or is it a, per-archive type of process?

It's a per-archive type of process. It depends on wether it is supported by a plugin, or standard MexCom script. 

By definition, MexCom scripts will only enable replacement of files. The script is not written to support deletion. It might be in the future though.  

The delete option can be included if a plugin supports it. A plugin will let MexCom know if it supports deletion. Then MexCom will enable the button and processes required. 

For instance, the Painkiller plugin does support it, while the Sacrifice plugin does not. It thus depends on whoever writes the plugin and how sophisticated the author makes it.
