Apparently, This site says you're Online Right now, and you have no contact details (lol), 

Can you help me Rip Project Diva Motions (and not release it to the public,)

Me and a Friend has The Game Fully Ripped To The Actual Motion Files,

Please add us on skype, I've been editing the Motion files and saw some pretty amazing things,

(P.S ~ We'll send you the 100% Ripped Game)

Looking forward to working with you,

AlphaVocaloid!

(Other people could also help, otoris Example.)

I think the key to getting the animations might lie in this post here.

If we can manage to decrypt these files it will lead to the decryption key needed to obtain the animation files.
