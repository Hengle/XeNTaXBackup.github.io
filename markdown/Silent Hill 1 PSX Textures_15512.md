- Post Title: Silent Hill 1 PSX Textures

Could someone take a look at these textures extracted from Silent Hill? They can be viewed in any program that
supports .TIM files, but it is extremely time-consuming trying to match them with the correct palette. I've uploaded
some textures and additional .IPD files that came with them. There is a set of .IPD's for each texture set.
Maybe they are the palettes?
