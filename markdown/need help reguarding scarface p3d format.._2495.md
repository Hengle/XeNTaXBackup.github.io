- Post Title: need help reguarding scarface p3d format..

hi all. for the past few weeks now i've been tring to find away to read the p3d data in scarface (p.c) i've tried all pluging for 3ds and zmodeler but i havn't found one that can read this type of p3d all i've found is things like this (".p3d" format could be whatever game developers decided. ) but no info on how to decode them to make new modeles for the game i figured out how to repack game data to a point but with being able to open and read these files i can't access any game data. dose anyone here have any ideas about this  type of p3d ? i'll upload a sample and mabe some one will have better luck then i did?
