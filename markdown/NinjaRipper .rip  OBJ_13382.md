- Post Title: NinjaRipper .rip > OBJ

I've created this tool for those who don't have 3dsmax. It's not the best, but it works!

The attached ZIP includes source and binary. Hopefully someone can get some use out of it!

USAGE : rip2obj <filename> -silent 
-silent : Used when you want to skip the "Press ENTER" stages. For use in batch scripts.
