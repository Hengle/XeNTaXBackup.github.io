hello , these times I tried several times to extract file KOF 12 by my self, and as a result I discovered this:
after extract the The king of fighters 12 archive file *.arc thx to chrrox quickbms script....
i extract the *.z format files in the demo folder (exemple:kofxii_fix_rgb.dds.z)with Offzip & Packzip UI that output in to 0000000c.dat, open this last one in DirectX Texture Tool (you will see the image) and then save on *.dds file. i use  DDS Converter to convert the *.dds files to *.bmp,*.jpg,*.png,etc. soooo this is the result [http://img825.imageshack.us/img825/6861 ... fixrgb.png](http://img825.imageshack.us/img825/6861/kofxiifixrgb.png)  

are some other interesting file *.pcs who are in the bg and fighter folders what is expected to be characters and stages textures.
I want to ask experts?will you help ,for how to extracts them? I and some of my friends will be very grateful
