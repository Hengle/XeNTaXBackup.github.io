You could try to export GFX file using hex editor, edit and save it in jpexs decompiller (this tool can edit GFX files when they have right file structure) and then import file to UGX by hex editor. But you have to be careful with GFX file size, it has to be the same as original.

I was wondering if it is possible at all to get files from packages with this file extension and of this type out with this program, or maybe someone know a solution to get it done?
