Can anyone quickly point me to some tools for unpacking UPKs and related files, especially sounds?

I know they're out there, I've searched around yet I've only seen tools for specific games.

...wait, that works for multiple games? Either I'm going blind or just didn't read well enough. 

Anyway, thanks.
