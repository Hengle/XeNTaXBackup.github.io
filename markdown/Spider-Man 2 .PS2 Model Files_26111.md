- Post Title: Spider-Man 2 .PS2 Model Files

After playing this game for the first time this week, iÂ´ve been looking forward to extracting models from it.

I managed to unpack the packed data files ''.PAK'' getting the ''.TM2'' texture files and ''.PS2'' files wich i am 99% positive that are models.

Noesis is able to open those ''.TM2'' textures btw.

With that said, i come wondering if anyone would be willing to create anything to open/convert these models or at least point me to something that does that if it already exists.

I shared samples of 3 characters in the link below, i can share as many more as needed, Thanks for your time.

This game is on XBOX too, check the files of that version. It is more easy to get meshes, I don't know about PS2 format..

I tried to extract spiderman using model researcher, here is my result:

I appreciate the response and the advice, but would you mind telling me what did you use to unpack the .PAK files on the Xbox version?

EDIT: Nevermind that, the same script used for the PS2 files works on it. Thanks again!
