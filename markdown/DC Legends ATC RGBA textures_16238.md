- Post Title: DC Legends ATC RGBA textures

Greetings everyone,i have a problem with a textures from mobile game called "DC Legends"
I tried UnityEX and it said what the Emission map and Specular map are in ATC_RGBA8 format ( [http://i.imgur.com/9I0dRg6.png](http://i.imgur.com/9I0dRg6.png) ), then i tried the Compressonator but it can't save alpha channel properly (which is very bad) so i don't know what to do..
here are my compression settings

Edit: I solved this by using newest version of Unity Studio
