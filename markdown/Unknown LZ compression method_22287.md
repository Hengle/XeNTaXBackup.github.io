- Post Title: Unknown LZ compression method

Hi there, i have been trying to unpack the files of a Wii game called "dekotora matsuri", problem is that i haven been able to find any decompression method that works with it, from the xentax discord i head that it looked like some kind of LZ compression method, though none of the ones i have tried to unpack work with it, i also have a decompressed version exported from the RAM, problem is that the game has like 7 gbs in assets and not all get decompressed at once plus it gets all jumbled in RAM, so if anyone could help me with the format id be grateful!
