Hi there.

I am trying to get the audio from this fsb (or .xen)
I'm unable to find the key for it, could anyone help me with finding the key?

the link to them is right [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/14EXIDG_YiQQQtt2DB9bFVxL-lB1_mhBi/view?usp=sharing)

Not only that link is private and cant be downloaded it seems.
How do you know its even encrypted?
The only cryptic about this whole thing is it's description, why?
What Game?
What platform?
etc

Oh oops. I forgot to make the link public.

It's from the game Guitar Hero Metallica on the Xbox 360.
While looking through the files I found a couple of other fsbs that are encrypted, I know they're encrypted because I can convert normal fsbs I get from the files perfectly fine with the tools. Just these couple are encrypted. Which is also noticeable when putting it in a hex editor.

If the link doesn't work try [this](https://drive.google.com/file/d/14EXIDG_YiQQQtt2DB9bFVxL-lB1_mhBi/view?usp=sharing)

This is the encrypted fsb in the hex editor


and this is a fsb that I'm able to convert perfectly fine in the hex editor

I don't know what is wrong with those samples to be honest, PS3 version seems to work fine though.
What tools are you using?

I am using a mix of "FsbDecrypt" (A jar file that I've found some time ago) and towav

I've also tried the PS3 version and I couldn't get it to work either. Which tools are you using for that?

guessfsb03

after that use foobar2000/vgmstream for proper decoding NOT towav

I don't know how to use guessfsb03. And I didn't know foobar and vgmstream had the ability to properly decode it.

I'll have a look at it. Thanks for "trying" to help me

Trying? Really?
Cant you just "try" to read the readme.txt then?
Or its that difficult?
