- Post Title: Ultraman - Fighting Evolution (Jp) PS1- 3D models

Hello everyone. I would like to know if it is possible to extract the 3d models from this game. I have better models, but I want to own these as well. I really appreciate the old graphics and I make and assemble some papercrafts using these models. Thank you very much!
