- Post Title: [MH4U] 3DS .tex files and MH3U WII U .tex files

I'm trying to convert these MH4U .tex files to a image format. But I don't know how.
 See I don't know how to use python scripts or ARCtool. 
I've tried neosis script it doesn't work. 

Also I got mh3U WII U .tex files I also want converted, I used neosis but it doesn't work with every .tex file. 
I'll attach the not working file.
