- Post Title: [PS3] putting back together .SFD files (Yakuza Kenzan)

Hello.

I wanted to make a mod for myself where I can hardcode subs from an English translation guide from Youtube into the games cutscenes files. I can demux them and edit the .m2v just fine, but I can't seem to find any info on how to actually put it and it's .aix audio file back into an .SFD. Every tool I can find is for MPEG1 .SFDs only, not MPEG2.

You need a newer CRIWARE sofdec tools (most of the known tools were intended for creating Dreamcast's SFD file).
There's a pack of leaked CRIWARE SDKs that contain those tools however I can't link it here as it potentially against the forum rules, but a google search should help you to find it.
What you needed is the ones that supports MPEG-2's and AIX.
