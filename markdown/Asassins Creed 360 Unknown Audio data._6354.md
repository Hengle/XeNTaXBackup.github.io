- Post Title: Asassins Creed 360 Unknown Audio data.

I was wondering if anyone could help me figure out what audio format this is? the 360 version of creed is supose to use xma which it does but on some tracks it doesn't have the regular xma starting stream and flag? Is it some special ubisoft packaging?
