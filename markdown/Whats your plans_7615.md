I love it. Another day out of the year to meet family and friends, and eat a lot.

I always say, if there's ever a time to relentlessly shovel dead turkey meat into your face, it's definitely when you're celebrating the successful theft of your land and the unapologetic murder, rape, and betrayal of thousands of the land's native inhabitants. At least that's what I like to focus on as the turkey, now having as much life in it as the hundreds of babies our ancestors starved and murdered, is ground and gnashed between my teeth. God Bless America.

(yeah I'll probably have some turkey dinner with the relatives)

Well, yes, that is the reason we as pacified and utterly civilized Europeans do not celebrate such crimes against humanity. Instead, we say FUCK YOU PAPANDREOU, and celebrate the invention of Apartheid by the Dutch and the Spanish Inquisition by the er.. Spanish. Nothing like a good witch hunt. Today, we have labeled the heretics "muslims" and the Inquistition is well under way.  Well .. we? I - as atheist - steer clear of that. I'm just interested in the imminent release of Skyrim, thank you. (Oh and yesterday the game Amnesia suberged me into pure evilness, it was like a warm creepy blanket, you should try it).

It's weird, a bunch of people I know are suddenly playing Amnesia. I was considering it however many months back when it first came out, but I never got around to it. It's been getting a lot of praise lately from people whose opinions I generally trust, though, so I think I'm going to finally go back and try it. Once I have access to a good desktop PC again.

I've noticed the same thing. I got a copy of Amnesia as part of the Humble Bundle it was part of (I've been making a point of buying every single one of them as they come out), but haven't played it myself either. =/

That you notice it now might have something to do with the sale at Steam, I got it for 3 euros. A bargain.
