- Post Title: Files CPK0 Megaman X Hunter PSP

Hello friends, how are you...
I have a question regarding the CPK0 file Megaman X PSP
I saw that the texts are with LZ compression, BMS has some scripts that 
extracts the contents of CPK0, however, they are within the .dat file.
How can I extract the files CPK0 of .DAT?
I tried manually by hex, but it did not work.

Can someone please help me.
