- Post Title: Can't extract uasset audio files?

Hi all, I have close to no idea what I'm doing when it comes to this so I apologize if my questions come off as amateurish, but searching around didn't net me any successful solutions, so this is sort of a last ditch attempt.

I've been trying unsuccessfully to extract Caligula Overdose's audio files through various means, but to no avail. Most people seem to point to umodel, so I've been fiddling with that, but even though I have the sound files box ticked and have even located the exact files that need to be extracted, I always get "0/0 files exported."
