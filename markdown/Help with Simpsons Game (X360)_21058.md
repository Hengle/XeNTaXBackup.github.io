- Post Title: Help with Simpsons Game (X360)

Hello all, fairly new to modding. Was wondering if I could get some help with extracting textures from The Simpsons Game (X360 Version). I've read up and down on the forums and other places on the internet for help but due to my inexperience I'm still stuck.

I am able to extract .str's using the QuickBMS script that can be found on QuickBMS's website, and there I was able to find a folder in all .str's called "Texture Dictionary" which within it contains one or more files that are .itxd. Not .txd, but .itxd.

I heard about NOESIS and using its .py script, but I couldn't get the script to working.

Essentially, I'm a noob, gib help.

Here's a Noesis plugin that supports Xbox 360 .ITXDs.
