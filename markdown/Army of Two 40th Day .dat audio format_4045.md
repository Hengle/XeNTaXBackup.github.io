Assuming that these are the same files I dealt with [here](http://hcs64.com/mboard/forum.php?showthread=17929), [ww2ogg](http://hcs64.com/vgm_ripping.html) should handle them.  Note that some won't convert without the --inline-codebooks switch, I understand that these are from multiplayer.

Yes these are the WWise audio codecs, use hcs's tool, problem is the music has such a crap stream system that its difficult to tell which segments need combining.
