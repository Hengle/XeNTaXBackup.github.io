Does anyone know how to unpack .str files from 007 From Russia With Love Xbox, Deadspace 2 Xbox 360, Deadspace 3 Xbox 360, Goblet of Fire Gamecube or The Godfather Xbox?

Samples are here

I tried both dead_space_3.bms and simpsons_str.bms on all these files with no luck.

I second this, so many threads about classic Bond games over the years but only the latest CoD or "hot trend" gets cracked in a matter of days or weeks. Really wish someone would take a look at older classics like these and work with them...

For Bond and godfather *.str files it's a modified RenderWare stream containers.
