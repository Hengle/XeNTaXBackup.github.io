- Post Title: [PS2] Sengoku Basara 2 Heroes 3D Model Extraction [Help]

Greetings all. 

I need help for open few file format inside .Afs file (after extract from .Iso)

I wanted to get 3D Model and Texture in game. Yes i do with ninja ripper and other ripping software. But it's only showing full black texture and very a lot things to do. And i can't get normal .Obj like i wanted 

Yes i do. I try a lot script with quickbms. But nothing happen even the extensions file name is same.

Yes i do II. Also i already try with hex editor like HXD. But i can't get anything. 

I think if we can extract/convert the file maybe we can get better mesh and texture.

Any help is really appreciated. Thanks

:this is sample file from this iso game:
