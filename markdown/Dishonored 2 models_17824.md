Dishonored 2 models tool

Usage: drop .bmd6model onto the tool.

If model file has a skeleton name needed for it, tool will search for that skeleton in current directory.
If not, you need to specify skeleton name as second parameter. 
(Example: Dis2model.exe model.bmd6model base_female.md6skl)
Or select skeleton file, then model file, and drop them both onto the tool.

just I think skeleton file's extension is "edgeskl" , not "md6skl", change extesion the tool work great.

I understood that , you don’t need to change that.
I just thought most people like me used the quickbms script unpack game packs [http://aluigi.altervista.org/bms/dishonored2.bms](http://aluigi.altervista.org/bms/dishonored2.bms)
but I couldn't found  "md6skl" files , that confused me a while. 
then I found "edgeskl" files , change it's extension , then work.
so I writed those  to tried help someone like me.  

And I think inside "md6.decl" files have files's original name, we can check it.

Does the utility work only with Death of the Outsider or standard Dishonored 2 too?
