- Post Title: Loss from resource theft

How much do developers or publishers lose if their resources were to be extracted and used by general people in general projects?

For example, Square and Tecmo probably get all of their models "stolen" and used in all sorts of projects.
For the consumers, we're typically happy to be able to use them, and don't really think about the victims.

There's not any loss when the game is released and people find their way into the files. Real loss occurs when someone steals a harddrive or something like that that contains a project that hasn't been released yet. At that time, all ideas behind the game are exposed and the company risks losing something if the thief uses that info to release something similar.
