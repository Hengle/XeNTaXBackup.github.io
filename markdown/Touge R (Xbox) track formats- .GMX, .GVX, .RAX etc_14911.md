The course folder is structured like this:



I can only assume the col folder is for collision, as every track is included in a .col ranging from 1-2MB. Therefore I've uploaded one sample track (akagi_a_1p) with this included. [Link](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B9U7HRzRbo3HVXR0czBwbXNPLTQ)

Thanks

Sorry, this post was poorly written late at night with not much attention to what exists (question was just 'can these be extracted, whether they're compressed etc'), I'll go through the tutorial and apply it to the rest of the tracks, even if I'm slow to understand things (for various reasons) which led me to coming here. Thread can be deleted.
