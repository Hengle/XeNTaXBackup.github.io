- Post Title: NFS Carbon TEXTURES.BIN Extraction

Hello again.

Now I'm looking for the textures that get applied to the police vehicles in NFSC. I came upon a file called TEXTURES.BIN but I do not know how to open a .BIN since it's basically a binary file. Looking at the header looks like random nonsense, so it might be headerless. I've tried quickBMS with some .BIN scripts as well as NOESIS. Nothing. I'm stuck. Any advice?

P.S: If you extract them yourself for me, that would be helpful, too, but I'd prefer a method on how to extract the rest of them I plan on using.
