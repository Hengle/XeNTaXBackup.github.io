- Post Title: Rayman 2 *.dsb files

Hey there!

I'm looking to decompress (and recompress) the *.dsb files found in the PC version of Rayman 2, but I haven't been able to figure out the compression format yet.

I suspect these are compressed versions of the *.dsc files used in Tonic Trouble (which used the same engine), which were long text files that basically listed all of the resources and extra files the game should look for. Modifying the main *.dsc file (Game.dsc - Rayman 2's corresponding *.dsb file is also included in the attached zip) made it possible to change the first level, skip the main menu, modify and add cheats, and even activate debug mode. It will be interesting to see this done with Rayman 2!

Here are some examples:
