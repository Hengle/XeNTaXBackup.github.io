Here is the model, the vertexes are in 32byte arrays with the first 6bytes being 2bytesignedvertexes.
The number of vertexes is located at offset "C"
After the vertexes are 2ByteInteger Tristrips.
Do you want me to be more specific, or not as you said it is the same format as DMC4, which I do not know much about.
