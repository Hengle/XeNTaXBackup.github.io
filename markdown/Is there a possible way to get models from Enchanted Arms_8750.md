- Post Title: Is there a possible way to get models from Enchanted Arms???

Xbox 360 game.

I readed time ago, about one user who said he could rip stuff from Enchanted Arms (Xbox 360)
but even with Noesis I couldn't manage to rip the stuff.

I could get the files from the ISO, and found out that the character models are BMD format.
the problem is that I can't read those files. just received an error message saying.
"File could not be previewed."   

is there a way to preview the models? Any Plug-in that supports the files? how can I export the model files?

thanks in advance... and sorry for asking something noobish.
