And you can find documentation for this file format here

Does anyone know if this format contains filenames anywhere or how the game deals with that?
The files I have don't appear to contain any filenames that I can see.

As far as I know, there are no filenames inside.

Is anyone aware of any other games (especially on platforms other than PS3 and even more especially anything on PC) that used this AST BGFA format?
