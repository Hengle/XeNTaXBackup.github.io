- Post Title: Metin2 Granny SDK

Hello @ all.

I'am trying now over 2 or 3 weeks to get my own Animations into the Game "Metin2".

But i heared that i need the Granny SDK 2.4.0.7 to 2.5.0.5 or so.
I used google, but i didn't found anything. Only the 2.6.0.10 SDK and so i wanted to ask here, if somebody has an Granny SDK 2.4.0.7 to 2.5.0.5 ?

I really need it. 
Thank you very much.

Kind Regards.
