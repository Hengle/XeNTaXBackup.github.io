Hi guys, seen my nephew play "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Mutants in Manhattan" pretty fun, not the best game but..

[http://www.tmntmutantsinmanhattan.com/](http://www.tmntmutantsinmanhattan.com/)

Packed files are .cpk, can be extracted using [http://dbxvmods.freeforums.net/thread/3 ... ack-repack](http://dbxvmods.freeforums.net/thread/3/cpk-unpack-repack)

At a first glance:
the .dtt files are the textures
the .dat files are the models.

More soon I hope.

.dtt are indeed the textures, some have multiple texture I think, 

cut of the first 96 bytes and you have your dds texture

I have every single file from this game extracted and able to convert if anyone needs as well from Rooftop Run. I also have all the files extracted from Danger Of The Ooze but no idea how to open them past their native format.
