- Post Title: The Sims 3 .package File

Since the FullBuild1.package file is where the music is stored for the PC version, I'm assuming it's again stored in this file for the Xbox 360 version.

However I can't seem to locate the music within the file.

Here's the first 10MB

EDIT: I have tried opening the package file with the same tool I use to open the package files for the PC version (S3PE) but to no avail.

Maybe it has something to do with endianess or w/e. Since the 360 runs under a big-endian architecture then I assume that might be the culprit.

I'm not exactly sure how to change it from small to big endian using Hex Workshop.

Well, that's not possible. You'll have to write your own program. But oh well, let me take a look at the whole game and I'll get back to you again. The files are EAlayer3 by the way.
