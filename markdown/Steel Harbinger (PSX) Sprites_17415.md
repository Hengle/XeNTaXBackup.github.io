- Post Title: Steel Harbinger (PSX) Sprites

Hi guys, I need help figuring out how to decompress Steel Harbinger's .SHP files. They seem to contain compressed graphics, and take the palette from .COL files. I've attached a link to a .SHP and a .COL, would be great if someone can take a look.

 .COL : [https://drive.google.com/open?id=1a6zIE ... ljCXCAQcHn](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1a6zIEThYtj7s2YcOdDC4KpljCXCAQcHn)

.SHP : [https://drive.google.com/open?id=1E5F-T ... cx72qN52E8](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1E5F-TzVmpELEktbJh0Te9ocx72qN52E8)
