there was a download, check if this one works:

[http://patch.vaanonline.co.kr/kamuse/la ... oad_nw.exe](http://patch.vaanonline.co.kr/kamuse/launcher/VaanDownload_nw.exe)

says patch, maybe because it's already installed on my comp. Hope it works for you. You can get my login for pmang on pm if you want

LOL turns out the game is only available at certain times of the day and I can't download it until then or something.
