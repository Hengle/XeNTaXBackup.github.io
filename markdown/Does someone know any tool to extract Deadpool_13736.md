Hi, there is tool for Transformers: War of Cybertron, but it works with Deadpool - I am translating tha game already and I had no problem so far.
Of course, it is not my tool, I found it on the internet.

Hello.
I try this file, and it works good with Coalesced.int, but crash with Coalesced.rus.
Please help, to extract and repack data from file Coalesced.rus.
I try to change localization, because existing localization is too bad.
Tnx any help!
