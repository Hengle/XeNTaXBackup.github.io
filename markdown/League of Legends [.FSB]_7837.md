- Post Title: League of Legends [.FSB]

I've been trying to unpack this FSB file, but nothing i've tried so far works. 
I've tried the latest fsbext and kksunpacker, if there is anything else, please tell me   

The .fsb is called VOBank_en_US.fsb in League of Legends. I can give a download link if you'd like.
