- Post Title: .TBD archive format (Metal Fatigue) - a challenge?

Hi there!

I have found much pleasure in the game called "Metal Fatigue" made by Psygnosis a while ago (which doesnt exist anymore) - I would like to mod/explore this game's mechanics.

This game uses an archive file format name .TBD
This format is probably encrypted (dont know)
This format is not used in any of their other games.
These .tbd archives probably contain textures/sounds/model files

The .tbd file format header is as follows:

```
RIFF   TBDFTYPE
```


The following file contains examples of this archive type:

I would appreciate it if somebody could look into this format!

Thanks,

I had a look at the format a while ago but couldn't find out very much.
At least some archives seem to contain only a single file.

So nobody knows how this format works?

Hmm, I had a look, it seems that the files where written in some sort of algorithom, ex an encryption. If you could provide the executable then I could further research it.

Ah I remember, it was that strange format having a structure similar to wav.

But they aren't encrypted, just have a look at the strings.tbd. I uploaded some more sample files.

Nevertheless, here's the exe:

Sweet, I'll take a look in ASM later.

Well I had a look but its tied in really deep. Sorry, I did see some basic things you can edit. You could also try editing sections and finding the result in-game.

So theres no hope in swapping textures in some of these files?

Thanks for taking a look! ... Is there anyone else that could maybe crack this?

Im sure there is but finding them and getting then to help might not be easy.

Have anyone attempted to unpack this file format yet?

Couple of years later im still attempting to crack this one

i admire your persistence!


edit
found an old beta for the missing dll.

the header is read as 12 bytes [expecting "LIST" or "RIFF" as the signature | followed by remaining size |  followed by "TBDF"]
looks for these segments (in order): TYPE, IMPT, EXPT, OFFS, DATA
segment signatures are followed by their size, and segments are read in 16kb chunks or less.

now there is indeed a hashtable - but im fairly sure the demo is different from the release

Thanks for the infoz, however... ive found an app called RIFF viewer which can read the contents of the tags you mentioned. However, the problem with these files that I can extract from the .TBD's dont have file headers, so you dont really know what type of files they are.

Ive got this far: I can extract sounds from the game from sounds.tbd with this little app I wrote:

SoundTBD_Unpacker - [http://filebeam.com/1e27ca4819fbe9f50c7b90812eec51a4](http://filebeam.com/1e27ca4819fbe9f50c7b90812eec51a4)

Above link includes the sound.tbd file and sources.

Now my main problem is the fact that I can establish exactly HOW images or models etc is stored in these files... there must be some structure of how the game reads these "DATA" blocks in the tbd files. The sound files are simply RIFF WAVE sound files stacked one after the other in the tbd files, uncompressed, unencrypted.

Thanks again WRS for investigating. 
Do any of you have any idea/method of discovering how of what structure the DATA blocks are read by the game?

Do I need to provide more .TBD files? Certain DLL's? EXE's ?

Thanks!

- Post Title: Re: .TBD archive format (Metal Fatigue) - a challenge?

the sections have different structures:

TYPE
uint FileCount
for each FileCount: uint LookupHash, uint DataPointer


the lookup hash is checked from a list (??) from pSymbolTable
plaintext files may not be listed here (eg. sound.tbd)

IMPT (expecting EXPT  to be the same)
uint FileCount
for each FileCount: uint ??, uint ??

OFFS  you have..
uint FileCount
for each FileCount: uint DataPointer

DATA

variable.
master.tbd (the filelist, and loaded first) contains strings with no defined lengths
others like sound.tbd have the size of the data before

Hey there!  Found this forum while searching for a way to extract the models from Metal Fatigue.  

In my wonderings of the net I found the following information that I hope might be useful to this endeavor.   According to an interview with Jason Hough of Zono found here [http://www.firingsquad.com/games/metalf ... /page3.asp](http://www.firingsquad.com/games/metalfatigueshots/page3.asp), the texture maps are drawn in photoshop, and the models and animation was done with Lightwave 3d.

Now adding on to that...a small co-op has an application they claim can partially read the archives of Metal fatigue.  Their website and the app are found here...[http://www.watto.org/extract/info.html](http://www.watto.org/extract/info.html).

Now I have yet to try this utility myself as I am at work, but I will try it as soon as I can.  However if their utility can at least partially read the archives, perhaps that will give a direction to move in.  I'm hoping I can find the 3d meshes of the combot parts, cause if I can, I can build them into foldable cardstock models.

Cheers!
