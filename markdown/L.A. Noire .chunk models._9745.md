- Post Title: L.A. Noire .chunk models.

I know that some of you guys have already converted stuff from the game, but I was wondering if the .chunk models can be worked on, and if it's easy enough to churn out custom models to be imported back to Noire. I'd like to, like, do some fixes to the game, i.e. replace the Airflow with a more accurate version (the 1934 Airflow ingame looked a tad too disproportionate afaik - rear doors look too long and there's no corner window near the rear windows), and correct some bugs that Bondi left in it.

I have the legit game with me, so if anyone wants some samples for analysis, please let me know.

for what it's worth, i'm supporting this request. the game has a lot of modding potential, model wise.

I won't mind if the peds can't be replaced (being that Bondi used complex facial mocap), but I'll vouch on someone who can reverse-engineer the .chunk format for vehicles and weapons.

once you crack the chunk, you should be able to do simple things immediately like replacing simply rigged clothes items such as hats. i've already found numerous chunk files related to the clothing. they're broken into many pieces

Seems legit. Who's up for a hipster/gangsta Cole mod?   

Again if anyone wants some chunks for analysis, I'd be glad to help. Mr. Mouse won't allow me to share assets publicly for copyright/piracy reasons, so a PM or two will suffice.

And MMORPGs too. No offense but personally I find them just as cliche as COD. I mean, take two or three letters, and then append the word online to it like XYZ Online or something like that, and you'll end up with the same generic fantasy premise.
