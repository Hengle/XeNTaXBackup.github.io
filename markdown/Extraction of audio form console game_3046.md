Not a clue.  PC games should be relatively easy as most games just have compressed archives of the sound files.  There are a few games who compress and use proprietary audio formats though, for example Warhammer 40k Dawn of war uses a proprietary audio format, but games like that have command line apps floating around on the net that you can get to convert them to standard audio formats.

PAM files are videos. They are a combination of MPEG video and ATRAC3(plus?) audio and is the main video format for PS3 games (if devs feel like using it, otherwise they use something else like SFD for example). SGH/SGB files are sound files for PS3 games. Their formats can vary from PS ADPCM to something else. The SGH files are the headers and SGBs are the body data.
