So the latest closed beta test for MHO started recently, and I got a hold of the client files, however the archives are different from previous betas/the benchmark and so the current tool for it cannot unpack them. 

I've uploaded an example for anyone interested to take a look, though the archives are encrypted, the files inside should still be standard Cryengine stuff like the past betas/the benchmark.

[Edit: Link seems to have died, PM for link to archive if you are still interested since I'm pretty sure I know who's reponsible]
