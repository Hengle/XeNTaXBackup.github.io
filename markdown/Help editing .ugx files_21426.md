- Post Title: Help editing .ugx files

Hi,

I was wondering if someone could help me out here.

I'm trying to edit the Character Creation screen from Lineage 2. Scripts and graphic files are locked inside a .ugx file. I was told that it's a standard Unreal package.

I know how to decompile that pack into .GFxFlash files. I don't know how to edit them properly. Most importantly, I have no idea how to compile them back into a .ugx package.

Drop ui4.ugx onto extract.exe to unpack it. Or drop it onto mxencdec.exe to decode it.

I can use 'JPEXS Free Flash Decompiler' to view the files but I cannot save any changes.

Has anyone got any experience in dealing with such files?
