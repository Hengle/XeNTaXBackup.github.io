- Post Title: .VFF Grey Scale bitmap

Hello, first off this is my first post. So let me take a minutes to breath and smack myself for asking for help.

Anyways, I've been working on an old computer game recently, Emergency: Fighters for life, and I'm trying to sucsessfully edit the textures. I was semi hopeful that this was a SUN Microsystems format and could be opened up and edited. But XnView chewed it and spit it out saying the file format wasn't supported. The files are too old to be any sort of cache file (I assume). Anywho, I am really hoping for some help, has anyone got an editor they'd wish to share?
