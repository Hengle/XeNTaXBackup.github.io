Hi! I'm very new here, and I have very little experience in ripping 3D models (I have a little in ripping sprites. but that's about it).

I've been attempting to rip the 3D models from the PS1 game Getter Robo Daikessen (I do love me some super robots). I know there's no standardized procedure to do this, so I've gone through all the steps I could find online.

Daikessen doesn't play well with PSXPrev- only a mostly blank model with a bar(?) can be extracted from the game's iso file, along with about 10 or so blank Croc models. So I decided to try out the no$ps1 path (explained here: [https://www.vg-resource.com/thread-3658 ... #pid657754](https://www.vg-resource.com/thread-36585-post-657754.html#pid657754)), which, if I understand this correctly, involves using no$psx's built in VRAM viewer to locate each tri and quad's coordinates inside the iso file through a hex editor. Problem is, I can't find any results inside the hex'ed up iso file, which I believe is because of some sort of mesh compression. I've attempted to research PS1 mesh compression but I've found no results; so I've sort of hit a brick wall. 

Would anyone else with a little more knowledge than me kindly point me in the right direction? Thank you!
