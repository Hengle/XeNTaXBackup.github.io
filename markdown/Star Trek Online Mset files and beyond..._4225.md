Heya,

I'm trying to extract some of the models from the game as well.  I've extracted all the bins and now I'm left with .mset files and no idea how to view them.

Did you make any progress with this?

Any assistance would be appreciated.

Nick

Any hope of getting this to work?

Does anyone know a way to directly capture models from the game client?

Sorry for the necro post but ive made a development with 3dripperDX, if you enter this command line in 3dripperDX while trying to run the Live servers GameClient.exe you will be able to log into the game and rip 3D from the game. (The Locale can be changed for what ever country you are in)

```
-Locale English -server 208.95.184.38 -server 208.95.184.42 -server 208.95.184.192 -server 208.95.184.129 -server 208.95.184.129 -server 208.95.184.43 -LoginServerShardIPAndPort Holodeck 208.95.184.38 7422 -LoginServerShardIPAndPort Holodeck 208.95.184.30 7001 -LoginServerShardIPAndPort Holodeck 208.95.184.42 7422 -LoginServerShardIPAndPort Holodeck 208.95.184.42 7001 -LoginServerShardIPAndPort Holodeck 208.95.184.192 7422 -LoginServerShardIPAndPort Holodeck 208.95.184.192 7001 -LoginServerShardIPAndPort Holodeck 208.95.184.129 7422 -LoginServerShardIPAndPort Holodeck 208.95.184.129 7001 -LoginServerShardIPAndPort Holodeck 208.95.184.43 7422 -LoginServerShardIPAndPort Holodeck 208.95.184.43 7001 -console
```

Here's an example of something I've been able to rip from STO (rendered in 3ds max 2012):

hope this helps you all out

This doesn't seem to work anymore, as far as I know 3D Ripper DX works only on 32 Bit applications but I don't think STO is 32 bit anymore, it gives me an error when attempting to launch the GameClient.exe now.

Ninja Ripper supports 64 bit applications and the same command line should work in theory, however, Cryptic made changes to the engine that for some reason now garbles all UVW data on ripped meshes, so you're best bet is dumping the .mset's and converting them to obj using the gibbed.crypticstudios tools. Those tools should show up with a quick google search.
