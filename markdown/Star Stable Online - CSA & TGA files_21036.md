- Post Title: Star Stable Online - CSA & TGA files

I apologize if this is in the wrong thread or isn't considered ok for this forum.

I recently discovered a thread dedicated to ripping files from the Star Stable games a while back on another resource board. The thread was basically necro at that point but now I am curious. I have been trying to access the files for the MMO Star Stable Online to look at the textures of the models close-up. I was able to view them just fine for a while until a recent update had the files packed into 12 .CSA files for the data. I have tried asking others who have managed to get into the files for assistance but for some reason none will respond.

I am a complete noob when it comes to programming so maybe this is waaaaay out of my league and i should learn at least some basic programming first but i wanted to take a shot in asking this forum for some assistance or to point me in the right direction to learn how to do it myself. 
Here is the original quote btw.

So i need to build a packer, but maybe i'm not using the right google searches cuz i can't find anything directly focused at what i'm looking for i guess?
Any help would be appreciated. I really do want to learn how this all works.

How do you exploit the game? Can you walk me through it? I want to be able to run the game offline.

There is one game I need to get files. All data files is in csa.
I can't easily open it... Most of people told me to decompile a game, not sure how to do it.
Is there any other way to open these files?

Not sure if it's good place to talk about my problem again. So sorry for the problems
I had to extract some files from the game and I already have them but there is one thing to do.
When I open most of files are encrypted and I can't open them. I need to build a packer and not sure how to do it or it's even possible to do it. I know I need programming language like JAVA or HxD... I'm not sure what to do now. Any ideas? Thx for help!

You need to be more specific. Tell us what game is it, what are these files,
upload some samples for us to look and describe what methods and tools you have already tried.

Besides, writing packer is the last thing to do.
First you need to figure out file format and encryption method, write a unpacker (or tool for decryption), test some minor changes etc.

Any tutorial on how to deal with this stuff can be found here [viewtopic.php?f=29&t=22266](https://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=29&t=22266)

I used Quickbms to take files from the game.
Files were hidden in csa and csaheader formats. I already have files from the game called Star Stable Online. I need mostly textures and models but when I convert all of them and I still can't open them.

Ok, but you still haven't uploaded any samples yet.

For more complex encryptions, you need to use debugger
to reverse engineer decryption methods (see tutorials section for more details).

P.S. I have merged your topics.

And also, I used Quickbms to convert files and then it said it doesn't work or an error. I tried to open with File Magic but it didn't work too. So I think this is the last what I have to do is encryption

Hello. I have made some progress regarding encrypted TGA files.

The most important news is that the game has debug symbols in the newest 
2.6.0 release, so debugging may be easier from now on.

I was also able to partially figure out file format which can be found on the wiki
[http://wiki.xentax.com/index.php/Star_Stable_Online_TGA](http://wiki.xentax.com/index.php/Star_Stable_Online_TGA)

It seems that SSO developers have used some functions from crunch library
[https://github.com/BinomialLLC/crunch](https://github.com/BinomialLLC/crunch)
so the code there may be used to match types/names from game code.
Here is the package with crunch executables
[https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zrXWHn ... sp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zrXWHne6YQyb7NC6psSsDAyQHQQ2o1JE/view?usp=sharing)


And here is the instruction on how to proceed to get converted textures (but still encrypted though):
1. Register at starstable.com and download installer (v2.6.0 or newer)
2. Login to game (game will download CSA and CSAHEADER files at first launch)
3. Use this script [https://aluigi.altervista.org/bms/star_ ... online.bms](https://aluigi.altervista.org/bms/star_stable_online.bms) 
with quickbms to unpack CSA archives.
4. Delete 25 bytes from the beginning of TGA file and change extension to CRN
5. Use crunch on CRN file like this
     
```
crunch.exe -file  <CRN_FILE>
```

6. crunch will output DDS file which is still unreadable unfortunately,
  but I hope that someone else will be able to crack this

I'm copying my message here:

Hello! I modified the bms file (I wrote 1 instead of 0 Xd) and with this star stable online bms, quickbms will extract the pte, pmt and more sso files.

I'll send the new bms (I only tried with the csaheader files, but unpacked the same as the csa actually):
[https://drive.google.com/file/d/16f9qMSo...sp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/16f9qMSo...sp=sharing)
And I'm sending one pte file from the folder :

[https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qhrk3mU...sp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qhrk3mU...sp=sharing)

...And you can open the pme files!

You can't because they're still encrypted. For now we don't know how to decrypt them.

Because they're encrypted. If you want to open them you need to use crunch. Sadly after using crunch they're still encrypted, but now you can open them. We're still trying to figure out how to decrypt them.

As I said you need to use crunch. It will still be encrypted but you'll be able to open it. Some of the old textures can be opened without crunch, but you need open them in hex editor (HxD), remove everything up until the beginning of the "DDS" word, and rename the extension to .dds, or open them in 3d Object Converter, and convert to .dds (you can also open .pme files in it).

4. Delete everything from the beginning to the beginning of "Hx" word, and change extension to .crn
5. Move the .crn file on the crunch file, or move the crunch file on the .crn file. 
6. crunch will output DDS file. You'll be able to open it, but it will be "pixelated". 

You can download crunch.exe from here: [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zrXWHn ... sp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zrXWHne6YQyb7NC6psSsDAyQHQQ2o1JE/view?usp=sharing)

You just need to change extension to .crn. For example save it as "name.crn" instead of "name.pte".

You was supposed to move .crn file to the crunch.exe. (you can also use microsoft powershell for this if you know how to use it)

Hi! So i got to the point where I got the files now, but didn't get crunch to work. I have some .pme files, but most are still .pte and .pmt . Crunch didn't work, or atleast the one that was linked here. Any tips?

Can you tell me what isn't working and with more details? It would also help a lot if you send me a video what are you doing so I can help you.
I also said before that files are still encrypted so even after using crunch you will see bunch of pixels instead of a texture. If you're talking about this then sorry I can't help you.

I also can't use the crunch but so far there is no one who knows to help us

I tried to help you before. If you still need help message me on private messages. Tell me what you're doing or send me a video so I can help you.

Hi! So I've actually been on top of this a few days now. I've got things to work. But I can promise you the the files are not encrypted. I've been in contact with many people who have actually done this. I got crunch to work, but it's not the file that's linked here. You have to download it from the original github, and after that you need a little bit of cmd knowledge, to get things through crunch. Only thing I can say is that the information is already here in this thread. It's not that hard in the end.

Okay, so I have a tiny problem. I have .DDS files that have been compressed using DXT1. Does anyone have any idea how to get these open?

A little bit background info:

So the original format was .pte and that format is not being used by any other game so far. They use crunch compression to compress the files, so the first thing of course is to take hex, remove the header and then run the .crn file through crunch. Crunch outputs a .DDS file that is compressed using DXT1. We can open the .DDS file, but It's "pixelated". I've added pictures so that you can understand this a little better.

Some say that these files are encrypted, but I've been in contact with a few people who actually have done this and they confirmed that they aren't encrypted. Of course modding is wrong in some cases, so they don't want to tell everything, but we want these purely for creative purposes and giving feedback to the game devs. I don't even know if this is right what I'm asking, but have been stuck with this problem for a while now.

Thank in advance for the information provided!

guys!!

i managed to decrypt some of the encrypted texture files, and then i turned them into .dds images so programs like GIMP and noesis can now open them normally.

proof image:
https://ibb.co/TmKwwgC

you can download the texture for the white gen 2 friesian here:

https://drive.google.com/file/d/1B3Rj_K ... sp=sharing

also, does anyone know how to get the 3d models (.pme) into blender or any other program like it? the only thing that opens them for me is 3d object converter but it's kind of useless.

You can export .pme models to blender models using 3d object converter, but you need to buy registration, otherwise exported models will have every 5th polygon or triangle removed. 
Also can you describe how you managed to decrypt encrypted textures?

Hi
If you used good QuickBMS script, models should be in a .pme format. If you want to change their format, or open them, use 3d Object Converter. Textures should be in .pte format. You cant open them without using crunch. Sadly, even if you use crunch, textures will be pixelated. For now we dont have any method to decrypt them.

I think someone who already decrypted the textures used crunch and this -> [https://github.com/hglm/texgenpack](https://github.com/hglm/texgenpack) , but I have no idea how to use it.
Maybe you, or someone else, will find a way to use this.

Yes I installed it but when I try to make it work it tells me "pthreadVC2.dll missing" and when I put it in the same folder it tells me "msvcr80.dll missing" at the end when I put these 2 files in the folder it says error...
I'll do some more research, as soon as I find it I'll put it here

Well... Again the worst moment now.
SSO probably changed files again. I don't have PackFiles anymore.
There are files like:
[https://gyazo.com/4962d239400e7e27d0f4d695ef7a9427](https://gyazo.com/4962d239400e7e27d0f4d695ef7a9427)
Maybe now it will be faster to decrypt files?

Don't worry, it's not in the "telemetry" folder, the packfiles are in "client" folder

Hi!
I'm not very good at all of this, to tell the truth I only do it for 3D models and textures ... 
I have decompressed the .csa files but I don't have any .tga files. Could someone help me?

hi guys, im bacc, and i have an app that change the textures of sso horses so, what i want is the textures, anyone else know how to "read" the way that this app works? because this app can change sso textures in the csa text file itself.

i think is all on the file called "base library"
they are in pyd format 

packfiles are now on C:\Program Files (x86)\Star Stable Online\client\PackFiles

okay, this person know how to get in to the files, but if u go to "more model information" u got this:

Total triangles 37.9k 
tharr person uses Autodesk Maya and Zbrush (just for see the 3dmodel)

when u want to put your own texture on sso files you can use .dds format

I want to test something, when your sso has finished updating, still on the home page, go to C:\Program Files (x86)\Star Stable Online\client\PackFiles
and put these files, replacing the files.
when you click "play" within the game, look for a black starter horse, see if it has a different texture.

That person works for Star Stable. Btw you can also use free programs like Blender to see the 3d model if it uses .fbx format.

Sadly, no news. We're still looking for a solution to "unpixelate" textures. By the way- Do anyone know an alternative for 3d Object Converter, which supports .pme files?

Hi! I have been following this forum for a while now and I would like to open the 3D models on Blender. But I can't do it. When I convert the .pme files to .obj using 3DObjectConverter and open the converted file in blender, the model does not display. Can someone help me and tell me how to convert?
Thanks

As you can see there are a lot of unanswered questions, if there was a solution we would all be on it already ^^
But by the way, how did you get your .pme files? I only have .tga and .ptf files

In the same way as for .tga files but with this .bms file; [https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/ ... sp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1WD04LmDnzcJ0F5FZPv-5yPakASKbwg1J?usp=sharing)
You will have all the files of the game except the .tga files which require another .bms file

Are you sure the model doesn't display? For me it display but it's very small, so you have to zoom in or change size of the model.

Yes, it doesn't display 


How do you do the conversion? To avoid polluting this forum too much, you can answer me on discord if you want

Hi!
I'm not very good at all of this, to tell the truth I only do it for 3D models and textures ... 
I have decompressed the .csa files but I don't have any .tga files. Could someone help me?
Thanks

This is probably because you used an older BMS script. As for me I have followed different forums and such and there was a ascript that extracted .tga files for you. I can't rememeber but someone named Lisa (or sso ghosty) rewrote the script and shared it with us. With that script you can get .pte, .pme etc. files.

I want to test something, when your sso has finished updating, still on the home page, go to C:\Program Files (x86)\Star Stable Online\client\PackFiles
and put these files, replacing the files.
when you click "play" within the game, look for a black starter horse, see if it has a different texture.

Also Samyy, can you send me a pm with these files so I can try these too? The drive seems to be locked.

.pme files are the model files. You need to convert them in 3D Object Converter if you want to open them in Blender.

Yes, that's what we know already, the problem still remains within the texture compression/decompression.

I know. I replied to @some1hippiebullshit comment, because she had problem with 3d models. I thought she didn't know that .pme files are the 3d model files.

Hi everyone, 
After multiple researches for the pixelated picture, I think that except to put itself to the programming one will not have the solution so easily. So I went back to the Texgenpack.exe program. It was created in 2016 and a year ago, a post about its functionality was posted : 

https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods ... escription

So that shows you the way to set it up but my problem with it is that I have an "R6034" error that I'm having trouble rectifying. Here's a little hint, I hope you haven't given up.

what is that for?

It's something like Crunch. It's for decompressing, compressing and converting texture files using a genetic algorithm. Btw, the github page says that it was mainly developed for Linux. It contains a Windows port, but it "requires some configuration to provide pthreads and GTK+ for GUI". If someone has time you can create a virtual machine with Linux and try to use texgenpack.

For modeling and animating they use Maya and for textures I think they use photoshop, but I'm not sure about that

Hi!
I stumbled on this forum thread while researching the CSA file format ("Cold Storage Archive" btw). I saw that there are a lot of discussions regarding the texture resources and thought that I should contribute.

Long Story Short
they are not encrypted. They are just compressed with a newer, optimized version of Crunch. Specifically the version that is bundled with [Unity 2017.3](https://blog.unity.com/technology/updated-crunch-texture-compression-library). It's open source, so if you have a developer environment then you can build the tool from sources at [https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/crunch/tree/unity](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/crunch/tree/unity).

Slightly Longer Story
No QuickBMS script I have seen does a very good job at unpacking the CSA files so I wrote my own tool for that. In my opinion, the best approach is to use the csaheader files to unpack the packed resources into a proper folder structure. The QBMS scripts tries to unpack with an internal source path, which is why the output folder looks so weird and many files are corrupted or duplicated.

Doing it properly, you will end up with ~52.000 files in a handful of different formats. The textures are as you already know stored in .PTE files, and there are about 19.000 of them. PTE is also a container format, but it only contains a single texture. The texture is always in DDS-format, but most of them are compressed with Crunch as mentioned above. ~15K textures are compressed, and the rest are plain old DDS.

So to summarize how to do this with code or a script:
Loop through each header file and extract the name, size and offset of each resource in the corresponding csa data file.
Save each resource you are interesting in from the datafiles as separate files.
For each PTE, extract the texture as a CRN or DDS file depending on it's type
Use Crunch to convert them into a common format such as PNG. Handily enough, Crunch can read both CRN & DDS, so you can convert all files in one go. I only found one file that Crunch failed on (Item_PandorianCompass.PTE), so that had to be converted by hand.


The only data that is actually encrypted (well obfuscated at least) are text strings. It's a simple Caesar cipher which you reverse by adding each byte of the data with (lenOfData%16)+1.

3D Object Converter does a pretty good job with reading the mesh files, but unfortunately it doesn't work well with the textures, materials, bones and animations etc... If it was open source I would have fixed it, but it's not and I cant be bothered to write a new converter from scratch just for this.

I hope this helps anyone!

The version we used before was an older version and Star Stable Online uses a newer version of Crunch. At least that's what I understood from locknut's post.

So mystery finally has been solved. I was following this topic in case if someone would crack this.
Thanks for the info, locknut.

Luckily I had one sample left from my research and I was able to test the solution - it works fine.
I have put in the attachment compiled crunch version for Unity with sample CRN file.
Use it like this:

```
crunch_unity.exe -file CS_SignLogo_01.crn
```

Crunch is regular command line program. And it works fine.
There are many tutorials on the web already [https://www.google.com/search?client=fi ... ne+program](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-d&q=how+to+run+command+line+program)

I understood the second step when using the crunch, but what do I do with the .pte file, is it just to change the extension to .dds or .crn?

I understood the second step when using the crunch, but what do I do with the .pte file, is it just to change the extension to .dds or .crn?

It depends on if you have the full PTE file, or if the texture has already been extracted from it. You can check this if you open it with a hexeditor. If the file starts with the string "DDS" or "Hx", then it only contains the texture and you are OK to just rename the file to .DDS or .CRN depending on if it started with DDS or Hx.

If the file does not start with DDS or Hx, then you have the full PTE-file and must delete some bytes from it. Again, open it with a hexeditor and delete all bytes before the "DDS" or "Hx" string.

You need to provide the full path to the image, unless it's in the current working folder of the command prompt. I dont think you put it in the system32 folder

As far as I know PTE and TGA are (almost?) the same file formats. Both are containers for CRN files used by crunch.

By the way, if anyone have issues with converting PTE/TGA files to CRN,
then you can use this quickbms script to do it automatically:
[https://github.com/bartlomiejduda/Tools ... script.bms](https://github.com/bartlomiejduda/Tools/blob/master/NEW%20Tools/Star%20Stable%20Online/Star_Stable_Online_PTE_TGA_script.bms)

I have also updated wiki article with the new findings [http://wiki.xentax.com/index.php/Star_S ... ne_TGA_PTE](http://wiki.xentax.com/index.php/Star_Stable_Online_TGA_PTE)

i tried doing the .crn or .dds manually and i couldn't but the bms script that ikskoks provided worked, i'll try crunch now, thanks for being so patient, it's helping a lot

It should be outputted in the same directory as CRN file, but maybe you don't have write permission in this directory.
Try to move CRN file to your desktop and use crunch_unity there.

Well, that depends on how good are your skills with game modding. If you can use quickbms and crunch 
without issues then it should be easy.

Let's say you have already extracted DDS texture from the game using information from this topic.
Now you need to import file without crashing the game, so your steps should look
probably something like this:

1. Edit your DDS texture in GIMP
2. Convert DDS to CRN with crunch_unity
3. Convert CRN texture to TGA/PTE with my script (use reimport mode)
4. Pack data to CSA archive using script from aluigi (use reimport mode) [https://aluigi.altervista.org/bms/star_ ... online.bms](https://aluigi.altervista.org/bms/star_stable_online.bms)
5. Launch the game and test your changes

And in theory it should work now.

Not really, TGA is simply the standard Targa file format ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truevision_TGA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truevision_TGA)) and has nothing to do with PTE or CRN. The references to TGA-files in the CSA-files are just the original names of the files before they were converted to DDS and packed. If you look closer at the paths for the TGA-files you will see path like these:

```
\\Pixel\share1\StarStableOnline\Media\Characters\Birds\Bird_2.tga
U:\StarStableOnline\Media\Items\BrownPackage\BrownPackage.tga
```


So these are just the names of the images as they appeared for the game designer, just ignore them... I don't know why they are in the files at all, maybe simply to assist during debugging.

Yeah, of course, I know that "real" TGA file format is different. We have this on our wiki [http://wiki.xentax.com/index.php/TGA_Image](http://wiki.xentax.com/index.php/TGA_Image)

I menat TGA\PTE from Star Stable Online (for some reason quickbms script from aluigi extracts those files as TGA, not PTE, maybe that's the real source of confusion here?)

Btw, article with SSO TGA\PTE file format is here [http://wiki.xentax.com/index.php/Star_S ... ne_TGA_PTE](http://wiki.xentax.com/index.php/Star_Stable_Online_TGA_PTE)

Yes, exactly. The script tries to save the files with the source name (.tga) instead of the true name (.pte). The true name is only in the csaheader-file.

We actually know how to convert .dds files but there is still a problem about converting them into games files. C.C Creations once did a software for SSO to change textures. It named "Pimp my horse" or something like that. It doesn't work for me anymore. Maybe someone would like to fix this software?

The only data that is actually encrypted (well obfuscated at least) are text strings. It's a simple Caesar cipher which you reverse by adding each byte of the data with (lenOfData%16)+1.

3D Object Converter does a pretty good job with reading the mesh files, but unfortunately it doesn't work well with the textures, materials, bones and animations etc... If it was open source I would have fixed it, but it's not and I cant be bothered to write a new converter from scratch just for this.

Hi! Thank you, you're a savior. 

I've been looking for bones and animations as well 'cause as you said the 3D object converter doesn't import those at all. Since you've said that no data (except for the text strings) is encrypted I've wondered if you know any way to open the bone and animation files ( .pan I believe) and could shine some light on it too?

I have not looked at the pan-files yet, only the meshes (pme), materials (pmt) and textures (pte). Those are converting nicely now.

The bones appears to be in the skinmesh files (psm), and the PAN I guess are the animations. Exporting them to text files would be relatively easy, the real challenge will be to sort out which float are coordinates, rotations, timestamps etc etc, and then converting it back something that can be read by other tools. I don't know if there is an suitable open format to convert to?

Did anybody figure out how to fix this? I have the same issue, even if it says that the file was reimported, it stays a .crn file. I tried every script I have and the effect was the same every time.

I contacted CC yesterday and she said that she was planning on updating the program, but right now she doesn't have much time or motivation. I guess we could still ask her for some tips though.
Maybe we could find some clues in the files of that Pimp My Horse program? The setup can still be downloaded here: [https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/ ... 8qokMEnhHa](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1mtjvOJlP0J2cTYDUMa5y4m8qokMEnhHa)

I've also seen that people who were importing the textures into the game files say that they were using a hex editor (I think that refers to converting crn files back to tga files, but it might be more than that?). Maybe someone can figure out a method of importing the files using a hex editor?

It can most likely be done, but it's probably harder now than before. Before, the textures were not compressed which meant that even if you changed it, it would stay the exact same size. So you could just paste a new texture over the original. Today, most textures are compressed, and that means that when you change a texture and recompress it, it will never have the exact same file size as the original.

So, on top of replacing the texture in the .csa file, you will also have to "relocate" all the other resources in the file. There are also some checksums and other details that may need to be recalculated, depending on how much the game validates during launch.

When I recently used Pimp My Horse (which was last updated in 2019) and checked the files, it looked as if the new textures were simply pasted in. In-game everything worked just fine, and you could see the new textures. Maybe it still works in a pretty similar way?

Basically what locknut said gives you the idea how it works.

This method is straight-forward and can be used to mod ANY game, not only SSO:
1. First your new file has to be smaller or equal in size compared to original file.
2. Then you just copy and paste data in hex editor.
3. Then you add missing padding to fill the space (just fill with zeroes)

And that's it (when you're lucky and there are no checksums to correct). You don't need any scripts - but it's a lot of manual work. 
That's why it is often better to do it with scripts.

Did you change the mane too? The only thing that doesn’t work for me is changing the mane, even after reinstalling multiple times. Still it would be nice to have a new/updated software since there are many new breeds that aren’t included in pimp my horse.

Things what I do:
1. Open "Pimp my horse sso" as an administrator
2. Check your texture how big it is. Height and width must be like 900x900. Scale your texture then 
3. Not sure how you open software with game but I'm doing it like that:
First open your game, log in.
If your game updated and you see button "play" then open pimp my horse as an administrator, like i've said before.
Then check your textures and add them into game

So I tried to mix both methods:
1. I first used crunch on the dds file and got a crn file
2. I renamed the file to tga
3. I opened it in a hex editor and added 25 bytes at the beggining. 

When I did the whole process in reverse i got a dds file, so the method is working and the tga file can be imported back into the game. The only question is, how do I import it to csa?

You can't because the old script "star_stable_online.bms" doesnt work anymore  except if you modify it as prescribed in the previous pages of the forum but you will get the files in .pte and not in .tga

I just realized a short time ago that the .tga files are no longer available

The first thing I would try would be to just paste the CRN-file into the CSA-file over the original data.  If it's smaller than the original, then it might be as simple as that, but they might also do some checks on the size and checksums, and if so the best option is to write a script to do it so you don't have to recalculate those values manually.

Steps 2 & 3 above is not necessary.

How do I paste the crn file into the csa file though? I'm assuming that putting the crn file into csa file's directory wouldn't do anything, so how should I do it? I've tried using bms (reimport mode) with aluigi's script, but it didn't do anything.

How do I paste the crn file into the csa file though? I'm assuming that putting the crn file into csa file's directory wouldn't do anything, so how should I do it? I've tried using bms (reimport mode) with ikskoks' script, but it didn't do anything.

With a hexeditor for example. Open the CSA with the hexeditor and paste the new data at the correct position. You will need to know the position first. If you find these tips confusing, you might be in over your head here

Hello everyone! i'm a total newbie to all this  this thread has been super helpful to me but i still have a couple of problems... I have the PTE files converted with crunch unity. I can open all the PME in 3d file converter... But what do i do with the PMT files? The main problem i seem to have is the main character, you have to pick from lots of multiples at the start of the game and these all appear on the keypose mannequin as materials in a scene. 3d object converter doesn't seem to let you delete things from the scene but does highlight them all separately. I can export wavefront .obj for blender and it lists all the materials but it wont remove them separately I can remove them all and still left with a mess. Am I exporting in the wrong format? Its like when i exported it it's made it all a solid item even tho the materials are listed. BUT i need the .pmt files to build her up from scratch and they're the only thing i havent been able to touch. Hope this makes sense lol can anyone help? thanks in advance!

Just to clarify - my script is only for converting textures as explained [here](https://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?p=181161#p181161).

For importing to CSA archives you need other script from aluigi (I have also mentioned it in the same post [here](https://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?p=181161#p181161)). But keep in mind that in some cases it may not work properly or it can be outdated etc. etc. 

You can also try to do it manually with hex editor as it was explained by locknut above.

I'm not really sure what your question is. The PMT files defines the materials used on different parts of the models. Most importantly the texture, but also some other parameters.  3D Converter didn't read them properly when I tested it.

I’m not sure either anymore  I only wanted to make a blender model of the main character but so far I have a main character model with all the game items attached to it that I can’t get rid of and a load of flat png. ‘Textures’ I’ve probably messed up big time somewhere  maybe I used a bad script somewhere along the line probably at the unpacking stage? And should I have convterted the dds files to png.? That seems pretty useless in blender? Sorry for being a dummy

Try this:

Open the PME in 3D Converter and export as Wavefront OBJ. This will generate a .obj file and a .mtl file.

Open the .mtl file in a texteditor. It will look similar to this:

```
Ka 0.200000 0.200000 0.200000
Kd 1.000000 1.000000 1.000000
Ks 0.000000 0.000000 0.000000
illum 2
Ns 8.000000
map_Kd MrAnwir_v2_Body.pte
```


"map_Kd" specifies the texture files, and it will incorrectly point to the ".pte" file. Change this to whatever your real converted texture is named. For example "MrAnwir_v2_Body.png" in this example if you converted them to PNG.

Now import the .obj file in Blender. Make sure that you in the import options select "Split by Group". This will make create nice sub objects so you can remove the parts you dont want.

The base body texture for GH38 is called "HorseBody.pte" and is just a grey color. Then you have a number of different textures called:

GH38_Body_01
GH38_Body_02
GH38_Body_03

etc...  with the different variants. The same mesh is used for different looks.

Yes, but it’s the lowest “number” you can find textures of. I think they were referring to textures GH37 and below.

Older textures (GH37 and below) have names such as Horse35Body_02.pte, instead of GH35_Body_02.pte.

Do you by any chance know where to find older mane and tail textures too?

If you have the model files, then the fastest way to check the textures is probably convert it to OBJ-format with for example 3D Object Convert and then open each resulting .mtl file with a text editor, you will the name of the textures there.

It's not working, I'm putting all the data from the .crn file in the csa, but the game crashes

it is like that? no because my game is crashing, so what am i doing wrong? 
i tried add the .crn data in the same place of the original one, without deleting the original one, the game crashes again, when i get close to the horse the game just close

There are many things that could go wrong here. I haven't tried modifying the files myself, just parsing them, so don't take anything I say as the truth.

But, I'm pretty sure it wont work if you fill the header with zeros like that. That part contains important information about the resource that the game probably needs to function.

If you want to change the horses texture you can just use Pimp My Horse. After changing the texture in Pimp My Horse go to the game files and look for the .csa file that was recently edited. After finding it- copy it (for example) to your desktop and open the games launcher. After logging in, the launcher should update the files. Now, leave it the way it is and DON'T CLICK THE "PLAY" BUTTON. You need to go to the game files again and change the .csa file to the file that you copied to your desktop before. After that, you can just click the "play" button and it should work fine if you did everything right. For me it works. I tried this method around week ago.

- Post Title: Re: Star Stable Online - CSA & TGA files

ok guys, for a long time i tried several ways, none worked, but i will quote what i tried to do:
1st - copy pmhsso, I tried to do what pimp my horse does, I used gimp and made my own file that started with DDS, I put it exactly where pmhsso put it, it didn't work, when I compared the file that pmhsso put it in the game, with my own image separate from the game file, I noticed that they had additional "random" data that pmhsso itself puts, this is the data that makes the modified texture work in the game, I don't know how it works.
2°- when I use the .dds file (own) in crunch, it turns into a .crn, when I use the same .crn in crunch again, it turns into a .dds totally different from the previous .dds, this confused me so I'm just "warning" this to you, I tried to use all the data from these files: .dds by gimp, .crn and .dds by crunch, none works.
3°- I tried to find the .pte that we extracted from the .csa, and compare it with the .csa file where it is located, it was there, the texture format that is in the .csa is .pte, the data is there, but when comparing, the "pte data" that was there in the CSA were MUCH bigger, there were additional data there, I really don't know what they are, but they are important, the only thing I didn't compare was if the data that pmhsso left it there, it was the same additional data that the original file left along with the .pte texture data
4° another thing I tried, I modified the game with pmhsso and went to the modified csa file, copied all the DDS data that phmsso placed, and pasted it in another empty folder, to be able to open the first word it has to be DDS , and there it was, the same image I used to modify the game (and it had the additional data)
*I did all this from hxdeditor*

hi i managed to obtain the horse models and textures from the game and i opened them in blender. i experimented with the texas bluebell (nsh) and it worked! i also extracted some of the other breeds as well and they all worked fine. the animations were even ripped with the models as well but i cba to record a video and put it up here just for a forum post.

(looks weird bc the shaders arent on)


//if you want the models and textures you can message me if you like

(btw the .tga format the textures are in are basically useless and unreadable so you shouldnt even bother with those, get them in .dds and modify it with a hex editor so theyre readable or just use .png instead)

anyways why i even posted on here in the first place: does anyone know how extract the game sounds?? because there are some old, really unique sounds that i want saved but nobody seems to know how to do it (

What tool did you use to export the animations? I wrote my own tool to export the resources but I haven't completed the bones yet. If there is another tool that does this already it could save me some time

That part is actually easy. They are in FMOD bank format. There are multiple ways to convert those, I think I used "Fmod Bank Tools" as shown here [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEszRtTQpo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBEszRtTQpo)

Hi ! 3D models are .PME files, you can open them with 3D Object Converter and convert them to open with Blender   

When I converted the 3D models for blender, models are incomplete... Does anyone have a solution? and how to apply a texture on blender ?

If you're going to use 3D Object Converter to convert models, then you need to buy a register otherwise models are going to have holes in them. You can also try to write a program like 3D Object Converter yourself, but if you want so then you need to do research regarding it yourself.
There are many tutorials on Youtube on how to apply textures to models in Blender. Just follow the tutorial regarding crunch and textures (which is in this topic) and then you can use those textures in Blender.

Ty!
 I know how to access textures and I have watched videos about applying textures in Blender but I have not found anything about applying such a detailed texture to a model that is also very detailed. All I found were videos on how to apply the same texture on all the faces of a cube or on a sphere

Just do it the same way. If the texture looks weird on a model then try to play around with UV.

Hey! Anyone knows how to get models from the game? Or someone has starter horse model? Thanks for the answer! I really need to know how to get models


Hi ! 3D models are .PME files, you can open them with 3D Object Converter and convert them to open with Blender   

When I converted the 3D models for blender, models are incomplete... Does anyone have a solution? and how to apply a texture on blender ?

I'm not really sure how to do it. Can you explain please? ^^'

putting the textures manually will probably never work, the game won't open if the file is not the EXACT size of the original, does anyone have any other suggestions on how to add custom textures in the game? (WITHOUT PMHSSO)

I added a very simple user interface to my tool for extracting the textures and models. I'm working on some other features that may get released later, but since many people appear to have problems getting the models, I figured that I should publish a preview version. It converts everything to Collada DAE files that can imported into Blender without issues. I will release the source code later, but there are a lot of crap to clean up first.

It can be downloaded here: [https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/ ... sp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1pr8yDa8RsOtPyiJ5JRwuvvuPgP4BRKVD?usp=sharing)

To run it, you first need to install the .NET 6 Desktop Runtime. from [https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/down ... .0/runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0/runtime)

Looks like this:

Hi! Yes, it looks like you have DPI-scaling enabled in Windows. Thanks for reporting it! I forgot to test that scenario.

I have uploaded a new fixed version that you can try (same link as above). Or you can temporarily set the scaling to 100% and use the first version...

You're right, something went wrong there. I've updated it again, so if you download it again it should work. It doesn't look perfect, but the buttons are visible.

Tysm for your program, its really useful ! But the coats are not on the 3D models of the horses and the program doesnt extract the textures of the coats

Ah yes, that's true. The coats are actually not part of the models, they are assigned dynamically by the game. And my tool skips all textures that are not attached to a model. But I see that it would be useful to extract all textures, I'll change that...

A "preview 4" version has now been uploaded that extracts all textures. Those not used by any models are put in the "AdditionalTextures" folder in the destination. It's over 13.000 files so the extraction will take a little bit longer now.

Collada was a pretty neat choice, though I think they might be just saving it as an autodesk fbx. Did you have any luck with the armature and animation files? Would be great to see the functionality in your tool as well. Though I also fear our joy won't be for long and the devs will be quick to patch the future files. With a such a nifty app all their work will be in the hands of kids now, so I reckon the knowledge will spread like a wildfire

If you use my tool you will get a number of DAE files. To open them in Blender you just go to File/Import menu item and select Collada import.

It wont help you with modding the game though. That is much more complicated.

I think that the game designers use FBX internally, but in the game files they are converted into this PME format used by their custom game engine. I don't think they care that much about us looking at the resources, but it could be smart to save a copy of the current files just in case they change the format 

The animation files are pretty simple, and the armatures share format with the models but with added bone data and deformation weights. I know how to read them, but my math is a bit off so they don't look right.

There should not be any crn files in the destination if everything worked as it should.

Please try again and use a new empty folder as the destination. If you still see crn files afterwards, then something went wrong. There will be a text file with debug info there, if you zip that and send it to me in a PM I might be able to see what the reason is.

This is not a thread nor forum for painter. I would advise to go and ask on Substance Painter forums   Otherwise pretty soon it will be hard to find anything in this thread with questions like that.

Hi! When I use your program I get an error message, it only extracts the textures till CSA4. There are also a lot of crn files in the folder.

I realised that this will happen if you try to extract to a destination that contains spaces in the folder name. Maybe this is the bug you have as well...

It's fixed in the latest version, so you can try downloading that or extract to a folder without spaces in the name.

This happened because one of your CSA-files was corrupted or modified. I will change the tool so it won't stop just because one asset was bad.

They use program by c.c creations called 'Pimp my horse sso'. Type it in youtube and you'll get video tutorials where to get it and how to use it.

I don't know much besides basic python, but have been working with 3D for some time now so I'm willing to help as well if you need it.

I'm copying my message here:

Hello! I modified the bms file (I wrote 1 instead of 0 Xd) and with this star stable online bms, quickbms will extract the pte, pmt and more sso files.

I'll send the new bms (I only tried with the csaheader files, but unpacked the same as the csa actually):
https://drive.google.com/file/d/16f9qMSo...sp=sharing
And I'm sending one pte file from the folder :

https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qhrk3mU...sp=sharing

...And you can open the pme files!

Hello the link isn't available... can you re send it please ?

I have a question on this forum, is it forbidden to ask about modifying game textures? because everytime someone asks about this someone deletes the post, this happened to me 2 times, i don't think it should be banned, it doesn't change the forum thread itself

No, asking about textures is not forbidden. Forbidden is spamming and posting off-topic messages.

This is reverse-engineering forum, so we should focus here on technical details and stop asking over and over again the same questions like:
- "how can I open the textures and edit them?"
- "Does anyone know how to change the textures of the pets?"

It won't help anybody. Those questions were already asked several times (just read 15 pages in this topic and see for yourself) and few answers have already been posted.

Besides, I've already warned you once [viewtopic.php?p=181957#p181957](https://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?p=181957#p181957)
Please consider this message as your last warning.

Hello... So I was just wondering, no one has figured out how to replace them in-game after you edit them? Because I found the eyes texture in .DDS Format, and when I'm done recoloring them, I want to import my recolored eyes into the game...

I added a very simple user interface to my tool for extracting the textures and models. I'm working on some other features that may get released later, but since many people appear to have problems getting the models, I figured that I should publish a preview version. It converts everything to Collada DAE files that can imported into Blender without issues. I will release the source code later, but there are a lot of crap to clean up first.

It can be downloaded here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/ ... sp=sharing

To run it, you first need to install the .NET 6 Desktop Runtime. from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/down ... .0/runtime

Looks like this:

Hi ! 3D models are no longer extracted...

Hi ! 3D models are no longer extracted...

I just tested it with the last game version and the models were extracted fine. Make sure your game files are original and try to export again into a new empty folder.

I created a new forum topic in the game specific tool area: [viewtopic.php?f=32&t=25224](https://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=32&t=25224)

I suggest that all future questions and discussion about this tool is posted there.

Hi again after long time! I am working on adding more horses to Pimp my horse sso and I add the new "Tinker" (Irish cob) first. But I have a problem.. If I choose my Irish cob texture, and I click on: "Change body in SSO", I got: "DDS file too big!". My DDS file's size is only 428 bite...I need to fix this but if you have any ideas.. Thank you!

you can try to resize the image to a smaller size try 800x800, or smaller and how did you do this in the program? when you finish could you send a download or tutorial?

I changed the texture's size in gimp, that's because it's only 428 bite. And yes, I send soon my files, so you can see the changes in the files, to see if you have any ideas. I did it with our popular hex editor, Hxd  .
Update: I added 2 new colors of the new Andalusians, that weren’t in the program before, and the GH46 (new andalusian) texture in my UV layouts folder work with them! So not my file editing in the hex editor is the problem luckily.. And here is my files, like I promised: [https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/ ... sp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1virZbAxAP420mwyTns_3UWRzbZqgw0-l?usp=sharing)

Thank you :3! All changes in the Data folder of Pimp my horse SSO, You can look for changes there. In the "Thumbnails" folder (It's In the Data to) you can find only PNG photos about the horses. I used Hxd to add new horses, as I said.

Hi ! I tested your version of pmh but unfortunately it does not work on my side... For the irish cob, I have the same mistake as you and for the two models of Andalusian, it does to me this: [https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/ ... sp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1f8er3Dr9kpawpuqCMxORHq-KUOrTvDql?usp=sharing)

I just need to know if you're aware of any problems like this, and if I can be certain that it's safe?

The files that I have shared are safe to run. What anti-virus program are you using? My tools reads and writes a large number of files and creates a lot of sub processes during the conversion, this could probably been seen as "suspicious" by some security programs.

Oh ok. And the Program I'm using is Bitdefender... So should I add your Program as an exception then?

is it easy to pack and compress the textures back into the game? (textures made by me for example)


Well, that depends on how good are your skills with game modding. If you can use quickbms and crunch 
without issues then it should be easy.

Let's say you have already extracted DDS texture from the game using information from this topic.
Now you need to import file without crashing the game, so your steps should look
probably something like this:

1. Edit your DDS texture in GIMP
2. Convert DDS to CRN with crunch_unity
3. Convert CRN texture to TGA/PTE with my script (use reimport mode)
4. Pack data to CSA archive using script from aluigi (use reimport mode) https://aluigi.altervista.org/bms/star_ ... online.bms
5. Launch the game and test your changes

And in theory it should work now.
Hello... I was just wondering if you could help me understand this a little better, please..? So, I edited my texture, I don't know where to get Crunch Unity, so could you please link it to me?, What does reimport mode mean?, I'll try to use your script from Aluigi, and I'm excited to launch my game and test my changes if it works... Thank you if you respond and help me understand a little better! :3

Crunch_unity is "special" version of crunch shared here [viewtopic.php?p=181059#p181059](https://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?p=181059#p181059)

Reimport mode is just a functionality of quickbms to import files back to archives.

Oh ok, thank you! But I'm a little confused at "convert the crn to tga/pte with your script"... So, I open your script in QuickBMS, I select your script, I type "*" to select the folder and subfolders, I type the name of the folder where I want it to extract, "What Exactly". but the tga/pte files don't appear... {{Apparently I can't send videos so I have to send the videos through Mediafire...}}

Reimporting process is similar to exporting.
You basically do these steps:
1. Click on "reimport.bat" in quickbms.
2. Select BMS script.
3, Select "Input archive". In your case it will be original PTE texture file.
4. Select output directory. In your case it is a directory where CRN file was extracted (e.g. "output1").

In case with further issues with quickbms, try to find a tutorial to guide you through the process

Where do I find the original PTE texture file? For me the PTE Files didn't extract

It was already discussed here [viewtopic.php?p=181192#p181192](https://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?p=181192#p181192)
TGA and PTE are the same files for SSO. What output name you get is defined by script's/tool's naming convention (true name or source name).

Line 7 in below script is the setting for naming.

Oh ok... I tried to use the Script you linked me and put it in QuickBMS, and it worked up until I got this error... Because of the error not everything extracted... Do you know what the error means?

Coverage value is 100%, so in most cases it means that everything was extracted perfectly.  
Maybe script doesn't have proper break condition to finish work when it reaches 100%.

You can compare archive file size and output directory size to be sure. 
The sizes should be similar when no compression is used in the archive.

But when I search "Hat" nothing comes up... So, if it extracted everything then Hat would've come up, right?

If you just want to extract all the resources without fuzz, then you can also use "SSO Extract" as described here [viewtopic.php?f=32&t=25224](https://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=32&t=25224).

I did, but SSO Extract doesn't come with the TGA or PTE Files, which I need, don't I?

It depends on what you want to do. But the last version has the option to save all resources without converting them to different format, this will get you all the PTE-files.

I'm sorry but I'm still a little confused...  I used SSO Extract to find the .DDS Texture, I edited it in Photoshop, I converted the edited .DDS to .CRN with Crunch_Unity, I clicked on "reimport.bat" on my desktop, I don't know how to do it within QuickBMS..? I selected the BMS Script, I selected the .CRN file, I selected the extract directory folder, but nothing happened. It just showed this within a second, {{Welp the picture file is apparently "too big", so I'll have to send it on MediaFire. Also, my computer is running slow right now so it's saying "This file is either not supported or corrupt." As in, the picture isn't even loading.}} and when I checked the extract directory folder, there was nothing there... It would help if you could do a tutorial video somewhere? I understand if you're not able to

I'm not the author of quickBMS, so I don't know how it should work in this situation, but from my experience you need to use the same method for extract and import, because it won't work otherwise. So you need to extract with quickbms script instead SSOExtract.
BUT no one really confirmed in this topic that script from aluigi works with reimport mode (not all scripts have support for that - keep that in mind).

> It would help if you could do a tutorial video somewhere
There are some available on the web already. Just go to "Video" tab in google [https://imgur.com/a/34SsenP](https://imgur.com/a/34SsenP)

No, but extracting them is pretty much the same thing. You just see the content on disk instead of in a tool. What are you actually trying to achieve?

Well extracting just extracts them to a folder, instead of actually going inside the game files in order to replace them

Well, then you were not really asking "how to open the files". You want to know to mod the game, which is a completely different question and it has been discussed over and over again in this thread.

It's not. But it's regularly cleared out of spam messages.
(Remember that this is reverse engineering forum, so let's focus on that here)

No one is really doing any real research on this game right now (beside @locknut maybe), so I wouldn't expect any great progress on modding soon.

Hi! I was able to get the model and texture files but I was wondering if there is a way to get the model rigs? Or is that something you have to create on your own. Like, is there a file with the bones/armatures of the horse models? I would like to try posing the models.

Yes, the CSA format is fully understood. But it's just a container of other files. To get information about quests and other items you need to look into the scene files. So I would recommend to extract all files with each file type in a separate folder for easier exploration.

I have a script that executes everything, so changing horses, finishing quests, healing horse, etc. is as easy as one click.

I see, thank you for your response.

I have a script that executes everything, so changing horses, finishing quests, healing horse, etc. is as easy as one click.

Hello! Would you mind sharing your script, please? Most of the scripts I've tried fail to extract a few textures and models

OK SO I ACTUALLY FOUND A WAY TO REPLACE THE NEWER HORSE TEXTURES!! It's not even that hard!

What You'll Need: Star Stable Online - Pimp My Horse - SSO Extract - Photo Editing Software That Can Open .DDS Format


Step 1: Extract everything converted using SSO Extract (It can take a while)

Step 2: Search GH

Step 3: Find the texture of the horse you wanna change

Step 4: Open the .DDS in Photo Editing Software

Step 5: Edit it how you want

Step 6: Size it a little (I usually size it to 300 by 300 but I think you can go higher than that for more detail)

Step 8: Save it somewhere on your Desktop

Step 9: Open Pimp My Horse

Step 10: Click "Choose Horse From List"

Step 11: Find your Starter Horse texture

Step 12: Click "Confirm"

Step 13: Find the PackFiles folder (It should be C:\Program Files (x86)\Star Stable Online\PackFiles )

Step 14: Paste it in where it says "PackFiles Folder:"

Steo 15: Click "Choose Your DDS File"

Step 16: Click the texture you saved somewhere on your Desktop

Step 17: Click "Change Body in SSO"

Step 18: Log on to Star Stable

Step 19: Ride your Starter Horse

Step 20: Go to the Jarlaheim Bus Stop

Step 21: Sit on the bench closest to the Bus Stop

Step 22: Go to the Mall

Step 23: Leave the Mall

Step 24: Go to a shop

Step 25: Stand up

Step 26: Go to your Home Stable

Step 27: Sit down in the chair at your Home Stable

Step 28: Close the shop

Step 29: Ride your Starter Horse

Step 30: Change Starter Horse Appearance

Step 31: Stand up

Step 32: Ride any horse out of the Home Stable

Step 33: Go back in the Home Stable

Step 34: Ride the horse you want to change the texture of

Step 35: Click Reset

Then it should have the custom texture!!! I hope this helped :3

I decided to make a Discord Server for talking a little more about this x3- It's not as advanced, it's mostly just for sharing your creations on Pimp My Horse SSO. So if anyone wants to join, I can give the link here :3

Does anyone know where Pimp My Horse keeps the horse models to make it work?

I think you need to realize that not many people here are interested in PMH. Also, this thread is about the CSA and image file formats, and those have now been fully reversed and there is not much more to discuss.

i noticed that the SSO files changed since i cannot find them under Programe x86 anymore. the sso folder is empty. i modified my computer to show all hidden files and then i found some, called cache and news. however, there is nothing interesting there. i just deinstalled and reinstalled the game - nothing changed, but it works. anyone knows how to be able to get to the files ? there must be a way since C C Creations is still active

I think they upgraded their installer to 64bit, so the files are in Programs and not Programs 32 anymore. Search for Star Stable on your drive and you should find them.

Collada was a pretty neat choice, though I think they might be just saving it as an autodesk fbx. Did you have any luck with the armature and animation files? Would be great to see the functionality in your tool as well. Though I also fear our joy won't be for long and the devs will be quick to patch the future files. With a such a nifty app all their work will be in the hands of kids now, so I reckon the knowledge will spread like a wildfire 


I think that the game designers use FBX internally, but in the game files they are converted into this PME format used by their custom game engine. I don't think they care that much about us looking at the resources, but it could be smart to save a copy of the current files just in case they change the format 

The animation files are pretty simple, and the armatures share format with the models but with added bone data and deformation weights. I know how to read them, but my math is a bit off so they don't look right.

I've tested your software and it's excellent, thank you. As far as the animation files are concerned, I've concentrated on the .pan files. If you open them in HxD, you'll see that they contain all the fbx animations, or rather all the strings in fbx format and that the only way to get them is to create a bms script. But if they're attached to .pme it seems a lot more complex than just unpacking the file. (.pan are just package format) 

 I'd be interested in any ideas you might have.   

And for those who are still interested in PMH(pimp my horse), it no longer works, the horse wears a grayish texture without relief and for the manes the texture is replaced by another of the same breed. I think SSO has patched their files.

Hi!
I have reversed engineered the PAN-files and written the code to parse them. I don't really think it's FBX format, but I havent studied FBX so I could be wrong.

I haven't added the animations to my tool, mostly because lack of time, but also because I got stock on some of the skeletons that still appear rotated 90 degrees for some models, and I figured that it doesn't make sense to add animations unless the skeletons are correct.

Basically I'm just gonna start out really simple, and then explain more in depth if someone replies.

I want to modify a game called Star Stable Online, the first few things I want to modify for the basics are: Play animations anywhere, Teleport, Swim, Change models.

So, how would I make those things happen? And if it's too difficult for me, would anyone be willing to do it for me?

This is simple, provide the dc. Every thing you're looking for is not directly related to the main topic of this post. No one will give out the exact method used by 'cc creations' or 'starstablespoilers_community'. These individuals have experience in advanced modifications such as accessing unavailable quests or acquiring horses/events/items that are inaccessible to anyone else
