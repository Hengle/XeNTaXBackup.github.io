- Post Title: Help with the .bmodels of Wolfenstein: The New Order

Heyo,

I've recently been extracting some of the .resources files of Wolf: TNO in order to view some of the unused models of the game. So far I've been able to turn the .bmd6models into .objs with one of the tools shared on the site , but I've been unable to find a functional one for the bmodels.

If anyone could help me in finding this kind of tool (or at least one that can convert .bmodels into readable Blender files), I would greatly appreciate it!
