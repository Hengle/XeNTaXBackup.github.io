- Post Title: PSP - Ape escape Saru Saru Big Mission LZS files, help?

So I found out about these LZS files on this game and that they are some kind of container file (since it packs all the .i3r models, with all .tm2 textures), I found loads of topics about these files, but none of the methods of decompressing these files seems to work (even NISDecmp.exe crashes when I try to decompress such file).

Can someone help me here?
