- Post Title: .a2 Textures

Hi, i need to convert/extract .a2 textures to readable format like tga oder png.
The textures was referenced as .tga in the model file. 

Here are 3 sample files: [https://www.mediafire.com/file/p1rwtg5d ... s.zip/file](https://www.mediafire.com/file/p1rwtg5d6xf60me/Textures.zip/file)

Anyone can help or know a tool to convert/extract?

Big thanks

They are compressed with DXT1. You can use rawtex to extract image data [https://imgur.com/a/KZ1As30](https://imgur.com/a/KZ1As30)
