- Post Title: Throne Of Darkness: A Challenge Forgotten!

Greetings!  For some time I have slaved over the net, searching for ways to extract files from the .lot format.  My luck in this matter is as good as the success of the late Click Entertainment.  Throne of Darkness has within it a fantastic soundtrack: worthy enough to listen to on a regular basis - at least on my account.

I eventually found my way to the wiki site only to find that this file format is [not supported](http://wiki.xentax.com/index.php/Throne_Of_Darkness)!  Following the obvious trail to these forums, I've found that once, almost exactly two whole years ago (which is rather strange mind you, since I'm appearing out of nowhere to bring this topic up again), [someone requested this game to be looked into](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?p=3271&highlight=throne+darkness#3271).

Now... no offense to the mighty admin of this site, but it would seem this game - with such a unique file format - is an aging enigma that MUST BE SOLVED!  So... I ask - with great emphasis on how humbly I can request this - please, please, please take up this forgotten challenge and raise the status of the MultiEx even higher!

Forgot to get this out there... whoops!

This is so small of a sample, with probably nothing on it except for the fact that it is a .lot file.  I hope someone can figure this encryption out with a small file as this... if not, I'd like some advice as to where to put a bigger file...

Sagesound, there is absolutely nothing relevant in that file.
no sound, no gfx, no file, nothing. we would need a much larger file than 
a few hundred bytes to be able to analyze it properly. atleast i do =o

that tiny file is basically an XML file.

I realize that, given its 1KB size, hence my secondary request!  However, here's another file that's much bigger.
I hope you can get something out of this one.

Its a config file for functions of the game.
not a single byte of extraordinary data there either =((

a bigger file? and with another name....

like....sound.lot   or....   voices.lot   ...or music.lot? =O

I know what you're asking - by stating the obvious, but as it turns out, the late Click Entertainment were really, really picky with their file naming, as if they really didn't expect anyone to be peeking around.  The .LOT files listed for Throne Of Darkness are as follows...

Base.lot = 35,589 KB
Characters.lot = 196,388 KB
Config.lot = 1,808 KB
LoadSequence.lot = 1 KB
Quests.lot = 15,238 KB
Samurai.lot = 320,361 KB
Stream.lot = 251,717 KB
World.lot = 345,106 KB

Now... my first guess, which is likely yours as well, would be to check out the World, Stream, Samurai, and Character .LOT files, as they are big enough to suggest something of value contained within.  My guess for the music would have to be the World.lot, while voices are probably in the Samurai.lot ...however...

If you can suggest a method for me to get 300+ megs of data to you to pick apart, I'd be happy to hear what you have in mind.

By the way Strobe... are you able to look into the files I've already given you, or are you taking a guess as to what's in them?  If you can read them, and possibly extract, how?  If you tell me, I can do it on my end and give you the fruits that yeild.

First of all. yes ive been peeking inside both files, and the
only thing of "value" inside config.lot is that it is full of texts
that seems to configurations for the game, nothing more.
use an hexeditor, like hex workshop. =)

The files you suggested and showed there (the big ones)
does most likely contain what we want it to contain, music, sounds,
etc etc. however i do not have any idea which file it could be.

I dont know a way to upload these big files =( , try DC session with me?
or can you set up an FTP from your computer? anything goes, im really
curious what these may contain.

at first, try to upload Base.lot somewhere, that MAY contain something usefull, atleast its 35mb instead of 1.8 =o

im open to suggestions! 

By the way. open Config.lot in Notepad or Wordpad, and you see what i meen.
