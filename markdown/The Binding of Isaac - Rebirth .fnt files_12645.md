- Post Title: The Binding of Isaac - Rebirth .fnt files

Hey there dudes and dudettes!

I want to translate BoIR, and so far I'm doing good. My problem is that some unicode characters aren't supported, so I thought I'd go and edit the fonts.

The font files are made from two files: One .png file with the font graphics, and one .fnt file which supposedly tells the game what file to use, where each letters are and stuff. Unfortunately this file seems encrypted, and I don't know how to edit them. There are lots of programs that can generate .fnt files from .png's, but I don't know the one I need.

If anyone can help me with this (either by looking at some files or pointing at the right editor) would be appreciated
