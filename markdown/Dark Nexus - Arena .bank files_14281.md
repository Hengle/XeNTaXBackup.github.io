- Post Title: Dark Nexus - Arena .bank files

Greetings! I'm looking for a way to extract music from the recently shut-down MOBA Dark Nexus - Arena. The game's sounds are stored in .Bank files, but the regular dumper for bank doesn't seem to be working here. (Or maybe I'm just to inexperienced, I don't know) Any suggestions? 

EDIT: Never mind, that was me being stupid. I screwed up when cutting off the header using a HEX editor. I'm alright now and apologise for the useless thread. Feel free to delete it.
