- Post Title: Decompiling/Extracting CryEngine Animations

For a while now, we've been able to decompile CryEngine .pak files from multiple games (Crysis series, Evolve, WarFace, etc.), but I was wondering if anyone had luck decompiling animation files rather than the models, textures, and sounds.

I've been trying to get animations from Evolve and WarFace specifically, but I'm stuck on the compiled files inside the paks. These include .dba, .caa, .caf, and .img files.
I have no found any sort of ways to import or decompile any of those files, and trying some other programs like offzip and QuickBMS haven't worked either.

From what I can tell, both the .dba .img files reference the .caf files (with the .dba and .img files showing that there are more .caf files than I can find from extraction). This leads me to believe that the .caf files hold the actual animation data, but I'm not able to decompile them.

I can supply samples of the files for either WarFace or Evolve if someone is up to the task of looking at them.
