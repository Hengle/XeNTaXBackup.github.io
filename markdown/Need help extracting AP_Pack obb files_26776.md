- Post Title: Need help extracting AP_Pack obb files

Hello. I'm trying to extract the files for the serie of 4 games Sorcery!, which are in the format obb. 

Thanks to a Hex editor I saw that the obb was an AP_Pack, and looking for more information on internet I saw that someone on GitHub had created a specific extractor for this game: [https://github.com/flamewing/sorcery-xtractobb](https://github.com/flamewing/sorcery-xtractobb)

Unfortunately very few details are given and I don't know what I should do.

It seems to use the Android obb files of the game but someone in the Issues section confirms that it works with the obb files of the PC version of the game, and even with another game from the same developer.

If anyone could explain or point me in the right direction, I would be really grateful.

PS; I apologise in advance if my topic is not in the right place and for my bad English.
