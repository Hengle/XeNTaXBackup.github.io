Great work man!
Do you happen to have a tool to convert the textures? I see them in your example image but the script is just for the mdl I guess.

Here's Noesis plugin to open/view and convert textures. All credits goes to Chrrox   He figured out Wii U images format, I just adapted it for Monster Hunter .tex files!



Just extract all files to your Noesis folder [https://www.sendspace.com/file/8ut9rj](https://www.sendspace.com/file/8ut9rj)

Seems there might be some incorrect alpha on some textures, and many textures, like both deviljho's diffuse and one of brachydios, don't load. Normal maps for some large monsters also seem to be broken somehow, like they're the wrong size.

As for the model script, some models dont import correctly, stuff like the arm parts of armors and all of Cha Cha/Kayamba's masks.

I'll see if this fixed any issues with models that were previously unviewable.

edit: so it does import the meshes that didn't import properly before, scale/position issues still there though, at least for player/monster models

Yo, I'm having issues with extracting the models from the arc files. I'm getting files like em062_BM.241F5DEB instead of texture and model files. I'm using the arc tool that zaramot posted.

Got the data a year ago and now that I have giving a try it is very broken.
For instant here it says about use the .arc tool, but they didn't add the requirement data for let the tool recognize the game.
I try with BMS I got from other page, but it didn't extract the .mod data, which is the model, only the texture.

I have the strong feeling that we're doomed to redo work that had been done ages ago again and again.  

I used my favorite unzipper (offzip from Luigi) and my favorite, haha, lmao, hex2obj:

thanks a lot for your respond. I don't want to be anoying but how I use offzip and hex2obj , which I open in the software ? .arc or something else .Well, offzip is a tool for lazy hackers like me. I'd suggest to find the "original" MH3U Arctool, using a wayback machine for example.

Here's a parameters' example for offzip:

hex2obj? Read the link in my sig. Not a one-click-solution. You need to be familiar with hexeditors, floats and integers at least to make senseful use of it.

(I got the sword in my previous post from 0000cb25.dom, extracted by offzip from w11_100.arc.)

well I already tried to use arctool (dl via wayback machine) but it didn't work it did somme .000000 file and nothing else. So I used [ quickbms ](http://aluigi.altervista.org/quickbms.htm) with this script :

```
set HFS long 0

get SIGN long
if SIGN == 0x00534648 || SIGN == 0x48465300 # " SFH" and "HFS "
set HFS long 1
goto 0x10
callfunction GUESS_ARC 1
if OK == 0
goto 0x20000
callfunction GUESS_ARC 1
endif
if OK != 0
goto -4 0 SEEK_CUR
else
goto 0
findloc OFFSET binary "\x00CRA" 0 ""
if OFFSET == ""
findloc OFFSET binary "ARC\x00" 0 ""
if OFFSET == ""
cleanexit
endif
endif
goto OFFSET
endif
else
goto 0
endif
savepos BASE_OFF

callfunction GUESS_ARC 1
if OK == 0
cleanexit
endif
get VERSION short
endian guess16 VERSION
if VERSION == 4
comtype unzip_dynamic #zlib
print "Version:4"
elif VERSION == 8
comtype unzip_dynamic #deflate
elif VERSION == 16
print "Version:16"
comtype zlib_noerror
elif VERSION == 0x11
comtype XMemDecompress 0x8000 # yeah 0x8000 is the "magic" for RE5
print "Version:0x11"
else
comtype unzip_dynamic #zlib
print "unknown version %VERSION%, I try zlib compression"
endif
get FILES short

if VERSION == 16
get ZERO long
endif
print FILES
for i = 0 < FILES
getdstring NAME 0x40
get TYPE long
get ZSIZE long
get SIZE long
get OFFSET long

if SIZE & 0x40000000
math SIZE -= 0x40000000
endif

if HFS != 0 # used in RE5 PS3
print "HFS is long"
math ZSIZE += 32
#math SIZE /= 8
math TMP = OFFSET
math TMP /= 0x20000
math TMP *= 0x10
math ZSIZE += TMP
math SIZE += TMP
math OFFSET += TMP
math OFFSET += 2
endif

math OFFSET += BASE_OFF # needed for HFS header
set EXT extension NAME
if EXT == ""
string NAME + "."
endif
clog NAME OFFSET ZSIZE SIZE
next i

startfunction GUESS_ARC
math OK = 1
get SIGN long
if SIGN == 0x00435241 # " CRA"
#endian little
elif SIGN == 0x41524300 # "ARC "
#endian big
else
math OK = 0
endif
endfunction
```

and I ended up with tex/dom file I will try to use an hexadecimal editor to export the model . If anyone have any better alternative I will take it

Cool!   Other than offzip the bms script names the extracted files correctly.

Here's some additional information. Start of vertices is 0x408 for both extracted .dom files.
(Check for signature 075D2048 at 0x400.)

I've been trying to extract models from this game as well. While the MT frameworks script here [viewtopic.php?t=16420](https://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?t=16420) works like a charm, the Noesis plugin found here for the textures: [https://github.com/Silvris/MH-Tools-and ... ter/Noesis](https://github.com/Silvris/MH-Tools-and-Scripts/tree/master/Noesis) messes up the alpha channel. An easy fix is to paint the entire alpha channel white, since most of these don't use it either way, though one thing's been bothering me:

Why are these so small? An entire armor set barely makes up 256x256 pixels worth of texture in a game from 2013 on the Wii U. Surely I've been doing something wrong and these are somewhere in a higher size in the game's files, right?
