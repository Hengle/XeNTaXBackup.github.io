- Post Title: How to View Samurai Warriors Chronicles 3 Files

I successfully extracted the LINKDATA of the game thanks to Aluigi's script for Samurai Warriors Chronicles 3, but so far I have no luck in trying to view them in Noesis. Could someone please help me out? I uploaded a small sample right here: [link](http://www.mediafire.com/file/ygb0pnanl9ekjok/File%20Samples.zip)
