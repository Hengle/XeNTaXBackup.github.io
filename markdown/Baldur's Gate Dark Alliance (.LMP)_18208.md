- Post Title: Baldur's Gate Dark Alliance (.LMP)

I'm here because I originally tried ripping geometry and textures from this game (Baldur's Gate Dark Alliance) using Ninja Ripper, and it failed.

A comprehensive search on Google found many people have actually already unpacked Baldur's Gate Dark Alliance and are working with the models, but haven't shared their method.

The 1st post shows maps and characters being exported: (no mention of the method, but I suspect it's the same method as the next 2 links)

The 2nd and 3rd post both talk about an uncompiled scripted on GitHub, which can supposedly view and export the models...

Also, completely unrelated, but Game Extractor also claims to have compatibility with Dark Alliance, but it just unpacks the .LMP files into .ANM and .TEX files, which nothing seems to recognize.

I would really like a compiled version of the code on Github, but I can't figure out the language, and I really don't want to download any IDE's just for this 1 script.

Anyone have any ideas? I've tried using Noesis on the .LMP, .ANM, and .TEX files, but no luck.

Also, if anyone is wondering, I plan on using the models for Tabletop Simulator on steam.

Here's a sample of my work: [https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/ ... =758889359](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=758889359)

Basically, they will be pawns for DND games, so they don't need animations or bones, only mesh and texture.

I got a reply from the guy in the 1st link, and I wanted to share the information with anyone interested.

He said that he used Ninja Ripper together with Dolphin.

I already used it with PCSX2 and it didn't work, but this guy has screenshots in 3DS max of Dolphin working, so I'm going to give it a shot. Fingers crossed!

Still no idea about the BGDA-explorer program on github. I was able to find out at least that it's in C#, but I don't have a C# compiler... so anyway. That's what's up.
