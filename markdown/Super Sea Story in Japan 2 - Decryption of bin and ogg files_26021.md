- Post Title: Super Sea Story in Japan 2 - Decryption of bin and ogg files

Games affected : Pスーパー海物語 IN JAPAN2 / Super Sea Story in Japan 2
Device : Android game

In this game there are 3 files, snd.bin, snd_add.bin and sound_id.dat. Most of the audios are in snd.bin.

The files are in ogg format, the problem is every ogg extracted have encryption but only the 24 bytes after OggS (first 4 bytes of every ogg) seem encrypted.
The files included in the archive contains every ogg (albeit unplayable because of the small encryption) : [https://mega.nz/file/VRkC1bxZ#uPyeVp4ht](https://mega.nz/file/VRkC1bxZ#uPyeVp4ht) ... 3ESBFN8yrI
If somebody knows how to decrypt those bytes, thanks.
