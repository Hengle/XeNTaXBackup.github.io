Hi. I'm trying to uncompress the model and texture files from the tna impact game which uses the unreal engine. The files have a xxx extension. I've tried some of the other decompressors posted in the gears of war thread but none seem to work. 

Can anybody help opening this archive.

nope, no one was able to uncompress the xxx file. I requested it a few times on the gildor's forum but no one's interested:

I never bothered with investigating this, because the TNA game sucked, and I have already got rid of the game.  Now that we can add models to SvR2010, I can look into this, but someone needs to reupload a sample, this one is no longer available online.  Thanks.

If you could add a Christian to the list that would be awesome!  I hate Christians face in the new SvR, and yeah Brienj the game was pretty damn bad.... But the models looked great!

Ohh and we can't add models in 2010... You can lol.  I look forward to the tutorial when that day comes.  I understand you're a busy man, but the day you release that tutorial will be a legendary day indeed for Smackdown hackers everywhere lol.
