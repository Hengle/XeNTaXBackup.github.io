- Post Title: Heart of Darkness music extractor?

I'm almost sure a few years ago I saw such a program somewhere; now I finally have this game and I'd like to extract it with that program but I can't find it anywhere - can anyone remember anything like that? I've searched for a long time, but can't find anything about that program (if it even existed? I think I did see it)...
