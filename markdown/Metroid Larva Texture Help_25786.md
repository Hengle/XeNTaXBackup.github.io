- Post Title: Metroid Larva Texture Help

Hello everyone.
I have ripped the Metroid Larva Model from the game Metroid: Samus Returns and loaded it into Blender. Unfortunately, the texture for the membrane looks nothing like it does in-game. Does anybody have a node setup or something to fix that and help me?
I really hope someone can help, as I really want this fixed.

What my Metroid textures look like: [https://preview.redd.it/x6d5ms7lcqm91.p ... 24e0d9e81a](https://preview.redd.it/x6d5ms7lcqm91.png?width=399&format=png&auto=webp&s=1912e5529158a8a27458e15d8b4cf724e0d9e81a) + [https://preview.redd.it/lew3ju7lcqm91.p ... dfb67379cc](https://preview.redd.it/lew3ju7lcqm91.png?width=472&format=png&auto=webp&s=2b9ddc238a21e26d93eaaaa36e3959dfb67379cc)

Did you have a look at the uv map in blender?

Why not drag 'n drop shell_diss_00.tga onto Noesis?
