- Post Title: Can RedDeadR's RDF be extracted?

hi,masters,M a newbie.
I know that RDR have the RDF 6 format for their archives.
Someone said that we can't get the key since it don't have the PC edition.
I just wonder that if we can get the key from 3*6&0 edition's defaultxex?
Or u have any clue for this?
Thanx guys.Awesome job anyway.
