Here's a file table for a game that's encrypted.
Source code is available (C++), but after staring at it for awhile I simply can't follow it at all   

Maybe someone can look at the source and tell me how the encryption and compression works?

From the header file I guess I can see the general structure of the archive, but it's not obvious how to decrypt it.

Also, would you say the code is written well? lol I've written very little C++ code to be able to say.

btw, this is part of some fairly large model import/render/export tool so that might explain how it is designed.

The code is poorly written, yeah. There is way too much mixing of C and C++. Rolling your own memory-mapped file system? WTF what for? Just use C++ stream classes!

```

```


why not

```

```


or better yet

```

```


Also stuff like (where he reads the first 32-bit value in the data stream and xors it to get the compressed size):

```

```


is better off written in C++ using input streams. This way he doesn't have to use "spos" to keep track of the file pointer.

```
using Miletos;
using std;

// convert file data to a binary stream
stringstream stream(ios::binary);
stream << cdata << ends;

// first read operation
u32 uncompressed_size;
stream.read((char*)&uncompressed_size, sizeof(u32));
uncompressed_size ^= 0xa67f54cb;

// more read operations on data stream

```


Looks like to me all the code you need is in readTable and unpack_a67f54cb. But yeah, unless you're good at C and C++, it probably looks like gibberish to you. I didn't analyze the compression method but it looks like some kind of table lookup algorithm.

Think you could write some code to parse out the file entries?
lol then I can just focus on extracting the data.

Well, there's some missing code. The class is supposed to take two sets of data. Seeing some code where the class is used would help. What game is this for?

Db4, from illusion.

It stores data in another archive with the same name. I think that is what the other data buffer is for?
I could upload all the other code in the folder but most are for other games.

Here's the rest of the source (well, all the ones in the same folder anyways, there's a lot of source...)
Most of them are irrelevant.

I'm not sure which ones you might need lol
