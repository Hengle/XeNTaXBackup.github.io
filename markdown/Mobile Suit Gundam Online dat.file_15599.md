- Post Title: Mobile Suit Gundam Online dat.file

I've open 0000.dat in GundamOnline\data\interface\npc and 0000.dat in GundamOnline\data\interface\avatar\b with Texturefinder 2.1 and found this.
On left one is NPC and right one is player's avatar.
I don't know how to export it properly.

We need sample files to work with though.
