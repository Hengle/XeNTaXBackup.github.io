- Post Title: Specific File Size?

First off, sorry if this is the wrong section. 

So after using quickbms to export game gun sounds I want to reimport a custom sound of my own to replace the original. I tried and failed and was told that my sound needs to be the same file size as the original. Which is 8.8 KB. I tried to reduce the size with audacity but only managed to get it down to 10 KB and that doesn't work either. Any ideas on what to do? Thanks.

Try making it shorter? Or turn down the sample rate or bitrate.
