Hi there,

as I still have no idea how to get zip passwords from exe files... I once again need your help. 
This time it's "Druid Kingdom". Luckily the Trial is downloadable: [http://www.youdagames.com/en/pc-downloa ... d-kingdom/](http://www.youdagames.com/en/pc-download-games/druid-kingdom/)
Thanks your your help! 

Regards
