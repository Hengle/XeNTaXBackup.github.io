- Post Title: Inquisitor (Wooden Dragon 2009) unpacked archives

Hello everyone,

Following that post: [viewtopic.php?f=10&t=3886&p=33298&hilit ... tor#p33298](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=3886&p=33298&hilit=inquisitor#p33298)
I managed to unpack .dat archives of the game. As I plan to translate game to english, I focused on one of the files named: 01_local.dat ([http://coolish.interarena.pl/01_local.dat](http://coolish.interarena.pl/01_local.dat)) where all the text and dialogues are stored.

Archive is unpacked to main game folder as folder "Local" and original .dat is deleted. When I start the game it can use only some of the files from that folder. It correctly displays *.tga files as parts of main menu and responses to changes made to them (so it uses it for sure). 

But *.txt or *.dlg (dialogues - editable with notepad) can't be opened. Log file shows that there was an error opening file (eg. itdesc.txt). There is a path given and it is correct so the game finds the file (when I delete it, log only says there is missing text not naming missing file at all).

I already tried to unpack and delete all archives thinking maybe it should be done, but the game crashed.
I tried also with unpatched version of the game (patch adds one archive more) but there is the same problem.

Does anybody have any idea why there's an error opening some files while others work properly?

Maybe some of you know the way to assemble archive back to its previous .dat format?


I am stuck here, appreciate your help
