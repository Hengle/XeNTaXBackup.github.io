- Post Title: replace the PS2 Gta San andreas font

I want to replace the PS2 Gta San andreas font with the PC version GTA San andreas Korean font. 
I tried to solve it myself, but I can't.
Can someone please change the font for me or tell me?

After extracting the font containing the PC version GTA San Andreas Korean font as a bitmap
and putting it in PS2, it is recognized only as a white background.

Maybe you have saved it with wrong RW version or wrong platform, I don't know.
Try different settings or try to get some help on GTA modding community.
