if you have a .map file on your computer, you can try [http://allenthinks.com/grimdoomer/ambiance.html](http://allenthinks.com/grimdoomer/ambiance.html)

it freezes up on my computer though.

After testing ambiance.exe, I knew Halo2 PC version might show Error up.

How can I Read Halo2 Xbox CD with PC?
Tell me any application?


---------------------------------
I've rechecked Halo 2 folder.

*.dtz and *.map file are used for Halo 2.
(*.forge file format is for Halo 1).
