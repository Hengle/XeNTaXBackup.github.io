- Post Title: Visceral Games STR files

Hello,
I am trying to get audio files from Visceral's MySims Racing and MySims SkyHeroes. Both are using *.str archives with true .aiff audio files in, and I can't manage to extract them. In the researches I did I've found that Visceral Games are using this kind of compressed files for other of their games too, such as Dead Space, however Gibbed.Visceral.StrPack does not manage to extract these str files. Any ideas? Thanks.

One of these str files: [http://www.mediafire.com/download/d44n8 ... inmenu.str](http://www.mediafire.com/download/d44n8xwodyhot8r/mainmenu.str)
It contains 44 aiff audio files.

(I originally posted this topic in Compressed files and methods forum, but it looks a bit dead, I hope that someone here would be able to do something with str files)
