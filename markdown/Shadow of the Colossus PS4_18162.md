- Post Title: Shadow of the Colossus PS4

I have the models and texture files of Wander from Shadow of the Colossus PS4 remaster along with items and weapons, and was hoping someone could eventually take a look into it?

Looks like all the data for each file is at the footer (bottom) instead of at the header (top).
