i wrote a quick script for the ps3 version, but never completed it - [viewtopic.php?p=43513#p43513](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?p=43513#p43513)

i started writing a bms script but was having problems with arrays - the way i was looping getarray to resolve a hash in quickbms wasn't working. instead i wrote something up in delphi.

see attached. it will only work for the 360 version, and there is some error checking which needs to be done.

please test it out!
