- Post Title: Saints Row The Third Remastered [*.vpp_pc]

Saints Row The Third Remastered game was recently released. But I see nobody doing anything about this subject. Or nobody cares.

The extension of the files is in *.vpp_pc format. Previous rip tools don't work. *.vpp_pc format files should probably contain stuff like *.asm_pc or *.str2_pc.
Does anyone have any knowledge and ideas on this subject?

A small file example
cubemaps_0 [http://www.mediafire.com/file/xz50xdini ... _0.7z/file](http://www.mediafire.com/file/xz50xdinihq95wo/cubemaps_0.7z/file) 22mb
characters [https://www.mediafire.com/file/tj6jn87j ... rs.7z/file](https://www.mediafire.com/file/tj6jn87jv7dysmv/characters.7z/file)  2.1gb
Link to the game --> [https://www.epicgames.com/store/tr/prod ... dated=true](https://www.epicgames.com/store/tr/product/saints-row-the-third-remastered/home?sessionInvalidated=true)

Textures and models have been renewed.

characters.vpp_pc
cubemaps_1.vpp_pc
customize_player.vpp_pc I will upload these files later. (They are a little big in size.)

Interesting.
I think we will wait for now.

Yeah so that project is dead and the apparent fix for it someone made doesn't seem to be fully fixed either. Is no one here willing to try to crack this game? A lot of those models would seriously be worth having!

The linked above tool works fine, you just need to use compatible chrome version, which is 85. You can grab it from [portable apps](https://phoenixnap.dl.sourceforge.net/project/portableapps/Google%20Chrome%20Portable/GoogleChromePortable64_85.0.4183.102_online.paf.exe), for example. No additional fix is required, unless you want to reinvent the wheel for educational purposes. 
I don't know about meshes, but textures can be partially exported with modified [SR3UnpackTextures](https://www.saintsrowmods.com/forum/threads/a-fix-for-the-srtt-texture-unpacker-to-support-srttr.18646/) (normals are probably skipped due to unsupported compression type). All credits goes to creators, LucasRitter and Simonlsp.
