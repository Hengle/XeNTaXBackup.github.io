- Post Title: Extensionless Compressed File (Sonic Secret Rings)

I'm not sure what the compression is for this archive to extract out the files. I'm just curious as to what is inside these archives.

[http://www.sendspace.com/file/yh86hs](http://www.sendspace.com/file/yh86hs) Character File

[http://www.sendspace.com/file/4meur3](http://www.sendspace.com/file/4meur3)  Stage File

Just to have variety incase it is a bit different.

edit: Seems they are for the party files, I just checked with a memory dump in Dolphin to see if it would decompress it in there but nope. But why they would even be compressed differently I have no idea. The compression isn't like the other files. I was thinking of ripping them and the animations. But I can't even get access to the files within here. If anyone can be of assistance since I have no experience in this area.
