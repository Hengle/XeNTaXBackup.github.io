- Post Title: I need help with ARCH00 file

hello guys 
i got a new FPS online game called Run and fire it's new russian version of and old game called repulse or genesis A.D   
it has so meany versions with the same resource files   
i was managing to unpack the arch00 files that are similer to F.E.A.R resource files too but i didnt get any thing    . till i got a script based tool called quickbms    and search for the appropriate script for it and i found one sucssesfuly unpacked it     
but the main problem here is how to reimport the files that i'v edited to the original arch00 file    cuz i guess it needs a special script that unfortunately i dont own   
can someone please help me with that ??    
this is a simple file from the game
