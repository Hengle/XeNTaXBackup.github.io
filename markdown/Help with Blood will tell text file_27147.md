- Post Title: Help with Blood will tell text file

Hi guys!
I want to make a translation of the ps2 game Blood Will Tell, but I've run into difficulties with the game's text files.

From my tests I found out which file contains the texts.
But when I opened the file in the hex editor, I couldn't find any readable text.
Can anyone help me?
Sorry for the English, I use the translator.
