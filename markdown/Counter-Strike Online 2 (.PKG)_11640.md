I am not sure the new client can use it,the tool crash everytime when I read the files.I will download the old client to check it out,maybe this is my PC's problem

Update:I send the new client files to my friends,they said the tool crash too.btw,I cant download the old client in China.

Auto Decompiler Tool - Written by Kungfulon
---------------------------------------------

Copy 'CSO2Tool_AutoDec.exe' to the folder that contains 'CSO2Unp.exe' and run it. Then you can select multiple files to decompile (Max: 100 files). After Decompiling completed, a message will pop out.

Why...      

A simple batch file does the trick

```
color a
FOR /R %%a IN ("*.pkg") DO CSO2Unp "%%a"
pause

All pkgs are now can be extractex EXCEPT one: '1b87c6b551e518d11114ee21b7645a47.pkg'
But i think it's unecessary. So if you guys use 'Auto Decompile Bat' by cra0, remember to put '1b87c6b551e518d11114ee21b7645a47.pkg' to other folder otherwise the Decompile will be stuck.

The only one problem left is: some models and textures still can't be opened.

@Athener: It's not 'crash', it's console app. Check attachment, extract those files to pkgs folder and open 'CSO2_AutoDecompile.bat'

What you mean fix? Textures for example have 2 formats, normal VTF and new CO2. So there is nothing to fix!

Hmm, why can't some textures (VTF) be opened? 
Anyway, yesterday i asked my friend to port 'lighthost' player model from CSO2 to CS1.6 and he said: half of mesh was error and couldn't be ported. So i think there will be a problem with 'Model Decompiler'  (like CSO1 with Nar Tool)

Anyway, yesterday i asked my friend to port 'lighthost' player model from CSO2 to CS1.6 and he said: half of mesh was error and couldn't be ported. So i think there will be a problem with 'Model Decompiler'  (like CSO1 with Nar Tool)
Once the texture problem is fixed the model bit is easy the mdl format hasn't changed that much. I plan on porting the models to CSGO and Garry's Mod.

Can you help about player model 'lighthost' ?
I extract player model and hand 'lighthost' (models/zombie/lighthost), but when my friend ports it to CS1.6, he engages a problem: Half of model is lost


He said that he needed Zombie_lighthost_body.mdl and Zombie_lighthost_hair.mdl ,... but i when i extracted the pkgs, i have only 'zombie_lighthost.mdl'



Here is the full appearance of 'lighthost'

Well, firstly he uses 'Cannonfodder's HL2 MDLDecompiler' to decompile the mdl and then import those extracted smd files in Milk Shape 3D (as i think)

Ah alright yeah that won't work the mesh pieces are split into multiple chunks inside the mdl they aren't missing it's just the mdl decompiler failing to decompile them I'll take a look at the format soon.

I wonder if it's possible to port model from CSO2 to CS1.6 + keeping original animations 
Can you put 'lighthost' on the top of the working list. i very need it for my project soon.

Thanks for the tool, the musics are good to go and I'm using it for my mods.

I know we got problem with the VTFs, but what about the player models? I can't seem to view it in HLMV. So then I got something in my mind, can we test the models in GMod?

Whats the point in having models without textures?
I've figured out the mdl format its not much different from valve's other games but more importantly this VTF LZMA issue. I looked through the lzmadecode subroutine many times it doesn't seem unusual but is fairly different from the one from csgo.

I was implying the broken mdls (I thought it's broken because I can't open it in HLMW as I said before), specially because they're the player models which will be used prominently.
But then, if you did know they're only have texture problem, forget what I typed.

.mdl WAS KILLING MEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE

i used Decompile program, 'Crowbar'
Crowbar said 'MDL file size is different than the internally recorded expected size. MDL file was probably extracted with a bad tool.'
what is wrong?

Doesn't work for me ;_;

Are you sure that you are using the latest client version? Because i tested on different OS's and it works without problems. Also check attribute on all PKG - it's not should be - Read Only.

A bit late I know, but do the file names mean anything or are they just random characters and the engine loads everything in the Data directory.
