Hi,

This is a somewhat new F2P game, with several meshes from the World War II, I think it's very valuable and someone might be interested as well.

I have upload a nice amount of content from the game and you can download it here;

Or if you wish to get the game, it's on Steam for free: [http://store.steampowered.com/app/227940/](http://store.steampowered.com/app/227940/)

I would greatly appreciate if anyone have a look.

Thanks.

This works good with textures, but meshes are binary, don't know how to work with them.

I dumped the RAM while I was playing the game, then I analize the dumped file comparing with the file created for IntelGPA, specifically the erg in hex view, then I extract mesh by mesh with hex2obj. is a very slow process.
