And what the hell the resource files format of the games say about the engine itself? Absolutely nothing.
The forge files are compressed is nothing new to anyone and contrary to what you say, it's possible recompress/repack then.
We made of the Assassin's Creed 2 translation, unpacking the forge files and pack them again. So, almost all the things that you said on that post is a desinformation.
