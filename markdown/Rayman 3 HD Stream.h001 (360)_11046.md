Hello, I've been looking into this for awhile now and I can't find a solution anywhere.

I'm assuming by their names that they contain the game's music files and that it may actually be a split archive instead of two individual ones, I could very well be wrong though.

If anyone here could write a script/tool to extract these archives I will PM them a link to a sample of each.
