- Post Title: Would a disclaimer help?

This'll probably be the last topic I post here, depending on how things turn out, but would it help at all to put in a copyright disclaimer if someone should plan to do something like what I tried to do earlier this year? A disclaimer from someone usually tells others that that someone does not own the rights to whatever content they are using.

I think the lack of response to your posts may be due to there not being enough interest. Not everyone wants to take on everything, and especially with the recent opening of registrations, you'll be even harder pressed to find people to help. Don't take it personally.
