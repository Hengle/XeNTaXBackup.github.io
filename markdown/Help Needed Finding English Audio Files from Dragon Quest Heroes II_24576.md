- Post Title: Help Needed Finding English Audio Files from Dragon Quest Heroes II

So I'm looking for the English audio files for the characters in this game. Since the first game's audio files are already on Sound Resources site, that's specifically what I want out of this game, but I cant find them in the actual game. I've narrowed the search down extensively. The streaming vids from the cinematics are in the Sound and Sound_West folder and the GIAGANTIC Linkdata.bin folders had nothing but the game's monsters and I believe JAPANESE grunts and stuff. So I have no idea where the English ones are stored. The last place I can think are the High and Low folders that say "_En" but someone on another site isn't responding to me. Only person I saw get in, but took the files off the google drive link he had up -_- (hate when people do that)

Please help.

I'll post a link to the google drive of the files in question I think might have the English grunts or something of note; [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cVlqb4 ... sp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cVlqb49OVgF9p3bOIeyfc29n_uyi9x1L/view?usp=sharing)

Those 2 files are both .wmv videos (rename to .wmv to play), but neither seems to have any audio in them, just video - the Low folder is probably just lower res versions of these.  So your English audio must be stored elsewhere.
