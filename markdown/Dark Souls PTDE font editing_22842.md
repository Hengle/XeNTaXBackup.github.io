Hello there, I'm doing Ukrainian localization for Dark Souls PTDE and Dark Souls Remastered. How do I add a new glyphs to the font? I've extracted .dds  texture from font files, but where is information about glyphs is stored? It is in .ccm files, am I right? How do I extract them?

You can just replace existing characters in the DDS files.
