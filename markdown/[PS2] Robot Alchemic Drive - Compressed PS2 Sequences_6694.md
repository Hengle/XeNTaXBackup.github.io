- Post Title: [PS2] Robot Alchemic Drive - Compressed PS2 Sequences

I've got a file from Robot Alchemic Drive [SLUS-20445].  It appears to be an archive of standard PS2 "MIDI" sequences with some sort of compression.  With my limited knowledge it seems like some sort of LZ compression, since it has what may be the starting buffer, and then some recognizable Magic Bytes.  Any help appreciated.

EDIT: manako helped me using PCSX2 savestates.
