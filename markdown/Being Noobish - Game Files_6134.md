- Post Title: Being Noobish - Game Files

I see a lot of post in this forum for games NON PC for there files. I dont know much about console  games and there files. Im familiar with PC games and files.

Is it that you guys get the files off the console CD's and put them on the PC or do you download the files from somewhere?

Not trying to criticize anyone, just wondering how y'all do it.
