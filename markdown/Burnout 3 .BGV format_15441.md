- Post Title: Burnout 3 .BGV format

Dear forums,

 I know that a quick BMS script was written for this game sometime ago but it cannot completely decode the vehicles of this marvelous game. Bellow is a sample file for one of the cars. what is know is that some of the vertex data is in the .BGV file but what comes out of the extraction is missing a lot that should come with a full decoding. thank you for your time.
