I had this question with me which... is about model ripping the models of the cars of burnout 3 takedown, revenge and dominator, and if possibly.. tracks. i have the files of B3T (ps2) and i still don't know how the fuck in opening them, i know about the Model researcher program and i have it but.. how do i even use it? how the hex editing works? i need help in that, and about the tracks i want to know if there is a WAY to get em, like no ninjaripper or the pscx2 0.9.8 things, like for real i want to try to rip em in a way that i get the whole models in their correct position and with everything on it, still... idk if someone knows nor they know about ripping models, which i want help in this please.

(It's hard to understand, doesn't provide uvs, I guess, etc.)
And I couldn't check it with Takedown/Revenge/Dominator models because I don't have any.

Model researcher, the 3d model of this one is from the xbox 360 version and let me say, it was not easy at all, it was rough and difficult to figure out
