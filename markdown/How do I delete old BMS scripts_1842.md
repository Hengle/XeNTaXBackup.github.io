You mean from the MRF (MultiEx Resource File)?

What I mean is I installed a few BMS scripts, and wanna remove it, because they are not used anymore, not the whole MRF.  Makes sense?

Well, backup the MC.MRF file somewhere save and open it in MexBinderPlus (mexcom dir). You should be able to locate the BMS format and delete it via right-click. Then save it again, and copy it back to the config dir.
