- Post Title: Dance Central Moves

I don't know if this is the right place to post this, but i'll try.
I am trying to open Dance Central's movement files (files for the dance moves) with someone on Discord, but it won't open with Dance Central Tool. Does anybody know what should i do? I think it's on the milo_xbox file. And i'm trying to make custom DLC with someone.

EDIT: It's for Dance Central 3
EDIT3: I'm waiting for a response...
