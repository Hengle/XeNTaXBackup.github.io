- Post Title: Smackdown vs Raw 2010 CAS file Error

I just copied and pasted my original post from the Caws.ws forum:
Okay so yesterday I went online and it told me that 46 superstars needed to be uploaded to the server due to the usage of the paint-tool, but everytime it reach 9/46 it gave an error stating that their was no response from the SvR10 server. So I figured since it gets the error at 9/46 I'll just use xport to remove all of the superstars from the save and upload them 8 at a time, but now the save doesn't recognize the CAS that I'm putting back on the save through xport; it's just empty slots

Hoping to fix the problem, I tried to resign one of the CAS (create a superster) files and even the Svr10 Save file and booted up the xbox only to get this message: 



which will only allow you to continue if you select yes and ends up deleting the CAS file that was resigned .

What is needed is some way for the CAS file to be recognized on any save or vice-versa so we can bypass this message so it'll stop removing the CAS. 

If anyone has any knowledge of how to fix this please do help.

I don't see how such a major issue could be ignored........
