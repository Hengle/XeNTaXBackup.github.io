Final Fantasy XII (FFXII) maps





Usage: drop .dae.phyre file onto the tool

Diffuse textures will be applied if you have corresponding .AH files in the same folder with main file and the tool.

Important note: Supports only maps. Will crash on everything else.

More notes:
- only 1 UV pair exported
- on some rare maps materials may be wrong for a few meshes with submeshes
- faces are inverted on some objects (possibly because its remake from PS2)

Hi, how exactly did you assign the textures? And are the animations of the npcs supposed to be present in the smd file?
