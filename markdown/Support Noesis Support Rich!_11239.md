Why would I donate if he doesn't want to share any source code ?

There's plenty of native source and scripts included and on the official repo, the core is closed for a variety reasons that I've covered lots of times on these forums. If you use the program and like it, maybe you should donate. If you don't use it or hate it, then that's fine too, and I'll see you in hell.

Love,
Rich

Why does the source code matter?
