Can someone help me to decrypt Uta Macross files? Seems like game uses xor encryption but where to get the key?

Game has individual xor key for each specific file so its not like I want to know the key for one file, I want to get to know how to get those keys
I’m not sure if only samples gonna help 
Need to download entire game
