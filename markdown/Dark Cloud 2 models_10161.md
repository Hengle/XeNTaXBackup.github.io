- Post Title: Dark Cloud 2 models

So has anyone taken a look at the dark cloud models? I extracted the files from dark cloud 2 and they seem to be the same if not similar to the original games format.
I have some of what I think are the main character models from the game if anyone wants to take a look at them.
just let me know and i'll send you the link along with anything else you want from the game.

but I couldn't test the tools so far.

(wow, 4 years later; seems I'm a little bit delayed  )
