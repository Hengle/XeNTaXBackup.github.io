- Post Title: Need help extracting a Unity AssetBundle file with unknown encryption method

Game name: Vanguard Zero
File link: [https://zeroproduct.azureedge.net/produ ... du-jzzhrmW](https://zeroproduct.azureedge.net/product/assetbundles/android/ltpNeCL6yYp1du-jzzhrmW)
This file contains the list of assets needed to be downloaded from the server in order to make the game work, so I guess it should start with UnityFS...5.x.x....2019.4.2f1 like other asset files found in the game.
I'm still new to datamining from the server to know about upcoming content (to know if there are any card sets I should save my gacha spins on) as an enthusiast so please help me as they asks other miners to not publicly post their findings online anymore. I figure the best way to do this is to know the list of downloadable contents and filter out already downloaded ones, or best know from the start which to download if the file list contains their name before changing into hashes.
Any help would be appreciated!
P. S. Other readable assets the game downloads: [https://pastebin.com/VC7eYBDb](https://pastebin.com/VC7eYBDb), the above link is the only one that's encrypted!
