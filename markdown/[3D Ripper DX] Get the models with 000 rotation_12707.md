- Post Title: [3D Ripper DX] Get the models with 0/0/0 rotation

Hey there,

everytime I rip from a game the models are rotated:



How can I get the exact X=0 / Y=0 / Z=0 rotation??

Thanks in advance

Use ninjaripper instead.

Use ninjaripper instead.

But NR captures only single meshes and places them all at one point, I want to have all objects placed like the game.
