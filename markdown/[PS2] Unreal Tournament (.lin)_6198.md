- Post Title: [PS2] Unreal Tournament (*.lin)

Hi. I'm not sure if this will help you or not, but I noticed that Rune: Viking Warlord, which is also for the PS2, uses a similar file format. Offzip was able to extract "D4 7F 02 56" from Rune's common.lin, but nothing more.

[Here](http://www.sendspace.com/file/ro6deh) is the file. Maybe somebody can learn about UT's *.lin files through Rune: Viking Warlord's files.
