- Post Title: [XBLA/PSN] Girl Fight (2013) .PSSG (Samples Included)

Hi, I've looked high and low for a way to open Girl Fight's .PSSG models and the only extractor that works and extracts .PSSG to .OBJ is this one.

[viewtopic.php?f=16&t=7667](https://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=7667)

Unfortunately, it only extracts a single model and not the others. Can anyone look at these and see what the issue is, or how to extract them another way? Thanks.
