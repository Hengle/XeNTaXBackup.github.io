Yes, that would be good.
I checked, and the bytes used to XOR against are different for each file. I guess it's calculated via one or more values from the file header.

No we'd need someone that is able to unpack Themida.

As I already said the exe seems to be protected by themida. We need an unpacked exe to figure out the encryption algorithm.

What you need is not a unpacked exe. What you need is a unpacked CrySystem.dll. Also, you won't need a fully working one, what you need is to be able to read the code section. And that is pretty easy, since Themida anti codes are pretty simple.

[http://geekserv.hornycat.org/~dick/CrySystem_dumped.rar](http://geekserv.hornycat.org/~dick/CrySystem_dumped.rar)

There you go, you will have all strings, all code. Just offsets is wrong.
Im myself investigating whats been happening to the first 32bytes of the compressedData. And i can say its not a simple xor, shr, shl method.
It's a dynamic value that's been tampered with more than that.

I'll be cross checking with the orginal CrySystem to see what they've added.

Many kisses

Pretty simple? Doesn't this old version of Themida/Xtreme Protector use an aggressive ring0 driver?
And what about some tools identifying Xtreme Protector (though that one section is named Themida)?
Are both protections used?

It's easier than that, but um both Themida, and identifing near EOF you can notice what version it is, by comparing your own protected applications, you know what version you've used. Use Peid for this, and try find a cool signature Database, I hear the next version of Peid will contain loads of signatures.

It does not use any kernel driven driver, it use hooks allthough.
Which case, you wont have to bother now, since i supplied you with a decrypted code dll.

Yeah but I'm into every aspect of reverse engineering, not only game file formats 
I'm really interested in how you unpacked it. There are not much tutorials out there. I only have a spanish one, but it's hard to read it using Google translation

Hi guys,

I'm new to this forum and very curious about Aion's textures and sounds  Is there any news about how to extract the files from the *.pak files? Since I don't much about encryption and all this stuff, the only way I can help you is uploading any needed client file to get this done.

I hadn't seen this forum before (doh, hours wasted!) so I only managed to get as far as noticing it was a zip file with the header changed.  When I tried extracting with those 32 bytes different I got all sorts of exceptions so hopefully you wizards can work out whats changed (i.e. what the OP posted about).  I'm not a super programmer, but I do like ripping apart game files and their encryption (as long as they're fairly basic!).  ASM is a bit beyond me so the above code goes way over my head, but if I can get an idea of whats changed then I'll keep giving it a go

If I've made any sense of that assembly above, you'd need to know what is stored in EAX and CL, and what EBP initially points to, to make any sense of how the values are being manipulated?  Never done much debugging, but not sure how you'd inspect those without the program running?

I presume the scrambling of these 32 bytes is literally just to break the deflate routine and nothing more? If so my gut instinct is that those 32 bytes are just being encoded against a key, which I'd guess EAX points to.  Lot of guessing, but its all I've got so far

The above routine just give you a hint what to look for.

From my previous research i found that

The data is "simply" xor-ed by the pre-calculated table.
You can find the table and how it is xor-ed in Crysystem.dll.

I'm going cross-eyed looking through the .dll   What you said above was really helpful in finding the table, I just have no idea where to look to find out how it selects each entry.  Any more hints?

Edit: nevermind, think I figured it out (very sneaky!), and hopefully thats enough to find the right "key".  Getting a bit closer now!

Thanks to whoever dumped the DLL, it helped me to figure out the xor keys. I made a small converter in Python.
Edit: apparently it doesn't work with the latest client, I need a new dump of the DLL...

After a weekend spent unpacking the latest DLL (Themida is a bitch), I finally succeeded in finding the new table and xor algo. Here's an updated script which should support both versions I had access to. It checks that the data unpacks cleanly and CRC matches to detect the AION version.

rokfan, does this mean it creates a "zip" file that you can extract? But i guess the models are still some weird format that needs to be converted to?

Hi,

I am searching info on the xml files that can be found inside some pak files. Everything else unpack with success but the xml files seem to be crypted. Do you have information on this ?

Thanks for your script 
I'm new to all of this so I've got one question, how do I run this script?

When I try to run it, I get this error =o

```

Worked for me. Are you using the second version of the script? Does it fail on other .pak files too? What is your CrySystem.dll version?

When I try to run it, I get this error =o.
Code: Select allTraceback (most recent call last):

What is your Python version? I tested on 2.5 and it should work on 2.6. It will not work on 3.0.

Are you saying that we might get a hold of the meshes, textures and animations? This sounds really really good  Any idea what format the meshes are?

A version of the Crysis model format that doesn't seem to be recognised in any importers I've tried for 3DSMax or Blender.  If I recall they're mainly CGF files (Crytek).

Haven't really bothered looking into much of the Aion stuff for now, mainly due to Wotlk (damn you blizzard) and the fact the NA/EU version of Aion isn't out for months yet.   Would love to be able to use the models though

They are in .cah format ... Which I never heard 

You can already extract textures with the python script posted in this thread. Not sure bout animations, I didnt checked those.
Textures are in .DDS format, so its no problem to open/edit em.

there is an offline hack so you can enter the character select screen and rip some models. But, i cannot access weapons or other model armors and such  So, some DDS textures i already have, even specular and normals.

Hope to see some progress of this beautiful game

I use 3d VIA printscreen. It captures dx8, dx9 and opengl stuff. The bad thing is it creates flat .png files instead of .dds with alpha channel. And you always have to do some welding on the objects.

Oh, 3d via printscreen only rips to .3dxml and there is a plugin for max that imports this. A guy named KOICHISENADA posted it here in the forums last week.

Thanks for the sample, caspersus. Turns out it was just uncompressed data (I was assuming it's always compressed). Made some adjustments to handle it.

Thanks for the fast update, script works flawless now 

I managed to extract the meshes pak and it contains few types of files:

.cal file - which it seems to be an index of the animation for the respective character (in this case elyos female)
.phy files - which contain some skeleton info (bones and stuff)
.cai file - somewhat similar to psy, contains the bones names
.cgf files - which is encoded somewhat, so I dont really know what it does. btw, there is a cfg file for each hair type, accessorry typ etc.
.saf file - also encoded, I dont know what is good for 

I attached a small archive with 1 of each files if anyone is interested in looking into them:

You dhould make sure you have teh right button first  Then make sure you run in a window mode.

I looked on the net about model files. .CGF files are cryengine models. Tried an importer for max but did not work. That was a hit in the face

Still doesnt work. Running in window mode, using the default F10 for capturing. Nothing happends when I press it -.-

Edit: This proggie [http://web.axelero.hu/karpo/](http://web.axelero.hu/karpo/) can open the .cgf files  Unfortunatelly, it cannot export em (unless you buy a license) ~.~

that is cool! I did not get any textures when i tried on shugafemale.

It says on formats that it is a cryengine .cgf file. I wonder why it did not work with my importer then

Hehe awesome!  I'd even buy a license if its reasonable, though I imagine its just a matter of time before other modelling programs can open the new crytek version.

Sod it, its only 40 EUR, bit of a bargain

Actually, I think 50 bux its pretty reasonable considering you can convert over 500 3d model types with that proggie. Im thinking to buy a license =)

How did you load the texture?  When I try it gives an error it can't load it (but seems to open fine in various .dds viewers).

Copy the textures to same folder as the mesh and convert em to .jpg format  If you want transparency, save .dds as .tga

you place the .py in a folder with a archive.

then you need to go to command promt CMD and go to that folder.

now write pak2zip.py xxx.pak xxx.zip where xxx is the archive you want to turn into a zip

Only loads uncompressed .dds files. Usually, all games textures (DXT1/DXT3/DXT5) are compressed so thats why it doesnt load

Does anyone have a link to the client download that works?

edit: nevermind, got it. Nice stuff. Does anyone know how or if the .cgf files differ from those of Far Cry? I can see and convert them using 3d Object Converter, but I can't import them into max using the far cry Cryimporter. They must be pretty close.

If you look at the xml files in a hex editor all they did was pas the file with 00 on every other byte.
it is in plain text and easy to read / edit.

Currently RPGViewer doesn't support higher version than AION_Setup_0.9.0.0. You've probably installed AION_Setup_0.9.5.0.

Probably so. Though I did manage to setup that python script to work, so I did get to convert them to zip and extract them. Been going over the cgf files to try to figure out their format.

There was a bug in the script that made it not detect version properly if there were zero-sized files or folders in the zip.

I don't recall at what point the ENU.pak with un-encrypted HTML was introduced, it might have been the initial beta and done as an error, and later patches don't include it.

If there is because the files quest_q1000.html, they are in my view encrypted AES-256. At the exit to get the file in UTF-16 and, accordingly, every second byte = 0. The sequence of these zeros is exactly repeats after 256 bytes. But almost every file in a different way.

Here is an example of decoding the file ab1_1251_dynteleporter_da.html from the Euro version of Aion

Hi I was wondering if anyone has figured anything new out about these .pak files. I have been trying to extract the font files but I am new to this and am having no luck. If anyone wants any files just let me know and I will upload them wherever you want. I have the newest US Aion client. Any information is appreciated. =]

à¹Hi. Have you tried the Python code to convert pak->zip. It should be in a previously posted thread. There are only 7 pages to search.

I was wondering if someone could possibly give me some information on why the pak2zip.py does not work on all the .pak files.  I was told by one person that it does not work on .pak files containing language files.  I don't really see why this would be a problem but I would appreciate an explanation about the limitations of it and perhaps a way to get the script working again, or an easy to use command line alternative.

For an example of one it does not work with, any of the .paks in \Aion\L10N\ folder (along with many others in the data folders) do not work.

I am using Aion 1.5.0.7, the latest release of the US retail.


Thanks in advance for any replies.

I am using the version posted on page 7 (version 0.4) and still having this problem.

I am using python26 (also tested with 25) and version 0.4 of roxfan's script.
I am running on windows 7.
My Aion is version 1.5.0.7 of the US retail.

It works for some files but not all.  An example file it does not work with is \Aion\L10N\1_enu.pak

Is the 0.4 on page 7 not right? (I redownloaded it)


Also, I am using the .py file using this .bat I wrote (for easy drag-n-drop)

```
set _=%_:.pak=.zip%
cd /d %0\..
"C:\Program Files\Python26\pythonw.exe" "pak2zip.py" %1 %_%
```

however I still get the same problem when using it via an administrator command prompt.

Would you mind throwing up what you have for 0.4?  Maybe I am missing something obvious here.

I also know someone else having the exact same problem as me using version 0.4 from page 7.
If it matters, the file I get is approx 44 KB and while I can browse it with winrar (7zip gives me an error) extracting anything will give me an archive corrupted error.

I have the same Windows 7 and pak2zip works correctly with the file 1_enu.pak from client version 1.5.0.7
Only the command line is not written the path to your python, only "pak2zip.py 1_enu.pak 1_enu.zip"

So i was thinking about the same in aion, i rly hate those long lines and i want to make them more easy readable, but the problem is i don't know how it's called in aion?? Hope to see this thread updated a lot more.

And if i can ask one more question, what's the best soft for openening .xml files? I have tryed Gibbed.Aion.ConvertXml after that opening with notepad but no changes. And guys, you are doing a great job, but if you could add simple readfirst.txt file, it would be a lot easier for you guys answering my question, and for us (noob users) aswell

How did you load the texture?  When I try it gives an error it can't load it (but seems to open fine in various .dds viewers).

Copy the textures to same folder as the mesh and convert em to .jpg format  If you want transparency, save .dds as .tga

How did you pull this off? I'm using 3D Object Converter 4.40 and I can't get the texture to load. And I've tried it as a DDS, uncompressed DDS, JPG, TGA, and BMP - all in the same directory as the mesh.

Unless there is a specific button in 3D Objector Converter I am failing to see, but I'm pretty sure I tried pushing everything.

I hate to bump a thread that hasn't been replied to in weeks, but I do have a question about the extracted files.

Say I want to convert them to another format that is more compatible with standard 3D modeling software (such as 3DS Max, Maya). I've done a CGF to 3DS conversion, but when I try to load a TGA texture, which looks excellent on the CGF, it looks messed up when applied to the 3DS file.

Does anyone know a solution to this problem?
