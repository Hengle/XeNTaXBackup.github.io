- Post Title: Odd .x files

It is from illusion's "Interact play VR"

But yes, I have opened the two files and noticed one of them was nice and readable starting with xof, while the other one started with the characters "OGJM". In fact, some of them start with "OBJG", others start with "OBJF", "OBJI" ...

Seems like they store their files in a ton of formats.
