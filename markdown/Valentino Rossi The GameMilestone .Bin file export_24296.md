- Post Title: Valentino Rossi The Game/Milestone .Bin file export

Hello, I'm looking for a software to export 3d model from milestone .bin file. I found hex2obj and model researcher but it's a little bit complicated, Ninja Ripper doesn't work(no UV map). Any body have any easier method how to do that? I want to export MotoRanch track from the game.

Seems good, do you have any solid tutorial for hex2obj because the original is quite difficult to understand.
And there is Track: [https://drive.google.com/file/d/12GPUfm ... p=drivesdk](https://drive.google.com/file/d/12GPUfmfk7PCgNS9eONKtOl1INUpcmPZm/view?usp=drivesdk)

You may read through the "Extracting simple models" thread:
[viewtopic.php?f=29&t=10894](https://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=29&t=10894)

There's many FAQs answered and links to dozens of examples "how to get meshes" from different 3D formats.
