- Post Title: Persona 2 Innocent Sin PSP Voice Files

Hey! I tried ripping P2IS' voice files using a quickbms wav scanner script on the VOICEALL.bin archive which worked. I checked the files and they had a RIFF wavefmt header. Knowing this, I tried to convert them using ww2ogg but I kept getting an unknown chunk type error, even with the --full-setup command. I hope there's someone who can help me out with this.

Well, looks like I was just being stupid. Turns out the files were in atrac3. Now, there are some other BIN files which contain sound files that I would like to know how to extract. I'm talking about the SE_SOMETHING.BIN files contained in the game's cpk, which I tried to analyze through a hex editor. Unfortunately, I couldn't tell much from the header other than the repeated instances of "PPHD8" and "PPPG"
