Hello Everyone 
I am here with a new CPK File from PES 2018 Monster Patch.
The Problem is (Cpk.BMS) Cant extract this type of Cpk which i got from monster patch.
Can anybody update the cpk.bms only to extract the content of Monster_Balls.cpk?
Im sure that somebody will be able to do that.

here is the link for the file

Note: i used vgmtoolbox,Cripacked file maker and Pes next gen file manager but none of them could extract this cpk file
