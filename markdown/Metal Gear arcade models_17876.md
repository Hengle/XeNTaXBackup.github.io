- Post Title: Metal Gear arcade models

Hello, i tried to open the files for this game with the MGS4 tools available here since it's the same engine, but i can't open the .mdn from this game with the script, the same goes for texture files.
And inside the stage folders look different from the usual.
here's some samples:

Thanks for your time

there's about 9 assumed submeshes in this mdn, so you'll need a script or tool to get the whole model.
