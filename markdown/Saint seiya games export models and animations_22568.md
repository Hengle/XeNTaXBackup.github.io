- Post Title: Saint seiya games: export models and animations?

I am looking for a way to get the animations used in any of the saint seiya games (Soldier Soul, Brave soldier or even the older and mobile games). 

Got the ISO for the games, and figured out that extracting those files is fundamentally not something that is at my current level of knowledge so I am looking for some help.

The idea is to get the animations (and the models if that is possible), so I can use them in Unity3d (since there is no plan for new SS games, I wish to make a "dynasty warrior" game with those characters on my own. The only similar game made with SS characters was "Saint Seiya Senki - sanctuary", which was a very short game based on the sanctuary chapter. 

I understand that my objective is not modding a game but make a game with those assets; so I understand if you are not interested in helping. The irony of knowing how to use a 3d engine is that I know how to make a game but I do not have the knowledge to make the actual assets and animations; so it is like not knowing how to code at all

Thanks, will give it a try.
Do you know if the tool is able to export animations too or just the models? Thanks
