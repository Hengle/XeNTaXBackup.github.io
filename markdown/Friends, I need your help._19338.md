- Post Title: Friends, I need your help.

I have a game data package, this is a very old game, the developer is from China. It is an iron phoenix. The Chinese name is the Meteor Butterfly Sword. It requires an XBOX simulator, but I don't have it. Don't panic, my problem is coming.

I extracted the image file and found the directory where the model is located. There are some GM3 file extensions. I'm sure it contains the model data, I'm sorry, it's encrypted, so I need help, but I don't provide the gm3 file yet. Maybe you remember this game, you will help me.
