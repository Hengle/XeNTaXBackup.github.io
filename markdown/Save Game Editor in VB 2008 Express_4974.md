- Post Title: Save Game Editor in VB 2008 Express?

Hi all, I've recently begun to learn Visual Basic, and I was wondering, how difficult would it be to create a Save Game Editor?
I've already got all the Hex codes for the game and want to put it all together in a little GUI app if possible. 
Any suggestions on how I should go about this?

First you need to think about what you want that app to be able to do. 
Then you need to design a layout for the app, the interface you think will enable the user to achieve what you want them to achieve. 
Then you identify different functions and procedures that you will need to program, which objects are needed etc.

Visual Basic < C#

The basic steps in a designing a process are this:

1. Concept
The beginning idea.
2. Specification
Figure out the purpose of the application, needed features, what the program will require.
3. Prototype
This is where you try out different designs to see which works best. Create a Functional prototype.
4. UI Design
Create the user interface, add features that kind of stuff. Most interface functions can be
broken down into one of three categories: getting information from the user, returning information to the user, and
initiating action.
5. Prototype
Create a Interface prototype. Allows you to see how the user will be using your application and ways to streamline it.
6. Final Design
Fix things found while testing prototypes, make any changes to the application design, and build it. Then rigorously test it and try and find bugs. Here is also where you test for performance and make changes to speed things up if needed. Once bugs are found a new version will be made and then tested and repeated until no more bugs or a minimal amount of bugs are left.
