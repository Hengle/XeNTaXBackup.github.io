- Post Title: Correctly Model Swapping in Final Fantasy 12 The Zodiac Age

Can Someone Help Me? I Unpacked my Vbf and i got all the files, and i know what all the Models are but i just can't seem to swap them Properly. [http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/f ... 1297766490](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1297766490) this is how far i got trying to swap Basch's Normal Model with the Dalmascan Capatin in the beginning Model. The Game has the Same Phyre Engine as 10 Hd Remaster.
