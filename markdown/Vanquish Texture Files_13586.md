- Post Title: Vanquish Texture Files?

So I managed to rip open the Vanquish ISO with Noesis.  So far I've found all the models but I haven't been able to find the textures.  The textures seem to be in DAT format, and Noesis won't let me open them or convert them.  Any ideas on how to bypass this?  It feels like it should be similar to how Bayonetta works, but I'm not sure anymore.

There seems to be a ".dtt" format in there too.  Perhaps that's relating to the texture files?  I'm still new to the whole "exploring the archives" thing, so I'm a bit stumped with this...
