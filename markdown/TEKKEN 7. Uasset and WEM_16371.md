I to you with other question, not about that how to extract audio.
Not often, but usually in games where audio in WEM has a XML file with track names, there is no such file here. There are files Uaseet, which I think have information about the file to which they are attached. WEM files in the names are indicated by their ID number. The question is, is there any way to somehow find out what audio for ID belongs to Uaseet?
Similar met in another game, like in STYX 2 Shards of Darkness.

Also, is there anyway to convert the video files?
