- Post Title: Can someone help me with this error?

When I try to extract certain files, QuickBMS gives me this error. Is there anyway to make it stop doing that? I would be very grateful if someone could help.

In this picture I'm using the Cpk.bms script and trying to extract the Fate/EXTRA .cpk file.
