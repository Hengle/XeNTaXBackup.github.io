- Post Title: Ripping from cutscenes

Hello mates,
Does anyone know which ripping program can rip models, textures and maps from cutscenes? I did try with NinjaRipper but with no effects.

Can you explain a bit more, like what game you're trying to rip from exactly?

And what you mean by cutscenes?

If NinjaRipper can rip from the normal game but not from the cutscenes, then it means that the cutscenes are just video files, they don't contain anything other than video and audio.

Mhh, instead there is a way to add 3D models, textures or speechs into a cutscene in Cruis'n World for the N64? I want to uncensor the ending restoring the president with his voice and the models, I added the voice files in the rom but I don't know how use them. Otherwise is possibile replace the cutscene with a converted video?
