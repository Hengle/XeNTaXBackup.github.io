Hello, I was directed here and hope someone can help.  I have an old game for DOS Bill Elliott's Nascar Challenge and I really want to dig through the files and look at all the sprites in the game and anything else that I can.  As far as I know there are no tools or anything for this game out there.  I am almost positive this game is abandonware too I can't even find a place to buy it now if I wanted to.

I uploaded my install here: [https://www115.zippyshare.com/v/oqRxIXSO/file.html](https://www115.zippyshare.com/v/oqRxIXSO/file.html) in hopes that maybe some tallented person could take a look and figure out how to crack the files.  I tried asking a programming friend of mine and he opened some of the files up in a hex editor but he got lost real quick and recommended I try here so hopefully someone can help   

Any help is greatly appreciated!
