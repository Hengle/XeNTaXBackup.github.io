Hi all,

I need some help deciphering this file. I'm pretty sure it's an image file. I've gotten something resembling the world's shape with these settings in TextureFinder v2.1:

Pixel Format-> 16x4=48+16
Width = 19512
Bottom up = checked

But I think it's just luck that I got something at all.

I'd appreciate any help provided!

Thanks
