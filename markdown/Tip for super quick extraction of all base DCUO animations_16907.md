- Post Title: Tip for super quick extraction of "all" base DCUO animations

If you begin downloading the free dcuo game through Steam, which is 25gb or so, you only 
need to wait until the DCGame.upk is downloaded, maybe within the first gb. Then use 
Gildor's Umodel and scroll to the script container and inside will be DCGame.upk which has 
692 base character animations ready for export.

How do you convert the animations? I have a bunch from DCUO in UPK format, I can read the animation names from the UPK in Notepad, but Gildor's Tools doesn't open them.
