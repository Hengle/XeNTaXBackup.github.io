- Post Title: Mechassault Audio Extraction .d1Bank file (need help)

seems to be raw xbox adpcm data at 48khz stereo, the first 6 mins or so seems to decode fine but rest comes with static mess while the rest of file seems to be adpcm data as well from inspection, likely some junk in between throws off decoding... sadly no apparent header what so ever so cutting the file to find start for 2nd track is argh.

genh works fine for the 1st track in the file.
