- Post Title: Brothers - A Tale of Two Sons - How to edit Coalesced_INT.bin text file?

Hello,

I would like to decrypt modify and encrypt the Brothers - A Tale of Two Sons  Coalesced_INT.bin file (Nintendo Switch, but I saw this Coalesced_INT.bin format on PC games too).
Can you help me with that?

The file:

What is the target platform this file comes from?
I'm asking because I have this game on PC and localization file is stored in "\Brothers - A Tale of Two Sons\P13\Localization\INT" directory.
It is "P13.int" normal text file and it's not encrypted. And your sample file is completely different.
So please tell me platform and how did you obtain this file (in details) - otherwise no one will be able to help you.
