Hello there. A little info here to help You. Game has three types of text: the first will be GUI items (main menu, player menu, inventory, etc) which are images (well, packed images); the second - items descriptions, which are just plain ASCII text with some mark-up symbols; and the last - dialog text, which is basically a binary data with character width table to use with font image followed by encoded text. The encoding varies from one file to another, and depends on font image.

Fonts are stored, if I recall it correctly, as a 4bpp indexed compressed images, CLUTs for them are stored separately.

I linked a program I wrote a while ago, that is capable to extract/unpack most of the data (excluding raw sounds and background FMV movies) from *.CDF files. Just drop any of the CDFs on it. The dialog text is in files with extension "*.04", the actual width table and text in them start somewhere after "CAP2" ascii string.
