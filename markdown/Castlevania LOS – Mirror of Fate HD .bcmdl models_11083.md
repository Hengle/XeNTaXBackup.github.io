Thanks to Ekey, MOF .pkg files can be extracted, which contain models with .bcmdl extension:

[viewtopic.php?f=10&t=11080](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=11080)

I am interested in bcmdl conversion to obj, especially static meshes contained in the pkg archives extracted from the "packs" folder: 

For example: \maps\levels\c20_alucard\s000_mirror_of_fate\models

Per forum rules, please PM me for additional data.

On my PC version, there were these two large files:

data.pack
strmdata.pack

which could also be extracted with this bms script
