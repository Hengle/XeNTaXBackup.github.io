- Post Title: Ridge Racer Type 4 unknown format

Hi,
I've been trying to get the 3D car models from this game but I'm stuck.

By far I've been able to find each car file but looks like they use some type of compression algorithm. At first sight, they look similar to LZS compression, but I've no experience in this field.

If you could help I'd be very pleased, thanks.

You can find a sample below.
