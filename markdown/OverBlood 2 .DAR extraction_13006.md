- Post Title: OverBlood 2 .DAR extraction

Hello everyone, first time posting here on the forums. I was hoping someone could help me with a small problem I was having.

I wanted to extract various 3D models from a PS1 game, OverBlood 2. I know that trying to dump the data with an emulator would be pointless, due to the various problems regarding how the PS1 handles the Z-axis and the lack of a plugin that could do it (well, from what I've tried to find). I've tried to use various other tools to extract the data from the disc, since I assume this .DAR file right here is where everything is kept.



Anyway, I don't know much about the .DAR format other than it's an archive that holds game files. None of the other .DAR programs would recognize it (those being ones intended for Konami games using the format) so I don't know what to do at this point. Is anyone familiar with OB2's file layout or have any knowledge regarding the character models/textures, and maybe even the environments if possible? I would like to be able to play around with them in something like Blender (I assume there exists converters for that purpose).

Sorry for asking, I am a bit of a beginner on this sort of thing.
