- Post Title: Rise of Incarnates [PC]

Hi
Here is an importer for models from Rise of Incarnates [PC] game.
It requires Blender249 and Python26.
How use:
1.unpack importer
2.run Blender249.blend
3.in Blender Text Window press alt+p and select:
-dat - for unpacking archive  
-ldm - for import skinned models with skeleton

For needed textures use number of ldm file. Image file are below that number.

If you want models in bind pose,  change in line 5  BINDPOSEFLAG from 1 to 0.
Script is not perfect and requires a lot of work for support all models.
