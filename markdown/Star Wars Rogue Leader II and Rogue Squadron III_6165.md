Excuse me, but according to this thread: [viewtopic.php?f=32&t=12493](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=32&t=12493), iteachvader says that it isn’t extracting the sound effects from the game, which baffles me. Shouldn’t be able to do that? Or, if what he says is true, that Factor 5 had engineered the file so much that no conventional program can crack it and get the sounds to be used as .wav files.
