- Post Title: Importing Silver Case PS1 models?

So hello, I have managed to extract one .TMD from Silver Jiken for Playstation one, size is 13 kb. I want to get Tetsugoro's car model, seen for example in the ingame driving intro. I tried importing the TMD to Milkshape but it doesn't import..Also tried if Resident Evil EMD viewer would accept the file but no luck there either. I'm guessing the file is encrypted or compressed? I'm a total noob when it comes to hacky stuff so how would I go about getting the .TMD to import..
