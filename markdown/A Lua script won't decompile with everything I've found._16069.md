- Post Title: A Lua script won't decompile with everything I've found.

The header is:

> LuaQ  C   @C:/DEPOT/RELEASE/NATION_KOR/CLIENT/CLIENT/CLIENT/CLIENT_CODE.LUAC    ''

It seems that this LUA file is compiled using LUA 5.1 but it fails to decompile with every decompiler I could find. The decompiler either crashes or spits out errors.

I don't know too much about LUA files but it seems like it has a "dictionary table" at the end. Alphabets and numbers correspond with an unknown error letter.


Any help would be greatly appreciated.
