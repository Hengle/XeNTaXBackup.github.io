I did not know 7zip can open and extract data from disk images until today.

- Post Title: 7zip opens ISO's

From their [SourceForge](http://sourceforge.net/projects/sevenzip/) page: "The program supports 7z, XZ, BZIP2, GZIP, TAR, ZIP, WIM, ARJ, CAB, CHM, CPIO, CramFS, DEB, DMG, FAT, HFS, ISO, LZH, LZMA, MBR, MSI, NSIS, NTFS, RAR, RPM, SquashFS, UDF, VHD, WIM, XAR, Z." 7Zip seems to support several disk image formats, and even some file systems (FAT, HFS, NTFS...)!

PowerArchiver has native support for most popular compressed and encoded formats currently in use. All formats are fully integrated into PowerArchiver, so you can utilize all PowerArchiver tools with each of them.

    Read and write support for ZIP, ZIPX, 7-ZIP, CAB, LHA (LZH), TAR, GZIP, BZIP2, ISO (ISO9660 and UDF â€“ PRO only), BH, XXE, UUE, yENC, and MIME (Base 64)
    Read and extract support for: RAR (10% faster than WR 4.x), ARJ, ARC, ACE, MSI, NSIS, CHM, DMG, RPM, CPIO, VHD, XAR, LZMA, SquashFS, CramFS, ZOO, WIM plus ISO (ISO9660 and UDF) disc image formats
    WCX Plug-in System enables new formats and file types to be supported with a small download.

Of more general interest is [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison ... _archivers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_file_archivers). It doesn't explicitly note which archivers are open source, though (unfortunately).
