It is 32 bit raw image but partially incorrect. I don't know why - it is incorrect unpacking from game of it is game features.

Yep, you're right about the bitmaps being formatted as 32-bit. I did manage to rip them off properly using Jaeder Naub and/or TiledGGD, though, alpha included:






I'm not sure as to why it didn't turn up properly with the tool you wrote; it might be due to how it was unpacked, but idk. I think it had something to do with file offsets.
