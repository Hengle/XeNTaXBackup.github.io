Xenoblade Chronicles 2 tool version 3

Usage: drop any character file on the tool and it will load model, skeleton and export it all into ASCII
Notes:
- ASCII format will have extended info for correct bone rotations. Noesis plugin that reads them is included
- It still fails on a few models which have textures inside of main chunk






Face morph export. Will need 2nd parameter. If no parameter specified, will export only base morph (like it was before).
Examples:

xenoblade2 model 0,2

This will export face expressions with 0,2 shift, like this:



xenoblade2 model 0 - will export them all in one place

Bit late to this one, are there any plans to support the map files with this tool?

Map files are in, a few formats.
ma01a.wiidcm
ma01a.winvda
ma01a.winvhe
ma01a.wismda
ma01a.wismhd
ma01a_fl0101.wismt

The above for example are all with the same filename, so I imagine thats models, textures, animations, cloth maybe or something similar.

As it stands now, the tool crashes with all of these files, which I suppose is to be expected as its rare tools support map/stage file formats.

Late? As far as i know, less than a week ago there were only some secret tools, and people were unable to get anything from this game.

Don't know yet what exactly i will support.

Is it possible for you to make this program compatible with Xenoblade X?

I Am Sure That His Tool Is Broken, it Is Filled With Errors And When Exported, It Loses The UV 2's and 3's Over Again.

It works as it needs to for what he initially wanted to do, he doesn't need to update it to fit your needs, he will update it when he wants to (and only if he wants to)

Sounds more like user error than the tool being broken. Besides if you prefer the 3ds max tool that's fine, use it. Why make a fuss about this one not working then.

Though I understand you are having difficulties using this tool. I would suggest you clearly state what issues you are having rather than demanding the thread to be closed. Please do not tell mods what to do.

Cheers.

When it comes to the map files, there is some extra, or missing info, that is similar to the normal models. I lack the knowledge to take it further but i do know that wismda has a lot of the xbc1 chunks that the wismt but lacks the same header as it. The wismhd file has several embeded files that are basically just wimdo files as well. If map extraction could be a thing in the future, i would love to make a live wallpaper out of it for wallpaper engine.
