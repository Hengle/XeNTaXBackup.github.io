- Post Title: Disgaea Afternoon of Darkness [PSP]

Hello all XeNTax members!
First of all I want to say that I am very happy that I am found XeNTax forum in web. 
Really I was looking in internet good site about Game File Research.
Now I'll be TORTURE you guys with my sicks questions!   
So get ready!

Ok... Back to the BUSINESS...

Everyone knows the one of the greatest tactics games which is Disgaea series. 
One of them - Afternoon of Darkness I have for PSP.
One evening I though: How was that I someone translate that game into my language?
Of course without doubt I was thinking about me 

Afterwards I opened game image and serching useful files... But something surprised me!
Yes... only one file named DATA.DAT!

Without ideas how to open that file... I searching whole websites to find anserw. 	
No effect...

Last week I found XeNTaX forum... where some members wrote the same problem.

Helpful topic was
[viewtopic.php?f=10&t=2994&p=25545&hilit=Disgaea#p25545](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=2994&p=25545&hilit=Disgaea#p25545)

Everything was all right but when I preview DATA.DAT in hexeditor hopes that I find names of files etc... I found nothing useful.
And... I cant extract files from that list [http://pastebin.com/f7e0766fd](http://pastebin.com/f7e0766fd)

The most depends the files where is Dialogue, Spells, Attack scripts, graphic things like "STAGE COMPLETE".

Best wishies,
Cierpa

trust me, you don't want to do this  Pointers & FileSizes are in the middle of the executable, all in one simple block, but after that you have 19.000+ files without name, extension or subdirs. The text is tabled (unicode) and there are custom LZS compressed files and some strange LZS archive structure...my advice, work on the second episode, it's moooore simple

it's not very difficoult but you have to look for text in each of 19.000+ file..
