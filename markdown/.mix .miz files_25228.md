- Post Title: .mix .miz files

Hello I just found this kind of files, tried to open these with 3dsmax but not success, also seems that the .miz file is compressed (or encrypted) tried with offzip and got a .dat file, these one should be a mesh or a texture.   , was playing a bit with hex2obj but got nothing yet! any kind of help would be cool!.
