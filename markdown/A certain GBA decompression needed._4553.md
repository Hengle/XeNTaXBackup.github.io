- Post Title: A certain GBA decompression needed.

[http://www.sendspace.com/file/l6y5mw](http://www.sendspace.com/file/l6y5mw)

Hey guys. I was wondering if I could get someone to decompress this GBA file for me. I've tried various decompressors for LZ77 and Huffman, but either I couldn't figure out how to work them properly or they were they were the wrong method of compression. I'm aiming to rip the sprites from this game but upon opening it in a tile editor, the images are so horrendously scrambled together that no matter of offset fixing or retiling works properly. I use Tile Molester, which is ideal, as it supports GBA windows palettes and importing if the ini is edited properly. I have the game itself so I assure you I'm allowed to have the ROM file, and I'm sure it won't matter if you have it just for decompression purposes. I need it doen by friday of next week though, so hopefully we can figure something out! In the emantime I'm gonna prepare the the worst should it get to that point and it hasn't happened yet.
