Hello!

I have a problem when I translating this game: So, I translated some dialogues to Hungarian  (.INT files), but in the game it's stays english. I think the problem is in the .UPK files. Someone can help me? Thanks for advance!

Regards,
georg1136

Hello,

I know this post is very old, but I am currently trying to find how to do that, by extracting the UPK and debug some stuff.

Look forward to this topic, I'll post my findings...
