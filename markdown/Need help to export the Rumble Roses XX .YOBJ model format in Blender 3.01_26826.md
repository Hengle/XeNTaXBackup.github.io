Hi. I'm struggling to export the Rumble Roses XX .yobj model file in Blender 3.01 onward. The old script for 2.79 isn't working anymore. I'm using new script to import bone and mesh but couldn't export it properly because exported files couldn't load it back. So I need someone who're expert in blender add-on and I really appreciate someone could help me. Below is the Blender script to import RRXX .yobj model file (Rename the attached file into .py for blender script)
