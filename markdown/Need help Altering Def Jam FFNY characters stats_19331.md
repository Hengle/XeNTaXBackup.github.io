- Post Title: Need help Altering Def Jam FFNY characters stats

Hey,

So, I have been digging in DJFFNY's file and I found a file call gamecore.xml, I adjusted the numbers and it affected the gameplay but I can't understand every code listed so, I would like some expert's help also if there is a file that I don't know about that can alter specific character's stats, it would be nice to know.

I will list the gamecore.xml file, you can take a look at it, tell me what you understand from it, would be appreciated. Also if there's a way to remove RNG through the .xml file, let me know on how to do it.

It turned out that I can't list an XML file because it's not allowed but if you can help me,  it would be appreciated.
