Has anyone done any work towards figuring out the Ghostbusters 3d models? Or is anyone interested in working on it?

Indeed, a shame. Have not seen anything really that can decipher the Infernal engine models. We have archive extraction, (.pod) sound and texture conversion for this game but no love for the models (.smb)  

Anyone?
