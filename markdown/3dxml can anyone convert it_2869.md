- Post Title: 3dxml can anyone convert it?

I did some research and have come up short. Do any of you guys know how to turn a 3dxml file into something useable in max or milkshape? One guy said in a forum someplace he used python to get into a 3dxml file but I dled it and found it very confusing. I guess I could familiarize myself with the program but I just wondered if someone here had some ideas.

Many thanks

Are you talking 3D printscreen? The first 3dxml is actually gzip file, after unzip, you got 2 text file which is vey easy to read!?

By the way, where did you get the python script?

Thanks for your reply mate. The python script I cant remember where I got it I am downloading anything and everything to try and get the 3d print screen into a modeling app like max or milk. The one I have is python-2.5.1.msi ... are you after it?

About the 3dxml file I did read that you rename to zip and extract the two files a .xml and a .3dxml pops out of it. Sorry for being dumb but what do I do next? Rename to txt?

Many thanks for your help.

About the  python script, yes, I would like to tke a look at it if you don't mind!

For the text files, you can open them in any text editor, rename it or not is up to you! BuT I recommond [SciTE](http://www.scintilla.org). It suppot xml with very nice layout!

PS: do you have 3DprintScreen v1.x? Since 2.0, the format changed a bit and I have no time to spend on it anymore!

This my first post here so hi to everybody. Nice to be here. 
About 3dxml file; you can open them in Adobe Acrobat 3D and then convert them in .vrlm what is quite common format, recognizable in many applications. I tried with 3DsMax and it works. 
Hope it helps.

The script didn't work for max 9 but he wrote me and said this.


Actually, just 2 days ago I was confirming every user that my script is totally incompatible with 3dsMax below 2008.
But yesterday I've accidentally found a solution.
It will take me a few days to rewrite my script, so that it would work with 3dsMax 9.
Please tell guys on the forums that you know, that I'm going to release 3dsMax 9 compatible version in a week.
No versions below 3dsMax 9 will be supported ever, since they haven't any support for .NET Framework.
3dsMax 9 has it, but it's a little weird, so I need a few days to make it work.

I'm adding you to the list of 3dsMaxConvertXml users, to let you all know when the very next version is released.

Koichi Senada, Russia.

I will keep yer posted.

Since max9 below didn't support NetFramework(Which I hate), so there will be no chance for it to support Max8...

But I wonder why he use it, it could be decoded using purely maxscript!!! Text file anyway!

Hello everybody!
I would like to recommend using [3DVIA.com](http://3dvia.com/) website when you need to convert a 3DXML file into anything.
There you can convert it into Collada DAE, and then into nearly anything that has a support for DAE format.
Details: [3DVIA Announcement: Now supporting COLLADA .dae Downloads](http://www.3dvia.com/blog/3dvia-announcement-now-supporting-3d-dae-download/)

The feature has been removed.
It'd be great if you could develop a new convertor with obj support as well ... So we could use it with blender

Hey KoichiSenada! Thanks for the fast reply!

3dvia.com's .dae conversion feature. I was talking about that.

3dvia.com's .dae conversion feature. I was talking about that.
Please visit [3DVIA 3D Model Content Store](http://www.3dvia.com/search/) and unroll the "Models By Format" drop-down list.
There you can see both 3DXML and DAE formats.
Did you try that method of conversion?

[Upload](http://www.3dvia.com/upload) a 3D model.
There you can see, that DAE format is supported.
Take a look at [the list of supported formats](http://www.3dvia.com/help/authoring_softwares_table.php) also.

It wasn't removed, but downloading DAE files is restricted to paid accounts now.

There is a Blender 2.49 *.3dxml import plugin written in Python here:
[http://blenderartists.org/forum/showthr ... L-Importer](http://blenderartists.org/forum/showthread.php?179057-3DXML-Importer)
I couldn't get it to import anything i captured though. Maybe our in-house Blender/Python expert [Szkaradek123](http://forum.xentax.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&u=26056) could take a look at it and make modifications so it actually works.

I am sorry to hear that the conversion feature has become commercial.
But I seriously doubt that I could have enough of my spare time to work on the converter.
Though, if someone starts an open source project, I might join the development to assist with the code and ideas.

There's an update of 3dsMaxConvertXml
The current version is [2015.09.28](http://www.4shared.com/folder/emE9FiRQ/201509.html)

[2015.09.28] - support for new 3ds Max versions, using the additional system path directories instead of the older ones.
This solves the file access errors.
