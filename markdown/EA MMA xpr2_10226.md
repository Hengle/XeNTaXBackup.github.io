- Post Title: EA MMA xpr2?

Hello everyone!

Here is the diffuse and normal texture from EA Sports MMA game for Fedor Emelianenko: [http://www.mediafire.com/?a8nj6ms8c64fd4x](http://www.mediafire.com/?a8nj6ms8c64fd4x)

A view from a hex editor shows xpr2 as a possible file type, but I haven't had any luck with any xpr tools yet. If anyone can help out, I would be very thankful.

I'm sorry to bump, but I'm still hopeful that someone can help me with this. 

I also posted here: [viewtopic.php?f=16&t=5366&p=83148&hilit=ea+mma#p83148](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=5366&p=83148&hilit=ea+mma#p83148)

Thanks in advance to anyone who takes the time to look into this.
