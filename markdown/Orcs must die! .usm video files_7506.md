To play a video with scaleform you have to convert the video file into the usm format.
The scaleform video sdk comes with the tool ScaleformVideoEncoder.exe which allows converting avi files into usm format.

You didn't get me. I need .usm-> any flash, avi, or anything else which can be edited.

It seems to me that this SDK can still help you. Use a decoder if there's one or anything of sorts. Install that SDK and check if there's a means to convert a scaleform/usm movie file to avi.

VGMToolbox can extract the video and audio streams.

I see that the video demultiplexer under Stream Tools will convert a USM file into audio (*.adx) and video (*.m2v) parts, but then what?  What can convert or edit the ADX audio format?

There are some tools for PES game.
Search for PES Tools in google and you'll find them.
It can convert *.adx files to .wav

Thanks for the suggestion.  The following tools worked for me.

[VGMStream](http://hcs64.com/vgmstream.html) also works, but I found some ADX files from Crysis 2 which it would not convert.
