- Post Title: Looking for a Xenogears sprite exporter/viewer.

Hello all! The title says it all... I am looking for a exporter/viewer to export sprite models found on the Xenogears disc. Actually I've been looking for years. I have found a tool that views the levels within' Xenogears. Just not the sprites. I know most Xenogears file formats are documented. To be honest I just don't know how to code... in that area =/ any help would be GREATLY appreciated thank you.

Post up the documentation you have. Maybe someone will write one, or find one. But people probably aren't going to look into it if there's nothing to work with.

Sure 

[http://bin.mypage.sk/FILES/xeno-gears.htm](http://bin.mypage.sk/FILES/xeno-gears.htm)

also...

[http://q-gears.svn.sourceforge.net/view ... sing/xeno/](http://q-gears.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/q-gears/trunk/reversing/xeno/)

I hope this information is useful. As you can see Xenogears is quite documented. If any other information is needed, I can provide.
