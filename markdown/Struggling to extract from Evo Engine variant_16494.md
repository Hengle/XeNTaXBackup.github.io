- Post Title: Struggling to extract from Evo Engine variant

Been banging my head in frustration for days trying to figure out how to extract files from this format; I hope someone here can at least point me in the right direction.

These are standard .toc/.cache files from Digital Extremes but they've updated the format enough that the EvolutionUnpacker tool can't pull files correctly. I've tried using various QuickBMS scripts designed for the engine, but consistently run into algorithm problems.

If I'm using signsrch correctly, the files now use comtype dmc2 but I've hit a dead end — either "the data is bigger than the allocated buffer" or "error! out of data".

Sample files: [B.Font.cache](https://ufile.io/lm2nl) • [B.Font.toc](https://ufile.io/pwrz7)

Any assistance here is most appreciated. I'm new to disassembly, but would love to be nudged in the right direction.
