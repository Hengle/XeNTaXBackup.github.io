I'd like to be able to convert the .zrs files to get the models from the Wii version of Planet 51 such as characters because these 3D models haven't been extractable yet.

The sample models are in the attachment below.

Bumping so the person can answer it when it's done making the script.

That's what I have for now. Noesis goes somewhat crazy but if static models are all you need, it should work.
