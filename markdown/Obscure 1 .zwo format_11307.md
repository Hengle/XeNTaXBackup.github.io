- Post Title: Obscure 1 *.zwo format

I have extracted obscure *.hvp files with gameextractor basic version ([http://www.watto.org/extract/download.html](http://www.watto.org/extract/download.html))
I found *.zwo files which seems to be mesh and texture files.

Anybody can analize the format?

Sample can be downloaded from below.

Well I have noticed that if you don't have 4shared.com free registered id then it is very hard to download the file. So here is another link.

Sorry for your inconvenience.

Know this is incredibly late to the party but Ive been ripping the HVP files from Obscure lately and wanted to reboot the discussion.

Im curious to try and import some of the zwo files into GoDot or another engine and see what happens.. just happy that HVP format is a straightforward rip
