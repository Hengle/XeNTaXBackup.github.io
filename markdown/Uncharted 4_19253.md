Hello. Did someone try to extract the voice files from Uncharted 4? I'm really interested in getting the multiplayer banter. There is a problem I come into though. I've found what I believe is the file that contains the voice files, "english.psarc", but when I try to extract it with a psarc extractor I only get a bunch of nonsense-named files of no specific type. This is how the files look: 




I've tried opening other .psarc files from the game and it seems they get extracted all right. Could anyone help me?

Because they have hash as names, that's how they are, its normal, they are Sony's ATRAC9 if I remember correctly, then you simply add an .at3 or .at9 extension and foobar2000/vgmstream will play/convert them fine.
Or are they .xvag, I forgot, either way try it.

Thank you  I can now convert it. The problem I come into though is that instead of sound all that is audible is noise

Nevermind, Foobar2000 deals with these files, unlike vgmstream. Again, thank you, mono24 for your help.
