Have you tried rrunpack, it usually uncompresses the ps2 smackdown oac files without any problems.

thnx but im not trying to unpack anything. i was merely looking to try to figure out the structure of the file to get an understanding of how it is constructed. ive figured out that the first two bytes after the filenames determines the start of the file but the two bytes after that seem to be random within a +/-8 byte value range when compared to the actual size but is somehow related to the file size, e.g. size of the rock's first file 540,000 - value in directy is 53F (difference of 1), size of rocks second file 730,000 - value is 72D (difference of 3). the 2 bytes that come after "EMD " are related to the size/start-stop of the directory. im sure whoever created that unpacker or understands it could help me out...
