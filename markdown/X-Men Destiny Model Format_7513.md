- Post Title: X-Men Destiny Model Format

I ripped the iso of X-Men Destiny and got a few file formats, I dont know whether to add any samples yet since I dont know which ones hold the models and textures so here are the file formats:

USM
ZZZ (All held in a WinRAR package)
G43 (Also in WinRAR Package, plus many other like G26, G00, G03  ect.)
XMA
BNK
PLX (In Cinematic folder)

But on the names of the RAR's I found one named "02_04_pow_cyclops.zzz" and another one called "02_04_pow_cyclops_tex.zzz" So im wondering if the model and textures are in different ZZZ files.

I hope someone knows if any of those is model and texture files, if not I will provide some samples to see which one is which

model format is a real pain and the models are not that good a quality.
the compression was just zlib.

Can you give more information?

I'm not good at programming, I'm trying to understand the logic files "too human."

Sorry for the "necrobump".
