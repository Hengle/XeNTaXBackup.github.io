Hi
gfx is scaleform graphic files.They are simple swf files.
try to hex edit first 3 bytes to CWS and change the extension to swf and you can see them as flash files.
Of course you can see them by GFXMediaPlayer if you have Scaleform SDK.

It's really a simple task  
anyway it doesn't take much time.
