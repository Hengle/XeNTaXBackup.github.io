- Post Title: [PS3] EdgeZlib / SDAT - Need help!

Hi,

I recently discovered this file called 'SHARC' on my PS3 for a game. I wonder if anyone here can help me decompressing it? I am suspecting that its "EdgeZlib" but I have no idea what to do. I've found some keys, if they are required.

I really need help, i basically want to be able to decompress and copress it back so I can modify this game. I am not sure if this is a game modding communiy or just research.

I have honestly no idea what to do with this file, or how to decompress it. Help would be really wanted, I might be able to offer a donation aswell in exchange if success.
