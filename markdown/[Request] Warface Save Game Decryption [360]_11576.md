- Post Title: [Request] Warface Save Game Decryption [360]

Hi I need help decrypting the save games, problem is I don't have a dev kit so I can't look into how they are encrypting the save data, it's probably similar to other CryEngine games ie, Crysis2/3.

They will be just raw XML files when decrypted...

Any ideas?
