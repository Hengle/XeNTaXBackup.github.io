I have Finally got around to looking into this games Demo files which are all .SPK but, I could not find any scripts to unpack them.

I tried using an QuickBMS script for .spk from chrrox although it did not work and is most likely for a different game.

Are the Demo game files a different format than the original game files, and if not are there any scripts here to unpack them?

I don't know about the demo, but I extracted the retail SPKs just fine with 7-Zip
