I do believe the archive is compressed, but a friend of mine is looking for the model of Rinne from this game. This place is sorta my last hope: I tried other places and solutions but nothing is helping.

I'd really appreciate any help.

TFA.

Hello. My findings: 1) libJourney.so contains references to this file. Looking in decompiler, it seem to use cipher. 2) Earlier versions have: -2 more libs in assets\com.smrtbeat\%proc%\libSmartBeat[OpenGL]Ndk.so.bin. -jsr305_annotations. Don't see much use, tho. 3) There's BDEF communities in reddit and discord - people were digging in files here, but without much results. There's also zenhax forum.

You'll have to explain to me what cipher even is lol.

Anyway, I gave up on this, I think. Unless someone has a more..... "pertinent?" solution? (no disrespect intended to the person who posted)

If you manage to find a full game install or close to one I'll take a look at it. Otherwise there isn't much else that can be done.
