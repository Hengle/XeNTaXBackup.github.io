- Post Title: Help with Otogi: Myth of Demons assets extraction

Hello, guys.  Has anyone tried to extract assets from Otogi: Myth of Demons/Otogi 2: Immortal Warriors? I am specifically interested in models and textures of locations/characters. The file system of the game is similar to Dark Souls, only the asset formats differ. Can someone with C# knowledge write an extractor using this library? [https://github.com/JKAnderson/SoulsFormats](https://github.com/JKAnderson/SoulsFormats) According to its creator, this library can help, because it supports to some extent old games From Software. If there are no altruists among you guys, then tell me the price you want for creating such a tool. Thanks for attention.

This is the second time people have ignored my posts... Are there really no knowledgeable people here?

These are the first posts you've made, unless you've been changing your name.  Also, offering money isn't allowed either.

Maybe keep an eye on this thread - zaykho is working on it:

Hello. Thank you very much, good man!
Sorry, I didn't know about the money. I deleted my first post because I didn't find a response.
By the way, maybe you can help me with my first question that I deleted? Can you tell me if there was a topic on the forum that explains how to extract textures from a game with PS Vita-Soul Sacrifice Delta?
