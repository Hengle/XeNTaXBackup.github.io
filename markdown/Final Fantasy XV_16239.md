Hello, I've been wondering how is it possible to get the FFXV rom?
I've thought that PS4 games couldn't be dumped but since I saw there were XV plugins included in the noesis update I've decided I'd ask here

All games load modeling into RAM
We need to hook it up.
In the case of a console, a hacktool is required.
Sony's security is so tight that hacking tools can be a criminal offense.
It seems possible, but we can not have it.
