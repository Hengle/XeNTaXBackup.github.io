- Post Title: Infogrames/ Spiralhouse Silver (1999) .sct files

This game is one of my fav childhood games so as a first reversing project I decided to try working on reversing the game's .sct files (level scripting files).

Here's the project on github if anyone is interested in using it/ helping out
