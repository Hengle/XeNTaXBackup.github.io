- Post Title: Request: Captain Engelhorn 3d model

Guys, do you have the Captain Engelhorn model from Peter Jackson's King Kong? Because tosyk, the guy who has that model, is not responding when I asked about it. 
Anyone who provides me with the link will be much appreciated.
Much better if it's in .obj format.
Thanks.
