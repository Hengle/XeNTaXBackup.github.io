- Post Title: Help with Basara 4 animation extracting!

I used MT Framework tool and got the models of Basara 4 (a bunch of arc and tex files). Now I can import these files into 3d max and view the model. However, I am still confused about animation extraction. 
I guess that all the animation is stored in pl000_99.kht, which is located in actorParam/pl000. Those anyone knows how to extract this kht file or the correct way of extracting and viewing the animation of Basara 4?
