Well, you're gonna be disappointed, it's 22050 Hz.
rayman3_unpack 0.0: [http://hcs64.com/files/rayman3_unpack00.zip](http://hcs64.com/files/rayman3_unpack00.zip)
extracts standard GC DSP files, _L and _R pairs for stereo.

It's just solidly packed GC DSP, standard headers.  Stereo has two headers followed by the channels interleaved at the frame level (8 bytes).  Some of the files are kind of misbuilt and won't play on vgmstream as the checks don't pass.
