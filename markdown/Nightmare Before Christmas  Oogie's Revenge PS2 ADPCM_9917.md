- Post Title: Nightmare Before Christmas : Oogie's Revenge PS2 ADPCM

So I've been trying to get these files to play correctly in either vgmstream or adpcm player but neither work. I've also tried Alpha23's ss2 re-interleave/header adding scripts but to no avail.

So here's a sample of what I'm trying to work with, straight from the archive: [http://www.mediafire.com/download.php?tin0qw24w44qarn](http://www.mediafire.com/download.php?tin0qw24w44qarn)

It's 4 channels and interleave 10, works fine with Alpha's func_header_SS2 script.

Aha! That must have been what I was doing wrong, I just assumed it was only 2 channels. Thank you sir.
