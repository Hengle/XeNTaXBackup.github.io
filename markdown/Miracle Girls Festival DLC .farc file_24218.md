- Post Title: Miracle Girls Festival DLC .farc file

I've got a DLC for Miracle Girls Festival that I would like to extract the models from, however the .farc quickbms script([https://aluigi.altervista.org/bms/virtua_fighter_5.bms](https://aluigi.altervista.org/bms/virtua_fighter_5.bms)) I used to extract the .farc files from on the base game do not appear to be working on these DLC farc files. So I'm just going to leave the files here in hopes that someone more intelligent than me can find a way to extract them  


error I get from trying to extract using the script above mentioned

Those files are completely encrypted. It's an additional protection from the game side or rather improper extraction from the source (Vita).
