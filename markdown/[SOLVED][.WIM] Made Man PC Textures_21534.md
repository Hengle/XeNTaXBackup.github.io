- Post Title: [SOLVED][.WIM] Made Man PC Textures

Hello guys, I need some help to understand the format of Made Man game textures, it's extension is .WIM.
Here is what I found so far, it looks like it's not complicated, but I'm still a baby on file format reverse engineer...

Game uses RENDERWARE Engine.



File from the example:
[https://www.mediafire.com/file/9io1amaj ... N.WIM/file](https://www.mediafire.com/file/9io1amajzdzzxej/PARTICLES_COIN.WIM/file)

Any help is welcome, thanks!
