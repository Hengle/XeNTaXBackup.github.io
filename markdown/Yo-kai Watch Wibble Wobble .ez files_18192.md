- Post Title: Yo-kai Watch Wibble Wobble .ez files

Since the servers for this game officially shut down, I wanted to see if it's possible to rip models from this game, hopefully with their rigging in-tact. I've managed to archive the majority of it, but need help figuring out where to go from here.

RandomTBush is open to writing an importer for these files, but as he said himself, they're encrypted at the moment. I would appreciate it if someone could be able to decrypt these files, and be able to work with them.

I've provided some sample files to work with. Let me know if anything else is needed. Thanks!

Not really.
For what I investigate, the model data is on the source page of the game. In a simple way of explain it: the model are download while you play and erased after you exit the app.

So you can't find them in the game files? But that makes no sense to me.

I have come back to this game data and I didn't expected that I was the last one to reply on this thread a year ago.
Because the first post erase the Samples data I decide to update some Samples my self. The ones I have .rar are just 3 of the data the game usually have, which are the .ez data, .ayd data and an image ".dat" that if it is open in either hex or Notepad it show that it is actually a .png, but probably encrypted or turned to .dat
Here is a Sample of each data type (one of each):

[https://mega.nz/file/0PMwFJSJ#r5dzzcsmU ... ChrsMw3dS8](https://mega.nz/file/0PMwFJSJ#r5dzzcsmUS4o1lDimOElYOSvpxmoJTaTCChrsMw3dS8)

I highly doubt the game store 3D data on they web, as the biggest data of the game are the folder "youkai" which is around 1gb of size. this remembering the models are very simple in term of polygons, it makes even more clear that they is 3D data in the .ez or .ayd (either one is 3D data and the other animation).
If anyone want to take a look at the data I highly appreciated.
