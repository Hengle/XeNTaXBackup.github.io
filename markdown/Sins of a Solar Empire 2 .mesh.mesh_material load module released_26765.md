- Post Title: Sins of a Solar Empire 2 *.mesh/*.mesh_material load module released

I finished my Sins of a Solar Empire 2	*.mesh/*.mesh_material load module.

I have released the following program:
- 3D Object Converter v10.010 (Windows)

How to get the 3D Object Converter v10.010:
Download the 3D Object Converter from [ http://3doc.i3dconverter.com](http://3doc.i3dconverter.com) and install it or download and use the portable version (if you don’t have it yet).
(Or just use the Help/Check for updates... function to get the v10.010.)

I recommend to copy the *.mesh and the *.mesh_material files into one folder.

The .mesh load module gets the texture file names automatically, because
- the .mesh file has external references to the .mesh_material files.
- the .mesh_material file contains the texture file names.


I have converted the DXT10 coded .dds files to .png format used the ImageMagick application from [https://imagemagick.org](https://imagemagick.org)

Download link:

Usage:
magick image.dds image.png

Thanks for the downloading link, if I face any problems, I will message you. When I was looking for a solution online, I came across [https://casinosanalyzer.com/casino-bonu ... sports.com](https://casinosanalyzer.com/casino-bonuses/boylesports.com), which helped me find online casino sites where I may make a lot of money easily by getting Boylesports promo code where you can play many games. that's why I became interested in this website because I am having financial difficulties.
