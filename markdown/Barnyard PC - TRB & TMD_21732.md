- Post Title: Barnyard PC - TRB & TMD

Barnyard uses TRB for models (animation) and data, the file format used by a lot of Blue Tongue Entertainment-games (That use the TOSHI Engine).
After using a De Blob QuickBMS-script on it, I got a TMD-file, and I cannot find a converter of any sort.
Has anyone cracked this file or know how to decompile them? I know you have already discussed De Blob here, which uses the same file formats, but I believe it uses a newer version, as the programs given here didn't work for them.

Here is a sample file from the game-files: [https://www.dropbox.com/s/5qqys9okqvglk ... e.trb?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/5qqys9okqvglkwa/americanF_Statue.trb?dl=0) (use da blob quickbms script on it to get tmd file)

Thanks.

Woah! What method did you use to make it work, even with textures?
