- Post Title: Extract Under a Killing Moon & The Pandora Directive *.ap?

Hi there good ppl!

Long time reader, first time poster.

It has long been a dream of mine to convert the video from the Tex Murphy games Under a Killing Moon and The Pandora Directive.
While Overseer used regular smackers and mpeg2 video, these two games use a proprietary format made by Access Software Inc. Inhouse.
From what I can tell, the compression seems fairly simplistic, but unfortunately, that is where my programming knowledge leaves me. 
The extension used is *.ap and the files contain a header->audio stream->video chunk(at least that's what I think).

Is anybody able to help out with this or at least point me in the right direction?

Thanks in advance!
