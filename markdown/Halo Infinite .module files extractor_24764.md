- Post Title: Halo Infinite .module files extractor

Here is a working python script for halo infinites module files. It will extract the games assets in the form of tags.

[https://github.com/matty45/HIMU](https://github.com/matty45/HIMU)

Just change the paths inside the unpacker script to the paths of your choosing and then run the script (python unpacker.py).

Some modules require files that are currently stripped from the game but will still extract, with some files missing (module_hd1 files).

Credit to MontagueM for the original extractor, i just made a hacky fix for it to work with the latest build.
