- Post Title: Req Force Unleashed DLC character files

I've been doing research on how to extract the gto files from the dlc lp.wad files and have a script that only extracts the first section of the file. Here is a link to a sample file with the quickbms script and other files I found in the dlc archive.

here are some screen shots of the section of the file with the gto data in hex editor

I think the script just needs to be updated to continue moving forward in the file. Anyone have any thoughts or ideas?
