- Post Title: Borderlands 3 Pak Files!!!

Hi all,

Anyone tried extracting the Borderlands 3 pak assets yet?

Here's the encryption key for anyone who wants to have a poke around:

0x115EE4F8C625C792F37A503308048E79726E512F0BF8D2AD7C4C87BC5947CBA7

I haven't managed extract any models/textures from UEViewer yet though.

I can only extract the .uasset and .umap files, but can't seem to import them into any version of Unreal Editor to view them
