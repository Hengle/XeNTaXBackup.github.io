DEMUL 0.7a is running Initial D ver.3.
I want to extract the images of the wheels and stickers of the cars that appear in the game.
I have a CHD file and a ROM file and let me know which one I need to analyze.

We know that CHD files are compressed. But I can not open it. Find someone who can extract the wheels and stickers of the initial D ver.3 model. Any advice is good. Please teach me.
