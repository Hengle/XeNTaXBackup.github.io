Hi
Here is my old importer for models from The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing [PC] game.
I changed some things and now support  Deathtrap [PC] game too.
It requires Blender249 and Python26.
How use:
1.unpack importer
2.run Blender249.blend
3.in Blender Text Window press alt+p and select:
-n2pk - for unpacking archive with models and textures 
-vhm - for import textured models with skeleton

If you want models in T-pose in line 5 change: BINDPOSEFLAG from 1 to 0.
Script is not perfect and requires a lot of work for support all models. 

Deathtrap sample

Yes, he absolutely will get a software he does not use, completely rewrite the script, test and fix all issues just so you can use it. lol

Serious though, Waste 30 min of your life getting blender and following simples instructions. It is easy.

By the way, excelent work Szkaradek123!
You are for sure one of the most helpful here.

This script doesn't work, I installed Blender 2.49, and Python 2.6.6 as required, associated the blend file with Blender, and ran it. It gave me an error message:

[Window Title]
E:\Documents\Game Tools\Inquisitor Martyr\Blender249[Deathtrap][PC][n2pk][vhm][2015-02-07]\Blender249.blend

[Content]
E:\Documents\Game Tools\Inquisitor Martyr\Blender249[Deathtrap][PC][n2pk][vhm][2015-02-07]\Blender249.blend

The application has failed to start because its side-by-side configuration is incorrect. Please see the application event log or use the command-line sxstrace.exe tool for more detail.


[OK]
