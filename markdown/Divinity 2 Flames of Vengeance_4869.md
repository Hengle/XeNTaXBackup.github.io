No, there is no english text for dialogs.

===================

A bit of offtopic btw, can anyone help me to trun english saves into german one's? Plain changing of one registry enrty forces the game to not just use diff laguage files, but do not understand the previous saves as well.

Anyway, here is sample saves:
<[one with german language](http://www.sendspace.com/file/kxm5gx)>
<[one with english language](http://www.sendspace.com/file/694q7q)>

Same version, same game position and status, almost the same time (withing few mins).

If someone could look @ them and tell me what's the key difference between them it would be nice :3 i just need to know which few bytes are responsible for the "language mark"

If you changed a line and this one continue appearing in german, it means the game take the phrase from another place. Try with simple words like Load, Save and Exit. Many times, some phrases are duplicated. There is no way, if you change all lines of one word (Load, for example) the game have to show the text you wrote.. or show some error due to language protection (not usually). It's mathematic.
