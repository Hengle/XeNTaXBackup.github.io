I can't even extract a single file even when using the 0.1.1 script for the 360 version.

I get "Error: Impossible to write -1779671659 bytes (total -1779671659), check your disk space."

Even though the hard drive has over 1TB of free space -_-

upload the bin file which gives the problem so that I can take a look at it.
I'm still working on the scripts for the Eurocom games so it's ok :)

ok done, I have just updated the script.

the problem was simply that also the rc4 encryption is related to the endianess, that was the cause

Seems a lot of the audio is in the filecom.000 archive.

For the 360 version, I don't think it's XMA though. It might be using Eurocom IMA ADPCM.

VGMstream only supports the Wii version.

All the platforms have the same quality audio because it's the same codec: Eurocom IMA ADPCM.

EDIT: I'm curious to know what video files this game has. Because as far as I can tell it doesn't use THP.
