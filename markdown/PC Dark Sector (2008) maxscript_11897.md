Hi guys! Here's maxscript to import Dark Sector models with bones (3ds max 2009-2012)

1. Load DSector_Bones.ms
2. Point it to a H.misc.cache file like Nadia_skel.x.1
3. A new dialogue shows up, this time choose Nadia_skel.x.1 in B.misc.cache
Bones will be loaded

4. Load DSector_Models.ms
5. Point it to H.misc.cache file Nadia_skel.x.1
6. A new dialogue shows up, this time choose Nadia_skel.x.1 in B.misc.cache
Model will be loaded above bones

Done

zaramot, is there a way to import some non-.skel.x.1 objects? like [attached one](http://www.mediafire.com/download/w3c7dzqw9lgdztt/AD.7z) (ADShades.x.1)

Yeah, it's possible. They appears to be some sort of "collision" meshes (or maybe some static things like parts of armor, weapons etc.) But they could be imported, just need to write new script
