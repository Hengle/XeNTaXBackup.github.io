- Post Title: Maya 2014 crashes when exporting using Riot File Translator

Hey guys, I'm new to this forum so bare with me if I'm doing something wrong  . I've had an issue recently with Maya 2014 where when I go to export as "League of Legends - export skin", my Maya crashes immediately.  The worst part is it doesn't have an error message so I have no clue what's wrong  . I get an error sometimes when selecting influence to paint the skin weights, but it still lets me paint the weights so I don't know what the problem is or if that's what is causing this.  The error for that is: 
// Error: file: C:/Program Files/Autodesk/Maya2014/scripts/others/artAttrSkinCallback.mel line 227: Object '' not found. //
There's more to it, but it is pretty hefty and way to much to put here, this is just the main error line. If you could use the rest of it to look more in depth let me know.

ï»¿I can still export it as a Maya Binary or MA file so I think it might be the plugin, but I tried replacing the plugin and it did the same thing so I'm not sure.

I tried fooling around with deleting some bones too in case there were too many and it still didn't work, but I'm gonna put the three different files so hopefully one of them will work (one is ma and the other two are Maya Binary). Apparently I can't attach ma or mb files so here are the links to my dropbox (I was trying to make an infernal Lux):

And if anyone can fix this, be my guest and use it for whatever the hell you want. It took me 16 hours total that I don't want to be a waste so I just want it fixed. Although I just started using 3d modeling so this will probably look pretty crude to the experienced Maya user.  Thank you to all who look into it, whether you can help me or not.

EDIT: spelling, grammar, and minor additions
