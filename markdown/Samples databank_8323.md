- Post Title: Samples databank

Do we have something like this lying around somewhere?
This idea has probably occurred from time to time.

It's typically difficult to get a legitimate copy of some product for various reasons
-budget constraints. Obvious.
-technical constraints. Don't know how to get the resources out.
-time constraints. Maybe. 
etc

It would probably be a great target for legal authorities if they found out that samples resources for large amounts of copyright material were all hosted in one location.

But aside from that, having to maintain one would also be quite difficult.
If only a group of people were given access to decide what goes in and what goes out of the databank, it obviously is not sustainable since most of us probably don't have that kind of time on our hands.

However we can't just let anyone do whatever they want either, cause that just leads to all sorts of risks.

What would be the best way to materialize such an idea, given all of the various issues that need to be addressed?
