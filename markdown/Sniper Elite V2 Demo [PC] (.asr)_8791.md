So, the demo has been released for PC and i have downloaded it thru' Steam and as i see the game is using Asura Engine as Sniper Elite 1 but heavily modified. The game's files (especially the text files again are .asr), so aluigi, if you are reading this, can you do something about script for QuickBMS because i know that you have created the script for unpacking/packing the files for Sniper Elite?

If someone want to send him a sample file, PM me. I cannot give links here because the new rules!

Both extractors crash when I try to open the "TheBlob.PC_textures" file which contains nearly all textures for the game.
The extractor from Terry Butler extracts atleast a part of the file.
