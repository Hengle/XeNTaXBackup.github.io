- Post Title: [Xbox 360] Dead Space 2 (*.viv)

There are 2 files for this game, bigfile0.viv, and bigfile1.viv. The problem is they are too big to upload   . So I uploaded the header of bigfile0.viv (all the data before the start of the first file), and then 0x40000 bytes after the header.

can you check if this script works also with this game?
[viewtopic.php?p=35143#p35143](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?p=35143#p35143)

if it works and you don't like the names replace:
log NAME_CRC OFFSET SIZE
with:
log "" OFFSET SIZE
