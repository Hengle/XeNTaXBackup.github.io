- Post Title: Noesis support for NDS nmdp 3D Models

Hi

I've seen that Noesis already supports the 3D Models from FFIII on the PSP as its file format is .gmo and several square Enix games use this same format on the PSP, however on the Nintendo DS these games use a format called .NMDP, Square uses this for several FF and FF related titles on the NDS, and it appears as though the format doesn't change at all between games.

I've extracted them from the LZSS compression and have the bare .nmdp file here, I've compared the nds extracted file with the exact same file from the PSP version to see how similar the formats are, and from my not so great guesswork, the format isn't too different all the file naming is the same inside, and neither appears to be compressed at all.

Below is a screenshot comparing the 2 formats, there are some differences but also a few similarities.

Am I the only one interested in this?

Four Games I know use this same method are Final Fantasy III, Final Fantasy IV and Final Fantasy 4 Heroes of Light, Chocobo & The Magic Picture Book.

Those are the 3 games I can confirm use the same format but I'm sure there are several other games, most likely all Square Enix too.

I know they have tools for DS sprites and stuff. No support for 3D models yet?

The specs are all over the internet, wouldn't take someone much effort to make a Noesis plugin. I might do it myself at some point since I'd like it done right with anim support. But it's not anywhere soon on my todo list.

Last time I played around with Tinke it didn't have support for 3D models.

Well, if it was NDS, they are opengl based engine, so opengl ripper work great with it, someone should try it out. Unless you can convert to nsbmd, it make everything easier/.

Actually, OpenGL Rippers don't work with any NDS Emulators, not entirely sure why, they all seem to use their own directdraw instead of OpenGL, with most crashing when you switch to OpenGL.

Tinke in the end does open Final Fantasy 4 Heroes of Light 3D Models and textures, but doesn't work on FF4 at all.

Well, to name a few, nocashgba desume, ensata, dualis, DuoS DSEMU, iDeaS, DraStic,

Check out the desume and DuoS ,DraStic, they are most anticipated to date, I think they are either opengl or dx8, well, that is all.

I wish it were so simple. I suppose u never tried to rip 3d models from Nds games using one of the various 3d rippers on the web. 

Anyway i can tell u that none of them works fine with the 3d ripper tools (directx or opengl) for my experience, but i may be wrong.

Its been quite a while now, and nobody seems interested in the format, so I dug a littlemore and managed to find this:

[https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/779 ... 00.nmdp.lz](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/7797280/t00_00.nmdp.lz)

I can open the file perfectly fine in Tinke, however it has no export option. The file doesn't look compressed, tinke just seems to export things with .lz if the compression it was previously in is lz.

Its a tiny low poly town, I have all the textures for it separately.

if so, how did you do this?

> however it has no export option.use nsbmd.exe to export as obj (without uvs):

It doesn't open the file on its own, because it needs the texture too, its openable from the ROM file structure itself with no problem, its only because now I exported it it can't find the textures and gives an error 'cannot find textures', inside the rom all the nessesary information Tinke looks for is where the file says it is, its only once exported I assume the texture connections are lost.

Tinke displays the model mesh yes, complete with UVS.

Heres a snapshot of it in Tinke 

The reason I'm avoiding using the exe you mentioned is simply lack of textures.
