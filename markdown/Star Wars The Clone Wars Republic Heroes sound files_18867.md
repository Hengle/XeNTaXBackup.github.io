- Post Title: Star Wars The Clone Wars: Republic Heroes sound files

Okay, so I managed to extract the files from Star Wars The Clone Wars: Republic Heroes. However, I’m having trouble with finding the sound files and converting them into something useful. Here are the files I extracted: [http://www.mediafire.com/file/vxh3t6f3n ... s.zip/file](http://www.mediafire.com/file/vxh3t6f3neqd65j/Star_Wars_The_Clone_Wars_-_Republic_Heroes_-_All_Sound_Effects.zip/file), but I’m not sure how else I can better explain the situation. Any help would be appreciated.

Any plans of submitting them onto the Sounds Resource?

I do plan to submit them to Sounds Resource. Unfortunately, I don’t know how to decode them. I’m looking to find somebody who can help translate the sounds into .wavs and then submit them.

Just as I thought.
