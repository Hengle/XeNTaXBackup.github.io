- Post Title: NFL 2K4/2K5 music request

This is a big favor, but one hopefully someone would consider doing. I am a big fan of the old school ESPN NFL Primetime music you heard Sunday Nights in the 90s and early 00s. I found that some of them are actually included in the games NFL 2K4 and 2K5 for Playstation 2/XBox.

I'm wondering if someone would be kind enough to rip them for me? If needed I could track down iso's of the games.
