- Post Title: .PTX file format

This is texture file from game: The cursed crusade.
I know C/C++, but I don't have experience with researching file formats with unknown structure.
To research it I used Hex Editor Neo. I think it is similar to DDS file format, but with some changes.
For example dds file sizes are 43kb,171kb,342kb,683kb,1366 etc.
.ptx file sizes are almost the same, but for example
.dds file size 683kb(699 192 bytes)
.ptx file size 683kb(699 380 bytes)
As I said, I don't have experience with researching file formats.
Here is some .ptx files as an example.
