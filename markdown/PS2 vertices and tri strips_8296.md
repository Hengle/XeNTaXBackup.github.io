- Post Title: PS2 vertices and tri strips

I'm browsing through ps23d wiki and it looks like a lot of PS2 formats use the same vertex/face storage where you just string a bunch of vertices together and those are the faces.

So for example, if I have a sequence of vertices

[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, ...]

Are the faces just

0 1 2
1 2 3
2 3 4
...
