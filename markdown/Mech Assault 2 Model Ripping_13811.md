- Post Title: Mech Assault 2 Model Ripping?

Me and a friend are trying to make a Gmod addon for the Mech Assault 2 Mechs. tanks, enemey AI, etc. We saw this forum post and read through it all:  It hasnt seemed to help though, we are trying to rip them, and we use the QuickBMS Script but the MGF file is very mysterious, and odd. Any help?
