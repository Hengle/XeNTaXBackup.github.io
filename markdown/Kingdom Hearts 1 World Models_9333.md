- Post Title: Kingdom Hearts 1 World Models?

Good day to all.


I'm doing a project actually, and I need to extract the 3D models from Traverse Town from Kingdom Hearts 1 (PS2 Game)


I allready did a lot of research around this community. I allready being able to rip the game data from the DVD using KH1 Dumper, and using Noesis tool to being able to export the *.mdls character models.


But what I need is to import the world models. Like traverse town that I need so badly... I'm willing to even pay a remuneration to whoever can help me with this.

In my searches yesterday, I found that someone replied by being asked about world models from KH1, he said this:

But I dont know for which dumper from "Falo" he is refering. But the important fact is that he says that he uploaded a sample map.


So I guess it is possible? Anyone has any tips for this? thanks a lot for your time.

I'm pretty sure this one is Falo's dumper tool:

I can't help you with the map models or the maps itself though. From my memory they either weren't extracted or couldn't be openend with the normal model viewers around (like the KHI keyblades for example).
