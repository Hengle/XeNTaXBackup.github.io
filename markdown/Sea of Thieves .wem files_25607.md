- Post Title: Sea of Thieves .wem files

Hey all, so I've been trying to extract the audio from Sea of Thieves. I first tried using umodel and was able to get the sounds as uassets, however wasn't succesful in opening these archives. Then tried using fmodel and succeeded in getting the audio as .wem files, and then tried to use ww2ogg in combination with revorb to convert them into playable sounds. 

However, when running the batch it gives me a "no RIFF" error, so I looked at the files using HxD and spotted that there are no wave related headers.

Does anyone know of any more ways to convert the files, or otherwise another method of pulling them?
