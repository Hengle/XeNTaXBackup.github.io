- Post Title: Warhammer mark of chaos/battle march models/anims

Does anyone know how to rip the models/anims off this game? It has a kinda difficult format, one I have never seen (.ork). then again, it's a namco/bandai game.. like Dark Souls Prepare to die... difficult ones. maybe a quickbms script?

Use the two tools mentioned here to extract the ORK files from Mark of Chaos:

Then to import the models, simply use a directX .X mesh importer such as the one that comes with the free program Blender by default.
