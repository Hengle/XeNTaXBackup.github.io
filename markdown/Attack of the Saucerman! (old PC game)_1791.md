- Post Title: Attack of the Saucerman! (old PC game)

I couldn't find a demo for this game, and as I don't have a clue what function the respected data files have, I uploaded a sample from the full game: [http://rapidshare.de/files/15820657/Sau ... e.rar.html](http://rapidshare.de/files/15820657/SaucerMan__Sample.rar.html) (15MB).

Here's what I do know:Attack of the Saucerman! uses sprites and sounds, I'm guessing there are pcx/gif/jpg-like files in there, as well as WAV files.Using "FMV-Extractor", I was able to find WAV files in the LEVELS\*.wad files. Quite possibly, this is also where the other formats are located.All game content seems to be in a file called 'Saucerdata.pak', which basically is a big zip file. I made a report of the file using WinRAR, it's added in the sample archive too.
I would like to be able to extract the resources, mainly any graphics/sprites as present in the game. Since I found that the PCX\ folder still contains reference to the game's beta stage (file also included in the sample archive), I wonder what else there can be found. 

Thanks a lot in advance!
