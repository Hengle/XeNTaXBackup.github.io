Apparently someone on deviantART found some tools for the model extraction, and showed off some stuff. Does anyone here know of tools that can convert the model format?

Sorry, no model extractor exists for this game as far as I know. I was able to hardcode several models out of the game (which is why you only see cheria and sophie), but had trouble with other models. I no longer have the tool or the code.
