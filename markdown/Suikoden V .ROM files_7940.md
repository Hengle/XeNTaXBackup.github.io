- Post Title: Suikoden V .ROM files

So I'm trying to look into a simple way of ripping the models out of Suikoden V for the PS2.
The game had a CVS style archive on the disk in .PAK, and there's tonnes of these .rom files in various folders.

These examples come from the /BATLE/ folder. (Great spelling, Konami)
I've checked them out in a hex editor, and it starts with ".mor" - I assume the format that it actually is?

If anyone could help me out, that'd be great, and I'm sure that tonnes of fans would be very grateful! 

Examples:

[http://spriters-resource.com/dazz/BTL_PC004.ROM](http://spriters-resource.com/dazz/BTL_PC004.ROM)
[http://spriters-resource.com/dazz/BTL_PC006.ROM](http://spriters-resource.com/dazz/BTL_PC006.ROM)

I see a "LZS" in the header.
Does that mean it's using LZS compression?

I would presume so - I hadn't spotted that, to be quite honest (Total noob)
I'm a bit out of my depth with 3D models - I'm very much new to it all. I'm more of a sprites guy.
