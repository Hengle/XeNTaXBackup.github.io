- Post Title: Pokemon Battle Revolution fsys file compression Lzss

It is Lzss compressed and I am looking to extract a model and texture file from it.
It is in either one of these two files [http://www.mediafire.com/?zmdvmdozdnt](http://www.mediafire.com/?zmdvmdozdnt) [http://www.mediafire.com/?wdtmdmtmtrg](http://www.mediafire.com/?wdtmdmtmtrg)
I have looked for many solutions to this decompression, but no luck.

There is a program called gbalzss that unpacks the sounds from them but nothing else.
I really need help with this.

Thanks for reading.
