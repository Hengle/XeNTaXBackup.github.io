- Post Title: Genji: Days of the Blade (PS3)

Just for reference-- made by the same people that did Folklore and Knight's Contract.

Here's a screenshot of the game's content...

DT64 seems to have files for the sounds and cutscenes and the models seem to be located on the .data file.

Also tried looking at the game's DLC costumes in hopes of being to able to extract like the Folklore DLC but the models seem to be inside an encrypted .bin (?) file.
Is there a way to open the .data file and extract the models?
