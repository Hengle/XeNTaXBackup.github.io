- Post Title: Spellbreak?

I'm really loving this game and allot of people in the community would love to get their hands on the models for conversion to make 3d printed/cnc generated items or other community content. All the assets are in a .pak file but I haven't been able to get into it with conventional methods. If anyone is interested in helping me out I'd really appreciate it. The game is in Closed Alpha but there is NO NDA , so I could provide the .pak file for someone if needed.
