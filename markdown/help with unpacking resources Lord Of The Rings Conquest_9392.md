- Post Title: help with unpacking resources Lord Of The Rings: Conquest

sorry for my bad english    , so i tried to unpack the resources of this game (I am talking about .PAK and .BIN), but none of the game extractors could handle with them, then I found interesting program -QuickBMS, but alas-there is no script for the game, i cannot write script by myself either (i have no idea how to do that). Can anyone help me with this? Or maybe somebody has already unpacked game resources with some other program? Sorry if similar topic already exists-i did not find it, thank you for any sort of help.
