- Post Title: GTA V .awc audio add your own songs

I was looking to add my own songs into the radio stations to gta v 

I have looked for an app to accomplish this and came up with openIV, however its not for gtav and is only for the pc version of older gta games.

Any ideas?
Is there anyway to convert MP3 or WAV to AWC then import it to the .RPF.
Please help.

OpenIV with GTA V support will be released to the public after the game is released on PC.
