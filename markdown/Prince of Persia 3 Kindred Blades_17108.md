- Post Title: Prince of Persia 3: Kindred Blades

Hello, Xentax community. most of you may not know about the unreleased sequel to warrior within known as kindred blades, there are videos on youtube you could check there. I have managed to re-create the prince's cape from scratch, you can say that i reversed engineered it in a very strange way, but i made it to look just like the E3 demo of POP3. You can see a screenshot of my model with cape down below, ok so i wanted to ask for volunteers, i need help to add the cape into the game, and also i need a 3d modeller animator to make animations for the cape, and a person with experience that could replace 3d models inside games, i need people with whom i can work and find a solution. The reason why i am creating this modification is because, many people were dissapointed of Ubisoft not releasing the game that was ment to be relesead back in 2005, instead we got the two thrones thanks to the sot fanboys crying out. But atleast with good modders in this forum, i think we can ressurect the original game how it was supposed to be. If anyone wants to help me feel free to reply back and send me contact info on prv8 msg. Thanks
