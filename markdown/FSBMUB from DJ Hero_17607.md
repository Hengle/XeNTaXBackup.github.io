- Post Title: FSBMUB from DJ Hero

I'm trying to extract MIDI data from the game DJ Hero. Ten of the songs on there feature a "Guitar Mode" in which someone with a guitar from one of the Guitar Hero games can play along. My goal is to convert those songs over to be playable in the game Phase Shift.

According to [this old thread](http://www.scorehero.com/forum/viewtopic.php?p=1827193#1827193), the chart data is contained in FSBMUB files. I've attached the FSBMUBs associated with one song (which an XML file in the game tells me is 120 BPM) as a sample.

I'm not entirely sure what I'm looking at with these files. Anyone have a clue?
