- Post Title: TEX-files from assets-files (Unity 3D Engine)

Someone analyzed the format of the tex-files Unity 3D engine?
They are DDS-files without header.
But has its own 56-byte header.
First 8 bytes - width and height of the image.
And that means the other bytes?
Example-files: [http://rghost.ru/43228633](http://rghost.ru/43228633)
I have to manually convert the file (add header)

P.S. [Script for unpack tex-files from assets-files](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=13&t=4450&p=77959#p77959)

Riveal 10.5.2 can extract the textures and many of the other assets from Unity games.

I know this topic is very old, but does anyone know about tex file's header? I'm trying to interconvert between tex and dds.
