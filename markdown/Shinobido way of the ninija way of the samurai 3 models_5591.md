The requests of 3d models are not accepted in this forum. Anyway you can post some sample files extracted from the game disk and ask if somebody can help you to find a way to convert them in a 3d application format as 3ds max , blender...and so on. this is reverese engineering and this is what we try do in this forum.
Remember that before your request you should try  extract and convert it by yourself ora study on it.
PS: I think that the Pixellegolas's negative answer means what I just said...bye
