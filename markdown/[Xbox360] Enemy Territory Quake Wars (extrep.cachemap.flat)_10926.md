- Post Title: [Xbox360] Enemy Territory Quake Wars (ext/rep.cachemap.flat)

Hi to all, i'm trying to extract/repack the ".cachemap" files from the game to add some custom cvars and i can open the files with 7zip and Winrar and there is another file inside "source.flat", i can also open this file with 7zip and winrar but if i extract and repack it again the new file have a different compression. If someone know or can help here is two ".cachemap" files
