- Post Title: Weird .SKI file

Hi,

I've found a challenging .SKI file today that I can't seem to find a way to import to either 3Dsmax or Blender (or any other program).

I know you guys are the best with challenges like this, so here we go:

- Tried Zaramot's importer, but got "-- unable to convert: undefined to type: Integer" (link toZaramot's [viewtopic.php?f=16&t=11539](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=11539))
- Tried some importing scripts for blender, but failed as well

Thanks for you time guys! 

Cheers!!

I'm nowhere near the best, but I was able to whip this up.

Killercracker don't be so humble (let the humbleness to me   ), you are better than 99% of world population on scripts. 

AceWell and killercracker, thank you a lot for your help guys.

Cheers
