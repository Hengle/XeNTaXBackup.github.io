I don't know much about textures, but it looks like the format is ETC2_RGB
0x25 - image size
0x29 offset

i made a plugin for Noesis
which converts .vap to .ktx2 (ETC2_RGB, changes the header in the file, taking into account its resolution)
tool>bbr2 to tkx2 and paste path folder with textures(scans subdirectories too) or only paste full path one texrure
open .ktx2 in PVRTexTool

works great but some textures are a colored mess, doesn't work for other vector unit games aside from island adventure, and opening ktx2 in island adventure causes color mess
