Hey guys
when i try to open CE map files with the tools available (sounds.map for example) it says cannot open file. What's the problem? how can i extract this archive?

and what about .map files in 3, odst, reach and CE A games? can we open and repack them?

I'm bumping this topic. I tried this QuickBMS script and it failed. Are there programs that can unpack data from all Halo games?
