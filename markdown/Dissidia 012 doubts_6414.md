- Post Title: Dissidia 012 doubts

I have a few questions about the modeling of 012:

I see that many models have several clones with different animations. which ones can I recognize as being the best ones? -do DLC chars have this distinction as well?

how big are the Dissidia textures supposed to be? I know that being a psp game they can't be 2024*2024, but still isn't 256 a bit small? and how should I export them from noesis for the best quality?

I am also a bit curious: once I export the model with Noesis as .obj and load it in blender, is it normal that I have to actually manually set the texture for each material? or they should load automatically? 

thanks!
I'd love to post some files, but I'm not sure which ones would help understanding.
