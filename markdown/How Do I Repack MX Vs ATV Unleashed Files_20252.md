- Post Title: How Do I Repack MX Vs ATV Unleashed Files?

I'm trying to get the game to run on integrated intel graphics and so far I've unpacked the track data and fixed it, but can't seem to figure out how to repack them using Multiex. When I try to create a new archive the "Create Wizard" button does nothing and I don't know how to use Multiex editor.
