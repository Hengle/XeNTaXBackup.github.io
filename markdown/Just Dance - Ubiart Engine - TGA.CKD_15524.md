- Post Title: Just Dance - Ubiart Engine - TGA.CKD

Hey, I needed a little help.
I wanted to open TGA.CKD files from Wii U - Just Dance 2014/5/6/7 engine, but for some reason, I can't.
The only things i had to convert, failed (QuickBMS Ubi Art games) or even Noesis scripts, but those were for XBOX 360 (Which is old gen, and miss all the features from the new gen game)
All the JD14/5/6/7 engine/file structure/coding is the same, so a NOESIS script would be good for CKD Wii U.
Thanks for the help.
If needed more examples, tell me
