There are more than one EA BIG file formats to deal with (see xentax wiki for reference).
Which of them are you referring to? And what is the name of the game your files come from?

And by "10fb" I think you mean refpack compression. There are tools to deal with that, you just need to google "refpack decompressor" or something similar.


Also, please tell us which script are you using and upload a sample to analyze.
