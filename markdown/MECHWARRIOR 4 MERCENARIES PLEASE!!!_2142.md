MECHWARRIOR 4 MERCENARIES PLEASE!!!  And also regular MECHWARRIOR 4.  I've been looking for a program to extract ALL that game's audio files for 2-3 years now.  Game Audio Player [ [http://wiki.xentax.com/index.php/Extraction_tools](http://wiki.xentax.com/index.php/Extraction_tools) ] extract SOME of the audio, but not all since some of the sounds are still missing.   Is MultiEx Commander getting any closer to supporting MECHWARRIOR 4 MERCENARIES?  I can provide you files from the game to test if necessary.  Thanks.

lol.
Thinking about it wouldnt it have been easier if one of us had explained the file cutter tool to him?
As I like SO MANY PEOPLE dont fancy spending HOURS downloading a 500 meg file.

he fiel cutter tool is here on this forum, with it you cna take a 1 meg segment of your selected file and its then small enough to zip up and attach to you post in the forum.

lol no there is really no need for such LARGE files.

Simply use the tool i have added in my Post.

Its NOT MINE, its from the forum, i believe it to be mr mouses actually.

So yes use this tool on the file and itl split up the FRONT and BACK of the file, it normally gives us ENOUGH information to code a tool of a script for Multi Ex or even an EXERNAL tool, IE solidus, Jeader ect..

Simply post the cut piece as part of your post, As its a lot of time to download 100 + meg files when we may find out "OH NO its encrypeted and we cant crack it now", in which case we would have wasted much HD space lol

oh by the way.
Dont talk about torrents and Warez in this forum.
I once accidently got warned about it, so im just mentioning it before someone else does lol.
In case you dont know what waraz is il explain (as i never knew)/

Warez is the illegal software itself,  ie: a game such as yours, a program or anysort or anything like that

Thats pretty much how i got it explained to me in a seperate forum.

We don't want all the data.  We want a bit from the front and back as that usually says a lot about the rest of the file.  It's like going in for a blood test - they don't take all your blood, a little bit is enough to tell 'em about the rest.

no we dont need ALL the data, we can figure out whats INDIDE the file because the information containing the files contents is  inside the FRONT and BACK 90% of the time.

So just use the file cutter I attached in my post, and then attact the file it exports to one of your posts.
thne we will Examine it for you and see what we can find/learn from it.

> It's like going in for a blood test - they don't take all your blood, a little bit is enough to tell 'em about the rest.Thats a damn good example my friend lol.



> whats the front and back?
THing of your file in terms of a good book.
You have the FONT the MIDDLE and the BACK.
Files are similer to this, they have 3 parts, so using the file cutter it will make a copy of the front and BACK data of the file you want it to.
Does that all make sense or do you want a more detailed Explenation(not sure how much more detailed i can make it though

A file is a very long string of bytes. 

For instance, a file could look like this, each letter represents one byte. 

```
SDFHFNGNBCVCXZXCVVNM12837485E
```


The first byte, S, is at position 1 (or 0 for geeks). 

So:

```
123456789....and so on.....
FRONT.......MIDDLE.......BACK
```


The second byte is D, see?

So the FRONT of the file starts at the S byte. 
The end of the file starts at byte E (the last byte in the string). 

If we say we need the front and the back of a file we need a number of bytes from the start (FRONT) of the file (in example say "SDFHFN"), na from the end (BACK) of the file (in example say "37485E"). 

The file cutter tool can cut of pieces from the start and from the end, it will zip it and you can upload that zip file. 

Why can we use only that and not the whole file? Because important information about the contents of archives is usually saved at the front (start) or at the back (end) of the archive.

one or 2 of the mw4 files is better.
As you can OPEN the CAB, so the CAB file doesnt need ANALYSING, only the files you DONT UNDERSTAND need analysing.
btw Mr. Mouse How many posts does it take to become another level or a VIP member?

actually pretty much all the audio are stored in those 2 files.  this is verified using the game audio player to extract them [some were not extracted since game audio player didn't detect them].

btw: i'm not after the music.  i'm actually after the voice / speech, and other sounds.

Any chance oyu can link me to or possibly UPLOAD game audio player.
As i found 2 files of audio in ADX format but thats it,
i scanned with both Jeader and with Multi Ex and NEITHER can find any known formats in there.
I KNOW there are .TGA files in Props, and Textures seems to contain SOEMTHING else maybe Models but I cant seem to find any audio files in either of them, Are you sure that there isnt a VOX or BGM file anywhere?

VOx would have all the ingame speach deffinatly but it doesnt seem like these files do at all.
Il still look at this audio player and see WHAT it finds in THESE uploaded files.

I have tried MultiEx Commander on your MW4 files and they open! What reason did you have to believe these MW4 files were any different as those already supported by MultiEx Commander?

See also [http://wiki.xentax.com/index.php/Mech_W ... ercinaries](http://wiki.xentax.com/index.php/Mech_Warrior_4_-_Mercinaries)

I was waiting for some examples, to see if these files were any different. But no, it seems they open with Multiex Commander no problemo. So go do it!

I haven't tried.  I just checked the "MultiEx Commander Supported Games List"...

Mechwarrior 4 Merc MW4 No

So if it's supported, is it complete in revealing all the audio and other files?  Can the audio be extracted into a standard readable format?

Well,it seems to be able to extract all files. The WAV files all have two parts in the archive a {handle} part and a data part. Please extract some of those and zip them. Perhaps we can glue those two parts together.

Also, the NO referred to editing of those MW4 files, extraction IS supported. All files listed there are supported for extraction. And a large part of those can also be edited. If so, there will be a YES there.

With edit I mean replace resources in the MW4 archives, not just extracting them. 

THe other thing, if you open the props.mw4 file with MexCom you will notice there are WAV files somewhere near the middle. You will also notice they come in pairs, with one of them also having the term {handle} in its name. I assume this will provide info on the actual WAV file, perhaps even a header (info needed to play the file). I don't have the whole props file, so I can't check. If you can extract some of those pairs and sent them that'll be swell.
