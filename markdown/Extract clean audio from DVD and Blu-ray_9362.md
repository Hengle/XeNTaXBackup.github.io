- Post Title: Extract clean audio from DVD and Blu-ray

I want some good quality audio from my Buffy DVDs, audio which has not been released on cd and that the author has taken down from his website (and it was a mp3 file anyway so not good). do you have any suggestions on how I could do it?

EDIT: I found something called "extra boy pro" but I have no idea how to use it.

[VGMToolbox](http://sourceforge.net/projects/vgmtoolbox/) can extract the raw audio from the VOB files found on DVDs.

Just got to Misc. Tools > Stream Tools > Video Demultiplexer, and select "DVD Video (VOB)" from the drop down.  Then drag and drop your VOBs onto the tool.

Depending on the output (AC3, DTS, etc...), you'll need to find the appropriate plugins for converting to WAV (if you need to).
