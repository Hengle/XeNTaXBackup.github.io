- Post Title: Rad tools 2018 has viruses?

So I recently deleted RADTools (A tool that a lot of you modders must know because it's brought up in so many games) by accident and didn't mean to, So i went onto their website and downloaded it again BEFORE that though, every download i do on the internet i scan it and... HOLY LORD 22 VIRUS FILES! I thought to myself "No, this couldn't happen! They've been supporting us for a long time!" So i clicked the file and.. I'm greeted with my antivirus blocking it completely. Can someone please go on a VIRTUAL BOX and try it? DO NOT do it on your normal computer - do it on a virtual box. Then tell me the result Here's the scan i did
RadTools (Recent version): [https://www.virustotal.com/#/file/dee11 ... /detection](https://www.virustotal.com/#/file/dee11c5e5c326a32680d299d419a9affa40a503fd432c6390550a6d3bd22e344/detection)
RadTools (Version before the recent): [https://www.virustotal.com/#/file/3cb1f ... /detection](https://www.virustotal.com/#/file/3cb1f66815157209afee876f6e659c40b523d73a41089e959bf773af600693be/detection)
I really need the answer of the result to know
AND REMEMBER TO DO IT ON VIRTUAL BOX.
