The big question here is, WHY would you create another thread for such a question when one was already posted, you could have used that.

And to answer your question its not possible due to game being released for latest firmware, games can only be dumped up to firmware 5.05.
And damn, seriously, no one knows how to do research anymore? Let me guess, they made no app for that yet, oh man, the horror, just saying.
