- Post Title: the evil within 2 ptr and pkr hex structure help

hello, i think we all have the script bms of alugi to extract tew2 ptr and pkr file but we know that we cant repack it because alugi use a temp variable to extract the file in his script (MEMORY_FILE). im not good at bms but better in autoit, so i want to ask if somebody here knows/understands the structure of these two files (in hex), if there is, would you please explain me so that i can make a autoit script. thanks
