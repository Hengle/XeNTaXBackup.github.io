- Post Title: Remove or disable KOF 2002 soundtrack?

How do I remove/disable KOF 2002 background music on the Playstation 2 version with some modification? Could someone modify the PS2 rom for me and disable the audio? Or do something in there that could remove or disable that background music audio.

Do I want to leave only the voices and sound effects in the PS2 version? Since by normal means, through the menu and others, it is not possible to do this, since the game itself does not allow it, but I would like to know other methods. Could someone make some changes to the PS2 KOF 2002 rom or do something to disable the background music?

I tried in 2019, I even asked someone for help, that someone tried to help me, I passed the rom and it was broken, he warned me, I found a certain one on the internet and that someone never saw the message, I just don't know if it was here or on Zenhax, but that's it and I hope you have a good day.
