Hey there,

 i have been battling to find extractors/editors/rippers with support for the above games. Their archives are in .ork, obviously proprietary format. I thought i would get mp3s from Mark of Chaos, since the Miles Sound System kind of gave it wawy, but no extractions were possible.

Any luck on your side? Maybe a Mexcom plugin?

I have created an extractor, the only problem is that the files are encrypted with their names (which are not included in the ORK archives) so without knowing them you cannot extract them:

Looked over here?

Jeremy Soule has the MOC soundtrack on his digital downloads, think you have to pay for it through.

If you chose to do it that way
