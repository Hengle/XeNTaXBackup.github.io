- Post Title: Harveys neue augen - need help with data.vis

Hello, game is the same as A new beginning, but unpakke has problem with it.

when i unpack and pack again file data.vis, without any changes, then filesizes are not the same and in game are not texts. I think, it uses some different method. Here is both files (original data.vis and unpacked/packed dataa.vis) Please help me with this.

Thank you

Filip

Use Unpakke for unpack and repack files.

Hello Veteran,

but unpakke has problem with it.

i tried Unpakke, but there is bescribed problem. Try yourself. Link to files above. Try unpack and then pack again - filesize will be bad

when i use newest version of unpakke, then Unknown Type: 74071000 appears and all files are 0bytes
