I cannot write a code nor script yet. 
I cannot present anything excluding respect to you.

So..I want some 3d model from more consumer games.
But I not think i should be able to post consecutive like spammer.
I want to get everybody to feel comfortable.
Frankly,If I post some samples in quick succession, what do you feel on my posts?

Also, I want to make <KaWaii> girl 3d modeling.
But outcome is just like ...ah.. SCARY MONSTER?
Therefore, I want to capture a lot of consumergames models, and to refer.  

Thanks.

Should be fine, I've been posting game after game and no one really said anything bad.

Thank you so much, finale00.
Hereafter, I will some posts.
If they can be solved, I am glad.
