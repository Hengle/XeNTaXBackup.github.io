I ran it through DragonUnpacker, and it's got a load of .png .bmp, .wav and .avi files in it (and maybe more), which you can extract with that.

There must be a table elsewhere in another file that references all of these, but I couldn't see one.

I was thinking more of one that extracts the file with proper names.
