- Post Title: SDD header (Just Dance 2015-2019 Wii)

I'm trying to create my own textures for JD2019, but when I open the .tga.ckd files in HxD, the header instead of saying DDS says SDD, and when I open it in Photoshop or Paint.net it opens with error.

someone has a solution?


This is what the header looks like:

1)  Here is an example of the textures of Havana:

2) I opened the textures with your JD2018 script for Noesis, and when I combine them by hand or modify these textures, and open them in Noesis or Dolphin, they come out corrupt and duplicated:

I need to know how to correct this error  


PD: I'm making a VIPMADE mod, that's why I'm modifying the textures.

modding is not my area so i can't help you with putting the modified texture back into the game,   
but exporting the ckd textures from Noesis as dds and combining the alpha layer with the color layers is easy
in Photoshop, just open the color image dds and alpha image dds and add alpha channel to color image 
(if it doesn't already have one) then select all of alpha image and copy it to alpha channel in color image.
