- Post Title: Fairytale Fights background models

Hi, I'm looking for someone who knows how to extract the files from the game: Fairytale Fight.
A game created and edited by Playlogic International.
The game is only for Xbox360 and PS3.

I don't found any tools or something to extract the files from the iso of a 360 game :/
I'm a real noob and I try to understand how to do with your tutorials, but it's very complicated ^^""
