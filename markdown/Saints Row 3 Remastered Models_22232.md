- Post Title: Saints Row 3 Remastered Models

Hi, recently bought SR 3 remaster and noticed the models are much higher and better quality. I attempted to extract them using some old scripts for the vpp_pc and str2_pc files on this forum but it appears they don't work probably due to different file compression format and such.

I was wondering if someone might want to take a look at getting these models and textures out from the game. Attached below are the str2_pc and it's contents for Shaundi, it's 41mb so I've uploaded it to google drive because it won't let me attach here.

Ah, it looks like his tool is still a work in progress then. Well in that case I guess my request is answered hopefully
