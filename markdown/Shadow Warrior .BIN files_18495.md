- Post Title: Shadow Warrior .BIN files

From following the old post before, it seems that the password has either been changed or no longer works, as when I try and extract the files the .rar will display an error saying that a few of the specified files will not be extracted due to the password being incorrect, and I have used the password that supposedly unencrypts the files.

Can someone help me?
