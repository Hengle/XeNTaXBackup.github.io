- Post Title: The 3rd Birthday (Parasite Eve 3) t3bpack files

Hi all!

The [bulk of what I've found so far](https://www.reddit.com/r/ParasiteEve/comments/uucae4/3rd_birthday_music_swapping/) about this game is on this Reddit thread I made yesterday, but I am hoping that texture-replacement mods will be possible, since other PSP Square Enix games of the era seem able to do so, like Birth by Sleep or Dissidia 012.

The models/textures/SOME sounds for various characters are contained in .pack/.t3bpack files; the vast majority of the game's files are in the 3rd.pkg file of the game, which can be extracted easily with Noesis. The t3bpack files are in the "arcs" folder that Noesis creates, and the model, textures, and animations can also be previewed in Noesis. I've attached an example of the file below, of the playable character. It has one mesh and 3 texture sheets (alternate versions used when damaged a certain amount).

I'm putting this thread in "compressed files" because I honestly cannot make out anything when looking in a hex editor, and I am certain that the t3bpack files contain multiple things, like the mesh, skeleton, textures, sometimes sounds, and maybe AI behavior or stats. Thanks!
