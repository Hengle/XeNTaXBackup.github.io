Hello friends, I try to open SDU file, where I presume are sounds files, with MultiEx and try to search file for extension (ogg, wav, mp3, etc..) but It found nothing.. nothing 
What codec audio use this games?
Text file are in XDU pack, simple to create and repack, but SDU are more difficult, probably because I'don't know what codec audio it's using.
Thanks

Hi guys,

Sometimes we don't reply to a post if the user doesn't read the Game Request Rules (such as posting a sample archive) . I know I usually try to post a reply anyway, but both Mr Mouse and I just get sick of having to say "read the rules" all the time.

So... read the rules 

If someone can supply us with some files to look at, that'd be great.
