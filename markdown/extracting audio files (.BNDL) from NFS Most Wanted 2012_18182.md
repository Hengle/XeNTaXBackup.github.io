Hello, i need someone who help me to extract/unpack audio files (Cop Speech) from Need For Speed: Most Wanted 2012. Every files i want to convert are packed in a single giant file called: SPEECHEVENTSEQUENCES.SWC0 (sample of the file -> [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1X0jfHo ... sp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1X0jfHoU29j9HhGrzkaXzXOhz93FEJq0K/view?usp=sharing) )
Among game files, there's also another file that could be related to the voicelines -> [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XS940m ... sp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XS940mvo9eKOMbWHgaL-YAGNdqI5_0nk/view?usp=sharing)
It likely contain information on where and when the actual voicelines are being used while gaming...
Could someone please help me to unpack those files and convert them into a common audio files format such as .mp3 / .wav ???
Thanks.
