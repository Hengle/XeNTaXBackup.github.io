.BIG/.STB/.LEV file spec can be found here.

[http://fabletlcmod.com/forum/index.php? ... 50&start=0](http://fabletlcmod.com/forum/index.php?t=msg&th=50&start=0)&

.WAD C++classes

[http://fabletlcmod.com/forum/index.php? ... =3&start=0](http://fabletlcmod.com/forum/index.php?t=msg&th=3&start=0)&

All the formats are the same as the xbox version. Most of the assets are internally lzo1x compressed but we don't know how to uncompress them.

.LUG should be wave files, filenames and offsets possibly listed in the corresponding .MET. And actual audio should correspond to the text listed in the dialogscript.big.



could really use some help with the lzo compression. I've tried all the obvious stuff. [http://www.lzop.com](http://www.lzop.com) and such.

Its prolly not a good idea to post about illegal software.  Esp when this game isn't even scheduled for release until sept 30th, and there is no demo.

As you can see, it has been brought to my attention that this game is not even released yet. 

That means were are dealing with leaked (illegal) versions of the game. 

We will not get involved in this, our mission is to support legal mod activity only. Topic closed.
