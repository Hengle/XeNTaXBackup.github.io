- Post Title: [REQUEST]Shaiya (MMORPG) file import/conversion

I need to be able to edit these .3dc wire frames within the server files and be able to save them  . At this moment , all I can find is a viewer ( 3d object converter) . Also , I would like to have the ability to convert wire frames from Aion to Shaiya. Im looking to import weapons . If I I can obtain a proven method to do one or both , I will even pay.

If you need an example of these files , I can send you whatever samples you need. I'm developing a server and would appreciate some of your 3d expertise

I don't remember seeing any 3ds files in shaiya.
Is that the format you have exported the models to?

I can import any compatible file . Problem is , finding a conversion process that allows me to mod , then save in existing format.

I could write a shaiya exporter for the 3DO and SMOD formats in noesis, but for 3DC there is some weird stuff in the vertex.

Well, maybe the answer lies in 3d object converter . Because I can load the files and view them in that program. I just cannt save them in an editable format , and save for importation.

First of all, are you able to put any 3d object (3dc,3do, smod etc) back into the archive/game!?
I'd been paid for donig a full maxscript importer(3d objects, animation) for Shaiya long time ago!

Try this 3do file I exported from 3dsmax! If you can put it back to the game, you can contact me for the exporter!

*by the way, weapons in Shaiya are in 3do format!

I exported some C9 swords to Shaiya .3do format with the latest (unpublished yet) v4.801 3D Object Converter.

Ok, I was able to import an Aion mesh. But 2 problems : 1 the item shows up in game as huge . How can I scale it down? Also , and way to make the texture that goes with the mesh work correctly?

Btw, you guys have been great . I have gotten more accomplished in 2 days with this post than I have in the last 2 years anywhere else.

You can open the model in any 3D editor, scale it down manually, and then export it to the shaiya format.

- Open your file with 3D O. C.
- Use the Tools/Geometry Transformation function
     - Scale factor (about)= 0.01  0.01  0.01
- Export the .3do file

I rewrote the 3D Object Converter's (unpublished) .3dc export module based on the new idea I used firstly in the Rysk Your Life 2 .z3m save module.

(A nice user from Brazil tested it in the Shaiya Online already.)


I uploaded the latest version to my web page:
[http://www.i3dconverter.com/3doc/downlo ... rtable.zip](http://www.i3dconverter.com/3doc/downloads/3doc_v5.334_portable.zip)


How to edit the original .3dc file:

- Open the original .3dc file with 3D O. C.

- Export it to 3D Studio .3ds format
(If you export it to .obj format the 3D Studio MAX maybe optimize the loaded model, in this case it is bad.)

- Import the .3ds to 3D Studio Max
- turn on the Completely replace current scene
- turn off the convert units
(if you will not turn it off the 3DS Max scale down the models 40-fold!)

- Modify the 3d geometry (you can move the 3d points, but don't delete 3d points)

- Export it to .3ds format

- Import the .3ds to 3D O. C.

- Export it to .3dc file (with selecting the original .3dc file).

- The exported .3dc file will contain the original bone related datas with the new 3d geometry.

Excellent. Only one problem Mr Karpati. I have the Windows (registered) version. I do not have a Mac. Any suggestions?
Edit : Ignore that
