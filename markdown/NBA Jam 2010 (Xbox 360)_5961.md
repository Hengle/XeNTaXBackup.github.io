I wish to extract the music from these files if possible. I have no idea what type of archives these are. They're just labelled: 0A 0B 0C 0D

Each one is 1.66GB and I believe the codec for the audio is XMA.

I was extracting it flag by flag, but after a certain instance, it just didn't convert properly.

So I was wondering if anyone could write an unpacker for these files or find a way to identify the music within these files.

Here's the first 10MB from the 1.66GB files, the 50MB Default.xex file and the small "su20076000_00000000" file just in case.
