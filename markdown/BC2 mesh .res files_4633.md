- Post Title: BC2 mesh .res files

Has anyone had a look at the mesh .res files in Battlefield Bad Company 2 ?
I got programs to convert the dbx to text, and texture .res files to .dds

I have extracted the AmmoCrate model (with converted texture and dbx files) and uploaded it [HERE](http://filebeam.com/fa42ebeb7ab5bca3848e8b23248a9f1d) for anyone interested in taking a look.

Some dude created a 3dsmax 8 importer of the BF2 meshes, I don't know if they have anything in common, but I'm uploading the importer [HERE](http://filebeam.com/c445375f8f6de8c215dd492b61945667)
