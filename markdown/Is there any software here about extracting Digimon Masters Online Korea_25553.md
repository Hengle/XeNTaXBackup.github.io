Apparently they're one tool that extract the pack01.pf but it hasn't being updated in almost 10 years and what is even worst is that someone in a private way they is a tool for fully unpack the data of the game, because someone has being updating the DMOWiki with actual renders taken from Noesis after loading a .nif file.

But it is more unlikely they will share the new version that decrypt the game package. And because it is a wiki page, one cannot contact the person that is uploading those images either way.

in theory the full data is not compressed or even encrypted, the TOC of what is where inside the full pack is encrypted, so in theory, having enough idea what to do to unpack the data will give access to raw files that could be turned into 3d files/textures, but only way to know which assets are which would be using the correct toc, im not sure if anyone has tried but probably that unpacked TOC will be found in RAM memory when the game is open, but given that it uses some anticheat system using some ram editor maybe would crash the game or get you banned XD

but again, its not as important having the names as long as you are willing to map all the files and just use some checksum or some method to compare file sizes and probably would be able to sustain said method in the future
