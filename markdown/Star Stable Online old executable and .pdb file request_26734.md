- Post Title: Star Stable Online old executable and .pdb file request

Hello,

I recently started looking into this game called "Star Stable Online". My friend told me that they used to send their players the .pdb file along with the game's executable. I'm looking for an older version of the game's executable with the corresponding debug database file.

Although I doubt anybody active here still has it, It would be extremely useful.

Thank you in advance

TYSM

I think they stopped shipping the .pdb file as they switched to x64
