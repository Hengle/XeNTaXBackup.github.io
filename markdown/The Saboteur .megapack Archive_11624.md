- Post Title: The Saboteur .megapack Archive

Hello everyone!

I have a data archive format from the game "The Saboteur." Pandemic's final game before closing.

There are 3 major data archives with an extention called a ".megapack" and they seem to be the archives that house the games data.
There are three main data formats I have seen, ".kilopacks", ".packs", and ".megapacks". There are a few ".bin" files, and lots of obscure formats.
It seems the ".megapack" files are the largest by a large margin and likely contain the major game data I'm looking for but haven't been able to get to.
Because I have no access to these files, I have no way of knowing for sure exactly what's inside, but it would most likely contain models, textures, sounds, and possibly external animations. 
I'm not sure on what format the textures are, but a lot of logos and in game symbols and signs are kept in .dds format. I don't know how exactly that would affect their choice of format for the textures.
I don't know about the animations if they're in there, but I found a file called "ComplexAnimations.cxa" in the Cinematics folder, there may be more of this format in the archive.
As for models, I honestly can't say for sure what format those are in, I couldn't find any example files loose in the directory to base upon.
I know for sure that the fonts are contained in a separate .megapack thanks to a thread listed below.

The three files I'm looking at are "mega0.megapack" which is 383,112 KB, "mega1.megapack" which is 2,001,364 KB, "mega2.megapack" which is 165,386 KB.
For anyone who has the game or has acquired the files, these three files can easily be found in the "France" folder which can be found in the main directory.
I wish I could include a sample, but of course due to forum rules I can not upload any samples of these files as they are copyrighted data for a commercial game.
It would seem, from my understanding of the rules, that data clippings from either Mouse's or Watto's Filecutters would also still be unacceptible to post publicly.
Due to this, it would seem that it would seem that anyone who is interested in assisting me with this archive would either need to own the game or find a way of acquiring it.

I would very much appreciate if people could take a whack at the format and see if they could get it unpacked. My end goal is to be able to unpack the files and be able to repack them to make working modifications of the game.
I do hope to be able to repack this format and still be able to get it to work with the game, but just the ability to unpack the content would be a very large help to me.
I realize that this archive may be of very large difficulty as you don't know with certainty what files are in here or their formats necessarily.
I don't know a lot about reverse engineering, but I can't imagine this is exactly an easy task, if you can get a certain type of format out as is, that would be a breakthrough for me.

This is a subject of large importance for me, I can only hope someone here can find time for me.
I would greatly appreciate any assistance on this!
Thank you so much for reading this!



And I did not come just with a request only, I wanted to come here and share some information, and a tool specific to The Saboteur, to help anyone else who might be looking into modding the Saboteur like I am.

= = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =

I originally was going to link them and share some general Saboteur modding info at the end of this thread, but it..ended up being over a thousand and a half words and I didn't find any spoiler tags.. 
So instead of spamming up this thread, I copied the same text over to a google docs file.
[https://docs.google.com/document/d/113g ... ZC0dbg/pub](https://docs.google.com/document/d/113g3WE5j6H15RXaDxwHUHN0PnmtjQBRjgss-UZC0dbg/pub)
I hope everyone who wants to look here can see it..I had expected to put it in this thread but it's way way too much text.

Anyhow, there's two tools in there, one original tool and a modification of that tool to expand it's use to extract and decompile the games Lua Scripts.

And a special thanks to Will Kirkby for creating the tool I have linked in the google docs page, I am very thankful for his assistance!
Thanks for reading this, sincerely.
