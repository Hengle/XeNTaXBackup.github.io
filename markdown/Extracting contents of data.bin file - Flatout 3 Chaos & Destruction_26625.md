Hello guys, I'm trying to access the content of the data.bin file for the game Flatout 3: Chaos & Destruction. I am looking for a solution that extracts and reimports the files inside the original to be able to perform a translation for the game. I will attatch the .bin file to be analyzed. I am grateful for any help you can offer me, thank you!

It's just a .zip archive

I compressed the .bin file into a .zip as the forum did not allow me to attach the original file :/

No, he meant that your BIN file is literally a ZIP archive.

Rename "Data.bin" to "Data.zip" and you'll be able to open it in Winrar.
Although it's password protected, so you need to guess the password before extracting.
