- Post Title: I want to extract the CVM file of PS2 VirtualOn: MARZ

I apologize first for using Google Translate for this sentence

I would like to extract "ROFSVO4.CVM" from "PS2 VirtualOn: MARZ".
I read past articles on this forum but I didn't understand so I decided to ask for help

I found that the CVM was encrypted
I found that I use "cvm_tool"
But I couldn't find the password

I don't know what I need so I'll list it below
URL of the eeMemory.bin file

The URL of the 15MB CVM file from the beginning of the file

Thanks for watching
