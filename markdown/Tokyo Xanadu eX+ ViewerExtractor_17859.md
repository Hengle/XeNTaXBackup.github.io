- Post Title: Tokyo Xanadu eX+ Viewer/Extractor

Hello,

here is a tool for viewing/extracting models and textures from the PC game Tokyo Xanadu eX+. It can only open "dds.phyre" and "dae.phyre" files. You will need to decompress the game archive first to get these files. Check out these tools for doing that : 
[BRA Decompress](https://heroesoflegend.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=356)
[PKG Decompress](https://github.com/weaknespase/toxana-tkit)

Program overview:


How to use
- File -> Open to load a single file. File -> Open Folder to load all the files inside a folder.
- Export -> Export All to export all loaded files (meshes as IQE(skinned)/Obj, textures as png).
- You can select the mesh/texture in the file list to see a preview. Don't close the mesh preview window, once you open it. Or you need to restart the app to open it again.
- You can export files one at a time by clicking "Save as Obj/Iqe/Png".

Note: You need to have .Net 4.6.2 installed.

I don't own the game yet, so I made the program based on some sample files I found online. They were all character models and they seemed to work fine. If you have problems loading a model, send me a pm with a sample file and I will try to fix it.

Amazing! You just made my day by providing the tools for this lovely game, thank you so much akderebur!

I'm currently testing how this tool works. I'll let you know if I find any bugs or whatever.

EDIT: I sent you a PM with some problems I faced.

Updated the tool, you can download the new version from the link in the first post.

What's new
- Lot more character/monster models can be loaded now. Almost all of them should work. Thanks to MVEGETA for testing.
- Added support for maps
- Fixed some problems with the IQE export

Map objects :


Note: Model preview doesn't work well with maps, it might be easier to directly export the models as obj and view them in a 3D software.

I was more than happy to be a part of this effort, even though all I did was some testing and providing you with files.

We now have a tool that can successfully extract almost everything from Tokyo Xanadu EX+ and it's all thanks to you! 
Given that, I don't think that a further update will be needed anytime soon.

I lost the file because I didn't call it. Does Monga have to plug it in separately? Or do I have to install something else?
