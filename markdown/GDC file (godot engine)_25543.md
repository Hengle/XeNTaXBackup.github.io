- Post Title: GDC file (godot engine)

Hi guys, I'm working on a translation project for a game made by Godot engine, and this file contains the last text we need to translate. Can someone make a bms script or have a tool, or how can I open this file in Godot? If someone knows, pls tell me, tks everybody!

GDC files are not archives, they are compiled script files (a.k.a. GDScript files).

You need to use compiler/decompiler to edit any GDC file. Here is one:
