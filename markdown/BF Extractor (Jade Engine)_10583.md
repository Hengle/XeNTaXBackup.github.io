- Post Title: BF Extractor (Jade Engine)

A simple tool that should (but doesn't have to) extract a content of the *.BF files from games on Jade engine like:
– Beyond Good & Evil
– Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time
– Prince of Persia: Warrior Within
– Prince of Persia: The Two Thrones
– Peter Jackson's King Kong: The Official Game of the Movie
– Rayman Raving Rabbids
– TMNT
– Rayman Raving Rabbids 2
– Naruto: Rise of a Ninja
– Naruto: The Broken Bond
– James Cameron's Avatar: The Game (Wii version) <not supported yet>
– Prince of Persia: The Forgotten Sands (Wii / PSP version) <not supported yet>

Edit: Due to a lot of PMs regarding this tool, I have to say - I am NOT the author of this tool. Thank you.

I suppose that WII games on Jade engine has a different structure of *.BF files and for now they can't be extracted. You should write a message to Rahly ([memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&u=321](http://forum.xentax.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&u=321)) and ask him for support of WII games

Hi,
I tried this program with the "Sally.bf" from the BGAE 360 version but the GUI says "Getting Listing" since 25 minutes but nothing happens, it didn't crash, uses 0% CPU and remains at 3.552K Ram usage.   

Edit:
Tried the .exe now after noticing I had to use it via CMD and looks like it works fine.

Sorry for having to bump this as well, but while trying to extract the files for the Knig Knog demo using this in the CMD, it says "bfextractor has stopped working". Anybody care to help me with this problem?

hello. is there a way to convert production bf bundles to alpha bundles? i'm trying to open just dance 1 bundles in the leaked jade engine but it's a production bundle from the game files and the jade engine can't open them so i need to find a way to convert it to alpha. you can tell if a bf is a production one if it has checksums at the end of the file.

Hi there, I am having the same problem with GUI! What command did you use with CMD to extract? I am doing sally.bf from Beyond Good & Evil.

Thanks!
