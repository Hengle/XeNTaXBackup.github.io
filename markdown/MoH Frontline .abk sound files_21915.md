- Post Title: MoH Frontline .abk sound files

Any kind soul who would like to help me extracting the sound files from this great game? I've tried for a long time but only managed to rip 
just a few files using PSound. I'm especially interested in voice and ambient sfx. 

Here are some sample files for anyone who would like to help me, it would be much apreciated!

Thanks!
