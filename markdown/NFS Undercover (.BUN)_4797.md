- Post Title: NFS Undercover (*.BUN)

Hi. I wonder can someone convert models from [*.bun file](http://www.sendspace.com/file/0mizeo) of NFS Undercover (and i think other nfs: shift, prostreet)

P.S.: Actually i'm interesting in characters. I can extract textures from those file but not models.

the old program total comander with the gaup (game archive unpacker) can open nfsu1 - undercover bun files

[http://www.totalcmd.net/plugring/gaup.html](http://www.totalcmd.net/plugring/gaup.html)

it will show you bin files inside the bun - xx.tpk.bin for texture packs - xx.geo.bin for geometry - xx.unk.bin for? position info, interface buttons and other things

some geo parts from underground 1 and 2 can be converted with bin2ase - but a lot is ****ed up 
one version of zmod2.0.7 i think can open mw geometrys - but also ****ed up

all the other games are not supported

O thanks man  Now i'm extracted those .BUN files and get exactly what you saying. I'm attached .GEO.BIN file with character model from unpacked attached in firs post Scene_PIPAngie_BundleB.bun.

Can anyone convert .GEO.BIN to something readable?

p.s.: Also i attached archive with unpacked [Angie character model](http://www.sendspace.com/file/axs0h0) from NFS Carbon.
