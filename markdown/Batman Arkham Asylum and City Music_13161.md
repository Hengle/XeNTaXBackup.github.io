Hi, I am trying to extract music files from Batman Arkham Asylum and Arkham City. However, I have no idea where the music files are, let alone how to extract them. Can someone help me please?

For Arkham Asylum, the music is scattered around in various Unreal package format files.

For example, some music can be found in the BmGame\CookedPC\Maps folders - for example "Admin.umap" contains a couple of music files, as does "Admin_B1.umap", and many others in these folders.  There's a lot of files in here to go through.

More music files can be found in the BmGame\CookedPC\Packages\SoundFMOD folders.

Also, BmGame\Movies contains music in some of the video sequences.

Any Unreal extractor should give you a good starting point.  It's a while since I looked at this game, so I can't remember how easy/difficult it was to get all of the music.
