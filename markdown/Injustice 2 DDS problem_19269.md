- Post Title: Injustice 2 DDS problem

Hey guys,



I'm currently trying to convert some models and textures.

The models themselves went alright but when it comes to the textures the DDS ones are messed up.



they all come out like this: 



This is the only thing that comes out with Photoshop, when I try to open it with Irfan, then it just tells me it's an incorrect DDS file.

I tried using the ue3_oodle_dds.bms file but to no luck.

Am I doing something wrong or am I just missing something?



I'm looking for the BM_DLCHB specificly, so if anyone can help me get these out in high res I'd be ever so thankfull
