- Post Title: Evolution Engine PNG (Star trek 2013)

So I've been trying to dig back into some old files, specifically evolution engine running star trek 2013. Right now all I'm trying to do is get the textures working. 

I know that the files are split somehow across the packages but haven't been able to get to grips exactly how yet.

Looking at the H file, I'm clearly seeing a header of sorts. 

```
MaxResolutionXbox360=MR_512
MaxResolutionPS3=MR_512
�–���	�������������������������������������€?��€?��€?��€?���������������€?��€?��€?��€?��€?V>€Ï=wú¶<��€?¬ñ8>qW�=ˆr£<������������������€?ÿÿ?~l>~l>��€?����
```


and if I dig into the files located in the F and B tocs I clearly get some visual data but can't get anything decent, even when combining the two binary files. 

As an example for F

and the same for B

My assumption here is that the files in B are merely a lower resolution version, but obviously don't know for certain. Has anyone gotten evolution engine textures to work previously?
