- Post Title: [PS3] Totori no Atelier, Meruru no Atelier

Instructions:
1.) Take all PSSG gz files and using WinRAR, extract each to a separate directory (otherwise, feel pain of thousands of files in one directory).
2.) Place totori.exe file in the root directory that contains all model folders (btlField, cg, chara, ..., worldmap).
3.) Run totori.exe.
4.) It will take 10 minutes to a half hour to process all model files and extract textures.
5.) LightWave export works good, OBJ works, but it generates lots of files. You have to figure out how to merge them in your choice of modeler.
6.) Textures have to be manually applied; program also exports morph maps and I can't tell them apart from regular stuff so you have to manually remove them yourself.
7.) It's a lot of work, but if you want something bad enough, you need to work for it.
8.) There is also a problem with level maps. The program loads all the models in the map, but they are positioned wrong. I can't fix this until a later time.





EDIT:
Program updated to support Meruru as well.

no problem. correct, for now, it takes about 15 - 20 minutes worth of work in your modeler per model (depending on how fast you are) to get the models like that. merging OBJ files, deleting morphs, finding and applying textures, applying alpha, etc. i'm glad i'm a coder rather than a modeler or artist since i setup a few of these models last night including part of a level and let me tell you after a while my fingers were sore like i was going to get arthritis or some shit lol. didn't happen to me not even once while typing some 6,000+ lines of code (plus several thousand more that I had written and deleted) to completely be able to parse that silly PSSG format. for some reason the japanese really like silly tree-based nodal file formats ugh.

Ah, one of the new Atelier games? Hopefully from your work on it there may be a chance to refine it and support animations and such as well. Really good work, though, sounds like it was a pain to get here.  Though, yeah, hard work pays off. =D

Yep yep yep. 2010 and 2011. I will work on the animations in late December when I have some extra time to learn PyMel.

thanks very much for your tool
I SUCCESSFULLY IMPORT THE charactor MODELS INTO CINEMA4D
I manually apply Textures 
I try your ripper.exe to generate a  .LWO file  and import it in
but it is still  no  textures.

then  i try to import background objects(house,ground...) ,it is not work very well.
they get together and hard to move to  origenal position also there is too much texture i have to try every texture to see if it is the right texture to the object.
any way to fix the no texture problem and ground import problem?

yeah, texturing is manual, not automatic. problem with these games was that the texture names in the shader nodes didn't always match with the texture file names. problem with world maps is that i didn't process the transform nodes. the level geometry wasn't spectacular enough for me to want to finish doing it. so what you get is model + uv.

Where are the textures? I extracted it and got a source folder and a totori.exe I don't know anymore what to do next...OTL I tried following the steps but...I only have the totori.exe + source folder.

This one is a biiiit of a necro-post I'll admit, but I just wanted to ask if anyone has the .exe and would be able to upload it, theres no DL link here anymore unfortunatly.
