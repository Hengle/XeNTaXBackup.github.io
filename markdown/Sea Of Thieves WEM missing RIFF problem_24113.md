Hello,
Sea Of Thieves has new expansion with super cool Pirates Of The Caribbean music.

I managed to extract the files from the insider built in WEM format.

However trying to convert them with revorb and WW2Ogg every file gives an Parse error: missing RIFF

How can I fix this? 

5 example WEM files can be found here [https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/ ... sp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1FMSjiS6GlhAeRO-sPjBrX17JTWGUiDPd?usp=sharing)

Any help is highly appreciated.
