Pit People's design.pak contains a ton of XMLs that define levels and properties of characters and items, and therefore it would be a good place to start modding.
A QuickBMS script for the game has already been made ([http://aluigi.altervista.org/bms/pit_people.bms](http://aluigi.altervista.org/bms/pit_people.bms)), but doesn't appear to work for design.pak. Most of the other files are still obfuscated with XOR so it's likely that this one is too, but with a different key.

Here it is: [https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B3e6_ ... mRtQW9DaEE](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B3e6_um64ExbSTJlemRtQW9DaEE)

Thanks in advance.
