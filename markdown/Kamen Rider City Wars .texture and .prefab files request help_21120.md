I extracted all the data, but I can only unpack the voice, model and texture. I have no way at all.
Attach an operation diagram for unpacking voice

Your request appears to be unclear, for me at least.

(For *.prefab 2 obj use the tool in the zip here:

I could only check the two samples you've uploaded - they were fine for me.

Use the latest version from the opening post here:
[viewtopic.php?f=29&t=15955](https://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=29&t=15955)

(Don't expect it to work for every model - it's only reliable for models I have samples of.)

I am using this version, and converting the two sample models is also messy.

Make_obj-KR.exe as of 14th September 2019, 21:22? Strange.
These are the obj I created from MDL__R00003_3.prefab & MDL__R00045_45.prefab:
.

I also used an older version of the exe (10th May, 2018) successfully, too.

Which obj importer do you use?
The one from Campbell Barton, Bastien Montagne, Version 2.1.1 should do the trick.

My file date is the same as you, but the converted model size differs by 3kb.
Blender open the file will report an error

(In your post as of Mon Sep 16, 2019 1:26 pm the Makeobj_log.obj had a size of 825 kB!? What did you change?)

btw: you need to close the exe before using the created obj (otherwise the file buffer isn't flushed which could explain the missing 2..4 kB)
