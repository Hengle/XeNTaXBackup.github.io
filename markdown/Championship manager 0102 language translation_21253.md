- Post Title: Championship manager 01/02 language translation

Hello I want to translate language file of this old game in its 3.9.68 version. I can open the language file in hex editor but like you know translation length must be same length with original strings otherwise the game breaks...Is there any tool for translation?I've tried langtool of the game but couldn't succeed.How can I translate it properly?

Thanks in advance for answers from now on
