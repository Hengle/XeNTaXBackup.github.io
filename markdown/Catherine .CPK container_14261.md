- Post Title: Catherine .CPK container

I have a problem with bgm.cpk package of Catherine game.

I tried to use Noesis and CpkFileBuilder from official Criware SDK. I have an unpacking error in both cases. Obviously the container has a mismatch common specification. As a result, I can't extract some files.

Perhaps someone has specification of CPK package format. I would be grateful for your help.

I found a bug. The problem with a file name in Japanese. This name contains an invalid for the file name character "|" (0x7C).
