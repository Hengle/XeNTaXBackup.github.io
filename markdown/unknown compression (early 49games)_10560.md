- Post Title: unknown compression (early 49games)

Hi there!

I've just taken a look at the first two RTL Skijumping games from 2003 and 2004 for PS2. They use version 1 of the 49games PAK format. These also use another compression, which is currently not supported by QuickBMS, only the newer versions.
I have attached such a compressed file. Can anyone please take a look at this? Thanks a lot!

Regards, Timo
