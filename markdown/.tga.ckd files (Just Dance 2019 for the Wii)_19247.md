Hello there. I've asked this on zenhax and got no response, so I'll ask here. How do you open the .tga.ckd files that are in the Wii version of Just Dance 2019? I've been looking everywhere on the internet for a solution, but couldn't find anything. Please tell me how you open them. Here's some samples: [https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/ ... sp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1LoijqshvY9U4APJn_0A-vjpmJrI5ts3E?usp=sharing)

The image data has some compression I'm not aware of
I just got two PMs asking about it- download TextureFinder (find it on web or here); 
Open the image, set it to DXT5, set width to 256 and offset to 163

Offset is wrong, but it's the closest image data I can get. There are several headers hidden inside:

```
SDD
TTVN
AAPMC
```

none of those magic's are known
Real image data offset is actually 172 (from hex data)
I'm sorry I can't help more, there's some different image compression I don't know.

I could take a look at Dolphin simulator source code...

[https://github.com/dolphin-emu/dolphin/ ... eneric.cpp](https://github.com/dolphin-emu/dolphin/blob/master/Source/Core/VideoCommon/TextureDecoder_Generic.cpp)

```
    // The metroid games use this format almost exclusively.
    {
      for (int y = 0; y < height; y += 8)
      {
        for (int x = 0; x < width; x += 8)
        {
          DecodeDXTBlock((u32*)dst + y * width + x, (DXTBlock*)src, width);
          src += sizeof(DXTBlock);
          DecodeDXTBlock((u32*)dst + y * width + x + 4, (DXTBlock*)src, width);
          src += sizeof(DXTBlock);
          DecodeDXTBlock((u32*)dst + (y + 4) * width + x, (DXTBlock*)src, width);
          src += sizeof(DXTBlock);
          DecodeDXTBlock((u32*)dst + (y + 4) * width + x + 4, (DXTBlock*)src, width);
          src += sizeof(DXTBlock);
        }
      }
      break;
}
```

i combined the critical parts of zheneq's Nintendo library with my script to open these images.  
this is the resulting Noesis python script that can also open your Just Dance 2019 Wii ckd samples.    
[https://zenhax.com/viewtopic.php?p=43370#p43370](https://zenhax.com/viewtopic.php?p=43370#p43370)

cmpa images will export as 2 files, the rgb color layers and the alpha layer,
you must combine these by hand in Photoshop or something.

Can you help me to open Just Dance CKD files?
