Has anyone had any luck deciphering the SWG IIF Files for Crafting Schematic Details? In particular, the ingredients and components needed for any given schematic, as well as experimentation values, etc?

I think the chance that somebody can help you is greater if you upload some example files.

In other words: Put some of the SWG IIFs up here so we can check them.

I was looking more towards those that have already been working with the SWG IIF files and are familiar with SWG. There are quite a number of IIF files for the game.

I am attempting to find the actual component and resource quantities needed for each schematic item. I am not sure if that data is in the IIF files, or if they are just a "skeleton" of data, and the schematic specifics are pulled from the game server.

I have attached a sample IIF file to this post.
