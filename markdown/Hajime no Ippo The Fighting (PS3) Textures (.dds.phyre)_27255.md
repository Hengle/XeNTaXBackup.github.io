- Post Title: Hajime no Ippo: The Fighting (PS3) Textures (.dds.phyre)

Hi! I'm pretty new to all this stuff, so please bare with me.

I've been scouring old posts trying to understand just how Phyre works, and I've managed to get a hang of it with some character model files from the HnI fighting game for the PS3. The biggest issue I ran into, sadly, was the texture files being .dds.phyre, which has been a giant gymnastic act for me trying to change it all to just .dds. Most tutorials are long old or don't work at all, and I've pretty much gained a headache trying to figure out how to extract the textures.

I couldn't get the files attached as a sample sadly, so my deepest apologies. If I can get it on some other file sharing site I can. I'm just (very desperately) looking for help on converting the textures.

Thank you!
