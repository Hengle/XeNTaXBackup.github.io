- Post Title: Devour Translation il2cpp

Can anyone help me modify this game? 
I try export TextAsset file raw and dump, both work fine.
I try to translate some text in menu UI and it work great.



But if I translate more, game broke the text or might be crash



I think the game only accept file size below default, if it go over defaullt size it won't work.
