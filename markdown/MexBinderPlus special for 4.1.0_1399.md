- Post Title: MexBinderPlus special for 4.1.0

Version 4.2.0 is not yet released, however , here's a MexBinder (+Scriptor) for 4.1.0 for registered users of MultiEx Commander. 

The binder is NOT backward compatible with MexCom 4.0.1 or 4.0.0 etc. 

See Help in Scriptor for simple syntax help.

I stumbled upon this today, a good excuse to try to get the big SRF's working again.
