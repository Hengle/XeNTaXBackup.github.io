- Post Title: Frogger 3D: .MWD

In the game Frogger 3D there's a file called FROGPSX.MWD. The Game Extractor website claims to have a plugin for this archive, but there is none in the program. I posted a thread on this a few months ago but I have no idea what happened to it. The header is DAWM, but that's about as far as I got. Any ideas on how to open this? I'd like to get some possible TMD models or something out of it.

That file comes from the PSX version of the game.

That file comes from the PC version of the game.

If there's no avail with the PSX version, try the PC version. They're two different files.

If you find a way to open it or at least get to the files, even if they're a weird filetype let me know how you did it so I can continue the research myself.
