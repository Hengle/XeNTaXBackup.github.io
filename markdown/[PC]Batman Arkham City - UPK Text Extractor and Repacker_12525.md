Hi all,

Here is the tool for Batman Arkham City to extract texts from upk files and repack them again.
But, you need to decompress upk files using Gildor's decompress tool.

Usage is simple

```
UPKTool.exe <upk file1>  <upk file2> ...
--------------------------------------
Example: UPKTool.exe WwSpch-TAPE_SF.upk
creates WwSpch-TAPE_SF.txt
--------------------------------------
To repack texts:
UPKTool.exe <txt file1> <txt file2> ...
--------------------------------------
Example: UPKTool.exe WwSpch-TAPE_SF.txt
creates WwSpch-TAPE_SF.upk.clxi

```
