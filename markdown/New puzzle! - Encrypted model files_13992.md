- Post Title: New puzzle! - Encrypted model files

Hi,

I'm trying to find the character's 3D model from the APK Saint Seiya - Zodiac Battle

I've found some files that I believe are the models, but they are Encrypted 

Those files are in CAB-HASH format with a _info file containing numbers (decryption key, maybe?)

I have no experience with decryption, can anyone solve this puzzle?
