- Post Title: Question about a particular text decode and encode

Hello
Most likely I'm in the wrong section of the forum, but I do not know where else to ask.

Is anyone know how to decode this kind of text from an android game?

```
dGKah0pL27x3khk7T+aEP8KYqS5dmcr5====
```


It was inside an XML file ''Game.xml''. 

Example of the code

```
<map>
    <string name="dGKah0pL27x3khk7T+aEP8KYqS5dmcr5====">ztBP2w==&#10;    </string>
</map>
```


I need to decode that text, edit, and then encode again. I have to mod a videogame savedata.

The game in question is ''Star Ocean Anamnesis''.

Thanks in advance for the help.
