- Post Title: Master X Master (MXM), Pak files.

Hello there! 

Tried a few of the extractors found around this forum and elsewhere, but I can't seem to find anything in the pak files, they're probably encoded. Has anyone tried to extract any of these, and if so how would I go about it?

I just came across this game, not a big unpacker myself, but I got nothing.. Anyone want to give it a shot, the game is free for download on Steam.

Did some digging around and it seems this was briefly worked on this in the past: 
[viewtopic.php?f=10&t=12220](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=12220)

There's also been some progress made towards cracking the encryption in [another place](http://zenhax.com/viewtopic.php?t=372). 
Maybe we can combine the knowledge from here + the script found in the bottom post of said other place and go somewhere with that?

The game itself if anyone wants to have a shot at it:
