Commodore Gaming is a daughter company of Commododore International Corporation, the brand was purchased by Amsterdam-based Yeahronimo from Dutch computer builder Tulip Computers,and Yeahronimo subsequently changed their name into Commdorore International Corporation. 

CIC can be found at [http://www.commodoreworld.com](http://www.commodoreworld.com) .They're planning to lauch some gadget that nobody will want. Reportedly, they also wish to leave the US Stock Exchange and concentrate on Europe only. 

Commodore Gaming is also based in Amsterdam and aim at releasing C64 games for mobile phones. They hired a Danish game developer to do this.

Now, apparently, Commodore Gaming will build high end gaming PCs. 

They will fail, and then Xentax will purchase the brand for a low amount.

Damn straight!  

What would we change our name to, though? "XeNTaX, the organization that pwned you bitches"?
