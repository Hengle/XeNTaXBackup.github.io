- Post Title: [Request] Diablo 3 Retail Installation

Hey,

I searching for someone who can help Installing Diablo 3 Released Version.

Because Licenes in Account's are now active. So if there is maybe a way to Install Diablo 3. I am sure you / we can play until they get it 

And we also would help the Emulation guy's with an decrypted Client.

You can Download Diablo 3 Here:

[http://eu.media.battle.net.edgesuite.ne ... loader.exe](http://eu.media.battle.net.edgesuite.net/downloads/d3-installers/589acdb4-c660-318a-b993-01528fad7da6/Diablo-III-8370-deDE-Installer-downloader.exe)

The Files are MPQE (Encrypted)

The Encryption Key is sendet from [http://us.battle.net/static/mediakey/d3 ... e-enUS.txt](http://us.battle.net/static/mediakey/d3-authenticationcode-enUS.txt)


tryed with OllyDBG but the Diablo 3 Installer Exe seem's to call other exe and OllyDBG got Terminated.


Thank#s a lot.

What do you want to check with Olly? There is nothing usefull. When game will be released, encryption key will be published on that web page and installer simply decrypts data. Like for StarCraft II. You can try brute force find AES key, but that's all
