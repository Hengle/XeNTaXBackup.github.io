- Post Title: Need help reversing an .sb file format (EA games, Sims FP, Sims Mobile)

Firstly, apologies if this is the wrong place to post -- I'm very new here, still figuring it all out. This format isn't strictly a savegame format, but it is a generic format used to store a variety of data. The file I'm currently focusing on is 'settings'.

I've written down what I know about the format here:

Does anyone have any ideas on how to proceed?
