- Post Title: COD 4 MW translation

Hello to all forum users xentax. I long ago wanted translate the game Call of Duty 4 - Modern Warfare. Found here on the forum program for Call of Duty Black Ops on Chronic. [viewtopic.php?f=32&t=5949](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=32&t=5949) I tried this program to extract text from the fourth part, it works.  The program is easily exported text a FF file. After translation of a few lines of text and importing an archive, the game does not start. Tested for COD BO operates. I contact the Chronic but Last visited: Sat Jul 19, 2014 12:31. Therefore, I ask your help guys. Can someone from the community write a similar program for exports and imports text for FF file. Have some scripts to translate this game. I would greatly appreciate any help. Help who than can.
