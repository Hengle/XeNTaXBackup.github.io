- Post Title: All Out Race 2 compression

Hello! Can anyone figure out the compression used in this game? Seems as if the first 16 byted hold some information. I tried comtype_scan2 but didn't find anything usable.
Any help is appreciated! 
Here are samples: [http://www.sendspace.com/file/mwmaia](http://www.sendspace.com/file/mwmaia)
