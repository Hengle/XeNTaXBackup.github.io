- Post Title: ZLIBC and COD4

I'm trying to unpack the cod4 ff files, while searching the forums I found info about zlib compression and the ff files.

Here's what I did:
I deleted the first 12 bytes using HxD.
I decompressed using Zlibc, but I get one big file instead of the contained files.

I cant find a way with Zlibc to get the individual files.

I also would like to know if there is a way to get out the idividual files without a hex editor, because I'm not found of manual labor.

I think someone created a tool for that, or it is contained in the mod tools, don't know anymore.
