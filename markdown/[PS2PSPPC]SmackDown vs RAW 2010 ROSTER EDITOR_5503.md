- Post Title: [PS2/PSP/PC]SmackDown vs RAW 2010 ROSTER EDITOR

I always wanted to be able to do to the SVR series what had been done to for example No Mercy for years. Mod it.

After reading and learning about how to hack different things in the game (great thanks to brienj for example) I decided to create the SMACKDOWN vs RAW 2010 ROSTER EDITOR (SVRedit) for the PS2 & PSP versions of the game. This because it is possible to play it on the PC with PCSX2, the PS2 emulator.

With it you can easily export and import characters from all Smackdown vs RAW games between 2006-2011, import texture edited characters (thanks to Tekken57/plodtrew's great x-packer tool), edit stats and names of wrestlers, edit moves, edit movesets, export and import and share your edited stats and movesets in simple text file formats and more. The tool is even possible to setup on a web server to be used by a modding team so that several people can be modding the same files at once.

Some of you guys may already know about this, but some may not so if you're interested and have a way to play a modded PS2 backup on the PS2 or on PCSX2, check out the link below. If you're into modding and like SVR2010 you won't regret it (I hope). 

Happy modding guys!

I updated the link to where to find the editor since it was removed from caws.ws.

Update!

This is an editor that you can use to modify your own copy of SMACKDOWN vs RAW 2010 for the PS2. With it you can export characters from other PS2 SMACKDOWN games and import them into your SVR2010 and create your own dream roster. It is also possible to import characters that might have been created by others or with edited textures. You can also edit the stats, entrances and movesets of all characters on the game and make them all playable in your game.

Some features:

    * export/import character models
    * export/import arena models
    * import character select images
    * edit names
    * edit wrestler info
    * edit stats for each wrestler
    * globally edit stats for all characters with one button press
    * edit movesets for each wrestler
    * edit entrances & music
    * export/import all wrestler stats & info, movesets and entrances
    * add/remove multiple attires
    * edit move names
    * edit move damage
    * edit move positions
    * network support for team projects

Please try it and report bugs.



Version 20 has the following new features, among other things:

    * Cleaner GUI (credits go to mastadon)
    * Quicker load times
    * Import character selection images for all attires
    * Import character images directly from the editor
    * Import will pad imported files to correct size automatically if they need it
    * Bug fix to always have correct valid import offsets (hopefully)
