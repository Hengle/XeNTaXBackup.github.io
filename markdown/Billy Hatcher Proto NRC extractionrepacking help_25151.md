- Post Title: Billy Hatcher Proto NRC extraction/repacking help

In the 2002 Proto from the Interactive demo disc, Billy Hatcher noticeably compresses most of its assets into 2 NRC files compared to final. In trial_stage.nrc they seem to contain;
-ADX (CriWare audio)
-ARC (custom archives that house nj variant models, textures, and anims)
-BIN (fog.bin, set.bin, light_param.bin, event_cam.bin)
-GVM (GC adapted version of PVM compressed textures)
-MC2 (Unknown, is stage defined instead of object defined)
-MPB (GC hardware specific audio for sound banks)
-MPL (Unknown, is stage defined instead of object defined)
-MLT (GC hardware specific audio)
-PAD (Player controls setup, probably for demo playback)
---
I'm curious what other differences exist in the proto compared to final, and hopefully this will lead to Billy Hatcher modding later. I have a feeling test maps are in the proto too!
