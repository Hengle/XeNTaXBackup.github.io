- Post Title: Disney Infinity 2.0 .tbody and .mtb texture format

Hello gods and goddesses, I'm hoping to get a fresh set of eyes on this texture format now that the new game is out. 

The TBODY files seem to be related (if not identical) to the ones from the first game that no one could really figure out in the previous thread here:
[viewtopic.php?f=18&t=10704](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=18&t=10704)

The hashes for the tbody filenames can be found in the mtb files although not always in the same place.

Any help figuring these out would be most appreciated!
