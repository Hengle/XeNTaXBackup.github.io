- Post Title: Legacy Of Kain!

Hello All,
You seems to are making a special kind of Extractor... And this is soo good damn awesome! 

I would love to see a Legacy Of Kain extraction thing, because I have this little brother and he loves that game, which I also do, and wants it to be a .little longer...

Can you help ?
