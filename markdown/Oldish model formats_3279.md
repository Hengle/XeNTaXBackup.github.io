- Post Title: Oldish model formats

I'm looking for documentation on various model formats I was able to find some already. I'm mainly interested in older model formats used in games like 
- Unreal I
- Lithtec engine (early versions) games
- Chasm - The Rift
- Tomb Raider I + II
- Alone in the Dark I+II+III
- Fade to Black
- The first Need For Speed games
- Destruction Derby I+II

Can anybody point me to any documentation on these or other (oldish) model formats?

There is one I can think of and that is the Jane's Combat Series SHAPE (.SH) model format.

Documentation here: [http://farc.3synergy.net/files.php](http://farc.3synergy.net/files.php)

Also, there is a problem with exporting UPAK meshes in RTNP where the vertices get all screwed up so there may have been a change in format there, might be worth checking into.

I have some documentation on Unreal I meshes as well in the form of source code.

Also:

Thanks for the reply. I played one or two of the  Jane's Combat Simulations series years ago, nice to see that formats been worked out. 
As for Unreal I models. Is the information you have accessible anywhere?
The Quake models I knew about already but thanks anyway.

Maybe I just post here which information I've found so far:

Yes, the Unreal I source is open to the public.

You may get the info you need there. I'm not sure if this will work to export models from Unreal I Beta though...
