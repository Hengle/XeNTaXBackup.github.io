This is a bms script to extract the assets of Castlevania: Lords of Shadow
I tested this on the ps3 files.

```
idstring BFPK
get version long
get files long
savepos TMP
for i = 0 < files
goto TMP
get NSIZE long
getdstring name NSIZE
get size long
get offset long
savepos TMP
goto offset
get zsize long
savepos OFFSET
if zsize == size
log name offset zsize
else
clog name offset zsize size
endif
goto TMP
next i


```

Great job! I wonder if it'll works on XBOX360 files.

It doesn't work for X360 version, or maybe it only works for demo files?

I get error: incomplete input file number 0, can't read xxxxxxxx bytes.

However when used with -l parameters, it lists file list correctly, so it seem it doesn't extract data...

there's a typo in the script. 

change

> log name ofset size

to 
```
log name offset size
```

Well it actually works, but I get error when trying to extract Music.packed, first file has space in its file name. Could that be an issue? Data00 for example worked fine.

And change ofset to offset didn't work 

EDIT: So English.packed didn't work either, and there was no space in filename....Hmm what could it be? quickbms -l parameter does however work for all files, including English.packed and Music.packed. But extracting works with Data00.packed, and I imagine with Data01.packed as well...

Here's verbose log:

Error: incomplete input file number 0, can't read 1362753026 bytes.
       anyway don't worry, it's possible that the BMS script has been written
       to exit in this way if it's reached the end of the archive so check it
       or contact its author or verify that all the files have been extracted


Note that if both the scripts and your files are correct then it's possible
that the script needs a newer version of QuickBMS, in which case download it:

```
Goto 8 0 ;
Get FNum Long 0 ;
For n = 1 to FNum ;
Get FNLen Long 0 ;
GetDString FN FNLen 0 ;
SavePos FOO 0 ;
Get FO Long 0 ;
SavePos FSO 0 ;
Get FS Long 0 ;
Log FN FS FO FSO FOO ;
Next n ;

That scrip it could be use also for repack, but there is 1 problem with filesize of some files. Bu they are exact the same size like it was just after extract:
Please help ?

```
       the reimport option acts as a reimporter and so you cannot reinsert a
       file if it's bigger than the original otherwise it will overwrite the
       rest of the archive:
         new size: 104229
         old size: 102588

```


EDIT : This is strange i have my file modded and it has 30KB less than the oringal and still telling me new file is bigger. Anyone seen this before ?

Guys I am having the same problem that michalss friend, when you import the file contents Data00.packed some files show the error message stating that the size is different from the original, but in my case these files are not edited, or are unique how can they be bigger?
Would fix this?

```
       the reimport option acts as a reimporter and so you cannot reinsert a
       file if it's bigger than the original otherwise it will overwrite the
       rest of the archive:
         new size: 141 (189)
         old size: 126 (189)

- do you want to skip this file? (y/N)

```


PS
File size English.txt was around 60 ~ 63KB larger than the original and was able to import successfully.

The PC demo available from Steam.
Unfortunately the dat files (.packed on console) still have BFPK header, but the version is 3 (not 0 or 1), and I cannot see the filenames inside the file.
Maybe encrypted or compressed.

Well i see names like (7C66E2C3D83B12F2.bik, 07E3A945F071A231.bik) in BIK folder. Maybe file names in archives just hashed?

How you did it? i can't i get errors
example:

unpacked the file Data00.dat with your script, this worked great and i want to add again the file scripts\preload_lua.lbt, i did:

> quickbms.exe -w -r castlevania.bms unpacked\scripts\preload_lua.lbt Data00.dat

and i get the error:

> - REIMPORT mode enabled!
>
> - open input file d:\Program Files (x86)\casteldata\unpacked\scripts\preload_lua

>
> - open script castlevania.bms

> - set output folder Data00.dat
>
> - the folder doesn't exist, do you want to create it (y/N)?:

Any idea? 

Thanks

Hello, can anyone give me cyrillic fonts for the game? I've made Bulgarian translation for PS3 and 360, but I cannot adapt the fonts from console versions to PC version. I see here some of you guys speak Russian and if you share your fonts from russian localizations I'll apreceate your help. Thank you in advance. 

Edit: Fonts are stored in Data00.dat

Just released an Unpakke module for the game. As much as i get from the thread the xbox version doesn't use structure encryption?
I was reversing the Ultimate Edition, and there was XOR encryption... does anyone know if that's only on the UE or something?

Would it be possible to decode (decrypt?) the config file as well in addition to the game archives, would be nice to know what's stored in that and possibly also the profile file.
(The game has two config files, one for settings and one for the user profile from what I can tell, also a .profile file type which might be checkpoint progress or something.)

Should be safe to upload since it's generated by the game and not part of the default files plus it's just a config and probably contains plain text once decoded but it would be fun to know what those contain even if it can't be repacked for making modifications or such. 

[http://www41.zippyshare.com/v/54172177/file.html](http://www41.zippyshare.com/v/54172177/file.html)
(The .localconfig file from the User\Appdata\MercurySteam folder and the .cfg from the Steam profile\user folder.)

Just asking, have been thinking for a few days whether to post about it or not and now I decided to do it, it might not be anything significant in those files at all but it would be fun to know what those actually do contain if they can be decoded without breaking the entire game or game engine down to get the data needed for such a task. 

Unsure if those files contains any profile specific or Steam specific info either but it's probably nothing important, heh.
(Probably just stuff for the game or the profile used for the game.)

I dunno what the algo used for .localconfig. Maybe aes with other key. I can't check because pirated (ALI213, FLT / Skidrow) versions dont work for me, but demo work perfect.

From what I could tell by the decrypted config file it contains nearly all settings minus the screen resolution so the .localconfig probably only contains that and maybe one or two other things.

The CFG contained everything from the game settings (Including FOV even.) to the key bindings (Both gamepad and keyboard.) and even a few things related to some multiplayer modes and other odd info (Localization and references to the KONAMI code the console version had, but I don't think it can be activated with a keyboard from what I've tried.) so that's been very useful to have available.

The Ultimate Edition uses a variant of the format, that isn't (yet) supported by the script (no names or TOC in header).
Can somebody please take a quick look?

Seeing as Lords of Shadow 2 Demo is out, I wanted to extract the music from it, but none of the scripts from here seem to work, the Jericho script posted on first page however only extracts 1 track before returning an error. Based on my inspection of the file in hex, there's 12 tracks inside.

Can anyone take a look at it and see if you could make a script to extract it?
[http://www.mediafire.com/download/rw0cj ... sic.packed](http://www.mediafire.com/download/rw0cjm8u927x0vr/Music.packed)

And another, main data file this time, none of the scripts (not even the Jericho one) were able to extract anything from it. Taking a glance at it in hex editor reveals it's not encrypted.

Thank you very much, will test it now.
And actually it's the PS3 version demo, but PC is supposed to be released soon along with pre-order page for LoS2.
Also Lords of Shadow - Mirror of Fate HD is coming to PC later this year too.

It's for PS3 version, as that's the one I requested it for and uploaded example files of.

Also, it doesn't seem to work quite right. All files that are extracted that are EXACTLY 64 KB are broken. Music files simply cut off at points they shouldn't, textures are inopenable and such.
Script needs revision.

PC version probably wont use compressed chunks, most likely it will be the same format as for CLoS1. anyway, kudos Ekey, you make life of many ppl much easier;-)

scripts also works with X360 demo of CLos2.

I take back what I said about PC version;-) C2 will have open world with no loading screens, so 64kb chunks makes now more sense. can't wait to see what they did!

PC demo of C2 is out. data is in .packed archives which has one difference from a aluigi script - extra 4 nulls after each file entry in table. sadly texts are not final retail and DLC lang file in english is missing too. format didn't change, so get ready for translation.

I see the high res detail textures in the 1 GB content\0\Data00.packed archive, but I haven't been able to locate the high res normal maps... can anyone confirm if they exist?

Well that would explain why some surfaces are so pixelated up close, how unfortunate if that's so.
(Normal map texture being compressed and of a lower resolution than the diffuse/base texture if that's all that's in the high-res archive.)

it's weird, I got this message and can not get the last txt files.



And also, at first I tried using Haoose's bms script, the game seems be able to load the extracted files, but when I use your script the game did not. I checked the extracted files and they seems broken or compressed. You can see the left wav files are not read/indentityable and the right one (extracted from Haoose's script) is fine.

Hm strange. You can see for example : on my screen offset for file language/portoguese.txt is 0x10674a85c but on your screen 0x10674a858 - difference 4. Seems not all files with FLAG 1 is compressed or bug with OFFSET. I check it later. Try this one

Any idea, how to change player model?
I tried:
1. Change parameter "_Dracula_Skin" in my save game. But it can be only "Alucard" or "Dracula". Affects armor color.
2. Replacing mesh files in the packed file. dracula.msh to draculaold.msh for ex. This method crashes game after intro video.
I think the player model is defined in the script of each level (\levels\levelname\scripts). But scripts are compiled lua and "unluac" does not work for them .

Can you make it to support Xbox360 font files? They are the same, just the names are:

x360arial20.alpha.dds 
x360arial20.alpha.mst
x360bradley47.alpha.dds
x360bradley47.alpha.mst

Otherwise your tool works with 360, too. No problem there. Just doesn't support the font files.

DLC content 4 Revelations is complete 'resource pack' to which games switch's when DLC is activated. to make your mod working for DLC just put it in DLC folder for example /content/4/ and name Data01.packed - works like a charm. there is also DataEnglish.packed (in console 64kb chunk format) which contains one localized texture ('no wolves allowed'). didn't tried yet to override, but even if had to be replaced its just 326KB.

Hello 
I wanted to open the file Castlevania Lords of Shadow 2 \ content \ 0 \ Data00.packed (1036 343 kb)


[quote]incomplete input file number 0, can't read 4 bytes.
anyway don't worry, it's possible that the BMS script has been written
to exit in this way if it's reached the end of the archive so check it
or contact its author or verify that all the files have been extracted
[/quote]


An idea?

hI, NEW HERE.
I been trying to get the debugmenu working in these xbox 360 games. I can only get it to work in Clive Barker's Jericho. By running it in preview mode. In the castlevania ones is it locked or something in the data file.

ok, I've managed to replace those icons and they show up correctly in game BUT text went crazy! It's unreadable! Can someone explain me why this happened? Does the  game uses some hash-sums to protect itself from altering any of the files?

Thank you!

My apologies for bumping such an old thread, but I can't seem to find anything related to my issue aside from another user asking help about what seems to be the same problem, and that's decades ago.
So to put it simply I've extracted the main data pack but all the .dds contained inside won't open normally, usually noesis does the trick but here even noesis doesn't recognize them.

So here are some samples, if someone could tell me what I'm supposed to do to fix them. Thanks in advance.

run this bms script on your samples to decompress them.  

```

comtype zlib_dynamic
get NAME basename
string NAME + _decmp.dds
get ZSIZE asize
math ZSIZE - 4
clog NAME 0x4 ZSIZE ZSIZE
```

Does each DataXX.dat/.packed has fixed bite lenghs? Cuz I hardly lost myself with trying to change game scripts. Game crashes everytime with new archives. I even tried extract all archives and delete them like was with Jericho, but this doesn't work too. I can't inject debug script into data without crashes everytime on start. Checked PS3 and PC. Help.

I've extracted all the files form Lords of Shadows 1 with no issues using quickbms, but I can't find Carmilla's files..

Am I missing something?

Cheers.

Hi, 

I've put some work in the BINK cinematics of this game. Those are 1280x720 at 25 fps without antialising. I've created versions at 4K@60 fps with antialiasing using a few AI tools.

Those new videos work because are separated files in the game folder. The only problem is with subtitles timing. They are syncronized using number of frames, so they appear in the wrong moment.

I've found the files where I can edit those timmings extracting files from Data00.pak using the BMS script in this thread. 

But can't find a way to import the modified files again without crashing the game. Normally, QuickBMS rises an error about new/old different size. But even maintaining the file size, the game crash in every loading screen.

Someone found the same problem in this thread. Is there an updated script to avoid this problem?

Thank you very much
