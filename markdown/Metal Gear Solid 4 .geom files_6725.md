- Post Title: Metal Gear Solid 4 *.geom files

I found some files on the MGS4 disk called *.geom, and I'm assuming these are model files.  However, there's a difference; the one I found on the side of MGS4, in the mg_setup folder, looks unencrypted (and small), while the one for Metal Gear Online is much larger (about 6 MB), and looks encrypted.  Is there a chance this can be figured out?
