Anyone familiar with this program and the executables that it creates?
The ones I am looking at vary from 8.5 to 11

I have several games that were created with it (mostly 3D stuff) and am interested to know if there are any tools for working with this format.

The final product is usually distributed as a single exe with the resources embedded inside. The idstring for the section that holds all of the resources is "10JP".

I don't have any examples on me since they're huge but I think just about anything created with this should be fine.
