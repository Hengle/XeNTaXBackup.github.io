Hi!

I would like to translate the Aliens vs. Predator (2010) game. I used aluigi's quickbsm script, and i got ".dat" files, that containing the texts. I am able to edit the original and the unpacked files in HEX editor. Is there any easier way to translate the game, or just the HEX editing. Thanks your answers.

I'm working on a text editor. Only DLLN and HTXT will support.

Not work for me in Sniper Elite V2.
I extracted the file with bms script and used tool in '0.dat' but show up 'Not supported format!' message.
What I'm doing wrong?

I made text editor, not ASR editor. You have to unpack the text file(s) from .asr files. The tool can handle the file, inside that Menu_En.asr. I tested.

By the way, upload file from game: [viewtopic.php?f=28&t=1270](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=28&t=1270). Rule #2.


Earlier posted tool updated, with a HTXT text file bugfix.

You used other tool?

I downloaded your file, to try out, and I could convert into txt the unpacked text file. So, the tool still works fine.

Try another fool, or maybe exist an updated script, or delete the first 8bytes ("Asura   ") of the asr file by hex editor, to get the inside file (this works if asr contain only 1 file).

The same, as you unpacked the text. Try out. Do not rename/move the unpacked txt file.

Can you update your tool to work with Judge Dredd: Dredd vs. Death?

Sorry, I can't do that, I don't have free time at all. 
If somebody know the C# and have free time, I can share the source.
