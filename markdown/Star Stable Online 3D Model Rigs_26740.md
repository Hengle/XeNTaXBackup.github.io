Hello! I am not sure if anyone knows how to do this or if this is even possible but I was wondering how I would go about finding the rigs for the 3D models in a horse game called Star Stable Online. I am able to open the models and textures in Blender, but I don't know where to find the rigs, if that is possible. I am interested in learning to pose 3D models in Blender. Thank you for any help!
