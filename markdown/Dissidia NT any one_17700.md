- Post Title: Dissidia NT any one?

So, any one have find a way to extract the models of the game?
Or more likely, anyone has found a way to "crack it down"?

I don't know as I don't have the game neither data of it (even I try to search a pirate version and I get nothing) so, I couldn't help on the topic.

Or we should wait for the PC version? (IF they make one too...)

It seems [someone on deviantART](https://yare-yare-dong.deviantart.com/art/Sephiroth-Operative-of-Legend-741690915) has been able to rip the Sephiroth model and ported it to Source Filmmaker. Maybe someone in here also has some idea on how to do it since this basically confirms it is possible to rip from NT.

I came here straight away upon seeing Yare-Yare-Dong's DA uploads to see if there was any update on this... 

Hmm... I hope someone can find out/share more info on this soon. At least we know it's possible.

There's [more](https://dazzyallen.deviantart.com/art/The-Living-God-742366705) people ripping NT models, however I doubt they'd give a hand to people from outside their circle or this forum at all since the same happened back when Final Fantasy XV's models were so hard to rip and only some of them knew how to do it. At least there's now confirmation that the Yare Yare Dong upload was legit (not that I had a doubt tho) since more people are able to do it. Let's hope some of them are frequent users here and can give us a hand.

Problem isn't ripping the models, but getting the game files. Afaik Dissidia NT can't be dumped using the publicly available jailbreaks. I think people ripping those models have access to a private kernel exploit for 5.0+, which would let them get the decrypted files.

It was the same for FFXV. Noesis was supporting FFXV, but we didn't have a way to get the files at the time .

Oh I see! Then the only problem we're facing is that we need a decrypted version of the game files but there's no public kernel available yet to do so, right? Damn...

What you expect? They're "pro" user of Deviant Art. Anyway, at the big end they make that big problem for the FF15 model and now they're public and all.

I kind hope the same too, because its more help here anyway.

I kind wonder do, if its so hard, then how more than one end up extracting the data of the game? But, for what I see and ask, I don't think they will help outside they so called "inner circle" as akderebur mentioned. 
I even ask Yare-Yare-Dong and well, [this was it respond](https://ageha-sds.tumblr.com/post/173270204390/it-is-possible-to-ask-you-in-private-if-you-can), so yep.


What I really found do, its this:

[https://github.com/gametoolbox/dissidia-tools](https://github.com/gametoolbox/dissidia-tools)

Its kind weird, because it was made by someone of this page. (I'm giving the link, because maybe they is someone that haven't notice of it too).


I could help, but I don't have the game, neither know someone were I live that has it and I don't gonna buy it when I will not play it for don't have PS4 and not like it too (oh yes, its only for the models  ).
