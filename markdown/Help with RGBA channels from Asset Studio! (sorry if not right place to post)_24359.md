- Post Title: Help with RGBA channels from Asset Studio! (sorry if not right place to post)

Okay so basically I'm a total beginner and noob at all this modding stuff. But basically I managed to rip some models and textures using Asset Studio. However, the albedo textures and normal map textures and maybe? the MRAO textures look off. The albedo textures are sometimes transparent? But with Asset Studio I can use "Ctrl + r/g/b/a for channel toggle" to eventually see it but it's not in the right colour. Like it's all green. Then the normal map textures are all red and not blue. The MRAO textures are all green (but I'm not sure if this is correct or not. I was under the impression the MRAO textures were basically specular maps? I wanted my specular maps to be black and white but maybe the MRAO textures are meant to be green)? 

Any help on editing the channels to rip the textures to way I want them to? Is this even possible in Asset Studio or do I have to rip the textures first and then edit them later? I'm not sure how exactly to edit the texture channels... I got em open on GIMP and while I could see the RGBA channels I wasn't sure how to actually edit em. 

This guy basically had the same issue with me for the normal maps: [https://github.com/Perfare/AssetStudio/issues/529](https://github.com/Perfare/AssetStudio/issues/529) 
but I wasn't sure how to actually implement the solution. Plus I still have the issue with the invisible albedo textures and the maybe right maybe wrong green MRAO textures. 

I'll attach some examples. Thanks for any help and tips, sorry if this is a really obvious solution.
