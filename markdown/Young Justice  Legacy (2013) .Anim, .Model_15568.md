- Post Title: Young Justice : Legacy (2013) .Anim, .Model

Greetings everyone!
is this a possible to extract models (with bones) or animations from that game?
Samples here : [https://mega.nz/#!qwgCjILS!Incvuc-MHiJN ... FW8cdlMbrA](https://mega.nz/#!qwgCjILS!Incvuc-MHiJNleyxGJXZsPG38YB-WAqP4FW8cdlMbrA)
Thanks in advance!
P.S I found an script here to import .anim files,but it's for Settlers 7,and only for Blender 2.49..

P.S.S 3D Converter ([http://3doc.i3dconverter.com/](http://3doc.i3dconverter.com/)) works fine with .model files,but models doesn't have bones.
