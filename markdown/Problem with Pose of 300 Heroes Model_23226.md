Recently i'm really interested with new game called by 300 heroes 
It really amazing game because almost all anime character include into this game
I try to download and get those character and got solution how to extracting game files by using script that provided by Mr. Chrrox
When i was trying to open .x files into noesis
The result is files opened successfully but the pose is not t-pose or a-pose just like usual model i always load
Anyone have solution for this??
