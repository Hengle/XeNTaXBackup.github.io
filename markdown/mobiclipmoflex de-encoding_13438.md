- Post Title: mobiclip/moflex de-/encoding

Hey Guys,

right now, someone is writing a decoder for the .moflex-file format (mobiclip) for 3DS.
It's already able to "play" the video on PC but it cannot convert it to avi yet.
I know that the coder of this decoder is very busy and won't work alot on it.
I would like to see a fully working decoder+converter and probably a encoder so we can create much better Fantranslations (subbed movies).
I've uploaded the source of the mobiclip-decoder, probably someone would be able to create a converter and a encoder for it?

Uploaded the source + Moflex-File HERE.

You can easily capture mobiclip video from this decoder via Bandicam, Fraps or other screen capture software.

Sure, but it won't help to edit and re-encode this format for the 3ds...
