Hello everyone, I'd like to get get the model, but cannot figure out how to extract the big 'gamedata.wad' to advance further, supposedly it contains the asset.
After some digging, it looks to be something related to ps23dformat, but haven't found a script for this game, even though there is a bunch in the zip I found lol.

Compressed asset 200 MB, uncompressed almost 600 MN :

Any help would be really appreciated ! Thanks in advance.

EDIT : the BackyardWrestlingDTTAHwad.bms extracted the file (from here [https://zenhax.com/viewtopic.php?t=8](https://zenhax.com/viewtopic.php?t=8)), but no luck atm opening the mesh file :

EDIT 2, looks to be the same as [viewtopic.php?p=149269&sid=18b83b959ddf ... 03#p149269](https://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?p=149269&sid=18b83b959ddf4c1b8c8e2759d5343903#p149269), but the script to import mesh is not working 100% sadly and does not open every mesh, when I export to obj there is also problem with normal, many thx to Szkaradek123 for the script

I actually used Ninja Ripper to rip one of the characters from the game:

It was difficult stitching all the mesh pieces together.

I've been trying to get my hands on Storm, Rogue, Phoenix, and Psylocke.

I'm somewhat clueless about the script you linked to, but If there is something I can do to help you in your quest, let me know. 
If you do manage to successfully export these models, the least I can do is rig the characters for you, as gratitude.

-EDIT- Unfortunately, I'm not able to register on the ZenHax forums. I've been wanting to ask them a load of questions. 
Since Blender recently had a major release ( 2.8 ), you can ask some people who are familiar with python programming if they would be interested in updating or creating some add-ons.

I went through many mesh, some mesh that I assume are character model (according to their file size) can not be opened, most likely because those models are more advanced than the other, with weapons/equipment mesh like Wolverine's claws, Bishop's guns.

Also updated mesh sample in main post.

For those who are wondering about how to convert .TXD textures to .PNG or .TGA, you can use the PS2 TXD Viewer 1.2:

- I don't know if it has a batch convert option.
