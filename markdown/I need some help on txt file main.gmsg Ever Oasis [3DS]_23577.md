- Post Title: I need some help on txt file "main.gmsg" Ever Oasis [3DS]

I've able to extract some textures, in ".ctxb" compressed on ".gar" using Kuriiimu. 
But I don't have any success in text file. Please, can anyone help with this? 
txt file is this "main.gmsg" Kurrimu can't be able to open it. I believe in some particularity about this file.
