- Post Title: Road Wage .RRM Model Files

Hello! This is an extremely obscure game and there's very little information about it on the internet, would like some help in deciphering this model format

I've gotten a note from one of the devs on the project decades ago and he had this to say about the format:

> The original models were built in 3D Studio Max, and likely converted from (.3DS) format to (.rrm) 
What I do know about this format also is that some of them have positional coordinates on them to determine where the power-ups are rendered on the model if it is a vehicle. Decorations don't have this parameter and loading them as a vehicle crashes the game. 

I'm looking for any hints and tips I could use to potentially turn another 3D file into this format, if it even is possible, or if the meshes can be edited and exported whilst keeping any other data in the model intact for mods. I'm not too keen on extracting them as Ninja ripper does a good job at that. Attached is a sample vehicle file with I believe would have coordinates for the power-up display. Thank you for any assistance! Would really appreciate it
