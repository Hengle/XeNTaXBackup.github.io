- Post Title: Edit .tiger files

Hello, 
I would like to translate my Larra Croft and the Temple of Osiris, I know I have to edit bigfile_ENGLISH.000 files, I found a program called LCTOTIGGERUnpacker_0.0.1, I extracted the files, but I still do not know what to do to translate dialogs and compress changed files to the .tiger file. Please help.
