- Post Title: Fullmetal Alchemist: To The Promised Day (PSP) .mdl Extraction

I've been attempting to extract models from this game and have hit a roadblock. I was able to extract the files from the 2 packages in the game files but have been unable to move beyond that. I have a large amount of .mdl files and the player and map folders which are clearly meant to be models and I cannot find a way to convert them in a way that makes them useable.

I would preferably like to keep the skeletons of these models intact as I cannot rig a model to save my life. If this is not possible though I will gladly accept any way to get them into a format I can use. I will of course supply a sample file. I hope somebody can help me out here.
