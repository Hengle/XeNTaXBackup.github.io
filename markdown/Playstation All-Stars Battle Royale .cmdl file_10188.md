I'm able to successfully extract and convert every texture from Playstation All-Stars but I can't get open the models.. They're in .cmdl format and I haven't seen any information about this format online.

it looks like this in a hex editor:

the header is MODL but I haven't found any information on that either

I'm using a pkg of the beta for this game, the .psarcs aren't encrypted at all in it. The psarcs only seem to be encrypted in the final game.

I have access to the textures too, they're in ctxr:
 (I resized this)

yes the first beta was unenrypted i already said this.
every other file is encrypted.
There is a script to import those beta models in the google noesis repository.

edit: this is only for cskn? anyway, it works, thanks


edit: no texture coords? that's sort of a flaw, the textures are a huge part in this
