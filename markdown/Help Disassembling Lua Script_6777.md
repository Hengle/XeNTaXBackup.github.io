- Post Title: Help Disassembling Lua Script

Hello, I didn't know where to put this topic since you don't have a forum section for it really. Move it if you need to. Anyway...

I have extracted a Lua script from a *.lvl file for Star Wars Battlefront II for the Xbox. I have tried using the software LuaDec to disassemble it, but it gives me the error "ifs_main.luac:1: '=' expected near 'char(1)'"

I have attached the file, hopefully someone more experienced can help me. Thanks.
