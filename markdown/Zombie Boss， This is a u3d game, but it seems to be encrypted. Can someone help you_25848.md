FIrst remove extrabytes in order to have Unity header, check in hex editor unity version, in this case 5.x.x.0.0.0 

In assetstudio Options-> specify unity version -> 5.x.x.0.0.0 -> drag and drop .ab archive

Could you please provide full game name/site ? So that ppl experiencing same problem could find out themselves when we say " google is your friend"
