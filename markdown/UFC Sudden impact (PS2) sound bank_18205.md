- Post Title: UFC Sudden impact (PS2) sound bank

Hi guys, I've got an audio archive holding most or all the sounds (encoded using Sony Playstation 4-bit ADPCM codec) from the game and I want to have it properly unpacked.
Of course there're programs like Cube Media Player or ADPCM Player v1.44h or even VGMToolBox but I'd not like to use them right now; such tools never provide perfect results anyway when they are used to scan sound archives for contained headerless ADPCM data.

[These are sample cuts](https://mega.nz/#!cMVzVIaL!Td_nwD36qlXWAEWpjTws0xTERCx9k2R6qDOntbefCjw), start + end of the said bank. Thanks in advance to anyone who's able to help me anyhow!
All the best!
