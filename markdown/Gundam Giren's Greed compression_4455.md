- Post Title: Gundam Giren's Greed compression

Hello,

I've been working on uncompressing the graphics and textures for mobile suite gundam giren's greed (PS2). The majority of the games information are stored inside of *.MKD files. Textures and images are stored in a format called MRG inside of said MKD files. I've found a tool, that will uncompress the images and textures from theese files, but I would like to able to do it myself, and possibly find a way to recompile them back into the *.MKD files.

I'll attach the tool, and if anyone is interested I'll post the header of the MKD files
or the MRG files inside of them

I'm also attaching one of the MRG files I've pulled out of the MKD file.

you can use the program I posted above to pull the images out of it.
