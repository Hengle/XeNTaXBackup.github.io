- Post Title: SEGA classics

I'm interested in getting some help unpacking Sega Classics games that I've bought. These consist of an emulator, DirectX installer and the game ROM.

The game file seems to be most often called g0011.pak and starts with the string PSCD if that means anything to anyone.

Am I able to get permission to upload the pak file here?

Thanks, 
Adam
