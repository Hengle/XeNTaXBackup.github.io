- Post Title: 3d via Printscrean - more information requared...

Hello, I just noticed that 3d via Printscrean isn't available anymore on the original site... and that's maybe not something new to you.. but well it's new to me... I'm searching for v 2.1 of the program and I can't find it.... I was wondering maybe some of you have it? Can you re-upload it for me? If my request violates the rules of the forum can you just upload it and send it to me via PM?
Thank you very much in advance.

Nope, although that page remains, PrintScreen was discontinued and recently removed from the site according to [this thread](http://www.3dvia.com/forums/topic/where-is-the-3dvia-printscreen-application-now) on their forums.
You can still get version 2.3 from [here](http://web.archive.org/web/20110717042507/http://www.3ds.com/products/3dvia/3d-xml/1/) though.

Works fine here, you have to wait for the archived page to load or click on the "Impatient?" button if you don't like waiting...

Here's a direct link from the archived page
