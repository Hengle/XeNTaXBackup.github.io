- Post Title: Help getting Dark Souls animation files

Hi! I wanted to see if anyone could help me with this problem: I am currently developing a Dark Souls clone, and I wanted to use the original game animations, just like this guy did:

However, I cant find a working way to rip these files to an usable format. Does anybody have them and is willing to share or have a working method for extracting them? It doesn't matter which DS the animations are from.

Thanks!
