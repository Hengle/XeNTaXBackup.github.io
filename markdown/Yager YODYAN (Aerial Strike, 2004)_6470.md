Sorry to bump this but I haven't yet found any information on the Yager model/animation format. Maybe I've missed something or nobody has looked into it yet? It is rare/relatively unknown/obscure title so I understand that. All I really know is what each are at this point. As far as I can tell, they aren't common.
