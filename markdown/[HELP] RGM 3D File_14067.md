Is it from a game ? 
You have a sample file ?

Something more than what you just gave us would be nice...

Hi thank you for reply ! 
Yes the "*.rgm" file come from Audition online game here is a sample of rgm ([https://www.mediafire.com/folder/505o78 ... z6q/shared](https://www.mediafire.com/folder/505o78v6unamm0b,73wydt59dv2373v,x6v7uu44f30sz6q/shared))
rgm file was made with 3DS MAX 08, I really hope that someone could help me with this file format because it would be interesting to know more about them...

Regards !

simplest format I could think of - should not be too hard to create a maxscript for it, but the models seem to be, well, a little bit ugly

Hi, thank you very much so i suppose i need hex2obj to open rgm ? i will try it !
But do you think is it possible to write an export script for 3ds max 8 that allow me to export a basic scene to ".rgm" file format ?

But for export (obj -> rgm) you need a full format analysis, I guess. (Atm I can't remember any format where the reverse way was done for in this forum.)

I see   i hope it is possible to write an export script since the rgm file format from audition is both 3D and Biped animation.
