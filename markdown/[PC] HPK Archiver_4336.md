I have another tool I created yesterday/today to upload but it is giving me a Upload empty on the forum and IO error on the blog.  There's something wrong with PHP/MySQL permissions.

HPK Archiver by FordGT90Concept v1.0.12

Version History

1.0.12: Fixed 1333 out of 1334 errors in Tropico 4: Modern Times' Expansion.hpk
1.0.11: Writes data to output that doesn't inflate (fix for DLC).
1.0.10: Separated Tropico 5 game option which disables "Compress It" when checked because the game doesn't support it.
1.0.9: Lots of minor tweaks in the code.
1.0.8: Cleaned up file system code (part of FragmentedFile now) and renamed a lot of variables to more accurately reflect what it represents.
1.0.7: Catches some files that lie about being compressed and dumps the headerless contents.
1.0.6: No longer creates a temporary file for fragmented files and handles all files as fragmented files.
1.0.5: Removed a temp file and cleaned up code relating to all of the temp files (three of them now).
1.0.4: Now handles fragmented files properly.
1.0.3: Tons of bug fixes including the ability to decompress/extract challenges and ShaderCache.hpk.
1.0.2: No longer crashes if the output directory doesn't exist. It will simply create it.
1.0.1: Added bug fixes for abnormal files in Game.hpk.
1.0.0: Fixed a bug with the time stamps when archiving and also added support for Tropico 4 (experimental).
Beta 7: Fixed a bug in the archival code. 
Beta 6: Archive feature is now functional, it automatically saves/loads settings, and many other tweaks.
Beta 5: Overhauled the GUI. It now shows statistics about the file and how far along it is while extracting.
Beta 4: It applies the "_filedates" to the files (modified date) and deletes the _filedates file because it is now irrelevant. Made the Zip decompression algorithm more efficient (one output stream per file).
Beta 3: Added Unix support for use on Mono.
Beta 2: Extracts all files successfully via C#ZipLib.
Beta 1: Erred on some files during extracting using zlib.
