Here are 2 files from NFS TR which are probably archives.

ShippingVehicles.sb & ShippingVehicles.toc which probably contain vehicle models and textures is way too big for upload -> 1GB:(
so I upload smaller files

Second this, a little script would be nice. Could the start of the toc file be a crypt key?

You can already decrypt the .toc files with a tool posted in the battlefield 3 thread.

I'm writing bms script for toc+sb unpacking, but unpacked content is in unknown formats and needs further research. I will upload some unpacked samples soon, so other members can join this research.
script is still WIP, sample output for now looks like this (parsing AudioSuperBundle.toc file):

```
   tag = 921C8637F079B2A671C062FC830B01AA
  Start of LIST 'bundles' with size = 23569
  Start of ENTRY '' with size = 126
   id = Win32/_c4/sound/memory/bundles/permaload_composite_vehicle_traffic_bundle_blueprintbundle
   offset = 0
   size = 1563696
  End of current LIST or ENTRY
  Start of ENTRY '' with size = 121
   id = Win32/_c4/sound/memory/bundles/permaload_composite_smackables_bundle_blueprintbundle
   offset = 1563696
   size = 3867808
  End of current LIST or ENTRY
... ... ...
  Start of ENTRY '' with size = 123
   id = Win32/_c4/sound/memory/bundles/traffic_composite_trf_trk_tan_10_bundle_blueprintbundle
   offset = 292983776
   size = 159136
  End of current LIST or ENTRY
  Start of ENTRY '' with size = 123
   id = Win32/_c4/sound/memory/bundles/traffic_composite_trf_trk_tan_95_bundle_blueprintbundle
   offset = 293142912
   size = 159136
  End of current LIST or ENTRY
  End of current LIST or ENTRY
  Start of LIST 'chunks' with size = 1
  End of current LIST or ENTRY
   name = Win32/AudioSuperBundle
   alwaysEmitSuperbundle = 0
  End of current LIST or ENTRY

```

thanks to mitsuhiko for info about this format in BF3 thread.

Man! I'll be really happy if we can extract files from those compressed files! After we figure out an extractor, of course someone needs to make a program to convert it to useful format like Forza Studio for FM3 and FM4 cars. Hope Oleg the maker of ZModeler 2 can make a filter for the extracted files. I really want cars from The RUN. Although few cars were just converted from old series NFS to The RUN like the GT-R which had false GT-R badge texture (Skyline R34 GT-R badge texture) like in NFS Pro Street, Undercover, SHIFT, and SHIFT2U. Although they put true GT-R R35 badge texture on NFSHP.. 
But all i'm sayin is... I Can't Wait until someone can extract models out of the game!

As I promised, the unpacked UI.sb, with bundles, that needs further reversing and unpacking (but format is not very complicated at first look):
[http://www.multiupload.com/KU6463PF11](http://www.multiupload.com/KU6463PF11)
BMS script is still buggy (bundles unpacking part is ok, but chunks unpacking isn't), so I'm not going to post it now. Maybe, if I finish it, I'll post it. 
A small bonus: [http://www.multiupload.com/CT1O4ALM35](http://www.multiupload.com/CT1O4ALM35)
Convert it to .avi with eaconv.exe

Hhhhmmm... if the unpacker is done... Will it extract car model and texture data(s)?
If it is possible, good . If we can also extract some dummies like headlight dummies, or wheel dummies (for wheel position), it'll be a hella nice work

Axsis how far did you get?

I wrote a python script using the libfb2 to dump out all of the vehicles... but I'm not sure what to do with the resulting files. Looking at them in a hex editor, they have all sorts of _c4/*** directory listings with blobs of binary. It kinda sounds like they combine all of the meshes, textures, and other parameters into these files. Any idea how to extract/unpack these resultant files into workable images and mesh files? I'd love to get some of these cars into GTA4, etc.

```
import os
import shutil

dst = r'C:\Temp\NFS'
idx = 0

BUNDLE_PATH = r'C:\Program Files (x86)\Need for Speed The Run\Need for Speed The Run\Data\Win32\ShippingVehicles'
"BUNDLE_PATH = r'C:\Program Files (x86)\Need for Speed The Run\Need for Speed The Run\Data\Win32\_c4\Blueprint\Metadata\AllVehicles_BlueprintMDB'"

bundle = Bundle(BUNDLE_PATH)
total = len(bundle.bundle_files)

idx = 0

for items in bundle.iter_files():
    vehicle = bundle.get_file(items.id)
    fn = os.path.join(dst, items.id)
    directory = os.path.dirname(fn)
    if not os.path.isdir(directory):
        os.makedirs(directory)
    with open(fn, 'wb') as out:
        print 'Extracting %s % 8d Bytes (%d/%d)' % \
            (vehicle.id, vehicle.size, idx, total)
        shutil.copyfileobj(vehicle.open(), out)
    idx = idx + 1
```

Ok, here is the script for unpacking chunks and bundles from toc+sb files.
Audio and video are stored in chunks, while textures, levels and cars geometry and other data are in bundles. There is no chunk filenames stored in .toc, only hashes, so extracted filenames will be like "1DBEAD526CD3C6A1652994ACAF4D3C76" - that's normal.
Bundles are unpacked with normal names like "Win32\_c4\ui\flow\graph\frontend\ferootgraph_resourcebundle". Any help on further bundle unpacking is welcomed.
Repacking using quickbms -r should work, but not throughly tested. (with standart repacking limitations like <= size of repacking file)
Use this script on original .toc file (not decrypted with bf3decrypt or any other tool).
Usually script finishes with error "incomplete input file number -1, can't read 1 bytes." - this is normal.

I found the filenames for the audio chunks in the Level SB files but as to how to get that out and match them is way out of my league.

Make sure to extract it in the same directory as the sb/toc files.

sobhannina, first make sure you're using latest version of [quickbms](http://aluigi.org/quickbms/)
if it's first time you're using this tool - read [documentation](http://aluigi.org/papers/quickbms.txt) on how to use it. in brief: run quickbms, select script file, select input .toc file, select output dir. exactly in that order.
output dir may not be the same dir as the input, just tested this.
if you still get an error, copy all what quickbms outputs in it's window and paste here.

yes, this is loadscreen bundle file and it means that script works well.  

> i really need it believe me or not ... maybe its funny but if i cant Edit this Game "NFS Run" my hole life gonna be Destroyed at all !!
so, do some research by yourself and find the way to unpack bundle files. save your life 
and don't forget to share results of your research with us.

Ok i do some researches and find that ... all of the games and programs out there uses Specific File Formats !
So this mean's EA or any Game company convert their files and archives into these Formats However 
Most of these formats are not "open able" in normal way !!! (i know its old news:D) 

according to this Web : [http://www.downloadatoz.com/file-extens ... nsion.html](http://www.downloadatoz.com/file-extensions/sb-file-extension.html)
".sb is a Signed Byte Audio File. Detailed information of file extension .sb on what is .sb File and how to open/play .sb file with no trouble. "
also : 
"SB file is 8bit sound data - Raw Signed Pulse Code Modulation (PCM) Byte format."

so here we have a fake info on this file ! or can think this way ... EA wanna fool us !:D 

by the way , according to this webpage : 
[http://mark0.net/soft-trid-deflist-s.html](http://mark0.net/soft-trid-deflist-s.html)

i understand that  , there are 2 different definitions of ".SB" file !

1- SB	 <======>   SBX SpinnerBaker eXtractor compressed archive	

2-SB  <======>    Scratch project  (a File extension can be used  and Create by Scratch programming language.)

So ... here is a forum that have some info about "Scratch Programming Language " : 
[http://scratch.mit.edu/forums/viewtopic.php?id=26096](http://scratch.mit.edu/forums/viewtopic.php?id=26096)


Can not find any Extractor or such thing yet ! currently am searching ...

.sb = superbundle. It's a proprietary format by DICE for the Frostbite 2 engine. You've already extracted the superbundle file. Your resultant file is a bundle file. As far as I know, it's not comparable to any existing file. Open it with a hex editor and see what's inside. That's the part that I'm stuck at, too. Not sure how to approach this. Anyone have any thoughts on what to do with the bundles?

I'm thinking that the binary blob at the end is all of the assets mashed together and the binary junk after each file name is some kind of pointer into the binary blob with possible extra parameters(?).

SnarbleBarb: NFS Hot Pursuit 2010 also uses bundles - but they're completely different to these bundles. Also NFSHP2010 was made by Criterion Games using their own engine.

I guess you'll need to manually sift through all that raw data - that's what I had to do with NFSHP2010. The only things that I found were figured out were: bundle format, texture format and models format. Everything else I had to figure out on my own (which is about 20 another formats). Heh, and still I'm far from finishing.

Oleg did look into the bundle files, but as mentioned earlier they are of no use as they are, think of it like a packed format that we cant unpack just yet

so unless someone figures those bundle files out, oleg wont be able to make an importer (related: [http://forum.zmodeler2.com/viewtopic.php?f=6&t=5434](http://forum.zmodeler2.com/viewtopic.php?f=6&t=5434))

white00gt, 3DRipperDX does not work with DirectX 11 games. The RUN itself uses DirectX 11 because of it's new engine, the Frosbite 2.0 by DICE. A modder of GTA IV once uploaded his Lamborghini Aventador mod to GTAInside. In the description, he says that he ripped it from Need For Speed The Run Limited Edition. But then after few days, i checked back and the car was gone from the Lamborghini section of GTA IV Cars at GTAInside. This could probably be a fake. But i already downloaded the car before it was gone from the list. The Aventadors which exist as mods for games now was from Forza Motorsport 4 as the LOD0 model with insane polygon (or triangle) count.

So, to sum it all up...
3DRipperDX does not work with The RUN or other DirectX 11 games. It only works for DirectX 6, 8, 9 games.

Working on bundle unpacking. Still in progress - this format is pretty complicated. And there is some encrypted data in bundle header, that, I believe, may be very useful.
Textures in bundles are without headers, so I manually added them. First 2 are from Lambo Aventador, last one is from UI.

Is there are a way to extract the sounds/Music assets like the ones that are titled: MX_ ect. and how to they connect to the ChunksAudio bank. Would you have to match them up with the Chunk ID and offset?

EDIT: just tried to extract the data from the 360 level files but it doesn't work. maybe encrypted.

EDIT. nvm works now. 

still weirded out about the sound data.

bundles can contain 3 types of data. one of them - chunked data (lets call it type3), like in superbundles (.sb) without names, only with IDs, and contain raw data, even without headers (textures for example). all info about this chunks are stored in type1 files, which are usually small. for now i can unpack bundles, with proper names for first 2 types of data, but can't match type3 chunk files with type1 info files even within single bundle

- Post Title: Re: Need For Speed: The Run [.SB & .TOC]

All sounds/music are in chunksAudio. Extraction is no problem with the script but the PC version uses a new variant of EA ADPCM so conversion is not possible, Also the music is splitted up into individual segments which are out of order so without the proper filenames combining those is almost impossible because the nams contain the proper marker order. On the xbox360 version the music uses packed EA XMA audio which you can demux with ea_multi_xma.

I have converted the music thus far but like i said i cannot determine an order to combine the dynamic segments since there is no names.

Hi, i'm new here and i was wondering if i can extract 3d models from NFS HP or/and NFS THE RUN?
I know that i can use 3d ripper ( max plugin ) but it's hard to recreate something like an whole game map for GTA IV.
Something like noesis would be nice though, i have allready been extracting RDR and FM3 models from xbox.

Thx anyway, i hope someone got answers on that..

I've unpacked bundles first, then added DDS DXT5 header to some of the unpacked files. These headerless textures exists in almost every bundle.

I think this is the textures! [http://www.mediafire.com/?1r18fsxwv4ex4t6](http://www.mediafire.com/?1r18fsxwv4ex4t6)

This forum does have an owner. It is not nobody's forum... Duh...
And please, don't go OFFTOPIC. This thread is to discuss the extraction of models, textures, sounds/music/audio/song, or language files from Need For Speed: The Run from .sb and .toc file which was actually DICE's Frosbite 2 format.

Want to think of what to do with the file extension ".Blueprintbundle".
With it, it was found that examine the file in Notepad.
Directory for the data of the car is a "bundle \ Win32 \ _c4 \ vehicles / nfs \".
In addition, the data shall be estimated as being used in the mesh (bb_lam_cou_qv_85_kit00.blueprintbundle)
lam_cou_qv_85_kit00_stream_meshchassis
lam_cou_qv_85_kit00_stream_meshbody
lam_cou_qv_85_kit00_stream_meshbumpers
lam_cou_qv_85_kit00_stream_meshskirt
lam_cou_qv_85_kit00_stream_meshdoors
lam_cou_qv_85_kit00_stream_meshinterior
lam_cou_qv_85_kit00_stream_meshlicenseplate
lam_cou_qv_85_kit00_stream_meshexhaust
lam_cou_qv_85_kit00_stream_meshwheelsfront
lam_cou_qv_85_kit00_stream_meshbrakelight
lam_cou_qv_85_kit00_stream_meshengine
Etc.....
Sorry do not know when or information was useless.
I think another thing I want to say is, if you can unzip and happy "bmsscript" a. Blueprintbundle. 
Many people have a conversion is from Need For Speed. Indeed, molding well to a small number of polygons, have the quality to other games and still not lose. 
NFS The Run also good model because of work now, hopes that can be converted.

I'm sorry in poor English that I use translation google.

It's already a lot of months after The RUN's release and none has made their progress to extract 3d data of cars with texture and music files.
Most Wanted is coming this October/November. Isn't it a bit sad that a modern need for speed's data to be un-extractable?
So far i only know that most NFS generation cars can be extracted (from NFS 3 until SHIFT 2 Unleashed)
Someone really should made more progress in this :\.
I know this kind of stuff would take time, but usually, reverse engineers crack NFS formats way faster than this.

Textures in bundles are without headers, so I manually added them. First 2 are from Lambo Aventador, last one is from UI.

I've unpacked bundles first, then added DDS DXT5 header to some of the unpacked files. These headerless textures exists in almost every bundle.

As Axsis said, he added DDS DXT5 header to some of the unpacked files.

Can anebody please guide me what exactly he wrote to the DDS texture header file?
And how he did that, means: he opened the dds file with note-pad and added DDS DXT5 at the first line or with hex editor?

Can anybody please give a sample file or a simple tutorial how to add header lines to the DDS files.

Does this game also have CAS/CAT files like BF3 does or only the .toc and .sb files? I made a tool a while ago that can extract certain files from BF3 (textures and the UI stuff) and it might work with this.

Actually I am much interested into BF3 Texture extraction, but nothing found till now, You are really great that, you made a tool for BF3, so can you please share that tool.  

And the NFS Run doesn't have CAS/CAT files.

> All sounds/music are in chunksAudio. Extraction is no problem with the script but the PC version uses a new variant of EA ADPCM so conversion is not possible, Also the music is splitted up into individual segments which are out of order so without the proper filenames combining those is almost impossible because the nams contain the proper marker order. On the xbox360 version the music uses packed EA XMA audio which you can demux with ea_multi_xma.

I have converted the music thus far but like i said i cannot determine an order to combine the dynamic segments since there is no names.

I do that but not all files wich result from extraction are demuxed.
Missing more parts from complete song.
How u demux all files extracted?

Thank you very much "aluigi" for the script.

I have unpacked one ".sb .toc" file using your script, then I got lots of files with no extension.

I am completely blank to recognize that, which are the texture files.

Can any body please help.

I have unpacked "Level_0100_SanFrancisco.sb".

if you have files with the name ending with "blueprintbundle" there is not much to do because they are archives but their content is still not useful for modders.
Anyway if you are curious:

"aluigi" 

I have unpacked the blueprintbundle extracted from .sb file with your "nfstr_blueprintbundle.bms" but still didn't get any texture file.

I got proper folder structure that, the texture data should be there, but the files which seems textures are 1 kb in size.





I am unable to know how to get the texture files. Please help.

If this is similar to BF3, the textures objetcts contain just the header, which references the actual data by GUID.

Thank you for the answer, you are right.

It's my bad that, what can we do only with extracted data, if that is not useable.

Have any body successfully extracted texture data from BF3 or NFS Run?

Was wondering.
Now that there is so much known information about this format.
Is it possible for the python script to be modified in such way like newer games, but with out the cas.cat file?
Because I have tried modifying a battlefront script and no matter what it will ask for those cat files, and even if I try to make the script to ignore cat file, nothing else will happen, kind of figured once it imports that sbtoc.py something shoud happen, but I was wrong.

What do you guys think, is it doable?

cheers

Thanks nitoiviorel for this great tutorial !
I wanted to check the files myself, but it seems it was taken down due to copyright infringements I think, I wonder who's monitoring this thread, from EA, maybe? hmmmm, but anyway, I am confused though as to why you posted the link with the files? files like that are illegal according to forum rules!
You need help in a specific way, where you trying to achieve something different?
What where the titles of the so called licensed songs, and why couldn't you get them from around like any other song, or are they available ONLY in this game?
Because they extract just fine from both PS3 and PC, yet I can convert them properly ONLY from PC version.

mono24 I apologize for sharing illegal files, my bad ! The licensed songs from this game can be found on YouTube, iTunes etc but I prefer listening to "EA versions" since they are mixed more better (they have no long intros, no "curse words" etc). I saw your LOG file, can you make a tutorial on how to extract the files from PC/PS3 version of this game ? Or it's the same procedure as Xbox360 version? Thanks for your help !

Oh there are so many tutorials here in the forum that its not even funny, just requires you know, a little bit of patience to go trough the steps, and no it has nothing to do the xbox version tutorial, those steps where not the way to get the files out in a proper way.
Basically the key word to look for is Battlefield 3 because such as NFSTR is part of the Frostbite 2 engine and there's lots of tutorials on what to do with the game assets and if you look it up what ever was used for the Battlefield 3 game it works for NFSTR same way.

How do you extract car models with this? There's no clearly written tutorial here.

Everything you need is right here: [https://github.com/NicknineTheEagle/Frostbite-Scripts](https://github.com/NicknineTheEagle/Frostbite-Scripts)
First you dump the game, then use the ebxtoasset script to get the audios in playable form using foobar2000/vgmstream.

Prolly dead thread, and the other one was about meshes, but I still wanted to ask if anyone would have a solution.

I'm trying to make broken dds textures of NFS:TR cars dumped with [Nicknine's script](https://github.com/NicknineTheEagle/Frostbite-Scripts) work.

I've noticed a pattern (maybe) that the broken textures share: among the defined values inside the .dxTexture, the "First mipmap" at 27th byte has value of 1.
Other textures work ok and their first mipmap is 0.

I tried looking at the chunk using ifranview, xnview and daemon1's Raw texture cooker, but it really just looks like this, like a bunch of mipmaps mashed together. The header seems  to be in order i think

(this is LAM_AVE_700_12_ENGINE, supposed to be DXT1. The name of the image is the name of the chunk, which is also c588ec3c-d94b-6da3-3488-b0fda4b25545.). I have a suspicion that the first, highest-res mipmap is just in a separate chunk from the others for some reason.

The funniest thing is that [Axsis had managed to convert these textures 11 years ago](https://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?t=7679&start=45), but they haven't been active since 2021.

Would be nice to hear any ideas on how to make this work ngl. [Here's the chunk file](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1z2WJRiOY6hyuWrvPq8tnACi2ExOxCi1G?usp=sharing), i can also send any other related file if needed

I'd suggest to open up a issue on his GitHub, who knows, maybe he'll get back to the script to finish it, its still broken in a way.

Well apparently the issue was that some textures are split by mipmaps between 2 chunks. The 2 chunks have the same name but are located in 2 different chunk folders (root/chunks and root/bundles/chunks). I'm not sure if it's a FB2 thing or just The Run's thing.

One chunk has the highest resolution mipmap, and the other chunk has the rest. You can simply append the smaller chunk to the bigger one and you'll have all the mipmaps.

So when you are merging dumped chunk folders, DO NOT replace the files with similar names, since they may have different texture data. Just leave both folders with chunks around.

The asset conversion script can be easily modified to get full texture data from both chunks. I made a modification for myself on a fork, but I'd rather wait for a commit from NicknineTheEagle.
