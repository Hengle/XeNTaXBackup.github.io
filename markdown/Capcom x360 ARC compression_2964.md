I have decompressed Dead Rising files, this is not the same. Dead Rising was zlib based. I am not sure on this one.

oh really?

Yet again, know nothing on compression :P, is their a tool for the Dead rising or did you just do it manually (i'm assuming there's a tool)
Is it on here?

Well if you could attach a small Dead Rising sample again I can show you. I didn't carry over many things over to new computer and wiped most of my data. I have a folder that still resides on one drive that is entitled Dead Rising and it only contains a few decompressed files. I am going by memory here, but I'm 99% certain I decompressed Dead Rising and Lost Planet with zlib.

As far as a tool if there were one it was only proof of concept and not what you'd consider a tool.

Just want to ask - anybody is still trying to break this compression method? I'm trying but without any progress.
