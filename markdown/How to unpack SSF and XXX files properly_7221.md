- Post Title: How to unpack SSF and XXX files properly???

Hi all,

I ve unpacked 2 ISOs : Mortal Kombat Unchained For PSP And Mortal Kombat for Xbox 360

For PSP version each files are in SSF files but i don"t find anything on google to unpack these SSF files.
I would like to import chars into UDK or 3DS Max.

For Xbox360 Version i've tried to unpack XXX files but certain files got some errors into gildor soft. Even with Umodel viewer.

Someone's got a solution?

Thanks.
