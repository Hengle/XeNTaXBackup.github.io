- Post Title: Dust: A Tale of the Wired West (.SND)

[https://drive.google.com/open?id=11a7K4 ... -bUSHnDVAi](https://drive.google.com/open?id=11a7K49gXiWMibsvdwUtftn-bUSHnDVAi)

This .SND file comes from Cyberflix's Dust: A Tale of the Wired West, which of course was made and authored on the DreamFactory engine. When played in Audacity on the VOX ADPCM settings, you can still hear the audio above the static at it's correct speed.

In short, what I want is a BMS script that can extract these files within this archive with their proper names and converted to playable formats. If not, in an alternative to the converting-to-playable-format-part, another program can be made.
