Tekken Tounament Tag 2 is finally released! So the quesion is - how to extract really perfect 3D models from this game (there is so much characters like Jun Kazama, Rojer, Alex or or finally Unknown that was not in Tekken 6)?!

Yeah, it just hit filesharing sites... I still can't buy it yet . Is it the same format as the prologue?

someone sent me some samples... same format as prologue... models are extractable, visible vertex buffers and index buffers that use strip-cut indices; hopefully chroxx or rich can do it .

The format is same like the tekken 6, but not matched completely. The models and textures are can be extracted, and the noesis is still works if you fixed the file head. 
There are so many items in the Bins, and I still have not found the character base files yet. Anybody know where are theyï¼Ÿ
