- Post Title: Saints Row IV .be_strings

Hi guys.

I trying extract text from .be_strings file, but it compressed, and I dont' understand what is compression type.
I think I'm stupid for this. Or, another thought, that Xbox-360 version uses table from .xbtl files for navigation in other files, like .be_strings and this can help with decompress or understanding what is .be_strings file is.

Can anyone help me? I trying translate Xbox-360 version.

P.S. Just in case I attach one .be_strings file.
