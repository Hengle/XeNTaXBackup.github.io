Hi!

This game was developed by Vertigo Games and published by Tencent.
From the preview of .vpak files in Hex Editor, it can be seen that 3D model files are in .nif format, which is identical to BlackShot model file format.
Texture files are in .dds format and Audio files are in .wav.
WOZ probably uses the same engine as BlackShot does.
.nif model files can be viewed and exported using NifSkope or 3DSMAX with nif plugin.
However, unlike BlackShot, all the game assets of WOZ are compressed in these .vpak archives.

Any ideas?

Sample files:

Thanks a lot!

I'm sorry to bother you, but I like this game very much. Where can I find the server code for this game? Do you have any good ideas for me to find it
