I did it using NOTEPAD. The text you want to edit, needs to have the same chars as the original. For example the text says NEXT TIME ON, there you got 12 chars and you need to replace it for other 12. Example in spanish: PRÓXIMAMENTE (12CHARS). If you replace it for more or less chars the game will crash itself. So there you go. You can open it with, notepad++, notepad or Hexeditor. Is the same thing. So... bye bye.
