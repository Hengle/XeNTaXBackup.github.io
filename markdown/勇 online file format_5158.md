- Post Title: 勇 online file format

anyone can help me here? what kind of file format is this?  
s_w_sc_ccb.mxf                < 3d file
W_sc_ccb_body_a.mtf       < texture file
W_sc_ccb_body_a_s.mtf    < texture file
i get it from 勇 online [http://www.yong-online.com.tw](http://www.yong-online.com.tw)
last time they are using direct x file for 3d formats and dds for textures. 
but this month when they release new update. the latest 3d and texture file format changed.

i put a link on sample files. i also included the game.exe of the game. 
i also included the .cps file of the game. this cps is the file that open mesh in game
if u will open the CPS file on hex editor you can still see the original file name. (.X)  and on part below texture name is still (.dds)

hope someone can help me with this   

sample files
