- Post Title: Twisted Metal: Black BNK sound files

Hello, ladies and gentlemen! I am new here, but I am also a member of the Twisted Metal Alliance, FanFiction, YouTube, DeviantArt...list goes on...

I am just wondering what would be a good program that would play BNK sound files. I found these in the Twisted Metal: Black game disc after I inserted it into my computer. I was able to convert the VAG files to WAV, thanks to MFAudio. The BNK files must be all the various in-game sounds such as explosions, vehicle engines, weapons, etc.  I will need something that can play those sound files, and perhaps convert them to WAV

Thanks!

Can you post a sample of such file?

If I was to play it in programs such as MFAudio, we would receive such an unpleasant sound of loud static. foobar2000 would not play BNK files for any reason.

I'll just hand you the files right on the spot. If you are able to figure out how to play them, tell me.

I don't know what is MFaudio, but these banks contain the most usual PS 4-bit ADPCM sounds, which are convertable with vgmtoolbox. I think there must be some tutorials on that, because 100's of games use this.

I'd be glad to use vgmtoolbox once I get a new Windows, DANG IT!

Yep, these are all of them. Although, there is another game after this that I'd like you to do the same too. After all that, nothing else. Thank you for your cooperation.

They all came out perfectly! All the WAV files play bundles various sound effects, so I'll have to separate them using Adobe SoundBooth. One WAV file for each and every little sound (WHEW!), that will make them more usable in a fan-made Twisted Metal game.

I'll only ask you to do one more game, then I'll let you go.

There must be a way to separate them during extraction, because the game has this info somewhere, but I hope its not too hard for you to do it in audio form.

Could you please tell me how I could convert the SHELLMUS.BNK file to play the main menu theme for Twisted Metal: Black, using VGMToolbox? I'm having serious trouble trying to do it myself.

Here'a a link for the folder containing the SHELLMUS.BNK file, along with other sound effects, that have been extracted using PSound:

Hey !! Guy, I wrote a bat script to batch convert bnk to wav, you can try it.

It downloaded successfully, sent me to mediafire and I managed to download it, thank you very much. You helped me out a ton today, I appreciate that.

By the way, what's this tool suppose to do exactly, will it convert the SHELLMUS.BNK file to play out like the Main Menu Theme for Twisted Metal: Black, or just extract the audio files stored within, because I already have such audio files extracted, through PSound.

Also, What command do I enter in the cmd prompt for the bnkextr.exe or test.exe to extract SHELLMUS.BNK? When I hover the .BNK file over any of the .exe programs, to open and extract, nothing is extracted, please help.?!

Double-click the .bat file and press Enter, the script will run

The tool does not support batch conversion of .bnk audio, so I wrote a bat to support batch

Yeah, I have a problem, there's some error message stating "A sub-directory or file sounds already exists". Along with, "The system cannot find the file specified", a duplicate file name exists, or the file cannot be found." Is there something wrong here?

This is not a regular bnk. The header does not have BKHD. I can write a script to merge the bnk files. Then you can use PSsound to extract them all at once. Can you upload 3 bnk files to me? I want to test

But I already ran the SHELLMUS.BNK file through PSound sometime ago, and it extracted 40-something wav files. What I'm really wanting is the main menu theme for Twisted Metal: Black, fully extracted, played out like it does in-game.

Create a new txt copy code, modify the suffix to .bat,Put the bnk file in the place of the .bat file, double-click, it will merge all bnk into merge.bnk, you use PSsound to extract.

```
ren merge.txt merge.bnk
```

Well, it worked, I got them as "separate wav audio formats", but it didn't play out as I thought it would. You see, I wanted the audio files to play out combined, and in a pattern, just like the main menu theme for Twisted Metal: Black in-game, like for this YouTube video:

[https://youtu.be/zmMu02B5Tn8?t=7](https://youtu.be/zmMu02B5Tn8?t=7)
