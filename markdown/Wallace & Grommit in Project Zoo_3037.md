This looks like IMA-ADPCM, 4-bit stereo (separate: 16384 bytes of left, then 16384 bytes of right, and then left). I am not completely sure, though. I don't know if any programs can decode this already, but I could try to write one if you want.

Ack... I should have looked around first. This could be the FMOD Sample Bank format. Here is the FMOD site, where you should find a tool to extract it: [http://www.fmod.org/index.php/download](http://www.fmod.org/index.php/download)

I hope this is the right format, but if it isn't, I will still write the program.

Nope. I spoke too soon. This format has nothing to do with FMOD. Please disregard my last post.

Well, this works, a little bit. I don't have the audio decoding exact (by far) but at least you can hear the music. It may not even try to decode every file.
