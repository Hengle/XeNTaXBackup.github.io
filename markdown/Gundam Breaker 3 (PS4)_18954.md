Tools for Gundam Breaker 3 (PS4) models



1. Extract model/material files from GxArchivedFile00x.dat with gundam_breaker_3_mdc.bms
2. Extract texture files from GxArchivedFile00x.dat with gundam_breaker_3_tex.bms
3. Rename textures from hashed names to proper names with .BAT files
  (note that some TEX will have duplicate names, so take care of it somehow)
4. convert textures with GundamBreaker3_TEX_conv.bms
5. convert models with GundamB3.exe
  (noesis plugin for improved ascii format with bone rotaitons included)

To find textures for a certain model, open corresponding MDC in notepad - you will see its texture names

Do you need an iso of the game in order to do this?

please help！！！
I dragged the MDL file or MDC file onto GundamB3 and nothing happened. I reported an error when running GundamB3 on CMD:
Unhandled Exception: System.IndexOutOfRangeException: Index was outside the bounds of the array.
   at GundamB3.GundamB3.Main(String[] args)
how to fix this problem?
