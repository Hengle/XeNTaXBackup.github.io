Ryder BXML Convertor
The program converts any binary xml files in the Dirt/Grid/Dirt 2/F1 2010/Dirt 3/F1 2011/Dirt Showdown/F1 2012 games.


Ryder CTF Editor
With this program you can edit CarTuningFile (CTF,CSV) files for the Grid/Dirt 2/F1 2010/Dirt 3/F1 2011/Dirt Showdown/F1 2012 games. These files contain car performance data.


Ryder Database Editor
This program will allow you to edit the database.bin file from Grid/Dirt 2/F1 2010/Dirt 3/F1 2011/F1 2012. In the file you can edit tons of things like car restrictions for events, ai skill levels, new liveries(no longer replace existing) and so much more.


Ryder JPK Extractor
Untouched since March of 2011, I never got around to completely finishing, and releasing it. I still don't have the time to, but it works, and opens JPK files, the most important of which is "raceload.jpk".


Ryder Language Editor
This program provides a nice GUI for editing language files for the Grid/Dirt 2/F1 2010/Dirt 3/F1 2011/Dirt Showdown/F1 2012 games.


Ryder PSSG Editor
This program opens PSSG files for the Dirt/Grid/Dirt 2/F1 2010/Dirt 3/F1 2011/Dirt Showdown/F1 2012 games.


Ryder Mod Manager
This program lets you easily organize your mods for a multiple amount of games and install/uninstall them with a click of a button without having to worry about backing up/restoring.


Fergo BinXML
NOTE: Some XML files are incorrectly converted by this program. BXML Converter is more up to date. I'm providing it here to pay respect to Gulbroz for original application 

Fergo's BinXML allows you to visually select multiple XML files to encode/decode, with a very simple and straightforward interface. Gulbroz is the actual author of the bin to xml converter and Fergo is the author of the UI.
