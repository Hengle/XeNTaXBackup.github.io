- Post Title: EA .O files

Hey all,

Does anyone know how to extract a model from Electronic Arts .O files?
For example - (Def Jam Fight for NY) 

Here is a snip of the contents of the .O file which looks like Chinese to me - no pun intended hehe.

1) Wrong section.
2) EA .O files > it's object (models) - Try OIFTool. Is a program that converts .o files containing 3D models that are used in EA's graphics library to a .oif file
