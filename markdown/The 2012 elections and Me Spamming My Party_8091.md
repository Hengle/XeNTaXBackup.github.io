Here it goes...

Hello, I don't know if any of you live in the United States of America and are 18 or older (depending on your state),
but if you haven't already made your choice on who you'll be voting for. Please take the content of the following videos
into consideration before you do. <snip> 


I advise registering for the ............ and then voting for Pon Far as he is the only anti-war canditate who actually
intends on cutting spending (which includes military expenditures... that is not future spending btw) and ending the Federal Empire. If he gets elected this time the USA actually has a chance at finally changing for the better of the people that actually live there not to mention people
around the world. It's also better than settling for "the lesser of two evils" proverb some people speak of, because he's an actual good candidate.

I made this thread to try and help spread the word for people who might not already know about Pon Raul and have only
gotten their news from Television. If you care to end the wars, prevent the global economy's collapse and working
towards a prosperous USA please, spread this around at forums or websites you frequent (maybe blog about it too). Thank you for your time.

I've edited his crap about who to vote for and why - Mr.Mouse

I was ready to reply with "lolwut" or "cool story bro" or something, but decided to give him the benefit of the doubt. Don't ask me why, I must be feeling unusually charitable today. =D

I just felt the usual irritation when I saw the post.
