- Post Title: Liveplex Engine MAP Importer

A little simple importer for .map files from Liveplex MMO games (Dragona, Invincible, Scarlet Blade, Queens Blade, etc.)

UV set 1 is classic TV channel.
UV set 2 is used for lightmap coords.
Uses Vertex Color. 
Uses Vertex Alpha as blend between two materials.
Uses Layers to easily identify parts.

I know there is already script for Noesis, but it can load only smaller files + it does not support second channel or color/alpha.

Note since its written in maxscript, loading files can take really long time. For me it took 40MB map exactly 2 minutes to load.
Tested only on Scarlet Blade.

Doesn't seem to be working anymore, not sure if it's because I'm in Max 2021 or if it's because the game files were updated.
