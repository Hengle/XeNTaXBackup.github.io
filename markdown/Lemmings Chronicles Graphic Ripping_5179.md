- Post Title: Lemmings Chronicles Graphic Ripping

OK, so I was was looking through my copy of Lemmings Chronicles when I stumbled upon a couple .PCX files in the folder called FRONT.
So I converted them to PNGs with XnView, nothing too special.

Then I went to the folder called MOVIE and found a couple of .FLI files. You can play them with Quicktime Player.
