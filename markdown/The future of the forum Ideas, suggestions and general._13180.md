Hi everyone, time for a number of poll questions to determine the future of the forum. 


What suggestions or ideas do you have for the forum, what are your thoughts in general?
This is an open topic. 

Also make sure to answer the following other questions:
[Question 1: How often do you come here?](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=28&t=13175)
[Question 2: What age are you in years?](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=28&t=13176)
[Question 3: Why do you come here?](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=28&t=13177)
[Question 4: Should the forum continue?](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=28&t=13178)

I think the fact that there even exists a forum dedicated to the research of game file formats is amazing. This forum is like an oasis in a desert.

33% of my programming knowledge is based on the posts from this forum. It is wonderful place for begginers and professionals too. Things should stay as they are in this moment.

I've definitely put <insert Xentax related forums/apps/stuff here> to the test on games in the past, but frankly have found it somewhat lacking in terms of resolving my issues with newer games. Modding in general is catching on, so a lot of newer games come with tools to do just that.
Where Xentax could still provide useful help is in the exceptions - pulling models from Mass Effect to use for cosplay templates or the like.

One thing that always comes to mind when I read the words "Game Research Forum" is the idea of research into the more abstract aspects of gaming and video games. Forward-looking research into what games actually mean and do and how they can be improved and leveraged for particular purposes. As a developer - I want a "Game Research Forum" where we study and discuss and research things like improving player involvement, emotional or psychological investment, avoiding the uncanny valley in graphics quality (or the importance of graphics quality in the first place). What are games going to look like in 5 years? What should games look like in 5 years? How can we develop those games?

I suppose that's a bit too far away from what Xentax was created for or what most people use it for. But those three words kind of inspire that in me. I would LOVE to be part of a forum or "think tank" that ontologically brooded over the nature of video games and their relationship to the human condition.

All I can think about is doing something about this antiquated Subsilver look that looks too much like a vanilla phpbb installation with a duke on top

Don't get me wrong, I don't mean a photoshop filter style with gifs and outdated modern looks tacked onto it standard for "cool theme skins", and I don't mean a mobile-focused web 3.0 site excising functionality and having javascript ajax popups demanding your email obscuring everything, either.


I don't go here much anyway so take this with a grain of salt.  I'm only here occassionally for exporting pipeline issues (with original work) which I haven't really ran into much of lately.  Xentax is the only forum I get emails from.

Just based on question 4 I get the feeling that the interest in maintaining the website is waning.  But, it does have a rather unique place in the internet, being focused on reverse engineering existing game files.  I don't know of any other site that is remotely comparable.

I'm probably one of the older members on the forum, but one thing I noticed is that the information people have on reverse engineering is pretty tightly guarded.  I understand why; it takes a lot of time and effort to crack these nuts sometimes.  I ended up learning and creating my own tool to get Cryengine files as a result of not getting very far asking others for help (posted under the general tools section!).   And then I posted it up on github so everyone else can take a look, extend it, etc.  Not that anyone has yet, but in theory it's there!  Most of the other tools people use here aren't shared as freely.  Just the tool itself, and none of the parts that could help people learn.

I get it.  We spend a lot of time and want credit for what we've done.  But there does seem to be a silo mentality around this information, and to just give it away to someone who doesn't know the difference between a pointer and an int... yeah.  You'll always run into those people; they don't want to learn; they just want to do.  But they are an essential (and inevitable) part of any group.

I don't know... I haven't been here long.  But this site gave me the encouragement to develop my own tool.  Not because people were willing to teach, but because they weren't.  It would be a shame if it went away.  

It probably does need a rebranding and a look refresh.  Maybe make this the go to place for mods like Skyrim, Kerbal or Fallout type games.  The programming side, to complement the data side.  A whole new audience of people looking to figure out how to make useful mods on top of accessing game files.

There is no easy answer, but I'd consider it a big loss if the site went away.

If you're looking for a community based around this kind of stuff, Xentax is really one of the only places for it. I mean, between the collection of very talented and knowledgeable people in a setting based on helping each other out and sharing knowledge, there is something extremely valuable here.

If nothing else, just the information and work done here in these forums are extremely valuable, if Xentax was to ever go and no backup/archive was left in it's place it would really be a very sad loss..

I'm a translator, and I translate games as a hobby and to help others play the games they love, or to introduce them to awesome games. Sometimes it's not easy, because I need new tools, programs and such to even be able to edit a game's files.

When I first came here it was about some PSP stuff I guess, back in the days. Then I first posted on how to extract XNB font files from Magicka. Lots of people were helpful, and even I learned a thing or to, but sadly I'm not a coder, and I find it hard to learn. That's why most of the time I create topics to ask people to help me.

I know that people do this on their own free will, but I've made topics noone answered, so I've put a little incentive saying I'll pay them for it. Not so long after a new rule came out stating you can't ask for money or pay people to do these programs. I know it's illegal, but giving something in return is in my nature, and I think it will drive the community forward. Yeah, it may be a small amount, but giving appreciation other than a little "Thank you!" might be good for some people.

With that being said, I still visit these forums weekly, looking for new methods on newer and older games, too. I create topics asking for help, and I get help most of the time.

In general, I love this place, and it helped me out a lot, and I learned a thing or two with game translations. Thanks guys!

You ask about the future, but you aren't just asking out of curiosity...  Ain't no fortune teller around i fear, but let me tell ya my personal thoughts...

If Money is a Problem then maybe the Hosting is too expensive? I used to have a Forum with well over 20,000 members hosted on lunarpages, costed me 4.95 USD per month and i got actually much more donations from users.

If time is a Problem as in doing phpbb updates, backups, etc - then i suggest ask the users, I am sure you could find a Veteran user who would gladly take over.

Xentax is pretty unique, there's no other Forum or Website that could fill the gap if it closed down.


Whatever your reasons are to play the "might give up" Card - I'd really appreciate it if you would give the Forums into "Good Hands", i.e. someone here who is really "dedicated" to what we do here and Long enough here and well respected by the community.

People come to xentax for model extraction scripts (32,000 and 26,000 posts in Game Archive and 3D Models respectively), and the releases here have really slowed down a bit. I don't really post any tools anymore because I've seriously gotten bored of the "find vertex buffer," "find index buffer," "find bind pose matrices," etc. routine. After a while it gets really boring and then you ask yourself, "Why are you wasting your life away like this?" I think even Chris has gotten bored too. Don't you have a PhD in Biochemistry or something like that Mr. Mouse? Don't you ask yourself when you make those MexScript (or MultiEx or whatever it's called) Youtube tutorial videos on extracting data from archives, "Why am I doing this simple shit when I have a PhD?" and "Why am I sitting here finding offsets in some hex file and dumping its contents to a file, for which any CS201 student can do?" Don't take this the wrong way Mr. Mouse, as I have a lot of respect for you, Chris, Rich, and all the other guys who do stuff here, but when I watched you on that Neptunia extraction video I cringed thinking this guy has a PhD. It was like seeing a doctor (who is supposed to do surgery) doing the job of a nursing assistant (cleaning up poop from some fat patient's ass).

So the site needs some new blood, some new people every once in a while, and the forum really hurt itself with the donation paywall and the mass deletion of links (which also deleted some tools too). Also, the removal of Noesis, for which Rich used to come here often enough to give people good advice. The site can't stand with a few active members writing all the tools, as this site has become dependent on the same few members who are willing to work on multiple games (since there aren't enough new people who come here to do just one game). Also, the loss of Luigi too maybe could have been handled better and in a more friendly way as well. Well, a lot has happened here the last year or two, and I'm not sure how the site could be made back to the way it was 4 or 5 years ago, but I'd start with getting Rich and Luigi back on the site he he he.

Meh, I'm rambling now.

yeah, I've had this strange feeling from the very beginning of this year that 'something' is going on.
Too few members who contribute too many who only come to have some of their wishes fulfilled.

Too many of them seem to expect it as 'a service' that they are entitled to.
It's a 'spirit of age' or of a new generation, I guess.

I'd like to thank Mr.Mouse for his tremendous efforts to keep this forum going on all these past years.

But if you feel 'done' then your done. That's my only advice.

Though I'd feel very sad to see this forum closing down.
There's no similar place in the web for me.

And though my spare time is a little bit limited I've often tried to share my (poor) knowledge with newcomers.

Perhaps reaching out for a greater amount of media attention. Game file research is controversial, in a way you are breaking into files which for a reason are encrypted, but controversy is also a great way to get heared. I think that many modding communities which are desperately trying to mod a game would greatly prosper from knowing better that this forum is out there. If you can, in example, have your forum connected to some breakthroughs in a game with a big title, say Grand Theft Auto or a difficult-to-mod MMORPG, the internet will not only flock to this forum, but you'll have a strong position for financing aid, reaching out to potential modders and even media coverage when need be.

Well, as for me, the simple answer is because I like it. I like digging in those hex numbers, decoding them, and then seeing the magic of putting audio, textures and models back changed and the game working totally different. Of course it can be boring if you just unpack archives, but even this is never the same, every other time it's something different. Also, this is really the thing that "the new blood" people could learn.

I understand your sentiment. Of course there are many times I think: "Oh I can do that. I could fire up OllyDbg to take a look at the executable, or Hex Workshop, to figure stuff out." and then don't because I just don't feel like it anymore, or just don't have the time. I did the YouTube things to teach others, and granted, I like doing it, because I have this compulse file format analysis disorder.  But I can't be bothered with creating another tool, just the time that it would take, I just say no.

Also, the removal of Noesis, for which Rich used to come here often enough to give people good advice.

Just to be clear, Rich himself offered to remove Noesis because of some issues we were having, but if anything, Rich is more than welcome to upload it back today. Those issues have been resolved. I just don't think Rich will put much effort in it. But that he needs to answer himself, I cannot speak for him. He is a mod here though.

As said, Rich is still here, Noesis is not hosted, that is all. As for Luigi, there was a different view on the way forward, but that does not mean I disrespect him or hold any grudge. He has done a great job on QuickBMS and all the scripts he writes is just amazing. He was never banned, and he still has his account here. I would welcome his return, but again, that is not up to me. 

But I agree that we may need some new management.

Guess I can post something from the POV of someone that mainly uses tools, gives thanks for tools I use, report issues with said tools and not much else. I do check the forums every day or so to see if anything new has popped up and have noticed a decline in new stuff although I assumed that the new consoles and figuring out how to extract from them played a role in the decline. 

Getting new people to work on tools, scripts, etc seems to be a bit of an issue. Seems the same handful of people (who do fantastic work btw) are the only ones putting out new stuff. There are obviously plenty of people out there that know about game extraction and modding but for whatever reason don't post here. Not sure if it's that they don't know about Xentax, just don't want to post here, or simply prefer to stick to forums dedicated to something specific to their interests (e.g. Facepunch or the Resident Evil modding forum). 

I wouldn't mind learning how to create tools and scripts but it would be a rather long process as I'd be starting from scratch. Hell, I've been fooling around with XNALara model conversions for a couple years now and still only kinda grasp how everything works, nevermind how the tools/scripts I use do what they do. On that same line of thought, I also don't want to post in threads where people are discussing extracting stuff from games as I don't really understand a lot of what they're saying. It can be intimidating and I'd rather just wait for the end result and say "thanks for the work". 

If hosting costs are an issue, put up a donation button and I'm sure you'll get folks chipping in to keep the lights on. I'm also okay with giving something more than "thank you" to the people that put in time and effort creating the tools I use although I understand there are issues with that. If you're losing the desire to run the place then I hope someone else is willing and able to take over. If not, nobody can fault you for moving on from something you're no longer passionate about. 

TL;DR that rambling nonsense: I'm not an active member around here as far as posting goes but I certainly appreciate the work that goes into the tools and scripts posted here and would hate to see Xentax go away.

I've only recently registered here since hearing that registrations were opened to the public, so my general opinion of the board hasn't quite formed fully as of yet. This being my first post (Hello!), I've had plans to make a few other topics and see about getting assistance with a few projects I've put on some other sites. However, it's mostly time constraints and other personal issues that have prevented me from doing so.

The community here all-around seems to be very friendly and inclusive upon first glance, so I'm hoping that I'll have a positive experience here. I'm probably really unaware of the complete happenings of this community, however, it seems that Xentax is a fairly useful site in many regards, considering the vast amount of people here and the talents they bring with them, so having such a powerful resource is great. It would definitely be a shame were it to disappear.

Yeah, I just removed Noesis to help with bandwidth. It wasn't a political thing. I still come here and check up on things once every week or six.

I've mostly lost interest in Noesis because the code is so unsalvageable, and because work is eating more and more of my soul these days. Granted, a lot of the people that use Noesis are awful, but it was never a project motivated by users or user feedback. I'll probably do something interesting next time I have some professional down time, that's usually when I gravitate back to it.

I'd like to start a movement here to leverage all of the talent in this community, and I randomly have ideas about what kinds of projects could be reasonably accomplished, but I consider myself useless in that regard for as long as my mind is devoted to slavery. I think having a life (whether that's a good thing or not) is usually the problem.

Oh, and as for the suggestions to go after more media attention, you should remember that this is a double edged sword. Getting too big can result in getting shut down very easily. Of course, the tendency we have to work "behind the scenes" leads to a lot of others stealing credit and glory and so on, but it's also allowed things to go about in a relatively C&D-free manner. If Xentax became the hub for modding some AAA game that the publisher doesn't want modded, especially given where the server is located, it would probably be a short-lived happiness.

I think there's probably a happy medium there, but it requires care to be taken by all involved in a given project.

Yes, I would be in favor of Rich's movement to start projects to leverage the talent here, similar to what we did in the past, but better. Examples include the modding of games to include Dutch politicians right before the elections, Noesis itself, QuickBMS, Ikskoks' tools ,EA Graphics Tools, Beyond: Two Souls port and what not (see the Tools Blog for other software examples [blog](http://forum.xentax.com/blog) ). And we haven't even begun to list all the user made tools there. 

It need to be projects people will support and be able to dedicate time to complete. Also, it would help if we had a place to see the results of efforts. If people just come in here for a quick fix and nobody sees the results of the analysis, it all seems bland and futile for those who helped out.  

Judging from the interim results of the poll questions (with a low show-up of around 200 voters so far, I must add, but still enough to get a rough glimpse of how the community feels) only 1 in 5 members visit here daily, and about 50% visit at least weekly. That's not that bad, I would say. Two thirds of our voters are 30 years or younger, with the majority of those in their late teens or early twenties, so there is young spirit as well. What is also obvious however is that 50% is here just to download tools and/or read information, but say they hardly post. And then 12% help out others mainly, while 14% is just here to get help. Finally a quarter of the voters say they both help others, as well as ask for help. Since 200 voters do not represent the total number of users, I do believe this number of 50% may be an underestimation. Nevertheless, it is what it is. The activity apparently comes from a smaller core of the community.

Things have to be innovated though, or improved at least. Such as the forum backbone (phpBB can go) and integrated CMS. Also, we should take heed of copyrights as we reach out to media, like Rich said, we can get shut down easily if we do stuff that will hurt.

That's because it's like science: the problem may be solved in a week, or you can waste all your life on it and never succeed.

one of the first posts here said this place is like an oasis in a desert. i could not agree more - the knowledgebase here is fantastic and some of the contributions and discussion here are really impressive. as a forum, this aspect of sharing needs more attention over complete releases, which as other posts mention are much harder to come by and a legal grey area.

i would love to see xentax as a hub for research engineering feats - regardless of their progress. unfortunately i feel some of theinformation isn't very accessable. the tools blog is a great idea, but the wiki feels unreliable - i would love to amend details on the wiki but put off on the stability of it.

i have limited knowledge of forum software, but i would like to see highlighted user content - either old forum posts (beyond port) or obsecure tools which could use some attention. maybe a news aggregate site like hacker news : news.ycombinator.com

 

i would be very sad to see it close after 26 years - but would be happy to help carve out its future !

To sustain the forum an actual management team should be in place. 

1. PR person should keep track of the things happening at the forum and reach out/be in contact with other communities to showcase our community
2. An internal journalist/newsposter should post on the Facebook page and some news page of the website about the latest cool findings/stuff to constantly make sure we have output/exposure
3. Preset projects should be found that are actually finished by teams
4. The forum should be updated both in code and layout, and managed by two dedicated admins, backed by a few moderators. 
Also, the forum should include a CMS to list tools and other important things to highlight, so this can be found easily by everyone out there (like I attempted to do with the Tools Blog, where every member has the right to post his or her tool, but in reality totally relied on just a few that did so, and me that posted most of the stuff). 
5. Contests/Awards could be designed to celebrate our members


The financial situation of the forum is not an issue. A dedicated management team to take it to the next level is what is lacking. That's the time constraint of the current management.

Always cynical as I am, I'd wager that anyone willing to take over in present state would do a terrible job. In order to get someone fully qualified and motivated to manage a community and/or forum like this, they need some significant ego-driven or finance-driven incentive. We have some regulars and some decent talent across a few different areas, but it's probably not enough to drive anyone at a goal for more than a week before they go back to being disenfranchised.

Now that I've shat all over things here, I should say that we'd probably not have a tough time finding people if we hit a few projects over popular gaming media sequentially. It's largely about persistent draw and not so much those one-off "LOOK AT THIS COOL HACK" stories that are so popular and leave their subjects in the dust after a week. Sequential popular projects on the other hand would be enough to draw in a big pool of permanent-ish community members, and lead to a surge in narcissists looking to help out in ways that don't require years of programming experience. And such narcissists are typically the reason for perceived popularity and success, as they comprise that very same gaming media. Then we could all masturbate all over ourselves happily ever after.

That's my sadly accurate take on it. Whether the joys of mild e-fame and masturbation are truly worth it in the end is up to the community as a whole. You gain some things and lose some things, and it has a tendency to push some of the base talent pool away while drawing others in.

To add to that, out of the thousands of registered members, most just come here to download this or that tool (one time), and then are on their merry way. See also the low number of votes in the polls, compared to the user base, not many people bothered to vote. Yet, there are still many people who think the knowledge base here is unprecedented and substantial. Be that as it may, and I do not doubt that Xentax has a unique thing going on, a community must uphold itself. It has been years since I have been truly the ego-driven maniac that ran this forum, did the PR, wrote tools etc etc, life just catches up on you as priorities shift. I still would hope to think that among the members, there are those who are young that can give the much needed fresh boost and/or approach, with energy and the right priority. Looking at the results of the poll so far, that should definitely be the case. 

Yet, perhaps the new adults of this era, are not as keen on this as we were at that age. 

The other suggestion I read is to just keep the forum up, and don't do a thing anymore. Led it run as-is, because a lot of people still need it, and it would not cost any time, just a little money. 
Of course, that could be done, and to be frank, is already the case for some time, as no substantial changes in terms of the website have been made, apart from the tools blog, and the Let's MultiEx series. We've also gone back to an open forum, and limited rules set. 

There IS a lot of talent here, and excellent people, that could do anything if they wanted to. That's where the defined projects could come in, something tangible to put your teeth in and gain fame and glory for all eternity (that's quite a long time, so w00t). 

There should be talented people in there as well to lead this forum, I would hope. If not, then after 12 years going strong (steady for years now), I doubt it can sustain itself without guidance.

To clean the population, we can do what we did years ago: purge the forum. We deleted all users that had 0 posts. Just to get the core community a bit more clear. We warned everyone in advance, with a number of reminders, to post at least once in a designated thread. So their post count would at least not be 0, and their account would not be deleted. They could just say:"HI" and it would be okay.

Hi. (kidding)

I have a hard time with the poll. I just got interested in this stuff a few months back and then have been way too busy to look at it again. I guess that means I am not statistically relevant. But, it doesn't mean I have a pattern of not coming here often, or a lack of interest, since there hasn't been enough time to judge either.

Why though? Is it my understanding that you're concerned the website has not attracted a sufficient community and thus you've decided it's the end? It does seem like there's an awful lot of people who always want help, but perhaps they don't have the knowledge to help themselves. The problem is that the ratio to users that can help is outbalanced significantly by those who can't and just want to request help. 

I personally haven't been here due to several reasons, life, other stuff users have mentioned. I just feel that Xentax has lost it's life? I got the impression that everyone got bored, didn't see much staff around etc? Just feels deserted like there's no lead/forum management. I'm bored of writing scripts/code to unpack/view models/archives/textures now. I learnt from one of the most experienced people on this forum and I'm thankful that this forum exists. It would be a huge shame to see this forum go, there's lots of talented people here. 

What I dislike though is the outdated layout of this forum (no offense), not many places to discuss specific categories/genres other than the "offtopic". Perhaps the forum could be like re-organised a little bit to give it more of a fresh look? I don't know, but I don't want to see the forum end like this.

Regards.

My work has occasionally required me to reverse-engineer products in order to modify them to fit the desired purpose.  This forum has been an excellent resource for learning various techniques and, of course, finding tools.  There are not many resources publically available for reversing game-related products, and being able to access this large repository of knowledge has definitely helped my career.

I realize that it's difficult to scrape together enough money to keep the servers running.  I am not a businessman, but I suspect that locking content behind a paywall would only serve to discourage people from joining the forum, and piracy would become a large problem. Unfortunately, it's either that, or throwing ads everywhere, or finding a sponsor.

If you do go the ad route, I suggest personally screening them for audio, malware, and popups.  Those are the #1 guaranteed way to lose viewers.

Good luck.

I would suggest affiliating with sites who's purpose is modding things but who also have a small number of users. A good example would be Metroid Construction and maybe hcs64. Granted, I have no idea what I'm talking about, but if xentax could be a site that brings all these other nodding communities together, then I think that would introduce a lot of new blood, and could be very helpful. By the way, is it illegal to reverse engineer this stuff or something?

Edit: What was Noesis? People are talking about it like it was legendary.

I like this forum, if nothing else it's a great read, my suggestions would be some sort of advertising to get in fresh blood, talking to/ incorporating other communities into the base forum, stuff like daggerfall tools could bring in a pool of new people that can then spread to non df-tools parts and create a feedback effect. of course DF tools already has a community, and xentax charges for membership so my next idea would be bounties and the like, unfortunately I have no money for any of that stuff. sorry I'm not very helpful

I will be interested, I already have my own forum (young forum, started in April 2015), using PHPbb too (but we are switching to a new board soon, a new board created from scratch, phpbb have too many flaw). Gravitrek Discovery

......

Off course, I'm not a native english speaker, sorry if I did some grammar/vocabulary mistake.

1. Hey Zaykho, I remember you, we were both Doax maniacs! 

2. A lot of people grab tools/models and then they disappear. This is due to the legality around reverse engineering....

I made a fully functional Doax-like game thanks to the help of the people on the forums, Noesis and all that good stuff!
However their is that fear which with good practice can prevent trouble  brewing such as no Nude releases etc.

As all of you know their is a lot of talent here, so much talent that if we combine it we can achieve anything....

I always wondered if their are people here this much talent we could make a Imagination recording machine if we really wanted!

3. Forum cost aside from donation, I wouldn't object to ads but again if we combined our efforts we could make medium sized video games or tools or whatever and some of the proceeds could go to keep the site running. Point is we have talent and theirs nothing to do with it. Theirs also the "maybe this provider is ripping us off thing, maybe its time to look at others".

4. I found this forum because I had a passion for seeking it out, and I helped others where I could also.
I agree on the purging users who don't post....I also want to mention I would not have known about this post had I not been given an email from the admins, I actually like getting emails from admins here as I can't be expected to browse the whole forum by myself and just find magic....theirs a lot of posts here so organizing it further can help....

5. I believe we shouldn't be worried about reaching out, if we reach out we will probably find more people who just want to take but not give and aren't passionate, just trust that the right people will come if we make the right changes here.

I mainly come here for reading material when TCRF gets stale. It's great to see what people can find out about old games. I'm a lurker by nature so I don't often post but I might start posting more now.
Also, use something like Google Forms for polls next time... 5 threads for 5 questions is a little clunky

I don't think I can add anything that hasn't already been mentioned.
I think this is the second most interesting forum for me. I will admit that I came here initially to leech downloads, but I stayed to mainly lurk. Which... Isn't much better. But I lack intelligence to commit much else, haha.

I'm a game developer myself, and I'm always curious of game internals and it's a joy to see other developers' wonderful artworks.
It used to be very difficult for me to reverse a unknown binary format without a debugger util I found this site, I learnt a lot here. Although this forum is not very active, the old posts here forms a very huge and valuable database. Those who are good at learning will sure be benifit from this site.

It is really very lucky that we have a forum dedicated to game resource file reverse engineering. Hope this site will go on.

IMPORTANT:

  I just want to state something here: this forum is far from dead, nor is it declining. Instead, stats show increasing activity the past period. Sure, the years 2011 and 2012 were strong, and the donations requirement did limit the activity somewhat. But today with the free registrations, we are at the same level of new user registrations each month (about 700), just like in those years, and the number of posts and topics do not decline at all the past three years. I expect them to increase further as we move ahead. So there is a good future for the forum. I was talking about a new management in place, younger team, to further launch into the future.

Yeah, it's an interesting culture where you have some guy playing games and making funny voices on YouTube getting 60 million views per video, and a few thousand for someone that is showing something useful or showcasing some feature that someone put dozens of hours into. I think it encourages people to go after the shallow side of perceived fame that they don't really have to work for.

This is probably how it will continue. Trying to focus all of the talent on this forum would be like herding cats too, it's unlikely we'll ever realize our full potential on a concentrated set of projects at once. Even if only due to people like me that can only spare the time and effort for short periods, and when they do they want it to be on things they really want to be working on. But I'm also too old to care about the fame side of it anymore, as it wears off after a few million-downloads projects, so I don't go after projects that will obviously be popular. It seems that a lot of the more talented members of this community and others that I've met have similar leanings, whether they don't give a shit anymore or they never did, there's always a lot of people putting a lot of time and unique skill into these obscure projects that they value more than most other people ever will. Something about that is admirable, even if it doesn't lead to Kotaku coverage and the devout support of the terrible gaming press.

I think it becomes clear with a certain measure of success that it's all fleeting. Millions of people were downloading my Half-Life AI project 15 years ago as it got regular media coverage and showed up on every PC magazine CD on the planet at some point, and now no one knows what it is. I made a viral music video when I was 16 before YouTube even existed, it survived through FTP, made its way through peer to peer networks, and later made it to YouTube, where there are a bunch of instances of it being uploaded and [some of those even have over half a million views all alone](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qr9ElWhJD4). I made another viral video a few years back slapping Ivy's titties around with mocap, it was good for LOLclickbait and so it exploded, but it provided no substance and got none in return. In the end, if you add all of this crap together, a lot of people know who I am while having no idea who I am. This makes me wonder just how many other people like me are out there contributing quietly to this giant cultural melting pot of software and media crap, eventually coming to the shared conclusion that it's not really worth bothering and refocusing that effort.

I think all of that is to say, who gives a shit? Just make some shit, and find meaning in your own shit. Maybe share it with others after you spend a lot of time on your shit and others start to like the smell of it. I think when it comes to making some shit and not giving too much of a shit about the shit, Xentax is a pretty good outlet, and I like that.

I think following passion is the best principle. I am sure at the time that Half Life mod was significant, and I know their are people who still remember it especially those of who it truly affected. Its been a long time since then though and today's world has different needs. 

My goal is to make video games such as classic Role Playing Games because they allow me to use a fantasy environment and teach a really nice story that makes the player feel their time is being used well, perhaps regardless of the product it inspires people in some way....

You may never know how deeply you affected some people with whatever you have done, but you have.

Having said that it is also wise to ask yourself honestly as to the reasons you do the things you do.

In any case it doesn't matter how old you are, the wiser the better! 

And you can use all the experience you have to make something that others enjoy but that you also enjoy, it really doesn't matter what it is, and you never know, this joy could lead to being able to support you in more ways than one such as financial....

If you were the guy in this video that did this which judging by your name you did and also created the Noesis Plugin:
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNAXVs8rydU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNAXVs8rydU)

Then you my man are a legend, the stuff you were able to do definitely influenced my life without a doubt and inspired me to go the distance!

I guess one day the younger generation will be in your shoes helping those who need it.
If you do not feel a sense of accomplishment like what you have done mattered then I think you need to ask yourself and trace back to those beliefs causing you to believe them and clear them because they are nonsense!

I do think the individual experience is what matters there. I got an e-mail a month or two ago from someone who told me my old modding work had played a big part in shaping his life and career path, telling my of his trials and successes and ultimately thanking me. That kind of thing is very rewarding. So I don't think everything I've done is pointless, but I do think I could've achieved a similar meaningful impact with as many individuals without appealing to the masses.

It's true that touching a wide audience will inspire that many more people, but I think the real problem, and the reason I'm so jaded with the media, is that I've witnessed the trend over the years of popular media getting more and more mindless and stimulus-based. This is probably the perspective of every old man in every cultural generation. Perhaps it's not as much culture changing as it is the old man understanding the culture, or more likely it's a bit of both.

So, that's what leads back to the "who gives a shit, just make some shit" point. Xentax doesn't necessarily need fame to have good meaning, and people will come as they come. As will the quiet leeches that seek to fulfill their anime fetishes in the shadows, and the sad men that take something someone has done here back to their own community to use as another badge for their own localized hero worship. In the end, people are inspiring and awful, so, you end up taking the good with the bad no matter how big or how small.

- Post Title: Re: The future of the forum: Ideas, suggestions and general.

I remember a few (tear-) jerking moments myself, such as forcing the devs of Painkiller to switch to yet another encryption method in a patch after I had figured out their retail encryption method and posted it on their (and our) forum, or the moment I realized MultiEx Commander had been cracked by warez dudes (see example below). After all, you're finally taken seriously if haxx0rz develop cracks/keygens/serials, right? I even got into a bitch fight with one of them right here on this forum.   These script kiddies were so fond of themselves. Ah, those were the days. Writing the Definitive Guide to Exploring File Formats with Watto was also good fun, as was setting up this god damn WIKI with both Watto and Elbereth. PT Explorer was also great fun to do and help those guys out. [viewtopic.php?f=18&t=3834&hilit=raw+2010+ptexplorer](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=18&t=3834&hilit=raw+2010+ptexplorer) Going through the threads, there are ample more good moments. . .
It was good to race the other guys sometimes to see who could figure stuff out first. 
But things move on. So you "youngsters": step up. Lead the board.
