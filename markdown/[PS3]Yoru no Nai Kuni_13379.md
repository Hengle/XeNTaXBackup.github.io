I see the face is missing.
I guess the face is in the g1h file, which contains multiple G1M_0036 block。

The vertex buffer in the xxx_default.g1m file may contain different number of morph shapes, the default one, and other placeholders, which will be loaded into memory at runtime from the g1h file.
