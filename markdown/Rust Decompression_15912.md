- Post Title: Rust Decompression

I have a compressed Unity 5.4.0p1 ".bundle" file containing audio files from the game Rust (sound.bundle). I've exhausted other means of decompressing this such as Unity Assets Bundle Extractor v2.1c with no success. Is there any known method to get the audio from 5.4.0p1 unity?
