London 2012 just came out and i was trying to edit some functions 
the game uses .pkz files only, (some others like .fsb ; .texture & .usm for video)
I don't understand nothing about Compressed methods, can anyone help or look into this files ?

back when the ps3 version was released, i looked at the pkz files and they were not compressed.

no. sports games with lots of models of fit guys don't get a lot of love around here he he he. now that you know that they are uncompressed (archery_str_en.pkz contains some localization info and no models), it is best to post in the appropriate forum (localization, or archive research, 2D/3D models, etc.). i was planning on hardcoding the swimmers and the gymnasts out of there when i have some time but that's about it.
