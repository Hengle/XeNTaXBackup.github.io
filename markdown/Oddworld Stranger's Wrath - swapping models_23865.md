- Post Title: Oddworld: Stranger's Wrath - swapping models

been rippin Oddworld strangers wrath apart trying to do some experimenting with modding. I havent seen any mods for this game before so I wasnt to sure how to approach it. If I were to explain my end goal simply it would be to swap the strangers model in the first half of the game with sektos in game model. I found tools on this website (yes as in this very one) to decrypt the smb files for the game containing the model information textures rigs animations ect. With that said yes I know where Sekto's smb is, he is npc_11.smb in the Im_region_06 folder. The model for the stranger seems to be located in globals as globals_stranger.smb, with that said if it comes to it and the bones dont cooperate on a streamlined basis like it does for games like fable tlc's ect then YES I am prepared to do some re-rigging if I must but this would require reverse engineering of the smb decrypter a way to "put it back together" sorta speak. Is there anyone who would be willing to help me? Even just more information about the smb's help any time ive tried touching them or hex editting them i get an infinite loading screen. Touching the sbl's appears to do nothing in the globals folder and I dont quite understand, anything helps any bit of knowledge and thank you in advance.
