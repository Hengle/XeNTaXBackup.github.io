- Post Title: Bram Stokers Dracula (PC DOS) .BIN & .EXE files?

I need help with the BIN format from the PC DOS version of "Bram Stoker's Dracula", i have been able to determine
what they contain from swapping the game files around, i also suspect that there are files stored inside the actual executable file
of the game. Could someone please take a look at the files?, i cant seem to find any program that will extract them.
