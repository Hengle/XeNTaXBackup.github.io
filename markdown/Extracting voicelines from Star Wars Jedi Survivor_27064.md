- Post Title: Extracting voicelines from Star Wars Jedi Survivor

Hello there !

I am currently creating French audio mods for Star Wars Battlefront 2 and I would like to use some voicelines from Star Wars Jedi Survivor. One year ago, I managed to do this with Jedi Fallen Order (there was 22000 files not sorted   ) , but I don't remember how I did it   .

Does someone know which file has to be used and how to extract its content (for example with a bms script)?

By the way, if someone wants some French audio files from Star Wars games, feel free to ask.

Thanks in advance for your help.
