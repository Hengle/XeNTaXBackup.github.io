- Post Title: Company of Heroes Animations

To be honest i'm not sure whether the source of my problem is the importer importing the wrong animation, or me assigning the animation incorrectly.
I'm having some problems importing the animations using RGM Importer 0.25 into 3DSMax for Company of Heroes.
The animations are very... wrong.

Lol it looks like he has boneitis.

What will get the animations to play correctly?
Any other assistance would be greatly appreciated.

This is where the 0.25 importer is.

I made a similar topic about this in Game Specific Tools.
