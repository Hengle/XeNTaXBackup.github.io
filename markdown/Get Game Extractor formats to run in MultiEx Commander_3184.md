Game Extractor is a program by Watto that is similar to MultiEx Commander.

Zench has done excellent work and made it possible to use the plugins that GE uses to process archives.

Now you can easily add those to MultiEx Commander's arsenal of supported formats!

Read all about it here:

Thumbs up for Zench!

hiya, kinda new here.. but here goes nothin

i downloaded multiex and im getting an error... "unable to find game extractor's jar file."
like if the program needs this jar file, then why isn't it included with the program :s

is there a good noob friendly "getting started guide" for multiex and or this hex workshop? assuming i even need any of these..

why would you want to extract a simple .zip, .rar, .pk3/4 or w/e with multiex or look at a typical archive with a hex editor when its easily extractable with freely available software?

im looking to extract some files from street fighter 4 xbox version. They are .emb's (which are obviously textures etc..) .emz's (of which i have no clue what they are, but probably animation files etc..) and .cbs (which are obviously sound files). So anyways I'm just a bit lost in the clouds here, and there's usually a simple awnser... if explained properly! So I'm just lookin for some info to get me started.. void of overdone technical mumbojumbo!

Sure i could search faq's or search google on how to make an automatic machine gun out of toilet paper until my eye's fall out, but that would be somewhat inefficient.. if you get what i mean. I know there's lots of people who hold on to their precious knowledge that was so hard for them to grasp and end up flaming noobs to avoid a straight awnser, and that's not what im looking for. So all flaming aside, if ya have a general idea of what im trying to ask.. maybe you'll take the time to give an appropriate awnser, if you have no awnser and would like to resort to flaming then don't bother. 

Sry if this is in the wrong thread, but any help is appreciated!
