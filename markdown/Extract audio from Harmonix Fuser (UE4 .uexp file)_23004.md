- Post Title: Extract audio from Harmonix Fuser (UE4 .uexp file)

I've seen some people do magic with separating out baked content in a .uexp file and was wondering if anyone could help. Opening up the .uexp, you can see there's a mogg audio file (don't worry if this doesn't play by default, it may be encrypted and I have a decypter for HMX Mogg files) and a .fusion file that's in plain text in the .uexp file (which seems to indicate the .uexp isn't compressed).

Thanks so much for your help! Here's a sample of one of the audio files

is there anyway that the decrypter would work on mogg files for Dance Central VR? me and some others in a DC discord cannot find a way currently to decrypt DCVR's.
