Hello everyone, can you help me for make Export & Import tools for this game. I want to Translating to my local language. But, I found the files only Uexp & Uasset files. Not LOCRES!!

This game used UE4 v.4.26 (Tested with UModel)

You can download the Example files:

Anyone know how to extract the models/textures/sounds from the game? Umodel isn't working at all for me. When I try to open the game with it, All I get is this:
