- Post Title: Help to view graphics PS2

Hi guys, I've seen  a python file to the Noesis tool that reads the pallete data and the texture information for a ps2 game road trip.

This opens nicely the 06.GSL file however the other files with the same structure can't open/are not completely correct. What do I need to change besides the initial sign of 0x1012,0x1040 or 0x1087? Thank you

This is the link with 3 texture sample of the game and the .py to place under noesis plugins

Loading ...05.GSL as raw data into IrfanView (at the left) or try Noesis (at the right side), data offset used: 112 bytes:

(You need to care for the palette, of course.)
