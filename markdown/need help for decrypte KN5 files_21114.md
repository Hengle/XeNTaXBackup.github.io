2.rename rename kn5conv_x64exe to kn5conv.exe to use with any batch type of converters that use kn5conv

i dont know much about decryption or how the encryption works, (which i will explain why later)

but basically the assetto corsa modders were tired of us taking the models from their mods so they installed an encryptor to their mods which will make it look okay in game, but look deformed and messed up when exported;; etc.

the tool isnt available to the general public, and you have to ask x4fab's permission (or make him do it) to encrypt your own mods. thats why theres no knowledge on how this works or where we can find the encryptor file. just letting you guys know
