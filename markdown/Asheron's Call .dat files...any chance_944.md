- Post Title: Asheron's Call .dat files...any chance?

I've been looking into every .dat opener, extracter, viewer every made...and I can't seem to get into Microsoft's Asheron Call .dat files!
It's a fairly old game, around 4-5 years...so I'm sure it would be fairly easy to get into....any help would be greatly appreciated.
Support with Xentax would just make it 200x easier! haha thanks guy!

Will look into it. We are still in the process of renewing the plugin system for MultiEx Commander, but perhaps I can do it using standard MultiEx script.
