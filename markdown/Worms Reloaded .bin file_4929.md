Your tool gets the text in ASCII
But the text of the game is encoded in the UTF-8
The English alphabet is displayed correctly, but all other characters are displayed in a format like this:
{ByteHexCode}{ByteHexCode}{ByteHexCode}.
I have to pre-encode my text in this format.
This is very inconvenient. Could you fix the program?
But Thank You anyway.

No problem dude, just translate the texts in the windows notepad. the tool converts the txt to the game format when you click insert.

No.
Firstly, Notepad does not not display characters like '
Showing instead that something like this {code}.
And secondly tool are crashes during conversion with error.

Hi guys,
Did you notice, that rebuilded .bin file (nonmodified .txt)  is bigger than original .bin? 
Ex. AllTextEng.bin = 107 517B, new-AllTextEng.bin = 108 249B

And also game runs with new .bin, but weapon's damages are bad. From 1 to 3 points only. Weird

Its because this tool was created for the psp version. wich uses the same file structures but its bigger.

OK, size isn't big problem, but what about that damage? 
Can game has some modification protection or something?

Yes, unfortunately changing files in Worms Reloaded causes low damage. (Security measure)

I think its kinda stupid if is anti-cheat feature, coz editing language file
has nothing to do with cheating
they using maybe some crc checksum protection for checking if file is original:-/

The game use CRC32 to check every file. So if you modify some file, you must also modify the CRC32 Checksum in the exe file.
Here is how to do it in Noob way:
Origin Checksum: use winrar to compress the origin file you want to modify. Then in "CRC32" column, you'll see the Checksum. copy it down.
Use the same way to get the checksum for your new file.

Now use Hex edit tool(hexshop,ultraedit, anything you like)open wormreloaded.exe, search for hex value of Origin Checksum. Remember,the byte order should be reversed. If the checksum is 0x12345678, then search for 78 56 34 12.
Why? Go wiki for"endian".
Usually you'll find this four bytes only once. If so, it's where the checksum is. Recored the address. If it happens two or three times, just try to mod the value.Then put your checksum in this place.Remember to reverse it. Also, the address would be invalid after each update. you'll need to do it all over again for new update.

Name title and the text title.

```
Com.TeamWin.11 = %TeamName% chalks up a victory!
```


Encoded in the UTF-8.

```
Com.TeamDeath.9 = That’s that for %TeamName%!

The address email for a new update program. Yes!

The game uses crc32 checking. So here's a tricky solution:

1: Choose you file, for example: AllTextEng.bin
1: Make a backup copy of the original file (for example: AllTextEng.bin.original)
2: Translate the file as you wish (for example with the caws tool)
3: Correct the translated file with my program, using the original file as a reference value,
   for example: crc32trick.exe AllTextEng.bin AllTextEng.bin.original
   (This is a commandline program, no graphical interface.)   [http://www.sendspace.com/file/e624nh](http://www.sendspace.com/file/e624nh)
