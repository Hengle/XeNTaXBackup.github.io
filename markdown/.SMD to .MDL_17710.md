- Post Title: .SMD to .MDL

I can not convert .smd file in .mdl for the SFM. I have a .smd file, I'm trying to shove it into .mdl via the Crowbar. But the program gives an error. Although I created a .qc file.

Crowbar ERROR:

```
  Possible causes: The game's SDK or Authoring Tools has not been installed (usually via Steam Library Tools) or the path given to Crowbar (via Set Up Games button) is incorrect.
Crowbar ERROR: The game's "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\SourceFilmmaker\game\usermod\gameinfo.txt" file does not exist.
  Possible causes: The game's SDK or Authoring Tools has not been installed (usually via Steam Library Tools) or the path given to Crowbar (via Set Up Games button) is incorrect.
