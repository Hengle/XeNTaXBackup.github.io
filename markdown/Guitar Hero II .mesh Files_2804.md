- Post Title: Guitar Hero II .mesh Files

I registered ONLY for you guys to crack a couple of formats or help me do it. Now, if anyone has "Guitar Hero II" download "Ghex" open your Archive, go to Char-->Og-->guitars--> guitar_sg.milo_ps2 and extract guitar1.mesh. I was wanting to know if anyone could convert them to something like .3ds, edit them, convert and then put them back in. Just try to please.
Can't post the file.

Why lock this? Did you or anyone else figure out how to do this? I am extremely interested in editing the mesh files.

Please let me know if there is a program that can open and edit them.

Thanks

P.S., sorry for resurrecting a months-old topic. I just really want to figure out a way to edit these files. I want to be able to smash heads down to nothing to practically remove them, change the outline of guitars, and remove or modify other body parts. If anyone here can help me figure out a way to edit these files, or to convert the files so that they can be used in a program like 3dsMax, that would be wonderful!

Let me know if you would need any other info about the files, etc. I can also be reached at hockey2112 -a-t- gmail -d-o-t- com . Thanks!


EDIT
