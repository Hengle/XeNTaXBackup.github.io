- Post Title: XeNTaX TRE Archiver 1.0.3

I seem to be having problems extracting from certain TREs. I am a friend of MultiEx and have registered MultiEx Commander.

Here's the problem:

Start XeNTaX' TRE Archiver 1.0.3
Load sku0_client.toc
Select patch_23_client_00.tre
Start Extract All.
Run-time Error '9'; Subscript out of range.
Program Closes.

Any help on resolving this issue would be great. It seems to be from specific files. Most TREs work but a few don't. The error seems to occur with some TREs that are not opened with a TOC and some that are with a TOC with no apparent patterns. I have fully analyzed the TREs with the Login Update and with the TREFix Utility. The other files with this error were able to be bypassed, but this one can not because it can only be opened by a TOC. Thank you very much in advance.
