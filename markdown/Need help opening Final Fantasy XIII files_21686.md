- Post Title: Need help opening Final Fantasy XIII files

I have the .trb and .imgb files for the models of the game, but I cannot open them. I've been trying to use Noesis (did this years ago and used it then, but long forgotten most of it) and it can't open FF13/13-2 files, it's not under associations.

Can anyone let me know how to get Noesis to open these, or point me to another model viewer that can open them?
