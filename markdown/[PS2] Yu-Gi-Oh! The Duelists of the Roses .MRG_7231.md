- Post Title: [PS2] Yu-Gi-Oh! The Duelists of the Roses *.MRG

This request may not be very straightforward; there are 15 *.MRG files in the /data directory for this game, and looking over a few of them with XVI32, it doesn't look like there's a single overarching format at work here. Nevertheless, I'm mostly interested in getting images from them, and to that end, I've uploaded the three most promising-looking files, PICMINI.MRG, PICPAC.MRG, and PICTURES.MRG, at [http://www.gamefront.com/files/20711123/DATA.7z](http://www.gamefront.com/files/20711123/DATA.7z) (I did so as a guest, so it'll be deleted after a week of inactivity... just a heads-up, in the event I need to reupload it).

I guess no one's interested in looking at this. =D The download link's expired by now; if someone does want to have a look, let me know and I'll reupload the files.
