Hello all. 

The new installment of MultiEx Commander has some new system files that are newer versions than those supported by Win98 (and probably Win NT). This means that on these operating systems the setup program will ask you to overwrite the system files. If you do this, your windows can't handle the new system files. It will result in a boot error of Windows98 and you will need to replace the installed newer files with your old ones. If you still want to install it on your computer running the older OS (Win98/NT) first make sure you backup the system files (you will see which when you try to install the program), so you can replace the new ones again after install. This however may take some knowledge of your system, and is not recommended. 

Thanks to Anton Klink and ric for pointing this out and sorry that it won't run on your systems.

Hello, just curious why you can't put those files in the same directory as the app instead of the system directory. wouldn't that work? I use win98 but havent tried this neat little app yet.. Alot of ppl use win98 so it would be nice if there was some kind of win98-safe installation..

Well, you could try. Just open the cab file and place the files where you want them. Read the .lst file where the files should be placed. Also, if you have the previous version, a simple install from within the old program would also work.
