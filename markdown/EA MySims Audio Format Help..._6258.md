- Post Title: EA MySims Audio Format Help...

Hi, I'm new here, and I came to ask for help on a certain Electronic Arts audio format that is included in both the PC and Wii version of MySims. One person has already began to get the audio, but he's not willing to help me out. The audio comes in .strm format; it is not a Nintendo DS file, or an Xbox file, as far as I know. If I use a program such as Nova Extractor, I get a .MUS file, which is apparently a Sims PS2 audio file. If I import the files into a program such as Audacity, it imports fine, but the problem is, the frequency is too high, and there are distinct interferences every quarter of a second. People have come to say the files are 'broken', but I want to fix it. I can change the frequency, but no matter what I do, the clicks/pops will not come out of the audio. I have researched headers for the file, and I think i've deducted the 'kind' of file it is. But do the the fact no one has come across this kind of file with the given problems, there are no programs to convert it or anything. Even if I do, with say, a plugin in Winamp, the clicks/pops are still there.

I could upload a sample of the file if someone is willing to help; It's a soundtrack I've wanted for a while, and I'd share it with you, if you wanted it.

Thanks..

Upload one of the extracted .strm files.

Are these files coming from the Wii version or the PC version?

I might sound stupid, but how can I upload? .Strm file is not supported, and even when compressed the file is too large. Oh... and the files are extracted from the PC version of the game.

Archive the .strm file into a .rar or .zip file and then upload it to a file hosting site like Mediafire.

I managed to figure it out, a converter I used a few years back was able to convert the files perfectly, in crystal clear format. Thanks for trying to help me out, though.  Now I have another audio problem with a different file, haha, but I'll create a different thread for it, as it's totally different.

Thanks
