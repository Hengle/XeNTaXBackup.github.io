Models are mdx2 format, same as [tianji online](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=2839) (guess I'll write a noesis plugin for that now)

It is a typical chunk-based format

```
int32 chunkSize

```


EDIT:

Turns out a lot of the texPaths contain chinese characters. Parser has a huge ugly function for splitting up file paths atm

mdx2 importer WIP

Really ugly texture filename parsing, but it should get the job done.
Not sure if textures are assigned to the correct materials.

Each chunk can be filled in separately.
