- Post Title: *.PSP files

Hi there  
I'm here because I have issues with *.PSP files, hence the name of the topic, I'm trying to rip graphics from the game 'From Russia with Love" on PSP, I found this topic about the same file format : [viewtopic.php?f=10&t=12081](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=12081)
So I tried to open the files with Asura Engine Extractor, and it worked, but the problem is, they're full of *.PNG, *.BMP and *.TGA files that can't be opened while they seem to be common image files.
Now if someone could tell what's wrong in what I've done, it would be nice, thanks in advance!

I had the same problem with the PSP Star Wars Battlefront games. TGA/PNG files can't be opened for some reason. However, you can still extract the textures by running PPSSPP with Texmod. They usually come out in BGR format (IIRC), but it's easy to convert it back to RGB.

Unfortunately this emulator doesn't run on my PC, that's why I'm trying to rip this game's graphics in the iso itself
