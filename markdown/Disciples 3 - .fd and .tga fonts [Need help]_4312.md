- Post Title: Disciples 3 - .fd and .tga fonts [Need help]

Hi,

Does anybody know, how can I edit/repack these files? Or maybe the .fd file is unnecessary for editing the font?

Here is one of them:
[URWAlcuinTCY_24.fd - 0.01MB](http://www.zshare.net/download/74772166aa5d9f14/)

And the .TGA file for it as well:
[URWAlcuinTCY_24.tga - 0.50MB](http://www.zshare.net/download/7477219580923ee7/)

I want to edit the font file, because for the translation I have to add some new characters to it, to be properly viewed in the game (or else it is just weird letters).
