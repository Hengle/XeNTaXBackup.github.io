- Post Title: WWE 13 (Xbox 360) new pac file format?

It seems this year something has been changed in the  WWE 13 (Xbox 360) file format of the .pac files, extracting the textures using traditional means: X-Packer or Quick BMS will no longer seem to work, they also have changed the bik video files to bik2 format (KB2 container) new codec?.

Not sure how I should request help on this, other than just asking and not attaching or linking to anything, but any help is appreciated.
