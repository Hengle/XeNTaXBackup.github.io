- Post Title: Dragon Ball Tenkaichi 3 [PS2] Extracting models help

]OK so essentially what i have been trying to do is create my own mod for tenkaichi 3, just like the ones here [http://www.dragonballzmods.com/](http://www.dragonballzmods.com/)
I have been trying to extract the character models from Dragon Ball Z Budokai Tenkaichi 3 for a while now but I just can't find
any good tutorials. I hope that I can at least understand how to extract the files so that I may later reimport a modded version of the files. 

I do have a good lead and I know where the models are stored within the game. (data\PZS3US1.afs)... However most of the files have a .unk extension, which makes it difficult to extract the contents. I recently have come across the program quickbms, and I am trying to use a script made for budokai 3, not tenkaichi 3, but it does not seem to be working. The error doesn't seem to be in the script but way im using the program (im a newbie). After the third step (selecting the export folder) Im greeted with a fourth step. And it says "you must choose the name of the other file to load in the same folder"

Which makes no goddamn sense so I just type in a folder name and click open. But then I am left with "error permission denied." in the cmd prompt.

What im asking is several things: 
1. How do I solve the permission denied problem?
2. Is there a script for Tenkaichi 3?
3. How do Export models and textures from the .unk files?
4. How do reimport models and textures back to the .unk file format?
