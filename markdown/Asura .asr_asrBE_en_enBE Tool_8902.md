- Post Title: Asura .asr\asrBE\en\enBE Tool

This tool can handle the Asura Engine ASR files. Except compressed format!

Usage
Unpack: Drag&Drop an .asr file onto AsuraASR.exe or use command line: AsuraASR.exe xy.asr/asrBE/en/enBE.
Repack: Drag&Drop an .asr file or az unpacked folder onto AsuraASR.exe or use command line: AsuraASR.exe xy.asr/asrBE/en/enBE or AsuraASR.exe UnpackFolder
You can freely rename the exe!

The tool unpack the content of asr file, if not exist the output folder, which created by this tool. The unpacked files has no real name, but has extension!
The tool can create new asr file if you drag&drop a file (ONLY IF the unpacked folder exist) or even a folder onto the tool. The name or extension of files inside the given folder doesn't matter! The tool will read and use them in alphabetic order.

v0.1.0 - Unpack content of ASR file into folder, PC/Console supported
v0.2.1 - Repack function, unpacked files have extension

Lol will this work on Sniper Elite V2? Oh, and when I unpack some stuff from the game, I often end up with .RSCF files rather than textures that I get with the Asura Extractor.

Well, I wanted to mod and edit some textures in that game. And I do hope someone would come up with a model extraction/import tool, too.

Just rename it. If you created the asr file from console files, the new asr is also console verison, like asrbe.

Does this tool support the .asr file format from Evil Genius 2?

Tried drag and dropping an .asr file and got this

```
Evin 2018.07.10.
Unsupported Asura Engine ASR file format!
```


Looking for tools and ways to help me understand the inner workings of the game mechanics such as items and attributes and your tool was the only thing I found so far that could work with asr.

See the error message: access denied to the path. Copy everything to a simple and new folder, like C:\ASRwork and run from there.
Maybe there is a file name "English" without extension under folder Download. Delete or rename it.
