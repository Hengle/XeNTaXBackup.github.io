- Post Title: Witcher 3 redcloth?

Has anyone ever figured out the .redcloth files from Witcher 3?  I know they're apex cloth files, but I can't find any tools or information beyond that.

Kind of a necrothread, but if you see this, join the Glitcher 3 Modding Community server. It's still quite experimental, but people're getting results.
