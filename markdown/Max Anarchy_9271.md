Noesis already supports the models but the textures it's extracting is really low res.
There's a folder called HTextures which I believe the high res textures are, they are .wtb files.
I have used Bayonetta tools and can get them converted to .xpr but when I try to extract the textures from it with unbundler it just crashes.
chrrox XPR script for noesis gives an error too. 
Maybe the output XPR from Bayonetta tools isn't right or something.
Here's some screens of the files and error.



I can provide samples, just ask.
Thanks.

lol just use this tool for now... one of the xpr files generated from his tool crashes though. based on the output of his tool i'll whip up a batch processor in a bit.

I had tested that tool on my other but it didn't work under win xp :\ it's working now under win7 that's strange, it's usually the other way around.

Hmm. The character textures are inside the .dtt files which contains .wtb. HTextures folder contains props textures.

Thanks howfie, I wasn't going to try that again if you hadn't pointed it out

how would one go about extracting the dtt files for 360 version?
