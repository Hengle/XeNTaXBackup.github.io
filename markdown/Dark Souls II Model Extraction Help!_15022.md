- Post Title: Dark Souls II Model Extraction Help!

Hey guys! I'm really new to the scene, but I got Binder Tool to work! But I'm getting errors opening a lot of the FLVER files in Noesis, any ideas? I have the FLVER plugin and half the files DO work but most don't.

Just getting this! < [https://embed.gyazo.com/e727641a44be20e ... 7d8f7b.png](https://embed.gyazo.com/e727641a44be20efba4f9c9d2b7d8f7b.png)
Ideally I'm trying to find Old Iron King from DS2, any ideas where/how, what filename he is? Does anyone perhaps have him or could get me the file? I've been going through files for ages now getting errors, but some work, some don't! I think i'm going crazy!!

Cheers!
