Can somebody make an in-depth tutorial about QuickBMS? Every tutorial I've found so far is either broken or doesn't have enough info. Sorry if this is the wrong place

Can somebody make an in-depth tutorial about QuickBMS? Every tutorial I've found so far is either broken or doesn't have enough info.Well, I didn't even know that there are tutorials on it.
Most info I have is from quickbms.txt which comes with quickbms.

There's 100 s of bms scripts. Once I've a problem I search for a suiting one in xentax' threads (or zenhax) which comes next and modify it.
That's the way it goes.

If there's an unknown compression just inform Aluigi (on Zenhax) - usually he will take care of it. (Seems, he's a cool gui, just to have mentioned this here.  )
