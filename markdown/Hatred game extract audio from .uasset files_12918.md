- Post Title: Hatred game extract audio from .uasset files?

I've decided to try and extract audio from Hatred, and while using the tool I found [here](http://zenhax.com/viewtopic.php?t=1005) tool worked well in extracting all of the files from the base .pak file, I've not been able to find out anything except very vague info about the .uasset files that the majority of the game's files are in. It doesn't help that I'm a massive noob when it comes to practically anything like this. Does anyone have any tips? I've attached a rar that contains a few of what I assume are audio files in case that helps.
Cheers.

Just use OGG scanner tool to get audio.

Thanks, I used [this](http://murkymind.de/) one and it seems to work well, but is there anyway to use it to convert all files in a folder at the same time rather than one by one?
