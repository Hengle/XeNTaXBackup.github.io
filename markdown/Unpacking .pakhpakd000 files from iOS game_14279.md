- Post Title: Unpacking .pakh/pakd000 files from iOS game

I have an ios game and by extracting the .ipa file, i see that most of the data seems to be in:
core.pakh
core.pakd000
common.pakh
common.pakd000

how do i unpack these? HxD shows that the first 4 bytes of the .pakh files are "7KAP". I found quickbms and there is a script for 1KAP but i cant find any info about 7kap.
