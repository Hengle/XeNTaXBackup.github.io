- Post Title: How do you learn something new

What kinds of things would motivate you to learn something new?
For example, I find myself doing things that I am familiar with more often than doing something I have never done before.

I'm typically more willing to refine skills I have already took the time to develop, and hopefully pick up more skills by branching out from there.
But it doesn't always work that way.

you can challenge yourself by working in different software environments. you've done some python stuff with neosis? try using 3ds maxscript, or maya (melscript?). being by porting stuff.

you say branch out, is there anything specific you have in mind?

Not really. Just learning new stuff by building on what I already know.
For example, python in noesis ==> python in blender. LOL

Though, importing in noesis ==> importing in blender/max/etc would be another way to look at it as well.

Tried to get into 2D formats...but just wasn't trying much.

if you haven't wrote anything for blender, that's the next step - i guess it just uses different api calls to do the same thing (only now you can edit stuff too..)

2d formats - textures? i couldn't get into that either - most graphic formats are dds variants and just headless or using some preset options

have you done much reverse engineering? i just found [https://www.hackthissite.org/missions/application/](https://www.hackthissite.org/missions/application/) which is pretty rewarding

I started off programming in Commodore Basic (VIC-20). But then I got an MSX. And started programming in MSX Basic, picking up something from Spectravideo Basic before the switch. I then got a C64. So back to Commodore Basic. But I then focused more on machine code, as that was the only way to go. So I got cartridges that allowed me to program in assembly. 
Then after some years, I signed up for a course on Bioinformatics, as was taught to program in Turbo Pascal. Very nice, but I wanted to do more and switched to Turbo C, combined with PC Assembly, as I was still convinced assembly is the only real way to create programs that are as fast as possible. At some point, I needed to make a switch to a Windows environment, and I needed a quick and dirty way, not having too much time anymore. I turned to Visual Basic. And still do a lot in that language, even though I created some supportive tools in Visual C. I also taught myself all kinds of other languages, like PHP, QuickBasic, HTML, DOS batches etc. But to be motivated you must have a clear goal in mind, what do I REALLY want to achieve. And for me it is then: okay, good, now WHAT is the shortest rout? This or that language? Good, we start today.

For me, it's what intrigues me or what somewhat leads me to get better in something I'm interested in.

Like I went from liking games and drawing to where I am now that likes to sprite and design 3D models and textures and so on and so forth to this day.
Might lead me somewhere else later, who knows.

Other than that... it's more of it I'm curious or nosey enough.
