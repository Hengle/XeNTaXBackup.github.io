- Post Title: Reverse Enginner - Boxer Assets from Real Boxing 2 - ROCKY

A very good day to you Sir 

I hope you are doing Great Sir !

I have downloaded the Android APK of Real Boxing 2 - ROCKY

I have extracted all the Boxer Assets 

They are all in Unreal Engine Format

These include all the Boxer 3D Blueprints and Animation 

Is there anyway to reverse engineer with all the 3D Blueprints and Animations to make a Boxing Game Prototype in Unreal Engine 4 ?

Hope to hear from you soon.

Thank you very much for your time and kind help.
