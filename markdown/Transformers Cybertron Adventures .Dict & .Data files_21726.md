- Post Title: Transformers: Cybertron Adventures .Dict & .Data files

Hi everyone, I've been trying to extract the models and textures from this game, but various 3D ripper programs export it's models a bunch of *split* chunks that need to be reassembled.

I figured instead of spending consuming months reassembling this stuff, I could just take it from the files itself. But the files themselves are in a format both related to each other (from what I've looked up) called .Dict and .Data. The Luigi's Mansion game used this format aswell, but there seems to be little to none documentation on how to get into them.

Any help would be appreciated, here's a link to one of the files.

This is the Wii version of  Transformers: War for Cybertron which has full support using gildors tool
the PC version probably has higher poly meshes, so would be better any way

This isn't the same engine as the console/pc version. The reason why I am trying to rip the models from the Wii version is because there was some bonus content (Enemy models, music, ect) not present in those versions.
