- Post Title: ARKdumper help needed.

I'm still trying to unpack the files from the My LittlePony Gameloft game but I'm getting this problem where the folders for the unpacked .ark files are empty. as if ARKdu,per skipped over much of their contents which i could only see for a split second.

could someone identify the problem? Is it a problem with the app, the ARKdumper program or something else?
