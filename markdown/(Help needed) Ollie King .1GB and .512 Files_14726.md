- Post Title: (Help needed) Ollie King .1GB and .512 Files

So, I would like to rip from the game Ollie King (a Skateboarding game for the SEGA Chihiro), I used chdman to dump convert it to .bin/.cue and dumped the data track and its files with ISOBuster. However, the game's data comes in these strange file formats like .1GB and .512 (with the exception of 2 .BIN files). I used offzip on the .512 and .1GB files only to get a bunch of 1kb .dat files and some 100+kb ones with the exception of .zzz, .tat, .0, etc., I just figured that the files offzip extracted were just junk files. So, Since I have no idea how to reverse engineer the .1GB or .512 files (cause I have no knowledge of BMS and all that coding shit whatsoever, so I cant make a script), could anyone help me out and maybe find a solution to cracking open these files? Thanks.

Here are the files btw:
