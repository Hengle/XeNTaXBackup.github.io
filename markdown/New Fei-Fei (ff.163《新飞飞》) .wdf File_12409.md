- Post Title: New Fei-Fei (ff.163/《新飞飞》) .wdf File

Hey,

I'm trying to have a look on this MMO files.
The game has pretty awesome models.

Here's what I got to ''help'':

Name: New Fei-Fei/ff.163/cFlyff/《新飞飞》
Site: [http://ff.163.com](http://ff.163.com)
Download: [http://ff.163.com/download/](http://ff.163.com/download/) 
(sample files would be too huge, as the things are packed together, i.e: all models/textures in one .wdf file - so downloading from source will be better)

I think this all I got.

Thanks.
