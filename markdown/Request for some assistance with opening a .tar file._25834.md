- Post Title: Request for some assistance with opening a .tar file.

Hi, I have a .tar file generated by a 3D printer, I would like to look at its content however cannot do so as it looks to not be a standard .tar file that can be extracted with 7zip or using the standard tar command.

The file is huge so I cannot really upload it for assistance but is there any other info that I could provide that would help with figuring out how to extract it?
