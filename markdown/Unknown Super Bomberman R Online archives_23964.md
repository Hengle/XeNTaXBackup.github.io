- Post Title: Unknown Super Bomberman R Online archives

so i've been trying to extract the audio for super bomberman r online, wich is a unity 2019 game, and there's this weird no extension files and a manifest file that accompanies said file

it gets more weirder in the main file, as there's no clue or header in it at all


this might be just encrypted, i dunno, i've saw ppl that figured out how to rip these before, wich was on super bomberman r (wich uses the same weird files), i'm a total noob to this so a way to extract these files without installing any kind of unity sdks would be welcome (and if that is the only option then i would have to just free up space on my drive for it then)

here's a sample of said files if anybody wants to inspect them

cheers!

The audio all seems to be in FSB5 format, so use this QuickBMS script to extract them.
