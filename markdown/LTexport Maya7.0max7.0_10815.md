- Post Title: LTexport Maya7.0/max7.0

Dear community,

i don't know if this is the right place to ask my request. I hope it.
I'm working with the Lithtech Jupiter engine.
The Lithtech Jupiter engine have several plugins for maya 7.0 and 3dsmax 7.0 and older version ( jeah pretty old :/ ).
My problem is that when i create a model in maya7.0 and want to export it with the "ltexport" plugin to export the model into an .lta ( ) it doesn't convert the geometry :S
Is there a solution? Can someone maybe look over?

Sincerely Zenshin
