- Post Title: Wrestlemania 21 Wrestler Model Modifications request

Hello, now i know wm21 the game is modelable i'm fully aware of Xentax forum admins succesfully filling out someones request. But i was wondering if it's possible to edit the model of a wrestler I.E. Make Superstar Undertaker have Kanes Legs, if this is possible i would love to know. I don't know what to attatch as a file so.. i'll look.

Maybe theres something to do with .K files?

This might be a good request for Xela? In the Models forum?

They stored a lot of stuff in the models. I saw Morph data using morph targets for lipsync and clothing. I had it all worked out at one point but the forum I was doign it in folded due to idiocy. Jasmine knows what I'm talking about. 

Plus there just wasn't enough interest.

Do you still know how to access the data points in the .K files which tell which wrestler to have certain body parts?
