- Post Title: Gamecube Game .GCP files.

Hey guys! I'm here with a real baffler. This is a game archive that has gone largely unnocticed by the extraction community. I'm not talking about the memory card gcp's, I'm talkign about the resource file gcp's. Yes, apparently in a lot of Nickelodeon games this format is prominent, and from what I can tell it's used for just about anything. Sounds, models, and various other types of data. The only thing it DOESN'T seem to contain, I noticed, are the video resources, such as FMV's. We'll get to those after this. Anyway, I was hoping someone could have a look at these and tell me how to extract the models and audio resources from these files? I'm more aiming for models however, and they're the most important thing to me, the audio is a secondary priority.
