Mortal Kombat 11 tool

Drop XXX file onto EXE, and it will export all skeletal and static models and textures.
oo2core_5_win64.dll from the game must be in the same dir.
If XXX package has corresponding PSF file, it must be in the same dir.



Test version with support for morphs, material info etc:

thank you so much, this is so impressive! once you have the models, i'd be glad to take care of converting them to xps or other usable formats. do you think there will be a way to get textures? if not, ninja ripper could probably do it

Tried it out on the switch files (from the cartridge, not the update data itself), and it only gives me a 21kb unpacked file.

noob extraction - drag and drop gearassets_noo_scriptassets.xxx onto mk11_model.exe, then look for the folders in my screenshot (models, statics, textures); you'll need models and textures. load the mesh.ascii into blender (you'll need the xnalara/xps plugin for this) and look for the correct textures to apply

in general - i'm having problems with textures, some of them export looking like this (this is shinnok's head from the bone temple, or at least it's supposed to be). please help

think you'll be able to add switch support? Would like to see if there's any model differences between PC and Switch (besides shaders).

amazing job with the tool, daemon1
I only have one problem, some of the .xxx files I tried processing with the tool don't export any textures, for example KollectionArt1.xxx should have every concept art unlockable, looking at the KollectionArt1.export.txt file it seems it doesn't have any Texture2D files but a bunch of .BinaryBlobCompressedImage ones, is there a chance the tool can be updated to export this? if not, what would be the best way to do it without the tool?

Hello there, i was testing the tool a few days ago, it seems to work great on the characters, i see all the outfits and gear pieces in there with the textures.

Then i tried to test it on the Krypt, to get some NPCs and other stuff, and here’s when i came across my first pronlem. I kept testing the tool with individual Krypt files, there are some cases where it extracts only textures of certain things, but not the model they belong to. In other cases, it doesn’t seem to get everything at all

I can list you the name of the .xxx packages i used here for you to check if you like. In other words, i really appreciate all the work you put into this, just like with your Injustice 2 tool

there are no Skeletal meshes in the files with Krypt on their name, expect a few levers and weapons

there are only Kenshi and Goro static statues

I've tried to figure out how to export to the models from the .xxx files but I can't figure it out. I'm only looking for Scorpion and Sub-Zero if anyone has already exported those models.

Thanks!

You can export the UV map with blender and open it in photoshop as a new layer, on the diffuse one. Then, you can isolate the part you want to color with the select tool, and play with color hue/saturation and the layer mode options (multiply, overlay, soft light...). Idk if that's the best way... but I got some results with it.

First, you have to select the mesh in blender with the edit mode and you will see the UV map in UV/Image editor. Then, export the UV map as an image with UV menu and "export UV Layout" option. If thit is not clear (english is not my native language), check on google or youtube, there are a lot of tutorials.

Try "SEK_GEAR_A_001_Color0" for the head and "SEK_SKIN_A_Color0" for the full body.

Using "SEK_Story.mesh" (model) with the two textures which I referred worked fine for me.

It would be very interesting to be able to modify this game, maybe you could update this extraction program in the future to be able to import models, maybe when game has a pirated version.

You gotta make sure the game.EXE and oo2core_5_win64.dll filename.xxx and filename.psf are in the same directory.
Also look for the files that start with GEARASSETS*.xxx, those contain the character models/gear/skins

use noesis to export to tga format, then open the tga with xnview and remove the alpha channel! that should do the trick

Scorpion Model. Ive been reading of how you guys are building the models and extracting the textures. I have to admit some of you are doing it the hard way lol. There are a couple ways of doing this, I usually use neosis to convert, then import to 3DMax using Gildor Plugin then Mirror the rig with the object Since the extraction extracts models in wrong direction. I then export to Maya or Lightwave3D for the rest.

As for textures i open the DDS all in Photoshop and color them in by using a overlay or multiply, real easy but time consuming depending on the character lol. I been told i should mention part of my process on this forum from a friend lol, so i did.

Tool extracts models as correct original data.
Since UE uses left-handed coordinate system, if you load it in right-handed editor, such as 3dmax, it will look mirrored

Has anyone found the story mode character textures for the models? Those models are complete but their UVs are different than the skins. Plus the story mode models have bones working for the face.

Story mode models aren't worth the trouble imo. They're lower poly and the face rigging is very sloppy. Will keep a look out for the textures though.

I know where the models are stored. I'm saying that I don't have the GEARASSETS_SHA_ScriptAssests.psf or the .psf for Shang Tsung or Kano to get the models.

Actually story models range in the 90 thousand polys, same as other full models, they just been broken up in a different way that's why the UV are different also. Its due to NRS outsourcing.

Hey guys, How do you merge armatures in blender? I'm not sure if that's a thing, but when I import different parts of the same character, it creates a new armature and I just want one whole armature if that makes sense.

Thanks!

I use more 3dmax, but i think you have to select all the armatures then press CTRL+J

New test version:
- face morphs exported
- skeletal models mirrored



I will probably work a little more on it, with possible support for material information and maps.

Thanks very much for the update daemon. I was wondering, how did you get all of the morphs loaded into the face mesh at once? or did you import every morph (mesh.ascii) model manually and join them with the face model as shape keys?

Here is Scorpion default skin for his base skin. Depending on what program you use, there will be differences. In my case i used the alpha from NORM DDS for his alpha in COLOR DDS to get a quick diffuse. Try it out and see what happens. GL

I have adobe ps and can't get this result. does it make a difference if the textures are in tga or dds? i'm using tga.

My process is I open all DDS images of color, norm, rma, id, and tone. I take the alpha from NORM and replace the COLOR version so I have a quick diffuse. I then copy the ID DDS as a layer to COLOR DDS, I use the ID as a color palette to fill in the colors so I don’t miss anything. Then I just save it as a PSD. Then I use Lightwave 3D for all my renders etc. This is one of a few ways to approach this.

New test version:
- face morphs exported
- skeletal models mirrored



I will probably work a little more on it, with possible support for material information and maps.

Thanks for sharing your amazing work with us all Daemon.
Is there any way to import the body animations into 3DS Max as well by any chance ?

I have had some successes but if i stop for 1 month i forget so much. Encryption always kicks my butt 
General reverse engineering is too broad.

Sup guys, I need some help looking for frost's props (supermove, Icecicles, Ice Wave, her fatality drone, kunai's used in victory, ect). It seems that the tool does not find all of the textures required for most of the props that are contained in "CyberFrost_"X"_Fatality" sadly, but a great tool nonetheless.

Here are some of the models that I was talking about [https://imgur.com/a/Kj1gkG5](https://imgur.com/a/Kj1gkG5)

Hello folks

I've been trying to extract the textures of various character models such as Kano for example. Some of the textures are fine like the mask maps but for some strange reason the face and body textures seem to be damaged? I can't open with nor Irfanview or photoshop it always tells me the the file header is broken.

I've extracted the meshes witch seem to work fine but without textures it wont help me much...

Any ideas?

Export the textures as TGA to get them open in photoshop, works for me (they are DDS currently and some programs cannot handle that file type)

They are specifically BC7(DX11) DDS textures which is not widely supported like BC5(DX10) DDS textures. It is annoying but you can convert them, say, in Noesis or XnConvert.

1.jpg

I search for a while, and, I think they don't exist.
Those model are for test animation as it can see here:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xldFD8jtQrY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xldFD8jtQrY)

So, its like impossible to find any texture of the fullbody as they don't exist.
And quite doubt someone could make texture that match the heads, because the heads & skin texture are really realistic

They do exist but they are grey with lines over the whole body, they usually are in the gear parts of the characters I've checked. They aren't very usable though considering they don't match the actual character's body proportions.

Open the textures with Photoshop or GIMP or any program that allow you to see the channels of the image.
Pretty much all have one on the alpha that its not an alpha, causing to turn white or transparent.

You were right! They're cover in lines! Even the normal map too.
But, they're on a extreme bad quality

Story mode models aren't worth the trouble imo. They're lower poly and the face rigging is very sloppy. Will keep a look out for the textures though.


Actually story models range in the 90 thousand polys, same as other full models, they just been broken up in a different way that's why the UV are different also. Its due to NRS outsourcing.

Where are the story mode Models if you dont mind me asking

It is not possible in 3dsMax, but for Blender daemon1 has the .py script somewhere in the forum included in quite a few tools released by him, don't remember right now which thread, so you'll have to hunt for it in his threads.

You didn't even search what I suggested, threads by daemon1, lets say Bloodborne or Final Fantasy Dssidia NT have the .py script for Noesis, or look for Blender XPS Tools to import in Blender.

Yeah, that is what I mostly do too, but, the model at times come out with very screw weight.
But, I couldn't import the XNALara format one, only SMD.


Yeah  , I still don't get how they can use Blender so easily and I'm here that can only import one thing

It sure does mess them up, big time, its a lot of trial and error, how about try export to glTF Model from Noesis, allegedly its better than anything out there according to Mr.Adults the Noesis dev, he keeps praising that format like no other.

The scripts for Blender that are created need to be updated/fixed, that is what causes all these issues.

Yeah, I give a shot, but got the same result:
Is this normally how it export the weight like this?

And I've try that new format, but, its only compatible with latest version of 3D Max (I use 2015).
But, my concern its more on the weight errors around the face

Face weights are like that because they didn't intend to use bones for the game, they use morphs. They seem to be placeholder weights that they never fixed up because they had no use for them. So this is how the game has them, it's no fault of format, script, program etc.

Cool, I though it was an error.
Still with place holders, I will give a shot for give weight around

People usually do this kind of stuff while using Cheat Engine as source (not talking about this game particularly, I wouldn't know, but swapping in general of geometry and stuff), yet if both characters use different base mesh/ skeletons, not sure if animations would work in-game, it would definitely crash up on loading it.
But hey you never know, Google Cheat Engine stuff and see what you come up with.

This is by no means an exclusive game such as console games that require an entire team of hackers to crack the hardware/software to gain access to game data, this is a Steam game that anyone can get/purchase, means you can go do just that to have what you need.

This is, at minimum, a 40 dollar game that my current computer is unable to play.  Add in the cost of DLC, or buy the premium edition, and the price jumps up around 100 dollars.  That's too much to pay just to be able to rip some models.

Jesus, I'm starting to wonder why I ever tried to get into this hobby!

I just asked if anyone could help me get the game files.  NOT the whole game, just the assets that would allow me to rip the models.  Like I said, my computer can't play MK11, so there's little point in buying the full game.  I made that mistake with Injustice 2; yeah, I can rip some pretty cool models, but that's ALL I can do (and it ended up costing me about $90).

daemon1, sorry for all this BS in your thread.

I think we all know why we already choose this hobby, this 3D fascinating world offers unlimited possibilities at so many levels as long as your creativity allows it and have enough spare time to let it manifest itself.

And also, there is no BS, unless you make it so, just think a little with an answer like yours of course it will come across as legit BS, just sayin .
I get I should have never bothered to say something and ignore, but think about it, so many already greedy people around who always want want want, and that's it, the level of entitlement is insane, my two cents.

This is BS.  This, was uncalled for.  Not being able to play the game is a legitimate reason not to buy it (which I ended up doing anyway).  To say I have no money, no shame?  When you know nothing of my situation, financially or otherwise?

Again, my apologies to daemon1 for all of this, I wasn't trying to hijack the thread.

@daemon1

Hi, please forgive changing the subject. I'm kind of new to the whole ripping assets off trade.

Anyways, after I moved the .xxx onto the .exe file, an error showed up, saying that the program stopped working. Is there a missing file that I need to download, or a step that I need to do correctly?

Also, the dialog box says that it's the Injustice2_model extractor that has stopped working. Do both games fall under the same extractor?

Does anyone know where the gear names are stored?

edited to clarify:  I mean the names that appear on the gear screen - like Cassie Cage's "It Girl" or "Beverly Hills 4ever" sunglasses.

OK, finally figured out where the names are stored - in the coalesced.eng file.  But that file is encrypted and I can't find any tool to open it.

Hello everyone, I'm new. I'm a beginner 3d artist. Tell me, is it difficult and possible to export character models from MK11? Maybe someone has a Kotal Kahn model? Tell me a topic or training video on the extracts models?

I've been able to extract most files flawlessly with this tool, but i've recently had an issue with it involving one of Jax's files

Specifically "CHAR_JAX_ScriptAssets"

I've been trying to extract his props, but every time I do, the Meathead and other gore models are extracted. The tool crashes before it can get anything else. If anyone knows a method on fixing this, that'd be nice

I followed this link in page 4, but under the asset folder, the model, texture and skeletalmesh.raw is empty. 
Did someone remove everything?

So I dumped Jokers model and the Skin A model isn't fully rigged, it only contains a default humanoid skeleton and leaves the coat tail and the front of the jacket without bones, it also comes with a dummy head attached, which makes me think it was a stand in model for development use. so I'm wondering if anyone knows where I can get the fully rigged body of the default skin, all the other skin files are rigged correctly

If anyone is curious about the color palette for the alt skins, they are found in the textures with CPT in the name, they are small gradient colors that are used for the ID color masks, I put together a shader for unity where you can input your own colors, still testing it on other models, it's only been tested on Joker

Do you think you could package the Joker's files as is for me? I'm pretty decent at rigging and I'd love to try my hand at him.

The hair texture is in the same folder as the face, skin and gear textures, and the beard uses the same texture as the hair, I just tried to be sure and it looked good.

if you use him outside of Unity, his texures will need to be manually colored, but I can if you want him, I don't have every face flex on him due to only using what was necessary for VRChat, he has his skeleton and I rigged the coat tail manually, but if you still want him add me on Discord, message me and I'll send you my info

Total noob here. Would anyone be able to tell me where to find gear specifically for Nightwolf? I want to remove the mask entirely from the Selfless Shaman headdress while keeping the wolf. Would this be possible by just making the mask transparent? If so, what would be the best way to do so for someone with little to no experience with editing textures? Thank you all!

Buy the game and support it like everyone else. Textures have to be manually recolored. the CPT0 textures show the color palettes used for the characters.

When you extract the character model from the GEAR_Assets container, it gives you a folder with the textures inside. the CTP shows you the colors used for the character skins in the game. like say if I wanted to get the correct colors for Baraka's default skin (SKIN_A), i'd look for "BAR_001_CPT0". Its a very small image with colors that you'd use as a reference for manually painting the SKIN_A texture in photoshop.

Anyone able to extract Joker_A_Fatality.XXX without the tool crashing? I'm trying to access Joker's tommy gun but both versions of the extractors crash before it can be extracted., however all the textures are extracted easily. If anyone knows any alternate methods of getting this fully extracted, that'd be great.

Ok guys ! Im big new here ! And i don't know many stuff even how to use this forum. So sorry if im doing something wrong.

I know it's not sure to get answer but i still hope someone can answer me !

I use blender and im looking for mk 11 model ! 

Wicker witch Jade.

I succed to get model but textures look "destroyed". When i try to put color in model it still purple like blender cannot identify it.



I try to convert .dds on many website, every website cannot convert it too !  And when I "forced" to open .dds it doesnt look like usual texture at all. 




Ok its the most important !

And my last question for user of blender. what mean each pic ? (i guess color = color, norm = normal map ... but others ?)



Thx!

EDIT : I tried to use .DDS of the Face and it work ! But clothes give a shit result like 



Don't know how to fix it

Use Noesis or another editor to convert textures to any common format (png, tif, tga).
The texture is fine. The color of the exposed parts of the body is correct, the color of the armor is determined by the mask. It looks like an ID0 texture.

Look at the skins. There are solid repaints. Keeping a different texture for everyone will take up a lot of space. And so you can store one mask and just change the color codes for each of the channels.

oK GUYS I succed u must join everything in one object. Create only one node with your mesh combined.

Then you create another windows with uv map. You take your color texture image in uv map. Then u select all your mesh in edit mode. it gonna show u all verticle of your  mesh in UV MAP. U just need to take a look if it fit or not. If it doesnt fit be carefull your image is maybe in wrong so u just need to moove all verticle mesh in good side to fit it. 

I dont know if u understand well what i said. but it will give u nice information

I came here and was just about to ask the same thing, haha.

I have everything extracted but was hoping there was a way to either recolour / correct the textures automatically or quicker.
I felt scared to ask in case i was just being really daft and it was in fact simple.

This is probably a dumb question, but what is the tone map? Is it a texture that can be utilized or is it akin to the ID texture where it only serves a purpose in the game engine? Other than that I've also been struggling to apply the textures optimally in Blender, I feel like I'm missing something. Thanks in advance for any help.

Tone map basically adds extra detail to the model. The green channel can act as a specular map or even an overlay for the diffuse/color texture. the blue can be used for adding dirt/grime or gloss to certain parts of the clothing.

Hi @daemon1,

Hope you are doing well.
Just wondering if you are still working on a map extractor like you did for injustice 2? I know you said that you were busy with other games, but I thought I'll ask if this is still something part of your plans.

Thank you for your amazing work!

Well whenever you do work on it, we'll be waiting. MK maps are very popular in the 3d community and some people such as myself will still be eager for them down the line. Thanks again for your hard work.

If anyone is curious about the color palette for the alt skins, they are found in the textures with CPT in the name, they are small gradient colors that are used for the ID color masks, I put together a shader for unity where you can input your own colors, still testing it on other models, it's only been tested on Joker

Is there a rule or list order to know what color in ID map file represent every color in CPT file?.

I may be wrong, but I understand that if I add the Color texture file to the Id mask file pre-processed with the CPT file it will make the final texture.

The .materials text file exported with the model might answer your question. Can't say for sure.

oK GUYS I succed u must join everything in one object. Create only one node with your mesh combined.

Then you create another windows with uv map. You take your color texture image in uv map. Then u select all your mesh in edit mode. it gonna show u all verticle of your  mesh in UV MAP. U just need to take a look if it fit or not. If it doesnt fit be carefull your image is maybe in wrong so u just need to moove all verticle mesh in good side to fit it. 

I dont know if u understand well what i said. but it will give u nice information

Can you provide more info on how to do it?

cutscenes are pre-rendered vids, so there's zilch chance of finding the story-cinematic versions of the shokan and tarkatan models i'm afraid.

So where are the character meshes assets or files names, since so far I found Shang Tsung Shokan disguise. I went after Sheeva's files, but got a friendship and objects, an arrow, table, a chalice, and a spear. Are there any "non-combatant character meshes" because I'd love to grab the generic male and female of the Shokan and Tarkatan as a base mesh.

There's a generic shokan male in Sheeva's intro files. There's some Tarkatans in the Tarkatan War Camp Map package. Since they're NPCs, they either have minimal rigging or low-res textures though.

Because I've run across the use of all 4 channels in other games since starting to do rip models, are there any maps that use channels differently say for roughness, specular, metallic maps? 

Is there like information in a post that tells us which layer for which map goes where?

Thanks

As far as I can tell, the RMAO texture is used for (R channel) R=Roughness, (G channel )M=Metal, (Blue channel) AO=Ambientocclusion. The roughness can also be found on the alpha channel of a normal map.

Depends on what you mean by "clean texture", if you mean the character model textures, they're labeled as JAD_SKIN_A, JAD_SKIN_B, etc. Her face is JAD_FACE_A,etc.

That's what I figured.  I tried re-extracting with the same results.  I just ended up using someone else's textures

could you share in which xxx archive you found his disguise? while the model is the same as the one included in sheeva's intro, the textures are different.

additionally, would anybody know if models of the female shokan and male+female osh-tekk are included in some of the archives? thanks in advance.

Hi. 

I was trying to get the animations from the xxx files and notices that some are replaced or missing form the extraction when multiple names exists. Here an example with Johnny (See Taunts and Walkaways from End of round)

Hi.

First, thanks to the creator of this great tool.
I know this is an old thread but I will post my question.

I've tried to extract anim form the game and mostly all anims are extracted and works fien. Nevertheless I think there is an issue when multiple names exists in those anims files. When the unp extracts it will only retrieve one of those names but count all the existing entries. For example:

JOHN End of Round Taunts:
1 - After extract .xxx (.export.txt file)
C7 A206C4 B0DE ->19C EndOfRound_Winner_Taunt_1.AnimSequence
1C8 A2B7A2 13542 ->19C EndOfRound_Winner_Taunt_2.AnimSequence
1C9 A3ECE4 58F6 ->19C EndOfRound_Winner_Taunt_2_JOH_Sunglasses_A.AnimSequence
1CA A445DA A19E ->19C EndOfRound_Winner_Taunt_2_JOH_Sunglasses_A_2ndPair.AnimSequence
1CB A4E778 7D176 ->19C EndOfRound_Winner_Taunt_3.AnimSequence
1CC ACB8EE 9272 ->19C EndOfRound_Winner_Taunt_3_JOH_Marker_A.AnimSequence
1CD AD4B60 13532 ->19C EndOfRound_Winner_Taunt_3_JOH_Picture_A.AnimSequence
1CE AE8092 80FDA ->19C EndOfRound_Winner_Taunt_4.AnimSequence
1CF B6906C 917A ->19C EndOfRound_Winner_Taunt_4_JOH_Beeper_A.AnimSequence
1D0 B721E6 10C46 ->19C EndOfRound_Winner_Taunt_5.AnimSequence
1D1 B82E2C 70AC2 ->19C EndOfRound_Winner_Walkaway_1.AnimSequence
1D2 BF38EE AFC4A ->19C EndOfRound_Winner_Walkaway_2.AnimSequence
1D3 CA3538 17F92 ->19C EndOfRound_Winner_Walkaway_3.AnimSequence
1D4 CBB4CA 13346 ->19C EndOfRound_Winner_Walkaway_4.AnimSequence
1D5 CCE810 AE8A ->19C EndOfRound_Winner_Walkaway_4_JOH_BoomMic_A.AnimSequence
1D6 CD969A 1187E ->19C EndOfRound_Winner_Walkaway_5.AnimSequence

2 - The unp extracts:
EndOfRound_Winner_Taunt
EndOfRound_Winner_Taunt
EndOfRound_Winner_Taunt_2_JOH_Sunglasses_A
EndOfRound_Winner_Taunt_2_JOH_Sunglasses_A_2ndPair
EndOfRound_Winner_Taunt
EndOfRound_Winner_Taunt_3_JOH_Marker_A
EndOfRound_Winner_Taunt_3_JOH_Picture_A
EndOfRound_Winner_Taunt
EndOfRound_Winner_Taunt_4_JOH_Beeper_A
EndOfRound_Winner_Taunt
EndOfRound_Winner_Walkaway
EndOfRound_Winner_Walkaway
EndOfRound_Winner_Walkaway
EndOfRound_Winner_Walkaway
EndOfRound_Winner_Walkaway_4_JOH_BoomMic_A
EndOfRound_Winner_Walkaway

It shows all number of the Taunts and Walkaway entries but only one of those is written, the other 4 (4 for Taunt and 4 for Walkway) are discarded.

I am asking if the author could make some changes to the unpack anim executable to handle this. It would be very nice to have those End of the Round anim files.

I'll leave here the link to JOH files (xxx, psf and unp): [https://mega.nz/file/oh1gzDrC#ZTABp_7mx ... _bvfZDppgQ](https://mega.nz/file/oh1gzDrC#ZTABp_7mxRCoEAb3CXF7OkHJl8uAXm8Wx_bvfZDppgQ)

Hello, I seek some help here if possible.

I'm searching for a specific mesh, Drahmin's Mask from the Krypt, I'm positive it's located in BGND_Krypt_ShangTsungIsland.xxx

[https://sta.sh/02fg4z0t0c2z](https://sta.sh/02fg4z0t0c2z)

I've seen the textures come out of here, but not the static model, as a matter of fact there are various other static models there that don't come out after extraction, is there a way to get more meshes out of a package?

Afraid those models aren't in the game files from what I can see. I've been trying to find that mask as well as the fatality heads that go in the Warrior Shrine to no avail. I think it has to do with most sections of the Krypt being streamed online. Best bet of getting it is ninjaripper.

Hii guys, how are yall? Is anyone know if Skarlet have a base body texture? Like, from her entire body? Only found full body base on the files i got and i needed to try to create a custom skin without using piece of texture clothes that are mixed with the body textures. Thanks a lot for any info.

No, none of the characters have full body skins.  None of the characters have full bodies.  The "full body" meshes that get extracted are generic bases and don't include full textures.
