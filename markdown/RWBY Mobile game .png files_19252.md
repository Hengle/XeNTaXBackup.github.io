- Post Title: RWBY Mobile game .png files

So it says png for the image files but they clearly arent.
 I checked the files in a hex editor and the header says PQK... I can't find anything related to that.

I've attached some samples, any help would be appreciated.

Could you provide more files?
I think that the files are XORed, with more files it could be possible to obtain the cypher.

I've packed all graphic files in zip: [https://mega.nz/#!lp5ywabZ!9WB3UznfH5wp ... pw-kUJJu2A](https://mega.nz/#!lp5ywabZ!9WB3UznfH5wpX3vowlJS8fLezkJU01lnopw-kUJJu2A)

Please, help to decrypt those images.
