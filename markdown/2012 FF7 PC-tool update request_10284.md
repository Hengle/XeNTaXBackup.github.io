- Post Title: 2012 FF7 PC-tool update request

in 2012 ff7 was re-released. unfortunately however, the tools, especially for graphic modding, did not get an update. Kimera, for example, does not work anymore on win7 x64. I'd like to request an easier, more powerful tool for model and animation editing for FF7. anybody interested?

Noesis does this to an extent, but no editing, right?
