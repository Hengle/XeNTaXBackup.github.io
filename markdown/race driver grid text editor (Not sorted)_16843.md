- Post Title: race driver grid text editor (Not sorted)

The process of opening the file (Race Driver GRID.exe) is OK. 
However, if you go through the save process, you will get an error in the language file (language_eng.lng) because the internal sorting is not done. 
Ask for help to handle language files normally.
