- Post Title: APB: Reloaded .bnk

So I've managed to extract the sounds from the wwise soundbank (.bnk) and converted them to ogg to mak sure they are the sounds i wanted etc.

Now what i want to do is extract them in their unplayable .wav format (easy) swap in sounds from a previous version of the game which i have also extracted to the .wav format (easy) but here's the hard part, I then need to re-pack them back into the .bnk archive. I have tried the .bnk extractor/packer that was designed for TDU but as i suspected that didn't work at all 

Anyone got any ideas as to how i can repack these files? I'd like to avoid learning how to make a re-pack script ;-; (is that even possible in quickBMS?)

Edit: I'd like to mention this is not the .bnk_pc format used in Saint's Row games, I am aware that there is a working tool for that format though it is not the one i seek.
