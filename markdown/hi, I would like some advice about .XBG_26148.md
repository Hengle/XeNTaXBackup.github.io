- Post Title: hi, I would like some advice about .XBG

hi, I've been looking for a solution for opening or an asset for Bladener for some time, for opening .XBG, but unfortunately I haven't found anything, and if anyone here has any variations or a procedure, I would be very obliged for advice or a link, Thank you very much. Otherwise, I already solved .XBT
