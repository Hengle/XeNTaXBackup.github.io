- Post Title: ckd textures for Switch

I have some textures for Just Dance on Nintendo Switch. However, they seem to use a different header from Wii U's Gfx2 header and PS4's standard DDS header and I'm not sure how to extract them. Attached is the header and here are the textures I am trying to extract. [https://mega.nz/#F!EQVQ1IzT!9SS4bs98Nu4atS1HHtzz1w](https://mega.nz/#F!EQVQ1IzT!9SS4bs98Nu4atS1HHtzz1w)
