Does anyone know how to extract/disassemble these files highlighted below? The same file formats appears to be in other Disney games such as Disney Infinity and Cars 2. I was told from other users that the .oct file is where the textures are stored and the .tbb are the models. Any help is appreciated.

Why don't you try the PC version, as far as I know there is a python script for an old version of Blender here in the forum that works, or get the script add-on and try it in Blender on your extracted files.
