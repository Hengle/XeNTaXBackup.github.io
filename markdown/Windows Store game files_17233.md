- Post Title: Windows Store game files

Hi, not exactly game archive but related topic. Essentially I am struggling with copying or accessing game files related to games downloaded from Microsoft Store. Even though I am the only user and have admin privilege, I still cant copy files from the 'WindowsApps' folder. I have tried most of the tips I could get online, i.e. change the ownership etc. I can at least view the content inside the folders, but it won't allow me to copy any file to a different location. Keeps on giving me the 'You need permissions from Administrator' error. Has anyone got any experience in dealing with such game files?

Sometimes the game data is encrypted. Try use UWPDumper.
