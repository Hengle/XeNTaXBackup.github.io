Hmm, I thought I had tested that archive OK. Never mind, I will take a look at it. Thanks mate.

Hi again,

I tested this archive again and it works fine - however I am using the demo archives. If you could do a FileCutter of this archive, I will be happy to look at it and try to find the problem.

Actually, I think someone else just emailed me with the cause of the problem - it is failing because the archive is over 2.15 GB in size (about 3GB so I believe), so I will need to make some adjustments to resolve the problem.

I am sorry about this, I havn't anticipated the problem ever occurring - but the good news is that it can be fixed.
