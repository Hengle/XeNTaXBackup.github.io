Some questions to ask before I can try and figure out what you're doing wrong / if I can help you out :

1) What is the exact version of the Unreal Engine the game uses?

2) What tool/program are you using to unpack the pak file?

3) What tool/program are you using to 'repack' the modified files into a pak file?

4) What files are you modifying?

5) Are you repacking the modified files along with unmodifed files into a whole pak file, or are you repacking only the modified files into a patch pak file?

6) Provide some sample text in English you wish to translate, and is easy to check if they're reflected in game.
