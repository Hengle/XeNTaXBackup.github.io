How about a thread to list the best websites to get your hands on some cool finished mods? 

I'll start with an obvious one, and list any others here posted by you as well as you go.

Mod The Sims is a 'swell place for anyone who's looking for quality Sims 2/3 mods. Most of them are original works, and while there are conversions, only those taken from Sims games and/or royalty-free resources are allowed.

No mention of the almighty Nexus? 

They opened the floodgates a while back, so it's not even just Bethesda RPGs anymore, but any games.

^ An interesting thing about that site is the developers (Volition) are actually interested in helping with modding, and answer modding questions on the forum. As far as I know it's one of a kind in that respect.

Yeah, but mostly still just Bethesda games. Most of the other games on the site don't have much, so if there's another mod site for a specific game you're modding, you'll probably be better off just going to that one.

Total War Series
[http://www.totalwarcenter.net/](http://www.totalwarcenter.net/)
The site for everything Total War. This site hosts the greatest total conversions and many tools developed by members of the community.
If you dig for them, you can still find the threads in which desperate modders (including my humble self) tried to wrap their heads around the campaign map files of Empire:TW...   
Alas, TCs that don't take place on the vanilla map remain impossible, hence the forum sections revolving around Rome 1 and Medieval 2 still being very active to this day.

Then there are game dev studios that actually encourage modding, of course, hence their official forums being the main hub for modding of their games, such as...
All Strategy-Games by Paradox Interactive
[http://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/](http://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/)

...and...
(Almost) All Games by Frictional Games (Penumbra series, Amnesia:TTD)
