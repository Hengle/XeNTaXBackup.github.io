- Post Title: Extraction help: Sega Saturn Bootleg Sampler

I'm looking for a way to extract the main menu music from the demo disc(or at least find the name of the music), but I'm coming up very much short with every search and everyone I've asked so far 

I don't know much of anything about the Saturn's file formats unfortunately, and when viewing the files on the actual disc what I'm seeing is:
{'BB' folder}


The CK and SR folders are full of files for the Clockwork Knight and Sega Rally demos, but the BB folder has a larger number of files and a few sub-folders that include many more .BIN files and a few .CPK files. I'd read a little bit about how some files would be hidden within these, but what should I use to check them? Or is there somewhere else I should be looking? The BB folder seems like the place to go due to the number of files and how some of the .BIN files appear large enough to contain other files within them, but I'm really at a loss as to what to do with them. I'm using an ISO extraction program to view the files on my system currently, but it lacks any ability to do anything beyond extraction.


Can anyone help this poor clueless soul?

EDIT: Er, did I need to attach any of the files or anything?

Well, I came across this thread through a google search, and with you included, there are now at least 3 people I know who like that menu track and wanted it ripped.

The music is in a "tracker" format played back on the Saturn. I've ripped it a while ago when tools became available for the job. Here you go:

Somehow this track makes me think of music in Sentinel Returns by John Carpenter.
