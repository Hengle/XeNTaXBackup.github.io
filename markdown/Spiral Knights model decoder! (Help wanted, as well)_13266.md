- Post Title: Spiral Knights model decoder! (Help wanted, as well)

If you're looking for the decoder...
Today's your lucky day!
You can get the Spiral Knights model to .OBJ program [here!](http://forums.spiralknights.com/en/node/111668) (There's a tutorial on that github link)

To make sure it's legal:
I had a chat with the guys at Three Rings about their TOS - Technically I'm not breaking TOS because I am not "reverse-engineering" their code, but instead using their open-source files to get what I want. And besides, I posted it on their own forum awhile back when the program was in baby-steps and they didn't give two craps about it!

As of now, here's what it can and can't do (Plans are on the README.MD file on the Repository.)
What it can do:
 • Read XMLs exported by Spiral Spy*

What it can't do (yet):
 • Read .DAT from Spiral Knights (HELP ME GET THIS DONE PLEASE!!)

*Spiral Spy is a model viewer that uses Three Rings (The creators of the game)'s code to view models as well as export as .XML - You can find this code at [http://www.threerings.net/code/](http://www.threerings.net/code/) - The libraries it uses are Clyde, Narya, and Nenya.
