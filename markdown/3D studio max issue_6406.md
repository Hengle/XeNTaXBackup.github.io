- Post Title: 3D studio max issue

So I downloaded 3D studio max cause most of the export scripts here are written for it.
When I started it up, the "workspace" (don't know what to call it) doesn't appear correctly.

Perhaps my computer sucks or my graphics card sucks (or both, very likely), but basically the workspace is frozen. If I open a menu that expands over the workspace and then close the menu, you can still see it over the workspace.

I can import models using the scripts and I can export them to other formats, but I just can't see it in the workspace 

Is it because 3D studio requires huge amounts of resources which I may not have?

What in particular do you NOT understand about talking about warez and crackz in the forum rules?

Hi finale00!

since 3D studio has no issue but with you i can say that it is hardware compatibility issue i.e. you need a better graphics card in order to work on 3D studio  

so i suggest that the topic name should be "Graphics cards issue"   

Thanks

Try switching -h and setup with software graphics option. If its a card issue it will work, however slow, it will work. if its doesn't then its something else.
