Thanks for the reply, I've tried to deal with the other file, but I go out like this (sorry for the bad english, I'm Russian and I use Google-Translate)

Aurora is used for 3D model, and everything else 2D

Hi 
Here is an importer for 3d models from this game.
It requires Blender249 and Python26.
In Blender Text Window press alt+p and select:  
- *.m3d.ckd - mesh
- *.s3d.ckd - skeleton  
- *.tga.ckd - images
