Hi there, just wanted to ask if anyone is willing to help me extract the .lzs files of the game. All the main files are in .lzs format. I wanted to extract the language files mainly so that we can start translating the game into other languages (it's only out in Japan, Korean, Chinese languages rn). Thanks!
