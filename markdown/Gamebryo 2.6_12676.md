Hey guys!

Someone works with Noesis 3D? I tested Noesis with models using Gamebryo 2.0.6.0.0, Noesis open mesh without problem but unfortunately have problem to open animations.

Cheers.

use Noesis to load h_m_929.kf then h_m.nif.
The character will move his fingers then.

h_m_010.kf will turn the head a little bit.

Tested with last version of fmt_gamebryo_nif.py

(Enable the debug log to see the warnings for animations that don't work.)

The animation does not work properly.
