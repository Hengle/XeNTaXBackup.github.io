Since the game has been updated, Chroxx's script doesnt not working anymore with new models from the game.
I create this post to ask that somebody could update or making new script to work with this game.
Some samples is here you can try this using Chroxx's script or the Blender script try to open it and let see what I said

Made slight changes to chrrox's script. Just the things that I noticed at first glance. Seems to work fine with your sample, but don't know if it will work for all files.

Oh nice. Thank you very much
But does this update only work with character models? Not working with monster files
Can you check this

Here a maxscript for all meshes that have par Version 259 (par Version 515 is for not finished Mobs --> has no bones or weights thats why this script will ignore them)


changing this in the script causes
anim=1 --> how many animations want to import
meshes=1--> how many meshes will be imported
more animations at once or more meshes at once .

The Script opens all 3 files bone mesh and Animation... You need select each file. it needs all 3 files to work

Edit: you See only the files the Script needs current.. First it Shows only bone files then only mesh files and last only Animation files
