- Post Title: Mass for the Dead extraction?

Hi all,

I'm looking to get a hold of the models of the game in question and I haven't had much luck looking elsewhere, but I saw that someone had some success from another thread on here ([viewtopic.php?f=16&t=24400](https://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=24400)). I've run into a couple of roadblocks while following the method in that thread I was hoping that posting my own thread would get some attention (since the other thread seems dead) and hopefully learn something for future reference.

My current dilemma is that while I was able to plug in the BMS script from that thread and seemingly decrypted everything, I haven't had any luck being able to open the ASSET files that were created. Normally, I'd think you'd used something like AssetStudio for what I'm assuming are Unity files, but I can't crack them open. I've also tried using AssetBundle, TinyRipper, and others with no luck. I feel like it's something super obvious, like I'm using the wrong programs completely, but I'm just baffled at this point.


If anyone wants to look through the files, here's a DropBox of the decrypted files after using the AdaptiveKeyDec script from that XenTaX thread: [https://www.mediafire.com/folder/40m3924y9kgh2/u](https://www.mediafire.com/folder/40m3924y9kgh2/u)

If you would rather look at the unaltered files, there's a download for them the XenTaX thread I linked.


Thanks a lot.
