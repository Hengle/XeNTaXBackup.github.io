- Post Title: Dawn of War II Retribution models

I finally got some where close to the Dawn of War II models from the topic below. 

[FROM THIS TOPIC](http://forums.relicnews.com/showthread.php?244744-TOOL-Santos-Tools-2-UPDATED-21-06-FX-Editor-0.2.0-BETA-released!)

By using the SGA2 extractor and Santos Tools 2 I was able to view the models from the model viewer supplied by Santos 2 Tools. Unfortunately the scripts to import and export the models are only for 3DS Max 10, or so it would seem, since installing the tools it copies the scripts to /program files/autodesk/Max2010 folder.

Anyway, regardless of the version of Max I do not have 3D Studio Max since it is way to expensive to own.

I am hoping for some kind person to make a blender or python script to convert the DOW II models to something useful that can be imported in to something like Blender or Metasequio.

I am not sure what file actually contains the models, so I hope I am attaching something useful.

I only need the static mesh, no animations / bones etc are needed. Just the model with the texture.

Thanks for any help.

Here is the model of the Sentinel extracted from the SGA archives.

Sorry about uploading to MediaFire, I wanted to attach it here but was unable to.
