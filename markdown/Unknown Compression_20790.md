- Post Title: Unknown Compression

I have a compressed file, and a potential uncompressed file. It looks like a custom compression. I used comtype_scan.bat without any result.
The uncompressed file is from PC version of the same file, and compressed file is from the PS4 version of the same file.
The uncompressed size of PS4 version is 37066.

The both files are compiled lua files.
Try this: [https://github.com/viruscamp/luadec](https://github.com/viruscamp/luadec)
The PS4 file might be smaller because of optimization or cutout of redundant data.
