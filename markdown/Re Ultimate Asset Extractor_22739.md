For speaking TLOU Part 2, No it only supports skels, meshes, textures, and animations for now. But I can add support for audio files later.

Besides TLOU2 this contains about 20 of my other tools without my permission.

In short, you used the work of people who wrote programs to extract data from games, and you used their work, combined them into one universal program, and you demand money for it, im right?
Or you make extraction tool yourself for all this games?

Most of the game extraction tools in my program are made by me but yes, I took a few game tools from other people, but it will be edited as other people demanded asap.

This is completely stolen work from others. He changed icons, renamed files, recompiled with his name on it, or hex edited things to say he made it. 
None of it is his.

Do not buy this.

Wait a minute, hm, ok, I gave a thumbs up, now I had to remove it, I had no clue what this was really about up until I read closely, wow'ed.
OP, this is highly unethical from all points, no matter how you look at it, and I think you jus lost respect on all fronts, you should have NEVER made it a pay app off of other developers/reversers hard work, be it even a one simple line of code, period.
If it would have been fully and entirely your own reversing process, from scratch, then kudos to you, you deserve to charge money for it, otherwise you do NOT.

Not cool.

You should try to get a refund. If this doesn't help then maybe report this to police?

I just realized there is a resemblance between this tool and a tool named unarch tool. Does this tool's author have a connection with unarch tool's author?

Yeah, it is the same guy. He stole other people program's and put their code to his tool.
He confirmed it in Unarch's topic:

> The first tool that I released was containing some other people's tools and eventually, I deleted it from the web. Now I am releasing a similar tool with a similar game library.

Then he renamed tool to Criextract Tool and then he renamed it again to Unarch Tool.
Author claims that he removed other people code's from Unarch, but because it is paid and paid
version's source is closed, we can't really check it and confirm.

Althouh free version is available on github so you can review it.
