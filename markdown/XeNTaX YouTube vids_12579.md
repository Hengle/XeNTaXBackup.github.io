[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pxnfpa5kdQM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pxnfpa5kdQM) Here's my new video where I do a real-time analysis of Etherlords *.res files and then write a MexScript for MultiEx Commander, so it can extract resources from the game. Perhaps anyone can learn a thing or two, or at least watch me work for once.

That brings back memories. I mostly used DEU, and later WinDEU. I saved all my levels to 3.5" floppies back then, but they're long-lost after many moving trucks, along with most source code and maps for my early Duke3D/Quake/Half-Life mods.

Yeah, I know the feeling of such loss. In 1988 Mr.Ammo and I recorded stupid video clips of ourselves (aged 14) but well worth a good laugh, and those tapes got erased / lost. Would have loved to see those again now. Also, we did similar story telling using digitized voices on the c64, and yes, those damn 5 1/4 floppies got lost and/or corrupted. And then a back up of all kinds of mods, code and stuff I did on the PC between 1994 and 1997 got screwed over by a failing Iomega tape drive ripping a tape to bits.
