- Post Title: Stella Glow BCRES.cmp Model format

Hey Guys.

The game Stella Glow for 3DS appears to use standard 3DS BCRES models but they're encased in a strange container with a .cmp extension

The header looks like this in Hex Workshop, so I'm pretty sure thats compressed, I've never seen anything like that, at first I thought it was LZ compression but no tools I have seem to work on this.

I've uploaded some file cut samples here for anyone to take a look at: [https://www.dropbox.com/s/jmlsiqxxzqi87 ... g.zip?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/jmlsiqxxzqi87we/STELLAGLOW_chr_bg.zip?dl=0)

It'd be great if anyone else was interested in checking these files out.

Thanks guys.
