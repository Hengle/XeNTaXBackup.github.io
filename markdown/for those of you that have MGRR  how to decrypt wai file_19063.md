- Post Title: for those of you that have MGRR:  how to decrypt wai file?

i don't actually have the game installed on my PC (i just have the audio files left over), but does anyone know anything about the Wwise .wai file used in MGRR, along with other Wwise-supported games?  as far as i know the file has all of the music configuration (which im interested in), but can barely find any info about it.  

i'd provide the file if i could so sorry about that
