- Post Title: my sexy regina costume on RE3 psx

hi..using TIM2 VIEW i ripped the textures of original resident evil3 psx  and using the convert option from TIM to PNG i have modded  a sexy  Regina textures costume as you see in the picture. unfortunately reinjecting the textures in the image file of the game, with emulators on pc, both in EBOOT version on PSP, as soon as I insert this costume in the game, the game freezes.. while instead it works normally with the unmodified costumes.. too bad..

helping is not a duty but it can be an act of courtesy. in Italy we say that "the loaned bread is always returned"... a few words to the good connoisseur. anyway,  bro, thanks for your gently  kind attention
