- Post Title: Driver San francisco wwise adpcm?

Hi!
I tried to play with mplayer but sounds horrible, i know wwise can encode in wav, apdcm and vorbis.
Here is an example:

I wanted to extract the songs from this game recently - there's hardly any information about the music files on the internet. I've tried ww2ogg with different codebooks, aluigi's ffmpeg scanner and modifying the RIFF header, to no avail. However, after some searching I found a Wwise IMA ADPCM Tool designed for Payday games. With little hope, I tried loading in the files... and lo and behold, it works.
