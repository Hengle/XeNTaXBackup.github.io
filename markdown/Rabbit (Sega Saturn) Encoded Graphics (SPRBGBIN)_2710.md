- Post Title: Rabbit (Sega Saturn) Encoded Graphics? (SPR/BG/BIN)

A rather odd little fighting game for the Sega Saturn which has been a hard one for me to understand graphically for a good while now. I'm almost centered down on how it handles graphics but it's nothing like Playstation, confusing really.

This contains:

BG and BG2 which I assume is a double layered background.
SPR which is obviously saying "sprite"
And a BIN file which often tells how everything is assembled and contains palettes.

Now I don't know anything about decoding but I can't seem to find out how to view the graphics let alone convert them. Sound tends to be easier because all the music are tracks and the sounds are raw PCM. Any help appreciated. Sega Saturn's formats have been a pain.
