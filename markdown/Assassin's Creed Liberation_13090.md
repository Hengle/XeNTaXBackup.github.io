- Post Title: Assassin's Creed: Liberation

Hello all,

I would like to ask you something. I would like to do the Czech translation for Assassin's Creed: Liberation. And for this game is no script for exporting and importing files. Do you think that you would look at this game and let me know?

Thank You 
Jan Valu≈°ek
