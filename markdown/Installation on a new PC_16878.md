- Post Title: Installation on a new PC

Hello,

I recently built a new computer for myself, which I plan to use as my main machine. I would like to use MultiEx Commander on my new computer; is there a limit to the number of machines I can install it on at once? I would like to know before I try and install it, as I don't want to break any rules, or the program itself.

No, no limit.
