A lot of articles have been citing protein shakes as an effective way to lose weight and at the same time, enhance bodily functions. Yes, it's indeed an essential part of our system; however, what is stored in our body is not enough.

It is important to keep in mind that not all mixture of protein shakes fits everyone's nutritional needs. We have to know what The kitchen appliances reviews and guides blog. Several mixtures are offered in most supermarkets, such as Chocolate Whey and Vanilla Whey Shakes.

Do protein combos mixed as shakes fulfill the benefit of what good dietary shake purposely provide? Always remember that these shakes have varied uses, depending on the ratio and amount of protein, fats, and carbohydrates in the mixture. If you are an athlete, then a carbohydrate-rich protein shake is ideal for you. In making this particular dietary food-drink a meal replacement, you may consider the following ingredients:

1 banana (frozen and cut into pieces)
4-6 pieces of strawberries from a frozen strawberry package (or you can buy the ones still unpacked; just make sure they are frozen before using)
½ cup low-fat yogurt
1 cup orange or pineapple juice (you could also use lemon juice)
2 scoops Whey protein powder

Our body has stored protein, which does this work as one of its many specific roles in the digestion process. Here's how. To be able to digest and utilize protein, our body needs more energy or calories, unlike carbohydrates, which digest much faster. This scenario keeps up with the necessary process by increasing metabolism. Hence, more calories are used up to burn and more fat is lost. One protein-rich shake is the High Energy Shake, which may be considered with the following mixture:

10 oz pure water
10 strawberries (fresh or frozen)
1 tbsp flaxseed oil
½ tsp vanilla extract
1 heaping scoop of protein of choice (about 1 oz)
Stevia to taste (optional)
2-3 ice cubes (optional)


Basically, knowing what are the best and good protein shakes entails knowledge of your body and your body's needs. First, know your goal - whether to manage or lose weight or to build muscle and increase endurance. When you already know, then choose a protein shake that is right for you.
