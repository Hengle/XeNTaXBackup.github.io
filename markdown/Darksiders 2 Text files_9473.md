Does Anyone know which one can be language file?

can you list up the different extensions, or upload a file of each extension, of course not the dds files.

also, is it normal that the files have these weird names? or is it auto-generated using the extraction tool?

It's actually .loc files, they appear as .bod because of the way offzip extracts things and the way the data is stored in the .upak files.
