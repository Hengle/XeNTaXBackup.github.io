There already is another thread about EA Layer 3 in the audio section. Use the search function.
The most comprehensive site about EA formats I know is the multimedia wiki: [http://wiki.multimedia.cx/index.php?tit ... d_eXchange](http://wiki.multimedia.cx/index.php?title=Electronic_Arts_Sound_eXchange)
