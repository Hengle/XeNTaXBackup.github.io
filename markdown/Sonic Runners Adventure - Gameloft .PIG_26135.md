- Post Title: Sonic Runners Adventure - Gameloft .PIG

I've been trying to extract models from Sonic Runners Adventure and I have had no luck so far. It seems to use a newer version of the .pig format seen in Gameloft's other titles. If anyone could help me extract a few models from these files it would be much appreciated!
