- Post Title: two mgs2 requests: snake's hidef hands and ocelot

i'm sure if anyone has them, it's lionheartuk, though he hasn't posted in a while. i have a lot of catching up to do with the .evx progress made with solidus, even if the project is mostly dead now, so i haven't been able to get anything useable from any .evx.

there are probably non-evx tanker chapter ocelot definitions, but i can't find any. and maybe not because of the coat, though that could be purely additive, much like i think snake's hi-poly hands are. but anyway, that's what i'm looking for if anyone has them. tanker ocelot and some form of high def hands from the game, even if they're raiden's or ocelot's of solidus'. i would definitely appreciate it.
