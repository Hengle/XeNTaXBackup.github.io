I also have some sort of collection, mainly MMORPG client setup files after I realized that when a game closes, the setup files eventually are lost and then that's it. Still looking for lazeska client (though I haven't put any effort into searching).

However, it is not very practical.
I would like to set up a website or an online repository where people can upload samples.

Obviously, it would be a big target for anyone looking to kill some sites, but as long as it appears to be "research" and only hosts "useless" data (in terms of actually making something, so like rather than a full set of game models we have maybe parts of a model or something) it shouldn't become popular.

I  could create a sample repository forum. Data would still have to be hosted somewhere else if too big though. I could host or rehost sample files provided a few rules be followed (like no isos, less than 25 mb).

We can try some stuff and then see how it goes.
I'd like a system where users can upload their own files, and looking for arbitrary samples for arbitrary games would be pretty easy as well.

Host would be in Russia right? You could probably get away with a lot more than we can around here. Sounds like a plan...

Yea i think we can found host in rusia maybe i not shure wath its the free space in rusian free hosts, the other way its that, just now i working in home page to storage all games samples, but now i need a small aplication one can changue the Folders Names because this its how the companys found the files and delete the folders.
The rule to changue folders names its the next if the game name its
Martial Empires the new name in folder need be Lzqshzk Dlohqdr
This its 1 character before of the original name, numbers can be the same.
But i need a small aplication to do this, hope somebody can help with that.

LOL I think I would have trouble finding samples myself unless I install some browser plugin that automatically ROT's highlighted text. Or I train myself to automatically shift all letters over by some fixed amount.

How about just a thumbnail of the game hosted somewhere reliable?
Rather than using plain text (or encrypted text...)

cool it appears to show up right in my account o.O
Does that mean if someone deletes something, it's gone?

Or maybe there's a way to set up security so that people can't exactly delete stuff.

I think you shouldn't publicly advertise the repository, but instead, people will "PM you for samples" and then you'll give them the link, and then they'll know.

I spread the client of the game Azer Online. That no one was not looking for Google. It seems you can find it, but it's easier to download from here rather than search.
