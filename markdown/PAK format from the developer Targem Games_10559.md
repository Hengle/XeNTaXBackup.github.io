the tables are encrypted/obfuscated so I don't see an easy way to extract the content (which is not obfuscated)

I still use my script in Python 3, but there is an implementation in C from the author [learn_more](http://www.unknowncheats.me/forum/other-games/105455-star-conflict-pak-extractor.html).
I studied the texture format, meshes, UV, indexes of materials and partly format descriptions bones. And wrote for myself plugins for Blender to their imports.
P.S. I would not want that information which can be obtained from the resources of the game has damaged development of the game.
