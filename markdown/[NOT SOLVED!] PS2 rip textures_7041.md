I dont think that helps me, it crashes for me because I run it through 3dripper. If I'm missing something, can you please quote that part? Because I can't find what I need in the mile long engrish text.

Because I can't find what I need in the mile long engrish text.I ripped before other games and work fine, first of all, 3DRIPPER work with XP, because use DX9, second you get crash is because have something wrong in emulator, configure it same like say Rimbros.

I check the website and say don't support DX10 or 11 like W7 so don't know what do for make it work, ou get crash emulator is cause how say in web, you don't have full support to DX10 or 11 so try install XP in Virtual Machine and run there 3DRIPPER DX

basically, directx 10/11 is backward-campatible with directx 9. maybe you should do your own research, or at least not completely ignore my posts

it's not actually different. I have experience in game development, so I think I have a slight chance of knowing that. The fact that a program which uses DX9 runs on one OS but not on the other can be caused by numerious other issues. And it's not even the case here, Im saying yet again that Ive used 3d ripper with dolphin in both vista and 7 with no problem. Maybe you are only aware of the "Global monitoring" mode which really isnt available for the two.
