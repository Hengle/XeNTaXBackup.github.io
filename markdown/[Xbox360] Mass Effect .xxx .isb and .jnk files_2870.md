Did you check our GFFC?? It seems this is a known format there. Check Psychonaut Explorer.

Oh and .jnk probably stands for JUNK. The file is completely filled with 0's.

Pas de problÃ¨me 
Well don't know if this is correct, it's been 4 years since my last french lesson 

I already opened a topic about creating tutorials for the community to help people get into the process of figuring out file formats:
[viewtopic.php?t=2867](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?t=2867)

Also uploaded a rough draft of my first tutorial there.

> And i found the guide in pdf so i learn how this work but cant start with xbox files to much complicated  pretty guide by the way!
Yeah it's a good and comprehensive reference.

Oh    i'm sorry Mr Mouse i didnt take a look there before.
I used PsychonautsExplorer1.3 and its wav files only and i cant read the wav i installed the codec for it and still weird sound.
But anyway the 3D model arent there so i guess they are in the *.xxx files and dunno if you can look at it.
I have a ini files from the game with directory line so perhaps more easy for find the files in the *.xxx.
really hope you find a away for open them so i can finally mod.
Rheini ty a lot i'm gonna take a look    it's pretty hard to start with all the numbers and stuff but just really wnt to learn when i see what i can do next for mod games.

Has anyone tested it?

EDIT: Maybe [http://www.lzop.de](http://www.lzop.de) is appropriate for that.

I'm not sure that'll do the trick. The Gears of War thread has a decompressor attached in there... I have not tried it but that would be more suitable.

I used some existing code in a project to test it,

Based on the .xxx file provided above from data at
0x1EB0D
Based on syntax above:
file size = 34901 bytes
Decompressed size = 65536 bytes

So input = data from 0x1EB0D to 0x27362
and after decompression output = 65536 bytes

Works for me,
cheers

Wow nice job Ty for taking a look a it.
I understand only 30% of what was said.. i still learn how to look into a file etc..
Do you think it's possible to make an extractor/replace file ? like the other file from the unreal engine its encrypted    just hope one of you find a way for get the file inside.
Thanks again

Hi all   
I'm still trying to find how to extract and too much complicated for me i think    i'm learning slowly how to check file format and what is inside etc..
Did someone found a way for extract and replace the files ? or if some one already made an extractor for *.xxx files of Gear of war so perhaps can work with this one.
Thanks for the one who take a look already i wish i can mod the game soon .. long time i wait for do this.

Mass Effect is based on Unreal 3 engine.
Though, extraction of data can be done, you cant replace it, because *.xxx files are signed with SHA-1 shecksum, and checksums are situated in default.xex file.
As we all know, .xex files can not be modified right now.

Correct me if im wrong, but SHA1 doesent use any type of keys. So we could simply decompile the .xex in IDA and find the algorithim. Then we could simply recalculate it via an app.

After we recalculate them, wee need to patch default.xex because checksums table is situated in default.xex
That is not possible

yes sha1 is only a simple hash algorithm and can be recalclulated if something is patched. but if they check this hash value, you can make it.

how do you extract from xx files, not really interested in recompiling the files. Is there an extractor built which can do this?

The problem about UT3 xxx files is generally that they are very variable. Nearly every Ut3 Engine game has a other size for the Header and the header i also very variable. Anyway what did you want to extract plodtrew?
