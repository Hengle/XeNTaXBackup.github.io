- Post Title: Urban Chaos - Issues with compiling the source code

Do anyone was able to compile source code from this repository?
[https://github.com/dizzy2003/MuckyFoot-UrbanChaos](https://github.com/dizzy2003/MuckyFoot-UrbanChaos)
The code is very old and it seems that there are many compatibility issues.
I would need some instructions how to properly set environment, which versions of VS and SDKs should I install etc. to make this work.

Also is there any ongoing work with rewriting this code to newer platforms/software?
It would be nice to be able compile it for example in Visual Studio 2019 on Windows 7 or Windows 10.
