Sorry Zench, these were test forums. The plan is to have these threads created automatically from a new site were are working on that will enable forum members to upload their tools. I ask you for your patience until that site is completed.

Yeah, I know. It was supposed to be like that. But due to internal issues we won't have that tools page soon. But it's still a good idea to have a separate tool only forum, so I just opened these up. Sorry about the confusion.
