- Post Title: *.pigg - City of Heroes

hi,

i got the closed beta client of city of heroes. [http://www.cityofheroes.com](http://www.cityofheroes.com) if you dont know it ^^
All files are compressed in files called *.pigg . now i wanna ask you if anyone can make a extractor or include it in any extractor that i can unpack that files. i dont think its a difficult compression but im not a coder :/

I would be VERY pleased if anyone can help me. I uploaded 2 small .pigg files from my city of heroes client that you guys can try. You can find it here:

[http://www.arandar.de/coh_pigg/](http://www.arandar.de/coh_pigg/)

If you need any other pigg file or want me to help in any way contact me: email [Gins@gmx.net](mailto:Gins@gmx.net) or ICQ #117493533

THANKS

Ok, I have figured enough out of these files to enable extraction using a MultiEx Commander (Mex3Scriptor) script. 

The problem is that it is not executable by the current release of MultiEx Commander, basically because there's a bug in the release version of multiex.dll when it processes the CLog command. 

Succesful execution of the script on these files can only be achieved by installing a new MultiEx Commander executable mc32.exe and a fixed multiex.dll in the Windows system32 directory. I will see if i can post a fix. 

You can view the script at :

Watch these pages for a fix. Note that this fix is going to be an unofficial fix.

Ah yes, well, when I replaced some files to test the import function, I noticed I got an error as well. But this is due to the compressor/uncompressor. I had forgotten to first compress it, prior to importation. 

So, if you want to import anything, you will first have to compress it using zlib. 

Hmm, this might be a bit problematic I think, because you must be left with a zlib-compressed data file, not a zlib archive. 

I probably should have included an option to precompress files if the user asks for it. Much easier.  

Anyway, it may be that the errors you get are due to the fact that the files that give the error are not compressed. MultiEx Commander will try to decompress them, this will fail, and voila, an error.

I'm not sure wether the files extracted are standalone DDS files, or still packed texture files with DDS files in them.

I have had trouble extracting the sound files from the .pigg files. You have any luck on them? Also, any progress on the .texture files?

Thanks

The .texture files are just .dds files with some proprietary header junk at the beginning. Simply open the .texture file in any hex editor and delete everything before the first "DDS" (without quotes, and all capital).

If you did it right, the first 3 characters of your file should be DDS.

Save the file as *.dds and open in Photoshop or PSP using the dds plugin.

Also, Samsung,
You cannot extract the sound files when MultiEx thinks their compressed size is 0. Unfortunately, this seems to cover all but a few sounds.
