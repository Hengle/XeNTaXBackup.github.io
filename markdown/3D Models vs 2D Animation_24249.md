- Post Title: 3D Models vs 2D Animation?

Hey, Trying to settle a debate with my friends on this.

If you had to choose one game art style for all 'mobile' games to be converted to which would you choose? and Why?

3D models (Ex. Genshin) or 2D animations (Ex. AFKarena).[showbox](https://showbox.tools/) [speed test](https://speedtest.vet/)
