Hello everyone

I'm newbie for this way (Extracting model from game)
First, I would like to tell you about the game that I want to extract model

After that, I already got .dat file from .npk but I cannot extract it
I try to use Hex2ojb but I got error 2 messages 
- wordpad.exe is missing
- glut32.dll not found

Please, help me

Sorry for my Poor English
