- Post Title: [Request] The Last of Us Remastered Eboot.bin

Does anybody with a decrypted backup of TLOU on ps4 have the ability to share the eboot.bin. I have been doing a bit of research into how the last of us loads on ps4 and this is the main file that I need. If anybody can share it I would be extremely appreciative. Thanks
