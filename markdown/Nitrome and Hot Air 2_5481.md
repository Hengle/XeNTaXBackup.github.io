- Post Title: Nitrome and Hot Air 2

[http://www.nitrome.com/games/hotair2/](http://www.nitrome.com/games/hotair2/)

This is another sad sequence of flash files that I can't seem to manually locate. I personally have beaten the game fully but I can't seem to find the actual LEVEL Swf files. I was hoping I'd be able to put together an offline version of the game but it uses mochi methods for it's levels and unfortunately that is too much for me. Beating this game happened on another computer though that I no longer have access to, so I was hoping someone could play through the game fully with Tamper Data and pick up the levels SWFs so I can put together an offline version for myself and others.
Can anyone help?
