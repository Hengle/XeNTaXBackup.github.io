- Post Title: the quickbms only export .dat files

when I was using quick bms to extract models and textures he exported to .dat files.I was trying to extract the game "Up (video game)" with the script of the game Ratatouille (PC), the extension of the files are .DPC (those that turned .dat). Someone knows how to help me, if you know please tell me how to solve this.
