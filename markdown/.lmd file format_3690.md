- Post Title: .lmd file format

Hello everyone I'm new at understanding file formats. So I thought of understanding the formats of a 3d fighting game that I like.
The extension is .lmd and I think that it holds information about the 3d character models. So far I extracted some .dds files from it using a normal game archive scanner/extractor.
So I think its safe to say that the format is not packed or encrypted in any way.

Any help would be appreciated. 

Here is a link to 5 of these files:

P.S. The game has other formats like .stg2/cpu0/ffso/glo/lmtp/fsp/col/trc ... maybe you guys can help me with these other formats too.
