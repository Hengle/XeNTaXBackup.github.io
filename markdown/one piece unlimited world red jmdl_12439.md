you could try it using hex2obj (view link in my sig)
But you might have hard times eliminating superfluous faces.  

Though my 15 minutes had expired I gave it a 2nd (and last) try:

I could upload a 'cleaned up' hands_and_dagger obj file, if you wished.

if the files are not too big you can use the neptunia extractor.
if they are big just do this.

Hi
Here is unpacker and importer for models from this game.
It requires Blender version 249 and Python 2.6.
How use:
1.unpack importer.
2.use CriToolpack.exe  on rom0.cpk  (tool made by [viewtopic.php?p=87026#p87026](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?p=87026#p87026) )
3.in Blender Text Window press alt+p and select:
-  one unpacked file like "FILE_00658" and wait until this all type files will be too unpacked.
- go to folder "char/unpack" and select jmdl for import textured and rigged meshes

Small update: fix rotMatrix for bones (convert radians to degrees)

How does critoolpack work? I can't batch export the files for some reason, only single files, and i cant really do that for over 5000 files.
Thank you szkaradek for the import script though!

hmm.. 

Does Know Anyone How To unpack *.Cri File , Should Not Work With critoolpack to rip rom1.cpk And rom2.cpk. Well I Think The DLC Cloth, Enemies And Monster In rom1.cpk Or rom2.cpk.

I Use [http://aluigi.altervista.org/papers/bms/cpk.bms](http://aluigi.altervista.org/papers/bms/cpk.bms) to Unpack rom1.cpk And rom2.cpk and get Cri Compresses .

Thank you so much for this, it works great! However, like lumekano, I was wondering if there was any way to unpack rom1.cpk and rom2.cpk for more content as well.

Again, thank you for your continued work and effort!

Any possibility to support environments? I'm not sure if the following file is an environment or not (could just be the ship) but baratie.jmdl doesn't load within the script, it causes an error. angelbeach.jmdl (which seems to be named as an environment) doesn't load and gives the same error.

Hi, I'm a necroposter.
I'm mainly from Dragon Ball, the only reason why I'm here is because I'm trying to extract Dragon Ball Fusions models which are just a little-endian version of Unlimited World Red's jmdl format.
For line 242, however, instead of "print file" or "print filename" it should be "print(file)" or whatever it was in the script.
There was another line that had this same error, and it has the same solution.
However, Blender decided to scrap its old Python API and all hope of using old scripts, so just doing "import Blender" causes an error as Blender's trying to "go towards a new direction"
