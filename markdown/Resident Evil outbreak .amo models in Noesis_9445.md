Well you did a good job on that. I was wondering... you're starting this topic for showoff or maybe for the plug in /script release?

I always make a thread, post up pictures, and then show-off.

But I don't call it showing off; I call it gathering interest  

He's got full animation loaded though, which is better than the kind of stuff I do LOL
