Which one did you use?
And: yes, it takes some time to learn it. I tried blender's Gus tutorial long ago.
(If I remember exactly there's nothing not to cope with.  )

For 3dsmax there is this: [http://www.polygonblog.com/character-rigging/](http://www.polygonblog.com/character-rigging/)
Didn't test it but maybe you could step in at step 5 (better make the complete tut if you have max.)

Btw your cooler's tail is looking a little bit strange...
