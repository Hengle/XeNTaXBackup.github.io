I don't have that game, could you post a copy of the file.

If the file is too big, the pieces of the file we would need are...
1. the first 50000 bytes
2. The last 50000 bytes

If you can cut these parts of the file out and attach the 2 pieces to the boards here, we can take a look at them.


Thanks mate,

Hi again,

I took a look at the 2 files, and although I can identify the contents in the file, I cannot see any type of directory or other helpful information. It is therefore possible that there is a separate directory file.

Is there another file with the same name, which is much smaller. For example, if this file is called VoiceFE.rws, there might be another directory file called, for example, VoiceFE.dir. If there is another file with the same name, which is also relatively small (probably less than 100kb) then we would like to take a look at it.

Sorry for not being able to help so far.
