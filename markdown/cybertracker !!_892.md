- Post Title: cybertracker !!

hi Ã¬ found out about cybertracker a few days ago 
and i really like it
but i have a problem 
i want to make mp3 from my music and i can`t find a way to render it 
cybertracker works fine in vice but there is no way to render the song
i tried it in ccs64 (a very nice emu) but the keys are wrong in the tracker
and i can`t work with it 
i also need it becource i want to make a vsti plugin (made with synthedit)
i need the sine triangle saw and pulse waves on a very low (c-0)
hope someone can help me with this and i hope it`s the good forum 
you can mail me at [odosynths@yahoo.com](mailto:odosynths@yahoo.com)

Why don't you just record the WAVE output of your sound card?

1. 
- Go to Volume Settings in Accessories. 
- select Options and then Record
- Make sure you have checked WAVE as well
- Click Ok and select WAVE output to record
- Set the record level of the WAVE output to highest

2. 
Start any program that will record the sound for you (like Cool Edit, or even the stupid Windows Recorder)

3. Start VICE. Set the program in 2. to RECORD and then play your music

4. When the tune is done, stop the program in 2. and save the WAVE file

5. Get [http://www.lorenzini.com/jlorenzi/encoder.exe](http://www.lorenzini.com/jlorenzi/encoder.exe) An easy to  use and free MP3 encoder, select "ADD FILES", choose your wav and hit "Encode". 

VOILA. 

Here's an example: The Boulderdash tune, played by VICE.
