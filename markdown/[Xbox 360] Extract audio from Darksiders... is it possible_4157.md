- Post Title: [Xbox 360] Extract audio from Darksiders... is it possible?

I've been playing this amazing game for a couple of days now and it struck me how superb the voice acting and effects are. If possible, i would love to extract these so i can save them on my computer, but i'm not sure how to get them from the ISO or 360 DVD -- can it be done? Thanks!
