Greetings,is this a possible to extract textures from igb files? 
On Zenhax thread ([http://zenhax.com/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=4410](http://zenhax.com/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=4410)) about wii igb someone said what textures are in BTI format. 
Only one man at Marvelmods (this is a popular site about MUA modding) figured out how to extract textures out these files,but he hasn't been active over 5 years. 
Texture finder can see texture inside igb but they are doesn't looks properly
