I'm searching people who give me help for unpacking Dungeon Fighter Online's 'Script.

Hello. I'm a user and I am researching other country's Dungeon Fighter Online.

I got Dungeon Fighter Online's 'Script.pvf made at 2013 (Korea) but I couldn't unpack it in my ability.

I wish to see contents in the Script.pvf. Please help me unpack it.
