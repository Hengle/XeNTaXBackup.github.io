- Post Title: .RWM files in Robot Wars Extreme Destruction

Hi all,

Recently I have been looking into the files of robot wars extreme destruction and I came across some .rwm files in there. I was wondering if anyone out there may be able to have a look at opening these up to see what is inside. I have linked a few below.

"No Strips" is the better choice here.
(But the basic problems remains. Might be a matter of indexed indices.)
