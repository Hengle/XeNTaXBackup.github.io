- Post Title: Resident Evil 8 Vilage Extract Model

Who knows how to pull out models with "Re Engine"? I've been digging through the files of 8 resident evil for a long time and I just can't figure out where the Blend Shapes of face animations are. So that you can throw, for example, into a blender and use them like Key Shapes. Does anyone know how to do this?
