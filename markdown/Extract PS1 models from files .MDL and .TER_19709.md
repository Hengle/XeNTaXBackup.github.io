- Post Title: Extract PS1 models from files .MDL and .TER

Hi.

I want to extract the models and terrains of a PS1 game, Muppet Racemania. In the ISO there are individual files for each model. Characters are in folders called "CHARS", and each have two files with extensions .ANM and .MDL. Terrains are in folders called "COURSE", and each have three files with extensions .DAT, .RAW, .TER. 
Is there any method to extract the models from these files?

I have noticed that the game "Toy Story Racer" has the same structure of files and folders. Both games are from the same developer, Traveller Tales.

I attach here 5 example files: 2 from a character and 3 from a terrain.
