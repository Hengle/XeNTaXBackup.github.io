- Post Title: RAGE .patch files extract

I guess RAGE's gameresources_sp_01.patch file includes dialogs. Is there any extract tool for this extension?
If it does not exist, someone can make it?

I uploaded the file: [https://1drv.ms/u/s!As1YIsG1noSqgjtz2HNl1wYxEdzp](https://1drv.ms/u/s!As1YIsG1noSqgjtz2HNl1wYxEdzp)
