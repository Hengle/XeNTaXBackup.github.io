You should try to use OmegaT [http://www.omegat.org/en/dl_overview.php](http://www.omegat.org/en/dl_overview.php)
Just change the extension from INT to INI and load files to new project.

As I said, you can edit INT files in OmegaT and that's very easy. You don't need to use other tools...

There is no generic magic solution, INT files dosn't have a default format for all Unreal 3 games.
What is there so hard in translating INT file texts? I dont see that.
