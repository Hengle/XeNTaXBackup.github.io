Ok, so I took a look. 

there are three 256*256 tiles that contain individual graphics. The ARENA.DAT file starts with a header and at 1e0h starts the image data for those three tiles. The data are 8-bit bitmaps. In the following picture you see what you get if you load everything at once (without the header). At the back of the file is other type of data, perhaps graphics of different size, or palette info?

OK, so can you save the palette? And upload it here? Did you simply compare colours from screenshots?

i go close to the possible colors, you know.. skin colours, cloth etc. than i go slowly 


in the image, some object has a palette and some another one.
here is shao kahn palette:


in that files the BG color (top left corner) seems to be always black, so that speed a little up the search. and also the previous colour to that black one sometimes is a red or a green one.
most of the time the palettes of the different objects are one after one.
sorry for my limited english
