If you want to rip models from an Xbox game you don't need ninja ripper at least it depends if you use an emulator or not to run your game, it never worked in my case (PCSx2 / BlueStack) but you can still try i guess i might be wrong...
And also you need to unpack the iso and see what's inside look at the archives and search if their is some unpackers somewhere on the internet for exemple you can't rip tekken 4 / 5 models directly from the ISO of these PS2 games... because the data is packed / crypted and nobody did something for it yet ! it might be the case for the game you want to rip also but their is maybe some other things that can do the trick idk just google it.
I think the only way for you to do it is to get sample files from the ISO like the potential model / textures file formats once done you will need to write a noesis script in python to import the mesh / textures (it's difficult even for me) but to do this you need to be able to "analyze" a file format telling where is the start address of the vertex buffer his "count" same for faces and bla bla and tons of other stuffs.
I think you should post some samples here that people could "guide you" in your goal.
Good luck ! 

ps : tell us what the game is
