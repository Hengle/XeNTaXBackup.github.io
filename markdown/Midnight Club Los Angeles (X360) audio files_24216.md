- Post Title: Midnight Club Los Angeles (X360) audio files

Hi there,

I am trying to convert the audio files of Midnight Club Los Angeles Xbox 360 version to wav.
Since OpenIV does not support MCLA, I extracted the single files from the rpf archive using Twisted89's RPFTool:
[https://mega.nz/folder/e1QWUBZQ#OY37iI2wRwfio9_UmcVhZg](https://mega.nz/folder/e1QWUBZQ#OY37iI2wRwfio9_UmcVhZg)

However, that tool does not give you the ability to extract to wav as OpenIV does.
So the files do not seem to have any specific format and seem to be encrypted (or possibly are even containers similar to .awc?). I do not know how to proceed from here.
I uploaded two of those audio files, see here:

I tried messing around with SparkIV and OpenIV to somehow apply the "Export to .wav" function to these files but obviously that wouldn't work.

Any help is greatly appreciated!
