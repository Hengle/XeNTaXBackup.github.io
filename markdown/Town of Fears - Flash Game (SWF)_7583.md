What does "decompiler didn't help" mean?

Which one did you use?
Couldn't they decompile anything?
Was the code obfuscated (unreadable for a human)?
Diving into it without this info makes it a bit hard

This is Localization sub-forum and it simply means that u won't be able to get strings used by game to display in-game texts from decompilers! At least, with Sothink's decompiler.

Or may be u've any idea?   

Then u're welcome!
