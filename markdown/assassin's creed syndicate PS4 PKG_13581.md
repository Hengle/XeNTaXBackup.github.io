- Post Title: assassin's creed syndicate PS4 PKG

I downloaded the PS4 iso file from private torrent tracker
after mounted the iso it appears that all game files are stored inside one big .PKG "app.pkg" 39.9GB
this format is different from what common PS3 games had, 
I tried to use this tool 
[https://ps3gamelist.wordpress.com/2015/ ... list-v3-4/](https://ps3gamelist.wordpress.com/2015/11/22/ps3-game-list-v3-4/)
but no luck, only 9 mb extracted 

sadly i cannot upload this huge file, i hope someone experience with ps4 PKG files could help me

I want to take arabic localization files from PS4 version and import it on steam version somehow, "pc version officially doesn't had arabic localization "

Those tools do not unpack PS4 PKG files.

it only extracts unencrypted data which is like a few icon files nothing else.
