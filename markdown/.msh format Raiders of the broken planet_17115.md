- Post Title: .msh format Raiders of the broken planet

Anyone able to help?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Any chance of getting some help on converting the .msh files from this game?

Sample file at:

[https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BxHUo ... 1RZM0RCc2s](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BxHUotWqZsiRQzBfM1RZM0RCc2s)

I have tries couple of scripts associated with .msh format for other games but no luck with this game.

Cheers

I have modified and released the 3D Object Converter v6.520 as a web update.

How to get the 3D Object Converter v6.520:
Please download the 3D Object Converter from [http://3doc.i3dconverter.com](http://3doc.i3dconverter.com) and install it
or download the portable version and extract it into a folder.

Run the program and use the Help/check for updates function to get it.

I will release the updated i3DConverter for Mac and Linux versions later.

Use the correct extract script to extract the Raiders of the Broken Planet archives:

This game is developed by MercuryStream. So it will use their Mercury Engine.
I would try to open them with Castelavania LoS 2 maxscript found [Here](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=11146&hilit=castlevania&start=16).
You will also need .sm3 file first to load .msh.

This script will not work unfortunatelly, I've had a brief look at this game format, files looks like compiled or smt, maybe they were just not properly extracted. I've got samples from other person, don't have the game myself.

Prologue is free on steam, however I don't like their episodic content. 35 bucks for single mission? gtfo.
However, 
1.) file is badly extracted I assume, since it's compressed/encrypted.
2.) file is compressed/encrypted inside (after header)
either way I did not had time to research it.
