- Post Title: Assassin's Creed .pck/.wwise files

I'm trying to get voice audio from Assassin's Creed Black Flag. I know it's possible, tons of people have done it before, but all links to tool packs are dead by now.

I've tried manually figuring it out with a combination of Ravioli, ww2ogg, and lots of various quickbms scripts, but I just can't seem to get any playable files.

Anyone know the exact order of operations and what specific scripts or tools to use?
