- Post Title: (Arcade) Silent Hill's noisy protagonists... (.pcm files)

Hi there,
I've been looking through silent hill arcade's files again and wondered if audio is as simple as it's models and textures.
Textures are in .dds format and 3d models use directx .x
Find everything here:

Here is a sample of a .pcm file:

Those .pcm files play as-is in Foobar - they are standard RIFF/WAVE files.  That particular one is some sort of scream sound effect.

Am I using the wrong version?
When I open or add files as they are, i get this error:


Thanks for helping, though!

Ah, I think it plays wit hthe .pcm extension only if you have vgmstream installed.

Instead, just rename the file to *.wav and it will play correctly.
