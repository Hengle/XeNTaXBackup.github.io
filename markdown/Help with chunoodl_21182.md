Hi friends, I've extracted recently FIFA 20 Nintendo switch and got chunoodl. compressed files. Is there anybody who can help me with this? Thanks
Here is the sample:

Here's the FIFA RX3Unpacker compatible with chunzstd, chunkzip and chunoodl.
The decompressed data will be save into a corresponding rx3l file as well in case you want to check if anything goes wrong.
