- Post Title: Skate 4 need help with .cas files

I've tried the frostbite scripts stuff, I've tried like every .cas extractor/dumper i can find and idk what else i can do. The only thing I can think of is making my own custom sdk profile for frosty editor but that would be extremely hard. sorry if this is the wrong place for this but I'm not sure where else i could go for help
