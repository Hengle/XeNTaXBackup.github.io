- Post Title: Detroit: Become Human sound files

Hello everyone,

I've been wondering if anyone has managed to rip the audio files from Detroit: Become Human?
This game has an insane amount of unreleased tracks and alternative versions of music. Does anyone happen to know more about it? 

Are there any tools for it? If so, how does it work? Or have the game files already been ripped?

So far only characters can be extracted/converted, the game files do not have an actual tool for individual assets extraction such as raw files as they are from main archives, so that other reverse people can take a look at them.

That's sad.    Detroit has so many unreleased tracks or variations of different tracks and I was hoping that the tool would also extract the sound files. I really hope that someday we will be able to do that.
