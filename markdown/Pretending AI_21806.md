In the past few months or so I made a robot that automated content creation for video games engines with focus on dialogue/quests. The current prototype uses a static source repository from Bioware.

After some abracadabra, the robot successfully and automatically created content for two different engines, so far.

At its lowest level what the robot does is file format conversion between engines.
