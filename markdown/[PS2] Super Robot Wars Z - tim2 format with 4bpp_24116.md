- Post Title: [PS2] Super Robot Wars Z - tim2 format with 4bpp

I found some posts on the forums, but I couldn't solve the problem, so I asked for help.

I can't open the 4bpp file unswizzledly among the options in tm2.

The problem is, some 4bpp files open well.

I'll put up two files here. One is visible, and the other is invisible.

Maybe we should solve the swizzle problem, but I don't know the details.

Would it be possible to get some help?

I've tried to open your sample file in multiple programs for TIM2 files and none of them was able to view it properly.
What game is it from?
