I thought it'd be an easy problem with an overly aggressive .htaccess, but the file isn't there so it's going to take a while to find the problem. Thanks for the report.

This is really weird. What browser do you use? Do you have an agent spoofer? A local proxy? Does it work in IE? Firefox?

It makes sense now. Looks like one of the IPs you use was banned for spamming the Wiki. That's the "you're blocked" screen you're seeing.

You're probably on dialup or some other dynamic IP deal, and a spammer got assigned one of the IPs you use. It will probably work again when your IP changes. If not, PM me the IP and I'll unban it.
