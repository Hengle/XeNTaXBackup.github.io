4XM video artifacts are a known problem with libavcodec (FFmpeg)

What does that have to do with my question? I need a 4xm demuxer so that I can play the audio files... Throw one of the samples into VLC and you'll hear that the audio is clear. You can even decode the files with VLC. However the demuxed RAW material isn't playable in vgmstream - that's what I was asking about...
