I tried offzip it just now with options -A and -a, how ever it only extracts A LOT of .dat files named like:
011d4800.dat
011d5000.dat
011d5800.dat

Some please point me to the right direction!

Sorry for sounding like a noob, but how exactly do I decompress/ convert those extracted files to the normal format they should be? Can you explain it a little bit more detailed, please?
never used that offzip and barely ever do any archive research due to the fact that I'm a games programmer, modeller and animator

Hm, wouldn't it be easier if someone just wrote a quickbms script to extract all the assets from this archive? lol

zlib doesnt store filenames and other info, its just a raw data stream.

I don't have the game installed anymore but the common packed archives could be opened simply with Winrar (Or similar.) unfortunately those might have been common .pak files and not these .rpack archives, I don't fully remember.
(Only opened the main data pack archive to enable debug mode a bit to overcome a brief section of the game towards the end sequence.)

Nope, these .rpack archives don't open with winrar or 7zip
that's the first thing I tried doing after I installed the game

simple answer to how do you extract assests: You need to determine what the raw data is, then figure out how to parse it into a usable file. its near impossible in certain propriety file type scenarios.

Indeed. For whatever reason even 3DRipper crashes on this game. So no love for the models/textures from this one..

I'm still having a bit of trouble getting the Sniper-Ghost Warrior assets to show up in chrome 4 editor. I know it's just a matter of what folder to put stuff in (and what stuff, the rpacks or the PAK's) If anyone here has successfully got the sniper assets to show up in the editor can you post your file paths and what file extensions go where?

And a bit of a bummer the editors exporter tool wont work on characters, but at least we can extract objects and what not. (so far only from the COJ game itself)

EDIT. This does not work. It appears you have to have the .msh files from the game (sniper) for COJ chrome4 editor to see them. And we dont have access to the .msh files....
