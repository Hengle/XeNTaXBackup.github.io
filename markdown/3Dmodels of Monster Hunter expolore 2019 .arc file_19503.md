Is this some sort of prank? You bumped your thread twice in under two hours... there’s a script for model importing MHXR found in this very forum and a decryption and unpacking tool for the arc files is also available publicly on the internet... do some research

I've used almost every tool on the internet. The forum's MHXR is a ios system, and it's 2015.Not available for Android's MHXR in 2019. I tried it too. It won't work

He wants to extract the models though, not play the game.

this is also something i've been trying to figure out, (partially due to extracting the .arc files themselves) though i wonder if the MT_Framework script is compatible with the .mods? though i feel that isn't the case
