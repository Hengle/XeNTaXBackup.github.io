- Post Title: Problem extracting PS2 save icons

There are a few ways to extract save icons from PS2 games, but converting them to a usable format usually involves either the MilkShape 3D plugin or PS2 IconSys Library & Tools. However, I've come across a game where I can't do this: Sonic RIders. I've extracted both the save icon and ghost data icon from my own files, and tried downloading save files that I found online then extracted from those. but the resulting file always causes MilkShape 3D to crash, and the other program does absolutely nothing with them. Why is this? What about this specific game does this? I've included a ZIP with both icons inside attached.

Alternatively, I could try to extract the icon files from the file SLUS_213.31. ...I have absolutely no idea how to do that, but opening it up in HxD shows both icon files exist within it.
