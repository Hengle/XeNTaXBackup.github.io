- Post Title: Pikmin 4 .wem

I'm trying to convert the .wem files from the Pikmin 4 demo to a listenable audio format, but I can't figure out how. One tool I found made wav files but those files were just blank. Can anyone help?
Heres a sample file: [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hBMVZ7 ... sp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hBMVZ7uemcQVGZSjSzVctUy0-DXP6VPe/view?usp=sharing)

That sample file plays fine in Foobar with vgmstream.  You can convert to .wav or other formats from there.
