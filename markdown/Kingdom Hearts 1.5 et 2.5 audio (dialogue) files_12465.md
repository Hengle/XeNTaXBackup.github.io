Has someone managed to extract KH 1.5 and 2.5 dialogues? I'd love to get my hands on them

ReCoM has no dialogue files as the cutscenes are recoreded, but you can get the battle quotes. they are stored in .rnd and .rnd (why both) but as in 1.5 almost every file is twice the 'hd' sound is in _rnd and _rsd files. you can rename these file to .mp3 

the dialogue sound of kh2 is easier to get if you have the file path  all should have the extension .scd you can rename these to .mp3 too.

for bbs it should be similar but I dont know the filenames. yet.

battle quotes would be better than nothing, but I am sure I do not know how to extract any sound from any version of 1.5 and 2.5...

if you can extract the files from the mself then you just need to rename the files. thats it

Can anyone rip the Battle quotes of Ventus and Terra from KH2.5's BBSHD? I've been asking around but nobody replied to me.

When you are sucessful, would you be able to provide us with a download link to the cutscene dialogue? If not submit them to the Sounds Resource?

I was not, about this. I could get some audio at least off the BBS iso, but it's really bad in quality I fear.

But still, can you at least give us a download link to the sound you ripped? I already have the cutscene dialogue from the first game on my archive.org account.

Please remind me of doing so next week, Tuesday afternoon. Send me a PM and remind me of this thread.

Which game are we talking about?
