- Post Title: 3d Models, animation importer - FatImporter

Import
You CAN NOT RE-DISTRIBUTE the program!
   - if you are not getting it from Xentax or my Chinese Game Research forum. Someone had already beach my rule!
NOT for BUSINESS and/or RESALE EVERYTHING imported by this!
   - sticky personal use only.
   - Don't sale any models/animations which is using FatImport in any process of your product!
NO HACKING into my maxscript!
   - most format are already in my Chinese Game Research forum. You don't have to hack into my maxscript to know that.
   - I am not a teacher, so don't ask me to teach you how to do this! Or correct your maxscript.
   - Don't even copy any part of my maxscript into your program! I have a little protection in my script this time, if you spend time in finding the right thing in there. Learn it from the maxscript help file! 

*Beach my rules will cause FatImport disappear! You have been wanted!



What is FatImporter?
FatImporter is a script-set which run under  3D Studio Max  to import some games 3D models!
It is more likely my personal showcase of my maxscript skills, project planning and GUI design. 



Why using FatImporter?
Because  3D Studio Max  is a powerful 3D modelling and animation program, so you can import the models and view , edit, rendering them on-the-fly!

Although there are many other people writing similiar script already, FatImporter use one simple GUI for user to import/view models! User will not have to border/organize their scripts anymore. Just Select the game from the drop-down list and press the button will do.

Same animation only have to import once, every imported animation stay in 3DSMAX and user can use the build-in animation viewer to select different animation again.

If the texture needed to be convert, they will be converted during the import process, as long as the texture files are in the right place!(Usually same folder as the models)



What games does it supported?
Right now, there are only 10 games fully supported. They are:
- Hinokakera Chaotic Eclipse (Japanese)
- Ikki Tousen : Shinning Dragon 一騎当千 (PS2)
- Kimi ga Yobu, Megiddo no Oka de 君が呼ぶ、メギドの丘で (Japanese)
- Magna Carta: The Phantom Of Avalanche
- Tales of the World: Radiant Mythology 2 (PSP)
- Tantra Online (MMO)
- The Settlers: Rise Of Cultures
- Torchlight
- Travia Online (MMO)
- Valkyrie Sky (MMO)

*The choice of games are base on the file format I am interested! Like Chunk based structure, OOP Objects, Vertices transformation etc.



Will it support more games?
Should be. I had planed to add 5 games every season! Hopefully, on next Christmas FatImpoter will support up to 30 games.

You have to extract the rar into your ..\3DSMAX XXX\Scripts folder, NOT stdplugs folder .

Check if  2012_Season1.cfg  is in your  .\3dsmax xxx\Scripts\FatImporter\ folder? 
Every files need to be in particular folder( .\3dsmax xxx\Scripts\FatImporter\ )

Your folder should look like this:

Models are imported with bones?

By the way when I try to load DMC3 models I get an error that says "unable to convert"

EDIT: I re-extracted the models with the bms and now it works but silly me.. it's just a beta

- Post Title: Re: 3d Models, animation importer - FatImporter

Hey FatDuck I am making a Doax2 similar game which will be much better than the original, the game has already started and is already going VERY Well - Eventually I will release a public beta but I need more animations - since DOAX girls will be in this game FULLY PLAYABLE and Upgraded Visually I would like you to help me extract the doa paradise animations since you said your tool will support those animations - so I simply want the animations to import into Max preferably to be savable as a .bip or simply in a way which I can have the animations running in max - I will seek a way to convert into .bip if need be since the animations might be designed for the default bones. I have already successfully extracted the doa models , made renders, and have had em running in the engine before with full camera control, animations of mine and clothes etc even shoes - My goal is to be able to make a game in which all those fans of girls can play with any female from any game - I simply need the required characters models and textures and I can convert into the engine but as said earlier animations are a must - those from doa paradise contain bone data rather than advanced morph or so on. No models from the game are needed - Simply the animations which I will then place onto the numerous girls I have awaiting - so far I already have a demo of the game but I will only release the demo when the correct level of desired progress is made. 

The girl I have which is my own is amazingly adaptive and beautiful and looks well fitting. So I need your help - Imagine having racheal from ninja gaiden or chun li from Street fighter 4 or whatever character - even Sexy beach girls in this game performing whatever animations are available all in real time at the click of a button and with full camera, clothes, and so on - also eventually with true mini games such as Water Polo, Pool, POKER WHERE YOU CAN ACTUALLY SEE ALL THE GIRLS performing the neccessary actions, roulette and so on - even go kart racing - whatever fancies can be accomplished - but of course we all know the gravure modes are our fancy and I know doa paradise has the most complete animations from all the doax games. 

let me know whats your say.
I am an Extremely skilled Game Developer which has mastered most aspects of game development except programming and music which are also going very well and will be mastered. If you need to see the girls in action from the content I have made so far for motivation or other reasons let me know and I will be glad to show you or send you a video of my current progress - PM me or reply here }

I am rather fed up with modding games only to still be restricted from what we truly want. We want full control - more than just modding textures and costumes, we want full modification - eventually I will also add muscle and skin modification so that individuals can crank up or lower the physique of the girls if the default original displeases users  
And of course even the finest of details like nail polish and breast size will also be editable as well as skin color and perhaps even the shader used  

To be clear those features are easy to implement for me - but as said Animations are key since a lot of what is remaining is rather easy or very easy or already implemented.

Thank you, Fatduck, for this great tool.

I do have one problem tho, when I import Settlers Rise of Cultures models they don't have any textures - is there a way around this?

Thank you for your time and help.

I have had the the same problem.
The .dds Files are encrypted too. You need to decrypt this files with another tool first.
See: [viewtopic.php?f=21&t=3165](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=21&t=3165)

Download S2Editors.rar from the first posting and extract the files to a new directory.
Just copy the .dds texture-files in the same directory.
Create a new "convert.bat"-File with the content

```
FOR %%i IN (*.dds) DO AdKEd.exe %%i
```
 execute it and all .dds files are decrypted on the fly and are ready for import in 3DS Max.

Ai there~
I discovered this importer only yesterday but it was enough time to droll all over the keyboard and such :Q___
I'll have to ask you, tou, to excuse me for my nibness but i have a few questions...
About S.U.N.
-I  ya 'cause i always sought for having a model/animation viewer for this game.
-Can't load some models (and their animations). These are models that came with the latest big update of the game... if you don't mind at looking at one of them:
[https://rapidshare.com/files/1545357914/M1201.rar](https://rapidshare.com/files/1545357914/M1201.rar)
Oh, also the model itself is loaded on noesis but not the animation.

Legendary Champions:
Well since you made me curious i downloaded/extracted it...
...but i always get an error when i try to open an animation which is "-- type error: Call needs function or class, got: undefined" i get the feeling is something silly but i'm not that good with autodesk so... 

Again sorry if these are silly questions ^^"
And thanks in advance~

You've to put the Fatimporter.ms + the folder into the "Scripts" folder, then it should run just fine.
Scripts should be in the same folder as plugins.
But i got 3ds max 2012, dunno if it's different for other versions ^^"

And nope, same with me. Lots of animations of certain models are just... schizophrenic!
But some works fine too
I don't know what tools you used to decompress the resource. But I known some animation decompressed from the resource are still zlib compressed. You have to decompress it again then you should be able to import them

I discovered this importer only yesterday but it was enough time to droll all over the keyboard and such :Q___
I'll have to ask you, tou, to excuse me for my nibness but i have a few questions...
About S.U.N.
-I  ya 'cause i always sought for having a model/animation viewer for this game.
-Can't load some models (and their animations). These are models that came with the latest big update of the game... if you don't mind at looking at one of them:
https://rapidshare.com/files/1545357914/M1201.rar
Oh, also the model itself is loaded on noesis but not the animation.
Could you upload 10 sets or more of these new ver. to me?
One is not enough!

Well since you made me curious i downloaded/extracted it...
...but i always get an error when i try to open an animation which is "-- type error: Call needs function or class, got: undefined" i get the feeling is something silly but i'm not that good with autodesk so...
Sorry, my bad. Some debug code in the script so you can't get it to work!
Here is the updated Legendary Champions script!

-I'll try to give it a look, thanks! 

-I could only found these 9 (+1 you already have) hope they'll be of any use 
[https://rapidshare.com/files/2507567209/S.U.N.rar](https://rapidshare.com/files/2507567209/S.U.N.rar)

-It's allright thank you! After all, you're working hard and mistake can happen :p

Oh i also noticed that some importer function doesn't work with 3ds max 2012 (errors) but works perfectly with 3ds max 9. An example would be Chaos Legion 

Edit: ok, i apologize for asking this and going OT but... could you tell me how to extract .pak files of Mo Siang? i couldn't found much on the net and some "tools" download for the game were expired, i sincerely dunno where to find an extractor ._.

I don't have any error at all!(In Max9 / 2009)

Did you put the files in the right folder?

FatImporter.ms should be in your 3dsmax8/scripts/ folder
and all the other files should be in 3dsmax8/scripts/FatImporter/ folder

I saw on a forum that you've also worked on Capcom's MT framework and made a MT famework script for max with an image of chris and sheva. If I'm right, what happened to it? did you finish it?? when are you going to release it???

Well, I lost everything a year ago.(Before start on FatImporter)
And I am not going to restart the old things again especially for the games already have tools to support them!
i'll go for something without any support first! So more games covered!

Textures are standard GIM inside every tpr! I am too lazy to include the decoder in FatImporter! so convert it yourself!
Here is a temp script while I am developing the importer. You might use this script to rip the GIM out of PAR(You still have to rip this part manually form tpr)

```
# Export GIM image out of PAR
# by Fatduck    Apr2010
# script for QuickBMS http://aluigi.org/papers.htm#quickbms

idstring "PAR\0"
get VER long
get NRES long
if NRES != 2
  cleanexit
endif
goto 0x14
get OFSPTA long
goto OFSPTA
get HEADER long
get VERSION long
get NUMGIM long
get DUMMY long
savepos OFSGIM
set TMP NUMGIM
math TMP *= 4
math TMP += OFSGIM
goto TMP
padding 16
savepos OFSNAME
for i = 0 < NUMGIM
  goto OFSNAME
  getdstring GIMNAME 0x20
  savepos OFSNAME
  goto OFSGIM
  get OFS long
  math OFS += OFSPTA
  savepos OFSGIM
  goto OFS
  getdstring DUMMY 20   #quick hack to get the gim size
  get GIMSIZE long
  math GIMSIZE += 16
  log GIMNAME OFS GIMSIZE
next i

Thank's a lot Fatduck for your work !

I have just one question, do you know how to export/convert Helpers dummy from 3ds max to bones in another program ?

Simply I just want to get some bones for my DOAX models in Blender/Milkshape 3D, and I completely lost about animation in 3ds max.

Export it as SMD, it's the easiest way.

Oh Yes you're right !

I totally forgot this format, (i'm using md2/md3 for animation exchange in Milkshape/blender).

Thanks a lot.

Is there a way to import textures for Magna Carta Phantom of the Avalanche models? Because when I load them, they have no maps. Do they need to be unpacked or something before? If yes, how?

If you keep the original path of models(3DOBS) and textures(TXRS). When you import a model, texture will auto convert and load!

Uhm... I didn't touch anything. Both folders are there, but when I select a model from the 3DOBS game folder there is no texture  model appears white.

EDIT: Textures work only if I copy the folders on my desktop, but then the models are all messed up. Keeping everything in place, the models load normally but without maps D: so I don't really know how to fix this problem. Is there a way to unpack a .txr file in order to apply the textures manually?

Hi sorry have been gone for a long time. Anyways here is a screenshot of a Prius model imported into 3ds Max 2013 (64-bit if it matters).
As you can see the Bip01 L Finger0 is selected in bone list, but the skin associated with it is incredibly wrong. This happens with every model that I have tested.

its because max 2013 auto sorts bone names so the id's he is matching up to in his scripts will not work.

But they didn't have any animation ? I mean, they always "stuck" like that ?

If I remember when I played this game, some fingers may move in gravure........

First of all thanks for the awesome update! ^-^

Which models are you trying to open? What version of autodesk are you using?
I do not have any problems at all, everything seems to work fine o.o

But... about Bounty Bay online... models visualization is strange

I see his "back" mesh while looking in front of it and viceversa.
And i get
"--Unknown property: "parent" is undefined" error when trying to load some of them while others seems to load fine.

For BountyBay Online. Sometimes normals are flips. Don't know why!?
And which models got that "--Unknown property: "parent" is undefined" error?
This game is a bit messy. It better to import *.ini in ..\INI\ folder to load the everything in one time!



S.U.N. fixed. Test with version 110, 112, 113, 114, 117, 118, 119, 120

This game is a bit messy. It better to import *.ini in ..\INI\ folder to load the everything in one time!

I apologize, dunno why but i didn't write "animations" some animations give me that error, unless, i got to run all those inis first? o.o
And ye you're right, it's not easy to associate animation-models and such in here

Oh and ehm...
About Zero of the World, those .tcpk files... is there any specific extractor? I still didn't look trou them but with a simple look on google i only found .cpk extractors and i doubt they'll work on it. That bms script in the folder is to convert textures but i'll have to extract them first anyway xD

Fatduck should have fixed the problem for you in his previous post~ But i also think that the problem may be caused by that old autodesk version, as i said a few months ago:

> Oh i also noticed that some importer function doesn't work with 3ds max 2012 (errors) but works perfectly with 3ds max 9. An example would be Chaos Legion
It may be the opposite case with S.U.N. ^^

Thank you for this tool.  I'm trying to work with Archeage files.  I realize it is only in beta, but I can't get any of the files to open.  It will either give a rollout handler exception error, or wont display the model at all. (.chr files)
Have you been able to successfully import these files?  or could it be that I am using 3DS max 8 ?  or does it work only with more recent versions?

Thanks again.

I use 3dsmax9 and 2009. Haven't got any error at all!? 3dsmax8 missing some bits operation command which might not work!?(I can't remember)

PS: I only have Archeage CTB2, the format might changed as well?(Since there are lots of bugs in the format) I don't know!

Sorry for that!

Thank you fatduck.  I will try to update my 3ds version and see if that helps.  I am using files from CTB5, so that may also be the cause.

You have to extract the rar file into your 3dsmax???/scripts/ folder!
and you will see FatImporter.ms and another sub folder call FatImporter in your  in 3dsmax???/scripts/ folder.

If you are using 3dsmax2013, skinning and animation will not correct!

Thanks A Bunch FatDuck You are a Legend! 
But This importer for the DOA still needs some work - many of the animations do not import Fully. They Do Import but some of the bones (Other than the Shoulders) such as the bone "Hips" become out of control during some animations that include movement such as the Hitomi Dance and Many Others.

To Fix this I removed all the keys on the hips bone - This stops the Crazy Jitter but later reveals that there really is a wrong bone assignment because for this example "Tinas Situps Gravure" After the Hips animation is removed Her Spine Should be going upward toward her legs to complete the sit-up motion but instead her legs go upward toward her Spine which is quite different from the original Animation. 

I would like a match with the original animations - this means I want to see the players running around in the scene rather than being stuck on the spot as I believe that's how it was in the game - There are signs that the import was done incorrectly on the shoulder but you showed a fix for that but More is needed to fix these last ones. Once that part is fixed I can then make real use of this script and then give you a nice donation. Once again thank you!

In This next post I show you exactly what I mean to make it easier for everyone. 
As you can see I also have a biped because I plan to Re-Target animations onto the biped (help with this is also appreciated).

But back to the original topic - this is what happens in plain and clear sight.
At first you will notice that there is a problem with the "Hips" orientation but another which I have noticed is That the more times I load an Animation the More Far down the line that places itself - initially that was at 10000 now The Animations have loaded at 70000 Frames! (I think this is a bug). 

Now For The Video - Here is a link to the Private Video on Youtube which I recorded Showing whats happening.
*Do not worry about the Shoulders.*
*I deleted the Hips by accident - But the result is still the same just without the funny looking crotch*

[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5P_3fzRRJC8](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5P_3fzRRJC8)

So you will notice that I compare Kasumis Situp animation with The One I imported - This should be the correct way but as you can see when I show the one imported by your script there are problems even AFTER I remove the hips Keys to stabilize the character. I believe you may have intentionally stabilized the character because when she dances tinas dance she should be walking around the scene freely. Anyway I will let you deal with these. And once you fix em I will donate because by then I can make use of em.

Oh great! Are your Paradise .mot files the same as DOAX2 .mot files? As in can your importer read DOAX2 Animations since they look like the same format. Its nothing major but DOAX2 has some extra animation like toes and stuff but as long as you get the Paradise one working perfectly that is enough .

Also are going to do anything about Re-target the animations from Bone to biped? Because if I can take the animations onto a biped I can put on any Biped which means many girls!
Also when does this Season 4 come out cause I really want now lol!
If you make Retarget from Bone to biped I take donation up to $50!
And will donate after you release to me OR tell me your ready and I pay first and then get the program - whatever works for you.


Also could you tell me the difference between "gr_ayane01m.mot" they all seem to have the same animation but they have m, l, x, s do you know what the difference is?

I eagerly await season 4 for the doap update. So far I got the models swapped and implemented my own toe , face and other animations to replace what is absent from doap. 
I retargetted the animations to the Original doax2 model too! Now in my game engine I have pretty much a replica of doax2 running with animations alongside my own built girls :)

will post a link as a private video if anyone is interested. Just ask!

...
As always i've to annoy you (under festivities too @.@), it's about Trinity...
Is the game still active or it closed down?
Every single link i found (and your bms script too) refers to this site
[http://trinity.goorm.com/](http://trinity.goorm.com/)
But it just give me an error, and seeing goorm game's there's no sign of Trinity online (online west & east + Astonishia) infos on the game are from 2009

Edit: or... this is it? (Called Trinity 2 online) 
[http://t2.pmang.com/index.nwz?mKey=7&sKey=1](http://t2.pmang.com/index.nwz?mKey=7&sKey=1)
May you in case provide a download link? 
Thanks, again, for you efforts and hard work ^^

Edit 2: Okay i still dunno which one you meant, but Trinity 2 works perfectly with both bms and fatimporter, so i'm happy anyway

Hi Fatduck, chroxx sent me here

I'm trying to convert the format .SKI from Online Saint Seiya, I tried to translate a topic on the Gameresearch forum([http://gameresearch.5d6d.net/thread-332-1-1.html](http://gameresearch.5d6d.net/thread-332-1-1.html)) and managed to understand that you are already working in this type of file, it seems to be a little different from other games of Beijing Perfect World

if you have any progress would post here? I really want these models, I'm a cosplayer and usage models to create my armors

This importer construct bone frame as dummy,so if u use bippy to xform animations,The dummy's construction direction
will make bippy construct the wrong direction bipes.like the red bones inthis picture below.it's pelvis bone,it should point upward but rightward.


Does anyone know which script file in this importer pack is used to construct bone frame?I will try to rewrite it.

 So, I tried to import models from Tales of Heroes: Twin Brave (since this and all of the Tales of the World games uses the same format). It worked for the most part, with the exception of a few models. 
One error says "Exception: -- Unable to convert: undefined to type: Color". The other error I get is "Error in Mesh[0100]Chunk!".  The model dumped looks like this:

The script for this one is "5a2cfd0f.ms".

What game is it?

The Game is Doa Paradise, I too used Bippy and it didnt work well with this, the rotations are not correct. 
Someone should fix this, as the animations DOA paradise have do not move hands or toes or face with this importer. They use morphs for hands and face and plainly don't move toes unlike Doax2 (probably PSP limitations). 

If someone makes a proper converter that would be nice. 
Also some of the animations Base (Bip0) do not perfectly resemble the Paradise ones , theirs Jittering and pulling at times....
Its great anyway but this fix would be much more useful . Thanks! And let me know if anyone gets a solution to this!

I think this will help; 

Normally bones from standard max characters have different pivot rotations than ones from Doa Paradise and some other games (I think Tekken 6 had this too). 

For the Doax2 and Doa Paridise this easily noticeable when you click a  bone and select rotate, what you will notice is instead of the pivot being from the top of the bone where it emerges from its parent the pivot on those bones is at the bottom. 
Here is an example, I believe this will be of some help;

You select the Knee Bone OR what would look like the Knee but you notice it says LFoot because it controls the rotation of the left Foot which is below the knee and parented. This is not normal for rigs but it is here apparently. I think it is possible that because a Biped Hierarchy uses traditional parenting rather than the Doa Paradise and Doax2 method that it could be that the bone that is called the LFoot but is actually the LKnee would convert to the Left Knee of the biped but it would not move the LFoot because the Left Knee of a biped uses the standard self pivot which means it would rotate itself instead of the LFoot since the hierarchies are different. 

Reply to this if this has helped you or if you want to say something .

Nice update FatDuck!
Have you tried to use Bippy before?

Bippy converts Bones to Biped and works on standard rigs. But it doesn't work on some of the games where they have reverse bone pivots (read the posts by me in this thread on this page).

I would like to convert (as well as a few others here) Doa Paradise animations to Biped animations so they can be re-usable across many rigs. If you like download the tool as it is maxscript and check it out.

[http://www.geoffsamuel.com/Project_Files.php?proj=6](http://www.geoffsamuel.com/Project_Files.php?proj=6)

Try using it on some of your rigs, you can modify the script for our personal uses to work in tandem with some of your games OR create your own custom rig converter. I am sure many of us would be appreciative.

if you do it I and maybe others will donate a little bit. I can donate $15 to your cause once its done, thanks again Fatduck!

I am intended NOT to suppot Standard ragging in 3dsmax. The reason is simply I don't won't want to turn FatImport into "Fat Convert" which in favour of modder hijacking game content!

FatImport use the game coordinate directly into 3dsmax. And I use 3dsmax internal animation function to rotate / flap into it's own coordinate (That why I like 3dsmax as my programming choice).
If the game use the same coordinate as 3dsmax do. you will be luck enough to convert/reuse them!

I can make you a private version of DOAP importer which support Standard ragging! PM me for that.

Venetica went on Steam today (a game I hadn't heard of) and turns out to be pretty awesome. Saw there was tools that could import the models! 

Tool not available anymore...

Sigh, I'm always too late to get tools. Anyone mind sharing it via PM?

Ok, downloaded 3DS Max, installed FatImporter in the right folder, run the MaxScript. Now, I've chosen KwonHo (I have the game), clicked the panel, appeared option of importing animation (.ANI), mesh (.MSH) or skeleton (.SKT). Of course, they're all packed. And FatImporter didn't unpack it. How do I do?  

KwonHo need to be where? Did I forget something?

Yay, thanks, C.E.!  

I didn't realize that I needed to use BMS code to extract the .PAQs, I thought that FatImporter would do it all alone.

V2 worked very well, thanks-a-lot! 


EDIT: This script also works with World of Jing Wu, you only need change KH01 for JW01.

Some help needed here (Once more...)

Need to export KwonHo animations. But 3DS Max only exports to .XAF.
And I need FBX animations to work with Softimage.
Where can I find a plugin or MaxScript that enables 3DS Max export to FBX animation? Or to convert XAF into FBX?
(Tried 3DS Max's embedded FBX export and Autodesk FBX converter plugin. None of them worked for animation.)

- Post Title: Re: 3d Models, animation importer - FatImporter

I can't understand this, Fatimporter isn't recognizing ANY of Dead of Alive Paradise model TRP files or animation MOT files at all, some of the TPR files appear to open but then give the error "Unknown property: "transform" in undefined" but most of the TRP files give a "Not a valid DOA Paradise Model File!" error.

When i used fatimporter's own doap.arc/doap.bin unpacker script in quickbms, it appeared to extract everything well (4843 files), but i find it strange that half of the TPR files i find on the folders doesn't have a PAR header string, which are the ones that fatimporter complains it's not a valid DOA paradise model file, but i tried to open ALL the ones having a PAR hear string one by one and ALL of them give the exact same error about the unknown transform property.

In earlier posts here on this thread i seen someone was able to import these models in fatimporter so i can't understand what i did wrong, i tried both the latest 2014 version of fatimporter here on this thread and the older 2013 version, i am using 3d studio max 2012 (which isn't the problem since fatimporter IS importing correctly models and animations from other games), and i tried the USA, EU and JAPANESE PSP versions of Dead or Alive Paradise games, always with the exact same results.

Can someone help me on this?

It seems maybe you downloaded the wrong version of the game maybe or extracted the files wrong? If you are able to run the fatimporter for other games then you should be able to import the models and animations without any problems.

It's been a long time since I dealt with this stuff but I assume you used quickbms to extract them?
The bin folder contains the animations in .mot format and the char folder contains the characters example: vay1.tpr.

It could also come down to you having an outdated version of the importer itself.

Well, i can't find any other version, like i said i tried 3 different versions (Europe, Japan, USA), i noticed that the doap.arc and doap.bin files have EXACTLY the same crc values in the three versions, despite the games being from different regions, so i don't even think this would be a bad rip from the games.

The crcs from the files are like this :

```
doap.bin  [CCA3B90A]
```


> maybe or extracted the files wrong?
Well it's strange that the bms script haven't given any errors :

```
  coverage file 0    86%   255880     296864     . offset 0000000000048797
  coverage file 1    98%   359376144  364507136  . offset 0000000015b96003
```


> It could also come down to you having an outdated version of the importer itself.

I am using the DOAParadise.bms script that came with Fatimporter, and Fatimporter's version is this one on this thread :

FatImporter (Sep ) 2014 

http://www.mediafire.com/download/a3ywr ... r_2014.rar

I also tried a older one (FatImporter_V151_May2013.rar) and got exactly the same results. I am using quickbms 0.8.0 but i doubt this is the problem.

Well, i have an idea, i am sending in attachment a few files, see if you're able to open these, it's from the Char\vay1 and Char\vaybb folders (the first one isn't even recognized by fatimporter and the second crashes the fatimporter script, it's almost like it gets partially exported, note the PAR header on this one) and 2 random .mot files from the Bin folder (no idea which .mot files corresponds the the models on char).

In case you can't open them too, please extract the same files from your game and if your fatimporter is able to open them sucessfully while mine don't, then send in attachment the same files from your extraction just to check if they open in mine. This way we can see if the problem is in the quickbms script or fatimporter or even 3dsmax itself (i am using 3dsmax 2012 remember, not sure if that's the problem).

> If you are able to run the fatimporter for other games then you should be able to import the models and animations without any problems.
Yeah that's what i find strange... But from the headers of the files i suspect they aren't being extract correctly, since not all tpr files have the PAR header, same with .mot files too.

> It's been a long time since I dealt with this stuff but I assume you used quickbms to extract them?
Unfortunately i found no other way to extract them from the doap.arc and doap.bin files, did you found any other way to extract the files??

The files you gave me are trash and don't work at all haha. It seems I can't upload the same files you sent me either in the version that works because for some reason they exceed 256 kb upload limit. It seems you extracted them wrong. 

I have attached the Quickbms script that I got from a friend who knew this guy, who knew this guy, who knew this guy, who knew this guys cousin....Try downloading Quickbms and use this attached script to unpack it and see how it goes.

Trash? Yeah that's what i feared, oh well at least now we know the problem isn't on fatimporter, but the extracting process itself. Regarding the script you sent me, it's the EXACT same i already tried... so of course it gave the exact same results, jeez... But still thanks for trying to help  Actually this is the very same script that came in the fatimporter package itself, the only difference is a few extra blank lines, which of course still gives the same result.
