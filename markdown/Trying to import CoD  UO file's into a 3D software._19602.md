- Post Title: Trying to import CoD : UO file's into a 3D software.

Hey guy's, I'm trying to import CoD : UO file's into a 3D software, like Cinema 4d or Blender. I'm pretty sure it's an 'x Model' like all of the CoD file's (for what I understand). I've tried this ([https://github.com/CoDEmanX/blender-cod](https://github.com/CoDEmanX/blender-cod)) but I think it only work's on old version's of blender. I've uploaded a file I'm trying to import for you guy's if you need it, [https://mega.nz/#!G100GIbJ!EsQ3vV4vrL1v ... wypF__Qfsk](https://mega.nz/#!G100GIbJ!EsQ3vV4vrL1vUNH02fVCu9TVd6OEHIfJZwypF__Qfsk) . I want to import it so I can export it as .obj or .fbx.

I got the blender x Model import to work but it doesn't recognise the file I'm trying to import.

Loading your mp44_mp file into wordpad it doesn't seem to contain any 3D data (9 kB is even too small for such, imho).
