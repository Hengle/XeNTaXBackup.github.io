- Post Title: (PS2) Rayman Revolution VSB and VB files

After finally figuring how to use the Java tool to extract the sound bh file, I came across the VSB (Voice Sound Bank) and VB (Voice Bank) files. VSBs are used for tutorials and cutscenes, while VBs are used for general level or cutscene sound effects

Psound can play both, but the audio can be screwy sometimes (either the wrong Hz is detected, audio randomly is stereo and played at the wrong speed despite correct pitch, or choppiness)

Here are some samples of the files; [https://mega.nz/folder/U7oTnAiC#L09iC19p9g0XBELuNNbFjQ](https://mega.nz/folder/U7oTnAiC#L09iC19p9g0XBELuNNbFjQ)
