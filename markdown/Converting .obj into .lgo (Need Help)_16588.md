- Post Title: Converting .obj into .lgo (Need Help)

Hello everyone,

I am trying to convert a .obj file into .lgo

I found a converter in this forum that converts only lgo into obj.

Can anyone share a tutorial/program. (I am willing to purchase your time if you are up to help, name the price! ! )

The reverse way is a shitload of work in most cases. Especially when you want to have the .lgo loaded by the game.

(I'd suggest to start with understanding the .lgo to obj conversion. This would be a good start for the reverse way. )

Maybe search for Pko SDK (Pirate king online). Might be helpful, don't remember its features.

Yes, it's a Tales of Pirates II game
I already managed to convert lgo to obj ( I am able to view the obj on 3ds max ).

I also created my own obj file, how can i convert it to lgo so i can use it in game?
