Hey all, just after some help/tips on how I could extract some game models from the original Call of Duty. After doing a bit of looking around on ripping models I've been trying to use NinjaRipper to get the models out but nothing I seem to do with that works. Any help would be appreciated!

You can use Wraith Archon program, it's free and it can get you almost any model from Call of Duty game series, including characters, weapons, props, vehicles with their textures etc. However it works only with licensed Steam copies of the game.
