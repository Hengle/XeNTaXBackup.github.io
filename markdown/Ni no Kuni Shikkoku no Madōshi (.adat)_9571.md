Hey  After hours of doing my own research I stumbled right into this Forum and decided that you guys might be the most capable community to help me with my problem. English is not my native language, so please don't mind me making lots of mistakes.Also after reading lots of the Forum posts here I realized that I'm a complete noob when it comes to hardcore extracting files so I might need really detailed instructions in case you are able to help me. I'm a graphics designer and a geek but I never wrote a single script line in my life.So I will at least be able to follow you without problems. So enough of me wasting your time, lets get right into my own personal challenge 

I'm in Florida right now, visiting a Friend who happens to have a Japanese version of Ni no Kuni: Shikkoku no Madōshi. I'm totally crazed about its art style and I decided to do some further research into it.I was able to play its videos that are saved in .pam Files, but I expect the textures and models to be in the biggest file I found in their folders.

I don't know if I'm allowed to upload some of the smaller files for you to work with, cause it's still copyrighted material and I have no idea how to give you samples like everyone else seems to know how to here, so please let me know what I can do for you.

The File is called "hd01.adat" and has a size of about 3gb. 
The Folder also contains: 
bd03.adat 250mb
bs04.adat.sdat 600kb
hs02.adat.sdat 82mb
libTGV_v1.45.05.sprx 284kb

I can provide any of these if needed.

I did some research in the Forum itself and found 2 Threads about this game. 
This here is one of them : [viewtopic.php?f=10&t=7932](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=7932)

Sadly all I could figure out in there, is that I could try extracting it with Offzip which did not work -_-
Also they are talking about file types that I can't even find in the Folders. The Links in there are outdated but they might have
helped me getting the textures.

I'm thankful for any advice you can give me. Thx so much

I'll rebuild my tools and post them soon. All I got out of it was the book textures/JPEG files. Model format was a nightmare. Doubt anyone in their right mind will touch it.

This was the tool I released on the other page. Just place it where the dat files are and run it. Don't put those DAT files on your desktop, you will regret it as it scan all folders and subfolders for DAT files lol. Leave them in the game directory.

All it does is extract files from the archives; it does not do any models or anything.

BTW, judging by the way your filenames are, it doesn't look like you ripped the game properly, or, you downloaded a bad rip. SDAT and EDAT files are still encrypted. Your console needs to be jailbroken (or you need to find a proper rip).

Thankyou so much, gonna give it a try in a few minutes  And yea I did not use my friends version cause I got no idea how to rip it. But I don't think ripping that one would get us better results,right? I'll see what I get out of this.Thx again!
