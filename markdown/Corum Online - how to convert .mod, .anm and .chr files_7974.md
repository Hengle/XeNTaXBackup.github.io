- Post Title: Corum Online - how to convert *.mod, *.anm and *.chr files

Hey, i need help in conversion 3d objects from *.mod (model), *.anm (animation) and *.chr (info) files to 3ds, maya or blender format. 
*chr. files can be opened with notepad. Textures are in *.tif and *.tga files.
Here is link to example 3d objects: [::edit:: Look at the second post ::edit::]
Thank you for help 
[edit]
Forgot to add - these *.mod and *.chr can't be opened in 3ds max...

I heard its possible to edit with Maya 3D, but needs a proper patch/extension for it to work. Unfortunatelly couldnt find it. 
*.chr files are possible to view with Notepad.
If anyone could help me open these files - I would be very grateful.
