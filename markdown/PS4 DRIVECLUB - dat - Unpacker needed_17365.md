- Post Title: PS4 DRIVECLUB - dat - Unpacker needed

Hey,

I'm looking for an unpacker for DRIVECLUB.
This game has several .dat files in numerical order.
I uploaded a bunch of them (06, 08, 09) and a few unrelated files, in case there is some information there - I dont really know. lol
If more files are needed, let me know.

[https://drive.google.com/drive/u/2/fold ... T6nmhPpU9-](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/2/folders/1dcjCr-SkAcU-8lM06FswQKT6nmhPpU9-)

Thanks.


edit: if you want/need the decrypted files, PM me!

Same thing here !

I'm ready to start reversing cars/maps, but I will need an unpacker first.

According to aluigi, it's a terrible format.
And he is THE quickBMS guy!

Oh yeah, I just saw that.



But it seems we can already see and extract things manually after using this script.

Really?! I didn't even try that - he said it was useless. hahah 

If you have a Zenhax account, maybe you can keep him updated of what you are doing?
Maybe he will update for better compatibility.

So finally succeeded to output some 3D from Driveclub.

I took the game034_unpack.dat (I use the complete decompress .dat)

Then, vertices indices starting at 0x132DE, prior to that, at 0x132D8, 0C = 12 (will be the strip for the vertices).

The faces indices start at 0x3D35DD (I think).

Hi all!
Hope someone can help me. I'm trying to extract models from Driveclub. While it is possible to get the model vertices, but it is not possible to extract the faces. It also looks like the model is initially flattened. I used 3D Model Researcher to view the models. Did anyone manage to fully extract the models from the game?

I have released an unpacker for .ndx/.dat files. It has been tested with 1.28.
It is unrelated to RPK/Resource Packs however, those are containers with all sorts of data.

Additionally i've figured and documented the RPK ToC.

Now you can start opening models. So far, here's what
