Yu-Gi-Oh Online 1  used LZSS compression on some files

Here are some files [http://www.sendspace.com/file/bqdses](http://www.sendspace.com/file/bqdses)

these files are simply ZIP archives with different signatures and luckily the "magic" zip.bms can do a perfect job with them:
[QuickBMS](http://aluigi.org/papers.htm#quickbms) and [zip.bms](http://aluigi.org/papers/bms/zip.bms)

Maybe I am totally wrong, but if the .bms file contains the necessary information to extract the data from these ypk zip files,
wouldn't it be also possible to create such archives?
What I would like to do is extract the textfile containing the words censored in the ingame chat from the ypk, alter it - i.e. delete all words
or at least change them - and then save that textfile into the ypk. In Yu-Gi-Oh! Online 3: Stardust Accelerator the censoring is extremely
annoying. The file containing the censored words is really just a plain textfile containing *quickly checking* 998 words. Even if a word you enter
contains a word from the list as a part it is censored - for example you couldn't write classy â€¦ that would result in cl***y, because
the word ass is of course censored. Maybe you can imagine how much fun it is to use that chat. ^_^'

I hope there is some tool somewhere that can create archives based on the algorythm information contained in .bms files.

the archives are simple ZIP files with the following differences:
- instead of having the PK signature they use YO
- it's used only the local file header of the ZIP archive so without end and central

I guess you can pack the extracted files in the following easy way:
- zip them using the deflate algorithm (I tell you because some archivers like winzip use other algorithms like 7zip/ppm if you set the highest compression)
- open the zip archive with a hex editor and replace any occurrence of the bytes "50 4b 03 04" with "59 4f 03 04"
- change the extension from zip to ypk

This change would probably be visible on your pc only and all other players would still see stars ****

OK. That's giving me hope ^_^
Please tell me what tool I can use to zip them using the algorithm from the bms file. Please make it some sort of manual if possible 
Hex-Editor is OK. I know how to use these.

I usually don't do this, but I urgently need help/guidance with this.
