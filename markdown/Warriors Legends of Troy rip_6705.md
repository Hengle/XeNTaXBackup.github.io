- Post Title: Warriors: Legends of Troy rip?

Hi! I don't have the game myself, but I was wondering if you guys could try ripping the music from Warriors: Legends of Troy, since a soundtrack isn't going to be released. I3arnaby on FFshrine tried, but they didn't work it out, saying the game uses "crap XMA with two headers, most likely interleaved." I thought you guys may have better luck.
