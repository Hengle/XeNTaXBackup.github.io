- Post Title: How can I repacking?

I have a unpacking tools.

but I don't have a repacking tools.

This file seems like have a C+ code. (I'm not sure..)

It is extract files (.idx & .pak)

If you have just only one file (ex. idx) you can't extract.

So you need to use 2 those files.

Here is files.
