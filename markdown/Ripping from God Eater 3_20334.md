- Post Title: Ripping from God Eater 3

I've been trying for a while to rip models with Ninja Ripper, but all I got was just the log file. I tried it on windows 8.1 and it extracted, but textures were fucked up.

I need to know if there any programs that could help me extract the models in t-posed body parts.

Hopefully there is some. Thank you.
