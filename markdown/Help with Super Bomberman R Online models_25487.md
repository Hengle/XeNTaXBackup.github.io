- Post Title: Help with Super Bomberman R Online models

Hello, it is my first time ripping so sorry if I did anything wrong.
Recently, I've been trying to get the models from the (steam version of the) game "Super Bomberman R Online", made on the Unity Engine. I thought it would be as easy as going in AssetStudio and opening up files, but this game has a very... different type of files.

I've tried every method I know. If anyone could help me, it would be very appreciated...
