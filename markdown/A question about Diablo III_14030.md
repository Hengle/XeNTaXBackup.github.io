- Post Title: A question about Diablo III

Hey guys, i just wanted to know if there is any tool out there that will show me the diablo 3 animations like WOW model viewer does? so i can see them fully skinned and animated? dont necessarily want to export them in to max/maya just look at them in full animated glory.
