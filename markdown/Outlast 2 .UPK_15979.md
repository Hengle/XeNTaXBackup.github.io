Unfortunately Gildor wrote this:

However, the models can be ripped with NinjaRipper.

best thing you can do is go over to gildor's forums and join in the Outlast 2 thread. He doesn't have any interest in the game, but others do, so the more that get on the forum and ask for it, the more likely he is to do it.

Actually, I managed to unpack these. You just need to delete some zero bytes in chunks header. Here's example - [https://mega.nz/#!2QtBTZxT!jpSrIt12Wvly ... P3_G_B99fk](https://mega.nz/#!2QtBTZxT!jpSrIt12WvlySYbMk08aSn6K7_PG7fDRgP3_G_B99fk).
