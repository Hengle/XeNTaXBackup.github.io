Heya peeps. Been a long time project of mine and while I'm getting better at coding I'm still not at the level where I can read and reverse engineer for scripts.

I got a request, and its mostly for older PS3 to Early PC stuff from Gust, its to grab out facial morphs for their characters. I am simply looking to have the faces as OBJ, as I can deal with making the morphs my self.

They appear to be in G1A format, but not including the model which is in g1m format. I decided to upload a sample which include raw and extracted format.

the process goes from
Elixer.gz >> elixir >> what ever is in those, mostly g1m's and g1t's and g1a's

As an example PC00A_MT_HAPPY is most likely a smile morph, simply put probably instructions on how to move the face verts from the model file, or part of the _FACIAL but they just seem to be deformation instructions.

I'd be happy if some one could take a look at this for me, but if not then well. its been a good year and a bit now I really don't think not having it would kill me
