As far as I know, all people who used unpacker didn't need to repack files back - they modified unpacked umd file and put it back to the game. Of course it is larger, but it works with no additional fuss.
Probably they had to "xor" resulting file, I don't remember. gildor.org forums has some threads about unpacking and repackaging this game.
