Hi mate,

I recently looked at this game and I think Game Extractor should be able to open it (it worked on the demo). Give it a go ( [http://www.watto.org/extract](http://www.watto.org/extract) ) and if it doesn't work then let us know and supply us with a small archive to look at.

Thanks mate.

hey there

mhmh i have tried gameextractor 
this archivextractor could extract the res file but 
the archiv iss not only a storage of files (gameextractor export these without file extensions) like i said a have searched very long in the net   but couldn't  find any possible extractor for such an res archiv
it seems like a complete resource file with an compiled part and an part of files witch are used by the game *wav and *.flc thy are linked in this file
the unit descriptions also open readable in this file.

the wav and flc files are stored in game folder 
and now i am confused with this file 
and thats the reason why i search for help wiht getting in the game   

I attach the file (17k) next week allright? so happy christmas to you all

So long

hey people

I have it promised an here it iss a free download for the max.res file

link: [http://rapidshare.de/files/10253343/MAX.RES.html](http://rapidshare.de/files/10253343/MAX.RES.html)

thanks to friendofwatto for the free upload page

the file should contain all game related information an rules
(in my opinion)

you will find some unit infos and file strings uncoded at the end of the file

and the complete game could be downloadable on a abandonware site

home of the underdogs or so
just take a look at [http://www.kickme.to/raw](http://www.kickme.to/raw) and in this link directory
you will find some amazing abandonware links
like frenchkiss and so on
just look 

THX for help guys

Thanks mate, I will look at the file for you soon.

I don't know if you were using a proper version of the game, or one from the  abandonware site. If abandonware, chances are that they have changed the format to remove things like video files - thats the biggest problem that would be faced when using "edited" games rather than the proper purchased game.

Will get back to you with any information.

Done. Here's the script. 

```
ImpType StandardTail ;
SavePos TailOffOff 0 ;
Get TailOff Long 0 ;
Get TailSize Long 0 ;
Set FileNum Long TailSize ;
Math FileNum /= 16 ;
GoTo TailOff 0 ;
For T = 1 To FileNum ;
GetDString Name 8 0 ;
SavePos FOO 0 ;
Get FO Long 0 ;
SavePos FSO 0 ;
Get FS Long 0 ;
Log Name FO FS FOO FSO ;
Next T ;

```


Should also allow replacement of files with MultiEx Editor.

Yep, and as mentioned earlier, Game Extractor will open this archive (just tested it with the file you sent), so you can use this program too if you wish. Otherwise, the script Mr Mouse posted should do the trick.

Good luck

@ friendsofwatto

I know that game extractor could open the archive and that game extractor also "extract" the files
but like i said the extracted files came without file extension
an that iss my Problem
also the "texted" part of max.res aren 't saved 
gameextractor only unpack the "filelinks" in the max.res archiv (i think)
maybe i am wrong

and thanks to mr mouse i will try your script today


it seems like that the files in the Res file programming files
like the lua files in the BIG archives in HW2 or so

and there must be decompiled i think so that you can do some changes in game (modding)
allright i will extract the files with multiex comm
and see what I can do

it iss possible that the Res file iss only a normal resource file
like in windows and that it contains only bitmaps and sounds

but i will see

THX for your help

anone know an good language identifier for the files???
could be helpfuel to "get in" the game

what I know definetly that this game archiv is an compiled Resource file
from MS C or C++ or maybe Borland C++ 

in case of my long search for an editor extractor and an decrypter for this file i am nearby to give up   
MS C compiler would be suitable for the game in my opinion
take a look on the release and this Compiler should it be i think

maybe here are some experts thy could help with such a problem

whatever 
Thank you people

I agree that this is a problem, but that is because the archive doesn't have extensions - thats not the fault of Game Extractor but rather the fault of the archive.

Good luck - maybe MexCom will prove better for you, although I expect it would probably be almost the same.

MexCom will also not show file extensions as there are none. The archive is much like Doom WAD files, with filenames only 8 bytes in size, without said extension. You probably should try to figure out from the hexdata and the names what type of files these are. You could also fuck up some files and see what the effect in the game is. But that is time consuming.

mhmh yes youre right

i am allways on it 
in HEX the files in that archive are stored as

for example ALNASG. FLC or only als ALNASG
there are more than one file 
but the extension .FLC arent identified by the extractors

but I must see

I also had made some changes 
in the unit stats
but the game shoot up with
a failure message
error in reading res file

so it seems like i said you have to decompile the file    

damned 
but i am on it 

maybe you have an idee 
just take a look at this file wiht an IDE or an HEX editor and you will see what I mean
