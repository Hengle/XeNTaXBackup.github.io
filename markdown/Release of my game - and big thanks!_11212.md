- Post Title: Release of my game - and big thanks!

I've been here quite a long time ago, and haven't stayed for too long, but still, I appreciate help of XeNTaX community very much (especially, mariokart64n and chrrox  )! So I'd like to show you that our [efforts](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=4350) were not wasted, and proper credits were given to people who helped me!

This is an open-source Unreal-style multipurpose multiplayer (mostly) Half-Life modification.
Full release news text goes [HERE](http://www.moddb.com/mods/xdm/news/x-half-lifexdm-3037-all-multiplayer-games-come-together) (+download link).

I guess, it's nice to see once in a while, what all the research made here was put into.
Once again, thanks!

Excellent! This is indeed great that we show what our efforts can bring us! Will certainly try the mod!   Got any gameplay vids?

Mr.Mouse: nope, sorry. Videos are my weak side, cannot make them on my PC (and probably won't have time to try anymore  )

MrAdults: so, you have something against porting? want to talk about it?
