it's the usual problem of the adpcm coefficient.
practically the file is a classical gamecube adpcm (aka dsp, it's visible by eye with a hex editor) but without the coefficient data it's only noise

I wonder if .whd might hold the headers... could you maybe post one of those? If you could put up the whole file system listing it might also suggest something.

Well, nothing good to report, but I guess I owe you a reply.  It looks like the .ssd files are sample banks, and the .srt files are references into them (they contain the proper DSP header with coefficient table).  I don't know how to match them up.  By the looks of it this is a sequenced music format, what with MH3BGM_QUEST.srt having quite a lot of DSP headers in it, probably setting up some .ssd as a sound font, and I wouldn't know where to begin with doing anything useful there.  Sorry.

Okay 
Anyway, huge thanks for studying the files and taking the time 
Maybe someone else will be able to figure it out *prays*
