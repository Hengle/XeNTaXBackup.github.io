- Post Title: How to view how Noesis loads a specific model type?

I'm trying to do some work with the Naruto Ultimate Ninja Storm files (writing a maxscript), and I'd like a good starting point. I know that Noesis loads those models, and I'd like to view the way that Noesis loads them. As far as I can tell, it's not in either of the plugins folders.
