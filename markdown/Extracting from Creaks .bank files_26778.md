- Post Title: Extracting from Creaks .bank files

I need help to extract audio/music from .bank files from the videogame Creaks producted by Amanita Design located in Creaks_Data\StreamingAssets.
I tried with AssetStudio, MultiExtractor, Fmod Tools Bank and vgmstream component for Foobar2000 but unfortunately nothing of these works.
Probably they are encrypted but I'm not sure. Any ideas?
