- Post Title: Valkyire Profile SLZ format

From what I understand it's a type 3, which is unsupported by the current BMS SLZ script. I think someone posted the algorithm for it in RomHacking, but that might have been for types 0-2. The file is 1gb so I can't really upload. unless you like downloading parts.

The name of the File is ?VP2_NB~1.1.
