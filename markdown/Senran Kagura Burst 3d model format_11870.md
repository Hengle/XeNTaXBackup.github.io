- Post Title: Senran Kagura Burst 3d model format

Hello everyone, due to the recent breakthroughs in 3ds rom decrypting, ive managed to get my hands on the Senran Kagura model files. I was wondering if anyone would be kind enough to help convert them into common  model format for everyone to see. They are compressed in binary zip type of files(besides the one I compressed them in), so you can extract them with things like winzip, 7zip.

Link Removed.

Thx in advance
