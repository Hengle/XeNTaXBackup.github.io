- Post Title: Dragon Quest XI S - BXON files

Hello,

I wanted to know if it was possible to extract the text from Dragon Quest XI S.
I used BMS to extract the PAK files. The problem is, the texts are not in the .locres files, but in the .bxon format.
Is there a way to extract these texts?

I have checked your samples and for me some sections in this file format are still unknown,
so I was not able to write proper text extractor, but maybe someone else will be able to help with that.

Here are my findings on this format [http://wiki.xentax.com/index.php/Dragon_Quest_XI_S_BXON](http://wiki.xentax.com/index.php/Dragon_Quest_XI_S_BXON)

Does the 3DS version not use this format?
Why have they tried to translate from Japanese to English.

I found this on GitHub. It has something or is useless?

I don't know this game, I have only analyzed those samples you posted.
Maybe you should contact some Dragon Quest modding community (if there is any).

This code seems to be for some other purpose, so I don't think it will help you,
but you can always try to run it.
