- Post Title: Aion XML files

Hi guys!

Can you help me find method to decrypt XML files from Aion: Tower of Eternity game?

I think that solution for this problem is somwere inside crysystem.dll file but im not a Reverse Enginering specialist so i can't do it myself.  

unpacked crysystem.dll can be found here [http://sharebee.com/1378465c](http://sharebee.com/1378465c)
