- Post Title: [Help] Noesis mirror models

Hello,
I've been working with Noesis for quite a while and I always had this issue. Whenever I open a model -it doesnt matter the game- , Noesis always mirrors it. For static props it doesnt really matters as I can mirror them later in 3dsmax but with rigged models its a big problem.
How can I export the models in the correct way? Is there any extra option to add when exporting? or it is just not possible?

Thanks in advance!
