basically you need to swap all datas by word (16 bit swap) to get them back to little edian pc format as xbox is big edian
also the file is dxt1 as you said

edit : also the dds data seems wrong in your file :
you got the mips datas then the level 0 image data witch is the invert of the dds specs !
