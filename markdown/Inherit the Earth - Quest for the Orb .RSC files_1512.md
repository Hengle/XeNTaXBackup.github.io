Think you could give this old game a shot? There used to be an explorer for this game but it has long since disappeared from the net. Also, there's a place somewhere that tells of this format used in the file storage.

Demo can be downloaded here I believe: [http://www.wyrmkeep.com/ite/download.html](http://www.wyrmkeep.com/ite/download.html)

Fast note: The version of RSC may differ from the one used in wyrmkeep's version. Hopefully not. Wyrmkeep took over the game project to port it to Windows.

Thank you, I will look at it soon, and let you know if I have any success.

OK, I have attached a Game Extractor plugin for this archive, which I will put in the next update (hopefully within a week) or you can use it now.

The plugin should work if you unzip it into your "GameExtractor/Plugins" directory, or the "GameExtractor/" directory. If not, you can do the following...

1. Unzip the attachment
2. Open GameExtractor.jar in a zip program like WinZip
3. Put the new plugin into the zip
4. Save it (as GameExtractor.jar , NOT GameExtractor.zip)
5. Run Game Extractor.

Good luck - I intend to get another Game Extractor update out soon, but I am still quite busy so my best estimate would be for an update in a weeks time.

Ah nice, thanks. Now I'll have to figure out the formats for each file type.

Maybe you can ask the guys who work on ScummVM because they got the sourcecode to "Inherit the earth" (source: [http://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php/SAGA](http://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php/SAGA)) and the new ScummVM 0.8.0 does support the game very nicely.

Hope that helps a little,
Frank

Ok, I know I'm kicking this old topic but I did find the tool I picked up on my old computer so many years ago (Like 5-6 years).

It is called ITEbrowse and can view and extract the images, scripts, music, and sounds. However there were unknown sections that were never found out about in the RSC files. I by chance found it on Planet Mirror after using the Web Archiver to look at the old pages of Reinherit where I came upon it's name.

The one named ITEBrowse v.991 RITE is the last one that was released before the project died.
