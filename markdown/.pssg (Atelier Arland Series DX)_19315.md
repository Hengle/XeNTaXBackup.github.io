Since no one did the .pssg format for at least 8 years, i want somebody to make a noesis script to import them with textures and bones so we all can convert to .fbx or whatever format that is available.

But there's normal's blocks (at 0x102C40 for example), too, so it's confusing a little bit. Even more confusing: they don't build spheres as normals would.
Don't have the time to look deeper atm.

This format has had updates with every single released game, a user has consistently updated the script and shared it on Xentax numerous times.
The games have a large hacking/modding community.

Please search harder in future, this was not difficult to find at all.
