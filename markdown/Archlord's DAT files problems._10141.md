- Post Title: Archlord's DAT files problems.

Hi, i've a problem to unpack Archlord's DAT files, i know that there are a lot of unpacker and a bms script put when i try to unpack a DAT file i get this error:

[http://tinypic.com/view.php?pic=34pm0as&s=6](http://tinypic.com/view.php?pic=34pm0as&s=6)

It's like my client has a DAT format a little bit different.

Can anyone help me? ( if you need dll, exe or other files tell me)
