- Post Title: TDU2 Save File Encryption

Anyone interested in cracking the save files encryption? Editing the save files would allow us to utilize all of the exclusive vehicles and still play online

I've personally tried Aluigi's tdudec, but I've either gotten the extension wrong, or the encryption is different from the .cpr files located within the root (likely the latter?)
We have successfully modified the GamePC.cpr, thus activating the exclusive content... however, this requires starting a new game, so the save files would certainly be 
the optimal choice in this matter. Any and all insight would definitely be appreciated

as written [here](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?p=49712#p49712) the code and the keys are the same but even after trying various combinations the result is incorrect.
I don't have the game so I have made a simple analysis of the executable but still nothing good

that's ok.. as always, many thanks for your efforts Aluigi

we hacked the streaming memory/cache via TSearch and accomplished what we set out to do 
(activate all exclusive vehicles which replaced the saved vehicles we already had in our garages)
