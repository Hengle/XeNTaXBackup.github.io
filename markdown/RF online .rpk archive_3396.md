Yeah, there was, but the author gave up on it I think due to the changing codes with each update...not sure if it still works or upto which update it works.

i think i need to make a "3d model viewer beer drinking party" and gather all model viewing programmers. Then i lock them in a basement and only let them out when they have made viewers for my specific needs.

I am starting now with some preparations

however has anyone managed to determine the   format/edit etc options for the R3T file from the archive, it should be the texture - but iv had no success opening it:
[http://mauro.pri.ee/files/55spear.r3t](http://mauro.pri.ee/files/55spear.r3t)

I dont even have  a idea how to get any info about that - hexing gave no useful results.

EDIT: these files seem to contain .DDS textures - the one above contains:
blade.dds
COM_WEAPON_TSPEAR_156.dds

The beginning of the file seems to be:

```
™™?
```
 or hex 
```
9A 99 99 3F 02 00 00 00
```

doesent tell me much about the format , and rest, besides the dds locations, is gribberish.

Also the 3 files are with the extensions:
.r3m r3 model
.r3t  r3 texture
.r3e  r3 effect

r3 is the engine game uses, developed by ccr - there is a source code for the engine available, but im not good with c++ to even find if there is any indication of how the engine  reads these files.
