- Post Title: Extracting Hidden Files from PS2 Sly Cooper Trilogy ISOs

Is this possible yet? I've seen threads dating back years of people asking for tools or methods to get the hidden WAC/WAL files off of Sly Cooper ISOs, and I have found no one having any success (at least, if they did, they never announced it).

I am attempting to rip all of the voice clips and music that I can find from the first three games, and while I have managed to rip most of what I need from the PS3 remaster without issue, seeing as there is no existing dump of the Japanese or Korean releases of the trilogy collection (If there is, someone please throw me a lifeline here), I have to turn to the PS2 versions for those (despite there being no Japanese Sly 3 release on PS2...).

While I have the ISOs and can use VAG scanners to get the voice clips I need out, it's rough and they're unnamed. It seems that if I get the WAC/WAL files, I might be able to get named files (maybe) with tools I found to rip from them. This would make sorting these rips a lot better.
Plus, it would be nice to get the BNK files for the original Sly 1 soundtrack and see if I can do anything with them, because the PS3 version kinda butchered it in some places IMO

I'm aware that some people probably already have these files, at least from the North American releases, but how did they get them??? I've driven myself half-crazy scouring the internet for any sort of method to dump these game archives from the PS2 ISOs and found nothing, so I'm getting desperate here.  

I do not know what I would need to provide for this, but someone said that ghost TOCs might be possible to reverse-engineer through the game's executables, so I will attach the executables ripped from the ISOs I have, for reference.

I'd've attached them using the site's attachment system, but it tells me it's too big no matter what size it is. So I'm putting it on MEGA.

Note that the Korean Sly 2 ISO has a SLY2.WAD file that isn't hidden. This file is hidden (or not present?) on the North American and Japanese ISOs. It's either encrypted or doesn't contain anything useful to me, and I don't have any tools to work with it. Not sure if it's significant, but I figured I'd mention it for the sake of being thorough.

I really hope that it is possible to crack these ghost TOCs. And I hope that if they have been cracked, it isn't some sort of hush-hush secret kept only to those in Discord servers or something.  

TL;DR Please help me I'm stupid and hyperfocused on getting the files off of the JP/KO PS2 ISOs but can't find out how to get the WAC/WAL files out because of that accursed "ghost TOC" crap
