- Post Title: [HELP] Car++

hey guys, im trying to break into a  chinese game with cars.

i found out the game downloads the file at the moment you select it. and i found out it adds it to the cache file
The game only Works on iphone, so i used a jailbroken iphone to figure it out.

here is the file with the most Kb's, its made in unity but i could not open it in unity.
If you need anything diffrent, let me know.
