- Post Title: [Help] Retargeting animations for MMD

I am now trying to rip animation files in CGSS, and I somehow managed to download all assets and converted the animations to fbx using chrrox's script and Akderebur's program. (huge thx)

But I am right now stuck in retargeting the animation for MMD.
Making it into bvh file would work but could not figure out how to make it.

Any help plz?
