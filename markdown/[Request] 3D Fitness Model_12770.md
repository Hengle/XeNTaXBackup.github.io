- Post Title: [Request] 3D Fitness Model

Hi,

Yourself fitness is an older renderware engine exercise game from 2005 with a pretty good character model and great exercise animations!


I am trying to find a way to get the model and animations from this game into blender.
I tried the Noesis .dff importer, but it didn't work on this file. 
I then opened the main character .dff model with a tool called  rwanalyze found here:
[http://www.steve-m.com/downloads/tools/rwanalyze/](http://www.steve-m.com/downloads/tools/rwanalyze/)

..but I can't understand what to do with the info, so if anyone here can look at it, that would be great!

I was looking at this file [https://www.mediafire.com/?4g7a3uwahmp58a9](https://www.mediafire.com/?4g7a3uwahmp58a9)


There is also a PS2 version but that seems to be packed and probably extra work to get to the model and anims.

Looks similar to DragonBall format.

Using [The Hero's Renderware tools](http://gtaforums.com/topic/752450-rel-renderware-file-converter/) and [Kam's MaxScript for GTA](http://www.gtagarage.com/mods/show.php?id=9172) you can import the files into 3ds Max, albeit with no rigging. Also stuff like hair isn't positioned correctly.

thanks for the tool links!

They did work for the static model, so I applied the textures and manually positioned the hair in a quick and rough manner.



This looks like the complete skeleton with position and rotation data?



How can I make a rig from it?

Hmmm, Looks like 3DObject Converter will import the models without the need for conversion!



But still no Skeleton.
