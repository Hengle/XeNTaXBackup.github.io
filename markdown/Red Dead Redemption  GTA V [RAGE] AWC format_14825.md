- Post Title: Red Dead Redemption / GTA V [RAGE] AWC format

Hey.
I need help decoding the AWC format used in Red Dead Redemption for PlayStation 3.
I know that the awc files are actually uncompressed "archives" containing mp3 files.
The mp3 files are split every X seconds and they are also split by channels.
It's really messed up. Especially as mp3s don't have a real header, but tons of headers. So can someone explain that format for me?
Examples: [http://puu.sh/qumMC/64651d8b78.zip](http://puu.sh/qumMC/64651d8b78.zip)
The exe is able to extract the awcs to mp3. Basically I want to make a tool that does the same.

Can someone help me? Please
