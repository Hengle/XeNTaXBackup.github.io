- Post Title: InstallShield .Z archives..

Does anyone know how to extract the files from these? I've tried 7zip and winrar, but the .Z files they support are different..

the header magic is "13 5D 65 8C 3A 01 02 00"

i have attached the first and last 0x1000 bytes from the file

well the installer is 16 bit executable for a game which wont run on my 64 bit machine.

i will try that software thank you

EDIT: it could not open this file. I think the InstallSheild .cab and .z files are different types of archives.

the game is star wars the phantom menace for PC

after digging around I have found this program which both compresses and decompresses the .z files [ftp://ftp.elf.stuba.sk/pub/pc/pack/icomp95.zip](ftp://ftp.elf.stuba.sk/pub/pc/pack/icomp95.zip)

close please
