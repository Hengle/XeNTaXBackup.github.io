I have updated the script for quickbms:

the only difference was type 1 which is zlib instead of xemdecompress

quickbms can reimport the modified files back in the archives:

It really is very easy to make the re-importer now, much thanks.

has only one thing, the procedure did not change anything tets in the archives just to see if it works, right? there when I did it with BOOTTEXTDB.BFF file is the file containing the texts, he reimported beauty, the three files in it, only when I put in the game to work, it stands on the first screen that you need the files text, then I put the original file and goes normal, does it have anything to be done?

Thanks ..

probably it checks a crc or something similar, in that case you can't use the quickbms reimporting solution

It's not possible to mod due to the installed game data being encrypted. It's the same with Gran Turismo 5
