- Post Title: (Help) I need to extract the internal files of a visual novel

HELLO TO EVERYONE IN THIS GREAT COMMUNITY, I HOPE YOU ARE WELL!  

Just as you read friends haha..  I make this post because I really need your help to extract all the internal files of a Japanese visual novel, known as Himitsuri No Lagoon or Lagoon Lounge, to which I want to make a translation patch to Latin Spanish to its three original installments. From what I researched the game was developed in Ren'Py, I'm trying to use QuickBMS for the extraction issue but I need one or more specific scripts but I can't find anything and the worst thing is that the "exe" of the game only comes with a "dll" extension file, I don't know how to start, I've been burning the little gray matter I've always managed for days  . If someone could help me I would appreciate it very much. Thanks again for your attention and patience.   


I attach the link of the game in case a hero without a cape wants to check my case: [https://www.mediafire.com/file/jmycrnpj ... 2.rar/file](https://www.mediafire.com/file/jmycrnpjl18l61w/LL2.rar/file)

There's some useful tutorials video by iwanMods regarding RenPy game modding. Here's it:

How to Decompile .RPYC & Mod RenPy Games (Story/Dialogue/Text Modding)
How to extract images, music, sound from Ren'Py Games (RPA File)

Hope this help

It doesn't look like Ren'Py game at all. It doesn't have any RPA/RPYC files.
