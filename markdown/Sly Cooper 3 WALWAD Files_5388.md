- Post Title: Sly Cooper 3 WAL/WAD Files

Sly Cooper 3, for the PS2 uses compression in its data file, which is a sole file called SLY3.WAL (For Demos) or SLY3.WAD (For the full game, which is about 3.5GB). Here is a link to the first 2MB from a demo disc. It appears to start off right off the bat, with no header. [http://ps23dformat.wikispaces.com/file/view/SLY3.WAL](http://ps23dformat.wikispaces.com/file/view/SLY3.WAL)
Is there a way to decompress these files?
