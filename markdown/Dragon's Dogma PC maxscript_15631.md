- Post Title: Dragon's Dogma PC maxscript?

so, is there any chance I can ask if a maxscript can be made for DDDA PC

because MT_Framework screws up the skeletons of most monsters, and zaramot's script only works for xbox360 and ps3

if someone can help with this that would be awesome :3
if not well...... I suppose i'm out of luck :/

please I need an answer

Please be patient, it is not that nobody wants to help. It is useful if you offer more clarity i.e what did you mean by "MT_Framework screws up the skeletons of most monsters"? Anyway, if a Xbox 360/PS3 script is out there, I would recommend attempting to switch the endianness of what the data is read in. IIRC MT Framework's model format is the same across all platforms with some small platform specific changes.

Cheers.

well, what happens is (and this pretty much happens with dragons and other creatures with similar skeletons) the bones are spread out an misplaced from the mesh itself thus the rig is useless (btw I apologize I've been through a lot of stress lately in life)
 here is how Grigori's looks in both blender and Max (P.S. I tend to use blender a lot more than Max)

if you need some of the .mods I have extracted i'll PM them to whom ever asks

Hmm, I know there's nice script for MT Framework games, for this reason I really haven't look at this yet. Post few samples here, I will take a look and edit my script for consoles (since I'm sure the only difference is endianess - lets hope on that xD)

I wouldn't know of course (but out of curiosity) is it possible to extract animations? because I lately have been thinking of adding creatures from Dragons Dogma into Skyrim as enemies? i'm probably asking a lot with that... but honestly it is better to ask than to not say anything (aside from that just the models alone are what I need for... SFM (yes I just said that)T-T)
