- Post Title: Ripping from ANS, BNS, and CNS files?

I was looking to get some sound files from the game 'Dynasty Warriors Gundam 3' but the entire game seems to be packed into these 3 files judging by their disc size ([https://s18.postimg.org/mt2zp4f21/Dynas ... iors_3.png](https://s18.postimg.org/mt2zp4f21/Dynasty_Warriors_3.png)) Does anyone have experience ripping from these files or know a method because running PSSound on the ISO did me no good so I'll probably have to do it the hard way
