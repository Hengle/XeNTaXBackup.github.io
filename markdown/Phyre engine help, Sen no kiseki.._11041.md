I heard that it is too hard to unpack .phyre engine files. But would someone can unpack it?
Here is sample. [https://www.mediafire.com/?bghvya39f1ffr3j](https://www.mediafire.com/?bghvya39f1ffr3j)

btw: what do you mean with "unpack"? Did you refer to the models or to the textures?

Wht is that tool?
Is that able to find Hex to Obj?
I cant parse Hex where is starting and ended
and how to change useful code

Not only rip "Senokiseki" but also  "俺の妹がこんなに可愛いわけがないHappyEnd" can do 
I want to that is a minor game nobody interest

Sorry for my bad English

Thanks for the info on this your tool works great,
but any idea where the UV's are in the file i just can not find them

To get the answer you should try using a small regular object such as a box, a chest or a book.

After you got them for the box you'll have an idea where to search them in more complex models.

Thanks for the advice, I tried it on a random object and actually found the UV data.
Tho the vertex data was in a different place this time which was strange

Nope. It's not intended to be used on image files.

Use TextureFinder to display dlc7010_0.dds.phyre for example;
format 8888, width 64, shift 138

But there's PTexture2DT DXT1 in the file, so delete the first 0xF8E bytes and add a DTX1 header
so like this:

```

00000   44 44 53 20 7C 00 00 00  07 10 0A 00 00 01 00 00
00010   00 01 00 00 00 80 00 00  00 00 00 00 09 00 00 00
00020   00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
00030   00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
00040   00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  00 00 00 00 20 00 00 00
00050   04 00 00 00 44 58 54 31  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
00060   00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  00 00 00 00 08 10 40 00
00070   00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
```
 (I did no correction for the values so don't blame me.)

Hey, I got find Face index and count but faild to find vertex address
Id read tut but cant understand How to get vertices address

Finding vertiesaddress are calculated or 

Looking to see what does Hexcode?

Is that right ?

Id read tut but cant understand How to get vertices addressThe tut is for simple models.

Models with (many) submeshes require advanced knowledge.

For this kind of model search for 00 00 00 01 00 02

There are 8 findings. The first to be ignored.
Next one is 0x24E22 for the first submesh.
Then 25032, 25182, 27612, 299F2

0x25032 - 0x24E22 = 0x210 -> 528/2= 264 faceindices -> vertex count= 66
----------------------
First vertex data start at 0x83CB.
0x24E22 264
VB0
0x0
0x83CB 66
1200
---------------
Next submesh:
faceindices 0x25032, 168 -> vertex count= 84
vertex addr: 0x923B

To find the 3rd submesh was a little bit harder. Maybe you should train on simpler models.
This is the face:
[](http://www.pic-upload.de/view-21676656/face.jpg.html)
0x25182 4680
VB0
0x0
0xA49B 942
1200


> Is that right ?looks like a hair/beard submesh
