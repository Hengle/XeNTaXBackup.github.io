- Post Title: NBA Live 19 3D Character Models?

Is there a way available or is it even possible to get character models from NBA Live 19? I think it's cool what they did with the celebrities and would be pretty dope to get them to go along with the celebs from 2K. Sorry if I did anything wrong here, my first post.
