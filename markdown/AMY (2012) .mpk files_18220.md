- Post Title: AMY (2012) .mpk files

So recently some of my friends got a run into SGDQ for AMY (2012) for the PS3. In an effort to figure out how the game operates (for curiosity's sake not necessarily for the run itself), we've been trying to get inside the assets for the game.

We've been able to work with most of the files thanks mainly to the quickbms script except for the collision files. We believe these are the files that are inside the folder "hkmopp", but the files have a .mpk extension that does not seem to work with any program we use for the other assets. We have tried unpacking the files with tools used for other games with .mpk files, but none of them have worked with these, which we assume are different.

Does anyone have any pointers about how these files could be read or extracted? The game also uses PhyreEngine and Bink Video. Thanks.
