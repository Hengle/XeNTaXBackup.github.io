- Post Title: HELP - The Force Unleashed 2 model ripping?

All the information I can find on TFU2 model ripping is very unclear.
Ive been trying to use the TFU_GTO_ripper, but the program appears to give me a "Run-time Error 63" after attempting to convert.
Can someone help me so I can convert GTO to a popular file format like OBJ.


Thanks,
LBF
