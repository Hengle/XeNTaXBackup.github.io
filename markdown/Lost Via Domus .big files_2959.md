Usually when nobody replies there's something the topic creator has done wrong. What have I done wrong?

Too bad I didn't see this earlier. I wrote a program to extract the audio from UbiSoft streams. It can't parse the .BIG file, but by scanning it can get the audio out.
DecUbiSnd version 0.52 (command line)
DecUbiSndGui alpha 1 (graphical user interface)
[Here](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=17&t=3034&st=0&sk=t&sd=a&start=75) is where we are discussing those programs.

I managed to download the Command EXE, but the GUI is still not available.

Like 8 hours after that post I managed to get the file. Works fine with Lost Via Domus for PC, only that plenty of files are at 33000, when your GUI says something else. Also, everything gets cut a bit before the spot where they should have ended.

I meant that your list lacked the 33000, I had to enter that manually. That's nothing wrong, just asking for new versions to add that to the list, please.

Sorry about bumping an old thread but I thought it'd be better to bring this request back rather than start a new thread entirely. 

Like JohnLocke, I'm trying to extract files from the Yeti.big file for Lost. The game splits up the assets in kind of a weird way; all the cutscenes are .bik (Blink video) files separate from the compression archive, whereas the sound files have their own .big file. Lastly all the other assets - models, textures, scripts etc - are all stuffed into the main archive, Yeti.big

Since Zench did an amazing job of figuring out the compression scheme for the sound .big, I can imagine it wouldn't be too hard to do it for the other one. Apparently Ubisoft has used their [Yeti engine for several other games](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YETI_engine), so is there some way to add support for Lost: Via Domus to an extractor? Or does a method already exist?

in reference also to:
[viewtopic.php?f=10&t=3697](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=3697)
and
[viewtopic.php?f=10&t=3873](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=3873)
I have decided to reply here because this is the only thread where have been provided some files

my doubt is about how much types of archives exist.
in the first post we have a head and tail file containing a classical "GEAR BigFile" archive (I have written a [script for it](http://aluigi.org/papers/bms/yeti_gear.bms)) but in the 4th post we have a completely different file.

now I have been able to recover that second big file on another "source" and it's format is a complete chaos, but I don't understand why the file of the first post is different.
does someone know if the archives of the Yeti Engine are those starting with the "[ GEAR BigFile ]" signature or exist others?

No, the archives don't start with this signature. Only Lost's sound.big, both yeti.big (lost,beowulf) not.
