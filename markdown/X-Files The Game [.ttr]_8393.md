These files contain graphics, not text.

Rename that files to .ttf and modify them in some font editor, such as FontLab Studio

oh... thank you all for the help. The fonts have full suport to my language. Now i'm looking for the subtitles of the game (i already found all the ingame text, except the menu). Probably they're in one of these files [.pff, .gam and .hdb]. The pff files seems to contain images, but i'm not sure. thank you.
