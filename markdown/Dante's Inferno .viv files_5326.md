- Post Title: Dante's Inferno .viv files

Hm.. not sure if I'm posting this to the right category   

Dante's Inferno (360) has everything packaged into 2 (3 for the PS3 version) huge files called "bigfile0.viv" and "bigfile1.viv"



AFAIK there is no tool to unpack these files.

I'm not sure what I can do to assist anyone that wants to give this a try but here is a file containing the first ~25MB of bigfile0.viv: [http://www.multiupload.com/IIR2BM8969](http://www.multiupload.com/IIR2BM8969)

Thank you gentlemen!

Hm, I used the search before but didn't find what I was looking for. But now I see that apparently there's a BMS script for that: [viewtopic.php?f=21&t=3972](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=21&t=3972)

Let's see if it works!
