- Post Title: Kung Fu Panda .STRM

Hello, In the PC version of Kung Fu Panda, the Level data is Stored in some type of Compressed archive, named .STR and beginning with the text mrts (STRM reversed)  (These are not .STR playstation video/music files)
Every one of the STR files seem to be one large file that is compressed starting at byte 14 (Decimal 20).
I think it uses some type of Zlib compression because the exe refers to Zlib a few times, but every extraction tool I tried does not work.
A sample file from the game is here:
[http://ps23dformat.wikispaces.com/file/view/level.str](http://ps23dformat.wikispaces.com/file/view/level.str)
And a demo of the game can be found at the official website:

Never mind this game uses the same format as Transformers Revenge of the fallen, and the program "Offzip" will decompress them

I tried OffZip, but I guess I'm too stupid to use. I can't find correct parameters to unpack it.

And what software should I use to further unpack the models?

I speak about PC version where level files are in .STR extension
