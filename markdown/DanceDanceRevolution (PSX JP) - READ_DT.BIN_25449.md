- Post Title: DanceDanceRevolution (PSX JP) - READ_DT.BIN

Hello. I'm looking to rip the characters and graphics from DanceDanceRevolution (JP) for PSX. Problem is, the game data is probably compressed into one file, READ_DT.BIN.

Is anyone familiar with the file compression used by this game (and subsequent PS1 DDR games up to Dancing Stage Fusion) and can the data be ripped?

The file in its entirety is provided in the link below, as it's the only sample file from this game.

Thank you in advance.

Hello,

I think it's feasible. I'll see what I can do and get back to you after.
