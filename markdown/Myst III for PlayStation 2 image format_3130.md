- Post Title: Myst III for PlayStation 2 image format

I'm trying to make sense of the image format used in the PS2 version of Myst III: Exile. The PC and Mac versions of Exile use JPEG images throughout. The PS2 version uses some JPEGs but most images are in another format I don't recognize. While most of the PC/Mac images are 640x640, I believe they are 512x512 on the PS2.

Here is an example image from the PS2 version of Exile:

Here's the corresponding image from the PC/Mac version:


I ran across [an article](http://www.psxextreme.com/ps2-previews/285.html) published shortly before Exile was released that gives a hint about the PS2 image format:

> This new port is being developed specifically to take advantage of the Playstation 2's unique hardware in order to deliver a port that not only holds its own with the PC version, but in many ways surpasses it. Using several Playstation 2 unique hardware features, Myst 3: Exile should look just as good, if not better, than the PC version. For instance, Presto will be taking advantage of the PS2's MPEG chipset for texture decoding, as opposed to a JPEG chipset. This should allow for fuller and more realized textures. In addition, Myst 3 will be using the Playstation 2's data streaming device to achieve faster loading times and higher frame rates. The overall result should be a game with incredible visual appeal.

Even with that hint, I haven't made any progress in understanding this image format. 

Any help would be much appreciated!
