- Post Title: Missing textures

Hi guys, I'm new here and new to this modeling stuff. I don't know where I would go with this question, but when I load up Noesis, and click a character, it shows a grey character (much like a PS2 character looks without texture) and like the title says, there's no texture on the character. Like no clothing, hair, just straight up grey character. Anyone know how to do get them?
