- Post Title: Feeding Frenzy 2 Sprite ripping (.theora)

Hello, I am looking to rip some sprites from a game called 'Feeding Frenzy 2'

The sprites for the characters in this game are packed in a .theora file, which to my knowledge is a video encoding format. I am having trouble to rip it directly from that file as I am unable to open the file, this is the problem I need help most with. Someone that has knowledge of the format that can help me rip it from the file.

This is what the folder looks like, the alpha texture is stored out in the folder while the actual sprite is stored in the .theora file: [https://i.imgur.com/QJGtFNh.png](https://i.imgur.com/QJGtFNh.png)

If anyone can help me, here's a sample of the .theora to work with: [http://www.mediafire.com/file/8g3xryx41y...heora/file](http://www.mediafire.com/file/8g3xryx41y...heora/file)

If you want other examples, here are some of the others [http://www.mediafire.com/file/t4wgtk0sb ... actors.zip](http://www.mediafire.com/file/t4wgtk0sben0s8l/actors.zip)

If possible, I am also looking to find a method to compile a set of sprites back to the .theora file where it can be read by the game. Modders seem to have a hard time finding a method to do this as well. So if anyone has an idea how to, please share.

(I'm not sure if I'm posting in the right section, if I am, please move the topic to a correct section)

Unfortunately it seems those .theora files are not exactly 'standard' and theora decoder refuses to comply on the files as there isn't even OggS wrapper on these or other standard wrapper to my eye, just theora payload as itself.

This would need a programmer familiar with libtheora to work out the differences to standard files and write relevant tool, beyond that would not say much chances to get anywhere given this is custom job by the game devs seemingly.

This is quite difficult. Do you know anyone, or know a site where I can get help from people who are familiar with libtheora?
