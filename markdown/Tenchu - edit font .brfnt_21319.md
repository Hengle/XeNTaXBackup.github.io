- Post Title: Tenchu - edit font .brfnt

Hello. I made a translation for Tenchu (Wii) into Russian, but the font for Russian letters is not displayed correctly. There is the same distance between letters and because of this, all words merge into one big word.

Please tell me how and what to edit in the .brfnt font so that the words display as it should?
I did not redraw the font, Russian characters were made by the game developer.
Also replaced it with a font from another game, everything was displayed correctly with it, but the game started only on the emulator, it hung on the console.

```

brfnt2tpl, by Atlas (exports and imports TPL files to create fonts)
BRFNTify Next, by RoadRunnerWMC (can parse and edit)
Fontifier, by Suigetsu (imports TPL files into a BRFNT)
Wexos's Toolbox, by Wexos (can preview and manage some values)

LolHacksRule, thanks. I probably need BRFNTify Next, but it's in Python, I donâ€™t know this language
