- Post Title: Sonic the Hedgehog 2006 File Conveter Request

Can someone write a convertor that will convert sonic the hedgehog 2006 files?

ex. xno, xnm, etc.

I have been wanting Mephiles' model for so long, but no one will help. I can't do it myself because I won't know coding until after I get out of college. So any help would greatly be appreciated.



PS I do not want the convertor all to myself. Please make it for everyone if you can.
