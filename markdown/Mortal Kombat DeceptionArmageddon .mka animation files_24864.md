- Post Title: Mortal Kombat Deception/Armageddon .mka animation files

I found some tools by ermaccer that can easily extract models from the PS2 era MK games, and I followed this tutorial ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnsyNedwPaY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnsyNedwPaY)). 

I was able to get the models, but I don't know how to view the animations. apparently they used a custom animation tool that uses .mka as the format ([https://twitter.com/Borman18/status/1212131880893583360](https://twitter.com/Borman18/status/1212131880893583360)).

Would anyone care to have a good look at this? I have interest in viewing any unused and used animations in Noesis, 3DS Max, or Blender.

I also shared a Scorpion animation, and his model too. Both from the PS2 version.
