- Post Title: Mobile Suit Gundam - Encounters in Space Audio

Hello, new to this forum but I am an archiver of images and audio for the Gundam franchise. In general I want to compile audio from the PS2 game and have had 0 luck in finding just where these audio files are or how they are compressed.

I have mounted the ROM's ISO and everything, have attempted to use several programs to grab the audio, but unfortunately all I get is a static garble or nothing at all. 

I am assuming that the files are being stored within this folder:



When scanning them, they grabbed the audio from a few of the FMV cutscenes. The rest of the folders look as such:



I have used all sorts of software to try and decompile any of the files, such as PSound and MFAudio, both of which have been long recommended, but I have had no luck. Any help will do really, I'd like to share these with everyone.

Just in general, I am pretty much a noob when it comes to any of this, but I am hungry to learn and get help in any way that I can.
