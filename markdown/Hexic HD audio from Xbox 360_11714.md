- Post Title: Hexic HD audio from Xbox 360

Ive extracted the wav's from hexic hd.swf but im having issues trying to get the files to play, im unsure if they are compressed, as all I get in audacity raw import is static.

Ive tried a couple of xbox 360 audio decompressors with no luck.

I have attached one of the files for anyone to have a look at.

any help will be greatfull.

For anyone else looking into this, the game uses standard XMA for its audio.

Just run the audio files (XMA) through ToWAV and it will convert them
