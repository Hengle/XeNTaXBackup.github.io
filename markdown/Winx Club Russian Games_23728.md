- Post Title: Winx Club Russian Games

Hello everybody!
I need help if possible!
A few years ago the winx game franchise launched 10 games only for some territories like Russia and Poland.
And some of these games are created with 3D models where the models and textures are in .xnb format
I have already logged on to several sites, downloaded converters and tested the ones online, but nothing so far.
Anyone who can help convert the models and textures will help a lot.
I will leave them here.
And if you know a practical method post here and who knows, you will be helping me and many other people who need the models and textures of these games.
It would be easy if these games ran on windows 10, ninjaripper would do all the work.
