- Post Title: Major hard drive problem.

I don't even know if this is the right place to be posting this, but I've got a major problem and this is the first place I thought of. I have a laptop with duel disk drive. C is my main drive and D is my secondary. When my C drive filled up I moved some important (and very large) files over to D. I also believe there's some important files that came with the computer when I bought it. I've been having problems with the computer for about the last month and last night I was downloading some stuff to the drive when my computer froze. I restarted it and went to access D drive and it said it's not formated and I couldn't access anything. When I clicked format it said that any information on it would be erased. I clicked cancel and now I'm stumped. I just used System Restore but at the beginning a message came up saying that D woulden't be fixed by the restore, and it was not. I know quite a bit about computers but nothing this major. If anyone knows what to do please help me out.

Well this is not exactly a computer tech help forum and I have no clue where you get that idea. The main focus here if you have seen is working with data extraction and modding of various games and their respective formats, the troubleshooting forum is for like bugs with MultiEx Commander and some close associates, that is this section's main focus.

Maybe sombody can help you here but these forums are not meant for these kind of problems.
