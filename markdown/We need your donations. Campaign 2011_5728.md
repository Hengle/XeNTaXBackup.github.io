As stated in the following email that you, as a member of the forum, got, you learned about our new donation campaign:

Hi Game Reseachers and fans, 

We need your donations. If you feel you should help out, use PayPal and <check picture for emailaddress> as the email address to donate to. Why? Here's the thing:

As you may be aware, the Xentax Foundation is a non-profit organization. 
Recently we are generating a disturbing increase in traffic with new forum members, hosted projects and files for download. To highlight, the traffic doubled from 30 Gb per month in December 2009 to nearly 60 Gb a month in December 2010. The latest outlook for January after one week is nearly 80 Gb! This is exceeding our traffic limits (we had to adjust the limit and invest in more traffic a couple of months back already). Furthermore, we are experiencing an exponential growth of the Game Research Forum. 

To be able to keep this site up, we will need extra funding, it is as simple as that. If not, we will have to look for ways to cut down the site. That's also a logical conclusion. 

So we call on the kindness of the community to support the site. Xentax started the Game Research forum in 2003, and in all this time we have not started a single donation campaign to keep the site online. Instead, the core members supported it with their own bucks and other means. However, if we want to keep up our ideal and uphold our Foundations' goal, we're afraid donations are going to be vital to ensure continuation at this level. 

Thanks for any support you can offer and happy researching! 

To discuss visit here: viewtopic.php?f=28&t=5728

Do look us up on Facebook as well. http://www.facebook.com/pages/XeNTaX/143458469022795

Seriously, we are growing. And with growth come investments in internet traffic, storage capacity and speed. With investment comes the requirement of having sufficient funding. In this is where the donations must come in. 

You can voice any comment or critisism, but at the end of the day, bills - our bills - will have to be paid.

Is switching host a possibility?
How much is the current monthly bandwidth & the cost?
Interested in the numbers to see how much exactly you need to stay up in your current state before I donate

Is there a particular reason file hosting isn't being done through third party sites such as rapidshare/megaupload/hotfile/photobucket as appropriate? I realize this opens a potential point of failure for a number of reasons. Perhaps using XeNTax servers as an archive would ease some of the burden: allow files to be uploaded as usual in order to maintain a reliable source, but encourage offsite hosting for day to day heavy lifting. If a file goes missing, someone could search the archive and re-host it.

Also,

> Interested in the numbers to see how much exactly you need to stay up in your current state before I donate
This. I don't mind chipping in, since this site has been very useful to me, but not if the situation seems untenable.

I wish I had some money to donate...  

How long do you plan on this campaign lasting, and do you have a target figure in mind?

As far as third-party file hosting is concerned, obviously I'm not Mr.Mouse or Craptain, and so can't comment definitively on the matter, but I'd suspect that the reason all files are hosted on-site is that they aren't immediately aware of any third-party site which would offer us the options we need for hosting.

Now for a technical note, a little (more) bottom padding on the donation banner now appearing on every page would be nice.

When I made that comment, it hadn't occurred to me how much content actually IS being hosted through third parties already. So.... yeah. :\

Indeed, if you browse through the forum, you'll notice that a lot of people already use those 'free' hosting sites, and in fact, forum attachments are only allowed to be 256Kb in size, so bigger files will have to be presented at third party sites. However, tools and other type of software is stored by us, to ensure it is save and not resulting in 404s whenever some third party decides to remove files. 

We're currently looking into the needed figure here, but as we are in an exponential phase we will have to keep track on events to see what traffic is currently needed to cover it. 

An important aspect is that we've got a good relationship with our current host, and we've always been able to settle things in good faith and understanding. We're positive we can come to a satisfactory agreement with them. But, as said here, if there is a better deal elsewhere to be had (less costs, same or better hosting) then we'd have to consider moving the site there.

Can you just give us some base numbers to get a rough idea of how much money I should donate?
What do you normally expect your hosting to be?
How much extra traffic have you received as of late?
How much has it cost you so far to buy extra bandwidth for this month?

That sort of detail is important. Hopefully your hoster can cut you a deal, your site is one of the few dedicated to game file format research and it would be a shame to see it cut back or worse yet disappear. I've been a long time lurker and whenever a new game releases this is the first place I go to see if the formats are posted.

Hi2All 
I seen cool thing - non-commercial site arjlover.net distributing a lot of huge video films by simple ways - direct links from many own servers through balancing php script, ed2k-links and torrent - can you do like this ?
I think its own traffic very small

I personally have little I could possibly donate as I too have bills of my own to pay and I already work 2 jobs to manage those. But I have thought of the problem this discusses.

We're using more bandwidth now than you have ever used in the past. Now I will not say I'm incredibly useful myself in comparison to other members here who are far more experienced in reverse engineering, but it seems quite apparent to me that there is a large increase in new members who are posting in the 3D Model Format Research section simply to ask for 3D models from _____ or other trivial questions that could easily be answered through a simple Google search.

A large majority of these new members seem to be registering and posting in the 3D model section soley to ask for models from _____. They aren't asking specific questions on formats or anything as the section is intended to be used but rather they just ask for pre-converted models and where they can get them to download. Or so this is how it appears to me as of late.



So to me the problem appears to be  that many people are registering here with the wrong idea of what the purpose of the site is, and it seems that many of them have a general attitude of wanting to receive without providing anything in return.

Now this isn't the case with everyone but it seems very common as of late. So I think  a possible solution may be to simply hide the forum topics from view to non-registered/logged in users. In effect this would prevent us from showing up in Google as much and in turn it may significantly reduce the amount of people who misunderstand the reasons for Xentax's existence. And then direct them to find other places to ask their questions where they would fit better than they do here.

I understand there are definite downsides to this but it is one way I can think of to reduce not only the spam but also the bandwidth used and in turn the money bandwidth requires.

There's also the option of closing registrations but this would harm the site even more I'm sure. After all you never know when the next reverse engineering guru will show up and want to contribute.


Just stating my thoughts.

You are spot on. Our analyses shows that only as little as about 30% of all registered members ever posted anything. That must mean - as downloads are only for registered users - that 70% just come in to download and not contribute themselves. However, I must state that there are and have been many people that have frequented our forum for years, with 0 posts, but tried to learn as much as they could. We have a number of primary goals, and one of them is to be able to share knowledge. We would like to have information as open as possible. To close down a site by preventing registration is therefore not an option. To hide forums is also not an option. But SHARING does mean something. It means two-ways communication, instead of just taking from the Xentax community. So perhaps we are back with the option to make stuff only available for download for people with more then, say, 10 or 20 posts.

Although I don't think anyone on my forums on my website, and thanks for hosting my site, have really uploaded any files directly onto my forums, I have recently changed the abilities of people with a low amount of posts.  No longer can someone with 0 posts download anything.  But as I said, I can't really recall any files being attached to my forums, and most people leave links to free hosting sites.  Also, I have made sure that all files I make available are hosted off-site, to save you bandwidth.  I feel bad and wish I could donate for the cause, but I am basically jobless right now, and I am not really making any money from my projects that I charge for.  Right now, I'm more afraid of losing my house, than losing the website.

I did recently make a Cafe Press store to sell T-shirts, I doubt I will make one penny, it was made more as a joke than anything else, but if I get any money, I will try to share any profits I make.  Here is the store: [http://www.cafepress.com/XboxHackingPortal](http://www.cafepress.com/XboxHackingPortal) 

Here's an example T-Shirt (talks about the SvR2011 patch that was worthless):

i agree that understanding the philosophy of XeNTaX is important, and that instead of funding expansion with members who will contribute nothing (70% is quite large   ) we could use this opportunity to fulfill its purpose a little more.

the registration process could expand on the "reason for joining" to list some of the common reasons for joining, with a small paragraph on alternatives, or suggestions to what they should try first..

Example:

> > I wish to download a file
>
> Have you checked the Tools Blog? You can often download files from the blog without registering!
>
> 
>
> > I wish to learn about file formats
>
> Excellent! You should first download our Definitive Guide to Exploring File Formats!

by redirecting these visitors, the tools blog and wiki might see a rise in usage from members uploading their tools or updating the wiki with format information. however, page views or public "thanks" might be needed to understand their usefulness a little more.

public comments encourage spam
post-count requirement before they can download also encourages spam

THIS IS MADNESS!!! Madness huh? THIS IS XENTAAAX!!!!!!!

Seriously, this is madness, I mean - requesting for donations this way. This forums has "only" about 6 900 members, most of them are inactive, and registered only to download the topic attachment or just to have account here, but doesn't visit this forums everyday.

Even if every registered user visit this forums everyday, it won't take so much traffic as you described. I know that xentax also hosts some files, but they are rather small files and can't take such amount of traffic.

I think that if traffic increases so rapidly, as you described, it's not because of forums and increasing number of members, but rather someone's leeching your files and is trying to halt the server that xentax's running on. If you want to decrease traffic, you should use some anti-leech download script, and control all download - that would limit number of downloads per IP/Member per day/week/month. Files (probably) takes most of the traffic, so it would definately help you keep Xentax running without any donations. 

Implementing such PHP script is easy, I wrote a one by myself, which I'm using on my website. It logs every single download, so I can also generate from that a download statistics and ban all IPs that are leeching.

Also, most of the donators would donate only once and only a small amount, so it won't help you much if leeching would continue increasing.

I hope that this criticism doesn't offend you or anybody somehow, I'm just trying to suggest how to keep this site alive without donations (while I'm in bad mood).

--------------------------------------------------------------
This really reminds me the wikipedia's "smart" move - requesting for donations in way that if people don't donate, wikipedia will shut down. They got over 15 million dolars this year, every year they increase "requested" amount of money, and what new we get for that? simply nothing.

Nice rant, but let's look at the Kilobytes of traffic generated by the different forum pages being loaded in December. 

```
6086338 11.09% / 			
5502153 10.02% /viewforum.php 			
4166194 7.59% /ucp.php 			
1190957 2.17% /forum/viewtopic.php 			
1134286 2.07% /download/file.php 			
955745 1.74% /forum/viewforum.php 			
816188 1.49% /forum/download/file.php 			
718637 1.31% /style.php 			

```


This comes to ~33 Gb of traffic and 60% of total traffic in December 2010

For comparison this was around 16 Gb of traffic in February 2010.

If I may say a few words...

I see that javascript files are getting gzipped before being sent across the wires, but that's about it.  Could you possibly ask your hosting company to reconfigure Apache to also gzip php files for your site?  It can easily be done and would save you (and them) quite a bit on bandwidth if they can spare the small increase in cpu useage.  The prezipped files get cached anyways so this increase is quite minimal.

If they do not want to go this route (I don't see why they wouldn't), you could at least remove the whitespace from the html or css that's getting served, either directly in some of the phbb files or through some magical plugin if one exists.  I'm not very familiar with phpbb, but there may be some useful caching/compression addons to help with the bandwidth.  The other thing they could do that might help would be to add expires headers for static content that isn't very likely to change, that way browsers are more likely to cache it.  

Having stricter limits on avatar and signature sizes may also help a bit, and force people to compress their images a bit more if they want them hosted on your servers.  Someone also brought up a good point earlier, and it may be worthwhile to sift through your server logs and determine if any ddos attacks are contributing to this increase in bandwidth usage.  There's also the option of splitting up the forum/blog/files hosting into separate servers/providers.  Depending on the usage of each, it may be more beneficial to go that route instead...

Also, if you don't mind me asking, what is your current hosting setup and costs associated with it?  I'd prefer if things were more efficient before donating, as the money would then become more useful that way...

Yes, there are still some, look at the google ads bar above if you go to a forum. 

I checked the logs and there are no DDOS attacks, there's just a lot of forum activity. I did add some bots to the robots.txt file, just to be sure to get rid of those I saw. You must realize we use a lot of images and stuff at this forum. A post with an image of 42K that has been viewed 186 times results in 8 Mb of traffic if not cached properly by a browser. This is just one example. We have many images, attachments and so forth. We have 300 Mb worth of files in attachments alone. And a lot of times people already link to other image sites and download sites. Our attachments are restricted to 256 Kb. 

Stripping code to remove whitespace is a seriously large task, IMO.

I definitely would be against any type of ads since preservation of site integrity should be a common theme that separates you from other such outlets.  Accepting donations yearly/bi-yearly and/or getting a cheaper (or donated) host are always better options for practical results.

Additionally, going "off the grid" just to minimize user-base and conserve bandwidth is generally NOT a good thing.  I say this with conviction based on personal experience from my own half-hearted game development community forums.  Yes, you would definitely see a decrease in overall traffic and thus users who just leech your content, but you'd also see a decrease in the ever-so-often intelligent researchers and developers that might frequent as regulars and help expand the core concepts I'm sure you started this site for to begin with.  Besides that, if your bandwidth isn't largely coming from file downloads and more-so from script requests, I hardly think THOSE users are to blame since they probably just register, visit the site once, get a file, and then are gone forever.

If you are only tipping the scales in the 80GB bandwidth range, you shouldn't have an issue with a solid shared hosting package at a dozen locations.  I use [dreamhost](http://www.dreamhost.com) personally and before they decided to tag themselves as "unlimited" bandwidth, my static number fell in the 2TB a month range -- of which I managed to tip a quarter of on a couple months.   More importantly in the case of an active forums like this would be CPU usage (since it's a shared box).  No, I cannot fully guarantee that you wouldn't use a gargantuan amount of CPU for your forums; however, I can say that I too run an old phpBB2 forum with a few thousand users and somewhat similar activity levels as this one without any hassle.  It would certainly be worth a shot and a worthy investment to give them a try.

Then again, I AM one of the described people who basically was dropped a link for this site by a non-english-speaking 3D artist I hardly know in an effort to help finish up some code for conversion of an obscure file format.  The only reason I'm really writing this post or even remember this forum is primarily because I found an email relating to donations being requested.   While I only have $1.73 in my Paypal (which I could still donate if need be),  I'm not against donating bandwidth, file hosting, or site backup/mirroring (which would probably be detrimental in your current state). 

At any rate best of luck finding an overall solution.

Yes, the core concept is "open". So to put too many restrictions is not an option. 

We are currently working on possible deal with our host. The problem with "unlimited" bandwith is that a lot those companies do limit the bandwidth when things get out of hand. At the end of the day, someone has to pay for it. 

If others like hostgator, or dreamhost (any others?) can offer the same stability for less, then we will certainly be interested to move.

Okay, we've struck a deal with our current host for the time being. The total amount of donations we received at this time is 35 euros. Many thanks to those few members for the support! As you can probably imagine, that won't last even a quarter of a year though, but it is most certainly welcome and helps.

GoogleAds? They account for nothing. Nobody clicks on them. Don't forget this is a community of usually intellectual people programming and modding that are probably not easily lured into clicking on Google Ads.  And while we have thousands of members, there is a hard core of much less. And not everyone is in the position of having money to donate, or don't want to, or couldn't care either way. Also, a lot do not have Paypal, so even if they wanted to they can't. Well, not true, but I haven't exactly got a Donation page up with help on how to do it, either. We have a bank account number though, see [http://www.xentax.com](http://www.xentax.com) and then the About page.

Heh, that's the first time I'd actually looked at that page; I didn't realize I was on the Xentax Foundation board...  What is the IBAN number listed there?

Mr.Mouse, have you looked at [Rackspace](http://www.rackspace.com/)? I'm not sure how their pricing would compare with the current host/plan, but they claim 100% uptime and Mojang seems to have decided to switch to them for Minecraft...

There are much cheaper hosting solutions.  Not sure what you are currently paying but this provider has reasonable prices and from what I have heard is a great host.  

[http://www.hawkhost.com/Shared/compare](http://www.hawkhost.com/Shared/compare)

If that doesn't work, then there are 1000's of other providers offering shared hosting.  Or you may consider a VPS, though can be more costly if you are not familiar with running your own server.

It is fair to donate. The people of this community long used to decrypt files to others. When I have time I can donate.

Es justo donar. La gente de esta comunidad emplea mucho tiempo en descifrar archivos para los demás. Cuando tenga tiempo donaré lo que pueda.

@Crypton You are totally wrong, Man! Xentax.com has its own reputaion increased, now it can not go downward hosting their file to rapidshare. I admit that leeching can be controlled by PHP scripts, that is a good way to decrease traffic. But Xentax must go for donation. 

@Xentax.com Answering all forum question and helping noobs is a great work! Keep up the good work! You must set your goal of donation you require for maintaining your website annually.
Set the goal please, So people can donate. I will also post this to my 12000 youtube subscribers.

I love Xentax.com

Thanks for the thumbs up. Yes, I agree we should set a donation mark. We will do this in due time. This year, we will be safe, looks like. I will have to see how it develops. I will let you know.

> Indeed, if you browse through the forum, you'll notice that a lot of people already use those 'free' hosting sites, and in fact, forum attachments are only allowed to be 256Kb in size, so bigger files will have to be presented at third party sites. However, tools and other type of software is stored by us, to ensure it is save and not resulting in 404s whenever some third party decides to remove files. 

We're currently looking into the needed figure here, but as we are in an exponential phase we will have to keep track on events to see what traffic is currently needed to cover it. 

An important aspect is that we've got a good relationship with our current host, and we've always been able to settle things in good faith and understanding. We're positive we can come to a satisfactory agreement with them. But, as said here, if there is a better deal elsewhere to be had (less costs, same or better hosting) then we'd have to consider moving the site there.

Oh wow.  I wish I had been around before you renewed your contract with your present host.  They charge much too much I think.  Especially considering the site latency.  I've had a few different hosts now.  It;s difficult to find just the right one.  I'm very happy with my present host.  Going on 3 years now.  Excellent priceing.  Efficient servers.  The guy that runs the place works very hard and has an amazing rep on some of the major admin sites.  You should check his company out.  [MDDhosting](http://www.mddhosting.com/hosting.php)

Something else you should consider.  As much as I am surprised to read myself I think you should reconsider google ads...  I fought tooth and nail against doing this on my own sites with the co-owner of my sites but when I finally gave in I saw how worth while it was/is.

My biggest issue was exposing our members to dreaded ads.  I found a way though to only show the ads to guests.  Anyone logged in doesn't see ads which made me very happy.

I checked your stats and you can easily make $10 a day by putting 2-3 ads on all pages.  To guests only.  Not an exaggeration.  More likely an under-estimate.  If you'd like some help getting things implemented feel free to ask me.

We actually used to run Google ads on the wiki, but (at least in my experience) they never seemed to work properly.

- Post Title: Re: We need your donations. Campaign 2011

I had a similar experience at the start.  We gave it a try at first about 2 years ago and got minimal results.  Like 5 cents a day or something, lol.  So we gave up on it for a long while but after many months we tried again and saw much better results.  It took a while for the revenue to "warm up".  A month or two maybe but after that it was well worth the effort.  Another thing is that our wiki gave great results but our forum was giving squat.  It might be the inverse here.  Maybe more guests visit the forum here than the wiki.  It all comes down to where your traffic is the most.  Oh and google rewards based on page views as well, not just clicks, so if you were getting nothing when you tried then you might have missed a bit of code somewhere.  We did at first.  I think we had the tracking code wrong or some such thing.  

If your host provides Cpanel then check out your awstats.  Better yet...  Get an [Analytics](http://www.google.com/analytics/) account.  Either one will show you where your traffic is the most.  Analytics is much less server intensive though since it's run offsite.

P.s.
Interestingly enough I just checked your stats from the link at the bottom of the forum, OneStat.com and sure enough almost all the traffic is to here at the forum.  Just under 94%.  So it's no surprise if you had minimal success from wiki ads.  Which is promising news in fact.

Those are great tips, but when I said "the ads never seemed to work", I mean they literally always seemed broken. I don't know if this was just a problem with my computer, or if it had to do with how they were installed, or what, but I don't remember them ever even appearing (and before you ask, this was before I knew enough to use ad blockers or script whitelist extensions or anything of the sort... back then, I had AV/anti-malware programs, and that was about the extent of it).

Back to your tips, keep in mind that while I have server access to the wiki, I don't have similar access to the forum or main website, nor do I have access for the old Google Adsense account, the OneStat account, or even XeNTaX's account on the host site (I've never actually asked for said access, but I'm not actively interested in it (definitely wouldn't mind having it, in part or in whole, but not actively interested  ), and certainly wouldn't blame Mr.Mouse and Craptain if I did ask and they refused).

Ah ok, I see Dinoguy.  Well it looks as though you've been very involved here and certainly you have some experience with the process.  Now I'm not sure if I just didn't notice it before but I just noticed a link unit near the top of the site.  It's interesting that the ad type is a link unit.  That link unit is exactly why we initially stopped using google.  It is probably the worst paying of all of them and is exactly why it's at the bottom of the list of units to choose from.  What's important to know is that each and every unit pays differently.  Google won't share exactly how each unit pays but within the list there is the Recommended units.  

I assume Mouse is reading this topic so here's what I would recommend to get comfortable.  I didn't want to do this at all when we started so what my partner and I did as a compromise was that we put a Leaderboard unit at the bottom of all pages on our sites.  That way it wasn't too intrusive and we could watch results.  The results were good enough that we wanted to add more in a smart way.  Keep in mind that while unit types pay differently so does the placement of the ad.  Naturally, top side pays more than bottom.  There's a grid that Google supplies depicting the value of several locations within a page.  

As for my experience.  Leaderboard, Text and Image units are the best.

Very nice.  Give it a month to do it's thing.  Oh and set yourself up for direct deposit.  We lost a check in the mail and there was no way to get the lost money back.  Some scoundrel intercepted our cheque.  It's a regular problem...  Google cheques are not a good idea, heh.

Back on the topic of donations I thought I'd donate a little something.  While working I tossed together a favicon for you guys.  I noticed you didn't have one and thought you might like one.

We do actually have a favicon, as seen on [http://www.xentax.com](http://www.xentax.com) - , but it hasn't been readded to the forum or wiki since we were attacked a few months back (and I'm not sure if it was created specifically for XeNTaX or picked up from somewhere, since I've seen it used on one other forum, completely unrelated to us(though I don't remember what forum that was)).

I think that favicon was included with the theme I based the homepage on. I don't remember designing that.

I talked to someone who has experience with this type of thing and have plastered some key areas with Google text ads. Only for non-registered users of course. I have good expectations, but we'll see.

As an aside, this required a core hack in phpbb, which is completely ridiculous.

It is impossible to work with phpbb. It has a cache that you need to clear twice before your changes become viewable. There isn't an option to disable caching, so development becomes an unnecessary pain in the ass. "Plugins" are all core hacks that overwrite key files, just like they used to be when we had to manually edit the core. The only difference is that they automated that process, which of course doesn't work because it depends on search & replace, which ties them to a specific version of phpbb.

The thing I don't get is that instead of learning, they opted to stick with their shitty code and expand it. I swear to God I have never seen a group of people pursue a bad software design strategy as aggressively as the people behind phpbb.

Maybe that would explain why development has seemed to slow exponentially over the last few (all bugfix >_> ) releases (or is that just me, and their development pace has always been slow as hell)?

That would be a likely explanation. It's definitely not a project I would want to contribute to.

Do donations of a decent size (don't want to state publicly how much for fear of Mr. Mouse getting flooded with requests) merit a bit of priority on research for specific games? I'm a long time modder, but now that I have a career and a family I have resources to donate towards research - game archive research specifically. I know money talks in the sense that I'm sure this question is asked fairly often, but I just wanted to throw it out there in case I get to make a request with a higher donation.

Well, no. At the moment, higher donations will not prioritize any specific game to be researched. That's the way donations work. However, there will be some pros here probably that may be "hired" to take a peek at a specific game. However, if those tend to be more frequent, we might be considering to ask for a share, or donation in return. Might.

Please forgive my ignorance but I was unable to find a link to click on to donate money.  I've been using your forum for about half a year, registered for less, but I've come to greatly appreciate what this forum does for the community.  Oddly enough I am only a user, I spend most of my days in statistical programming and have yet to learn how to explore game data.  
Regardless I want to help make sure that this forum stays active, there have been several forums I wanted to access but they were no longer available due to increased charges.

If someone could kindly direct me to where I can contribute (I assume through paypal) then I would greatly appreciate it.

[edit] oh my bad..

If you look at the actual [Rising Kingdoms](http://wiki.xentax.com/index.php?title=Rising Kingdoms) wiki page, you'll notice that there is no MexScript for the format yet. It's important to keep in mind that just because a format is on the wiki does not mean it's supported by MexCom (and, particularly with stuff over the past few years, the converse is also true).

Yes, all who donate and make themselves known at the forum get a Friend of MultiEx tag and star. They must specifically post or mail their usernames at the forum and email address they used to donate, we'll not do an email compare automatically as many use different addresses for forum and paypal.

I kicked in a small amount for now. 
I know it's not nearly what is needed but I will add more when business gets better.
e-mail on the donation is privateer at gmx.us

Well, the donations we got this year have ensured we're good to go for another year at least, if not more. So that is reassuring  Thanks to all who donated or helped out in other ways!

I'll be glad to donate more when I can.
I'm just wondering what the VIP and Stars are for?
I didn't expect anything for my small donation.
I just felt since I'm learning so much here, I needed to donate something.
Could I just be put back to the standard stuff?
I don't feel I earned anything like a VIP or Stars to be honest.

Thank you Mate.
I know it may seem a trivial thing to some people.
I however prefer to earn a star and such outside of any donations I may submit.
As I don't get paid for what I do for fun, earning things is what I consider my pay.
