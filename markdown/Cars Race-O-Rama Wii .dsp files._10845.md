I've been trying to get some .dsp files converted into either a .mp3 or .wav format, but there is no program that has what I need. The link below is carrying one of the folders carrying this file. Any help would be nice.

I tried it before, didn't do me any good, not unless I had a tutorial how to properly use it.

Ok, it turns out that the .dsp files I'm looking for are from a .arc file. I used Arc Extractor to get the files, and as I tried vgsconverter to convert them, they got the "file isn't supported/doesn't exist" message. Maybe's the .arc file needs further searching.
