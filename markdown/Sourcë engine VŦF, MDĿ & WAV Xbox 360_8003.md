Hello, I have been trying to convert PC format files for the Sourcë engine to the 360 version (specifically WAV, MDĿ and VŦF) with no success.
I'm fairly sure that both the MDL (model) and VTF (texture) files are compressed using LZMA, but other than that I have no idea.
As far as the audio files go, I don't have a clue other than that I think it's XMV which I've read is the general 360 format.
Any help converting from PC to 360 is appreciated and I have attached files from both 360 and PC versions of Team Ƒortress 2 to this post.
