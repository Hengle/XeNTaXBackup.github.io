The meshes are straightforward.
Upload some textures for the monsters that you've uploaded.

Also, are there equips and some characters?

The main file that connects everything together is an xml file.
Which means for type-checking, we'd have to first check the contents of the xml file to verify that it is related to lunia in the first place.

While xml parsing is easy, checking it is annoying since there's no guarantee that some xml file from another game won't be using the same structure.

But after that it's easy.

No textures are loaded because I don't use the xml file.
The correct way to load the model is to open the xml file for that model, which will load the meshes, materials, and animations.

The UV might need to be flipped.
Or...maybe it's just low-res.
