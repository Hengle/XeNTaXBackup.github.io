The game seems to use unity however encrypted. Please moderator no need to remove link, we are talking about a free to play game. 

Please provide some data sample ( not whole apk )

Data sample? Sorry I dont really understand. The apk is just called Rage Of Demon King apk 1.0.5 which you can find on google, but it seems encrypted and I really want to decrypt it somehow
