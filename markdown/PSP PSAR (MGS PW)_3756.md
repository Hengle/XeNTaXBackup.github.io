So seconding this. PSAR seems to be some PSP update archive, and it's encrypted/compressed, don't remember which one it was, but there are some unpackers on the net but they don't seem to work. Can't wait for the music here.

the structure is deff not a psar, I used a pbp unpacker on the demo and then a 5.50 psar decompiler on my psp.  if you look at the psar in a hex editor, it says UMDIMG (UMD image?) or something of that nature. I think it's something completely different from a standard eboot psar, probably something specific for demos.
