Is there any automatic way to compress/decompress it (except manually adding 4 0x00 bytes)? Or I should rather ask: Is there a way how to convert 32bit interger to 64bit (and vice versa) in QBMS?

Bro it's your lucky day. 

This software is super easy and are use on most youtube video you see where they edit their CSV files. 

[http://cocdevforum.ml/showthread.php?tid=26](http://cocdevforum.ml/showthread.php?tid=26)

It only has 3 options:
 0: Uncompress .csv files - first asks for source and destination directory, then decompresses all files in source and writes the results in destination
 1: Compress .csv files - like the first one, but compresses files
 2: Exit - Quite obvious
