- Post Title: RE6 [PC] .WAV problems

Hi everyone. I'm looking for help with the voice files from RE6. I'm trying to create character voice packs for the RE6 character skins in L4D2, but i've hit a road block. I've extracted the audio from .spc format, but the .wavs I get sound strange.

Extracted .wav: [https://www.mediafire.com/file/9ws0se1r ... 5.wav/file](https://www.mediafire.com/file/9ws0se1rbvlid2s/5.wav/file)  (What all the wavs sound like after extraction)

Anyway to have it sound like it does in game?

What did you use to extract them?  It looks like the sample rate is incorrect.  It should be 32,000 by the sound of it.

Hi DKDave. I used this tool: [https://residentevilmodding.boards.net/ ... sound-tool](https://residentevilmodding.boards.net/thread/15557/mt-framework-sound-tool)

Nvm a friend is helping and turns out the pc version is the best one to use instead of the xbox one.
