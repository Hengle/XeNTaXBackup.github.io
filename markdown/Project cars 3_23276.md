Hi! Anyone found a way to extract the models from Project Cars 3 yet? If so, could you (one who knows how) make a model request if possible? I need in a few models (jaguar xj220s racing, chevrolet c8r, aston martin vantage gte 2019) out of that game!

Thanks in Advance!

Similar to the first part. But 3d max doesn't open the model.

Hi,

Can anyone help figure it out.
These are the car files Acura NSX racing 1997 and Chevrolet Corvette C8r from "PS4".
[https://sharemods.com/tl3vvn3atq0u/Test.zip.html](https://sharemods.com/tl3vvn3atq0u/Test.zip.html)

But they do not open in SMS import.  Try to open. Previously, models were usually opened. What could be the reason?

Replace first 12 bytes from each .meb file from any .meb file from pC2 or Shift 2. But don't try to import tires - script won't import them.

Hi, help me please. I now unpack BFF files, but textures in format TEX (about 3000 files).
How can you convert them TEX to format DDS?  they don't open ...  
Also do they have the wrong names? Is there a script to rename them to the correct names?  
Thanks

You can get textures by using Ninja Ripper. I tried and it gets the files. Textures are ok but models needs to be fixed.

How convert .tex into .dds?
1. Download HxD Editor (for example)
2. Drag on drop .tex file in HxD
3. Remove everything before .dds
4. Save on open in Photoshop.

Made tools for unpacking PAK & TOC with path names, and decrypting MEB.

Made tools for unpacking PAK & TOC with path names, and decrypting MEB.
Is there a way to extract in a batch, as the tool is hardcoded to NOT accept usage like the following

```
for /r %%G in (path_to_game\*.bff) do <tool.exe> <options> "%%G"
```

or

```
for /r %%G in (path_to_output\*.meb) do <tool.exe> <options> "%%G"
```

If i where to extract based on a TOC, it will not allow "-o <path_to_output>" that's only allowed only while using "pak" and you must select only one *.bff at a time.
Decrypting "*.meb" in a batch its impossible as well.
Individual paths for each asset must be provided.

Unless i am missing something very obvious?


Also some *.meb assets like the attached one throw the following error:

```
   at PCarsTools.Model.MeshBinary.Load(String fileName) in C:\Users\nenkai\source\repos\PCarsTools\PCarsTools\Model\MeshBinary.cs:line 62
   at PCarsTools.Program.DecryptModel(DecryptModelVerbs options) in C:\Users\nenkai\source\repos\PCarsTools\PCarsTools\Program.cs:line 145

Made some fixes.
[https://github.com/Nenkai/PCarsTools/releases/tag/1.0.1](https://github.com/Nenkai/PCarsTools/releases/tag/1.0.1)

No output directory for TOC handling is intended mostly due to how Project Cars GO works (where all files are not packed, but encrypted/compressed in-place).

Hi Nenkai,

I replied to you at github (MikeVapour).
Thank you for the quick fix: the PC2 files unpack now correctly and there is no garbage data at the end of files.

I was wondering if you would look into making PC3 files compatible with PC2/AMS2. The conversion of tex is handled by headercutter.bms script, but PC3 mebs have a slightly different header (more data) compared to PC2/AMS2.

PC3 typical headers:
```
00 00 C0 01 00 01 10 00 00 00 00 00
```

PC2/AMS2 headers:
```
00 00 00 01 01 00 00 00
```

When it comes to tracks, I suspect there is a problem with .sgb64 files. Looking at process monitor I don't see AMS2 loading it. Asa result you end up "in limbo" with the skybox only. Ai go on about their business but the wolrd is missing. This happens even when I edit meb headers manually, replace bmt with mtx and tex with dds.
Is it something you could look into? I've exhausted my skills on this.

Hi! I used these snippets and they're work. Just save as .cmd/.bat files, place it in the directory where .bff / .meb files are present and launch.
Make sure you have a correct path to PCarsTools.exe and game directory.

```

```


```
for %%a in (*.meb) do "C:\PCarsTools\PCarsTools.exe" decryptmodel -i "%%a"

```

Bumping this
Hi, is there a fix for the tire models in PC3? I've examined the tire models in hex (with a PC2 header, decrypted with PCarsTools) and they have about the same structure, but it looks like it has some extra data shifting everything. This appears to only apply to the new cars in PC3; all the reused cars work fine.
