- Post Title: anyway to get Destiny models from Last Gen yet?

hey guys, I know there has been now solution for this yet but the reason I ask is because the enemy characters (namely Skolas, Aksor, and Taniks) are just one of those things I've been wanting to have models of for quite some time, and it seems people have given up on trying to extract anything from destiny anymore, so if some one has an answer to this question I'd like to know so please tell me

No because the compression algorithm used isn't released publicly.

Like ghostblade said it's using the oodle compression and it is not possible to do anything with that as its not public.

According to [http://www.radgametools.com/oodle.htm](http://www.radgametools.com/oodle.htm) you can get SDK, if you willing to pay of course.

The SDK is ridiculously expensive to purchase.

Just for the record, [QuickBMS](http://quickbms.aluigi.org) 0.7.5 implements the APIs OodleLZ_Decompress and OodleLZ_Compress of Oodle 2.2.0.
