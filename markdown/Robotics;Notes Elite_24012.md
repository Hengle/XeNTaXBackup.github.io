- Post Title: Robotics;Notes Elite

Hi, I have been trying to extract the 3d models for characters from Robotic;Notes Elite, I have tried many things but all have failed, I am new to game modding/mining/exploring, so any and all input is appreciated!
I extracted model.cpk from the game files, it gave me about 280 more cpk files
extracting 1 of them just gave me a file with no particular format (the properties just called it a 'file')
when I tried extracting some of the cpk files with vgmtoolbox it gave me a bunch of .bin files that I had no idea how to view in a cad software
I found a script ([https://zenhax.com/viewtopic.php?f=5&t=2745](https://zenhax.com/viewtopic.php?f=5&t=2745)) for noesis which was supposed to help extract the 3d objects, but it worked neither with the .bin files nor with the .cpk file, it straight up did not accept the .bin files as an input and it gave me this error-

I hope someone here will be able to help
Just to clarify- I will be using the models for my personal use and not infringe on the game maker's copyrights
