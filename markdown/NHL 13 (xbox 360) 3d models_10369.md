Hello everyone! Im posting in regards to something ive been struggling with for the las few months. I have an EA Sports NHL 13 iso and I would like to extract the model for my favorite player, but I havent found any plugins for any program and Noesis is not very helpful-ive extracted the contents, but cant open anything. So im wondering, is this actually possible to do or am i just wasting my time?
