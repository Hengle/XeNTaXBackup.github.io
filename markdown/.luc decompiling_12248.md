- Post Title: .luc decompiling

Hello!
Anyone can take a look on this files?
It's indefinitely must be a some sort of lua compiled script, but i can't find the decompiler...
I've tried luadec, but it don't work for this files 
These files where unpacked from Farming simulator 15

You could try replacing

```
00000 1B 4C 4A 02 00 47 44 3A   .LJ..GD:
```
 (not sure, the "D:" might belong to the following path)
by

```
00000 1B 4C 75 61 51 00 01 04  04 04 08 00 48 00 00 00   .LuaQ.......H...
```


(0x48 = 72 dec. is the string length of the path including the "terminating" zero.)
Not sure about the EE 08.

```
00020 75 69 6C 64 2F 66 69 6E  61 6C 62 69 6E 2F 64 61   uild/finalbin/da

00050 72 2E 6C 75 61 EE 08 00  11 15 00 22 00 43 E0 02   r.luaî.....".Cà.
```


Sadly this results in an endlos decoding loop when using ChunkSpy.
Same goes for unluac:
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space

edit2: ok, there are differences between Lua and LuaJIT opcodes so the above simple approach can't work

edit: decompiling features/lua functions from the lucs seems to me a waste of time (didn't try harder)

My suggestion would be to search here for mods which might have the lua files/features you want:
[http://www.farming-mod.com/category/far ... ator-2015/](http://www.farming-mod.com/category/farming-simulator-2015/vehicles-farming-simulator-2015/)

I checked Scania R730 Forest And Trailer V 1.0 and found some lua (= plain ASCII) files contained.

btw: is there an SDK with a lua compiler to create lucs (with this strange header) from lua?
(From what I read I assume it's possible to use mods with uncompiled lua files.)

First of all, thank you for your attention!

I've found that these files are actually contains the bytecodes, compiled with LuaJIT.
If someone have an interest, here is the project page: [http://luajit.org/](http://luajit.org/)
So, this is explanation for the unusual header.
I was able to list code from the files, here is an example:

```
0001    GGET     1   0      ; "ipairs"
0002    TNEW     2   3
0003    VARG     3   0   1
0004    TSETM    3   0      ; 1
0005    CALL     1   4   2
0006    JMP      4 => 0013
0007 => GGET     6   1      ; "fileWrite"
0008    TGETS    7   0   2  ; "fileId"
0009    GGET     8   3      ; "tostring"
0010    MOV      9   5
0011    CALL     8   0   2
0012    CALLM    6   1   1
0013 => ITERC    4   3   3
0014    ITERL    4 => 0007
0015    RET0     0   1

```

(From what I read I assume it's possible to use mods with uncompiled lua files.)

Actually, these files where unpacked from the game client and contain developer objects.
Looks like they was compiled for performance measures, not because of security.
In mods we can use simple lua files, written in plain text.
But i'm working on mod, that must change some developer values, and making it without understanding of what actually all these files contains is the real headache 
So, somebody have any suggestions about how to convert this bytecode in something "human readable"?

You could try this tutorial: [http://www.progamercity.net/ghack-tut/5 ... ripts.html](http://www.progamercity.net/ghack-tut/5296-tutorial-luajit-decompiling-lua-scripts.html)

After 4 min I got a little bit bored and jumped to the end of the swf video.
Seems he could reconstruct 6 lua lines or so.

Good luck.

This is exactly what i need!
Sadly, but looks like my mod should wait, while i trying to write some sort of re-assembler for all this stuff...
However, your assistance was really helpful, thanks again!

This is what you need 
[Lua VM 5.1](http://luaforge.net/docman/83/98/ANoFrillsIntroToLua51VMInstructions.pdf)
I am currently doing this for 5.0
It is the most boring thing I have ever come across.
