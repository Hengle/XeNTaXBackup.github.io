- Post Title: forza 3 textures??

where are the textures located for the models once extracted from the forza disc or dlc,ive managed to get the models to pc,then into max and then simed,but i can only find a handful of textures,nodamage.xds ect,and a folder called shared which contains a few .xds,but not enough to do the complete car,interior ect,is it a case of creating new textures and mapping these models?
forgive my noob questions

general textures were posted in the Forza3 mesh extraction research topic, page 8, by sommergemuese.

about the rim textures, they are in a separate folder. I don't really know where, but if you find it, could you hit me up with a PM?
