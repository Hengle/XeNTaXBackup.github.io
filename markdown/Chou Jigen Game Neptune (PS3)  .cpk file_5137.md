Several .cpk files cant extract:

(data.cpk, graphic.cpk)

event.cpk cannot unpack(on my system quickbms see APPCRASH).

Other .cpk files normal unpack. I use this script - [http://aluigi.org/papers/bms/cpk.bm](http://aluigi.org/papers/bms/cpk.bm)

Files, which cant unpack - [http://ifolder.ru/19603825](http://ifolder.ru/19603825)

Sadly the graphic.cpk and event.cpk are the only 2 I really want. I'd like to extract the 2d character images and album pictures.
It seems there are also .pssg files inside which I cannot open.

The file is compressed use "CRILAYLA".
Here is my program. But you need to modify the program to put file in DirName.

sorry, but your program is working only with the same cpk files as quickbms with the certain script and crashing with the rest of cpk files as the quickbms do - so, is that prog really have some advantages over quickbms with the cpk script?

The UTF content is encrypted. This code can decrypt it. But decompress failed ...

```
{
	u32 m, t, d;
	int i;

	m = 0x0000655f;
	t = 0x00004115;

	for(i=0; i<length; i++){
		d = buf[i];
		d = d^(m&0xff);
		buf[i] = d;
		m = m*t;
	}

	return 0;
}

......
	if(*(u32*)(cpk_buf+0x10)!=0x46545540){
		decrypt_cpk(cpk_buf+0x10, 0x62800-0x10);
	}
......

You can try TiledGGD.

PSSG used not pictures only, but and for 3d graphics(models, animation).

Hey, sorry to bump this, but the cpk unpacker doesn't work on the object.cpk file from Trinity Universe, which I assume holds the model files.
