Hey, 

I'm looking into this Terraria game, which seems like an 8-bit version side-ways scrolling Minecraft clone. Anyone to recommend it? [http://store.steampowered.com/app/105600/](http://store.steampowered.com/app/105600/)

At out Facebook page Aaron Bennett thinks it sucks.

A bit late, but yeah... I strongly recommend Terraria. I actually like it much better than Minecraft. Feel like I have an actual goal.
