- Post Title: [WII] Just Dance 3 - .bf file

Hello, I'm new here...I came here from Google search when I was trying to open a JD3 file where the extension is ".BF"
so check it:
[viewtopic.php?f=17&t=7489](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=17&t=7489)

The first post said:
"Hi, I have extracted some wave file from JD3.wii.wav.bf of Just Dance 3 Wii version.
For extract wave I use FileStripper, but I can't play the file."

How exactly he made it?
There are a lot of app named filestripper, I tried but didn't work.
So how to open/extract the Just Dance 3 Wii .bf File?

I trying a lot, I think I got viruses while trying ._.
Anyway, that's not a problem.
I downloaded some files and Quick BMS codes, all .exe won't work, weird seems to be a problem in C redistributable here or wrong use method. and Quick BMS does not do their job on JD3.

Thanks for attention.

JD3.wii.wav.bf (406MB)
