Here is a plugin for noesis that supports xpr2 files.
if you find a xpr file that does not work just upload it somewhere and let me know ill add support for it.

Thank's a lot but it doesn't work on RE:ORC for 360 like the above msg, 
here is the message from Noesis

and here is another file (hunkgear_s.xpr) if it's possible for a fix

Like I said in the ORC thread the old ssg script could produce corrupt data. Go get the new script and reextract with that.

I used
def hackLoadRGBA(data, texList):
   w = 256/512/1024/2048
   h = 256/512/1024/2048
   fmt = noesis.NOESISTEX_DXT5
   data = rapi.imageUntile360DXT(rapi.swapEndianArray(data, 2), w, h, 8 if fmt == noesis.NOESISTEX_DXT1 else 16)
   texList.append(NoeTexture("hacktex", w, h, data, fmt))
   return 1

And always diffuse are wrong or not reading at Noesis :/

Ð¡hrrox, could you please add support for NeverDead .xpr transparency textures? .xpr normal maps works great, don't know why these ones are not. Here are some samples.

chrrox - I would be very grateful if you could add support for the xpr2 files from EA MMA for xbox.

Rename that crap as xpr and use tecmo360texturesExtractorV15 by bony, It supports xpr. Then the files exported just add a .dds extension and you're done.

Edit: the normal bump is an ati2 dds texture, convert it to whatever you want with noesis if you have some problems.

Darko - Thank you and AceWell so much for the help! It's working perfectly. Really, I can't thank you enough. I'm a modder, but I also train jiu-jitsu so most of these MMA guys are people I've met and look up to! For example, Fabricio Werdum and Roger Gracie are heroes of my sport   

You've made my weekend! I hope yours is great too.

I'm trying the xpr script on NBA Jams On Fire textures (xbox360), but its not working. It makes a file, but its just all black with a few random artifacts. I extracted the graphic files from an AST file with quickbms and NBA Jam AST script that aluigi wrote: [http://aluigi.altervista.org/bms/nbajamfire.bms](http://aluigi.altervista.org/bms/nbajamfire.bms)

It wont let me attach anything bigger than 200kb, so I uploaded an example file to my work server here:
[http://premieronlinevideo.com/stuff/nbajam-graphix.zip](http://premieronlinevideo.com/stuff/nbajam-graphix.zip)
. Looking at the header in Hex, it shows XPR2. I'm real close here and very interested in finally adding some new skins to NBA Jam. Any help is greatly appreciated.

hi chroxx, 
 Can you check this type of xpr? its from EA game Fight Night Champion, i used your script to open the file in Noesis, it can open but the result is just single color.
 Please help me with this.
 Thanks a lot

i think chrrox abandoned support for this script years ago    

i made an adjustment to it on line 49 that uses the header size so it 
will go to the start of image data, before it was just using a fixed value
and started reading at the wrong offset when there is different header length.

NBA Jam on what platform? 
that doesn't look like a xpr2 format, looks more like the PS3 gtf format i just made a script for here   
[viewtopic.php?p=123791#p123791](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?p=123791#p123791)

add a gtf extension to your texture files and use that "Shift 2" gtf script.

the script works with your sample it just chokes on the comma and quotation mark at 0x361
and 0x362 when reading the string names, you can just open the sample in a hex editor and
replace those characters with an actual letter to allow the script to keep running.

Many thanks   
But it is possible to fix Noesis Script some way to all the textures of the game, there are too many files that have an error ...
It would be too difficult to correct each one manually.
