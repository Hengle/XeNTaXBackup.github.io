Hey. I was wondering if there was anyone who can help me unpack this DFS to get the model? Or direct me to the tools needed to get into it? I was going to try Daz Studio, but I've read that it didn't work in the past. PSXPrev can see the textures, but not the models. Thanks ahead of time for any help. Cheers!

Hi, you can try quickbms [http://aluigi.altervista.org/quickbms.htm](http://aluigi.altervista.org/quickbms.htm)
with this script [https://github.com/bartlomiejduda/Tools ... script.bms](https://github.com/bartlomiejduda/Tools/blob/master/NEW%20Tools/Bust%20a%20Groove/Bust_a_Groove_DFS_script.bms)

DFS files are containers for TIM (image files), SEDT (audio container) and DBI files.
This script will extract data without filenames and it will try to guess correct extension.

And here's file format:
