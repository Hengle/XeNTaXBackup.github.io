- Post Title: Open game file formats?

If we have learned anything about game file formats, should we create open file formats for engine and game devs? Compare mp3 versus ogg as example.

The file format should be modular - e.g, not everyone needs RPG stat block.

Game rendering has improved too - what kind of set of data is needed when artists makes an object to game.

Etc.

(I have decoded Oblivion and Fallout 3 esm/esp file formats extensively, if you wonder what I have done.)
