- Post Title: 3dz file format.

3dz is 3d format used by Microprose in their famous simulations. 

I wanted to give a link where download of 3dz Studio Beta2 could be found.  [http://www.acesovergyn.hpg.ig.com.br/ac ... Viewer.htm](http://www.acesovergyn.hpg.ig.com.br/aces_over_gyn_Viewer.htm)

In the package, among many cool little utilities and programs,  one may find full specification of 3DZ file format as well as source code of the viewer/editor. It may be handy for someone knowledgeable enough to put it to use of making converter to more popular 3d formats. 

This is special request addressed to Zoltan Karpati who is frequently guest on this forum. 

PS. Still working on putting together spec for TAW "3" files , but meanwhile I thought about that 3dz above.

Strange, I have full access to download link. Can you see Studio Beta2 hyperlink 1/2 down the page? Anyway I downloaded the Studio file package so if anyone interested I can e-mail directly.

Perhaps the site was abandoned and noone is now to correct the problem caused by sudden visits to this "sanctuary".  But that proves my point that many potentially interesting things can dissapear or become forgotten in the vast  space of internet. 

Good new is that I have secured the said 3DZ Studio file with all its attachement by downloading it yesterday. I will post that file Monday somewhere for pick up.

Again, if I may, I would like to alert Zoltan Karpati to see this package.  Possibly materials contained there could be sufficient to include 3dz format into his nearly universal 3D Object Converter. 

Also they could serve as an template  how the format of the possibly new 3D file needs to be described in order to be included in the converter. The 3dz format is now obsolete, as the company MPS is also defunct, but they used this for variety of their games which are still quite popular.  

I am also thinking about gathering materials for "3" format (TAW) and "3dg"(Jane's F18 - LODs and write module)  in the similar fashion.

Zoltan comes frequently to this forum which is very good thing. 

Thanks anyway for posting the link to his 3DObject Converter. His Project is becoming one of the most prominent and universal conversion utilities around. IMHO it could be even more popular with modders, if it include more 3D materials and formats of old games.  
That is where and why I bug in   .
