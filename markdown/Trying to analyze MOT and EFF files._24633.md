- Post Title: Trying to analyze MOT and EFF files.

Hi. I'm trying to analyze two different file types for a game I'm trying to translate from Japanese to English.

These are MOT and EFF files, and I think the MOTs are animation files. However, everywhere I look, it's for 3D models, and the game I'm trying to translate is a 2D Platformer, written in HSP.

Thanks in advance.
