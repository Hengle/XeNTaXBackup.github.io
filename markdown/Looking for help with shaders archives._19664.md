- Post Title: Looking for help with shaders archives.

Hello everyone. It's my first post on this forum.

I wanted to ask about unpacking Metro game shader files.
How i can unpack them? They're in specific format.

```
shaders.dx11_ultra_tess

shaders.dx11_vhigh_notess
shaders.dx11_ultra_notess

```


Files are from Metro Exodus, but they're also in Metro 2033, and Metro Last Light. 

If someone can help, i will be grateful. Thanks.
