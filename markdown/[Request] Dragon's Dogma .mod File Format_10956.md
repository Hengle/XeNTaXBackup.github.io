- Post Title: [Request] Dragon's Dogma .mod File Format

so it seems that .mod file format is different from any of the -let's say- Resident Evil Games but to my knowledge
the same engine, isn't it?
i can't wrap my head around the fact nobody has released a working importer for 3dsmax, noesis or blender.
is that .mod format really so hard to break up? i'm not a coder myself so i wouldn't know.
what i know is, the models in this Game are amazing quality for a console game and it's a shame
we can't get our hands at the those.
anyways, i added an extracted .arc file from one of the enemies ingame with all the .mod, .tex and converted .tga files 
for you guys to have a look at.
cheers!

i'd love to see this happen. and i bet i'm not the only one. 
i thought i'd give this another try after almost two months.
there's so much potential for artists and modders with your script.
i know coding and scripting can be time consuming. even more if you aim
for at least decent quality and a clean script.
long story short, if you have the time and still got some motivation for this project,
you would make a lot of people more then happy.

I'm working on a ripper for the PS3 version of the game, but I'm warning you guys, the textures are SHIT quality LMAO! PC games from 2001 had better quality textures than this game. The format is indeed reordered from RE6, but it is practically the same with an extra section of unknown data related to customization.

That's funny, I just finished my script for Xbox-360 version of the game, but since you're going to release ripper for PS3 version, I guess there's no need to post it here now lol

P.S. And I guess, format is more like Marvel vs. Capcom 3 than RE6 version

oh wow! that is great news.

could you be so kind and release it?
it never hurts to have some variety. and since yours is even finished now.
that would be really, really great.

as for the textures, actually they're pretty decent from the xbox360 version.
i've added another sample to look for yourself. 1024x1024 for most of the textures.

Okay, so here's maxscript to import models from Dragon's Dogma/DD: Dark Arisen (Xbox-360, I think PS3 version should work too  ) I wanted to clean script a bit and to test more models, since I didn't have much of them, but now it's up to you I guess.

Edit: A bit updated script

[](http://piccy.info/view3/6059200/c54038cca1e10ab4cb6148f4e4d7392e/orig/)[](http://i.piccy.info/a3c/2014-03-13-13-58/i9-6059200/744x574-r)

P.S. And as a note - you will need 3ds max 2009-2011, 2012 too I think - because them I'm using and script will crash in newer ones. Also, if there will be any problems with model import feel free to report it here (in case if Howfie will not release his tool earlier  ).

cool, very nice. looks good . i've got plenty of other stuff to work on so it's nice to see some new blood on these forums working on multiple games.

on ps3 textures are not even close to 1024 x 1024. for example, model\pl\f\f_base\f000\f000_body00_BM.dds is only 512x512 and f000_face00_BM.dds is only 256 x 256.

Thank You!
The script is stable. But I have a problem extracting the textures.
I use ArcTools 0.9.26. This soft incorrect extract some normal maps from DragonsDogma (Xbox).
If use "-texRE6" - created only txt file, without tga;
if use only "-tex" - maps incorrect;
Sample:

How unpack *.dlcp (HD textures from Dark Arisen)?

Speak of the devil, I just replied to your thread on FP because I couldn't find this either.

Said script seems to be for the PS3/360 version though. However, I did find this link in another thread (I'll post this in your FP thread as well) that apparently does work for DD .mod, so maybe try the MT_FRAMEWORK.ms from it and see if that works.

also If you need test file from DD pc port head here [http://sta.sh/0157ac8xgojt](http://sta.sh/0157ac8xgojt)

Sorry to bump this thread but I don't really know where else I could ask. I tried opening those models in max with the script but I either get an error or nothing at all.

i don't know anything of the models and i know there is tools to convert the textures but i made Noesis python script to open the .tex file samples you have just for kicks

supports dxt1, dxt5 and rgba32
i guess those are from PC version? 
i translated the C# code from this source to Noesis python api and added 3 more format IDs not in the source
