- Post Title: 무혼 (Muhon) *.msh *.cnt *.ani File!

Hi everyone！
I found a game that I loved very much when I was a kid!
But it died a long time ago!  
This game is from 2002，Died in 2008，The game has been resurrected  
I want to make a game mod，Rich game content.
But I found that only the dds format file is a known format!!!
Can you help me make tools for editing models and animations


The model is rough！But still like this game
