- Post Title: Transformers Universe VOs and Music

I've tried looking for the music files for days, I haven't been able to find them. Transformers Universe is a unity browser based game (with a downloadable cilent [https://www.transformersuniverse.com/download](https://www.transformersuniverse.com/download) ).

I find it strange how the files end up in C:\Users\[username]\AppData\Local\Jagex Ltd\Transformers Universe

Instead of in the Program files or the Program Files (x86) like other games.

Also in this location: C:\Users\[username]\AppData\LocalLow\Unity\WebPlayer\Cache\Transformers Universe\

There's folders with randoms string of letters and numbers, inside these folders are files which could be the audioclips/Voiceovers I'm searching for.
And I've no idea how to open them, can anyone please help?

I can't seem to attach the file to here, so I've uploaded one of the files over here:

Each of the "file" in each folder came with an info file:
