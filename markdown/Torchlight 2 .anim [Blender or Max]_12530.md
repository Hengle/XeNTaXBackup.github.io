- Post Title: Torchlight 2 .anim [Blender or Max]

Hello there! I'm just wondering if anyone knows of a way to import extracted .anim files from blender. I know you can use OgreTools to import mesh into blender, but there is no animation support. Anyone have any ideas? 

Note: I know FatImporter works, but the animations are jittery when imported into 3DS Max. I'm just wondering if there's any other alternative.

It is a tool for import anim files.

Anim files works only with this tool, because i created this 'anim' file to control which animation i want to import.
In most cases skeleton file is a container for many animations.

Here is importer for Torchlight 2 for mesh, skeleton and anim files
It requires Blender249 and Python 26
