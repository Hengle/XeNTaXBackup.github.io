- Post Title: [BattleBlock Theater] Modifying the BAF files

Hey, I've been looking for some way of modifying BattleBlock Theater's (Steam or Xbox, doesn't matter) BAF files, but I have not had success. I have used Dragon UnPACKer's Hyperripper to get the DDS files but I have no way of putting those files back into the game. See, I got a BMS script to decompress it to a .dat file and put that through Hyperripper. That has allowed me to access the textures but I don't know how I would go about putting the modified file back into the BAF file. I am not the most intelligent person around, and am VERY inexperienced with this kind of stuff. Any help with this would be appreciated, thanks!

It would be like, really cool if you posted that QuickBMS script
but you probably won't given the fact that you've been inactive since 2017   
mostly replying in hopes that someone else has the script 
i guess we'll see though

Heyo, I was wondering if anyone could help fix the above mentioned script to work with Xbox 360 .baf files?

I tried asking about on the Zenhax forums a while back but the most that came of it was adding "endian big" to the script, but we couldn't figure out the right format from there.

Any assistance is greatly appreciated! 

Below are some baf files from PC and Xbox360 versions of the game to compare and test with:
