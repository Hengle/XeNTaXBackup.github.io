Cut the file and upload it.

brres or something no?
A lot of the wii games use it, with the extension .pac
there's a lot of info on the format, i wrote a dumper. but never wrote a full out extractor.
There was no point, no ones looked at the *.mdl and the *.tex (which seems to be some form of *.dds)
Heh, if someone could get the model/texture format down pact, i wouldn't mind coding for this ^_^.
Then again, i'm sure there are much more eligible coders here :).
