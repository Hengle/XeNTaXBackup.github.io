- Post Title: I need help extracting models with their bones.

I am trying to get a Flan from FFX. I have the X/X-2 HD Remaster on Steam, because it is on there I can't use 3d Ripper DX to extract the current pose of the flan, instead I used ninja ripper. The model came out in T-Pose. I tried using 3ds Max to add bones and pose it myself, but I am running into a lot of issues I can't seem to fix. Is there a way I can extract the model and the bones from the game? Also, I am a complete noob at this. Any help would be hugely appreciated.
