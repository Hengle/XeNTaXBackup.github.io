- Post Title: How do I view this online model offline?

I downloaded the file of [this model](https://www.artstation.com/artwork/3LBbA)(scroll down and press play) using developer tools in Chrome, it's SCOUT_Norwood_Mech.mview, it's 5.3MB.

But in which offline software can I now view it, especially with different modes(topology in particular) that exist in the online version?

No, that's not helpful because I already extracted the file without these instructions.

I'm looking for a software that can view that extracted file, could Maya view it maybe?

You may read and try or not. (I can't promise that it will work because the formats on those art sites may change.)

I simply "extracted" the 3D data as wavefront object files using hex2obj.
(2 submeshes with 1200 vertices and 89 vertices:)

Wow, that's a lot of work for nothing, it's a dead topic with no actual solutions that consistently work.

Btw, do you know where I can find models exclusively viewable in such a way, instead of just pictures?

Blaming people is a bad way when asking for help. I won't support such an attitude.

Wow, you would disrespect one of the most helpful member on this forum. 

So I followed his advice to read the links and was able to unpack the files and load them into 3dsmax and blender. You didn't read the links and you're still stuck. WOW

I already said that I have Maya, not 3DMax or Blender.

Can you [upload the zipped files](http://www.tinyupload.com/) ready to be imported to Maya?

Thanks.
