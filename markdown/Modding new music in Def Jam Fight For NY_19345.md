- Post Title: Modding new music in Def Jam Fight For NY

So, I was wondering if I am able to mod in music for DJFFNY. I have the tools to extract the .mus files, after extracting the .mus file they turn into .asf files and then i use another tool to convert them to .wav.

I was just wondering if there is a tool that can turn .wav files to .asf and from there it turns them to .mus.

Also I would like to know what does .mpf files contain.
