This is a pack of .ogg files ( [http://www.vorbis.com](http://www.vorbis.com) ). 
It looks like it is in a set format. 

Get the attached mc.mrf file and overwrite the one in the MultiEx Commander\data\config directory. 

Now in MultiEx Commander you can choose :

Sherlock Holmes :TCSE

To pick your file, first type *.* to show all files, then select the .EN file. 
(This is because there's still a bug in MultiEx Commander, that does not show files with shorter extensions than three, silly me).

That's right. There are no filenames saved in the archive.
