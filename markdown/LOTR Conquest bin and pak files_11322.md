- Post Title: LOTR Conquest bin and pak files

Hello,

I'm starting a thread in this forum for help with extracting the level bin and pak files from LOTR Conquest (pc version, but xbox would also be awesome). I understand that you can use ninjaripper to get textures from the game but I'm really after a full extraction of the pak and bins.

I would be immensely grateful for any help.

There was never a PC demo, so not sure how to post samples without breaking the board rules.

No files, no help.
