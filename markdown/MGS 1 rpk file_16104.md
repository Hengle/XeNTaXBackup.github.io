- Post Title: MGS 1 rpk file

Does anybody know how to open/edit this file? Tried with [http://aluigi.org/bms/exanima.bms](http://aluigi.org/bms/exanima.bms) but nothing is extracted. I don't know what it is.

[https://www.dropbox.com/s/8477tknt0b77a61/item.rpk?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/8477tknt0b77a61/item.rpk?dl=0)

It's from MGS 1 PC.

Thanks!
