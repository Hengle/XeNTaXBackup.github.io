- Post Title: cysp to json

I am trying to get .cysp from PrincessConnectReDive to .json so I can read the time frame of each motion.
It seems like .cysp is a spine file from [http://esotericsoftware.com/](esoteric)
There is a php script from [https://gist.github.com/esterTion/e24d7 ... e586ce5235](https://gist.github.com/esterTion/e24d7142e0fa0bcc6ef11ee586ce5235)
but I can't to seem to get it right
The author explain that the project is discontinued and suggest me to go to spine-ts for local previewing.
But, I don't think spine-ts allows me to get it into .json file.
