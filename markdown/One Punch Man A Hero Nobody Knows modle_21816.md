The pc version of the file is encrypted, all garbled, who can extract the file, ps4 is not encrypted, the model file format is npk npki npkv

Use the Cmp Scz bms script on the pc files. [http://aluigi.altervista.org/bms/cmp_scz.bms](http://aluigi.altervista.org/bms/cmp_scz.bms)

And read this thread to know how the meshes work in the npk, npki formats work. [viewtopic.php?t=20760](https://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?t=20760)

Yeah sorry I thought that the files that someone gave me were from the PC version.
You're better of with the PS4 files since there's already a working tool for them. [viewtopic.php?f=16&t=21725](https://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=21725)
