ubulk alone is not very useful as like it's name implies..
it just holds the bulk of the data in RAW form but all the relevant info necessary such as headers are not held in it which is necessary for any kind of extraction process to be done properly.

Besides these are 'compiled' files, you can't import them back into unreal engine as the process is only one way and if you only have compiled files you'd need decompile them via umodel etc to get the raw source files again for any import.

Thanks, if I upload ubulk with uexp and .uasset, can it be exported and imported??

I tried looking at it quickly, there is wav header for microsoft adpcm in uexp but I am unclear how exactly it is splitted bytes wise as my attempts to fuse the header and the raw data give just noise.

I'm sure somebody can figure it out in long run to find the right fields for offsets and such so single sample is bad for comparisons.
