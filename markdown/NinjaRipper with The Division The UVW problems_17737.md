- Post Title: NinjaRipper with The Division: The UVW problems

Hi guys, 
First of all, my English is bad and i'm totally new to 3d modeling and i'm crying out to call for your help.

I have ripped some 3d model from The Division and imported to 3ds Max, it looked nice, but the texture wasn't.

The unwrapped UVW map looks like this:


All of the vertexes, polygons are literally on a flatline, and I cannot figure out how to fix

Used 'Auto' UV importing method. Any help are welcomed. I can give a whole ripped scene if you need.
