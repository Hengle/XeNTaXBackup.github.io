A guide can be found inside the folder explaining all the details as well all of the tools.
If you have questions you can ask them here in the topic.
Have fun translations

UPDATED 1.1

I updated the vageditor due to not finding all the vags in some LEVEL files, this now should work with all the languages;

Also updated the tool for the XA, where a voice part of Merlin goes mute and bugs out. The new tool is a differente XA extractor and packer and works better;

If you are going to edit the voices I recommend you doing from the English one, the others have some pitch changes happening in real time ingame.

Hi,

Thanks so much for this toolpack.

I wanted to try and use it to extract the Monster's Inc Scare Island files which I believe are very similar.

I tried to change the decompress.bat files to match the Scare Island level .bzz files, but when I used toolbox.exe the resulting data folders were empty.

Do you know whether I could use this pack to extract Scare Island .bzz files and ultimately textures?

I'd be very grateful for your help,
Thanks,
Seb

Hey, nooie!
This toolpack only works with Bugs Bunny Lost in Time on the PS1 version!
Still working on a PC version so I can check what is possible to modify and not.
About Monsters INC I have a tool that can decompress the BZZ files, but compressing back isn't perfect yet since it gets bigger than the original.

You can extract the textures easily on the PC version of Monsters INC Scare Island. Just open the BZE file with timviewer or tim2view.
