- Post Title: Tron 2.0 DTX/LTB

I have 2 different file types and I have been trying to find a program to convert them with the only thing I have been able to find is something that is a paid addon for Unity. Here are a couple sample files. I would rather not use Hex2OBJ as I still have no knowledge or interest in trying to figure all of that out to convert every single model.

i made a Noesis script that opens your dtx sample since finale00's script didn't work with it

Here are a few more DTX files. Along with a few more LTB just in case. I've tried to download the scripts from that thread which was linked but none of the webpages seem to work. Also tried the LTB scripts for Noesis from the Himeworks webpage but had an error on trying.



Sorry would have uploaded this here but the max file size on the site is 256kb.

All of those new texture samples are dxt5 and work with the current script.
all of your model samples except for BASE_GENERAL.LTB work with finale00's ZuOnline_ltb script here 
[http://himeworks.com/redirect.php?type= ... Online_ltb](http://himeworks.com/redirect.php?type=noesis&name=ZuOnline_ltb)

i think BASE_GENERAL.LTB may be animation files or something

Because your sample file just contain bones + anim, no mesh so that's why finale00's plugin didn't work
You must try the Tron_tools instead
