- Post Title: Various Unknown file type from extracting Tales of Xillia

I'm researching on ripping models from Tales of Xillia PSP game and I found this thread: [viewtopic.php?f=10&t=7330](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=7330)

I extract the .TLDAT file in 1sec and stop to preview. Then first I got various Unknown file type, such as:

There maybe alot more file type if I continue.
Just only the .TOTEXB that could be extracted to .dds

So please help me, I'm a newbie though. My purpose is finding the model file and see how to rip a PSP game, since I love this game character.
I'm willing to study more even if it will take long time.

Thanks for any help

Just so you know you can probably guess what some of those are:

BTLCOL = ???
BTLDB = ???
CHRDAT = ???
FPSDAT = ???
TOANIMB = Animation?
TOHRCB = ???
TOMDLB = Model?
TOSHPB = ???
TOSHPP = ???
TOSHPS = ??
TOTEX = Texture
TOTEXP = Texture?
