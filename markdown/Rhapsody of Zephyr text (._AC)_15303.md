- Post Title: Rhapsody of Zephyr text (*._AC?)

Hello everyone.

I'm trying to translate Rhapsody of Zephyr from Japanese to English, but the apparent files with the script appear to be compressed and only display gibberish if checked thorugh a text/hex editor. Anyone has a clue if it's possible to decompress/decrypt them?

Here is a bunch of _AC files. Let me know if I can provide anything else.

Thanks in advance!
