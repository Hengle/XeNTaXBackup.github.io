Michelin Rally Master: Race of Champions

Hi guys, can anyone tell how to see the 3D models of this game?
The game is from the year 2000, it came out for PS1 and PC.

I have checked the "Data" folder, and I suppose that everything is there, unpacked, but there are several types of file and I do not know any of them, nor the program with which to manipulate them.
These are the formats I can see:
.PDO (with Paperkura it fails and being a file from the year 2000, I doubt that it is the same format)
.PDT (These are the "clues", as I can read)

Attach some files: PDO, PDT, 1 DTA file, and a DLL

I have placed the files Hierarchically ...
I hope they help

Thanks a lot!
