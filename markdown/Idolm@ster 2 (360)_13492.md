By dumping my 360's RAM I was able to retrieve some unencrypted model files for this game, but while the skeleton and texture files are the same as the first game (.skl, .num, and .nut aka NTXR aka texture.nmd) and have [max scripts to open them,](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=4814&start=15) the geometry file changed from NUP3 to NDXR (they're both called .nud in the games' files, but it seems that it's convention to call NDXR as model.nmd).  Because of this change, although there are some preexisting tools for handling .nmd files, I can't figure out how to properly open the complete model.

If you expect help you should tell the whole truth.  

This seems to be another tristripped model where it's tedious to find the submeshes:

By running the bones script and then the bones2 script on 3DS Max.  I linked to the topic that has that information, as well as included the scripts among the sample files.

Some more examples: [http://mfi.re/?16wn222el3merzz](http://mfi.re/?16wn222el3merzz)

I finally got my hands on some files from Tekken Tag Tournament 2, which is what *.nmd support in Noesis is based on.  I found that the reason why these nmd files wouldn't load is because they're missing 16 bytes at the top of each file.  This bms should fix that: 
```
endian big
get name basename
string name + "_fixed.nmd"
get size asize
putVarChr MEMORY_FILE 8 size long
append
log MEMORY_FILE 0 size
append
math size + 16
log name 0 size MEMORY_FILE
```
But the problem still stands that I have no clue how to apply the bones.
And if I want the model with the textures applied, I have to combine the NDXR and NTXR files with [mergenmd](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=9645&p=78885#p78885) and then open the output in Noesis, but mergenmd often doesn't do the job correctly.  I don't know whether this is because of the missing bones or if it's because these files come from a different game...
