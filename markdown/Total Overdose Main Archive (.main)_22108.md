- Post Title: Total Overdose Main Archive (.main)

Hello everybody,
I was able to convert the games .naz archives with this tool:


 naztozip.zip
Converts .NAZ files to .zip (5.86 KiB) Downloaded 10 times


found here: [http://www.ctpax-x.org/index.php?goto=f ... 64&lang=en](http://www.ctpax-x.org/index.php?goto=files&show=64&lang=en)

Within the folder directory of BLOCKS.NAZ i found a file called overdose.main
DOWNLOAD LINK (8MB):
[https://we.tl/t-bJqJa1ZfYP](https://we.tl/t-bJqJa1ZfYP)

Since all other files are mission scripts, loading screen texures, sounds and map files, i hope for 3d models to be inside this archive.
It would be great if ya'll could have a look at it 

Peace

I Found documentation about the game engines architecture on moddb.com

Kapow Systems 3D:
[https://www.moddb.com/engines/kapow-sys ... chitecture](https://www.moddb.com/engines/kapow-systems-3d/downloads/kapow-sustems-3d-architecture)
(Supposed to be a modified Version of renderware engine)

(Hope this helps)

The only other game on that engine that Made it to release is watchmen: the end is nigh
