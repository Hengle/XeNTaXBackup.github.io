for file all.xcd for change texts -> use an hex editor like Hex workshop, find the test and change it, remember is in unicode mode (letter, bit 00, letter, bit 00, ecc). For each text is important to maintain the last bits; ex. 0119 or 0112 (but i'm not sure how and what them are in this moment)

for font.xcd -> uses an English vocabulary, no use of accents but only apostrophes in place
