- Post Title: Ripping models from atari battlezone?

I was wondering if it was possible to rip models from atari battlezone arcade game. Even though it uses vector graphics, it uses vertices to tell the code how to draw tanks and things, so I was wondering if you could use modern tools to take the vertices and convert them to 3d format. Here is a page I think you'll find helpful in doing this. [https://6502disassembly.com/va-battlezone/](https://6502disassembly.com/va-battlezone/)
