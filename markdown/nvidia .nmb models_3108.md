- Post Title: nvidia .nmb models

Ive looked and I know that there is no converter or any plugin for any 3D software like max or maya for importing .nvb models from nvidia's tech demos. There is however one converter but for some reason its only for one of nvidia's demos the dawn one. Here is the site to download it from 
[http://www.geocities.com/dawn3dmodel/](http://www.geocities.com/dawn3dmodel/) It converts the model into a bunch of obj. models. I tried it with the other demos and it wont work. Is there any way to view the code of the .exe like some sort of extractor that extracts the code from so I  can see how it was made so I can try and modify it to work with the other demos? Or if any one here knows how to make importers (either for max 9 or maya ) or custom converters could you do this please?

Long time ago, there is a full document of nmb format at:
[http://www.epita.fr/~bilalt_j/graphics/](http://www.epita.fr/~bilalt_j/graphics/)

I'm not sure if it still there but you might try some cache engine to find these document!

There's an old (very old) extractor still available here:

[https://www.geocities.ws/dawn3dmodel/](https://www.geocities.ws/dawn3dmodel/)

however it doesn't seem to work with newer versions of windows
