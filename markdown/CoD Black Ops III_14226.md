Immediately I apologize for my bad English, but need help.
Have already passed 8 months, and the author of the program [Black Ops II Sound Studio](https://www.itsmods.com/forum/Thread-Release-Black-Ops-II-III-Sound-Studio-1-5-2.html) do not update tool. The basis of the program are no all have file names.
Can someone write instruction, how to manually get the names to the audio and bind with files that you extracted through this tools? If possible.

Here's a image. It shows that the names of the files in there, but not all. Possible audio names are in another place. Elsewhere, there are files with the same name but with a different extension -- [http://www41.zippyshare.com/v/5hZNF1js/file.html](http://www41.zippyshare.com/v/5hZNF1js/file.html)
