- Post Title: Open files from ps2 DVD

I wish have some 3D models from a ps2 game,
I try to open it but the files i want is hidden from disk...
So i search how i can do, then i find a way to open it...
1)i take my original disc an convert it on a iso
2)open the iso with  the nova estractor....

So now i have 4 files from the disk:
0001.form
0008.form
0009.form (can i open by winrar, but useless)
0010.psb (can i open by winrar, but useless)

So, now what i have to do to open these files?
The files 002->007 are pss/mpg video files, so i skipped it.

But of these i dont'know how i can use it 

Probably "form" and"psb" are a wrong extension, 
How i can find what is the right estension name, and open it?

If you can opening it with WinRAR, even if it useless, that's mean so archives have some known compression (e.g. Zlib) and unpacking will not hard. 
Provide samples of some files.

Ratchet & Clank 3

The files that i can open contains also hidden files, 
i cannot estract that, the visible files are useless.

The form files are 1.70 gb each, the psb file are 874mb.
I think is too big to attach here.

Ill' try zlib.

So I have to try out with a hex editor...
Now i cut the first 4 rows and search 
about that to find out what format is.

Right? Hope it works
