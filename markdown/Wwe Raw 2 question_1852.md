The names of characters are indeed stored in caw.bin,
i dont know any editor yet that might be able to edit them
except for using a Generic Hexeditor, then just scan the file
with your eyes and edit the parts you want =D

it should be pretty easy, if you are used to hexxing.

The names are in there, use this script in MultiEx Commander

```
GoTo EOF 0 ;
SavePos ASI 0 ;
GoTo SOF 0 ;
Do ;
SavePos FO 0 ;
Set FN String .DCOM ;
Get F String 0 ;
String F += FN ;
Log F FO Size 0 0 ;
Math FO += Size ;
GoTo FO 0 ;
While FO < ASI ;

```


This will extract the DCOM files (I think that's what they are for each character). The filenames are a bit screwed, that's how they are saved in there. 

Get the ready-to-use BMS below. 

The TOC from MultiEx Commander:
