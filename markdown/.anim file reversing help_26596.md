Hello! I need help for export key animation from .anim files plz.
I have 2 animation files from GravityRush 2.
"Stay open", "Stay close"   and   "Open" of TreasureBox model. 

This model has 3 bones.  Root, Lit and Base.
This  .anim files are very small   1ko for "Stay close/open" and 2ko for "Open".

In "Stay close/open" animations bones dosent change position and rotation.  (only 1 frame ???)
I chose intentionally 3 small animation file, but i have found only one useful information at 14 bytes  = count of bones for sure.     
at 30 bytes  maybe count of frame total in anim or count of frame with change...
If peoples with exp. in animation reversing can help me found more information plz
