i`ve been ripping the game viva pi√±ata for PC and viewing the files i have encountered the shader folder and data that are WAD
i`ve been trying to investigate on how to open them and decompressed them but i have only stumbled upon superficial knowledge about it

for example at the time of the making of kameo elements of power the main software appeared to be 3ds max and i imagine maya for the videos(this by the unlockable cutscenes at the replays of past levels at a certain highscore)
i imagine that is the same software at least on the making
maybe for the publishing is the xna game game studio with the visual studio of that time?
the point is that for the unique shader of the game is involved a .WAD file format

i`ve tried to use goldsource(half-life, counter strike) related modifier tools to attemp to read it but it gets me nowhere

they open on the notepad; the data.wad searches around for the shader

and when i open the shader it appear to be calling and applying the effect on the 3d model from the directx9

here the .WADS and the .TXT
