- Post Title: Localizations banned in Russia?!?

Hi guys,

It's Rado from Bulgaria here. Recently I found that lots of the russian localization websites are closed or temporary frozen during some legal issues there. From what I've read there is a new law banning all of the localizations which are made without the consent of the developer starting from 1st of August. Is that right or I missunderstood something? Can someone local share some light. I've always admired the russians and their colossal scene.

Many thanks,
Rado

o.O

Is it serious? Unofficial localizations are never meant to be infringements on copyright, but a huge help for the (mostly) non-English speaking gaming communities. Hope it's not real.

The law provides for the possibility of blocking operators of Internet-resources, which are the video or movies without the permission of the rightholder, as well as links to them.
Unofficial translations are not concern. And because of this that the websites were closed, I have not heard.
