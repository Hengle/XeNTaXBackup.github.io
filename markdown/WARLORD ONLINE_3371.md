- Post Title: WARLORD ONLINE

Just downloaded a cool game called warlord and took a quick peak at the archives. The model.pac is 808mb and here is the first part, I see a PK there in the end  And something called TFSZIP

wow, the hex dump with 64 elements per line is one of the most horrible things I have ever seen :)
anyway there are for sure zip files inside that pac archive (you can recognize them from the PK\3\4, PK\1\2 and the final PK\5\6 signatures) so you could be able to extract them with a generic ripping tool.

instead the format of the pac file is not that interesting imho, the 3 numbers at the beginning sound like the size of the data and the pac archive (808 megabytes), the informations about the files start at offset 0x214 with 264 bytes for the name of the file, 52 bytes of details about the file which don't look much interesting (probably only the "TFSZIP" at offset 40 of this block which states that the file is zipped) so you can probably skip them, a 32 bit number with the size of the file followed by 16 zeroed bytes and finally the file, so:

from offset 0x214:
- 264 bytes: name of the file
- 52 bytes: for the moment ignore them
- 4 bytes: size of the file to extract (n)
- 16 bytes: for the moment ignore them
- n bytes: the file

anyway this is what I see from a first look, maybe there are other things or interesting fields

If he posted the script from a sharing website, yes. But that seems unlikely with such a small text file.
