- Post Title: MH Ghoul Spirit .bdg file (Pipeworks bundle) Help

Hi, I was getting some models from the mh games, but for this one I got a little problem, since its use a bdg file, I think the models are problably stored in monster.bdg, tried to see something on Hex, and its a pipeworks bundle v1.30, I have tried ninja ripper since I just want the 3d mesh, not textures or even uv, but the models got posed and I really need a t pose, so I really need to get into the bdg file

I dont know how to unpack this, have used some bms script but nothing seems to work :/

the others files of the game is .pvm, .lua, .elf, .rcf, .dlf but have checked and its seems to be just the engine/texture/animation of the game, not models, if anyone known something and could help, I would really appreciate
