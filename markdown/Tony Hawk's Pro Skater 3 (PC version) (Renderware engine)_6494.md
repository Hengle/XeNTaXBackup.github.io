- Post Title: Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 (PC version) (Renderware engine)

I'm in the middle of hacking this game.

I'm gonna combine THPS1 with THPS3. It will be easy as pie, I swear.

It uses the renderware engine.

That is the same game engine as grand theft auto 3 - san andreas.

I have had a lot of success using tools designed for GTA 3.

The folder structure of this game is practically identical to that of GTA 3.

The .dff files that are found in some of the folders can already be imported into 3DS MAX using Kam's Max Scripts. [url]ttp://[www.gtaforums.com/index.php?showtopic=218318](http://www.gtaforums.com/index.php?showtopic=218318)[/url]

They could also (in theory) be opened by the freeware program zanoza modeler AKA Z-Modeler.

The .SKN files found in some of the folders are just renamed DFF's, of character models.

The .BSP files are the same as GTA .IMG files, and the .QB files found along side them are just .dir files.

I think the .QB can also be scripts, haven't tested this theory yet.

I've successfully imported 3d models into Tony Hawk's by exporting files from 3ds max using Kam's Max Script and then editing them with a hex editor.

I've already successfully replaced the bus in rio with itself.

I don't have any MEX scripts written yet because my coding is somewhat lacking (I've only ever taken 1/2 of an introduction to java course).

My dad is a professional computer programmer, so I have a codejocky at my disposal.

Any good documentation on renderware .dff files would be appreciated, but at this point I don't really need it.

Good night xentax, I have hacking to do.

This forum is great BTW, changed the way I look at computer files.

EDIT: Here's a screenshot of the reinserted rio_bus 3d model.

Soon this game will be as easily moddable as GTA 3.

I know it's common knowledge n00b!

I'm just making tools to do the job.

If you don't want my tools don't download them.

There will be full character, car, and level, and script replacements in THPS3.

But I guess it won't happen now because one guy didn't care.

That`s common sense, there even exist tool for the textures. Even the models doesn`t worth it at all (they can be imported with Zmodeler easily).

I just 'discovered' that you can put the dreamcast version of THPS1-3 into your cd rom drive, and just play the .exe files in compatibility mode for windows NT.

I should easily be able to make bootleg copies of GTA 3 for dreamcast if need be .

This is all a learning experience for me BTW.

I now have raw versions of DFF files. Nothing but direct X commands in a .inf file. All because I extracted the directx.cab file located right in the CD. Damn I feel pretty today lol.

Oh ye, any results? If it's so easy, tell me why noone before you did it? Think before promise anything.
