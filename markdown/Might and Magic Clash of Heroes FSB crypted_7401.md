Here is the audio files

I tried with latest fsbext and guessfsb 0.3 but no idea how to find the key.
Thanks

The pass is:

Here, one of the files:
[http://dl.dropbox.com/u/48495960/Battle4_loopB](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/48495960/Battle4_loopB)
FSBExt tells it's IMA ADPCM 44100 and 48000, 2 channels, 16 bit. But VLC and Winamp (with a couple of plugs) failed to play them. Anyone can help with it?

On my dropbox is one of the ripped files from the fsb file.
I have them all, if you need.

Hello again.
I know I'm kinda late, but I found an option to convert the files some time ago.
Use Luigi Auriemma's FSB extractor with the password I provided earlier on the music archive. Other archives have different passwords I never bothered to pick... anyway, the extractor has the option to decrypt the archive (or was it different extractor?). Once decrypted, you can extract and convert the files inside using MusicPlayerEx. It uses some sort of ADPCM, by the way...
I hope this helps you.
