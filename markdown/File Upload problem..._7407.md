- Post Title: File Upload problem...

I realize there are other methods to host and post files.

However, for the last few days I have been getting Internal Server Errors whenever I attempt to upload a file to Xentax.

I've tested it with RAR and ZIP files, neither of which will upload, and other (game) formats are probably not supported.

it could be that the files you wish to upload are too large. In that case, upload them to a file host.
