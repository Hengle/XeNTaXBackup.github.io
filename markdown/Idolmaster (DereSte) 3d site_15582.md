You can view the 3d object model on this site
I wonder if I can extract it.

Have a look at the page source:

```

		<style>*{margin:0;padding:0}body{overflow:hidden}</style>
	</head>
	<body>
		<div id="container"></div>
		<script>
			window.headModel = "3d_chara_head_0126_1008_M_Head";
			window.headTexture = "3d_chara_head_0126_1008_tx_chr0126_1008";
			window.headBone = "3d_chara_head_0126_1008_bone";
			window.bodyModel = "3d_md_body1008_M_Body";
			window.bodyTexture = "3d_tx_body1008_tx_body1008";
			window.bodyBone = "3d_md_body1008_bone";
			window.headHasObject = true;
			window.resourceVersion = "10021570";
		</script>
		<script src="https://files.deresute.info/model_10021570/model/3d_chara_head_0126_1008_M_Head.js"></script>
		<script src="https://files.deresute.info/model_10021570/bone/3d_chara_head_0126_1008_bone.js"></script>
		<script src="https://files.deresute.info/model_10021570/model/3d_md_body1008_M_Body.js"></script>
		<script src="https://files.deresute.info/model_10021570/bone/3d_md_body1008_bone.js"></script>
		<script src="/static/viewer/bundle.js"></script>
	</body>
</html>
```

To get the textures, insert resourceVersion and texture name into this url:

```
https://files.deresute.info/model_" + resourceVersion + "/texture/" + t + ".png
```
In this case:

```
https://files.deresute.info/model_10021570/texture/3d_tx_body1008_tx_body1008.png
```

To get the OBJ and bone data:
The files are zlib compressed and base64 encoded.
So open the 4 scripts (not /static/viewer/bundle.js).
Base64 decode the text between the quotation marks.
Extract the zlib compressed data, you can drag & drop a compressed file (extension must be ".zlib) onto this application:
[http://www.mediafire.com/file/1adckp30kk3btdb/zdrop.zip](http://www.mediafire.com/file/1adckp30kk3btdb/zdrop.zip)
I think you'll have to manually create the .mtl files.

Edit: Save this as "materials.mtl":

```
Ka 1.000 1.000 1.000
Kd 1.000 1.000 1.000
illum 0
map_Kd 3d_tx_body1008_tx_body1008.png

newmtl M_Head_0
Ka 1.000 1.000 1.000
Kd 1.000 1.000 1.000
illum 0
map_Kd 3d_chara_head_0126_1008_tx_chr0126_1008.png
```

Add this line at the top of each .obj: 
```
mtllib materials.mtl
```

Result:

How do I get the decoded text as a .zlib? And are you saying as soon as I extract the .zlib I'll be able to turn it into a .obj or...? Sorry, I'm new to this and your steps kind of confuse me. x:

It actually is kind of confusing 
Ok, for example save the file 3d_chara_head_0126_1008_M_Head.js on your computer.

1) Open the file with Notepad++ and delete this text from the beginning:
/* DON'T LOOK AT THIS */ window.data_3d_chara_head_0126_1008_M_Head="
and this from the end of the file:
";

2) Press CTRL+A to select everything, click on Plugins > MIME Tools > Base64 Decode
3) Save the file as head.obj.zlib
4) Drag and drop the zlib file onto zdrop.exe (link is in my first post)

Now you should have your head.obj

Ok, I'll give you one easy tip.
Initialize Chrome cache then go to
C:\Users\(My Account)\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\User Data\Default\Cache
and replace all files to png 
then you will be able to see the texture
With your image browser

The models are in static pose so i doubt there are any bones there, they are simple t-pose static meshes.

You can get the model files from the Bandai Namco server
You can use the Unity Studio to decrypt

The model is not in the "BNEI0242" File?
If so which files it is?

- Post Title: Re: Idolmaster (DereSte) 3d site

Getting the models from imas.gamedbs.jp/cgss/chara/index3d is a little bit harder, but here's what I did:

Open any 3d model, for example:
http://imas.gamedbs.jp/cgss/chara/viewer3d/101/1001

Change /viewer3d/ in the url to /mesh/b/ for the body (or /mesh/h/ for the head) and press enter:
http://imas.gamedbs.jp/cgss/chara/mesh/b/101/1001
http://imas.gamedbs.jp/cgss/chara/mesh/h/101/1001

Save the file and open it in a text editor (for example the body file)
Delete window.imb=" from the start and " from the end
Search for:
u-ZyJgrBw5
and delete it
Cut everything from the current cursor position to the end and paste is as a new document. Base64 decode the file and save it as mat.mtl.zlib



screenshots.png (36.97 KiB) Viewed 868 times


Also Base64 decode the other file where you cut the string and save it as body1001.obj.zlib (or whatever the id of the 3d model is)

Drag & drop the files onto zdrop.exe

Open mat.mtl with a text editor and copy all filenames after map_Kd into this url:
http://imas.gamedbs.jp/cgss/images_tx/

For example:
newmtl mt_body1308
map_Kd tx_body1308.png
becomes:
http://imas.gamedbs.jp/cgss/images_tx/tx_body1308.png

Download the files into the directory where the obj and mtl files are

Open body.obj with a text editor
Copy the name after mtllib and rename the file mat.mtl to the new filename

For example:
mtllib md_body1308_25_42_4419.mtl
-> mat.mtl becomes md_body1308_25_42_4419.mtl

I'm sure there must be an easier way but that'a all I've got for now. I also didn't have the time yet to illustrate the instructions with screenshots.

> Getting the models from imas.gamedbs.jp/cgss/chara/index3d is a little bit harder, but here's what I did...
Thx, it really helps
And I tried to find something more...

For any page of imas.gamedbs.jp/cgss/chara/viewer3d/*
model data were loaded from folder ../mesh/b/ and ../mesh/h/
as '<script>' labels tell it
(for example <script src="imas.gamedbs.jp/cgss/chara/mesh/b/xxx"></script> )
which are NOT static DOM elements

So I traced the scripts and found the global variable "a"
defined in "<script>a=blablablabla</script>",
and a decoder js file following it
"<script src="[http://imas.gamedbs.jp/cgss/js/three.bu ... "></script](http://imas.gamedbs.jp/cgss/js/three.bundle.min.js?1486798735%22%3E%3C/script)>"
(no idea what "1486798735" means)

Variable "a" is decoded at line 975:

```
var e=a.substring(a.length-7),k=a.split(e),b=JSON.parse(function(b,e){for(var f=window.atob(e).split("").map(function(b){return b.charCodeAt(0)}),k=0,r=0;f[r]^=b.charCodeAt(k),k=(k+1)%b.length,r=(r+1)%f.length,0!==k||0!==r;);return f.map(function(b){return String.fromCharCode(b)}).join("")}(e+k[1],k[0]));
```


No idea and no matter what it does,
you can get an array like:

```
 md:{
  imh:{
    u:"http:\/\/imas.gamedbs.jp\/cgss\/chara\/mesh\/h\/257\/3017",
    x:"0",
    y:"131",
    z:"-3",
    rx:"0",
    ry:"0",
    rz:"0",
    sx:"100",
    sy:"100",
    sz:"100"},
   imb:{
    u:"http:\/\/imas.gamedbs.jp\/cgss\/chara\/mesh\/b\/257\/3017",
    x:"0",
    y:"0",
    z:"0",
    rx:"0",
    ry:"0",
    rz:"0"}
  },
 p:"http:\/\/imas.gamedbs.jp\/cgss\/images_tx\/",
 sk:"u-ZyJgrBw5"}
```


Obviously it contains the url that we want,
position of model, (and some what?)
url prefix of textures,
and the split string(reversed) for the next decoding.

Follow herbert3000's step,
download this two "mesh" file,
cut their header(window.imx=") and footer("),
split them by that string(reverse(b.sk)), (you'll get two parts each file)
base64 decode this two parts,
save the first part as xxx.obj.zlib and the second part as xxx.mtl.zlib,
decode zlib files by zdrop.exe,
and you get the obj file containing model point set and the mtl file listing textures.

Obj file may look like:

```
# Wavefront OBJ file
# Created with Kaydara FBX
# 
mtllib md_chr0266_18_21_5940.mtl

g M_Head
v -0.012692 0.075740 0.102601
v -0.006363 0.068618 0.099454
```

Rename the mtl file when it defines label "mtllib".

Mtl file looks like:

```
map_Kd tx_chr0106.png
newmtl mt_chr0106_mayu
map_Kd tx_chr0106.png
```

Download all the image files in b.p(imas.gamedbs.jp/cgss/images_tx/)
For example imas.gamedbs.jp/cgss/images_tx/tx_chr0106.png

And then you get all files about the models. (I hope so...)

No any motion in the preview page, so I guess that it has no bone data.

All the steps can be done mechanically, though they are not easier.
An simple js+php script can get them automatically, if you want to own them all.

How did you extract models?
If you have extracted animation files, you can render it in 3ds max
It is useful enough because it can also make video

I extract the models from game directory: Storage Card\Android\Data\Files, then you must use this Script created by Aluigi 

 Cinderella Script.rar
(224 Bytes) Downloaded 509 times



Once unpacked the files, you can use Assets Bundle Extractor to extract the textures and then export the files as .Assets, the .assets files import them in Unity Studio and extract the models in .FBX, this includes bones and skins.

About the animations, I don't know how convert them in a useful format, the only tool capable of extract the animations is Unity Ex.

The models need a file that arranges the head and body position as well , but I don't know how make this works with the models, so I arrange manually.

When this message appears, means that file is audio or system files, just ignore it, big files are audio, small files until 2mbs are graphic files, (3d models, GUI, and texture files).

Exist a way, opening the file inside the manifest folder in SD card/android/data/starlight/files/manifest, this file contains all data information and can be opened with a SQL Editor (Firefox have one) open the file and save as .csv file, this can be opened with Excel.

But sadly the files can't be downloaded to PC, because this files need a key to download

I can confirm models can still be extracted, only issue are texture maps which have to be reconverted from PNG to PVR in order to mantain the UVW maps

Of course we can, but everything we need now is bypass "[http://storage.game.starlight-stage.jp/](http://storage.game.starlight-stage.jp/)"

Download any file you want.
tools needed 
1. telerik fiddler
2. quickbms
3. (optional) android emulator to get the latest character database.
4. sqlite browser (I used SQLiteDatabaseBrowserPortable)

grab the latest database using fiddler


```
http://storage.game.starlight-stage.jp/dl/10027505/manifests/Android_AHigh_SHigh
```

put this in the get request under composer

```
User-Agent: Dalvik/1.6.0 (Linux; U; Android 4.4.4; GT-P5210 Build/KTU84P)
Host: storage.game.starlight-stage.jp
Connection: Keep-Alive
Accept-Encoding: gzip

```

now you can right click on it and choose save response
Now run this quickbms script on it

```
get ctype long
get size long
get zsize long
get comp long
savepos offset
clog imas.sqlite offset zsize size

```

Now open imas.sqlite in the sqlite tool
and choose export table as csv
use the windows newline character
now you can open the csv in any editor you want and search for the file you want to download.
example 3d_chara_data.unity3d with hash 64ba487fcc99f86bdc38a3b029620c7e
so the url is 

```
http://storage.game.starlight-stage.jp/dl/resources/High/AssetBundles/Android/64ba487fcc99f86bdc38a3b029620c7e
```

just issue that request with fiddler and save the response as 3d_chara_data.unity3d
or if you want ios assets use
3d_chara_data.unity3d c86c359ba92e6e99f360b027204551be

```
http://storage.game.starlight-stage.jp/dl/10027505/manifests/iOS_AHigh_SHigh
```

and for the url use

```
http://storage.game.starlight-stage.jp/dl/resources/High/AssetBundles/iOS/c86c359ba92e6e99f360b027204551be
```

I was able to get the animation clips extracted, but can't provide a tool for it because I used some Unity Editor functionality. I can share the animations as fbx if anyone is interested.

Do you extracted the animations using UnityEx ? How do you process it in Unity?

No, I didn't use any third party tool, just the Unity itself. Loaded the asset bundle containing the clip using [AssetBundle](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/AssetBundle.html) class, and got the animation clip. It can be saved to disk with the [AssetDatabase](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/AssetDatabase.html) class but it doesn't help very much, so not needed.

I already had a script for exporting mesh/skeleton from Unity scene, I developed it further to include animations. Just selected a random body for mesh/skeleton from one of the body bundles.

That would be cool to have the animations too, that would leave platinum stars ps4 being the only idolm@ster game not rippable.

Did you get the animations bundle from the manifest? How is it named, also does it include head/face animations? It's a bit of a chore to redo the entire face animation in 3dmax

Bundles that contain animation clips are named like this : "3d_cutt_an_chr_son9006_01_legacy". Head animations are included but I didn't notice any face animations. I didn't check all of the files though.

Nice work. Is this a common way to output the bone animation for Unity3d games? (like MLTD)

Or maybe... can you make a small movie on youtube? I want to know how you do this.
It is OK if you don't want to make a movie, i know it is difficult and boring.
But can you post a song animation named 'æ¡ã®é ', i really like this song. Sorry i dont know the English name.

From what I understand extracting animations from Unity games isn't that common. I am planning to release a tool for it soon, it just needs a bit more work.

I don't have any info about the song names, only different ids for different animation clips. Can you send me a video showing the beginning of the song animation? I can understand which one it is that way.

A tool ? I can image how difficult it is. Good luck, no bugs  

Uh..I find this video, "sakura no koro" may be the english name.

- Post Title: Re: Idolmaster (DereSte) 3d site

I managed to make a somewhat working program for extracting the animations but can't say for sure if it will work for other Unity games. That is why I am not posting this in a new thread.

How to use

The program looks like this : 


Use  File->Open to load the assetbundles. If the program finds a gameobject with skinned mesh (character most likely) it will add it to the left list. If it finds an animation clip, it will add the clip to the right list.

Select the character and animation combination that you want. The animation will start to play if everything is fine. Select Export-> IQE to export the skeleton and animation. Meshes won't be exported. Exported file will have the name of the animation, so be careful not to overwrite when exporting multiple characters.

Here comes the pipeline. Once the export is complete you will see an iqe file in the export folder. You can view it and export it as iqm with the [IqeBrowser](http://www.moddb.com/mods/r-reinhard/addons/iqebrowser-v217). It will look like this : 


There is a dummy triangle mesh which is kind of required for some importers to load the iqe file properly. Don't worry about it, you can delete it later. 

So after exporting the model as iqm, you can load it with [Noesis](http://richwhitehouse.com/index.php?content=inc_projects.php). After that you can pretty much export it to any format you like but dae seems to work the best. When I exported it as fbx, the animation played faster than the original version but maybe it was my mistake.

Download : [https://www.mediafire.com/file/dcn16jfj ... rt_New.rar](https://www.mediafire.com/file/dcn16jfj0oq7i9u/AnimExport_New.rar)

Note : Noesis should include iqe importing

The bundle file for that animation is "3d_cutt_an_chr_son9012_01_legacy". You can extract the animation yourself with any character you want, using the method I posted above.

There is some mistake on my pc...
Here is my feedback, including CGSS, i post some games model and animation in it.
I hope it can be useful...

Ok, I was able to fix some stuff. When loading the bundles the program changes the bytes indicating the build platform, so that it will appear as a pc bundle and get loaded. Looks like the offset was wrong for some files. It is fixed now.

Cgss samples should load fine now.

Models will load fine for mltd but there seems to be a problem with the animation. Are you sure that the animation file is not corrupted? I also got an error trying to open it with the asset bundle extractor.

The alter files are a bit problematic. First of all you need to unpack them using the [Asset Bundle Extractor](https://7daystodie.com/forums/showthread.php?22675-Unity-Assets-Bundle-Extractor). After unpacking, the models load fine but animation bundles are not. I need to investigate that further to understand the problem.

Thanks for the samples.

Unlike cgss, mltd seems to use mecanim for rig/animation. That is why the animations are not being played. The program tries to load them as legacy animation but they are not. 

I am working on a way to make mecanim work but those animations that you uploaded don't seem to be character animations, or at least not body animations. Can you send me more animation files to test? You can upload them somewhere and pm me. Thanks.

I didn't notice any face animations. All those "3d_cutt_an_chr" files have clips for body animation. Did you find a bundle/file for face animation?

I try download new game data, and dont find any animation bundle, except "3d_cutt_an_chr". So I think face anim in  "3d_cutt_an_chr" too, or head bundle. And tool doesnt work with head mesh, right? Body work perfect, but head not load anim.

I try download new game data, and dont find any animation bundle, except "3d_cutt_an_chr". So I think face anim in  "3d_cutt_an_chr" too, or head bundle. And tool doesnt work with head mesh, right? Body work perfect, but head not load anim.

Face anim is very likely in the body animation. But it doesn't seem to be bone anim, maybe there is more work to do.
Ps: After i checked, the code "about" face animation is poor little, now i am not sure whether the face animation is in body animation.

Looks like face animations were in the same bundle as face meshes. The thing is that, they aren't legacy animations, so the program wasn't able to load them. 

I managed to get them to work but they are more like face poses than animations :


Anyway I will update the program tomorrow, after I make sure everything works fine. I have other stuff to do today

These information is according to c4d and mmd.

These are called facial expression(as for human). They are parts of a model. Usually the base model is take0. When you want to add facial expression, just change the model and make a new take, like take1.
Usually it will be named, like "smile". Take a bridge from base to take1, the facial expression is finished. Now you can use ExpressionController to control the facial expression, it is likely a slider. It will record the x% of the facial expression(Unlike bone animation). And it will be a frame of an animation if you register it. The player will play the animation, according to the x% changing. Usually, you can register multiple facial expression in a same frame, just like "eye_smile 70%" "mouth_smile 85%".

PS: i don't know how it works in Unity3d

I will try to implement the sliders that z22901206 mentioned. 

Also got the mltd animations working too :


Still it will take some time to add this stuff. It might be slow, because I will be busy for couple of days. I am going to finish it when I have time.

Which assets have the face expression files? 3d_chara_head or 3d_md_body files?
Edit: Nvm there, just found out, animation assets for facial expressions are located in the 3d_chara_headXXXX files



Some feedback: 
-When trying to open a any file (Example: 3d_chara_head_0250_hq.unity3d) I get the error "Array index is out of range."

Is there a way to download the Cinderella Girls Starlight Stage entire manifest? I'll be traveling for a few days and want to keep experimenting with the assets

Thanks a lot for your hard work everyone!

The current version that I posted does not handle head/face animations but it should have at least loaded the mesh correctly. Can you pm me the file that has this problem?

chrrox release a python script that downloads the manifest and the files automatically. You can find it here : [viewtopic.php?f=29&t=16055](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=29&t=16055)

I haven't seen full face animations though. There are bunch of takes with 1 keyframe each, so they are more like expressions than animations. I will add a way to blend the expressions but after blending you will end up with a still face expression.

I think they might be using scripting to blend the expressions to match the songs ingame, or maybe some other method. It looks like there are no fully animated face clips for each song.

Do you check file "3d_cutt_namesong"? I redownload some song in 3d mode, and only get some file "3d_uvm_uv_movie", "3d_stage", "3d_cyalume", "3d_cutt_an_chr_son", "3d_cutt_namesong" and 1 file sqlite music scores

Thanks a lot for the link and script akderebur , the program worked perfectly this time. Will use this time abroad to categorize some of the dance animation assets in case people are looking for some specific song (still looking for Radio Happy one).

I see face animation is still an issue, I've noticed they are attached to the 3_chara_headXXX assets but still need to be linked to each dance animation assets for the lips sync to work I supose

[https://starlight.kirara.ca/](https://starlight.kirara.ca/) -> Pick a character -> click on Raw Data Table 

It should give you all the information of that specific character starting with Chara_id

The problem in the head bundle doesnt store face animation, which is face pose. I suppose, as z22901206 said it's like morph system of MMD , CGSS use a blend of face pose in each frame to create a face animation. So now need to find a way to use this blend.

P/s: Radio Happy animation is 3d_cutt_an_chr_son3041_01_legacy.unity3d

No, I didn't use any third party tool, just the Unity itself. Loaded the asset bundle containing the clip using AssetBundle class, and got the animation clip. It can be saved to disk with the AssetDatabase class but it doesn't help very much, so not needed.

I already had a script for exporting mesh/skeleton from Unity scene, I developed it further to include animations. Just selected a random body for mesh/skeleton from one of the body bundles.
Sorry for offtopic,but will this method work with other game on Unity engine? (DC legends in my case) i can't check this by myself cuz i have no access to my laptop,so i hope you can help me

Thanka in advance! 
P.S .TEMP files should be decompressed in Unity Studio before opening

I finally had time to update the tool. It should be able to load mecanim animations now, so mltd animations should work. Sometimes animation clips are in the model bundles and they will be added to the clips list after you select the object from the left list (faces for example).

Also added the option to blend facial expressions, you need to check the "Face" box to enable blending. Still no full facial animations, I honestly think they aren't any, but I might be wrong.

New download : [https://www.mediafire.com/file/dcn16jfj ... rt_New.rar](https://www.mediafire.com/file/dcn16jfj0oq7i9u/AnimExport_New.rar)

Btw I didn't mention the controls before, here they are : 

Controls
Right-click and move mouse : Orbit around model
Ctrl + Mouse Wheel Scroll : Zoom
Mouse Wheel Click and move mouse : Pan

Make sure to select the correct root bone. It should be "Base_Reference".

I still waiting for your tool update , and I was wrong to think facial script in "3d_cutt_songname", or not? Because I see something like position and I dont think that is camera anim bundle

Amazing work! akderebur
Your tool is perfectly working about body animation,
But there seems to be data that can not be loaded for face animation.
For example, I can load 3d_chara_head_0250 and 3d_chara_head_0237 perfectly.
I tried 3d_chara_head_0267_3008 but I could not load (array index is out of range).
Would it be too much trouble for you to help?

Are you sure that the files are unpacked? That error message usually pops when trying to load packed files. Use the script that coral posted on page 2 to unpack the file first.

Hey, Akderebur, is there any chance you'll update the program to work with new Unity 2017.1 and .2.

Loading resources always throws "Array Index is out of range".

I haven't seen full face animations though. There are bunch of takes with 1 keyframe each, so they are more like expressions than animations. I will add a way to blend the expressions but after blending you will end up with a still face expression.

I think they might be using scripting to blend the expressions to match the songs ingame, or maybe some other method. It looks like there are no fully animated face clips for each song.

Looking at the file named 3d_cutt_{SONGNAME}.unity3d,
I found out what seems to be the lipsync and facials.

The lipsync and facials are in the same file (MonoBehaviour) as the camera data.
(Beware of the spelling : they do not seem to distinguish "l" and "r")

It seems that for facials, they seem to switch between facials on the frame indicated.
For "ripSyncKeys", they seem to switch between vowels in set speed on the frame.
So looking at the data may give us the key for the facial animations.

Please does anyone know how to extract or open the .unity3d files?? Everyone goes over that like nothing, a guy even asked like 10 times in this thread and no one gave him an answer. Guess my question will get the same ignoring treatment.

Use unityStudio 0.8.0 (you can export to fbx with this if your too mind closed to read the damn thread pages) and look on the thread for the link!  I did not even ask about that and i still have 10GB of models extracted from .unity3d files

I did look around and searched for answers before asking, and I already tried unity studio 0.8.0 but every .unity3d file I opened showed nothing. Am I missing something? Thank you for answering by the way.

Anybody still alive??

Since October or November 2017, I think deresute has many things changed... as the sql table was protected(?).

I posted the problem in >>[chrrox's topic - Mobile Game Asset Download](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=29&t=16055&p=135130#p135130)<< about 2 months ago.
But no one answer that question and still no response.

I decided to ask it again in this topic.
1. How to get csv file? (Maybe all tutorials before in this and that topics didn't work out....)
2. How can I view (and extract) assets? (As my Unity Studio 0.8.0 didn't show anything for all assets I transferred from my android device)
May I need some decompression?? How??
3. (After assets can be extracted) How to convert model and animations into FBX or usable unity data?

Extra Question (Unity Game Development).
How can I manage AssetBundle to download everything except card data on startup and load card data when user tapping the card (like deresute)?

Hopefully someone will answer my questions. 
Best regard, Axess.

SQL table is "protected" by LZ4. Just inflate it.

good day im@s cgss game researchers, i was kinda hoping if i could request fumika sagisawa's bright memories model? (including bones) that i can use to learn fiddling with blender/3ds? thank you

EDIT found it... now, my concern is how to import the FBX on blender then export it out for use in MMD any pro advice to a noob like me?

EDIT 2: manage to import the head and body part plus bones to blender... now how to export everything for use in MMD.

well self learning pays off (and instructions how to extract the model+bones are already posted by early deresute researchers)...  in case you missed it, its included on the file when you export the model. just use unitystudio latest, extract ALL 3d objects (to fbx). and that always includes the bones... of course the texture needs to be set manually... (this is assuming you know how to decompress the unity3d file)

my only problem is how to import those bones in MMD because re-rigging an entire model + physics is a pain. and there's the face expressions sigh.. and i hope pros will answer me if i need the "cheek" part when exporting the model to MMD... such a long way to mastery of modeling

Once you get the fbx, you can use [MMDtools_Blender](https://github.com/powroupi/blender_mmd_tools) or [Metaseq](http://www.metaseq.net/en/) to export it as pmx/pmd.

As for Metaseq:
You will get Mesh/Texture/UV/Bones/Weight.
You should do renaming/rebuilding/physics/facial expression yourself.

As for Blender, try it yourself.

thanks for the advice master... i use blender (since my newbie skills started with and has grown using blender) but i cant seem to export it correctly to PMD/PMX correctly so that i can use it to MMD or PMXe (for stuffs). so i kinda hit some "learning" wall.... anyway will try those now...

finally got PMXe and MMD to load the body + bones and they work great (can pose)... really thanks z22901206!!!

now i need to attach the head + bones to the body and that's the end of "step 1" which i understand will be the same with the body.. then apply the physics and stuffs.

now question again, 

1. how to convert the dance anims to MMD readable format

2. do i need to include the cheek part in the head model when joining to head main part via ctrl J? [https://ibb.co/gnXiDb](https://ibb.co/gnXiDb) --- boxed red (m_cheek)
because it looks ridiculous when combined with the main head part as seen here [](https://ibb.co/gtCRib)

3. finally has anyone manage to convert the expressions used in the game during the dance (eye blinks, brows etc etc) into MMD usable format since this game has been around like 3 yrs or more already?

i literally just did it 2 seconds ago and it works fine.
make sure you click
save > response > response body
it should save a file called 39_.txt
you just need to remove the lz4 compression on that file I use quickbms with no problem.

Actually you can find SQL table in Android/data/jp.co.bandainamcoent.BNEI02/file/manifest and download any assets with fiddler

kinda hit some learning wall again... i dont know why but i always either lose the head part or the body part when exporting FBX to MMD using MMD tools. LOL

i know how to extract the models (head and body) from the unity3d files and export those to 2 FBX files but i kinda hit the problem when  im combining the head and body part and the bones from both parts then exporting it for use in MMD using MMD tools. 

so i was kinda hoping if the good community of deresute researchers can teach me how to export those FBX correctly using MMD tools so i can use it to PMXe or MMD

EDIT: scratch that... managed to combine the head/body part and the bones into one and is finally usable in mmd after a bit of trial and error... wew. now i need to apply textures then fix and rebuild the bones. Then apply physics. Then play

You will have to uncompress those unity3d files first using quickbms (read back in this thread... I think it was in page 3 or 4) before you can load it in unity

Thanks for your answer. So that would be 2 times that I need to use quickbms? I used the quickbms script posted in page 3 to convert the response from fiddler into the sql table. Do I need to use it again on each .unity3d file??

well yeah... after you get your unity3d files after downloading everything, you will need to use again quickbms using the cinderella script ([download/file.php?id=12952](http://forum.xentax.com/download/file.php?id=12952)) to convert a unity3d file then load that in unity studio to export the models to FBX. there's a much faster one, by using CGSS_lz4 ([download/file.php?id=13088](http://forum.xentax.com/download/file.php?id=13088)) just drag the unity3d files to the cgss_lz4 exe and it will do the extraction itself (no need to select script and stuffs, a very friendly program) and you will end up with a filename.unity3d.unity3d (yep that is no typo) load that to unity studio and export the models.

I got my model files all loaded in unity studio just fine, and exported as .fbx, but I can't seem to import them into blender. The error says it doesn't support ASCII fbx files. Has anyone gotten around this? I tried several methods already to convert them to binary fbx files but none of them load in blender.

you will need the bos fbx importer/exporter ([http://blenderfbx.render.jp/](http://blenderfbx.render.jp/)) follow the instructions here ([http://blenderfbx.render.jp/install](http://blenderfbx.render.jp/install)) to open the ascii fbx files. i believe this doesnt work in latest blender (2.79) due to code changes (python 3.5 > 3.6) but is guaranteed to work fin in blender 2.72 (which i use)

been trying that as well because its a pain to redo every face poses and expression in MMD but seeing how earlier "researchers" didnt post about that means, the way to import the faces is yet to be discovered or maybe there's no way to import at all.

been trying that as well because its a pain to redo every face poses and expression in MMD but seeing how earlier "researchers" didnt post about that means, the way to import the faces is yet to be discovered or maybe there's no way to import at all.

Yeah, I gave up some days ago and realized it had been quicker if I just recreated the face animations myself, I am onto that now

Probably not the most efficient way, but here is how I imported facial animations into MMD: [https://imgur.com/a/XQZnV](https://imgur.com/a/XQZnV)
Note when importing into blender, the model was scaled to the original tiny size to get it to work for me.

Thanks to akderebur for the original work.

PS: I named the shape key as right eye based on my right and not the model's right.

Thank you! I've been using akderebur's tool too but was trying to apply the exported face pose as .dae to blender. Will try your method!

EDIT: Tried it but seem to have problems when importing the smd into blender, I get the pose upside down, backwards and at chest height, did you encounter this problem?

I had that problem too but it worked out fine for me when I scaled mine back to its original size then imported the pose. It might have to do with scaling or some rotation. Not exactly sure.

What would be the 'original size'? I imported both the head and body into blender directly from the .fbx exported by unity studio, didn't ever resize it.

Hello everyone, I'm having trouble with this.

I'm able to download the manifest with Fiddler, and then download a specific asset from the manifest list using a url like:
[http://storage.game.starlight-stage.jp/ ... ee562df73f](http://storage.game.starlight-stage.jp/dl/resources/High/AssetBundles/Android/d3497f01fd3539be1912d8ee562df73f) for 3d_chara_body_3010.unity3d
(I right click > Save > Response > Response body)

And then I use the bms script to decompress it, found here: [download/file.php?id=12952](http://forum.xentax.com/download/file.php?id=12952)
But then when loading it into Unity Studio, it appears empty with "Finished loading 0 files with 0 exportable assets"

Anything I'm doing wrong?

Try this:

Already tried it, it produces same decompressed file which produces same result in Unity Studio
and I've tried with many different files in the manifest, all produce empty result.

Edit:
It appears I'm using an older version of Unity Studio (v0.5.0.0) which doesn't work but the newer version apparently should.

Edit:
To those facing this issue too, the newest version of Unity Studio is from a different fork you can find here: [https://github.com/Perfare/UnityStudio/releases](https://github.com/Perfare/UnityStudio/releases)


I also made a tool in c# to automatically download and decompress manifest/asset files, though dunno if I can post here (and not too useful in its current state because it's just for this game, I was just too lazy to download individually through fiddler)

What would be the 'original size'? I imported both the head and body into blender directly from the .fbx exported by unity studio, didn't ever resize it.

I also directly exported the head and body fbx using unity studio. Then I imported to blender and then into mmd, where I rescaled it for mmd editing without face poses (this was before akderebur develop the animexport program). Some time along the way, akderebur made the program and I started experimenting it. This is when I found that when I imported my model back to blender (from pmx using mmd tools) scaled to its "original size", the imported facial poses worked. So to be honest, I'm still figuring out how to directly import face poses from the fbx exported from unity studio. I got a hunch that it has to do with the armature but I'm no expert with 3d modelling etc.

EDIT: Okay I figured it out. Just rename the Head and Neck bones to something else other than Head and Neck. Then import your pose and it should look correct.

EDIT #2: Figured out more things. Had to rename the Head, Neck AND Position bones. Here's some more pictures of how I get things to work. [https://imgur.com/a/XOxnt](https://imgur.com/a/XOxnt)

US doesn't support any animation export, neither bone-based nor Morph, till now.
The author said that he is working on it, but still in an early stage.

so uh i tried the expression importing and followed the instructions here [https://imgur.com/a/XQZnV](https://imgur.com/a/XQZnV) (like exporting the iqe using the animexporter, convert to sqm using iqebrowser, convert to smd using noesis then import to blender). followed the instruction of litecheese of renaming the head and neck bone to something else and what i get is a ridiculous "looks like mutated" long necked mess as seen here: [https://imgur.com/a/rzGUw](https://imgur.com/a/rzGUw) i know i might be doing wrong somewhere but i cant seem to find it so seeking the help of litecheese to point out where it looks like i am doing wrong.

A user contacted me saying that the animation exporter is not working for some newer files. I tested it, and it looks the clips inside the new bundles are not recognized. I don't know what the reason is atm.

Unity Studio is able to load and export the clips, but exported clips aren't really okay. There is probably a problem with keyframe interpolation, and I don't want to write a new exporter for it.

So I modified the US a bit, to dump the data of the animation clips. The dumped data can be loaded into the AnimExport afterwards. So here is how to do it.

- Download this US : [http://www.mediafire.com/file/c5e1c64v0 ... USDump.rar](http://www.mediafire.com/file/c5e1c64v0c6os9c/USDump.rar)

- Load the bundle in US, go to Assets List, select the animation clip and click Export -> Curve data in upper menu : 


- A file with the ".cdata" extension will be created.

- Download the new AnimExport : [http://www.mediafire.com/file/w8nf1q4id ... Export.rar](http://www.mediafire.com/file/w8nf1q4idzwt4vy/NewAnimExport.rar)

- Load that cdata file in AnimExport. The animation clip will be created and added to the list.

- The rest is the same. Select your character, select the clip and export.

Hope this helps some people who wants to get the newer animations.

aaaaaah i dont know anymore... followed all of the instruction litecheese posted like to the smallest details, but the expressions didnt work. all i get is that that each bones are inverted, and reversed like the back hair is on the front instead of back and the mouth-eye bones are at the back instead in front (screenshot provided). i didnt apply armature modifier anymore since i already know the mesh will become a mess in such bone positions once i add the armature modifier. it did fix the posture though...

i think its either i am doing something wrong during conversion from iqe-iqm-smd or there's a version difference with the blender plugins litecheese and i use (like mmd tools)

though i am pretty sure i use the latest though. and for details,
i use mmd tools that are from here powroupi/blender_mmd_tools, i used 2.76 blender, i also used the latest blender source tool plugin (for smd import), and noesis and iqe browser are also latest. i would really appreciate any PROFESSIONAL advice on how to fix this.

i'm having a weird issue with the new version of animation exporter
the old one without facial animation support worked fine for me, but when i export legacy starlight stage body animations instead of the base skeleton being in T-pose i get it in the first animation frame's pose, making it impossible to use anywhere at all...
do you think you could reupload the older version of the program @akderebur?

You can find the old versions in my previous posts : [viewtopic.php?p=133129#p133129](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?p=133129#p133129)

I don't think I have changed anything regarding the animation export though. I doubt you will get a different result with the old version.

The program in the post you linked me is the newer version than the one i used before. This one has the facial animations working already, and the one i was stupid enough to overwrite was made a while ago...
This one didn't work out as expected indeed though
It exports the animations just fine, but the issue is that instead of the T pose the rest pose becomes the animation's first frame, i'm not sure why

That seems to be right. The tool starts sampling the animation starting from the first frame, and exports it.

Are you having a problem after you apply the exported animation to your model? If that is the case, I think it is more related to your 3d software.

It wasn't like this before I swear
It used to be like this when you reset the animation: 
It's very important the rest pose is the T pose for me like it used to be at first

Anyone has the newest manifest of the SideM app? Thereâs been a lot of new models released since the last one posted by chrrox.

Can you public "AnimExport" source code with full Unity project,
I want to extract other game(Hatsune Miku VR) animation by this tool,
but some games not pack character model and animation together,
or not use assetbundle format.

My script depends on Unity and it basically reads the animation data that is loaded/played in the scene. If your game doesn't use assetbundles, you won't be able to import the assets into a Unity game anyway. So this method won't help you.

Your best option is to use a third-party tool like UnityStudio. It recently added support for animations. You can give it a try.

> I finally had time to update the tool. It should be able to load mecanim animations now, so mltd animations should work. Sometimes animation clips are in the model bundles and they will be added to the clips list after you select the object from the left list (faces for example).

Also added the option to blend facial expressions, you need to check the "Face" box to enable blending. Still no full facial animations, I honestly think they aren't any, but I might be wrong.

New download : https://www.mediafire.com/file/dcn16jfj ... rt_New.rar

Make sure to select the correct root bone. It should be "Base Reference".

Hello akderebur,

When I launch your tool by double clicking AnimExport.exe, the application opens the "AnimeExport Configuration" window.
There's no File menu. 
There's a tab called "Graphics" and "Input".
And buttons for "Play!" and "Quit".

Can you tell me what I'm doing wrong?
Much appreciated.

P.S. I'm tried to get the animations for one of the songs, so I can practice performing the dance : )

Click "Play"  . I made it as a Unity game, so it asks for graphics options at the start.

Hello akderebur,
Thank you for your reply!
For some reason, I had to launch it twice in a row before it worked properly.
But thanks a lot!
I will try it out.

I am currently not willing to work further on this project. Isn't Unity Studio able to load the animations from this game? I think animation support was added not long ago.

I have not tried looking at the latest IDOLMASTER game files, but when did you download the files? This week? Are you using the tool to load the unity asset bundle files directly or are you extracting the animation files from the asset bundles?

If what you say is true, then we will just have to wait and see whoâs willing to step up to the plate to come up with a new solution. In the mean time, hope you still have the old files to play around with : )

the interesting thing is that it says in description that this was created by a certain "starlight dance simulator" we all know that this is what we want why we rip the models. just hoping that someone could help me dig the internet for this.

Note when importing into blender, the model was scaled to the original tiny size to get it to work for me.

Thanks to akderebur for the original work.

PS: I named the shape key as right eye based on my right and not the model's right.

how to load fbx to blender using Bos Fbx script without error? (mine is blender v2.77)
since i can't use it, i converted it to FBX through Noesis (using the "-fbxnewexport -fbxsmoothgroups") and used the fbx script instead Bos Fbx script for model
i tried to use dae ,pmx (model was resize little big in pmx ed) & fbx (fbx make the model way to small so i don't use it because i can only see black thing ) for model and load the smd 
but nothing happened when i load the smd...only triangle mesh and more bones show instead
the face doesn't change ( i tried to load wink eye)

i hope someone can help mehh ;v;

Help..

I'm having problem importing facial animations

Is it the Blender Source  Tool the problem?

When Importing SMD, Making a new Armature shows well on the program with bones in the right place, but if I choose either two of the other options, the model just faces down with distortion.

Am I doing something wrong here?

renaming the neck and head bone to something else corrects the position as per instructions of litecheese. but i expect you will experience the same gibberish face when loading a facial animation

see that manifest folder? there's a file inside that. rename that to imas.sqlite and do the rest of the step as usual. no need for fiddler stuffs. the good thing in this is that it is a guaranteed updated database for models and stuffs

I also renamed Position too following litecheese's guide ([https://imgur.com/a/XOxnt](https://imgur.com/a/XOxnt)).  I've miss that part about renaming them, and after that It seems to work a bit not facing bottom, but the face bone still gets distorted 180 deg facing backwards.

Is there a solution to this also? Many thanks in advance

3. How to export apply bone and animation and use it in 3dmax/maya/etc...
For the bone & animation, I used akderebur's program. And successfully exported IQE.
-> Convert to IQM -> ...

4. In 1 set of character, which files are needed?
Here's my list
- 3d_chara_body_XXXX.unity3d
>> Cloth & Collision ScriptableObject
- 3d_chara_head_YYYY_XXXX.unity3d
>> Head part. Contains model data, animation controller, avatar, animation clip, head & cheek's texture, cloth & collision ScriptableObject
- 3d_md_bodyXXXX.unity3d
>> Body model data
- 3d_tx_bodyXXXX.unity3d
>> Body texture

5. For 1 song, which files are needed?
(I use [wanglata's onegai](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?p=133248#p133248) as reference)
- 3d_cutt_ac_camera_XXXX.unity3d
- 3d_cutt_an_chr_sonXXXX_YY_legacy.unity3d
- 3d_cyalume_mZZZ.unity3d
- 3d_uvm_uv_movie_AAAA_BBB_low.unity3d
- 3d_uvm_uv_movie_free_CCC_low.unity3d
- 3d_uvm_uv_movie_musicXXXX_001_low.unity3d
- 3d_uvm_uv_movie_music1XXXX_002_low.unity3d
- sqlite << Where? I can't find it!!

Thank you.

6. Joining model can be done in unity.
(Using gameObject.transform.position/rotation of Head/Neck = Body/Neck & Head/Head = Body/Head)
But how to export the different model data into one?

7. Animation can be applied in unity too.
The body was done perfectly, but I don't know how to apply head's animation.

8. Writing your own custom shader for cheek (w/ alpha texture) is not too hard, but the problem is lighting.
How to solve this?

renaming the neck and head bone to something else corrects the position as per instructions of litecheese. but i expect you will experience the same gibberish face when loading a facial animation

I also renamed Position too following litecheese's guide (https://imgur.com/a/XOxnt).  I've miss that part about renaming them, and after that It seems to work a bit not facing bottom, but the face bone still gets distorted 180 deg facing backwards.

Is there a solution to this also? Many thanks in advance

sorry mate. i cant help you there. that also is my problem ever since i started learning exporting unity models for use in MMD and the guide of litecheese?, i literally followed the step accurately A-Z without any jumps but it doesn't fix the model getting twisted once you apply the facial expression/animation other than getting correct standing pose (which i guess because you renamed the head, neck and position bones, the bone coordinates did not apply)

i theorized that during IQE>IQM>SMD export (then import), there's some jumbling of data or perhaps even bone coordinates which thus resulted to SMD import plug in of blender reading it wrong which then resulted to as we know it, distorted, twisted head model every time we apply the facial expression/anim.

need help. using the script that cornal posted on page 2 to unpack legacy files, but it's throwing me back errors... none of the legacy files in the newest deresute update work in animexporter, they just give me a bundle null or index out of range. this is the error it gives me... anyone know how to fix? or another way to unpack/decompress the files so i can use them in animexporter? P.S. cgss_lz4 doesn't seem to work for me.   

EDIT: 
there doesn't seem to be a way to rip any usable deresute animations at the moment. the new unity studio update doesn't support the deresute animations, and neither does animexporter. if anyone knows a new method of ripping legacy files, please post it here
EDIT #2: the newest version of assetstudio supports animation ripping. i also found out a method of identifying motions of the solo songs; each solo song is listed in the 3000's and the last two digits correspond to the respective MASTER album (ex. 3d_cutt_an_chr_son3038_1.unity3d = himitsu no toilette animation, master 38)

Damn I've got a long read ahead of me, hope the methods used still work, 'cause i've been looking to get a hold of these models (Especially Koume and Rina) for months and If I can get them myself that'd be the tops.

I followed chrrox step by step for maintaining what I believe was the csv or the manifest through the emulator and fiddler with no luck. For some reason I can't get fiddler to pick up whats running on the emulator so I could get the latest manifest. I'm not too sure on what I'm doing wrong, I made sure to have the certificate downloaded and placed into the emulator as well. I've tried three separate times already with no luck. If anyone would be willing to help me and get me past the first step of extracting the models I would greatly appreciate it! (also I wouldn't mind some pointers on manifests and what to look for as well as efficient ways to maintain them. I'm more use to having the data and meshes readily available to just run in asset studio and then be done with it. So, this has definitely been quite the challenge to understand since it's relatively new to me. I would like to apologize if I come of as a bit annoying due to my complete lack of knowledge! with the proper guidance I'm sure ill get the hang of it!) Anyways back to what I was saying if you can help in any way even if its just a little bit of advice I would be very thankful!

Okay so I've managed to get the manifest through the emulator instead of using fiddler to get it, although I'm not sure if I use the same url that was used as the code? I've tired exporting the response to run through asset studio and I even ran it in unity studio but it states 0 files are preset.

you can open the manifest_10045900.db with SQliteDatabaseBrowser ,and export a .csv.
maybe like live_bg2d_bg_live_03.unity3d.
I'm not sure.

i dont know if i understand you correctly but if you are trying to rip the manifest file to obtain that table to download the models, you can easily get it in your deresute folder assuming you installed the game on  your phone. rename it to imas.sqlite then load it to sqlite browser, export the manifest table to csv. and you are good to go.

that said, it seems like bamco also changed the location of the 3d models too because i cant download any models  using the automated imas model downloader phyton script that can be downloaded somewhere here in this thread.

look for the [manifest] folder. it contain a file that has a name of jumbled letters and numbers that would be the file you want.

1. ver 3.11.2 or the latest one downloaded from their official site

2. none mate but it is really easy that you dont really need a tutorial. all you need is the open_dress_id from the raw data tablefrom starlight kirara and search that number in mishiro.

Hey I'm in need of help but my knowledge is limited, I've used mishiro to download some assets, like 3d_chara_head_0243_hq.unity3d however I'm not sure what to do from there. I'm not sure if I'm missing something or misusing the tools I've tried, I've tried using quick BMS with and without the Cinderella script but I always get errors, CGSS LZ4 also gives me errors then CTD. The only tool I've been able use to extract files the .unity3d files I've got is asset studio, when finished I get alot of folders with .dat files a .file, a .ress and no .assets (is this normal) I did manage to extract a .fbx and 2 .obj One more thing UBAE doesn't crash but I'm not sure how use it, I'm assuming you need a asset bundle. Which I don't have.

Also a quick question should the head model have bones? I've imported the .fbx it contained three meshes I was able to get into blender, however it has no bones or weight. I can post screenshots of anything if needed.

after downloading the model files from mishiro, load it to asset studio(file>load folder), export all ojects (in model tab in file menu) and you will get an FBX.... import the fbx to your 3d software of your choice (in my case blender). do the same to head part (if you export the body part first and vice versa). the tedious part is recombining the head and body part by aligning the bones and joining them to one, adding the texture for the body (head file already have its texture). if you plan to use it on MMD, you will need MMD tools though.

and yep, head model do have bones the same with body. i think the weight and other stuffs needs to be "reprogrammed" back since assets studio dont export those to the FBX

anyway my knowledge is limited too and my answers are mostly based from my current level of experience.

Hey Aegis did you select the animator and an animation clip in asset studio? That appears to be the only way I extract them, which seems like it'll be fine for what I had in mind however it is time consuming, so if you find another way please let us know.

Good luck with extracting the dance animations

yes i did that. [and to extract all anim clips, it seems like you can select all of it and extract them together with the animator and you will end up with, in my case with miria akagi cinfest, 4.1-ish MB fbx file. load that in blender and do the steps in adding the morphs. <<<< scratch this... still finding how to batch add anim clips other than doing it one by one]

as to the dance anims, load the md_body model file of the SSR you want, and the an_chr_son of the dance you want then in aasset list, select the animator of the md_body and the animation clip of the an_chr_son and extract it.  and  you will get a fbx file containing the body model with the dance anim. once you got the fbx, you know what to do.

damn a brick wall... tried exporting the dance anim to MMD but when played it looks ridiculous. reloaded it back to blender, and the anim is really wrong. there must be sort of issue in mmd_tools during export but i dont know i must be doing it wrong.

FIXED --- steps how to fix the dance anim, can be found here [https://github.com/powroupi/blender_mmd ... -497182752](https://github.com/powroupi/blender_mmd_tools/issues/223#issuecomment-497182752)

Hey, i have been downloading assets with mishiro and have had success in getting models into 3dsmax. Is there a tool to download models from Idolmaster million live as i would love models from this game. i see there are ways to download the files with python if you have a manifest file but I'm not familiar with using python scripts and I'm struggling to find a step by step guide. Any help would be much appreciated,

Hello everyone, I obtained the assets following a step-by-step tutorial published in a post made by the user "chroxx" ([viewtopic.php?f=29&t=16055](https://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=29&t=16055)).

Then I used the AssetStudio application (v0.13.24) to extract the assets.

Then I exported all the assets obtaining several folders, one of them called "Animators" in which all the models were in ".fbx" format.

I have used Blender to see the models, but the morphs did not load or do not work (I use to mention that my knowledge in 3D editing programs is very basic). Does anyone have any idea why this happens or if it is an error?

I read in this post that the user "akderebur" created an application (AnimExporter) with which it is possible to create morphs with facial expressions that is basically what interests me. Unfortunately I did not understand how to make it work with the assets I obtained. Could someone do a step-by-step tutorial?

I know that a user "Lite Chesse" made a small tutorial on how to extract facials using the application AnimExporter ([https://imgur.com/a/XQZnV](https://imgur.com/a/XQZnV)), unfortunately I did not understand it since it is not specific in some matters.

How to make face expressions work on model. (Blender only.) When you finish face expressions will be writed as shape keys and you can you they in every prog.

1.Download Utiny ripper, extract all assets from model.unity3d file.
2.Open Unity load your face model with avatar, load animation clips on avatar.
3.Use Unity exporter addon to export your model with animation clips and export it.
4.Download Blender and CATS BLENDER TOOLS for blender.
5.Import model exported from Unity to Blender.
6.Transfer bone pose into shape keys with CATS BLENDER feature. Caution: Animation does not work properly, bones are just do face pose on the 1-st frame or it can be 0 frame (random for me).
So you just, transfer bone pose into the shape key or whatever you need and do rest position and rotation on 0 frame of animation.
And you you with all animation clips which you need.
Technically that is all what you need to do to make FaceExpressions to work.

How to import animations with the assetstudio to extract a useful file? in order that I can manipulate it in blender, because there is a file with the extension .dat.
I already read this post, but they have already changed the version of unity that the game uses and also the tools have changed

Use Mishiro to download models, textures, animations. 
And Unity Asset Studio can't export animations as fbx.

Pretty new to this, just throwing it out there in case anyone knows.

I have seen a few videos of a seemingly modded Deresute, like having all 5 idols being the same (might have been a clever edit) or having an entirely different body mesh (seemed legit). Is it possible to identify the DATA files, let alone repack your own in a way that is compatible? That seems like a brick wall for me.

And Unity Asset Studio can't export animations as fbx.

Asset Studio can export animations, open the FBX file in noesis and check. 

Anyone has ways to extract Msute models other than this: [https://github.com/starjet/Msute_Cst](https://github.com/starjet/Msute_Cst) or copying files from the game directly (I don't play that game)? That tool doesn't seem to be updated for over a year and all I get from it are 403 errors even though I have the right baseURL.

EDIT: NVM I found the direct URLs in Resource-urls.txt. It means I can download the models directly from the server.

For me asset studio is not exporting animations with model, do not download the newer version of utinyripper, cause it breaking models, download older builds estimated on june-august of 2019.

I donât want to explain how to import assets into Unity, I donât have to teach you how to use Unity.

So I've been spending the past few days trying to learn everything I can from this thread. I want to get the dance animations from the game into MMD as a VMD file. At this point I am able to export models into MMD as a PMX but any animation that seem to be with them in noesis never shows up once i load the FBX version of the model into Blender. So I can't export the animation as a VMD if there's no animation showing. 

I'm fairly new to a lot of this, so simple step by step instructions would be nice. Thank you ^^

I got the motion of the body, but I can't get the motion of the face.
The motion of the face when singing.
In what file is it stored?

It seems that not the "3d_an_cutt_~~~" file stores the facials but the unity3d file with the name of the song stores the  facials, cameras, and stage light informations - like the ones in scrobj file in MLTD. Yet theres a long way to parse the file so that can be translated into vmd file.

Do you know how to do that? I would appreciate it if you could share the method.

How to make face expressions work on model. (Blender only.) When you finish face expressions will be writed as shape keys and you can you they in every prog.

1.Download Utiny ripper, extract all assets from model.unity3d file.
2.Open Unity load your face model with avatar, load animation clips on avatar.
3.Use Unity exporter addon to export your model with animation clips and export it.
4.Download Blender and CATS BLENDER TOOLS for blender.
5.Import model exported from Unity to Blender.
6.Transfer bone pose into shape keys with CATS BLENDER feature. Caution: Animation does not work properly, bones are just do face pose on the 1-st frame or it can be 0 frame (random for me).
So you just, transfer bone pose into the shape key or whatever you need and do rest position and rotation on 0 frame of animation.
And you you with all animation clips which you need.
Technically that is all what you need to do to make FaceExpressions to work.

You can add me in discord if you have a question. "Cyan Blue#9804"

for those having trouble with steps 2-3:

my alternate method for steps 2-3 is very tedious but should work with CATS' shape key creator

1) open 3d_chara_head_xxxx_xxxx_hq.unity3d in AssetStudio
2) under Asset List, ctrl click the AnimationClip (shape key, face expression) you wish to export and the Animator (md_chrxxxx_xxxx_hq)
3) Export > Animator + selected AnimationClips
4) rename .fbx whatever you want (i did the clip names, so mouth_e, eyeL_close, etc)
5) delete remaining files (textures) and repeat with each AnimationClip you want exported

then you can import into blender and copy the bone pose to your main model and save as a shape key with CATS

new guy here, been browsing the forum for a while.

I found this site that sells deresute accs with a 3d model viewer, but sadly it only works for pre-2018 SSRs. 
using F12 you can see the textures and the site fetching everything from a database.

wonder if its possible to import them, though i dont think they'll serve much use since no animation data exists.

note the website is in thai
