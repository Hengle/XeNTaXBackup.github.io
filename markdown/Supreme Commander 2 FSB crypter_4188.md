- Post Title: Supreme Commander 2 FSB crypter

Hi!   
I decrypted the fsbs from the Game supreme Commander  2 using this: 

> guessfsb 0.3
>
> Trying tail padding...
>
> Possible key 1: 42 32 41 37 42 42 30 30 : "B2A7BB00"
And works fine! but the game needs the file crypted with the same key and using the latest tools from fmod..the thing it's..

Where i can found a program to crypt the Decrypted FSB -FSB4- in command line? 
I tried hacking the GH3 tool (Guitar Hero tools) replacing the key (using a hex editor) it works (well, the program dont' crashes and crypts the fsb, but looks different -i mind the ascii's and the structure-) maybe it's using a old crypter method and the game cant' recognize.

I tried the normal tools based in HCS, aluigi and the GH3 crypter (Thanks), but ...0 positive results.

I think that FSB encryption is symmetric; i.e. encryption is the same as decryption. So just run an unencrypted file through a decrypter.
