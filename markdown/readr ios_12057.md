Hi,

sorry to ask,i'm using an ios app,free and legal that allow you to download magazine,some free some to pay,after looking into my jailbreaked ipad,i've found that magz are in *.jpg,crypted with a keyfile into the dir.
the keyfile is so strange   that it show only a char,i've tried a xor with no success,well enough,i've attached a sample.

all hints welcome and sorry if a real newbie example to decode a file.

thanks.
