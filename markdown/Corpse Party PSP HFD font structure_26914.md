You don't have to edit HFD file. It is just some kind of font metadata file with "LFD" signature.
It probably contains font coordinates, but you could try to just replace characters in GIM files instead.

You can use some tools listed on the wiki [http://wiki.xentax.com/index.php/GIM_Image](http://wiki.xentax.com/index.php/GIM_Image)
