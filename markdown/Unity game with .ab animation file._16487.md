dunno what you tried exactly and don't have the time to view the video tutorial
(in fact I really hate video tutorials except 5 or 6 of them which were short   and really good)

anyways why don't you use quickbms with this script

works like a charm: paparazzi0000_126.ab -> CAB-3768e7678a1ca31315ee2abdad7c01d8
