- Post Title: TIM2 Texture Thubnail Provider for Windows Explorer

I am going ahead and releasing the thumbnail provider that will be coming with my KOC2 Tool.

Here is the Readme -

> KOC2 Tool Demo for TIM2 Texture Thumbnail support in Windows Explorer

>
> To uninstall, just click the uninstall link in the KOC2 Tool Folder in your Start Menu, use the Uninstall Program option in your Control Panel, or run the uninstaller in the folder you choose at install time.

> The old .NET 2.0 thumbnail provider was used, to provide support for 32-bit and 64-bit more easily.  It should work with every version of Windows with .NET 2.0 on it, the most probable exception being Windows 8, because Microsoft were twats when they designed it, as far as backwards compatibility is concerned.  The TIM2 files must have the extension .TM2 in order to be detected by the system.  If a TIM2 Texture file is invalid, or a TIM2 version not yet supported by the tool I am developing, you will get an error thumbnail.  If you get any error thumbnails, please submit them somewhere for me to download, so I can try and add support for them.  The only ones that shouldn't work properly, are 16bpp TIM2 textures, all other types - 4bpp, 8bpp, 24bpp, and 32bpp, should be supported, either swizzled or unswizzled, it doesn't matter.  Also, ONLY PS2 TIM2 support is going to done, so if you have any PSP textures, this isn't the thumbnail generator you are after, as it won't work correctly.  There are ZERO games on the PSP I would ever care about modding, and it's lucky that there is even one on the PS2 I am interested in doing mods for.  Only the thumbnail generator is being officially released at this time.  Once the main tool is more stable and thoroughly bug tested, I will release it.

I hate to bump my own topic, but is there ANY feedback from the people who have installed this?  Is it working, not working?  Can I get any feedback please?
