- Post Title: 2k15 dxt1 textures problem

I guess i am out of ammo 




I've tried a ton of things trying to get this texture to show properly. I am attaching the dds. The file got extracted together with its dds header and this notes that its a dxt1 512x512 texture with 11 mipmaps. There is no way to open this properly using the conventional methods, unless i am missing something.

Thanks in advance
