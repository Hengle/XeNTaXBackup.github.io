- Post Title: PSP Ben 10 Alien Force Vilgax Attacks .bin Tool

How to:-This tool will extract all the files from the .bin from " Ben 10 Alien Force Vilgax Attacks" PSP

1.Extract the ripkit folder (with winrar) & put your .bin into the same folder(extracted with UmdGen) and run the extract.bat this will extract all the files.
2.Then downsample but keep the same name,but if the files are bigger it will not be added.(to downsample read the tutorials)
3.Run the update.bat this will then inject the files back in!!(Put the new .bin back in using UmdGen or WQSG_UMD_R31)
4.When you cso your iso it will be smaller!!
5.Make a ripkit!!!!!

many thanks to Gnie and skybladecloud for the tools
