- Post Title: Spongebob SquarePants: CFTKK Audio Format Help

Hello,

I am attempting to extract audio files from the game Spongebob Squarepants: Creature From The Krusty Krab. There are two versions I am looking at, the PlayStation 2 and GameCube versions.

With the GameCube version: I am able to get the .gcp files extracted using this script: [http://aluigi.altervista.org/papers/bms/blitz_games.bms](http://aluigi.altervista.org/papers/bms/blitz_games.bms), and I end up with a list of files including .STRs. I assume these are the actual music files, however importing them into Audacity as raw data only plays garbled audio (Although I can hear the game sound a bit through it). I was wondering if anyone could make an STR to WAV converter for these types of games? (Using QuickBMS preferably.)

Here are source audio files from both the GameCube (.gcp) and PlayStation 2 (.ps2) versions: [https://mariocube.com/internal/SB-CFTKK-Audio.zip](https://mariocube.com/internal/SB-CFTKK-Audio.zip)

Here is the extracted .GCP file from the GameCube version with the .STR files: [https://mariocube.com/internal/Extracted-GCP.zip](https://mariocube.com/internal/Extracted-GCP.zip)

Thanks,

It would be good if the format could be added to vgmstream.

Solved: .WAV.STR can be played with the vgmstream plugin.
