- Post Title: F1 2021/2020 3d Models

Hello,

just a quick question because I only found one 3d Model with Textures from F1 2020.

Is there a resource where I can find already exported and mapped 3d Vehicle Models of F1 2020/2021?
Is there a tool that I can get dx11 shader into 3dsmax? Maybe a plugin? 

I found out that the decal texture is in dx11 mapped and it's hard or not possible to texture the whole car with the decal skin.
