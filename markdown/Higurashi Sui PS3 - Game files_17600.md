- Post Title: Higurashi Sui PS3 - Game files

So after a lot of looking and a lot of googling, i have come to this forum for help. I don't know if im posting this to the right place or not but the mods should help if its posted wrong!

First it was with the Data.rom but i have a quickBMS script for decoding the .rom file, but now i have all of the other files from inside of the rom file that i have no damned clue how to extract or view or anything at all. 
Many of the files that are apart of Higurashi Sui are basic files for storing images and sounds since its a visual novel. 

I have them all in the folders i think they go in and their all by their extensions. 
the extensions i need help with figuring out are as follows..
Sui_BG/CG - .pic files, i looked all over the place and couldn't find anything. Someone told me to use Corel paint and that failed. 
Sui_Mask - .msk files, Im almost positive these files are for the masks that the game uses to transition to a different BG or CG file. 
Sui_Menu - .txa files, These are all of the menus i think, because they have the names of the menu items. except for a hand full that ill list.  
Sui_Movie - .pam files, Now i know these are the movie files but i cannot find the correct way to get the movies from them because of either the sound wont be with the video or it requires a different program once i convert it to another file. 
Sui_PictureCollection - .txa files, These are those hand full of exception files i found with the same file type as the menus so i have no clue what these files are at all. 
Sui_Sounds - .at3 files, These files I know are normal PS3/PSP sound files but since their in ps3 format its much harder to find information on how to make them a format that works, since the BGM files and Voice files should apparently be put in .ogg format. 
Sui_Sprite - .bup, These are a common sprite file apparently, since the Umineko PS3 game also has their sprite files in the same format as well. But the tool for Umi doesn't work for the Higurashi Sui files for some reason. 

Im going to post the link to my Mega folder with the files in them as they get uploaded. if at all posable i would like to get a bms script for each file type.
