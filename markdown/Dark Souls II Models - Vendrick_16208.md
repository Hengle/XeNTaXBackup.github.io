- Post Title: Dark Souls II Models - Vendrick

Hi, i was unpacking all the data folder of the game but i didn't managed to find the 3d model of Human Vendrik.....i just found the texture corresponding to c6840.txtbn but the c6840.bnd file is missing. Can somebody who managed to find this file tell me how he did, please? Thank you!
