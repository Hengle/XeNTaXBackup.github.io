- Post Title: [PS2] Donald PK - *PSS File Format recreate

Hi guys, I'm trying to translate Donald PK from ps2. 
My biggest problem is the video file, it seems simple, but, it has a secret, when I use PSS DEMUX to extract the *.pss file it generates *.dat files:

and I don't know how to reconstruct this Pss, someone. Do you know how to recreate?

Maybe you could try to use PSS Plex

Check also my research on this file format [http://wiki.xentax.com/index.php/PSS_Video](http://wiki.xentax.com/index.php/PSS_Video)
There are some useful tools listed there.


Btw. M2V file is MPEG2 video stream and DAT files are data streams. It seems that your sample PSS file doesn't have any audio to demux.

PSS Plex doesn't work, the audio is extracted too, when compile, the game is mute, I tested PS2STR and causa the same issue

I have the same problem. I want to open a .PSS file but when I open it, it's mute... but in the game has sound.... has anyone solved this?
