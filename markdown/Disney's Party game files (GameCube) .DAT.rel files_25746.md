- Post Title: Disney's Party game files (GameCube) .DAT/.rel files

Hello, I'm trying to extract voices from Disney's Party, but first, I need to extract the game files to find the sound files. I tried many tools and scripts, but nothing helped in extracting the files.

There're mainly .DAT files but also some .rel and .dat, there're also alway 5 files with the same name and same size except for one letter which looks like an indicator for the language (F = French, G = German, I = Italian, S = Spanish) but it's kind of weird that ALL files of the game have a different language version.

If anyone could help me in extracting the game files to find the voice files from this game, here's a link with all the game files (simply extracted with Dolphin), thanks.
