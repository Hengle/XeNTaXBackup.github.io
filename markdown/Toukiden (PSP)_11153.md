- Post Title: Toukiden (PSP)

I'm a complete newbie to model extraction and hexediting PSP archives, so I'm not really sure about how to extract 3D models from this game.
There are two files that I suspect contain the majority of the game's assets, PSP_GAME/INSDIR/INSDATA.BIN (293,888kb) which has PGD encryption as far as I can tell and LINKDATA_A.BIN (293,748kb). 
Once I decrypted the INSDATA file, it was 293,748kb, the same size as LINKDATA_A, and they start off with the same data in the Hex editor.

Any help with extracting the models would be appreciated
