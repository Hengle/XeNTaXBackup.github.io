Has anyone been interested in [blade and soul](http://www.bladeandsoul.com/global/en)?

Lol I just randomly remembered about it after seeing some 3D models and found that it's [apparently coming to PS3 and 360 this year](http://www.technama.com/2011/blade-soul-screenshots-for-ps3/) (of course the article is 3 months old but I haven't found anything recent so it probably hasn't happened yet)

Just watching the trailer and looking at the screenshots makes me drool (look at all those weapons)   

Oh, here is their [korean page](http://bns.plaync.co.kr/)
Don't know much about it really even though it was announced awhile ago.

A lot of their models from other games are pretty nice as well.

I really interested in these models, but it' too early. They are testing the closed beta in korea so we have to wait the open beta.
If I remember well this is an Unreal Engine based game, so it should not so difficult to extract the model (maybe XD).
Anyway I have already seen some misterious extracted T-pose models from this game  on the web ....we only have to wait the company release the game.

lol it's great that people already have ideas about the game (and how to extract stuff).
Since they're already testing it'll probably be in a couple months! Hopefully
