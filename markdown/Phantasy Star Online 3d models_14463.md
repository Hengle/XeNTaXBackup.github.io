hello guys i need urgently to PSO2 models especially the boss that are very beautiful. With noesis, if they do not update the plugin, is not possible to take the models instead with hex2obj, do not know if i am me,  but the models are all except the meshes. Do you know if there are other methods?

Sorry my english.

All other methods require (to my knowledge) a more or less deeper analysis of the 3D model format in question.

Using hex2obj you'll gain results within 15 minutes for most simple models (some experience required, though).

Anyway, upload or pm a model sample, please.

start of  face indices (FIs): 0x1628D4, first submesh (1. SM)

There's 5 other starting points of FIs:  16B2E4, 16F124 etc.

1 SM, size of FI block: 0x16B2E4 - 1628D4: 0x8A10= 35344 dec. 
-18 bytes= 35326
/2 -> 17663 face indices

start of vertices: 0x294

FVFsize: 76 (offset between the 12 zero bytes sequences)

Read the tutorial again, exercise the example.
Tell, <what> you've tried and <where> you get stuck.

There is no way around to read and learn, learn and read.

There's also dozens of examples in this forum for other 3D formats where the meshes were extracted using hex2obj, by me or AceWell.

thx, here's the first submesh from the biggest aqo contained:



en_abyss_dp_dark_a_l1-aqo.jpg (122.81 KiB) Viewed 135 times


As you can see from the point clouds there's more than one submesh so the counts had to be reduced (H2O file):

0x432EB4 6011
Vb1
76 68
0x564 2707
021000
0x0 255

Should not be too hard to get the next submesh (search for 0000 0100 0200).

It will be required to calculate the start address of the next submeshes vertex block such as vaddr2= vaddr1 + 2707*76, vaddr1= 0x564
(didn't check this!)
