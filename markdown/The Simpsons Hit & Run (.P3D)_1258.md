We don't mind, but you will need to give us a bit of time to work on them 

Anyway, just letting you know that I have downloaded and analysed the archives for the 6 or so games you posted, and we should be able to write some plugins and scripts for you soon.

Oh, and the following games can already be opened using Game Extractor...
- Def Jam: Fight For NY
- Leisure Suit Larry: Manga Cum Laude
- Star Wars: Knights Of The Old Republic 2

Has anyone retrieved the models from simpsons hit and run? Any sugestions on what to do. I've tried a lot of things and have had no luck so far.
