- Post Title: Problem loading "WWE Raw" FPK

i've been using mexcom to loadup FPK archives from raw 2 for a while with no problems. but i tried to load up an FPK from the original raw game and mexcom keeps saying it can't do it?

i'm fairly new to all this, so please excuse my lack of jargon etc lol. but do i need a plugin for these FPK files that isnt in mexcom? if so, does one exist already for this?

i think this is the right thread for this, but apologies if this is in the wrong place

Well, it might be that there exist some FPK formats that are not supported, especially since the ones that were supported are from a later game. Perhaps you could upload an example.

In the orignal PC Raw game they are xpk files, and somebody made an extractor for it a LONG time ago.  You can find it [HERE](http://www.angelfire.com/electronic2/tgk/xpkgui030.htm).

I used to always do my edits with a hex editor until this had finally come out.  Even then I still would do a lot by hand, because the extractor could not handle replacing a file with a larger one at first.  If that version I linked to does not allow replacing a file with a larger one, then keep searching for the updated version that allows it.  

Hope this helps you.  This was one of the first PC games I ever hacked, and I discovered many things in the game, and eventually left the modding community for it when a certain person started stealing my stuff.  In fact today, there are a lot of newer sites that offer my stuff for download without proper credit, but I can't blame them, because they may not even know that I was the one to make the mod.  The most common item is my modified RVD moveset, which can be found at multiple sites, which includes a modified kick off the top rope move and running monkeyflip move, both of which can only be had by hacking the actual moves, something I never did fully explain to anybody how to do, as it was one of the last things I figured out before I finally left.  UTRR used to be the premiere site for getting info and mods for the game, but the site has been shut down for some time now.
