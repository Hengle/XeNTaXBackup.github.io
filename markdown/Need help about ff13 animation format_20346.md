Since you are NOT clear in your current issue, or what exactly is your trying to achieve, next time make sure include in depth info as to what your trying to achieve, maybe someone with better experience might help.
So if I to deduce based on that, once you load your desired model and it has a multi-sequence of animations, on the export window you need to add following parameter 

```
-fbxmultitake
```
 to load them individually in your desired 3d software.

Also when you click Advanced commands on the right you'll see multiple option for many more formats FBX included.

have fun
