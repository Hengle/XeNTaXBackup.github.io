Not really sure what I'm looking at.

utx is a texture file
upm is the model

The first 64 bytes look pretty nice. Don't know if it's just a single file that's encrypted/compressed or maybe an archive.

More samples can be provided if necessary.

Unreal engine format too difficult.
Guess I'll look at something else.
