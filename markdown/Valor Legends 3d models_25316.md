- Post Title: Valor Legends 3d models

Hello everyone, usually AssetStudioGUI v0.14.38 work on most unity game, even the unity mobile game, it work here too but, doesn't show any 3d model of the heroes of Valor Legends, I think they are encrypted in the obb, the apk alone is about 100mb, while the obb have a "data" (no format) file that is 813mb.
To try to make the data get decrypted with the sharedasset0.assets I tried to put that big "data" file in:

assets
--bin
----Data

but it doesn't work, I renamed it as sharedasset2.assets and using AssetBundleExtractor it extract two very small file:
CAB-1aeff5fd5ad0c85fe7b7f56185002f9a
CAB-1aeff5fd5ad0c85fe7b7f56185002f9a.resS

So if someone know a quickbms script or a hint to know where to start to understand big encrypted unity file like that, that would be great.
 With a hex editor maybe?
Thank you for reading.
