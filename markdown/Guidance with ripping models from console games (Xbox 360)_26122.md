- Post Title: Guidance with ripping models from console games (Xbox 360)

Hi

New to these forums. I signed up to ask for some advice regarding ripping console games for their 3D models and textures. Not fussed about animations. I'm a character artist, so being able to rip models from games on my own would be super useful for research purposes.  Many models/textures I've managed to find online, but I'd love to know how to do it for myself in case I can't find a specific model.

True, there are loads of guides out there, but I'm completely lost and confused. I've no idea where to start. :-\ Specifically, I'd like to know how to rip Xbox 360 games. I took a brief look at the thread here on the list of games that have been ripped, but the one I'm after didn't come up. I want to rip the models from the original The Darkness game that came out in 2007. I haven't been able to find anything anywhere online. There are a few models from the second game, just not the first.

What exactly is it I'd need to do to be able to rip 360 games? I do have Ninja Ripper, but the results were less than impressive when I tried it. But that was with a Yakuza game on PC.

Thanks
