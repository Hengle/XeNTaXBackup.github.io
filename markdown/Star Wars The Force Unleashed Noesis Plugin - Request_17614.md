- Post Title: Star Wars The Force Unleashed Noesis Plugin - Request

Morning/Afternoon/Evening all

Now that Disney is allowing assets from The Force Unleashed to be used in game mods, I've got my hands on copies of Noesis and The Force Unleashed in the hopes of using some of the assets in a Battlefront 2 mod. As well as directly porting assets like Stormtroopers, I feel like some of the game's assets would give me a real leg up in creating new models, like using Shaak Ti as the basis for a Rebels-era Ahsoka Tano, or mixing elements of Yoda and Kazdan Paratus to build a Tsui Choi model.

The problem I'm facing is that, having spent some time poking around the forums and some other websites, I can't find a Noesis plugin or other tool that will enable me to extract the assets. I've followed a few links but they mostly lead to dead pages, as the plugins and tools go back as far as 2009. Fortunately, I did manage to find a plugin to import TFU models into Blender, which will be a big plus for me so huge thanks to whoever made it. So I was wondering if anyone could send me a working link, or recommend an alternative tool? If this counts as asking for warez, or necroing dead content, I apologise.
