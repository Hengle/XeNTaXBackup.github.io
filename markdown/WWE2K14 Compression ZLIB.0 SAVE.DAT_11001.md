Hi guys , i have problem with the savegame this year for WWE2K14  and his ZLIB.0 format, currently I can only uncompress but not re-compression 

investigating the file "SAVE.DAT" with surprise i see that there are 3 files zlib inside ZLIB.0  .....,so my idea is decrypt full  the save with quickbms   and look  the offsets   and make the break up  of the three files separately  and resign this  with tool zlib.
After this procedure .... add the header ZLIB.0
maybe something can be done ........... i hope the developers view this topic  for solve this issue

look this pictures .i  (78 01 in hex editor) is a normal compress zlib







here my original  personal savegame ZLIB for your testing :
