- Post Title: Vindictus KR server has new hfs format

In the latest update, Vindictus KR version has changed the hfs format.

Neither "VZipFlip" nor "HFS Extract" can extract the hfs files.

And the old wiki about Vinidctus hfs structure is no longer the same I think.
([http://wiki.xentax.com/index.php/Vindictus](http://wiki.xentax.com/index.php/Vindictus))

I have uploaded a file as an example, hope someone can help and figure how to extract the new hfs file.

Great thanks!

I found a quickbms script on aluigi's site that actually works with the new hfs format - it's this one: [bms script](https://aluigi.altervista.org/bms/mabinogi_heros_hfs.bms)

Unpacking the files now...

Steam version and Nexon NA/EU has updated to the AES encrypted version (same as KR.) Old script won't work.

Is there an ETA on when this encryption can be cracked?

Someone interested in work in this extract?

I have a possible key to decrypt AES: ASCII "65925AD99D428123739DA1CD058FF9C03DE74F09C9EA81E9418332178E1F8426"

Okay... Now for someone to make a working script with that. Thanks anyway 

I'm interested in making this extract work since I need a couple of models from this game.

Hm, decryption with AES-256 seems to fail. I'll need to look into this more.

Could also be that the key is specific to each file.

That could be another problem: I'm on Steam with that game... Could it be that hey KEY strings are different between the platforms, but the encryption is the same?

I doubt NA Steam and NA Regular has different files/encryptions. I'm downloading the KR client to check if any of the files match.

You have that same doubt for NA Regular and EU Steam? Forgot to mention that I'm in EU here...

Anyhow: IF that works, that would be great!

NA and KR use the same encryption. 000C2BCC80488BECD685D0DF8A0AFC176F427C4C_00000.hfs are identical.

Now for EU... Or does EU use a different client?

If the new script's ready right before I'm going into paid holidays for a week, that would be something to get a basis to work on.

Doubt EU will have different keys.
Script probably won't be ready soon, still trying to get encryption keys. The one Zenzor provided doesn't work with AES-256-CBC for any file NA or KR.

It's highly unlikely that "keys" differ between clients. At most, there will be change in data, due to patches.

This is indeed the case. I haven't had any luck trying to find the decryption proc yet though

While it probably won't help, I've managed to establish the corelation between HFS and some files.
C59FDBADFBB93D8024D3F2CB516F696D6D8A9B78_00000 is the database file.
then there's the localization file, but its HFS is dependant on the region, so each region's client possesses an HFS that is exceptionally made for that region and won't be present elsewhere.

Same applied to the old HFS files.

If anyone is well versed in reversing encryption schemes, help would be much appreciated.

If anyone is well versed in reversing encryption schemes, help would be much appreciated.

After about 5 months of thinking, it could be that I've found a different method:

I went on a quick google trip today in the morning and found out that the AES encrpytion (which Vindictus uses) can also be reversed with a small program which is called [AES Crypt](https://www.aescrypt.com/). This program does not only encrypt files with the AES encryption, but is also capable of decrypting them.

Now the question is: What kind of AES encryption is used (as the .aes file extension is missing)? And can the linked program crack it?

By the way: I found out somewhere else that this game runs on a modified version of Valve's Source Engine. Can this be another possible starting point?

Maybe - it looks like AES's only parameter is the key (which I guess is somewhere in the Vindictus code) but I'm not sure if the files are AES encrypted or the files are container formats with AES encrypted data.

The Source engine doesn't have any built-in encryption for archive files by default - some script files can be encrypted but that is it.

Vindictus heavily modified the source engine. It had encryption before, but they just doubled down on it. The IV on AES can change as well, but I don't think they did in this case.

If I remember correctly, the hfs file format is some kind of an archive format, much like rar or 7z. Unfortunately, 7Zip can't open the files with the message that they can't be opened as an archive. So, we've got a kind of archive a normal unzipper can't open.

I went down the road and explored the game files a bit more. There, a folder named "BlackCipher" crossed my view - and some of those files have some kind of AES encryption. Maybe we'll find the solution in this folder? If there's need, I can pack all the AES iles in a 7z archive and place it somewhere. It also looks like this BlackCipher is some kind of anti-cheat tool which MAY be blocking our path to unpack the hfs files as well. There are two more files right in the main folder (where the Vindictus.exe lies) of the game, which also seem to have something to do with the Nexon Launcher that comes with the game - and those are AES ecrypted as well.

If I remember correctly, the hfs file format is some kind of an archive format, much like rar or 7z. Unfortunately, 7Zip can't open the files with the message that they can't be opened as an archive. So, we've got a kind of archive a normal unzipper can't open.

Closest thing I can describe HFS as is an encrypted, modified ZIP format. Required special tooling for this reason. The "Old" one worked like that, the "new" one I have very little idea about it. It's encrypted from start to finish.

I went down the road and explored the game files a bit more. There, a folder named "BlackCipher" crossed my view - and some of those files have some kind of AES encryption. Maybe we'll find the solution in this folder? If there's need, I can pack all the AES iles in a 7z archive and place it somewhere. It also looks like this BlackCipher is some kind of anti-cheat tool which MAY be blocking our path to unpack the hfs files as well. There are two more files right in the main folder (where the Vindictus.exe lies) of the game, which also seem to have something to do with the Nexon Launcher that comes with the game - and those are AES ecrypted as well.

BlackCipher is one of the three anti-cheats that NEXON uses, not related to the game archives. All of their games have it.

In this case, I'll have to leave the field to the coding experts - absolutely clueless here.

I also thought of getting an old version of the game to get the stuff I need, but I don't know if the stuff's in there... Would it be helpful if I link an older version with the "old" hfs files, to get a clue on what of the encryption changed?

Maybe. My extraction program for the old HFS formats is [open source,](https://github.com/yretenai/HFSExtract/tree/master/HFSExtract) I can't say if the format changed much since it's encrypted.

Then, here's what I found: [Vindictus v1.69 from the Windictus private server](https://windictus.net/downloads)

Also, there seems to be a new wiki from XenTax where a new article about this format was written. Interestingly, the last edit on that article was made on April 4, 2021 so someone might have to check if the article reflects the current state of the hfs file format. If it does, does it help with busting the encryption? Here's the link: [Vindictus HFS article](http://wiki.xentax.com/index.php/Vindictus_HFS)

Format on the wiki is still the old format, someone just added it to the XOR Encryption category and renamed the article.

As Yretenai said in newest version HFS files is encrypted by AES (probably modified) cuz for setup encryption keys it uses SOSEMANUK multiplication tables (I have never seen such thing  ). There are no static encryption keys, they are dynamic and are generated from the file name

Soseman is a cipher based off AES Serpent, which is why it looks similar. Likely are just using the normal Soseman chiper as-is in a common block mode like CBC or ECB

So, encryption algorithm is not AES or Sosemanuk. I just restored code of functions for keygen, updating and setup keys, function for decrypting data is next !



No one will help me?

Encryption like this is a bit over my head, or I would help  

Good luck though, it's going to be fun to see full paths without having to unobfuscate them.

There is a small problem, IDA and Ghidra give incorrect arguments for functions in pseudo-code. For example, Ghidra think that the decryption function has no arguments and decompiles it like void blablabla();, IDA decompiles function with one argument int blablabla(int hehe), but actually function takes 4 arguments 

Edited: nvm, it's done

It's nice to see the progress is somewhat moving from dead point.

Meanwhile, I've managed to pin-point at least 4 HFS, whose content can be obtained without decoding.

Hm, can you provide names of these files? We will need this in order to understand where we need to decrypt data, and where not.
At the moment my code looks like a complete mess, i need more time for code cleanup

point is, the data in those particular hfs can be acquired in another way, since they're loaded in the client and stay there.

Database of what?  

Continuing to reversing hfs format, I found out that offsets for header and entry table are generated from file name

like this

That's the sql database of the client, containing information on items and stuff.
its header always starts with "SQLite format 3"

I may be a beginner when it comes down to programming (and reverse engineering of files), but we can use this sql database to find out where the files for models and stuff are located, right? If yes, I need to give it a look  

Anyway, it's great to see this coming back from the dead, as I need a total of 8 models (basically 1 model, but 8 different clothing variants) of Sylas from this game

It's not used for that. The database has stuff like xp curves, drop tables, item stats. The actual models are referenced elsewhere.

The only people that really care about that file are private servers, which is likely why the encryption got changed.

You're right. Although that last part about only private servers caring about this file is a bit far-fetched. Telling this as the person that does care about that database and doesn't care about private servers.

Now that's quite a step forward!
Do multiple-part archives behave the same way? Though my personal guess is that it should display the path, then actual data in that path (in comp format)?

From what I've seen, the client reads the file, then perfoms the query for the second part (even if it doesn't exist). And if it doesn't exist, the client will move on to the next file.

So, here decrypted entry table for reversing structure from 77EEDAF6871DCC7B83BE580E005294A26F71CDCF_00000.hfs archive.

list of files

```
wchar_t filename[filename_size]; // WPATH
int32 size;
int32 unk0; // always 7, probably flags.
int32 offset; // multiplied with a constant
int32 unk1; // always < size, probably encrypted buffer size.
int32 unk2// always < size and < unk1, probably compressed size.
uint8 hash[16]; // md5? encryption key?

```


personally a big fan the directories are no longer [the sha1 hash of "MaTeRiAlS@vGuI.0"](https://github.com/yretenai/HFSExtract/blob/cd7af012083adb6bf77635c346679bd858dbbdee/HFSExtract/HFSDirectoryMangler.cs#L19)

You're right. Although that last part about only private servers caring about this file is a bit far-fetched. Telling this as the person that does care about that database and doesn't care about private servers.

You're right, I glossed over fan sites and data users-- my apologies.

yeah unk1 seems to be compressed size, no idea what unk2 is, seems to grow with both sizes (in most cases)

double compression?  

As for header, I'm guessing the first int is used to calculate the offset of the entry table, and the second int is used to calculate the offset to the data?

I'm confused by this, no ideas whats in SomeIntArray... Maybe offsets?

I'm confused by this cycle, no ideas what in SomeIntArray

45 is a size or offset.

5121 (0b1010000000001) -> 6144 (0b1100000000000)
6143 (0b1011111111111) -> 6144 (0b1100000000000)
6145 (0b1100000000001) -> 7168 (0b1110000000000)

which means you need to multiply offset by 1024 to get the actual offset from data start.

it's fast alignment math, it aligns SomeIntArray[45] to 1024. assembly doesn't have modulo so this is what compilers tend to do. Actual code is probably

```
	result += 1024 - (result % 1024)
}

```


Index 46 and 47 point to the same thing just at the start and end.

Okay in [45] table end offset or size   (77EEDAF6871DCC7B83BE580E005294A26F71CDCF_00000)

```
0x3CF8 - 0xF8 = 0x3C00
0x3C00 + 0x400 = 0x4000
```

Updated my reply, I was overcomplicating things.

```
Entry Table Offset = 456 (0x1C8)

15152 + 456 = 15608 (0x3CF8)
0x3CF8 & 0x3FF = 0xF8
0x3CF8 - 0xF8 = 0x3C00
0x3C00 + 0x400 = 0x4000

```


I guess result here it's a begin offset for files data.

```
int32 unk1; -> Data Size
int32 unk2; -> Encrypted size
```


Example

```
[HFS ENTRY]: materials/post_process/bandi_video.vmt, 2075, 6, 0, 53, 56, C9F4C367C751564E87F8605F0929771E
```


```
Offset > 0x800
Encrypted Size > 56
Real Size > 53
```


I noticed the file datas must  be decrypted 2 times 

```
Decrypt #1 - 13 D4 48 1D A1 96 58 4C AF 5C E1 0D 35 58 35 3B D1 95 98 69 A5 48 A0 CC 62 C0 44 F8 50 33 15 E2 E3 9D D9 47 B6 13 C0 E9 34 CB 4D 50 71 1C 13 0F F0 CA 50 75 19 AE 14 7A
```


```
Decrypt #2 - 22 55 6E 6C 69 74 47 65 6E 65 72 69 63 22 0D 0A 7B 0D 0A 09 22 24 62 61 73 65 74 65 78 74 75 72 65 22 20 22 5F 62 61 6E 64 69 56 69 64 65 6F 22 0D 0A 7D 0D 0A 00 00 00
```


Result   

```
{
	"$basetexture" "_bandiVideo"
}
```

Code: Select allint32 unk0; -> Compression flags > 6 not compressed, 7 compressed by zlib

Looks like flags are

```
0x2 0b10  EncryptedRound1
0x4 0b100 EncryptedRound2

```


Round 1 and 2 are guesses, but it would explain why it's encrypted twice.

Info content about all HFS's (headers, entries and log)  Mirror #1 or Mirror #2

Man, that is REALLY nice!   This helps me finding the files I need to get the models I want. But it seems my OpenOffice can't handle close to 5k pages of text when searching for all entries with a certain wording xD

Now for the script to arrive (if there's one in the making)... In the meantime, I'm searching for the files I need  

Edit:
I just can't seem to find the location of the texture files for the inner armors (e. g. for Hagie) - found the models so far...

The texture files for inner armors should be located in the characters' texture files. You need to search for the character that first features the character's body archetype (normal, giant or tall). Reason is because each inner armor is treated as a separate body and for other characters it's reused.

In case of characters like Hagie/Sylas, you must seek most of them in Lethita's inner armors textures (aka Lann)
Female characters use either Fiona's body or Evie's (except for certain inner armors that are either changed depending on character or are exclusive to said character)
Giant = Karok
Tall = Hurk

Modified version of AES Serpent using some constants from SNOW and some from Soseman, with multiple rounds of encryption.

Read a bit about Serpent and Sosemanuk and it definitely seems out of my capabilities. I suppose I'll join others in waiting for someone to top the great achievement and release the means of extraction that commoners like me may use.

Hope my previous posts contributed to the discussion to some degree.

Try "HFSExtract-v2-StandaloneFull.zip", I just added it. It's a larger download but contains all of .NET 6.

Hard to tell, the naming pattern changed with the format change, but all files do extract now (with folders!)

Sorry, I want to know what went wrong，I brought a screenshot


Try "HFSExtract-v2-StandaloneFull.zip", I just added it. It's a larger download but contains all of .NET 6.

You're great. I love you

I successfully extract .mdl files but some of them can't be readed by decompiler like Crowbar or other tools.
Extract model and animation files from lastest KR client.

This is because the newer mdl's are a different model version. right click the mdls that wont decompile, open them with notepad. at the very start should be "IDST-" change the - to a , that should fix it. it worked for me when i ported tessa to gmod.

Someone else actually messaged me about this. they fixed it by using notepad++, as when they used regular notepad it corrupted it somehow. make sure not to remove anything, not even a space. just replace - with ,

haha, all good. i should've put quotes there. atleast you fixed it.

in regards to noesis, i have no idea how to use that as i import them into blender then export them for use in garrys mod. you might need to find someone else who knows about noesis.

or hopefully someone else here knows noesis

Vindictus renders textures a different way compared to other source engine games. you have to manually desaturate them and colour them yourself.

Interestingly enough, as of recent, I find several HFS files not unpacking, due to the argument being out of bounds. Could it be that some files have different system in place? This is an example file:

Trying to extract it returns the unhandled exception:

I'll just add that I tried the same recently with the kr test client and while all the old files can still be extracted without any issue, 
Only the new ones which contain latest stuff and last character seems to be different and spit out the same error on each file .

Tried the same with the kr live client today after the update but nothing changed.
Looks like they changed something inside the latest files (from Letty release on test server 24/11 till today).

If other files still extract, I'd first assume something is wrong with the decryption implementation I have.
The header decrypts fine, the file table does not.

They're just going to change the encryption if me or EKey update again. I don't have the time to chase after a game that I don't even play anymore.

You'd have to talk to EKey, he did most of the reverse engineering work for the new HFS files.

i totally agree with you, it makes no sense to update what will be changed in a couple of patches.

They changed passwords for newest archives. Anyway there content list of these hfs's> [https://pastebin.com/fPp650xj](https://pastebin.com/fPp650xj)

Extracted content (Letty): [Mirror #1 (Available for 7 days)](https://dropmefiles.com/1RMWb) or [Mirror #2](https://www2.zippyshare.com/v/06tQcR1Q/file.html)

Don't waiting for tool updates (no make sense), i guess this will affect for all hfs in the future.

You are THE god amongs gods! Thank you a lot!!!

If I can add some details, specifically letty character was released in kr around 6 months ago.

Back then only her files had the password changed. Nowaday, still, only her files have the password changed.
Despite, in the meanwhile, the new content doesn't really involve only chars but also new raids maps, outfits, and other stuff,
only her files seems to be different from the others. 

All the other new content like maps, outfits etc works fine with your extractor.
That make me at least doubt about the fact the new password wasn't meant to be applied to all the new content, but only her (and my guess is any future char). All the rest, even if new, can be extracted normally even today after 6 months.


Last thing. Since as i read there won't be any updates on the extractor, would be possible to add a small feature to the current one?

With these new, present and future,files that cannot be extracted the current program just stop and close everytime it find a file that cannot be worked out. This mean we have to manually isolate those few files that cannot be extracted manually and through lot of trials, separate them in a different folder each darn time, which take a long time...

Would be nice if the current extractor could just 'skip' the files that cannot be extracted and/or make a text log where are specified the files name(hfs) and keep going on instead of closing, so at least we would have a bit of an easier life in splitting the not working files from the working files.

Again thanks a lot!

Passwords has changed for every new archives, I think they will continue to use this method.

That's awesome, Thank you both. It will help for sure.

If no future updates we might come here, from time to time, sacrificing a lamb and praying the gods for the new files to be extracted. (jk)

Thank you guys for your hard work and courage to share your findings and works with the people, Yretenai and E-key! 

I notice that the devs already placed a separate additional layer of protection in addition to the ones on Letty (and onwards) files. However, this protection touches solely on 3 folders worth of text files. However, this change isn't something as significant in comparison to the bigger picture.

Probably this is a preliminary preparation for changing the protection for all HFS files, just my opinion.

Maybe so. This protection does seem to touch files directly. So when you extract the HFS file containing localization (e.g.), the output txt files are shown to be encrypted.

Thank you guys, Yretenai and E-key!  You guys are really amazing!

Btw I have a question, I used hotfix version of HFS extractor, and extract the KR client hfs files which contain Letty's related files.

But I got these messages "Error occurred during a cryptographic operation.", I already have .NET 6 installed. Did I do something wrong?

Hello.

This means that the files in question cannot be unpacked, as the encryption changed. Breaking this new encryption is no longer planned.
Previously, attempting to extract such files would lead to halting the unpacking process altogether. The hotfix is made so that the extraction process would continue, skipping the files it couldn't unpack.

the models dont have facial bones because they dont use face bones for expressions, they use vertex animation. they use a set number of expressions that are made for the models. the facial flexes are coded on the models themselves. it is possible to rip the facial flexes but its very time consuming.

i personally dont add or extract the facial flexes(so i have no idea about tools), ive only ever fixed them if theyre broken when the characters are decompiled.

as for the animation path. im surprised you havent seen it, its in "models/player/_anim/"

Before anything, I want to express my gratitude and admiration for the amount of skill and work some people here have put into decrypting and handling these files over such a long time. It truly is insane.

My question however is, where did the animations go? I can't find _anim folder anymore...
And also no Miri character models.

If they changed something (yet again), would there be any older game version available somwhere, maybe on one of these asian sites I'll never find? 
I only really care to export Miri and her animations...

Honestly, if someone still has an older version and could zip and upload the animations folder and miri model that have gone missing, I'd even pay for it.

Not sure - is it possible to use a Steam depot downloader to get previous versions of a game? I thought with Steam API v2 you could and probably not with Steam API v3 but I'm not sure.

is there any other new way to unpack now?
there's so many models I can't get yet...

and all the files I got are broken

thanks

You're right, it does work,  [Guide How to Download Older Versions](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=889624474)
