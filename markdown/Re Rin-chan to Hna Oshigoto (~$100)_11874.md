I'm not asking for a full source code with nice documentations, 
I believe that someone experienced with .NET reflector and 3d modelling
can get the materials and shaders in the right place quite easily,
since the files from this Unity game can be extracted with so many tools.

Or if you think your effort is worth more than $100 you can always feel free to PM me,
I would love to consider your offers.

No bad feelings intended

mmm... Chipicao is working on a fbx eporter for unity. It's curious, I also want the model from that game and from hamedoll for MMD, If you want, you can ask him what's the advance of his tool.

Here's the link:

The fbx can already be extracted using the third link from mu previous reply, it's just that you have to put the textures and shaders to the material by yourself, which is cumbersome to produce the same results.

Just a note that the only .NET code are the user-developed ones. All of the actual Unity engine code is native.

Do you want shaders applied?? The shaders outside Unity are useless. The importer autoapplies textures, but there's no bones nor skin modifier.

I don't really need the codes though, just need the models, shaders, and camera in the right place in Unity.

Do need the bones and other stuffs to get the exact visual results.



This is what I have currently, but I need the bones, animations, and the correct shaders in place to achieve the exact results. Also some simple scripts to make the eyes follow the camera.

Unsure why this program [viewtopic.php?f=10&t=10085](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=10085) gives .ani files for animations, instead of .anim or something else.
