- Post Title: Need help with a file

I want to extract a the mesh from these files
MDB, XS and LOG

I think the XS file is a script, and the LOG file can be read with notepad, it contains a lot of information, but I can't put it to good use.
In the log file you can read that MDB stands for Motion DataBase.

The game is Bolt, by Disney (yeah, I know, but I need bolt's model :p)

I tried 3DRipperDX but it doesn't work whe nrunning the game. There seems to be a mesh in front of everything making it unable to extract the data.

Any help is greatly appreciated
