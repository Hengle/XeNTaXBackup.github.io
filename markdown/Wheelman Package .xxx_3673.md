- Post Title: Wheelman Package .xxx

Hello guys i was wondering if one of you experienced coders can identify this file format here. xxx are mainly Zlib or some variant, its from the pc version and this looks compressed in the file, i can identify some headers like fsb4 and fev1 which are the audio headers, but other than that it looks really compressed.

You can use my FSB4 scanner to extract the *.fsb files. Should be all you need...  Other than that, it's a new UT3 engine variant and it's been worked on.
