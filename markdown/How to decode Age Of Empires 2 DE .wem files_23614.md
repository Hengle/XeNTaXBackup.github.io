- Post Title: How to decode Age Of Empires 2: DE .wem files?

Hi Guys,

Having trouble with .wem files from AOE2:DE - I'm basically just looking to play the .wem files to see what they are, really struggling! I've tried a few tools, but it seems like these ".wem"s are not encoded in VORBIS, so i'm getting errors!

I've attached a sample file, if anyone can give me an idiots-guide as to how to use a tool to decode these, it would be much appreciated!

Just install Foobar and the vgmstream plugin and they'll play.  That file says it's Custom Vorbis format.
