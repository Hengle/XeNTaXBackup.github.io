is there a good way to get models, textures and animations off these 2 games (in the case of VS, an evil game)?

Um...load Noesis, browse to the FF8 img or fs (depending on PSX or PC) file, double-click the file, click "yes", click "ok", then go find the models it spit out, and double-click on them in Noesis. Would you like someone to do the double-clicking for you as well? I know it can be awfully tasking on the index finger.

Maybe you were. And maybe I was completely serious, and have genuine concern for the longevity of your index finger. Just maybe.

I don't know of any VS viewers/importers, though I do know at least one other person who's shown interest in it, and I have a mild to moderate interest in it myself, so there's hope for a brighter future. Otherwise, maybe people are fully aware of VS importers and plugins of all manner, and they are hiding them intentionally from both you and I. They may realize the error of their ways and share their plentiful resources and knowledge with us, if we bump the thread to say "argh, no one can help?" another few times. Or maybe someone is already working on a solution, and there's no way they will share their work with the world unless this thread maintains visibility. Or maybe the one man who holds the infinite and powerful knowledge of all Vagrant Story related things has missed this thread. One thing is for sure, you can't let this thread fall again, or it's all over. It's on your shoulders. I'm counting on you. We have to keep this thing alive. For the sake of all humanity, damn you, don't let go. Don't you ever let go, Devilot.

while I do salute you for your technical knowledge, this unnecessary sarcasm is an insult to your own skills (and genius, to a certain extent). ever since is wrong to ask for a clarification?

Finally, I am understood.

It's not even sarcasm, really. It's my jovial, careless, and uninhibited reaction to a rather pointless post. As your post wasn't along the lines of "Does anyone want to help me look into Vagrant Story?" or "Well, I have FF8 taken care of now, can anyone help with Vagrant Story?", but rather a completely half-assed, vaguely directed comment along the lines of "I am ignoring the previous two people who tried to help me for at least one of the games I mentioned, without so much as a passing mention of the word 'thanks', and asking for a tutorial (on what? reversing the format? using non-existent software to parse the format?) or plugin without even specifying that I am now only interested in one of those games."

Also, who said I was a genius? I'm just some fucking guy with a hex editor and a weird sense of humor. Come off it already.

It is not I who will denigrate a work (yours) that deserves merit and credit, even if from your POW it might look like a little thing.

It is not my fault if the propositive style of a question at the beginning of the topic was ignored. Lack of interest can drown even the best interest to start a discussion, let alone with a total beginner in the technical field.

My produced work has nothing to do with my personality or "genius", though. Very different things. Something deserves merit on its own if it's somehow useful or provides something to someone. If you can't draw the separation between the creator and the creation, it's your viewpoint that is flawed on the matter.

Based on that second paragraph, let's just chalk it up to my grumpiness/sickness/freezingness/being sick of people constantly asking without giving, and your language skills, and leave it with an I fart in your general direction.

To get the thread back on track and further re-iterate, no, I don't think there are any existing tools for Vagrant Story, and yes, I'm sure I or whoever else will post here if we end up doing anything with VS.

-my language skills are nothing short of exceptional. It is not my concern if your mood is powerful enough to affect your capacity to understand what I want to express. 
> I fart in your general directionalas, how sad that someone so capable has forgotten what it means to start from the beginning. Such unpleasantness makes you a great disservice.-

I asked because someone was able to at least rip the textures  and I thought that together with said texture the model would be extractable. And considering I cannot contact the original author, I came to the place that I deemed the one with the most knowledge available.

Well, the textures are sort of the easiest trick in the book, as the vast majority of PS1 games store them in the same format (TIM) which has a relatively easily spottable header, so there's readily available programs that'll get all the textures out without needing any knowledge of the game's other internal structures. Models, on the other hand, can and will differ wildly from game to game even in the same company (can't think of two Squaresoft PS1 games that use the same model format among the ones that are known), which is why programs like Noesis have to be expanded on a per-game basis.

So I'm afraid all that texture indicates is someone ran timviewer or something on Vagrant Story, not that work may even have begun on models.

ah, that's the problem. I knew about propietary formats but guessed most of the models were the same for all games.

And no need to be so haughty. None of this would be happening if you had at least acknowledged the FF8 half of your question had been answered.

For that matter if you could provide some sample files (SEQ, SHP, WEP) like the [rules](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=28&t=1270) advise you to it'd probably go a long way towards interesting readers. It's disappointing you had to be incensed before you even posted that texture.

at least I did not resort to offensive behaviour. this reprobation of yours I'll considered and think upon, even if it is totally unappropriate, being so one-sided. and my problem was not solved, since Noesis cannot open my .img file (I'm on a PAL version of FF8). but who can feel motivated to post if this is the reaction that the learner has to expect?

> incensed... now that's rich. I'm the one offended and it's my fault. if you want to call something disappointing, point your finger at the lack of interest, discussion and support. that alone can demotivate even someone as propositive as I am.

I would blame lack of resources from the requester.
If I were writing scripts to hack games I'm not going to DL 10 gigs of data I don't need.

If you're looking for FF8 tools try qhimm.

qhimm is a bit unhelpful regarding ffviii AND extremely unfriendly to beginners.
10Gigs? Vagrant Story is, at worst, less than 1gb. and I certainly did not ask anyone to download the game (illegally as you suggest) or to burn one's own copy to an iso. and I did not request a script to hack games. my idea was based on a wrong assumption, I'll take the blame for that. I'll check my own copy of VS and post what I find.

browsing a bit with Noesis... mm, is it normal that when you export as .obj the actual model is blank? even if you ask to export the textures?

also, when I import in 3ds max 2009, it says that "matlib" is not found. the material library. how could I fix that?

I had to manually re-texture it.
Then again I don't use any cool 3D software and just use metasequoia.
