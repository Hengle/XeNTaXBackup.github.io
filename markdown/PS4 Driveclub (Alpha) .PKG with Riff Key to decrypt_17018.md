- Post Title: PS4 Driveclub (Alpha) .PKG with Riff Key to decrypt

Hello !

I wanted to know if it was possible to unpack the app.pkg of the game Driveclub (alpha version) .iso ?

I heard we need to have the riff key for this, and yes, it seems we have a "working" riff key :

decrypted rifkey =  97 85 7A 12 3E 1D 01 FB F1 81 C5 F0 AE 5D 49 03

It would be interesting to start extracting contents and export those great cars models ;D
