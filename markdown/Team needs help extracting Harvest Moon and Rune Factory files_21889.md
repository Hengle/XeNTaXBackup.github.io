- Post Title: Team needs help extracting Harvest Moon and Rune Factory files

Hey guys,

I work with a team that extracts game data from Harvest Moon and Rune Factory games in order to pull sprites, models, dialogue, etc. to use on our wiki. We do this in order to create an encyclopedia of accurate game information for these series. Currently, we are getting extremely stumped with .bin files, especially for it's PSP games like Hero of Leaf Valley, and unpacking .xbb files. 

The .bin files are our biggest hurdle, as they contain almost all of the game's data, and we would really appreciate help from anyone who is willing to assist us in extracting the content of these files. 

I've gone through XeNTaX and most of the links to extractors no longer work, so if you have any of these files as well, I would appreciate it.

Thanks for all of your help.
