- Post Title: Divinity 2 Ego Draconis - how to edit ingame texts?

I have an idea to try to translate Divinity 2 Ego Draconis to my native language. The game was released in english in my country and I know that there are many players who would benefit from translation. When I tried to unpack and edit game files I experienced two problems:

- Ingame texts (dialogs) are storred in strange *.xml files. You can see and edit all texts, but there are not xml tags, its some different format. Do you have some idea what it is? And if it can be "unpacked" to some real txt/ascii format?

- More important problem - when I try to pack all dialog xml files with dv2pack utility it doesnt work correctly for english version of the game. It creates 25 MB dv2 file, but original english "DialogData.dv2" has only 1.7 MB. The game refuses to open it. If author of dv2pack utility comes to this forum - please, could you fix this problem? I assume that it wont take much time, there will be only slight change in file format.

Original english "DialogData.dv2" file and XML dialog file (two files as an example) can be downloaded here:
"[www.volny.cz/farflame/d2data.rar](http://www.volny.cz/farflame/d2data.rar)"

Link to dv2pack utility should be somewhere on this board.


I would be very grateful if you could help me. I will try to solve it myself, but I assume that there are much more experienced modders on this board than me. And there were long discussion about edition of Divinity2 DV2 files on this board some time ago.
