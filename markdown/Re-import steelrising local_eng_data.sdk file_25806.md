Hello, I want to translate the game into my language. I found the text files in local_eng_data.sdk. I unzip and extract the file using 7-zip. But when I convert the file from 7z to .sdk and enter the game, it gives an error.

local_eng_data.sdk: [https://www105.zippyshare.com/v/FsVkFYyK/file.html](https://www105.zippyshare.com/v/FsVkFYyK/file.html)

It is a ZIP archive [http://wiki.xentax.com/index.php/GRAF:ZIP_Archive](http://wiki.xentax.com/index.php/GRAF:ZIP_Archive)

You can change extension from SDK to ZIP and then edit archive in Winrar.
You don't need to convert anything.

Hi, I open it with Winrar and take the text files inside and edit them, and when I put them back into the archive, the game gives an error.

So the game does a checksum validation. You need to debug game's code to find out what algorithm is used and how to bypass it.
