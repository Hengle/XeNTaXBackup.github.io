- Post Title: Compressed .json file (.z extension)

Hi Guys! Before the game update, it used .json files, but after update, it's using compressed .json files with  .z extension. Tried to decompress with gzip and stuff, but they showed errors. Also when I compressed .json (from older version) with gzip and the filesize was almost the same as compressed file i can't open. When I looked into HEX, i noticed that all compressed files (from game) are starting from 2 and then some 4 random characters (they are different for each file), either letters or numbers (like 2JE1Q). In HEX those are 32 4a 45 31 51. I've attached examples (before-update .json file and after-update compressed file). Please take a look and leave a reply, I really need help on this!
