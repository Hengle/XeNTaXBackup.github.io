You'll have to use a program called Ravoli Scanner [http://www.scampers.org/steve/sms/other.htm](http://www.scampers.org/steve/sms/other.htm). Here's how people add music files into gams like wwe 2k series: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPidktEUzrI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPidktEUzrI)You can also try a file called PCK Editor. I don't have the link of where I got it but I'll be more than happy to send you a Mediafire link. I hope you're successful as I'm trying to mod those same type files into Wildlands. Good luck and please contact me, if I can be of further assistance.
