Okay, this is very little info you gave me.   

1. You downloaded the programs? Which? MultiEx Commander AND TRE-Archiver?  
2. And which of these gave the error?
3. When did this program give the error?
4. Silent Hill 2 is not in the supported games list, right? Do you have a reason to assume that the .TRE files are the same format as those .TRE files for SWG?
