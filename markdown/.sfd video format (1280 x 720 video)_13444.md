- Post Title: .sfd video format (1280 x 720 video)

Hi! These types of .sfd files used in Sonic Unleashed don't seem to work with regular SFD converters, causing artifacts all over the place.

Could it be because of the higher resolution?

Here's an example file: [http://www.mediafire.com/download/jxelw ... s2e_00.sfd](http://www.mediafire.com/download/jxelwsgqwer1wab/evmo_transform0_s2e_00.sfd)

Mediafire plays it just fine!

I'm sorry, but is this some kind of joke?

I'm sorry, but have you ever tried vgmtoolbox for that?
