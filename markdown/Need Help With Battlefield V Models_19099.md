- Post Title: Need Help With Battlefield V Models

Hello , i tried to extract a character from the new game Battlefield V using the Ninjaripper. I manage to extract the character. But i have these problem. I don’t know why but it looks like these when unwrapped, it looks very different than my others characters, and that’s really a problem because the applied textures don’t apply in the correct spot, I have the same problem in 3DSMax and Blender. Someone know how to fix this?. Thanks. 

Heres a picture with the problem i have with the Battlefield V character, it also contains a picture with a character from Hell´s Highway with correct unwrapping and textures.
