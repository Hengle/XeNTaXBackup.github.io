- Post Title: Finding out where Arc the Lad R (mobile) stores its models

Salutations,

I've been trying to extract what I can from the JP version of the mobile game "Arc the Lad R", which I believe is running in Unity, but I'm not sure where to locate the files containing models. I had been playing on a non-rooted device (each emulator I've tried gets as far as the initial load screen, and then sits on black), and looking at my storage, there's at least some data within the "data" and "obb" folders. "Obb" has just one file, "main.159.com.arctheladr.forwardworks.obb", while "data" has a lot more that look to be textures/pictures and some obvious AWB/ACB music that I have been able to successfully extract using quickbms and HCADecode. Anybody happen to be familiar with this game and its structure, and whether all of the necessary files happen to be downloaded locally?

I'm sorry if this isn't much to go off of right now. I've been trying my darnest to figure this all out, and the pressure is really on since it shuts down for good tomorrow. 

Thank you so much for any help!

(I acknowledge that there is currently a global version available, however it's super new and doesn't have all of the characters, and honestly I'm not expecting that it will last long enough to get them all... plus, they had Wild ARMs collaboration characters as a mobile game tie-in that are probably likely to never show up in global, and they're on my top-most priority list of extracting)

Taking another look just now, I noticed that there's a "downloaded_asset_manifest.json" wedged in amongst a bunch of long alphabet and numerical string files. Would this indicate what I'm looking for? I can try to upload it if that would help.

Also, it occured that it might help to provide a link to the game in question:

Many thanks. )
