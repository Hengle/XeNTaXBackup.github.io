- Post Title: Playboy format pages on the WIKI

I've been tracking anonymous changes to one of the Playboy format descriptions on the WIKI for awile now, but I haven't intervened at any point because I don't know if the anonymous user is actually contributing useful information or utter garbage. In any case, the following pages are directly involved:
Playboy CAM 2 (main page edited)
Playboy PICT 1
Playboy PICT 2
Playboy PICT 8 (new page created by anonymous user)
These are the other Playboy format pages:
Playboy CAM 1 (untouched by anonymous user)
GRF Playboy The Mansion (also untouched)
These edits are the only ones performed by this particular IP. Could someone who originally worked to uncover these formats have a look and render judgement?

It does look like graphics info, doesn't it?

Yeah, that's what it looks like, but I'm not sure if any of it's actually correct.

Maybe you should set a way to make a  log of what user edits what page.
as tbh i have been tihnking this for a while but the WIKI is the most obvious place for a BOT to post in dont you think.

If there was a LOG of some sort you would be able to PM and ask the person and set ti so that they couldnt post without a propper username ect.

I tihnk my idea makes sense btu im not sure how hard itd be to impliment as i dont know much about webpage design so i cant even venture a propper guess lol

Well, anyone can edit. We are powered by the Mediawiki system. 
As sysops (Me, Dinoguy, Captain, Watto, Elbereth) we can easily roll back any edit from a bot/spambitch at any time. And block them or their IPs too. Trouble is to identify spam, I guess, in the post from Dinoguy. I'd say in this case, the stuff looks real enough, and I didn't notice any hidden messages.

Exactly. As for the log, every page on the WIKI has its own 'history' record, viewable to one and all, and there's always [Special:Recentchanges](http://wiki.xentax.com/index.php?title=Special:Recentchanges).
