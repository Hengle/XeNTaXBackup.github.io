- Post Title: Shantae and the Pirate's Curse .vol (PS4)

The title pretty much says it all. I'm trying to rip this game (mainly for the music), but I've been unsuccessful thus far. I've even tried aluigi's [BMS script,](http://aluigi.altervista.org/bms/scooby_looney.bms) but it's not working for me. Can an alternate solution be found? I've included a few sample files to check out, of course:
