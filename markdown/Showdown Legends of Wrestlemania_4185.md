I know this is kind of an old game, but does anyone know how to extract textures from this game?  It looks like it is a .dr format.  If at all possible, could someone provide a way of extraction or possibly a bms script if it is with quickbms.

Thanks

Wow, that is an old game, but almost every wrestling game on the original Xbox used Zlib compression on the files, from what I remember.  I'd try that first.  

It would also help if you posted a sample file, I no longer have that game.

Here is a little sample from the main file.  The main file is 242 Mb.  This also is from the PS2 version, but I can probably get my hands on the Xbox version if that would be easier.

Post an Xbox file, I don't deal with PS2 or any other Sony formats.

It will take a few days before I can get my hands on it, but I will post an Xbox file as soon as I get it.  

Thanks in advance for the help.

It's no problem, it's just the waiting part that sucks.  It seems that everyone (Gamestop, video stores, etc...) has pretty much dumped their original Xbox games and no one carries them anymore.  I figured easier off e bay than scouring the local flea markets.

lol I just bought it too. Did look for it in other ways.. it's a little old though for that.

Anyway we'll need it eventually hopefully. 

I have to say, I am a complete beginner here and I can't offer any help other than sharing the files. I would love to learn, I'm not sure if I'll ever get an understanding of this though.

If any of you guys on here can help with this, being able to extract the wrestler textures eventually mainly in my focus,

I am willing to make a reasonable donation for your time and effort.

I know some of the basics, but am pretty new to this myself.  I've been able to extract textures from all of the SVR games, Here Comes the Pain and Shut Your Mouth (all PS2 versions), but have really run into a roadblock with this game.  But I'd be glad to help in any way with the previously mentioned games.

There hasn't been any Xbox game that I haven't been able to get the textures when I've tried, all Xbox games use pretty much the same compression schemes.

Well, that is great news.  The only problem for me is that I never had an Xbox, I've always been a PS/PS2 guy, so all of my games are of that format.  But I am definitely willing to learn and/or make investments in those old Xbox games.

Ok, I got the disc in the mail today.  I've never extracted from an Xbox game though.  I have a folder called VIDEO_TS, and then inside that folder i have VIDEO_TS.BUP  .IFO  .VOB and VTS_01_0.BUP  .IFO  .VOB.  Not sure which of those files you'd need or if I need to open them a different way.  Can you tell me what I need to do next?

Hey Bunky.

Those are just a few short videos for the game startup. Everything else is hidden

I forgot that it isn't possible to read xbox dvds in a pc. Different format. As far as I know we either need to make an iso out of it, or ftp the contents over to pc from xbox to be able to look into the contents. You need a nice 'enhanced' xbox for both of that unless I'm mistaken-

And I don't have a working one any more! (I think I threw the lot out)  

I searched around a while, and I can't see any update on the ftp situation.

So nothing you'd call good news there so far.. I take it you don't have a uh, enhanced original xbox either, bunk

Maybe Mr.Mouse or brienj knows something we don't and can suggest..

I know, I know. They know a lot that I don't

Well, I guess I have some good news and bad news.  Good new is I found the ISO online.  It is a huge file, so I am not sure what piece of it brienj will need.  Bad news is, it looks like I really didn't need to buy the game.  I opened the ISO file with hex editor, and trying to make some sense of where those textures might be located.  Anyways, I can chop up some of the file and post it, I'm just not sure how big of and which section to post, and if it will be any help.  I will keep looking until I hear back from brienj on the situation.

Looks like Zlib compression in there.  I need to finish getting all my old programs on my new computer to check it out for you.  Maybe someone else that knows Zlib can help before I can.

I think there might be an app which can extract the textures but I cant tell from the chunk you posted. Can you post a link to the full costumes file and I'll check it out.

Just wanted to say that and, get well soon B. Glad you made it and that has nothing to do with the hacks I assure you, lol

I know how it feels to get 'slow', it's pretty frustrating and low. But hopefully, in time mate.  You'll speed up again

Well I've been messing around with the file using Jaeder Naub, and when I run it with Zlib compression, it breaks the file down into about a million smaller files, half of them ending in a .xlib extension, and the other half ending in a .dat extension.  Now the .xlib ones just look to simply be the main file divided into smaller parts, but the dat files look like they may be of some use.  The first one I looked at said something like elbow pad.map and another one showed bandage.map, but I haven't really got any further than that to this point.  Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

I told you it looked like zlib compression was used.  Xbox formats are usually pretty simple.

Well, it looks like it might be a DDS file, but I am not good with the headers for those, I was hoping somebody else might be able to step in and help.

its a model file with several small embedded dds textures.

use offzip to extract the files without names.
offzip.exe -a c:\file.dat c:\extracted 0x0
if you post the exe i may be able to find the file names in the executable file.
this could be a xex file or elf file.

OK, first off, let me say thanks for jumping in on this.  Is this a picture from the file I posted earlier? 

"if you post the exe i may be able to find the file names in the executable file."

 I am a little confused on what you are asking here.  I am not sure which exe file you are referring to.

Also I have the offzip program, but am not too sure on how to use it.

I ran offzip on the entire WRESTLER.DR file and it broke that file down into a bunch of smaller individual files.  Here is an example of one, can you please look at this one for me?

He means the default.xbe file for the game.  That would be the executable file for the game.  

I gotta ask, since it appears you don't know much about Xbox stuff in general, what in the world do you plan on using these textures for?  Textures are usually only good for using on models, so WHY do you want these textures so bad?  I just have a feeling that your next step will be creating a thread to ask how to use these textures on something else.

There's a lot of interesting old school wrestlers in there with multiple attires, so if it can be cracked it'd be a great resource and I'd be trying quite a few of them out on caws myself- I'm happy to help where I can but, pretty useless to the cause. I could manage repeating extraction steps.. finding them is something else

We could use the face/attire textures in paint tool hacks for sdvr2010 - yeah I know it's been said already, but Bunky isn't the only one interested in doing it, that's all. 



Nice to see something come out of this though, (animal) thanks everybody for the help and interest so far

Well it's good that so many people have gotten use out of that PTExplorer that Mr. Mouse made.  

I have become a CAW sycophant and made a stat hack, which I am tweaking and improving, and other hacks that will help people that use the CAW mode.  Just keep checking my Youtube account and my website for more updates to the roster hack.

I wish I had the money to grab a J-tagged Xbox, I don't think I would ever need to buy another wrestling game ever.  But for now I am stuck with CAW mode, and this is where my interest for cracking this project comes in.  Although you saying that you are working on stat hacks it news to me.  I would be very interested in exploring that.

Looks like with the CAW stat hack you also need a J-tagged Xbox, so looks like I will be missing out on that as well.  But still pretty cool to follow.

use offzip to extract the files without names.
offzip.exe -a c:\file.dat c:\extracted 0x0
if you post the exe i may be able to find the file names in the executable file.
this could be a xex file or elf file.

How are you extracting the dds files. When I open up the dat files offzip extracts from the main archive, I cant seem to find any dds files. Did you add a custom header?

Sorry to bump an old topic. I've been trying to extract the textures from the game. I've used offzip on the DR file and have managed to get a lot of .dat files. The question I have is, is there a bms script that will extract the individual "PAD" files within the .dat files, as those are the individual textures? The dr.bms script which was posted in the other topic seems to have no effect at all.



The bit highlighted below is what the dds header needs to replace in order to view the texture correctly.



Thanks in advance
