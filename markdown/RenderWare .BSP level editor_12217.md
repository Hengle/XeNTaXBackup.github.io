- Post Title: RenderWare .BSP level editor?

Sorry if this is the wrong place to post, but is there any RenderWare .BSP level editors? I am looking for one that will work with Monsters, Inc. for the PS2. Thanks!

no chance. unfortunately renderware was too flexible hence every developer added anything they wanted to. there is original bsp exporter for pc games, but it most probably won't work as it doesn't even work for average pc rw game without major tweaking. it only contains mesh and game files might contain additional game data, custom effects, etc. most probably you'll have to investigate the differences and write your own editor or patch the exported bsp file, but i guess you don't want to bother that much.
