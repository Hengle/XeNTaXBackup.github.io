- Post Title: Silent Hill Origins - files .TXD / .CMI

Hi there!
I need help with open and edit files - .TXD and .CMI 
Both are from Silent Hill Origins game on PSP. I've extract them from big file called "SH.ARC"
The file types are:
.TXD - texture file
.CMI - "map" file

[http://www.sendspace.com/file/wtn7tl](http://www.sendspace.com/file/wtn7tl)

Also if someone had information where I find the game font, please tell me!

Thanks a lot!

TXD = texture dictionary
This file come from RenderWare SDK. RWSDK3.7 can be found from internat, but the TXD in SillentHill is newer than RWSDK3.7

How about .CMI - it's a map graphics.
And also I need to know how to edit main menu: New Game, Load Game, Options

And without open that files we can't make sure about that. So... In the end I (and you caws) must wait until someone check that files and find a way to edit them.

Older than GTA IV uses .txd files.
You could try the TXD Editor.

Yes and No.

First YES - I found package of tools for Silent Hill Origins. 
Package have a .ARC extractor, TEXTconverter, CMIViewer and TXDeditor.
I want last two tools (other I wrote myself with friend's help)

Now NO - people which created that tools want 50$ for hack programs.

Found out that the creator of these has a github account.
And a repository, as it turns out, filled with various old tools (including their source code): [https://github.com/mbystryantsev/consolgames-tools](https://github.com/mbystryantsev/consolgames-tools)
Indeed, there are files named "CMIViewer", "TDXViewer" right here: [https://github.com/mbystryantsev/consol ... %20Origins](https://github.com/mbystryantsev/consolgames-tools/tree/master/legacy/sources/Silent%20Hill%20Origins)
I haven't tested them out personally, but I hope someone (if anyone is still interested after all these years) finds them useful.

I edited the texture of "Welcome to Silent hill" sign. 
Here is:



I used the quickbms script of Aluigi to extract and repack the .ARC file: [http://aluigi.org/bms/silent_hill_origins.bms](http://aluigi.org/bms/silent_hill_origins.bms) and
some TXD tools for GTA to edit the texture, as you can see it is possible. This is the PS2 version I don't know about the PSP version.
