you can get 3d models off of the dolphin emu. basically run 3dripperDX or 3dvia on the emu ad play a game. you can capture the models this way.

The only problem its you cant capture the ¨T¨ pose and need take lots of time to edit the captures in something 3D program, this with dolphing or any screen catpure system.

I should note though that you will have to rebuild the rigging and animations from scratch, it only rips the geography, not the models themselves. It is what I had to do with Super Mario 64 but what I was ripping didn't have any animations so it was fine.

Naruto: Clash of Ninja Revolution, 1 and 2 use MDL0, as does Naruto Shippuden: Gekitou Ninja Taisen! EX 3. These are supported by BRRES Viewer and Brawlbox, though if can get to work I would suggest BRRES Viewer as it exports to MD5 and PSK/PSA which are easy to convert to other formats.

The only ways I see that as possible is:

A) To extract models in memory in their primary frame (most often T-pose), though this option is not available to Dolphin atm.

B) Hacking animation by means of Action Replay/address tampering, this I know can work.

C) Some games having a model viewer.

Edit: Clash of Ninja Revolution 3 uses MDL0, have fun! You can find another post here about reading/converting these.
