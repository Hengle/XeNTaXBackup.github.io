- Post Title: Space Channel 5 (PS2) SQ File

Recently I have found that Space Channel 5 (for the Playstation 2) uses the PS2s native SQ format for its music,
But when making a PSF2 from the relevant data it only reads the first bar of the music,
This is because the SQ contains multiple tracks a la MIDI type 0,
The tracks each contain a one bar snippet of the music which the game then dynamically strings together depending on how good you are doing.

I would like to request a converter that can either separate the tracks into individual SQ files or one that can convert the SQ into a MIDI type 0 with multiple tracks.
