You can Extract Sounds in two steps:

Step One
Use [this tool](http://www.box.net/shared/0f0hfp8mz2) and extract sounds from "sounds_sfx.pck".

Step two
Use [ww2ogg](http://db.tt/QgxWMWr) and convert extracted sounds into ogg.

Thanks a lot to Red dead redemption for that awesome utility.Thanks a million again.But i have run into a problem.The ww2ogg Keeps posting errors and stops working after 4 or 5 files,No luck there i suppose.I am trying to open and edit every file in sound forge,but that would take forever .Any help from your end would be great

If you could post the particular errors you are seeing, and possibly the particular files, we could be of more help.

Trying to use that extractor tool - the progress bar advances, and then it says 'done', but there are never any files. At first I extracted to a directory that didn't exist (default 'users/ali') by accident, but then I tried to a real directory and the extracted files are never there but it still says 'done' every time. Where is it putting the files?

I don't know about that first tool, but the second one can be found here: [https://github.com/hcs64/ww2ogg](https://github.com/hcs64/ww2ogg)
