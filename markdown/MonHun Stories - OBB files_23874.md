- Post Title: MonHun Stories - OBB files

Hey there! 
I have some .obb files i managed to get from MonsterHunter Stories, I've tried quickbms, however this isn't working out,
I tried the renaming obb to zip however this, naturally, didn't work either.

I'm looking at the file within a Hex Editor but I'm not really sure what I'm looking at,
additionally both files I have (pretty much the entire game) are too big to upload,

I know I'm not giving much to go off of, I hope this image atleast helps!
