- Post Title: Help with Epic Mickey 1 and 2 (WII)

Hello, I've joined this forum because I really really need some help. I'm trying to rip the music of these games at the request of a friend. I don't know much, I did a quick Google Search. With the first game, I managed to use WiiScrubber to play the ISO. Problem is.. there's like 1200 wav tracks I gotta extract manually one by one and then pass to VMGStreamer to dump it to actually play a song.. Could you guys help me out, do you know any better faster method? Also, Epic Mickey 2, can't know where the music is, as it's filed under audio in a weird format with names that don't look like music names.. Any help, please?
