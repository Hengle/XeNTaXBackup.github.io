- Post Title: EDF 4.1 The Shadow of New Despair

The game recently came out for PC, but unfortunately I haven't got it yet. While the quality of the insects isn't superb, some vehicles are pretty cool. I know it's pretty early to ask, but has anyone ever extracted the models from an EDF game? If anyone has the game, can you upload a sample file? Thanks.

I managed to extract the .cpk with an unpacker, and I've uploaded what appears to to be the character models from the main menu.

Dunno if this will help anyone with model data but here you go.
