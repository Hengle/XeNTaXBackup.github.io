I quickly made out a Blender add-on to import the binary *.rip files from NinjaRipper. This is a nearly 1:1 clone of the 3dsmax script. Enjoy

It supports most of the things that the 3dsmax importer supports

Use Ninja Ripper to import them to 3DS Max, then export them to a format usable by Blender.

But why use 2 pieces of software if you can use just 1?
Plus many people don't have 3DS Max, myself for example, I don't use, or like the software, I use Maya instead, but others use Blender instead.

Exactly. I don't know what kind of point they are trying to make. Many thanks to the maker of this useful addon.

Hello, I've been using this NinjaRipper addon for Blender:
[https://github.com/angavrilov/blender-i ... injaripper](https://github.com/angavrilov/blender-import-ninjaripper)

Are there any note worthy improvements in Dummiesman's addon compared to angavrilov's addon?

I haven't had any major issues with angavrilov's addon yet.

Which version of Blender are you using for this angavrilov's addon, please ?

Don't know what you're on about, 3DS Max is very good, and I use it both with Blender, so sucks for you.

Probably not smart to Necro a 2 year old thread especially when you don't seem to have any idea what was being discussed at the time.

ninjaRipper is one piece of software, 3DS max is another, Blender is another.
Importing into Max, then into Blender is a 2 step process, importing into max and then blender is a 3 step process.

You're defending a piece of software without reading the context it was in, or reading that it wasn't attacked at any point.

If you're a Blender user, what possible reason would you have to go and use 3DS max as an import/export software if you can just import straight into Blender.

It works in Blender 2.79b.

Open Blender 2.79b, go to User Preferences, Add-ons, and type 'rip' into the search box.
Once you located the installed NinjaRipper add-on, you should see the following descriptions:
- Description: Import RIP files
- Location: File > Import
- Author: Dummiesman
- Version: 0.0.1

If you have different Ninja Ripper add-ons installed, enable one and disable the others.

Thank you!

This step did succeed.

Do you have tools to import DAT and dfont files into blender?

Sorry, I don't know anything about dfont or dat files.
I did a quick google search for, "Blender import dat files", and there were a few results related to something called LDraw.
Not sure if that is what you are looking for.
