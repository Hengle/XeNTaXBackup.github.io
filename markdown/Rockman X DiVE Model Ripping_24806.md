- Post Title: Rockman X DiVE Model Ripping

Hello! I have successfully obtained the Steam version of Rockman X DiVE, and I'm wanting to rip the models from the game with their bones and armatures intact, so that I can freely pose them.

Unfortunately outside of X, Zero and Axl, all of the files are encrypted. There are around 6000, each ranging in size from a few kilobytes, to a few megabytes, and are apparently encrypted using XOR.

I would like to know how to decrypt them, and how to export them to something like Blender for easy posing.

I have attached a few of the files in question to hopefully help better understand how they work.

When you download new content, the assets will be at 

```
C:\Users\[YOUR-USERNAME]\AppData\LocalLow\CAPCOM\ROCKMAN X DiVE
```


But as you said, the assets are encrypted and cannot be opened using [AssetStudio](https://github.com/Perfare/AssetStudio). Anyone knows how to decrypt it?
