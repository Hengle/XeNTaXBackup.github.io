I have all needed programs to work with this tool, but, unfortunately, it doesn't work. I'll post some samples tomorrow.

Yes, good advice above rubies... But i can unpack any PSSG file too, not only this font file and not only graphics content, but parameters and other content in editable form (maybe these is as XML source). Then i ask, if anyone have an PSSG tool to it (self, from Sony or directly from Codemasters, sure).

File, about i discuss, is one from Codemasters F1 2010 game and one from "frontend" folder (there exist one file for one language game support).

Edit: Sorry, but attach file here fail for me.
