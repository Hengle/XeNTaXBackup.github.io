- Post Title: Anarchy Reigns Instrumental Audio Location

Not entirely sure where this would fit in the rest of the forum, so I decided to drop this here.

Anyway, I've got the .cpk files unpacked from the 360 version, and while I was able to find all the regular BGM stuff, the instrumental tracks seem to be missing entirely (with the exception of the orchestral and campaign stage tunes). Unless, that is, there's some kind of layering function that .aax files have, in which case they could contain both instrumental and vocal parts.

For anyone who's ripped stuff from Anarchy Reigns/Max Anarchy in the past, would you be able to point me in the right direction?
