I won't download samples from hosters (here: 4 shared) who want to leech/invade my social networks, sry.

Also: what did you try so far?
(You won't expect others to download the whole game, do you?)

unpack the game apk with 7zip
unpack the package.apk in assets\applications with 7zip
the unity files with models are in the assets\applications\package\assets\bin\Data folder
get Quickbms (link in my sig) and AlphaTwentyThree's Unity3D Engine *.assets extractor script 
[viewtopic.php?p=77959#p77959](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?p=77959#p77959)
and run it on files that look like this to extract a bunch files with number extensions
0a6b3783f74945d4ca933c2969434c5c
the .43 files are the models
get Noesis (link in my sig) and finale00's Unity3d .43 plugin here to open the models

the textures are .tex (type 34)but i don't know what format they are
maybe use one of the unity extracting programs around to extract these directly
from the unity files and have them converted to usable formats during extraction

I made the whole process and could really draw 3d models of the game with their tips, the problem is that when analyzing the bones, meshes and textures are separated and can not unite them. How do I join bones and textures meshes to be able to model the characters?

Detail: I tried all the way to open the texture file but nothing worked really used many programs.



Fiz todo o processo e consegui realmente extrair os modelos 3d do jogo com suas dicas, o problema é que ao analisar os bones, malhas e texturas estão separados e não consigo uni-los. Como faço para unir malhas bones e texturas para conseguir modelar os personagens?

Detalhe: Eu tentei de toda a forma abrir o arquivo de textura mas nada deu certo usei realmente muitos programas.
