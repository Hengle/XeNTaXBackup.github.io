- Post Title: Halo: The Master Chief Collection - font size problem (SOLVED)

In the settings of the game there is some text i translated that doesn't shows correctly like this:

Example for the text near the cursor, it's "HIỆU NĂNG" but the font is too big (i guess) so it couldn't shows correctly.
Since the game uses .ttf for fonts I need any tool to change ttf font size. I did google it but can't find any. Hope someone can help.

Try some tools that are listed on the wiki [http://wiki.xentax.com/index.php/OpenType_Font_TTF_OTF](http://wiki.xentax.com/index.php/OpenType_Font_TTF_OTF)

e.g. High-Logic FontCreator

That's because the character is higher than Win Ascent, so it's cut off
Use Highlogic, Select Font then select Properties
Select Tab Metrics
Then fix Win Ascent
