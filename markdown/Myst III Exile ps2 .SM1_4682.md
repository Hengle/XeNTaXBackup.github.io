- Post Title: Myst III Exile ps2 .SM1

hey, I know this topic was dealt with before, but is there a Quickbms file that can extract the 38 streams from the streams .SM1 archive with filenames, if there are any? I wish to expand on Jack Wall's OST, as the pc files are split up to many layers and segments that require serious reassembly and sequencing to play as one piece. Zench's tool works great, but now I have trouble identifying the tracks without some hard work.

Thanks.

I'll take a look at the file and get back to you.

EDIT: The file does't contain any names.

so why not contacting also him directly?
after all if he has written the tool he knows the format better than anyone else and he is for sure happy if he can improve it
