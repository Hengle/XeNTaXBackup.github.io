- Post Title: Extracting Mad Max game .arc files?

Sorry if this is the wrong place but I've looked eeeverywhere and I'm at my wits end with this.

So I've got the Mad Max game for pc. I want to extract the audio from it, specifically, because it has a ton of audio. Problem is, it seems the game content is kept in a .arc format. Now when I look this up, I either get 1. info about an outdated file type from the 80s or 2. info about unrelated games. I've tried all sorts of things to extract the files, but nothings worked.

The files are located (for me) in C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\SteamApps\common\Mad Max\archives_win64 and are named things like game0.arc. Help? Should I keep trying or is this a hopeless endeavor? again sorry if this is the wrong place for this.

 Is there a program to extract and pack archives of the game. I want to translate December. When I packed translated text via script. the game does not start.
