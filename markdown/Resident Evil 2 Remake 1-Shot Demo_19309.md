- Post Title: Resident Evil 2 Remake 1-Shot Demo

Hi everyone, 

I was wondering if someone could come up with or adapt a previous script to unpack the pak file of the demo? I tied using both the Re7 script for Quickbms and also the specific made tools for Re7 but it didn't work.

I would love to have a look at the polycount, topology, hair, etc of the characters because they look amazing.

Thank you kindly!
