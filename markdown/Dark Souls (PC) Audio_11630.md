If I recall correctly, Dark Souls on PC uses MP3 inside FSB containers.

QuickBMS from Aluigi and AlphaTwentyThree's Dark Souls BMS script will unpack the bdt/bhd5 archive pairs. (Make sure you change the first line from "set X360 1" to "set X360 0" otherwise it will not work.

Fairly sure vgmstream can play MP3 that's packed inside an FSB container. If it cannot, just use FSB Extractor from Aezay to extract the MP3 data

Weird. It's asking for another BMS. "func_getTYPE.bms" Where can I get that and how can I use it with the Dark Souls script?

That's right, you need that script too. Click [here](http://forum.xentax.com/download/file.php?id=6602) to get it.

Just put it in the same place as the other script and it will work fine

I ripped them from the game's files using some script on this forum. It was quite the struggle to figure out how to do it but I ended up ripping all the game's sounds. I use them for creating music 

Now if only I could also find a way to rip Dark Souls 2's audio files...
