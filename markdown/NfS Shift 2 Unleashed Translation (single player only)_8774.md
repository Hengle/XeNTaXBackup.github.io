So, is it possible that the game can be translated and subtitles to be added where there is only audio (for the subtitles i mean in-game, not about in the movies) ?

I don't know where exactly are the language file and that's weird, but i want to translate that game and maybe to do some modding (cars, textures.. etc) if i know "how to" 

Thx in advance if someone answer my question
