- Post Title: [HELP] Opening and converting .bdae files

So I wanted to extract the 3D models from the game Cars Fast As Lightning from Gameloft, but they are in the bdae format, which I do not know how to open, can anybody help me get them or give me a convertor? I want to convert them to .fbx or .obj.

You'll need to find out whether the files are compressed. If so search for ZSTD compression and/or a quickbms script.
