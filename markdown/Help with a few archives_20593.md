- Post Title: Help with a few archives

Hey, guys! So lately, there were a few archives I've been trying to extract (mainly for the sound), but I've had little to no luck with them. I've already made separate threads for them over at ZenHAX, so I figured I could just link to them here. Anyway, the archives giving me trouble are:

[Nurarihyon no Mago: Hyakki Ryouran Taisen bddata.bin (PS3)](https://zenhax.com/viewtopic.php?f=9&t=11466)

[Satsujin Tantei Jack the Ripper data.arc (Switch)](https://zenhax.com/viewtopic.php?f=9&t=11467)

[Yu-Gi-Oh! Legacy of the Duelist: Link Evolution YGO_DATA.dat (Switch)](https://zenhax.com/viewtopic.php?f=9&t=11371)

^I'd be very much grateful for help with even one of the above three! That's all for now!
