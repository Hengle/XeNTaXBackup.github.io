I don't have a copy of the game yet so I can't provide you with any samples atm, but has anyone tried ripping the cars off this? Right now I'm thinking about putting the Yaris and Fiesta to some other game e.g. The Sims or GTA.

Idk if there are tools for this game, anyway i got the model with ninjaripper, works good, the only problem is a pain put in place every car part since are imported all in the middle of the scene.

Are they distorted or incorrectly proportioned though? Would love to have models of the Yaris, Fiesta and at least some of the drivers for a GTA mod or two.

No, are perfect, you have only to set up the uv's scale in ninja ripper settings,because otherwise is too much big, then place every part in the right position.

I see. I could try my hand at ripping them models myself, but could you do one of the Yaris and Fiesta for me please? Couldn't download the game on Steam here at my place right now no thanks to my slow internet connection.

Just tried it out myself, and yeah the parts are all centered, not to mention that the UVs seem to be a little messed up. Any suggestions?
