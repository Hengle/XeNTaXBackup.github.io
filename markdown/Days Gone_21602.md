Days Gone tool.
Supports textures, skeletal meshes, static meshes and maps.

To build a map, first batch-convert all static models (or only models needed for the map). Temporary files will be extracted into "staticmesh.raw" folder. Then drop .umap onto the tool. "staticmesh.raw" folder with raw files must be next to the tool when converting a map.

Note: This game has it different from all other UE4 games i did. Map support is not full:
- only static models supported on the map
- roads and other such things are done with spline meshes, these will be not bent, just placed as is
- some models are done with blueprints, they will be extractable, but not placed on a map









Material names assigned for each submesh:

You probably missed last 2 years of distributing PS4 exclusive data.
Anyone who has the dump is free to send you files.
But your chances increase if you ask in a place where you have some activity, where people know you, what you do, and why do you need it.

Request ChriSS00 
He asked me for these textures today. That's why I share it with everyone.
Normally, the texture has only one look like the image here. [viewtopic.php?p=159463#p159463](https://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?p=159463#p159463)

Texture files --> [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1U89K7y ... sp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1U89K7yeanGJzIwBF5DYZJ-PHP5Xl3UZt/view?usp=sharing)
There is only Diffuse and Normal map.
I increase the resolution of the textures for better quality. 1024x512 --> 4096x2048  You can change the size of the textures as you wish.

Hello folks,

I am currently building Deacon's drifter bike in 1/6 scale.

For the airbrush on the tank I would like to use the texture files as a base.

Does anybody know which .pak file contains the textures for the bike?

I am on PC.

Cheers
