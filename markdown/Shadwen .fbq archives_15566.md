- Post Title: Shadwen .fbq archives

I'm trying to extract some models from Shadwen, the archives appear to be in .fbq format ie same as Trine 2, supposedly Unpakke can open those but I'm having an issue with it. I posted on Unpakke's forum but the last post being from July I don't have much hope for a timely response so I'll copy-paste what I said:

> Just dl'd unpakke, lzflib and the fbq module to unpack files for Shadwen, unpakke doesn't seem to find the module. exact error message: 
>
> [13:22:02] unpakke.exe "modules\" unpack "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Shadwen\model1.fbq" "C:\Users\Jasmine\Desktop\Skyrim modding\Shadwen export"

> [13:22:02] Cannot load module: modules\
