- Post Title: Acrophobia .srf

The game I'm requesting for is the old Acrophobia game published by Bezerk.  The file format is *.srf, which I thought would be like the You Don't Know Jack version (by the same publisher), but MultiEx comes back with an empty list.

Samples: http://uglycat.sprawling.org/bezerk-acr ... dir/Music/
Program: http://uglycat.sprawling.org/bezerk-acr ... oSetup.exe (this will install, but the game will not run because the server is defunct)
All *.srf files from the game: http://uglycat.sprawling.org/bezerk-acr ... ia-srf.zip

This is really a one-off, because the game in question is very much defunct and all I'm trying to do is extract the sounds (and maybe graphics if possible) to build a clone.  In fact, I wouldn't even be asking about this, but this game was a classic with great (if slightly lo-fi) music and I'd like to be able to incorporate the old media into a skin for the new Acro game I'm trying to design.

Thanks -- dro

EDIT:  I also just dug up the installer for another Bezerk game, What's The Big Idea?, which I believe uses the same format...

Samples: http://uglycat.sprawling.org/bezerk-big ... ces/Music/
Program: http://uglycat.sprawling.org/bezerk-big ... aSetup.exe (again, this will install, but the game will not run because the server is defunct)

I could find some sort of index in the files, which stores it's data big endian way btw. It all seems kind of scrambled however.

Anyway, for the moment, you might try for example Strobe's [Jaeder Naub](http://wiki.xentax.com/index.php/Jaeder_Naub) to extract parts of the files. At least I found two WAV-files in Sfx.srf (sound effects probably).
