Here is the file:

[https://userscloud.com/tworpeorgzjx](https://userscloud.com/tworpeorgzjx)

I export with Gildor's Umodel but only I have two TARGA files.

[http://www.gildor.org/downloads](http://www.gildor.org/downloads) 

I can't edit these files. As far as i am understand these files can't edit like fonts.

These files can edit like picture but not like TTF or any font files.
