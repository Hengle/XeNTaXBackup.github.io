- Post Title: .anm.hkx converting.

I tried to convert .anm.hkx from Sonic Unleashed to be used in 3ds max, but I can't. Someone told me to use xcmopress with quicbms, but that didn't work. Is there a xdecompress or something that I can use to convert them? I asked him for his since his worked, but he said he didn't have it. So, can anyone help, please? Thanks!
