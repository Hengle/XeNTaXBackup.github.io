- Post Title: Extracting sounds from .opuspak files [Cyberpunk 2077]

The purpose of this console application (.NET) I created is to extract sounds from .opuspak files found in Cyberpunk 2077 soundbanks.
The results are .wem audio files that can be played and converted with foobar2000 + vgmstream plugin.

Hope it helps. Happy extracting.  

ps. I managed to get those pretty sfx from UI of the game

I would love to be able to get the names too. Otherwise you find yourself with 50k+ "useless" audio files.

Can we convert the files without the folders?
