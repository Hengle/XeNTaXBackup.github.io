- Post Title: Need Help Finding/Extracting PSP Game Audio

Hot Shots Golf: Open Tee 1/2 on PSP. Cant identify where or how to extract the voice files in game. Everything is in .XB format if that helps. I can upload a shot of what folder I think the voices are located in? Its a very simple game directory (the first game).

Ah, I was going to post in here then about the XB files after I posted a thread on a now gone ZenHAX back in 2022, the only difference it was from the PS2 game which is HSG3 but it uses the same format. (A guy from PS2 subreddit asked for help).
Unfortunately, last time I've checked it was compressed with an unknown algorithm and will require reverse-engineering the game which I don't think I'll be able to.

Yea I think I saw your response minutes before posting here. So there isnt anyway then? Guess ill hold out for maybe someone else who knows? Not even sure the audio files are in that particular folder. I cant even tell until were able to literally open one of the files at all, you know.

Yeah, until someone's figures the compression algorithm of those XB files then the extraction is impossible. Also I think the game didn't uncompress them on the memory either, so obtaining it via the emulator's savestates/RAM dump is out of the question too.

And yes, the XB file is actually the sound file.
