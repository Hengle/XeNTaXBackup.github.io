- Post Title: The Sims 2 (PS2) textures?

Supposedly this game has a boatload of unused stuff, and most of it is in the textures. I got somebody (aluigi) to extract the .ARC files, but the textures have no extension to them. I will attach a few textures that were extracted, and if anybody can make a program that can convert these to .PNG, or .JPG, then please do.

Link to zipped folder with 5 different textures:

Check out Dageron's [Console Texture Explorer](http://dageron.com/?page_id=2535&lang=en). It'll help you extract textures from PS2 games:

Seems to me this program works, but not entirely. The textures which I tried didn't work, unfortunately. The program does display stuff, but it is mostly a pixelated mess.

Can you send some more samples? Preferably larger ones, since it's somewhat difficult to make anything from the ones in the OP.

Try to turn on or disable swizzling, check both cases.
Also if your texture is not 4bpp or 8bpp this tool seems to be useless.

Sorry to bump the thread, but does anyone have a tutorial of some sort that will help me determine the offset of the image and such?

seriously?
The picture in my previous post should show all you need.
The offset 65 (dec.) is addr 0x41.

Yes, seriously. The offset shown works for that one image, but the others, no. I am terrible with hex editors. I'll attach one of the images I'm trying to figure out;

the offsets vary a little bit depending on the length of the texture name which starts at 0x10:

Where can I download this Console Texture explorer [psp/ps2] ?

I'm trying to open Need for Speed Carbon: Own the City files from PSP and Zeebo.
