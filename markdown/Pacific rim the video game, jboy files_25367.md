- Post Title: Pacific rim the video game, jboy files

I extract the pac files to where I managed to get the textures but I can't access the jboy files from what I've seen they are a type of file derived from yobj probably mesh or something like that, what I inform doesn't help much I'm quite layman in this but here are the files if anyone can help me open

Extra: if anyone is interested in making a script to import here are all the .jboy variations of the game

look it's been a while man thanks for the plugin but i'll have to ask you one thing it would be possible to load them with rig i believe i found it would be the bones list or something like that    ".root"

Samples:[https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Kzlo4I ... sp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Kzlo4I54sc4beUIn2a7CMEXFtZGc3-Xr/view?usp=sharing)

it opens normally for me, check if you don't have the right jboy plugin there are two the pacific rim one is the real steel one, don't put the two scripts in the noesis folder the first one you put will give preference and it won't work remove the pacific rim jboy plugin folder should read normally

dude has a topic just for real steel -_- it's no wonder that durik didn't answer you after so many days

Dude, I doubt anyone wants more than the characters in these games the plugin doesn't have to be 100%, it just has to load the uv and the bones to be honest with pacific rim your plugin basically saved the lost models because the only thing what was on them on the internet were models ripped with old ripper that were built into the ps3 they basically didn't have the uv

Can you update the script to load bones and weights?
