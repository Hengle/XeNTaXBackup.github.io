- Post Title: SmackDown! Here Comes The Pain

I know this is probably a very old topic, that has been already discussed but I cannot seem to figure out how to import 3D Character models onto my computer in CAD file format.  I understand I am to put the actual PlayStation 2 game into my computer disc drive, and then open up the file that says Ch.pac and Ch2.pac.  Then I think I am supposed to use Rrunpack to change these files into YOBJ format, and then the extractor program to convert these into OBJ files.  I cannot figure out how to do it though so can anybody PLEASE help provide step to step instructions for the whole process? (along with links to any of the programs like rrunpack that I will have to download)
THANK YOU SO MUCH!
