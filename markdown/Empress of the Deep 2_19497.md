- Post Title: Empress of the Deep 2

I'm trying to get all images from Empress of the Deep 2 so i can edit them but with both Unity Asset Bundle Extractor and unity assets explorer v 1.5 I have problems. UAE says TProgressBar property out of range. And with UABE says that the database is 3.3.0f4 and can't export as png files or tga. I'll add the file bellow.

With AssetStudio i can extract all images but how can i put them back?
