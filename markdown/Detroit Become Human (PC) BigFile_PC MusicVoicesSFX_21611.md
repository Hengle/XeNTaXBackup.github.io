You can easily extract the sound files from the large BigFile_PC files with Dragon Unpacker's HRipper. You can get a lot wav files from each one of BigFile_PC, but they're actually Wwise Custom Vorbis and can be easily converted with ww2ogg. Should be up to 100000 individual sound bytes in total, if you're willing to sweep through all of them.
