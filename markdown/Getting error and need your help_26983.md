"I require assistance in opening the file named ""pl_g_nin.i3d"" using Noesis with the ""Rule of Rose"" plugin. Unfortunately, I am encountering an error message that states the detected file type is ""Rule of Rose (PS2)"" and provides a traceback with the following details:
Traceback (most recent call last):
File ""C:\Users\User\Pictures\fin\New folder\New folder\plugins\python\fmt_RuleOfRose(PS2)_i3d.py"", line 27, in noepyLoadModel
bs.seek(boneChunkAddress, NOESEEK_ABS). I would greatly appreciate any assistance or guidance on resolving this issue. Thank you in advance."
