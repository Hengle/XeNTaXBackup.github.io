How to extract audio files
I've been having a headache for half a month. I hope you can help.
I used dzs-qq.bms to unlock VFS. I've got a lot of FSB files, but I can't pull them out of other forums successfully. I need help, help me.


This is one of the files.ï¼š[https://mega.nz/#!iKoB2QgK!gUqyMkqFkeKP ... EbWzi8LjXU](https://mega.nz/#!iKoB2QgK!gUqyMkqFkeKPuMVjLDrmKZxGnES6JUkFLEbWzi8LjXU)

Which brother helps me?

I beg your brothers to help me. I really don't understand how to unpack my code. I hope I can provide tools.

I tried unpacking with an unpacker, and most of the other audio extracted from VFS was valid, except for a few wavs that couldn't be played, and the audio files inside the file I uploaded were entirely empty without sound waves.
