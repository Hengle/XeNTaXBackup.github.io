- Post Title: Requesting Assistance

This post half represents what I'm trying to do in this thread but also in some other uses, I'm so desperate to complete the assignment I set my self I have posted this in many forums around the world, hopefully out of some of those places someone will be able to help me out 

[That form thread](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?t=2582)

Here is my main assignment

I'm a fairly experienced modifier who works on modifying heaps of games, I have worked on developing some pretty interesting and amazing modifications however I do lack in the area in creating tools and this is something I want to do so much and so badly. So I think the first place for me to start is to start learning things like C / C++ but I’m not quite sure how I should approach learning this form of scripting language.

My main purposes for creating tools is to create a program which can open up games archives so files can be both imported and exported. I have noticed a few applications out there for the games I wish to mod however the tools do lack many features and can be very hard to use. So I hope someone here also has some experience creating applications which can both export and import in game archives.

I have noticed many of these programs have been created with an executable and a batch file however these programs do lack eye candy and ease of use so this would be something I would not be interested in letter my fellow modifiers to use.

So basically I wish to learn the basics of C / C++ and I’d like some support in creating an eye candy application which will enable users to import and export files in game archives.

Does anyone here think they could offer any support or assistance? If so please contact me within this forum, via. Email at [madness.productions@gmail.com](mailto:madness.productions@gmail.com) and/or contact me via. msn with the address [madness.productions@gmail.com](mailto:madness.productions@gmail.com) so you could possibly walk me through a few processes and steps.

Thanks for your Time

Well, perhaps if there's enough interest, we could open new forum section "Game specific modding" and you could start a Driver thread there. 

As for tools, you obviously have seen all the extractors/importers listed at the GFFC ( [http://wiki.xentax.com](http://wiki.xentax.com) ), one of which is MultiEx Commander (MexCom), naturally. Tools such as MexCom aim at supporting a wide range of games for importation, and in essence a script or plugin could add support for any type of DRIV3R file. This aim at supporting many games will result in features that may not be game-specific enough for your liking however. 

Concerning eye candy, I do think that eye candy should be the least of anyone's concern if he is to create a tool for people who wish to mod games, as the features should be recieving most attention.  

What you would want is to create a dedicated tool for each game you wish to mod. This way you can really focus on implemeting features that are of relevance to each particular game. Worry about eye candy much later, though, too much eye candy get's totally in the way of the tool, a tool should work, not just look good. 

As for your question regarding the donation to become a Friend of MultiEx, I do not think $5 AU = $8.75 ? Anyway, there are more ways to support the MultiEx project than donation, perhaps you can offer support in another way if you do not wish to donate? Check for instance [viewtopic.php?t=1235](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?t=1235) .
