This file looks like a database file, but I think it's not a standard one (at least I couldn't open it with any database editor).
Is it editable somehow?
Thanks is advance.

Huge thanks! I remembered, that I should try the db editor, which worked for Drakensang, but couldn't remember the name. Thanks again!
