I really need help on unpacking/extracting this DAT file.
It's from the game Way of the samurai 2 (PS2).
Need to extract the following file formats from VOLUME.DAT:
 *.SX (script/text)
 *.BPM (image file? what program to use?)

Please help me...
Thanks!

It's the TOC, nothing relevant x)
No one can help if they don't know what you need, and yes, if you need help on the volume.dat, share it.

Ok... thanks for your reply.
It's my first time to do a request.
I just need it to translate a Japanese game.
Been thru Googling but still not found a good unpacker.

Here's the link to my file:

Thanks again, looking forward for your next replies.
