Until the bms script is done, there won't be any script to import models.

Not yet.

Supposedly the file format is obac. Here's a file extracted with the latest bms script if someone is interested:

[http://www.mediafire.com/file/199a1p2iar6u5pb/MAI.rar](http://www.mediafire.com/file/199a1p2iar6u5pb/MAI.rar)

The file seems to be not encrypted.

The script's working but I'm having some issues with a few models pertaining to their mat ID's. I'm releasing the script anyway because this is something that could be manually fixed anyway. When the normals are applied the model's lighting looks weird too and I don't know how to subvert that. If you don't want to wait a decade for the model to load in max just comment out line 355.

The weights imported with no issues. If you want to open the mouth without breaking the face you have to move both bones C_JawHalf_FbD and C_Jaw_FbD.

Just curious... what version of Max does the script work on?

I believe it should run in at least for the 2011 version of max but I wrote the script for the 2015 version.

Cracker, some models have problems with facial rig, even If I move both jaw bones. Whip has problems with a few fingers where a few vetices are assigned to another bone, those were easy to fix manually.





Those are Whip and Kyo classic costume (GRN).

Apparently there are up to 8 bind weights per vertex instead of the traditional 4.

Lol Thanks. I jope you can fix normals becuase is a pain to clean hair meshes and sometimes there are polygons that are not stcked togehter with a complete mesh.

Another question, are you gonna add stage mesh support??.

Set UVset to 2 in line 324 and you'll get the second uv layer for decals.

Here is an importer for animations and an updated model importer script to work with the animation files. Animation importing works only about 90% of the time, sometimes breaking the models. It's been some time since I've encountered this problem and I can't figure out how to fix it. I don't think I'll work on this any longer but I think its current state will suit the public.

Hi there, thanks for these scripts, killercracker, but, can I ask something?

Could you please do an alternate scripts for those who got used to work with 32(86) bits systems instead of 64 bits ones?

Beforehand, thank you and keep going with those scripts, pal!

@killercracker 
do you have plans to create an Export script , so we can import custom models into the game ? 

It would really help with the modding of the game  .
