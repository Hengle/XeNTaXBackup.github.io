You can't just "get it". You need to buy it in the asset store first 
[https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/t ... tion-14884](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/localization/i2-localization-14884)
and then probably add it to your Unity project.

I found this version, and it's free but I don't know how to use it, seems like a plugin and you need another program to work.
