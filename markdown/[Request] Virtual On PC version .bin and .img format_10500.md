- Post Title: [Request] Virtual On PC version .bin and .img format

Dug up my old copy of Virtual On's PC port and thought at least one person on the forums other than myself would get a kick out of having Virtual On models. A Google search turned up nothing in regards to tools or even anything relevant to the subject, so I figured I would ask here.

I've narrowed down the probable file types to 3, the Rb_*.bin files might be mesh data (probably multiple models, like effect meshes for explosions and whatnot), Mt_*.bin is probably animation (but might contain model data or at the least the default rig for each character) and the .img containers seem to be the game's textures.

Any takers?

Derp, probably should have posted the files sample: [https://www.dropbox.com/s/mf1esmslmifxbof/Virtu-on.7z](https://www.dropbox.com/s/mf1esmslmifxbof/Virtu-on.7z)
