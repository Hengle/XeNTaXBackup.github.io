- Post Title: Spider-Man Shattered Dimensions and Edge of Time .dat files

We from the MarvelMods community are trying to get into these files. They are too big to post, but here is all the info I could find on them.

The archives apparently contain raw PCM tracks with the specs saved in the TOC.

Apparently, Beenox XBOX 360 version games use XMA audio contained inside the Streams.dat archive, while the Wii versions use DSP and the PS2 version Sony ADPCM.

Apparently the Wave Scanner script works on Amazing Spider-Man 2 but I couldn't get it to work for either of these games.

In the PC version of Shattered Dimensions, there are cab files on the disc instead of the .dat files that are the same names as the .dat files.

Here are some threads about these .dat files, in these and other Beenox games.

I'm really at a loss here. Does anyone have any ideas?

I tested all versions of these except the 360 ones and they all use these .dat archive types. Still no idea how to open them.

I don't think the TOC is a separate file/files. That's just what some information I found online said. I had hoped someone else knew what "TOC" meant. And I had hoped that with as much info as I provided via those links, someone read through them and could have an idea on how to help and I could avoid upload these very massive files. Since that's hasn't turned out to be the case, here's the links.
I'll probably have to pull the files and remove the links in couple months (so, end of February) if there isn't any action on this. 
Sorry, but for files this massive, that's all I can do.

Here's the Edge of Time Streams.dat (800mb):
[https://www.mediafire.com/file/lfcvhjds ... s.dat/file](https://www.mediafire.com/file/lfcvhjds2rl1wv3/Streams.dat/file)

Here's the the Shattered Dimensions Streams.dat (2.6 gb):

[https://www.mediafire.com/file/ebjoknnt ... s.dat/file](https://www.mediafire.com/file/ebjoknntbv7rf64/Streams.dat/file)

Hopefully this can finally get solved, as there have been so many false starts and abandoned attempts online by various people over the years.

> I don't think the TOC is a separate file/files. That's just what some information I found online said. I had hoped someone else knew what "TOC" meant.

TOC is just short name for "Table of Contents" which is a part of the archive for storing offsets, file sizes etc.
In most cases TOC is placed on the beginning/end of the archive and it's structure is simple, so it's easy to extract data. But in the zenhax topic you have linked there is a work-in-progress script which basically tells you that in this case file format is pretty complicated.


By the way, you can use google drive or mega.nz for storing massive files.

I humbly suggest reuploading the .dat files so we can look at it later.

While I very much appreciate the interest after all this time, I simply do not have the space to leave both of these incredibly large .dat files up on my MediaFire indefinitely in the hopes someone will eventually want to take a look. I left them up until March, as I said I would, which is 2 months, without really much interest.
I have reuploaded the smaller of the 2 .dat files, which is the EOT one. I'll leave it up until April. 
(Edge of Time streams.dat = 800mb vs Shattered Dimensions streams.dat = 2.6gb)
If you or anyone is really serious about this, let me know and I can upload the other one.
Again, I'm sorry, but due to the size of these files, and the lack of interest, this is the best I can do.
If your interest in these is more of a casual interest, these can be gotten other ways than me.
Thanks again for your interest, I do really appreciate it.

Once again - mega.nz gives you 50 GB of free storage and google drive gives you 15 GB of free storage. All of it can be stored as long as you wish.

Not to mention that there are many, many alternatives

Thanks so much for trying anyway.
Sadly, no, there's no news. And it doesn't look like there's going to be any news. There's just not that much interest, I guess. With 15 downloads of the file since I reuploaded it, and that's with threads both here and zenhax.
I really appreciate anyone who tried, but it's pretty clear there just isn't the interest in this I thought there would be. 
I've got to pull the link. I need the space on Mediafire too badly.
There are other ways to get the files anyway.
If anyone has any ideas, please post them here so this can finally get solved.
I will, of course, do the same.

This is the Streams.dat from the Xbox 360 Prototype of Spider-Man Shattered Dimensions.
It is only 78mb in the z7 archive and extracts to 87mb.
This is much much much smaller and is at the very least an easier file to host long term.
Do with it what you will.
Please post here if you try.
Thank you.

So, I refer those interested to think link:

It'll work, but I'm not sure if it gets it all.
Make sure to use PS3 Disc Decrypter first on the discs of both games, as those are the only methods that worked to decrypt them, for some unknown reason.
One thing's for sure, it'll take me a long time to sort through all this audio.

Anyone can help extracting the European versions?
