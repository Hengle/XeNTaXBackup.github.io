- Post Title: Asking for Live2D extracts from Revue Starlight RE:LIVE.

Just as the title says.

Game name is Revue Starlight RE:LIVE. [https://play.google.com/store/apps/deta ... w&hl=en_US](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=jp.co.atm.smile.ww&hl=en_US)

I've attempted looking through the apk with only an unzipper and Windows File Explorer, but with no luck. I have no clue what I'm doing and would appreciate any kind of help!
