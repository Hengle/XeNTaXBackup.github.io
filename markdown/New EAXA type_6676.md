- Post Title: New EA/XA type?

I can't seem to convert this EA XA segment attahed below from the ps3 version of NFS carbon which is very high quality on the ps3 and sems to support 6ch as well. Although i have  a 2ch 48hz segment with a header the sx.exe tool doesn't work.

Also tried ealayer3 tool by zench but doesn't seem to work either.

Anybody can look at this segment then thanks.
