I suspect this file holds the texts for the game. Could anybody help me with unpacking/packing the archive?

[http://dl.dropbox.com/u/5130280/DataEn.pak](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/5130280/DataEn.pak)

Thank you in advance.

What? Isn't there a SpeechEn.pak file in the same folder as the Data ones... Also it's using Chrome Engine 5.

EDIT:
Alright, since Dead Island is available for preload on steam, I got some files that could be storing meshes and weapons. But they're in an .rpack file...

Here are some samples:

Posting data from a Steam preload is pointless: the data is encrypted until release day.

Call of Juarez The Cartel uses the same engine and also uses .rpack.

But Call of Juarez The Cartel uses a file hash protection or something, cause when you edit some file, the game
stop of work. Even if you rename an another lang file to EN this happens.

I've tried here, taking DataES.pak, renamed to DataEN.pak.

The game crashes.

I'm also interested in translation of this game.
I hope you guys can figure out what format it is, and make a tool.

So the game is out, and here is the decrypted DataEn.pak, which can be extracted with 7-zip or WinRAR, but don't know what to do afterwards.

Yeah, .PAK files can be extracted by using WinZip (you can simply change extension to .zip)
In Data1 we have Maps folder, but there are more files that I can't extract.. I'm looking for maps in probably .dds
And I'm not sure what exactly can we find in .RPack files

In the *.pak - files are "only" *.scr - files, and some other files. Open it in a hexeditor and you see scripts.

The texures, i think, are in the *.rpack - files.

Same shit than in "Call of Juarez - The Cartel".

Can someone find a way to build an unpacker-packer(-repacker).

thx

The "DataEn.pak" I posted earlier contains a file called "DI Voices&Texts.bin". Supposedly this contains the texts for the game. An unpacker/repacker would be welcome

As I've tested, the game doesn't seem to read from extracted files, no matter where I put them, so maybe we have to repack them into .pak. Anyone know how to do that?

Yes, updated version of the game check the files with hash or something. 
This way is impossible to do any mod. Can someone take a look at this?

The same thing happens with Call of Juarez: The Cartel. (both developed on Chrome Engine 5)

A lot of people wanna translate those games into their languages. I hope someone can help.

to bypass modified *.pak check, we can patch 2 bytes in engine_x86_rwdi.dll. Open that dll in favorite hex-editor and search for FFD684DB, and change 84DB to B301, then save dll and run game with modified *.pak.
P.S. it`s the simple way

To translate the Game, TEXT ONLY, extract the "DI Voices&Texts.bin" - file from ""DataEn.pak.

Open it in your favorit HEX-editor, find the right format (sorry i have not look for it) to fix the points betwen the letters, and translate.

Have anyone find a way to change teh textures. Maybe a unpacker + packer to build a "custom-update-file".

mod of dll is not perfect, I tried chnge the file text MD Text&Voices.bin from DaraES.pak to the DataEn.pak, the game opened, and the title screen appeared in Spanish, but in time to open the menu, it also closed.

Any idea what might be?

I build tools for my use, and I do not use UIs for tools such as FixZip as I use batch scripting to automate their usage.

The ability to use command-line tools is a necessary facet of modding.

Instead of Re-Hashing the pak files to match the engine, you can try placing the scr and bin files directly in the Documents\DeadIsland\Out\Data folder and the game should read them as override files.

It works for modding the Game as outlined in this epic thread here [http://forums.steampowered.com/forums/s ... ?t=2106453](http://forums.steampowered.com/forums/showthread.php?t=2106453) so it should work for the Translation changes you guys are trying to make as well.

Rick, any chance you've had a look at the rpack files so we can start modifying the Textures for this?

you can extract all compressed data in the rpack files with offzip. But you should add manually header of files. And I found the file names in rpack files. Someone can make a tool easily.

Ŝ Unicode is the 015C.
However, it is converted to 005C.
※005C = \
015C,025C,035C...FF5C, Both are converted 005C.
Could this problem be fixed?

Fixed.

Drag and drop the .bin file on the DeadIslandBIN.exe. Should I explain drag and drop?:)
When you are ready, drag and drop the directory on DeadIslandBIN.exe.

And please, no need to SHOUT!

Good but how to repack the text again?

(It's so easy to write a ReadMe file and attach it with the tool)

I tried to drag&drop the unpacked text file (DI Voices&Texts.bin.txt) but no luck.

And how i can edit the .scr files inside the DataEn.pak without game crash?

----

Other question: Any chance for tool that can unpack the .rpack archives or no?

Again drag&drop bin file not txt file. or you can create a .cmd file.
First open pack file with WinRar,WinZip or 7zip.
First open a txt file and paste that into it and save as .cmd file. type "afilename.cmd" select extension as all files.

```
DeadIslandBIN.exe "DI Voices&Texts.bin"
```

run cmd file first to extract and run again after editing txt file to repack.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

for .rpack files, you can extract them,but I dont how to repack them.
download that: [http://aluigi.altervista.org/mytoolz/offzip.zip](http://aluigi.altervista.org/mytoolz/offzip.zip)
create a cmd file again using that arguments:

```
offzip -a [archieve_name] [output_folder] 0

```

for example:

```
offzip -a menu_common_PC.rpack unpack 0

```


and extensions are not correct. because this program just find extracts them.

Game does not read font files from pak files. It reads from .rpack files. I found some font filenames in that files:
menu2_common_PC.rpack
menu2_ingame_net_PC.rpack
menu2_ingame_single_PC.rpack
menu_common_PC.rpack
menu_ingame_net_PC.rpack
menu_ingame_single_PC.rpack
Also, I extracted find headerless font files with my aforementioned way, but I dont know how to repack rpack files. I think there is no filechecks for rpack files as there is pak files.

Thanks so much for this tool! Works great I would have gone crazy trying to edit with hex editor.

also, is there no way around breaking the file by adding new lines? maybe an additional file needs to be changed

I think also so,  because there = operator to determine lines places in game.

I want to translate the texts but the game is missing some chars (ă Ă â Â î Î ş Ş ţ Ţ), any idea how can i add them in game. I found some fonts files here 'dead island\DI\Data0.pak\Data\Panel\' but i'm not sure which files needs to be modified.

you should edit three dds file only,

franklin gothic.....dds  for this edit franklin gothic.fm file that has chars coordinates from dds file
fl prismo......dds for this fl prismo.. fm file.
llrubber.....dds  for this llrubber 22 and 32 edit both .fm file
after editing move these .fm files into Panel older near to .bin language files in DataEn.pak file, game will read these one over Data0,1,2.pak files.

dds but inject those into rpack files.
fl prismo......dds to menu2_ingame_net_PC.rpack
other two dds file into  menu2_common_PC.rpack file.
you can check a topic in compressed file section in this forum.

But if you want to replace orginal chars , to not add new characters to new place in dds file, You do not need to edit .fm files. Just edit dds file and inject those into rpack files.

afx01
offzip=zlib; just like said chrrox
Cut zlibed blocks "starts 78 DA ends before many zeros" from rpack and decompress. Edit and then compress it and insert into rpack. Size of edited/compressed blocks must be same.

And this is my research *.fm file.

```

val1=CharID;
val2=CharWidth;
val3=PosX;
val4=PosY;
val5=TexWidth,LtoR;
val6=TexHeight,UtoD;
val7=CharHeight;
val8=unknown; maybe kerning pairs
```

When we drag&drop DI Voices&Texts on DeadIslandBIN for the second time it creates a .bin2 file. When I delete .bin2, write .bin and create a .pak file with these. The game doesn't get start. I don't know what to do, what do I do wrong? I have tried this for 7-8 times since last night.
