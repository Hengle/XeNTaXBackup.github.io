I had that one for some time. Trying to figure out how is it working and what's in it. I do not think though it has such a features like shifting palette colors by the bunch of indexes at the time. 

The project I am struggling with is how to reflect changing colors of the fixed palette of the terrain set depending on variable light intensity and color conditions of passing TOD (Time of the Day). 
Of course, with modern DX games to accomplish this is not so hard, but the older fixed palette games had that never done quite right. 

Thanks for you help - still need more.
