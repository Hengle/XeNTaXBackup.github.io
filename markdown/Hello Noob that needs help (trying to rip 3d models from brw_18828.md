Hello all
Im  very  new to this  so i don't  quite get it .I'm also not that bright. But  dose any one know of any  plugins or peace of software that can  help me rip 3d models from my  web  browser. I  use  chrome and i  have  ninja ripper. With  ripper im  not  sure  what  to add in for the first bar. Like i  tried to  add chrome to  it. But  it  just says failed. I also dont  know what  wrap to use on  it  to get the  models.
Any  help  would be  great. thank  you
