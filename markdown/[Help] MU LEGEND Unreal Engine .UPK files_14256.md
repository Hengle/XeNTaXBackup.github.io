Heyy!  Drawing, can you check this file in your umodel please! It shows a message that is encrypted, I tried with a tool called Mu2Viewer and it works, but doesn't load all the meshes that this .upk have, the best way should be unpack this .upk and make it openable with umodel, but I have not succeeded yet.    Thank you!

Hi moon. I can't open them , umodel message:
"Wrong package tag (6A8B57C7) in file Wea_Twohandhammer.upk. Probably the file is encrypted."

I've 0 knowledge in decrypting so I can't help you. It' s a pity because models of this game are really awesome but for gidlor it's just " another asian game".
