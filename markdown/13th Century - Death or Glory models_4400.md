Tosyk,

The 3D Object Converter supports this file type for  load.
[http://web.t-online.hu/karpo](http://web.t-online.hu/karpo)

Please install the v4.40 or use the v4.40 portable version.
After that you must upgrade to v4.417 using the Help/Check for updates... function.

I uploaded the converted files in Wavefront .obj/mtl format to my web page:

Unfortunately I don't have this game and I don't have a full model (3d model + its texture file).
I wrote this loader module based on your sample files, but it loads the UV texture coords from the .oss file and it writes to the .obj file.

Can you upload the texture files for your (uploaded) sample files ?

Tosyk,

The 3D Object Converter supports the .osm and the .oss file formats for load.
[http://web.t-online.hu/karpo](http://web.t-online.hu/karpo)

Please install the v4.40 or use the v4.40 portable version.
After that you must upgrade to v4.418 using the Help/Check for updates... function.

See this nice gallery (original .osm and the converted Wavefront .obj/mtl files):

Why is your program does not support the bones, they are difficult to interpret / understand? Or what?

It would be very useful!
