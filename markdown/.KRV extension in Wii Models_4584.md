- Post Title: .KRV extension in Wii Models?

I am trying to get the models from 'how to train your dragon' and 'alice in wonderland' out of the game, but most of the files are .krv and I have no clue what those do. Can anyone tell me how to get usable 3d models out of those files?

Thanks

Both of those games were developed by Etranges Libellule, (EDIT) They also use .KP2 (K Playstation 2) files in Spyro: Dawn of the Dragon for the PS2. If they are anything related to those, then each level will have it own KRV (K (Nintendo) Revolution)  file(s) which will contain all of the assets for that level.  There should be a list of file address offsets near the beginning.  Can you upload a file from How to train your dragon, so I can attempt to get models from it

Thanks for the fast reply ^^ If you manage to get stuff out of it, can you tell me how you did it so I can check the rest as well? 

Can't upload those directly into here it seems (they do not like .krv and it is just a tad to big as rar), but you can download it here to see if it works: [http://www.mediafire.com/?cj0atzqzw2g](http://www.mediafire.com/?cj0atzqzw2g)

This file comes from 'LVL1' apparently and there are several more of these small files along with a 17 MB one...

The file you uploaded is compressed, but it is just a renamed zip file so you can change the extension to .zip and then extract it.  This file only has some png textures, probably just the graphics from the title screen judging from the names of the files like tyd0.png
Could you upload the 17MB file as that is most likely to have models in it, or even better a 17MB or larger file from same LVL2 as in some games the first "level" is just a title screen or a cutscene that will not contain any models.

None of the links above work for me.  i'll see if i can find some, but if you have sample files, i'll take a look.

Hey FurryFan,

I see you're using blender to load the tri-strips. I'm slightly proficient with python, but I'm not familiar with the loading of tri-strips. Could you post the script you used for that import?
Also, what did you mean by "98 2ByteInteger#Vertexes"? Did you mean there are 98 uint16 index values or the byte '0x98' followed by a uint16 'number of vertices' ? 

Here's the very broken script I'm using to (try and) locate the vertex data. Basically I'm using HexEdit to find a candidate for some float3's, then skipping ahead in the file with a skip_bytes variable then reading in 10 triangles out of them. Needless to say, I'm not finding much.

-Q13
Oh I do not know any scripts, the way that I import tristrips of the type used in this game is by using microsoft word, to past in the tristrips and then add in a "00 00" in between strips strips in this seem to start with the hex byte "98" so I do find and replace all in microsoft word, which will not work all the time because not all 98 are strip starters hence the dragon in the picture is not filled in correctly. After I do the replacements I append it 3 times, removing no bytes, the firstbyte, then the second byte and paste it in an ogre3d file with the vertexes and then import using someone else's ogre3dxml importer mesh into blender. Then I delete the vertex at the first location and then the thousands of null ones at 0,0,0.
I use excel formulas to change the edninan into the other edinan type.

Well, thanks FurryFan, I'll try to follow your work-flow, then adapt a blender importer for it... eventually. <)

tri-strip is easy to load.
just read them as triangle list values like so.


```
f1 = (ReadBEword f) + 1 
f2 = (ReadBEword f) + 1   
FaceDirection = StartDirection 
while (ftell f) != (FaceStartPos + (FaceCount * 2))Do ( 
f3 = (ReadBEword f) 
if (f3==0xFFFF) then ( 
f1 = (ReadBEword f) + 1 
f2 = (ReadBEword f) + 1 
FaceDirection = StartDirection    
) else ( 
f3 += 1 
FaceDirection *= -1 
if (f1!=f2)AND(f2!=f3)AND(f3!=f1) then ( 
if FaceDirection > 0 then append Face_array [(f1),(f2),(f3)] 
else append Face_array [(f1),(f3),(f2)] 
) 
f1 = f2 
f2 = f3 
)   
) 
```

chrrox while we are on the topic of tristrips do you know of a script that can export meshes as implicit tristrips where the strip is in order (00, 01,02,03,04...N) where vertexes can repeat (ie vertex #4 could be vertex#55) so that the sequenital tristrip spans the whole mesh.
This could be used to inject meshes  into this game, as models in this game could be just one long strip in theory.

```

Is there a different Ogre mesh.xml file structure or is there some trick you're using to selectively paste these verts into this structure? Sorry, I don't know how these are imported yet, so I'm not sure if just dumping the contents of <vertexbuffer> </vertexbuffer> will work, but I'm about to try.

I first use an empty ogre3d binary mesh (I got a mesh from a now defunct Spore Creature Model viewer converter but you can download a mesh shell with 1-4000 vertex tristrips (its tripled so it is doubled sided) from my website: [http://ps23dformat.wikispaces.com/file/ ... odel1.mesh](http://ps23dformat.wikispaces.com/file/view/blankmodel1.mesh)
The tristrip index is at offset 0x2D and could go up to offset 0x2F140
The vertexes data is stored as Vertex#1POS, Vertex#1NormalMapping, Vertex#1UVMap, Vertex#2POS....
The vertexes start at offset 0x2F195, and goes until offset 0xF1254

A sample file which is the same file above but with vertexes is [http://ps23dformat.wikispaces.com/file/view/car.mesh](http://ps23dformat.wikispaces.com/file/view/car.mesh)
It is a Water Buffalo model that is completely one single tristrip, I think the UV coords are in it too, and maybe normal mapping. Otherwise you would delete the vertex at 0,0,0 and/or the vertex at the first position if you deliminate different tristrips by zeros in the face list or vertex list.

FurryFan,

Wow, thanks! That looks highly useful. 
Got the pm, too.  I'll try to digest this tonight and see what I can come up with.

Sooo...
You're right, that's a rather sheepish looking water buffalo, not a car.  So I've finagled blender into importing .xml files and found the OGRE tools for the .mesh to .xml step.  I tested with your car.mesh, FurryFan, and found the buffalo!  Now looking at the car.mesh file I see the face index counting up from 1 to 0xff0f (LE I assume), but I'm having trouble locating a corresponding index list in the Her_ file from my game disk.

```

This is the first occurrence (out of 90) in this file, and the first couple of uint16s might make sense:49696,  8200, 43449. But this is a rather small file compared to others and its name is 'Her_Astri_Axe' so I'm thinking its an axe. (It might be the Astrid model with an axe, but why on earth would they do that?)
So I guess my question is if this sounds right: I take some of the tri-face indexes (the first half-ish from above) then copy the rest until I reach another '98' and plug it into the blankmodel1.mesh and try to get it into blender. Try to match vertex data with (number of faces in the index) times 32 bytes(vertex pos, norm, and uv data).

Thanks for all the help so far, its been a while since I had fun coding.
