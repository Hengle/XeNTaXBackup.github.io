- Post Title: Arc Rise Fantasia: brcha files

Hello people of XeNTaX!  I am Raijinmaru/Reaver Ind. SFX mods on KC-MM(kittycorp-meowmix), and I'm still a little new to some of the stuff of reverse engineering video games since I can't seem to get anything from certain files like One Piece: Unlimited Adventure.  Yet I'm finally able to acquire models from a game that practically took 3 months of unnecessary headaches and rage quits.  But I did manage to get the Arc Rise Fantasia models ready for injecting them into Smash Bros. Brawl.  

It's literally nothing special for anyone here since people here have gotten everything from the game and possibly know everything that's inside it now.  And that I'm using someones script to extract the models from their .vol files, However; it still feels good to be finally over the headaches.

But one thing that I seem to run into while I extracted the contents from the .vol files, is that I get a number of ".brcha" files with it.  I was hoping I can get some info in exactly what these files might be, I actually hoping that these are the alternate costumes of [insert playable Arc Rise Fantasia character here].  These could be great for alternate suits in Brawl, but I actually don't know where to start with these ".brcha" files.

Any help would be appreciated, and thankyou for letting me take a little of your time in reading my topic.

Looking at my notes it seems that these files are .brres files too. At least they have the same magicbytes in the header "bres". Thats all i can say since I was not fiddling around with the models or 3d data.

I went through the files, and it turns out that they were the animation files for the specific character.  Not what I was really hoping for, but I can use these.

Edit: Yeah, just remembered that there are no 3d models of the costumes in the game, they only affect the character portraits for the menus and skits.
