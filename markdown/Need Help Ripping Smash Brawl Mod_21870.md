- Post Title: Need Help Ripping Smash Brawl Mod

Recently, I have discovered a mod for Super Smash Brothers Brawl, that being the Robo-Lucario model swap mod ([http://forums.kc-mm.com/Gallery/BrawlVi ... ber=210289](http://forums.kc-mm.com/Gallery/BrawlView.php?Number=210289)). I decided that I wanted the model to use in renders and such, so I downloaded the mod, unpacked the files, and opened the model's .pac in BRRES Viewer. This is where the problem comes in. You see, the model loaded in just fine, but the textures were incorrect. This is what it should look like: ([https://m.imgur.com/XkF2JS5](https://m.imgur.com/XkF2JS5)), meanwhile, this is what it looked like in the program: ([https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/ ... nknown.png](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/625655294193827840/687675677809442829/unknown.png)). Could you give me some advice on how to properly port the model and/or its textures to C4D or Blender?

Look here [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbhiZGCAo0Q](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbhiZGCAo0Q) at 3:30 how to do it (but URtuts uses Photoshop).

(He uses a color map, so I'm not sure if this is exactly what you need.)
