- Post Title: [PC] The Elder Scroll:Oblivion .EGM morph format

Hi,all.I'm not sure if I post this topic correct here or 3d model one.Forgive me if i make a mistake.
I'm looking for sulution to inject new face models into oblivion.(more vertices than vanilla)
The current problem is the egm format,it controls face morph data for facial expresstion like speaking,blinking..etc.
Atm,We can only adjust vanilla head mesh's vertices transition by copy and paste via nifskope's blocks operation.
Here is a good tutorial blog :[http://kumakumakokuma.blog38.fc2.com/bl ... .html#more](http://kumakumakokuma.blog38.fc2.com/blog-entry-25.html#more)
but we can't add new vertices.Due to the egm file control the morph data.
I've already read this:
[http://www.tesnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=18566](http://www.tesnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=18566)

It explained the all vertices of head mesh have an index number,and it also provided a short script to use The 010 Hex Editor to modify egm's vertices data.This method only works for small mesh like eyelash or ears,,I wouldn't use hex editor to input 1750 vertices coordinate data one by one,that's crazy.
I know adding a new head mesh means you have to add all new morph data with new facial expression used by the game engine.but we can skip complex ones like speaking first,leave this block for future modification.

Here i provide all information i found.But I am not a programmer sadly.hope ppl enjoy the oblivion can help.
Thank you~:)
