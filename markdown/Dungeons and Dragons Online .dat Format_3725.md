- Post Title: Dungeons and Dragons Online .dat Format

I recently got back into playing DDO, and was wondering if anyone could break the *.dat archive format.  I have reason to believe it uses zlib compression, because the working directory contains zlib1.dll and zlib1T.dll, if that's of any help.  I also uploaded one of the smaller dats for you to check out.

[client_gamelogic.dat](http://rapidshare.com/files/282922827/ddo_client_gamelogic.zip) (in zip format, 85.0 MB when unpacked)

Also, if you need, I can upload the zlib libraries.

Best regards,
