it's a new game

It was released in Spring 2009 for North America and Europe.[2] A console release of the game for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 was released in Japan on October 1, 2009. A US version was also released on February 16, 2010.[1]

If you post sample model files from the ps3 version i will look at it. Need at least 3 model files.  One small, one medium,  and one large.

permission denied is  a problem with your computer writing to your disk.

offzip.exe -1 -a c:\link.bin c:\extracted_Folder 0x0

Still the same. One 563KB file.
zlib Z_DATA_ERROR, the data in the file is not in zip format or uses a different windowBits value (-z). Try to use -z -15
That why i try -z earlier. Try again and it not have anymore Error Permission denied
Have you try on this game chrrox?

Ok I'm bunch of hand with that. I have try in both PS3 and XBox360 and can't got anything with "-1 -a"
Have try -z -15 and it always said Permission Denied (try on PC and Laptop)

Try all   
c:\offzip -1 -a c:\linkdata.bin c: 0x0 (1 file < 600KB) <- a lots zlib Z_DATA_ERROR (PS3 9 valid zip block found) (XBox360 3 valid zip block found) 
c:\offzip -z -15 c:\linkdata.bin c: 0x0 (Permission Denied) <- right?
c:\offzip -z -15 c:\linkdata.bin c:\ 0x0 (No such file or folder) <- of course not this "c:\"

When i can extract DW7 normally   
Is that mean DWSF unlike DW7?

ps3 or 360 files?
it also looks extracted wrong.
the models that convert are extracted correctly.
you did 
offzip.exe -1 -a -z -15 c:\file.bin c:\extract 0
?
i don't have this game so i cant say.
also they might of started using a 2nd compression on top of zlib after 7 i am not sure but most of the files look wrong.
