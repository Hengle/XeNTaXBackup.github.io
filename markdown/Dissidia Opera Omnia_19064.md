- Post Title: Dissidia Opera Omnia

Hello. I've been browsing the forums a lot lately trying to get as much info concerning extracting some of the assets from the iOS/Android game Dissidia Opera Omnia. My end goal is to be able to view and play with the 3d models in 3ds max, or blender. Here is a link of the screens to some of the game files. [https://imgur.com/a/W8o2jhK](https://imgur.com/a/W8o2jhK) 

I was able to get some information from the .g1t files using a texture viewer found in the tools section on this website. However, they were very distorted and I was unable to do anything with that. I wasn't able to get the .swf files to do anything with a .swf viewer, they would always fail to load. It is my assumption that they are the assets which are used in animation and don't hold any 3d model data. I'm also assuming the .g1t.dz files contain the textures and 3d maps for the characters. As far as the second image, the one with the set of files beginning with N10, I would really like to read their data as well. My guess is they contain item information. However, they have no real extension so I don't even know where to begin with them. If this is the wrong place to be posting this, I apologize. With that being said, I plan on consulting you guys until I figure this out. Lastly, I can upload any of the files you guys might need to test things. Thanks.

Sound like the standard Koei Tecmo format : g1t for textures and g1m for models. Try daemon's tool [viewtopic.php?f=16&t=18042](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=18042)

Im gonna give this a try myself. please let me know what you guys find.

I've been trying to rip some of the DFOO models myself by way of nox emulator + ninja ripper but to no success.

==============================

EDIT:

So I gave it a try with the method mentioned in the ffsnt thread. At first I just dragged and dropped the entire APH into the tool, then I started to try the individual files found in the assets folder such as the *.g1t files. unfortunaltely all just result in a brief command prompt window opening then immediately closing.

Am I doing something incorrectly?

YEAH! I found the way!

There are all models I could rip (I just can rip the models that the game download while I are playing it, but I will updating with the new ones).
