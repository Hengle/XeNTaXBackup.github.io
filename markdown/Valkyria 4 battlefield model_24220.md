Faqs Of Reheating And Cooking With Microwave

All of us are so familiar with the box called “microwave oven”. Using it is a piece of cake, and we can even operate it with our eyes closed. But guess what? There’s still some concerns and questions that are repeatedly raised on Amazon reviews. The following article focuses on some FAQs when it comes tousing the microwave [Thekinglive.com](https://www.scoop.it/topic/thekinglive) for reheating and cooking:

1.     What should I use to contain my food in a microwave?

In general, you shouldn’t use metal cookware or aluminum foil to contain food, because microwave ovens reflect off these materials. Also, you have to be aware of plastic containers; some can’t stand the heat and will melt. Just use a plastic container with “microwave safe” label. It’s usually safe to use glass and ceramics, but check for the microwave safe label just to be certain.

With cookware that doesn’t have “microwave-safe” statement on it, you have to make sure by testing it first. Place the cookware and a cup of half-full water, turn on the highest level and heat them for one minute. If the utensil is hot, you shouldn’t use it. If it’s warm, you can use it but for reheating only. If it remains the room temperature, it’s possible to use it for cooking as well as reheating.



2.     How to cook food evenly?

It’s recommended to stir, turn, or rotate food frequently. If you are steaming veggies, always cut them into uniform pieces. Secondly, you have to arrange the food. If the food has parts of the same size and shape, lay them in a circle or a square with space between them, so they receive the same amount of heat.

3.     Should I cover food or not?

Yes you should. Because covering food will help to keep the moisture and the heat to be distributed evenly ensuring that the food will be cooked through in all parts. You can use a lid, a microwave-safe plastic wrap, a plate or a piece of paper. Make sure that the plastic cover does not come in direct contact with the food or the heat may cause it to melt.

4.     Do I have to preheat the microwave before reheating food?

No, it’s not necessary to preheat the microwave if you are using it for reheating only. But if you are using a convection cooking setting, you will need to do the “preheat” step. This step is  usually shown on [Reviews considered TheKingLive.com](https://www.instapaper.com/p/thekinglive) 

5.     How to clean the microwave?

You can use a damp cloth to wipe away stains in the microwave. If it has strong smells, cut some slices of lemon, put them in a cup of water, and microwave it on high for a couple of minutes. Then leave it in the microwave for 5 minutes. You will notice that the smell disappears.

6.     How can I test the microwave for leakage?

It’s always best to contact a real repair professional to check it for you. Or else, if you want to do it by yourself, there are some test kits sold in home improvement shops.
