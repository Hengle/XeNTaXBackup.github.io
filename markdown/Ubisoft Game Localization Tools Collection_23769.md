Do you know where is localization data for Wrath of The Druids DLC for Assassin's Creed Valhalla? I've checked DataPC_patch_01.forge but localization files I  found there don't contain this DLC data  or maybe I'm blind

They do, you just have to point to the right folder in the DATA tool. You're probably importing the folder that contains all the table files and whatnot, that's not the one you should pick. You need to choose the folder above that.

Unfortunately It seems that DATA tool by Delutto doesnt work now when you convert data files into Localisation package format. 
Ubisoft changed something in one of the last patches for AC Valhalla. Now there is problem to get new texts from Valhalla. Could be delutto so kind to look at it and eventually update his tool?
