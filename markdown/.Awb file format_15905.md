- Post Title: .Awb file format

I need help to extract/open .awb files. Does anyone know any way how to do that? But except QuickBMS because this program changes original names of files after extracting ( i don't know why). Someone could rip sound files with their original names
Look at this

But sounds that i get....and they are all randomized

Why i ask this? Just when i need certain sound i have to check all sounds out.... It takes a lot of time
I will be grateful for help

Use VGM Toolbox from the wonderful team over at HCS.

[Download VGM Toolbox here](https://sourceforge.net/projects/vgmtoolbox/)

Extract the archive and navigate the following

VGMToolbox > Misc. Tools > Extraction Tools > Common Archives > CRI ACB/AWB Archive Extractor

Tick the box "Prefix file name with Cue ID (.acb only)



So the filenames are stored in the .acb file with the same filename.

e.g.

BGM.awb <-- Audio wave bank
BGM.acb <-- Audio cues (filenames) along with other useful information.

Without the .acb you cannot get cue names from a .awb file as you've seen.



If that doesn't work either, you can get a copy of the CRI Atom Craft middleware and use that to open up the .awb and .acb file and playback each file and rename them one by one.

The .bin files are actually HCA files. Change the extension to .hca 

There should be corrosponding .acb files for each .awb file. If not in the same folder, then somewhere in the files.

v_etc_streamfiles.acb
v_etc_streamfiles.awb

v_main00_streamfiles.acb
v_main00_streamfiles.awb


What tool did you use to unpack the adx2.cpk?

- Post Title: .Awb file format

Hello,

I want to extract an .awb file from a ps vita game.

But when i use vgmtoolbox/common archives/CRI ACB/AWB Archive extractor, it doesn't work. I have this message :

ACB/AWB signature not found at offset 0...scanning for AWB signature: 'bgm_streamfiles.awb'.
File is not an ACB or AWB...skipping: 'bgm_streamfiles.awb'.

Can you help me ?

Thanks !
