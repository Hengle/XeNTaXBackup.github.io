I found this tutorial : 
,,Tutorial for 3Ds Max:
for 3DS Max
1. run 3Dexplorer
2. open the .ase file into 3Dexplorer
3. save as .wrl file
-open in 3DS Max
1. file>open
2. save as .3ds file "

But when i import the car in to 3dexporer it looks like this [http://img526.imageshack.us/img526/2181/ussx.jpg](http://img526.imageshack.us/img526/2181/ussx.jpg) , and i cant export it as .wrl. Any other idea ?

There are unpackers for NFSU2. i used to have the entire set of cars + addon car parts in LWO format ( lightwave 3d). in fact i still might have them stored on an old cd somewhere.. i will have to see if i can find them one day..

Well a quick google gave me all the info needed to extract cars and textures..

To unpack N4S UG2 cars you need Bin2ASE  and for UG2 textures and vinyls you need Bintex 0.5 
All the files can be downloaded from the main NFS modding sites
The program 3Dexplorer is now known as ( and has been for years ) Deep Exploration V4 V5 V6  Deep Ex V7 is now known as SAP Visual Enterprise. It also happens to be one of the best 3d model and 2d image file converters around. That should get the cars and textures out of the archives. And then converted to a more 3d friendly format.. have fun.

I already had all the cars exported and converted into Lightwave ( LWO) format. so i really just needed to export the textures. now i have bintex 0.5 i can do that.. yay
