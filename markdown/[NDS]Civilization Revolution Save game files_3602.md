- Post Title: [NDS]Civilization Revolution Save game files

I've got trouble figuring out the complete format of the Nintendo DS savegame files. There seems to be some kind of compression or CRC going on. Parts start with 90 XX and then actual values that make sense, but this is not consistent. If I alter those parts that make sense, the game detects corruption, which means the files are checksummed or crc-ed somehow. The files start with a size parameter.  

Somebody dealt with this type of compression/saving before?
