Fable2 BNK Archive Extractor
This extractor will not get you any generally usable files.  The all internal files in the BNK archives we have seen so far are custom Fable2 formats.  However, this is a key step to getting started on cracking the formats of these internal files.
This is strictly a command line tool for the time being.

LUAplus Compiler/Decompiler
It compiles and decompiles LUA files from Fable 2.

BNK Extractor (GUI)
A bit late for this one, but here is a GUI version of Hunter's BNK extractor.
There are only real two options when you open the file at the moment.
You can dump the entire .bnk file. In this option you select the dump folder and within the dump folder it creates a full file path within the folder. You can also right-click and extract a file by hand using the context menu option within the treeview.

BNK Extract/Lister/Mix
BNK Extraction utility, which extracts files from BNK Archives, a BNK File Listing utility, which stores the list of files in a BNK archive in a text file, including size per file in bytes and whether the archive is compressed or not, and a BNK File Mixing utility, which extracts and mixes two similar archives' files, to be used mostly with *_headers.bnk / *.bnk
