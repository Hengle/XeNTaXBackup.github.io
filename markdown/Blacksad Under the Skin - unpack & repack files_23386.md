- Post Title: Blacksad Under the Skin - unpack & repack files

Hello friends.

I hope you are well wherever you are.

I want to translate Play Blacksad Under the Skin Game into my own language.

And when I looked at the file format of this game, I was very surprised because I have never worked with this type of format.

I wanted to say that if you know anything about these formats, help me.
How to extract the game text and also the game font.

Your friend: Aria.

This looks like standard Unity game. 
There are tools for that like UnityEx, Asset Studio or Unity Asset Explorer.

Hello friends, I hope you are well.

I wanted to say that I am working on a game called Play Blacksad Under the Skin. And I want to extract the text and font of this game and translate it into my own language. Add a font to the game in my own language.

I used the following software and was able to extract the game font, but I do not know how to add the font I want to the game because the software does not have the option to add.
Software: AssetStudio and UnityAssetsExplorer
That the photo I put here shows you everything.

Thanks for helping me how to add my desired font to this game with this software or any other software.

I have merged your topics. Plese don't duplicate topics ever again.

As for your question, UnityEx has reimport function. Does it not work for you?

Sorry I uploaded my post again.
Because I did not see the topic in the list, I thought it was deleted, so I uploaded it again.
I'm ashamed anyway.

By software, I do not mean that it does not work, I mean that there is no such thing as importing.

Thank you very much. You are a very good Moderator.
And I'm ashamed to ask you so much, I hope you do not get upset that I ask you so much.

This photo you sent from this software, I do not have this software.
Can you send me the download link of this software?

Yeah, sure, but you could just... google it, you know? When you type "UnityEx download" in google, you'll get some results.

Anyway, here are some links:

Hello how are you?

I wanted to say that I was able to extract a few files from the files of this game, which I guess are subtitle files of the game.

But when I open them, why are they like this?

It doesn't really look like a text file. Keep searching.

Hello, the language file of the game is attached.

[https://www.sendspace.com/file/sefssz](https://www.sendspace.com/file/sefssz)

There's character limitation in the game. That makes it very difficult to translate. I'm uploading a picture of the game's language file here. 
Can any tool be made? Or is there any way to package it without character limitation?

Hello, I want to translate the game into Turkish. I also understand unity files, but there are character limitation in this game. I mean, it takes a lot of work to turn this game without writing a tool.

What you can do is reduce the font size!
That's how I do it when I need space!
