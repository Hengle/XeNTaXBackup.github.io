- Post Title: Rocket League - upk and Coalesced_INT.bin Decryption

Hi everyone,

I was just wondering if anyone has managed to figure out a way to decrypt the .upk and Coalesced_INT.bin files for Rocket League.

I love this game and was interested in poking around 'behind the scenes' further. Any help/guidance would be appreciated as I am quite new to this.

Thanks
