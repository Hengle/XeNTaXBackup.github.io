if you look lng file you will see that in the beginning of file that:
20(space) is 01 in the rest of file.
e is 02, t is 03, o is 04 so on... you should need a program that converts this chracters to text and then it should do reverse process also.
for example,   after that:"voices\l09_dead_city_1\burbon_15",  if you convert properly, that should write:

```
S   o   m  e   (space)    p   e  o    p  l    e
```
