Hello friends. I only recently discovered that Ninja Ripper 2.0.x has a function to generate matrix coordinates to correctly position ripped models and parts in Blender. I was ripping Mercenaries 2: World in Flames using Ninja Ripper 2.0.5, however when I checked the Log file, I couldn't find the matrix projection coordinates anywhere by searching "proj", "matrix", "float" " and among other words. Does anyone know what other names can contain the coordinates in the Log? Mercenaries 2, interestingly, was only started by NJ 2.0.5 using DG Voodoo in the game directory, as using just NJ with or without the wrappers files it never starts. Also, ripping can only be done with the Forced Rip function.

If this is resolved, perhaps a definitive way to extract models from Mercenaries will finally be found, as until today no one has made a .Block file viewer or file extractor of any kind. I also thought if some modding tool made for games on the same engine (Zero engine) like, for example, Battlezone 2, could be used to do the extraction. The game has very interesting models. Interesting and fun modeling and texturing, especially in regards to tanks and helicopters.
