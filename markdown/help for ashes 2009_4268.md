At least the async.big.w32 looks like a zip file. You should be able to extract it with the usual tools.
The info-async.big.w32 contains some fileinfos and is readable like a txt file. From the informations in the info-async.big.w32 I would guess that the other files are just cut offs of the mainfile.

in my opinion you deserve no help at all because you are not respecting the others with your continuous and annoying bumping of the thread and saying that this forum is useless which is ridiculous when said by someone who has only 7 posts that are all in this thread... and are all requests.

anyway I did the job for my personal challenge and for anyone else interested in it:

sorry really sorry for my behavior  

anyway what you did extracted around 1139 files out of maybe a 20,000 files thanks maybe it is because i only gave a small part of the file if i could give you  the full file then could you extract it fully  thanks for your efforts 

also currenty there is [importer extracter here](http://www.planetcricket.net/forums/ashes-cricket-2009-downloads-forum/ac09-big-editor-v0-1-beta-62002.html) but the .model archives  are not accessible  this is made by abhinav of planetcricket  

also i have attached a model archive of  a players face can you extract the textures inside it please most probably texture will be dds format also if you are able to extract then try to import into the archive as well please

uhmmm from my point of view the script is correct, indeed it works perfectly on the demo and if your archive is under 4gb it must work with it too.

then does QuickBMS report an error or not?

i think i gave a cut of demo anyway 

it gives this error
 "Error:the compressed zlib/deflate input is wrong or incomplete (-3)

  Error : there is an error with the decompression
           the returned output size is negative (-1) "

anyway in demo also it exracted only 1136 files whereas using the big editor we can  see 7000 files in demo and 17,000 in real game 

anyway because there is already a editor for whole big file if you could extract textures and models from the .model archive and other things i mention afterwardsmy and other gamers who want to mod this game  purpose will be solved also there are ome other files in the big archive that currently we cannot edit  here is a list [i have rared one of each types in package.rar which you can download here](http://www.ziddu.com/download/9590820/Package.rar.html)

@ .dwa files (it doesn't open with Dogwaffle)(contains some graphical stuff as title screen etc)
@ .db files (contain game-play aspects and the names of players)(will be magical if you could crack it)
@ .model( i gave you that file before) (but now i have put th bigger model archive of  a stadium)

also even if you manage to extract it we have to also find a way to import it to make any use of it 

also when i try to run file cutter 1.1 by mr mouse it gives error
"runtime error '339':

 Component ' VBZip_control.ocx ' or one of its dependencies not correctly registered: a file is missing"

so could you give me some other file cutter which works with vista so i can post a cut of the whole 2 gb file i think i may have taken cut of demo  

THANKS Once Again for your support

here with the demo I can extract all the over 7000 files so absolutely no problem here.
I have updated the bms script to version 0.1.1 for that zlib problem so redownload it

about the zlib problem: in short while I was creating the script I knew that I needed to extract the chunks with a size of 0 as blocks of 65536 bytes without unzipping them, but I forgot it during the release. that's what I have fixed

this is an extractor, editing the content is totally unrelated to my job
same for the "repacking", I work only on extractors.

while for the 2gb file it's not needed because I fixed the bug

then any of your friends can edit or repack because without that it is not useful to extract
