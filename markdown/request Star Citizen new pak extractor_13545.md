Hey, was hoping anyone is able to help with a new/updated pak extractor for the latest Star Citizen version.
don't know whats changed in the last few SC updates in regards to encryption/compression, but extracting meshes for 3d programmes via cryengine doesn't work any more with the current pak extractor

SC pak encrypter/decrypter tools from the leaked files in case it helps: [https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B2Y0RI ... sp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B2Y0RIUBqF2wVHFUelpFU3ROLUk/view?usp=sharing)

also did some looking around through the SC launcher with a hex editor looking for a key, best i could come up with is : 30818902818100D37207BFACA6E407AD486C28FA193B89FDE8756B01340A35B3A8C7F33FFCD3
