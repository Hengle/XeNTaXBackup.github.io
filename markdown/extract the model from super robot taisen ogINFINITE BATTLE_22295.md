This game on PS3 has two files at the beginning, one is PS3_ stream.cpk , one is PS3_ game_ cpk.sdat Where is the model file? How should I extract it?

This is my first time to extract the game model

After extracting from CPK file, I found no model file

The model file may be in PS3_ game_ cpk.sdat So how should I extract the SDAT file?

Hello,I have now successfully extracted the model files from SDAT, but these files are in the form of bin.so i want to know if there is a BMS script or a tool to convert the .bin models to .obj?
And if there is not, could it be possible to make a BMS script at least?.

(Static?) meshes are not a big deal in case you're somewhat familiar with half floats. Using hex2obj (view link in my sig):

This is my script so far, if you want to test it out.  Not sure if it's perfect, but hopefully it should work with most models.

Download Noesis, put my script in the plugins/python folder and the _model.bin files should then load.
