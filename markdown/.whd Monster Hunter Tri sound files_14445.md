I'm trying to convert a sound file (.whd format) from Monster Hunter Tri to the .wav format, I've looked around and there's nothing very useful. Here's a sample file: [https://www.dropbox.com/s/u8sdeidcw2zdm ... 0.whd?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/u8sdeidcw2zdm82/axe000.whd?dl=0)

I did find this thread, however: [http://hcs64.com/mboard/forum.php?showthread=20528](http://hcs64.com/mboard/forum.php?showthread=20528)
