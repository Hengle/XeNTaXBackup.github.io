Hey Mr.Mouse, I've recently been having a problem with the New Post flags taking me to a blank page, instead of the new post(s) in the thread. This is getting to be a big annoyance. Do you think you could take the time at some point to look into this? Thank you!

Seems to be fine for me, though I didnt use the forum for most of th day so maybe the Problem was fixed.

It's been happening for more than a day for me (a couple of weeks, IIRC). And I can vouch that it has nothing to do with the computer I'm on (it happens on two different computers) or the browser I'm using (happens with both IE and FF). If anyone else experiences this problem, post here...

I'm getting it too. Very weird because we didn't change anything (or did we Mr. Mouse?).

I'll try to look into it.

Ok. I'll update the forums software tonight (9 hrs from now). It will be offline for a while.

As a side note, I'm looking into other free forums software, as phpbb is just too leaky and too much unnecessary work. If anyone knows good free forums software, with a design that actually lets you extend it in a sensible way, let me know.

Ok that took longer than expected...

I got the stuff working and installed the attachment mod (why does that cost 45 minutes of manually editing files?). The other hacks will have to wait because it's bed time for Captain
