- Post Title: Translating the Telltale Sam and Max Games

I'm thinking of translating all 3 seasons to Brazillian Portuguese since I've only seen the first episode of Season 1 being translated. I'm only a beginner and I don't know where to start. How can I modify the subtitles of the games?

Also I tried every guide ever but they only reference other Telltale games.
