- Post Title: Naruto Storm Model Rigging Blender Export Script

I'm part of the Naruto Shippuden Ultimate Ninja Storm modding community, and we've discovered how to export a models bone rigging to blender. Unfortunately, we need some assistance with writing a script to automate this and reimporting the rigged bones back to the original model file. Would anyone here be interested in assisting us please? We currently use the tool linked below to rig in unity, but blender rigging would allow for this process to be done much faster.

Do u think anyone will help you downloading a game ( whose name is unknow btw) and find her/himself models? 

To make the request valid , in order to male a blender script , you should give some models /skeleton samples.
 ( I m not the one that will take a look on them , mine is just an advice for improving your post).
