- Post Title: Tension Graphics AB - Just a random code

By pure coincidence I stumbled upon random code, that I found.
It's a source code for CCharacter class, written in C++.
The main prefix seems to be TG. (Engine initials?)
It looks like some dev made a rookie mistake and posted something he shouldn't to public (share between devs, etc...).
It looks like it's only a prototype, but well written.
Model format file extension is tfm.
Animation format file extension is tfa.
It seems to be developed only for PC and PS4, by the macro definitions.
It's a shooter game, tho not sure if FPS or TPS.
There are 4 characters: Laguna. Joe(Cateye), Cupcake and Zuki.
The engine uses Havok library for physics.

If any of those words I wrote sounds familiar, feel free to post.

Game-play sounds like a contra game.
There are a few more files from it on pastebin

Tanks for a heads up.

There is also this file: [https://pastebin.com/VKpP7HCQ](https://pastebin.com/VKpP7HCQ)

The company name is Tension Graphics AB, they are a Swedish company, that just do some stuff (mostly commercial).
Hence the TG prefix on some filenames.

I wanted only some info about Havok hknp classes, which I got.
These files just popped up in search engine.
