I have an importer on my site, but it requires you use my xex hack to load the paint tool up.  The checksum routine still hasn't been reversed yet, but I was able to bypass the checksum check when loading, and then you let the game save it with the correct checksums.  If you don't have a way to run a modified xex file, then you can upload the PT File you make with my tool on my forums, and then someone will hopefully convert it for you.  If you have a PS3, you can't do it, I don't make hacks for that.
