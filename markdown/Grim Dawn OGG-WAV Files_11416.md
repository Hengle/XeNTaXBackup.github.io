- Post Title: Grim Dawn OGG-WAV Files

This game is in Alpha Access, and it appears to be good. I tried to extract the files from the archives with ARCextractor (the same used for titan quest, since the engine should be the same).
however, OGG and WAV files refuse to be played or recognized. I tried asking in the official forums, but nothing has been known yet. while official tools are supposed to be released later, I'd like to know a bit more.

anyone knows the game?

Sorry to bump your older topic, if you are looking to extract the game data, you can check out my projects grimarc and grimarz here:
viewtopic.php?f=10&t=12037
viewtopic.php?f=10&t=12041

These will extract the game data of the current game version (Build 21 as of this post) and you should be able to fully listen to any and all of the .wav and .ogg files. (As well as see the other game data and such.)

why should I be upset? thanks!
