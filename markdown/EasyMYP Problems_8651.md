Well i tried to extract SWTOR files myself but it doesn't work. While the Debug version works, it can't extract files and the files are not named properly.

Can you elaborate a bit more? What are you trying to do with what, and then what happens if you do.

As I wrote [here](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?p=70136#p70136), I recommend looking at my tutorial for EasyMYP.
It looks like you are missing the file names list.

Also, EasyMYP crashes when trying to export individual files, so you'll have to extract the whole archive.
