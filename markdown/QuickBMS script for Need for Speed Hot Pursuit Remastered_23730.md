- Post Title: QuickBMS script for Need for Speed Hot Pursuit Remastered

Hello! I am new to modding and I would like to extract files from my game in order to read and modify them. I’ve been searching and found that quickbms can be used to do just that.

However there is not quickbms script for that game and I have no idea on how to make one   
I searched and found a tutorial for it but I dont understand how people recognize what means which byte in the header in a hex editor.

If any of you nice souls can help me I’d be very thankful!

Why do you need a quickbms script? There is already a thread here for extracting cars from the game and repacking with Noesis:
