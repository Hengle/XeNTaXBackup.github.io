Not too certain myself if it IS indeed a loyal triqual or just a sci-fi war strat with the RA name. Hopefully it is... that first thing, not the second.  I own pretty much everything C&C XD, other than Unreal C&C was one of my first, if not THE first, modding experience I had which becomes more open ended... if not a bit more complex... in each installment. Needless to say I'm a fan, but a harsh one. XD

I love all the Command & Conquer Games... A little too much to think of it. (Ask Zench, He'll probably tell you I'm addicted to it.) Anyways the RA3 Mod SDK is out, which is good news for this modding forums.

I really like the C&C games as well.  Although, as strat games go, I think my all time favor game was Total Annihilation.

Well, as far as RTS games go, I'd have to mention StarCraft, WarCraft 2, C&C+Red Alert and Age of Empires. More or less in that order. AoE2 was still a favourite though. Total Annihilation was good also, but I never got hooked to it for some unknown reason (Perhaps it was the futility of the storyline). 

I therefore eagerly await StarCraft 2. 

Oh and a worthy mention should be Ground Control. Now that was awesome: RTS in Real Time 3D! I remember laying low in a crater with some soldiers, when I looked up I saw enemy aircrafts high up there patrolling, that was a fabulous real experience. 

Come to mention 3d RTS: what about Homeworld 1 and 2? Pretty fucking fabulous also!!
