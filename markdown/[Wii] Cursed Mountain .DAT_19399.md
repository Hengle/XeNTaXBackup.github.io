- Post Title: [Wii] Cursed Mountain .DAT

Aluig or anyone who understands, could you tell me if this script is actually working? I'm having trouble editing the Wii version, it apparently extracts everything correctly, but it does not matter to perfection, even though it does not change anything, the file gets much bigger than the original and the game stops working.
