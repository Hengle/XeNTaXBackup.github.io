Game model examples


One of the most articulated and fully textured models I've seen with proper joints and everything.
These are unpacked from the BATTLE.AFS\($001$).AFS file, and the .ppk files were bms extracted, script file made by aluigi.
TXD files were unpacked to TGA via PS2TXDViewer
and finally the DFF importer script for 3DSMAX by The Hero at GTAForums

The only problems I'm encountering so far is renaming the mesh objects, and finding the bones since I am still unused to 3DSMAX.
If anyone wants to help renaming stuff
Here are the links for most of the available plugins

What version of 3ds Max are you using?
I have tried 64 bit 2013 and 2018 along with 32 and 64 bit 2010, all crashed on import.

Edit
Nevermind, after trial and error I found that the import option "Import as Standard Materials" needs to be ticked
