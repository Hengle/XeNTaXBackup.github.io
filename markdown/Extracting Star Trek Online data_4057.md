- Post Title: Extracting Star Trek Online data

Heya,

I'm trying to extract game data from Star Trek Online.  I already unpacked the .hoggs files thanks to [this thread](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=4020&start=0&st=0&sk=t&sd=a).  But now I'm not sure where to head to next.  I'm trying to extract the item database and zone maps.  

There are lots of .bin files, but I'm not sure how to open them.  I'm tried searching around for an answer, but couldn't find anything specific to this.  I tried using Game Extractor, but wasn't really sure of what it was telling me.  Most the files came up as unable to extract.  

If someone else has been playing around with this or Champions Online, I'd really appreciate and help you could give me.

Thanks!

.bin files are a general serialization format that Cryptic has developed. Think of them as a compiled form of source data (such as Excel tables, XML data, etc). Generally, there is a unique structure definition for every one of those files. I bid you good luck in working out their formats.
