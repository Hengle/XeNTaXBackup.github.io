- Post Title: Convert a .obj to a .gr2 (SWTOR)

Hello there beautiful peeps!   

I'd like to know something... is there a program that can convert an obj model to a gr2 model? 
I'm ultimately trying to replace a model within a .tor directory using my super awsome .tor file changer but all models seem to be represented as a .gr2 file type and it seems I need to change a .obj file to a .gr2! I read somewhere that there was an SDK for this somewhere but it apparently costs thousands of $$$?

Any help with this is appreciated!
