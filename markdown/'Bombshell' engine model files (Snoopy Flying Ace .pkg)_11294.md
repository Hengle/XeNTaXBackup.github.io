- Post Title: 'Bombshell' engine model files (Snoopy Flying Ace ".pkg")

Well I've done a lot of searching with no such luck on finding any type of help with this. Though looking at it through Hex Editors and such, it would seem a fairly simple enough format. I was hoping we could find a way to extract models and maybe textures of these files for easy viewing? Console is Xbox 360. Game in question is Snoopy: Flying Ace, and the format is one of the ever common 'pkg' files.
