Hey there,

I am working on Def Jam Fight For New York to edit some files...
No i have been looking for 3 days for a .VIV and .BIG unpacker.
Dragon Unpacker can unpack VIV but at BIG it crashes... I thought i was so close  I feel like i am failing.
Then I foung Game Extractor which can also unpack VIV but fails at BIG... 
Last one was XENTAX..... I Opened VIV and i saw it did support Def Jam and I smiled, when I tried to open 1 BIG file i got 2 errors ( Look at the attachment).
I was like : Why does it have to go wrong... I really want to get this somewhere, Also the program says you can modify .BIG files from Def Jam FFNY.

Im doing this because im tired of the same music in the game... And I wanna modify some cloth and some stuffs.. i did it with an naruto game and it went raelly good but it did not contain .big files or .o files... so yeh

Please can anyone help me?? He could also join me.. if he wants to

Thank you in advance

The ssh contains 8-bit images of 512 x 92 (some) followed each by a palette (0x400 in size, BMP style).

Look the format of the files is as follows:

```

[4]		Magic word "SHPS"
uint32		Archive size (total size of .ssh file)
uint32		Number of resources
[4]		Filename (first part)

// Resource entry (repeated 'number of resources' times)

[4]		Filename (second part)
utin32		Offset of resource data

// Resource data (each resource actually begins with 'Buy ERTS' followed by 16 zero bytes, but the offset pointers above skip this part)

[1]		Unknown, always 2
uint24		Size of the graphics bitmap part (24-bit value!) INCLUDING the 16-byte header
uint16		Width
uint16		Height
[n]		BITMAP (8-bit bitmap, of 256 colours)

[1]		Unknown, always 0x21
uint32		Size of colour table INCLUDING the 16-byte header
[11]		Unknown, always the same, possibly one value is also the number of colours (256)
[n]		Palette (RGBA format, where A is often 0x80) 
[16]		Another row of values 
[240]		"EAGL240 metal bin attachment for runtime texture management" followed by zero bytes
[32]		tail values

```

This is a BMS that will extract the raw bitmap data of each SHP and it's palette. You can use also the .bms file below in MultiEx Commander.

.ssh .bitmap .colours (6.03 KiB) Downloaded 19 times



I got a small .bitmap and a 0kb .colours file that i cant seem to open. I couldnt even get stuff with texture finder...
...im after def jams color-palettes.
Any of you guys had success so far?
