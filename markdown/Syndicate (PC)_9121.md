Here is a plugin for noesis to load the xmd meshes with uv's.
whats done
-mesh
-lod load
-uv
whats left
-set up materials for preview in noesis
-bones
-load very very small models as more then just points.

dragon unpacker can extract textures just hex edit the normal maps from dxt1 to 5 to make them work

Oh thanks. I've been doing it via replacing models and ripping them until now. This makes it easier.

EDIT

Curious, will it also work on Riddick? Since I believe it uses the same engine.

EDIT 2 

It seems like quite a few meshes only load a set of verts but don't built the mesh. Mostly static models it seems. Thouh happens with a few models for characters as well. Generally attachments. FOr instance Liquid armour under characters/aspari/aspari_liquid_armour. You're saying it's small models, but from what I can see the size doesn't matter as much. There's something else. Probably staticness. A second idea is, that the models that have issues with loading have emitor points. Though I don't think that's the case.

EDIT 3

Looked at the models in max now. Got one more bug to report. UVW's don't export completely correctly, they tend to show up squashed. A bit vertically and a lot horizontally. Though not all. Just most.

here's a really quick illustration of it. - the model used for it is the tar39 - Left - quick rendition of how it shold be, right similar UVW section on the mesh how it imports

I thought it would be worth the bump to let anyone interested know that this plugin works equally as well with files from The Chronicles of Riddick - Assault on Dark Athena. Everything works the same -- some models work, some don't, but you can get just about anything you would want. The textures can be opened with Dragon Unpacker. 

So thanks again chrrox!

EDIT: It appears I jumped the gun a bit too early. The UVs are pretty bonkers on the models. Would anyone be willing to look at the files in hopes of updating the plugin to get correct UVs?
