- Post Title: TwelveSky 2 Model

I need a mount model file of TwelveSky 2.  I will use this model file in a different game. I need to transfer the model file to 3ds max.


include *.SOBJECT file :



How can I use this file with 3ds max or different program. I mean, I can not open * .dat files.

Omg, how I wish, that every 3d format was like this xD Tip for you, you should look for a skeleton file, it's a separate one, since there are no bones inside those samples

Lol, no - don't upload everything here, I guess. But you will need skeleton, if you want model to be rigged. Well, ready for animation (with bones and weights), otherwise with those files, which you uploaded - you will get a static one xD Weights are inside .dat files, but skeleton noooo

You need just this one model or maxscript to import any 3d from this game? I can send you the model, my script which I made for this game today is very raw, I will need more models and time to make it work for all them.
