- Post Title: UFC Undisputed 3 PAC Files?

Hi, I am very familiar with the PAC files from WWE games but, when it comes to UD3's version of their PAC files, I am lost. I tried opening it using X PACKER, QUICK BMS, and Yuke's PAC Converter and nothing seems to work. Does anybody know how to open the contents of the PAC file? I just need the YOBJ and the texture files.

Most frequent file type. . The PAC file is usually a container for files, although occasionally it contains just data.

The pac files in that game are different to the ones in wwe. The pac you are talking about is a big endian texture archive. None of the tools open them.
