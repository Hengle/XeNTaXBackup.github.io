- Post Title: Force Unleashed II Bnk and Riff Wave

I was attempting to gather sound files from this bnk for TFU2 and found a bunch of riff waves inside but cannot seem to convert any of them properly.
Tried using a good deal of bms scripts from aluigi and alphatwentythree for the format and game, ww2ogg, revorb, and simply trying to convert the wav files to something else. Nothing has worked.
 I am horrible at hex editing and reading the code. Any one able to help with extracting and or converting these?

As stated in my first post. I already tried ww2ogg (most up to date version), with and without the codebooks and does not work.

My mistake. The whole time I was either using it to alone or with the 603 codebooks. Thanks for pointing out that I needed just the plain ones.
