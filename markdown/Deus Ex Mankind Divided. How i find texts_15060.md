- Post Title: Deus Ex: Mankind Divided. How i find texts?

God day! Help me, plz. 

I want to get all text (in English and Russian) from Deus Ex: Mankind Divided. How I can do this?

For example. I opened file Game.layer.1.ru.archive using QuickBMS, because I thought that it contain a game text.  But I founded files *.bil and *.sbs. As far as I know it is engine files, is there?

Somebody unpacked file of this game already? You know, where should I look for? What format is it?

I don't know if you need the texts anymore but I'll write the method below anyway.
I too wanted to find all the in-game text, and with the help of aspadm and his tool(DEMD database v1.1), I did!
Here are the tricks:
1. Download aspadm's powerful tool from [https://yadi.sk/d/qUxdTmJa3MxHEs](https://yadi.sk/d/qUxdTmJa3MxHEs)
2. Follow his instructions in help file to step 3(unpacking archieves)
3. If you want to get the text files, don't build the file tree yet. Insted, close the tool, create a file named "unpack_ext.txt" in app folder(the folder of the tool) ,and then insert "pc_textlist" and "pc_localized-textlist" with each one occupying one line. Save and close the "unpack_ext.txt".
4. Run the tool and build the file tree. Later, all the text files will be listed as a tree on the left, and you have to locate each file in the folder you stored the game archive, opening it with a hex editor to see readable texts.
I found out that most useful texts are located in files ending with"_en.textlist".

What about importing translated texts back?

A way to create a "patch" archive file would make all this actually useful yes....... hex editing a 20GB+ file and creating a xdelta patch is hardly a good way of modding a game......
