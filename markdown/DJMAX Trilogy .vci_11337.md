- Post Title: DJMAX Trilogy: .vci

I found on the assets of a game ".vci" files, they are not supposed to be a big deals since they are not even 3D models or anything that is "complicated" (Or at least is what i guess think so, i'm bad at reversing)

I don't have a real idea of what they are, but i think they are scripts, they are supposed to be displayed on the screen as background to make the game look cool, animations like rotations and stuff.

Also vci's header has VCMF, but i have no clue what VCMF is 

So my question is if someone here could help me reading these files, i hope they are not really a bother for you since the game is not even on 3D, it's a music game and stuff :c

i'll attach here two files  of the main menu "animation" or whatever the files are, and one image that may be related to them

These are all UI elements and not related to the game section i think.


Thanks in advance

PS: the .bik file is just a video file, sorry for making you dl that
