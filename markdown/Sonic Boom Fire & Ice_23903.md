- Post Title: Sonic Boom Fire & Ice

So I'm trying to rip models from Sonic Boom Fire and Ice for the Nintendo 3DS, its by Sanzaru Games and it uses the .san.cooked format (apparently the same as their Sly Cooper Models??). I can't find any bms scripts that export the models with rigging. The textures are also embedded in the .cooked file but when I extract them as .tga they don't work. if someone could make a bms script or something that can extract these models I would be very grateful. (Also Sonic Boom Shattered Crystal uses the same format) Below is all of the character models.

There is a script for 3dmax that can be found [here](https://www.vg-resource.com/thread-29953-post-624230.html#pid624230).
