Hello, how can I remake fonts (menu fonts, ingame fonts are fine) to  support chars from my language. I just need to import/export them from the .bytes file. I can send it here If needed. Thanks!

Import of changed chars works with [https://github.com/nesrak1/UABEA](https://github.com/nesrak1/UABEA)

But importing textures doesn't work.
