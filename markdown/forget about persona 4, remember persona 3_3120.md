No way! I legally own Persona 3 and Persona 3 FES and have wondered for a long time if anybody would do anything like this. Also I never checked until now having the presumption that Persona 3 used the regular DDS method but it doesn't. O_o It uses CVMs which IS just a virtual disc used in some games. The fact they don't even encode it with added software (CRI tools, bane of my existence! CRI encoded CVMs are the devil...) I never would have seen this unless you made a guide for it. Thanks for pointing this out, also maybe I should note that it works with FES too. 

Now I also see how people had modded versions with the remixed (Reincarnation Soundtrack) music. This is good to know, but what I'm interested in is going a bit further with this and stretching into the more graphical department, namely textures and models.

Too bad Devil Summoner Kuzonoha Raidou, Digital Devil Saga 1 & 2, and Shin Megami Tensei Nocturne use the data archive and the indexing file as a split, no tool currently that I'm aware of reads this. But this is a pleasant twist.

That's really cool, I don't think I'd have the patience to sit down and write something like that (but then, look at how much time I spend on Wikipedia, so I must be full of crap...).

All right, I got it, it's pretty funny. If anyone else wants to see, you can ask me to forward it to you so that xrevenge doesn't get pissed off about a bunch of people spamming his email just to see his autoreply message.

well since i had to shut down [darknessincarnate56@hotmail.com](mailto:darknessincarnate56@hotmail.com) because of freakin porn advertising, links to warez sites and
"Mr. Luham has died and has left all of his fortune, USD 3.425.546.734, to you, please send us your:

So you can claim your money" type scams, i have to take extensive measures, the biggest reason i chose operamail is presicely beacause:
a. no one has heard about it so they may not trust it that much/may think its fake/whatever else
b. that handy autoreply feature and the sig which is just as amusing as the autoreply 
c. there is no c (i think)

btw c is a reference to my guide which is full of other references
