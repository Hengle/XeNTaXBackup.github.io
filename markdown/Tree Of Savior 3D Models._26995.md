- Post Title: Tree Of Savior 3D Models.

I saw that a user provided a file to open .xac of tree of savior, but your link is no longer working. I wanted to know if anyone has it and can send it to me.

Another doubt, I would like to know which is the file of the 3D models of ToS, and how I get the animations like walking, attacking, etc.
I did a lot of research but there are several links missing and it's not my native language, please help.
you can add me on discord if you want to help me.
