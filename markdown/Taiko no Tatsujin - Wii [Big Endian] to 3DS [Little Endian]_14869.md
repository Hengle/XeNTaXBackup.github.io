- Post Title: Taiko no Tatsujin - Wii [Big Endian] to 3DS [Little Endian]

I've been looking at various versions of Taiko no Tatsujin note charts and they seem to be mostly the same across games, I can use files from iOS/PSP in 3DS which is great but I would like to also use files from the Wii/Wii U titles but they appear to be Big Endian and was wondering if there was a way to convert them to Little.

I have attached a song with its charting for each difficulty both 3DS and Wii version, from what I can gather when I do a basic 32 Byte Flip the files should end up looking the same, I can confirm songs I have found in PSP Versions that are on the 3DS end up having the same file.

Just need to work out how to go from Big to Little, at least with a song that is in both formats it should be possible to work out converting correctly?

In short, I need a way to convert whats in the Wii folder to look exactly like what is in the 3DS folder... figure if a script can be made to work with this song it would work with any, can provide other songs if needed.

Thanks.
