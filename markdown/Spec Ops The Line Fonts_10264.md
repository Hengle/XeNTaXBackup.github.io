- Post Title: Spec Ops The Line Fonts

Hello I have been trying to translate Spec Ops: The Line. Now all the translation is done but seems like game has a problem with special characters such as "ğ,ş,ı,İ" I'm looking for a way to integrate these special characters to the game, so any help is appreciated.
