- Post Title: Sherlock Holmes: Crimes & Punishments(TFC File)

Hi how are you?

I wanted to say that I am trying to extract Sherlock Holmes: Crimes & Punishments game files. I was able to find software for one of the most important formats, upk, but I also need another software that can convert files to tfc format. Pack and unpack.

Can you help me and introduce me to the software I need?
