Yeah I wouldn't mind checking out TDU DLC or even TDU2 files.  I mod TDU already but would be nice how Xbox 360 DLC works etc, may unlock more secrets about TDU.

I just talked to Djey (Creator of "Djeys Modding Tools") for your sample.

Turns out its the .BNK file of the Audi RS4. He does say when he is not busy, he will make his program read it in the furture.

Tried already.. Its different.     I would upload a sample of it but its 1.92GB and then the 2nd .big file is 2.13GB.


Edit: Found a 10MB .big file from TDU2, ive uploaded that.  So if anyone wants to attempt or manage to get it working.   
Sample

I hope too.

Wanna extract cars from TDU2 and get it moddable in the future.
When model files are extracted I'll take part in researching them.
