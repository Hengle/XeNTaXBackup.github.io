Are there any other files that have similar names? Because, I don't see any info about the stream, so either it's a compressed file or its the raw stream and the data is stored somewhere else. Also can you specify the console?

Sorry for bumping this post back again, just in case anyone needs some information and wants to do further research, the adapted script from aluigi to open the JCA files doesnt work, the cfx files are either wrong ones or just encrypted as he stated in zenhax, though there is some hope, in fact, files might be found in the RAM when opened the game, is as simple as looking for the RIFF....WAVE ^(52 49 46 46 __ __ __ __ 57 41 56 45) format, it has the length both before the file (total length) and between the magic bytes(length of contents).
though this doesnt provide the name of the files(maybe someone with more understanding of how it creates the buffer in the RAM might find out), it actually seems to be a way to get the files, tedious and a bit of snipping here and there.
