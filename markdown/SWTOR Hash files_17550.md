- Post Title: SWTOR Hash files?

Right so I have been trying to rip some models out of swtor recently for a personal shenanigans project and I have need for some swtor models, however the hash files I am using for my EasyMYP seem to be very outdated. Is it possible to ask some one for some current more up to date ones or a link to where i can download them?

All the links I have found to newer hashfiles are always down and no longer available. 
Thank you in advice.
