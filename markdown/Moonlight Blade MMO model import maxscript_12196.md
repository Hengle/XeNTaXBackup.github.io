Hi guys! Here's maxscript to import Moonlight Blade MMO models (3ds max 2009-2012).
It was a request from a xentax user, don't know if I will continue work on model format to get bones+weights for you. But if there will be an interest in this game, I'll definitely will.

P.S. Report bugs

Hair uv seems broken(EDIT:Hair UV works fine)


Some mesh can not be loaded
For example,there is no top shirt and hand

Yup, now I see that there's another model format. For cloth meshes, it's a physX models. I didn't have them in previous samples. That's actually bad, since I don't know will I be able to crack them or not, but I will give a try

As I said, here's script for second mesh type. I should load most models with bones+weights, but I'm still working to finish it, so wait for some bugs  .

Script load 2 meshes,one of them have no UV,another got a wrong-position UV

File:[http://www.mediafire.com/download/mn432 ... /MLBBB.rar](http://www.mediafire.com/download/mn432qul1kp1mf5/MLBBB.rar)

Btw,is it possible to get first mesh type bones+weights?

Sure, it's possible. Just need some time. As for UV's it's solved now, you could flip texture and it will look fine even with old script, but it's not very handy so here's update. About first mesh with no UV's, it's should be that way - it's cloth simulation, so there's sim mesh without UV's

Sweeeeeeeet!

I skin a head mesh by bones,and I want these bones+weights also work on others head.
There are 2 ways I know so far:
Skin Wrap:Because every head meshes got some slightly different,so result isn't good.
Save envelope and load:Require every meshes got same vertices sequence,but problem is every meshes got diffrent vertices sequence

00000000.dat and 0000000a.dat,select same-position vertex
00000000.dat says it was vertex-41,but 0000000a.dat says it was vertex-39
Because of this,Envelope trick won't work,and Morpher won't work either
So is it possible to unify vertices sequence?  
Files:[http://www.mediafire.com/download/kakw7 ... j/Face.rar](http://www.mediafire.com/download/kakw7yiy146n4lj/Face.rar)

Edit:
Just found out that head use bones instead of morpher,so there is no need to "unify vertices sequence" since developers didn't want to unify it at first.

You cannot find the model file you want?
If so,
NEIYI stand for Underwear
TX stand for TianXiang
ZW stand for ZhenWu
_F_ stand for Female
_M_ stand for Male

There is no files name in package.
That's why files name are mess up.

文件压缩包中没有文件名，所以解压出来的文件的文件名都是随机生成的
看不懂你第一句话说的什么
如果你找不到模型，NEIYI代表内衣，TX代表天香，ZW代表真武，_F_代表女性，_M_代表男性
类似的还有很多
还有问题直接PM我吧

zaramot's script can also be used to building .dfont file

Just replace

```
types:"MLB Models (*.dat)|*.dat" \
```

with

```
types:"MLB Models (*.dat;*.dfont)|*.dat;*.dfont" \
```

If I remember right,arms are usually in .dfont files.
In CBT3,neck with clothes.
But in Open Beta,developers redo head models,now neck with head,not with clothes anymore.

but only for player model,NPC's neck still with clothes,guess developers are too lazy

If you are looking for neck in Open Beta,I think you should take a look at these 2 folders.
AVATARS_FACE_X_M_FACE        (Male)
AVATARS_FACE_X_F_FACE         (Female)
Most models don't have neck,but there should be few models have.

Can the skeleton of the model be extracted？？？

Was the script updated or has it been abandoned?

Any info would be useful, so I can either keep or free up over 30gb of HD space

Would it be possible to rip the model from Ring of Elysium? I figured out that it powered by the same engine as moonlight blade, I've try to run the scripts available from this thread and it give me only mesh without uv. Here's sample file along with textures [https://www.sendspace.com/file/zb46xl](https://www.sendspace.com/file/zb46xl)

Guys, best thing in maxscript - is that it's totally open sourced, anyone could see what I did there and alter it in any way. The reason I'm not "finishing" it. Is because I'm not huge fan of oriental games and this one included, I did this basic maxscript along side with my work on Lords of the Fallen, they both used apex, so it was quite interesting back then. Right now I don't have time and strength for this game, format isn't hard but like most of MMOs it has quite a lot of tiny variations, and I guess, might need constant updating:)
