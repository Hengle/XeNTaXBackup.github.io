I will join the topic.
Here is an example forge file and two scripts for (Odyssey and Origins they should be similar)
AC_O_Odyssey_UPD2a (by Zaramot)- for forge files. Gives a bunch of bugs with Valhalla. It needs to be patched.
assassin_creed_raw - for internal raw archive. It seems to have worked fine.

I wrote an export/import tool for Valhalla forge in Python. I'll test it with localization files when the game is playable.
