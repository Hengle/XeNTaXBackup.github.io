Okay I guess no one was interested in this file format so I'll make an attempt at myself   

I must state that I know absolutely nothing about programming or scripting so I'm going to need some help here if anyone is willing.

I read the first tutorial about quickbms scripting by chroxx and was very informative but, looking at this file in a hex editor I'm still not sure where to begin.

For example is this type of file a container file with the model and textures that needs to be extracted with a tool like QuickBMS or is it a type of file that needs to be somehow coverted into a vertex point cloud type of thing   (I've only seen chroxx perform this magic).

And finally, why so many zeros before the file directories begin?
