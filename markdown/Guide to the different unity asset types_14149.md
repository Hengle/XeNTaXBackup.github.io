- Post Title: Guide to the different unity asset types?

I have some Unity asset files which I can open with "Unity assets bundle extractor". Inside are assets with types like "Cubemap", "Font", "GameObject", "Mesh", "Texture2D", "Transform", "MonoScript", "MonoBehavior" etc. Is there a guide somewhere to all the different asset types that Unity supports (i.e. a list of all the types and what they are for?)

I am working with Unity 5.2.4 in case that makes a difference.

There are several programs out there that can read the Unity .assets files but does anyone know of any code (code in any language but Java will do here) or specs for the format? I want to write something myself that can read these unity .assets files and need the specs so I dont have to spend hours reverse engineering one of the many existing tools that reads these files (all of which seem to be written in things that are a pain to reverse engineer like Borland Delphi or Unity)

I have merged your duplicated topic. Please refrain from posting multiple topics on the same file format.
