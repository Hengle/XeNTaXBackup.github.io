Hi, I am looking for anyone that can assist me in finding a Command & Conquer 3 Kanes wrath mod tool for the 360. I really enjoy the game and would like to make it better by modding it. I do not have the knowledge to hex edit or create a mod tool for myself. I have searched everywhere and have yet to find it, I have tried sevensins, gametuts, and various other sites with no luck. 

If anyone would help me I would greatly appreciate it. I am looking for the ability to play with mods online, as well as skirmish and all other game modes. Specifically looking to have it where there are instant building placements, instant units and by instant I mean no wait for having to build structures or units. I am also interested in having unlimited resources.

No, it does not help me, I should've been more specific in my title. I will update it now. Thank you regardless for sharing.
