- Post Title: Dangerous Toys .G compressed image

Hey guys, I posted this before under Graphic file formats but didn't get help.
So i thought  I'd post it here instead as it seems more appropriate. I have some
files which have a .G extension, these are the graphics used in the game, I am
doing a translation for it and would like to know how to re-save them in their original
format, since I've recently discovered a program which converts them into BMP.
I open the converted file in paint and it is shown as a 16 Color bitmap. I remember
reading somewhere that the .G files are compressed bitmaps. Any Ides?

Sample files and the program which can open them:
