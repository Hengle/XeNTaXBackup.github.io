Hi guys,
i've seen this topic about dekaron:
[viewtopic.php?f=16&t=7216](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=7216)

and i've seen in that topic there is a blender import...

My question is:  can i use the blender import also for noesis?

No. Blender import is for blender, noesis plugin is for noesis.

just wondering if we could make some "bridge" addon for blender and the noesis importing scripts, so we could use the noesis python scripts directly from blender.
does this even make sens?

Probably.

I've raised it as a possibility before in the noesis thread, but never got around to actually implementing something.
