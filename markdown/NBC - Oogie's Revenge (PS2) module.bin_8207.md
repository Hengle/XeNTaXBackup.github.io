- Post Title: NBC - Oogie's Revenge (PS2) module.bin

Hi all, I'm interested in compiling a psf2 audio rip for this game, the only obstacle is I'm missing the needed irx modules and they are inside an archive instead of a folder like most games. I'm assuming the modules are in this archive and I can't figure it's structure out. Forgive me, I'm fairly new to this stuff.
