- Post Title: Conker: Live & Reloaded Models Caff Files

Hey Guys! I know this has been asked plenty of times already but ive some new stuff to add to the discussion that might help with actually bypassing the compression.
A guy by the name of MojoBojo did some work with the format back in 2013 and made it possible to extract meshes from BanjoKazooie Nuts & Bolts, I Know debatable quality of gameplay but BK N&B used the same CAFF compression, albiet a newer variant of it. i figure the scripts could be re-tooled to decompress Conker's files. I Know some people have pulled off mesh ripping from Conker L&R See: https://www.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DapU1T6Nsn1c&psig=AFQjCNFE3EtpOSgfeHFwVv5Y6Jrxzg-q9w&ust=1492801900320041

However they never made their tools public sadly the only mesh they released was conker for SFM. 
Anyway combining the research done by a user on here, WRS and MojoBojo i think we should be able to crack the format. Lemme know what you guys think and if anyone would be interested in helpin' out as i am a novice at coding. 

Here are some links to the related files n stuff
