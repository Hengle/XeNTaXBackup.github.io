- Post Title: Port Gone Home models into Gmod?

So im trying to export all models from Gone home into Gmod. The game uses Unity and people have said to me it isn't hard just "time consuming", the problem is that I don't really know which program use to extract all the models and put it into Blender. I know it must be in OBJ or FBX format but as I said, I need a program to extract the files in that format. I tried Unity asset explorer but that program extracts the file the way they are making them useless.
