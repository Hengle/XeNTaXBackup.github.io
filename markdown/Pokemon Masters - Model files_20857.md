Model data is in .lmd file. Geometry looks fairly easy to load. I am sure someone can put together a script for it. Skeleton on the other hand would probably be more troublesome.

Example mesh from the .lmd file

The main models seem to be contained within these encrypted, extension-less files from the downloaded data. Once we can get these things figured out, we should be more set, in terms of getting things ripped.

Here's one of them.

.lmd - Model and skeleton file (confirmed by akderebur) and also a animation file Blender script

Is the script supposed to work with the animations as well? I tried to load a few but always get this error. (I loaded the model first, then the animation file.)

Looks like we are closer to importing .lmd animation files.

The current update adds Elesa's files, but importing her .lmd model file results only her hair and bones being loaded.

I hope someone has the files from the new update.
EDIT: The .lmd file formats from the 1.2.0 update seems to be a little different from the ones used in the older versions.
[Here is a link with the new .lmd model files.](https://anonymousfiles.io/KFm7zQUX/)

EDIT2: See the first post.
