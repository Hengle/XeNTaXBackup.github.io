- Post Title: Colin McRae DiRT *.PSSG archives

I get CMR DiRT. I was interested for game resources. Most data is stored in files PSSG, this may be compiled resources. I researched the file with textures (such DiRT\cars\xsa\livery_04\textures_high\xsa_gr_tex_high_04.pssg), and was able to partially manually extract from it  to the dds texture. 
See in attachment. Also in the archives files models (xsa_highLOD.pssg, etc). They extracted a special script for 3DS Max. I need your help in decoding.
