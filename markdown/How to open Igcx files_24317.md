- Post Title: How to open Igcx files?

I have these files named igcx files in a game called Epic Mickey and they seem to be compressed igc animation files. As I remember they use Maya 2008 extension 2 or some sort of Maya application. Here is an example of one of the files [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1P1_hD3 ... sp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1P1_hD3oFeiGLsaof00Lt9s6USlVJxtqB/view?usp=sharing)

It is either an igc file or a hkx file.

It would be great to open these to view the animations.
