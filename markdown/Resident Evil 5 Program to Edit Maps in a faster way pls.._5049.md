- Post Title: Resident Evil 5 Program to Edit Maps in a faster way pls..

Hello, in the re5 modding community, sectus and wizard, 2 great hex modders, are working on a mod called "NO MERCY STORY MOD", which makes the story mode much harder giving it 3x plus number of enemies it had in the default version.
It requires a lot of time because its all done manually, by copying the enemy definition and paste and edit each name or bits in the hex code ( as example, enemy spawn location which is a 12 bit value).

Maybe some programmer with a Charitable and wonderfull soul want to help us bringing us a program that make us(even the most noobs @ hex) able to edit the map by clicking simple buttons inside the programs interface , like automatizations to add by duplicating the enemy definition and editing it, which has the next info:

Enemy type, location start, location end( in the case it has a "goto" value), health,  carryed weapon, and Enemy model.

if the programmer is interested in making it will be better for you if you read this tutorial which talks about all about manual map edit:
