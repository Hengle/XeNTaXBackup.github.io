- Post Title: Character Model Help please.

Hello everyone,

I am almost finished making some models of the original doom games. I have watched many tutorials from Digital Tutors on how to make game models and what topology is, and ow to make clean topology and what not. My question is:
Is there anyone out there familiar with Doom 3 models and their messy topology? I ask this because the game is 12 years old and the monsters still look good on screen. I want to do the same for my models to cut down on polygon count so I can fit more monsters on the screen while keeping them looking good.

I posted a question like this to polycount forum and people there just don't seem to understand I know what and how to do clean topology, but they are not addressing the doom 3 topology and what is the science behind that.
