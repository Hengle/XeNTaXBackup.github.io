Hi ^^
My friend has a very similar problem with global.res file.
But his file is from game "Rise of Venice".
swuforce, can you take a look on this file and try to create a tool also for this file?

Looks like these res files are zlib compressed. Use offzip to decompress them, then i think you can use the tool.
If the game dont uses the decompressed one, try to use a zlib compressor on it. eg zlibc

Maybe someone can help me.
This time I'm trying to edit Rise of Venice language files.
swuforce you were right after offzip the global.res file the port royale 3 text export\import tool works great.
But i can't get the game to load the modified files.
I left the initial file in the game folder. (en_data.fuk)
Placed the newly edited global.res file into the %gamefolder%\ui\locale\enus folder.
I tried it with non compressed file and i tried to make a valid zlib compressed file but non of them made a change.
Maybe the game didn't work with non compressed files, and i can't make a valid zlib compressed file (i installed zlibc on ubuntu and used gzip, i don't know if i'm done it the right way or not)
Or the game didn't use the unfuked files. If this is the case, then it's a big problem.
Can someone please take a look on it?

Update: I found out that the fuk is only a header and managed to pak the global.res back to the fuk file.
