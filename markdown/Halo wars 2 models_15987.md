I don't know if this works for the retail version of the game but I can say it does for the beta.

After dumping the files with UWPDumper which files do i open with the BMS script?

Also what about textures? EDIT: i noticed they are simply DX10 DDS files just in DDX format.

Edit:Nevermind i was able to load the models just fine a lot of these are really nice quality and it's nice to have their bones and rigging with it.

Here is some textures if someone wants to look at them.

Final EDIT: renaming the textures to dds works and then using MS VS to open them works great.

Hi!

Actually yes, sorry for the late response, i run into a few problems, almost losing all my programs data, etc. But no pain no gain, i was for the model too, another good news include all 3d models i have seen include the bones from the game, still the texture it will take a while to find them, so don't worry about, what models will be include from the game? Just everything this mean: ALL DLC's flood army, all the game, maps, forerunners, flood, scenery, vehicles, weapons, etc. 

I will upload the banished phantom photos and model later this day, (still no texture yet) give me time to find it.

Thanks, appreciated, what's Killercracker script? 

I will give it a try with Halo Wars 1 too, if everything goes well, i will be able to extract everything from the game including DLC's.

I was working on halo wars definitive edition xD

I have no idea how to extract the 3d models but maybe killercracker (a guy in this treadh) can help you, I use the script he made for HWDE

its just amazing bro!!!, guess bois? halo 1 DE is also extractable!!, textures and 3d models, the tools i am using are here in this link with the exception of noesis app, the standard noesis can convert the .ddx files that are the textures, from HW2 and HWDE, here is the link to the tools:

here is the flame cyclops with texture, I appreciate the work of the creators of the scripts, some models seems to have the UVs slightly move at certain degree, it apply for both of the halo wars franchise, and from halo wars DE none of the models include bones, if anyone knows about the process of scripting that want to help us out, tell me, so i can send you samples of the game files.

not yet, the script its for the HW2 Beta(killercracker is the author, thanks!), because of the difficulty of extracting the files from windows apps, there isn't much yet, some models will not work and others will, be patient, i was thinking of uploading the game files for the ones scripting, not today but through the week, i will be uploading parts from the game files.
