- Post Title: Visual Basic 8 - Running program with textbox additions

I figured I'd ask here in a familiar place. I have started my first programming course but this has nothing to do with it to be honest XD though it may help me get more an idea how things work.

The idea here is to make like a simple visual frontend to a console program that would load from the same directory as it. It uses text boxes to assign each file and some additional details for one (minus the "-something" stuff which is done automatically by the button code).

What I am meaning is like:

Shell("Program.exe "-File to be loaded by program by text box-" "-additional file to be loaded-" "-etc-" then the "-something" if present) and if required also would add additional data afterwards.

Along those lines if you know what I mean.

Edit: Ok, I got it fixed, sorry for the silly question, should have been more obvious to me even if this is my first. XD

If you ever need any help with VB.NET 2002/2003/2005 or C#.NET 2003/2005, be sure to post or pm me, I'm sure I can help since I have been working as a .NET programmer professionally since the first beta of VS.NET 2002 

Sincerely,


Nick Kusters.
