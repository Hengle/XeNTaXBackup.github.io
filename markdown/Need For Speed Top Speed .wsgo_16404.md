Hello, excuse me for the unrelated question, but, do you still have the files for need for speed: top speed? If yes, could you please send a download link to me? It would mean a lot to me, thanks in advance.

Found something interesting: a compressor from Wildtangent games. It compresses various image and data files, but the only 3d model files it compresses are .X files. When I tried to use the program to compress a .PNG file, it gave me a .WGP file. When I opened it with notepad and compared it to a .WSGO file, the headers were identical 
Maybe if someone could get NFS top speed working, we could use this program to make mods for it 

Download link the the Wildtangent 3.0 SDK where I found the compressor program can be found online.
I don't think i can post the entirety of NFS Top Speed here, so I'm not going to.
