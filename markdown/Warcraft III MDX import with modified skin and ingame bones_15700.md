- Post Title: Warcraft III MDX import with modified skin and ingame bones?

As I known, there is some way to convert *.mdx, use mdxto3ds tool, blender script to import mdx, or import mdx with Milkshape. But there is no way to get bones while importing Can someone make a script or tool that convert *.mdx + skin modified?
