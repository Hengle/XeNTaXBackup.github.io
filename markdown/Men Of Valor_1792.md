Hi all,

Men of Valor is yet another game that uses some version of utx, uax, ukx, 
and I cannot find no tool for unpacking... 

Any help from the extraction guruz would be more than appreciated 

Here's one .utx file for your convenience.

Thanks, perhaps Watto can help you out. He supports Unreal stuff.
