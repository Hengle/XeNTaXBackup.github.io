Is it possible to ad a captcha to the registration process to try to stop the spam bots registering.

Well, it is on. We will update the site with something else soon. The captcha never worked, I had my own measure in place before we were attacked. Let me see if I can get my own protection in place again.

A phpBB 3 forum I administrate uses [ReCAPTCHA](http://www.google.com/recaptcha); it does a great job of keeping the spambots out while letting humans in (and has the added bonus of helping to digitize old texts).

Okay, stuff in place again. Took me 5 minutes. Now why did I not do that sooner. 

Anyway, just keep alerting us if you see a spammer, but my measure should keep 99% out now.

is it bad we have a subforum with the name "introduction" , "lounge" ... or another appropriate name , so that new members only after gaining 10 post counts become qualified to post in other sections ?

also i believe it has some advantages , for example they can discuss about their skills , experiments ... or become familiar with similar members . 

for example here is a gfx forum that after months i can't complete that 10 post counts and i am still in the trap

That idea did cross my mind, however, as you said, someone can be in the trap for some time, because nonsense posts will be deleted. If will encourage people to post about anything just to get to the 10 posts. Basically, that would lead to more moderating necessary. 

Still, I will need to look into other options to keep this forum going. As it is, we've needed to increase our hosting packagea couple of months back, because of the growing traffic, and the way we grow now, we will need to further increase soon the next months. I'm thinking to put up "Donate" signs at visible spots at the forum, so people are reminded that they can donate to keep the site going. 
An other alternative is to implement the obligation to donate a small amount before a new account is activated. That would probably serve two goals: one: get funding to keep up the free hosting for projects here and two: discourage people who are only going to download stuff to join.

Although there really isn't much in the way to download on my site, from the actual forum, everyone always posts links to external sites, I still recently added that only normal users, meaning you have to have a minimum amount of posts, can actually download anything, and newly registered members and guests, could not download any attachment on the forums.

I have got two spam bots on my forums, just in the last 24 hours, and changed to Re-Captcha, from the simple image verification, hoping it will stop, but I'd like to know what it was you implemented here, so I can see about adding it on my forums too.

ReCAPTCHA is what I use on another forum myself (did I already say that?  ), and since it was installed almost a year ago, we've had pretty much no spam whatsoever.

It is very simple. We ask people for a reason to join in an extra registration field. The account is inactive until we review the reason to join. If not satisfied, we do not activate. If empty, we don't even see the new account as it is not registered.

Ah ok, well I switched to ReCaptcha, I guess it may be better than the simple image one, but I personally hate using ReCaptcha whenever I register somewhere, but if I made it so I actually had to approve every person that registered, that would suck, I get enough email crap as it is.

Hmm... Error message, or just not appearing (or breaking horribly)?

not that I can help much, though, just my horridly overactive curiosity

Not showing. Will need to look into that. I've noticed that phpbb sometimes does not send admins the emails to approve new applications. That sucks. So for now, I leave it at this and please get rid of spammers if you see em. Just delete their posts and ban their asses. 
I will look into the recaptcha issue soon.

I've found the solution to registration problems.  Ever since I changed to the Sortable Captcha plugin, I haven't had any spam bots register.

Thanks for the tip! But why do all these guys always use the prosilver style? Now I have to see what the changes are and how to implement them in Subsilver. Should be doable though.

I use e-tech, and all I had to do, was copy the template for it into the e-tech style.  Instead of being left-right, it's top-bottom, but the way I worded the question, any human should be able to do it.

Also, I added four items on each side, the more items, the more secure.

It looks like it depends on Javascript being enabled... How does it work if a user has JS disabled or is browsing with non-JS software (screen readers, certain mobile browsers, etc.)?

Then they'll have to register with a browser that has JS enabled.  If someone isn't willing to do what is necessary to register, then oh well, at least that's how I feel about it on my forums.

I just wanted to follow up on this, and let you know the progress on my forums.  After installing the Sortables Captcha, it has got rid of 100% of all spam bots registering.  I still had a few human spam registrations, so to get rid of those, I installed an email blacklist that includes all known fake email addresses and also a big list of known spammers from [FSpamlist](http://www.fspamlist.com/index.php).  Just go to the export section, and download a list of the last 1,000 emails with wildcards only, this will get rid of all fake ones registering, then download a list of the last 1,000 emails, not using wildcards, this will take care of a large portion of non-fake emails that human spammers use.  Just copy and paste them into your email block list.  Blocking IPs really does no good, since spammers can fake their IPs easily.  This isn't required, but I also added a Custom Profile Field that is used when registering that asks if they are a Spam Bot, and the default answer is yes, but they have to change it to no.

Ever since I added all these measures, I have not had ONE spammer register, and there is never any inactive accounts awaiting for them to activate their accounts, and any I have noticed, the person activates their account by the time I check again, and actually posts something relevant to the board and are not spammers.  Don't forget to set that they must activate their accounts through their email.

If you need any help on setting it up, let me know, although I know you are a smart man and probably don't need it.  

You will be amazed at how the spam registering will go to zero just by doing these easy steps.

Okay, I will give it a shot. I will have to update the forum to the latest phpBB version first, so I noticed. That means I have to be careful and note the changes I made and re-code them. As that is boring, it could take a while

It's a good excuse to document the changes you've made anyways, in the event they have to be re-applied in the future for some reason (future upgrades), or if someone wants to apply them to other phpBB installations.

Like I said in the Global Website Issues topic, I've installed Sortables.I've noticed that there are now no longer "inactive users" queing up each day. There are still spammers active occasionally, but their registration date was before the installation of Sortables. So, in essence, when we kill those, we should be a big step towards a spamfree forum.
