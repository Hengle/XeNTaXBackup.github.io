I tried your excractor but it's not valid, sorry.
Only works with a smAll pieces of the files .scw.

For example if i use your file cutter with 2mb's it works...but if a put the an original size (80mb's for example) don't work....Nothing to extract!

I tried to cut the file to 20mb's and the same, don't work!! 

Can you fix it?

i Think i can upload the big file (32mb's) but it's too big for a 56 

i'm using the last version of Game extractor.

Thaaaaaanks!

Hmm OK, I will have a look at it for you. I have a copy of this game, so if you can tell me some of the archives that don't work, I will be able to test them and fix if necessary.

I had a look and you were right - some of the larger archives were not working. I fixed the plugin and will put it in the next update.

Thanks mate.
