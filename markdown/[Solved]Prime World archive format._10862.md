- Post Title: [Solved]Prime World archive format.

Hello, I know that this format has been worked on by [Chrrox](http://forum.xentax.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&u=4722), and that he has released a [bms script](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?p=86272) to unpack the_data.pile file, where the models and the textures from the game are stored. However I guess the game was updated, and the file format was slightly changed. In other words the bms script does no longer works. So I have wrote in the original topic, then I have contacted Chrrox via PM, and he advised me to make a new topic, so here it is. I's a humble request for someone armed with the knowledges to help.

I have uploaded the file [_data.pile](https://www.dropbox.com/s/r7lny0cufyl0158/_data.pile) on dropbox, so you don't need to download the full game. Still here's a link to the [homepage of the game](http://en.playpw.com/heroes.html). Also the game was recently released on Steam.

thank you for your time and understanding.

How about that ?



I downloaded latest client version and script work perfect. I guess you use old version QuickBMS. [Latest version](http://aluigi.altervista.org/quickbms.htm) is 0.5.26.
