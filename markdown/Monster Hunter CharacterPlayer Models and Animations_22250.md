- Post Title: Monster Hunter Character/Player Models and Animations

So I have been trying to rip Monster models from MHXX into blender (complete with textures and animations), same goes with weapons/armor from MHFU both have been succesful.

The thing is, I've never found or have gotten to extract the character files or player models, I can't seem to find them in the .arc files of the japanese MHXX (I've only found armor sets named with their respective parts : head.mod body.mod etc.. etc..), but no playermodel files where you put the armor on. They're the last components I need for a little blender project and I'm just stuck here losing solutions to get/find them.

Does anyone know where they're located or what their filenames are? (MHXX/GU's .arc files as much as possible) I really need to know where the models are, I'm pretty sure animations come with them, but if not, no choice but to animate them myself I guess.

If you mean by "Characters" as NPC, they mostly are on the data, mostly always all chunk together in one model data.
But, if they are about playable characters; it follow the rule of every MH game so far (even World) I've seeing since Freedom Unite:

The faces are different models, the hair too.
They is no base body, each armor is the body and that is all what you see.
Felyne works on the same way too, the only it change are the textures.
Hairs will always come on white too, same some pieces of the armor.

Haven't tackle on XX or Generations, because I've not try on the 3DS unpacking process and I'm too lazy for actually search for data that actually are just the same old 32x32 textures.
But, Since I've unpack the data of MH Freedom Unite and 3rd of PSP, they both follow the same structure and after unpack the one of MHW, it is the same process too.

I see, no wonder each armor piece has its own skeleton, from the looks of it I guess I need to assemble each part together as one bone structure/armature (or how I am even gonna do that in the first place, it's my first time using these kind of programs ;^;).

 I've still no clue about the animation files though, and/or how I'm even gonna import them into the assembled bones

MT Framework tools by PredatorCZ, loads both models and animations. It's only for 3DS Max though, and no equivalent has been made for Blender.

Hi, could you tell me how you managed to import the MHXX models into Blender? I want to create a mod, but I don't know how to import the .arc files into Blender. Thank you.
