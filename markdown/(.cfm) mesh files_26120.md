- Post Title: (.cfm) mesh files

Hello! could someone take a look at this samples? I was trying to find a pattern but seems that  I've gotten out of habit from not using hex2obj for a long long time, so any help would be great.   . Happy christmas for everyone.  
(.cfm) meshes
(.csf) armature
(.caf) animations

Well I know it sounds as excuse but honestly I'm reviewing the other files I have been able to extract with hex2obj, and I'm a bit confused, getting ready   . Thanks Shako

Thanks to your files, I found another bug in my SkelFinder (quat transpose didn't work due to incorrect ' inv' >> 'trans' check).
after so many fixes, I can say that this is already the stable version (I think so).

using this you can easily make a plugin. (To be honest, I already did)

How funny that my madness for 3d models has been of some use xD.

That makes a lot of sense, you keep training them every day, and they make the scripts faster and faster.    . Thanks alot Durik!
