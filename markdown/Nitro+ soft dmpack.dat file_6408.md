- Post Title: Nitro+ soft dmpack.dat file

How's everyone getting along?

I need help unpack the Nitro+ soft dmpack.dat file.
The title of the game is 'Kishin Hishou Demonbane'.
Here are the sample cut file of the original dmpack.dat which is around 340mb.

Thanks in advance!

isn't this pak of the same format of the one of the following thread?
[viewtopic.php?f=10&t=6293](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=6293)

and if it's different why don't have you continue that thread which is already opened and about the same game???
