- Post Title: .rsd extension need major help

I've followed all the steps in the Scarface audio support topic 
[viewtopic.php?t=2143&postdays=0&postorder=asc&start=15](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?t=2143&postdays=0&postorder=asc&start=15)

I've managed to decode them to the point of a .rsd extension, but have no idea who to covert those files to a playable format, any format that can be played in windows media player, and uploaded to iTunes to transfer to iPod.



I've tried hard to find anything on .rsd, but I have had no luck.

Anything would help, thank you.

Try to use rsd2ogg utility from [this](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?t=2168) topic. After conversion to Ogg Vorbis format you will be able to playback tracks in any modern player. Also they will have more relevant filenames.
