The only flaw is that it's shareware, and the full version for one license is 50 Dollars/40 Euro.

But, it's very interesting!

I dunno, the site doesn't show the author's name. If there's a free version, let me know and download it.

How does this compare to noesis? I think both do roughly the same thing. I know that noesis is extensible via Python/C, but other than that? How many different formats does noesis support? I guess they both export the models perfectly in at least the two "major" formats (3ds, lwo)? Any other differences (e.g. is this as actively maintained as noesis? etc.)

Noesis is better, I think, because of its various plugins and more functions.
