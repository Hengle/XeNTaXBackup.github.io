I looked into it and noticed that the files can be extracted. That's the good news, the bad news is that these files are compressed by a method unbeknownst to me.

Ok, I was looking for a good FinkelArchive extractor, perhaps this works! Thanks! Now all can use that as well.

The program itself is pretty limmited when it comes to features, I only wrote it to show how the format works. But I guess it's enough if you only want to extract and add files.
