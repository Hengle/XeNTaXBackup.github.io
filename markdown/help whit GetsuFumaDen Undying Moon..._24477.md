I'm trying to extract the 3d models from the game but I can't unzip the files. I used quickbms and unzipped the .pak files but it threw me another 2 .dat file.
Can you please help me to find the solution?

Undying Moon is an UE4 game, so respective scripts and tools should work with it (check umodel for models and [this topic](https://cs.rin.ru/forum/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=100672) for the key).
