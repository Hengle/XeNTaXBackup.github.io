Strangely straight forward. The archive starts off by indexing EVERYTHING in simple text. The numbers in the index indicates the length of each file in bytes. After that the folder and the file name. Interestingly enough... NO compression! 

Provided below is a 2mb cut from the archive giving most of the useful data.

Here's the FS.DIR file that accompanies FS.BIN. It may be relevant.

Would it be possible for a mexcom script to be made or a plugin for handing this?

I was looking into this the other day and found some pictures of stuff that did not make the final game including two character models. I wish I had a way of extracting the models but I am not that skilled.

I don't suppose anyone here has a method for extracting the contents of the fs.bin file? A BMS script maybe?
