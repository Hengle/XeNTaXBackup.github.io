- Post Title: Traveller's Tales PS1 .RAW file format

Hey guys, I'm new to this forum. I thought this would be a great place to ask this question that has stumped me. This file format is included in the following games:

Rascal
A Bug's Life
Buzz Lightyear of Star Command
Toy Story Racer
Muppet Racemania

I've tried to open these files in Infranviewer and I've tried countless numbers of parameters but I get nothing recognizable. It's all just indecipherable pixels. I know that they contain raw pixel data with no header or other information. Is there any other way to decode this?
