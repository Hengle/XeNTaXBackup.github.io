To clarify: if you're asking about ripping 3d models from the actual movie, then no, the movie is just a prerendered video file(s) that gets played back frame-by-frame. However, there may be nonvideo features on the discs (e.g. games) that have their own 3d assets, that could in principle be ripped.
