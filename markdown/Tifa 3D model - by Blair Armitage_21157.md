Hi

The Tifa model that Blair Armitage made is incredible.

it's so cool.

Update:
I have been trying to unpose the character in blender.
It's a little Difficult! Hope to show a result.

Here is a render in Blender,
I am trying to straighten the body and make pose in a resting reset pose.

If you have blender, and want to help straighten the model please private message me.

> Edit: Had to remove marmoset/sketchfab viewer because of people supposedly ripping without permission, at this time I'm not able to give out the model, apologies!

> Edit2: Hey guys, if you ever see any transformative works such as statues/garage kit for sale, or animated content that uses this character model, please note it is done without my permission and is stolen content. I will never make money off this character as the IP belongs to Square Enix. I never distributed this model to any individual or company/website, with the one exception of an animation collab with trusted industry professionals. Thanks!
