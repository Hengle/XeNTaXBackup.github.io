OK its playing a LOT better than I was able to get it, Thanks, but It does skip every now and then any ideas why? whats the offset setting or is it 0 bytes? I have it on 0 bytes and it does skip a little maybe a different number? 
Thank you for the help you provided. now I need to see if the other 2 songs use the same settings.

Thanks again.

EDIT: all 3 songs use the same settings.

Dont know why but the interleaving is definitely correct. 
Start offset is 0 - have you problems with these other 3 tracks too? - maybe its given in this track

Maybe it's the song like its supposed to do that, you know how some people make songs sound glitched like that for example linkin park's song in the end. the glitching in that song is intentional. the other 3 tracks play fine I just need to make them wavs and tag and name them once I find out who sings them. time to head over to trusty google and look up the lyrics.

I have more files I may need help like the VAG files from GTA SA for ps2 I'll post one some time b/c theres a lot of audio that I want from SA than just the radio stations. that SA Radio extraction program on the Tinyted.net site only does the radio stations and nothing else.
