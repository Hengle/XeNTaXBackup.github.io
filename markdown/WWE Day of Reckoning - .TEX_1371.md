I tried it on different computers, and it worked.   

If all fails, try a reinstall of MultiEx Commander and then run the webupdate again.

Yeah reinstalling did it, great job! 
The file extracting works fine, awesome 

Sadly the files dont have any extension, so I have no clue how to open them

Open in HEX the editor a file and look its heading... It can a simple graphic file only without expansion.
