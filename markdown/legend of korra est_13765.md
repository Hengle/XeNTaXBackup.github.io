- Post Title: legend of korra est

hello, it's my first post around this forum. excuse me for sounding noob.

i already found some useful tools to extract content from the game "The Legend of Korra" (TLK). unfortunately i could not find any way to manage .EST file/s. EST files are allocated inside EFF, which can be extracted from DAT. in order to get EST files you just need to open EFF file with your DAT extractor (a BMS script).

.EST files sound/look like animation files. i'm not sure.

kindly, could anyone help me to understand the utility of these EST files?
is there any remote possibility to read/import them anyhow, i ask?

thanks ahead time for your availability and help.
