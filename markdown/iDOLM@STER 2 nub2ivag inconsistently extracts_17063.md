- Post Title: iDOLM@STER 2 nub2/ivag inconsistently extracts

Using VGMToolbox r1013, I've attempted many times using the Advanced Cutter/Offset Finder to rip files from this game. The bgm file works perfectly, but the "tak" file just displays the file name and does nothing. I've attempted to convert the files into ivags but after that, nothing I throw at it does anything. Is it possible to deencrypt, or should I just give up?

Files:[https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B6CE9 ... 1QydDhHNk0](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B6CE9oGhpNe2ZFRKb1QydDhHNk0) (tak, won't extract)
