- Post Title: Raw file requires Script.

Hello to everyone

I will have a wish from you.
This raw file needs to be imported into the 3d environment. 3ds max or blender script can be done. What you can do is a job that you will not regret. download the files , they will understand already.
It must not be too hard.

I'll give you two files.
first full model. the other will be just skeleton and mesh.

İs there anyone who can do this job?
please help me.
I hope someone is so kind to guide me with this.
Thanks in advance

You did not mentioned game, very confusing topic to begin with.
Are they from Assassins Creed Unity (ACU prefix? FR like France?) or Revelations, or some other (I see Altair costume)?
Did you tried to search forum? Im sure there are plenty of tools for Creed games.
What about textures, did you converted them from dds?

I'm really glad that you've been reviewing the files. 
i know your blog, nice job 

Yes, this is the Altair costume.
Actually there are not many vehicles. I know 2 or 3 tools.(ninjaripper included)
I converted the textures from DSS to PNG.
Hope will not cause any problems.

There was someone who could do this work when I searched the Internet.
This is something that can be easily done with MaxScript.
why can not someone else do this?

Ah, TSelman61X. Do you know why I didn't give you model when you contacted me on deviantart? Because you sounds and acting like an obsessed and annoying person. Seriously, it's scares people out! And by my experience it's very, very dangerous to deal with such people. No one want to get mess 10 times per day + it's never ends with just "one model" or just "one script", unfortunately xD

Take care!
