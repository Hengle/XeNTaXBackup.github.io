- Post Title: About The Walking Dead : Conversation texts

hello there


We (me and our team) are closing to localize The Walking Dead game into Arabic language and this is a problem here :

Arabic language is a language which written and read from right to left
in the game conversations there is (an effect of appearing)  that make the texts appear part by part from left to right

can anyone help us to make this effect from right to left or at least make it without any effect 

thank you all
