- Post Title: Gal Gun 2 (Switch) audio format

It is possible to convert .wav sound files to the same audio format which Gal Gun 2 (Switch) used?

[https://github.com/vgmstream/vgmstream/ ... _dsp_std.c](https://github.com/vgmstream/vgmstream/blob/37cc12295c92ec6aa874118fb237bd3821970836/src/meta/ngc_dsp_std.c)

IÂ´m not am programmer but i really want to mod the music in Gal Gun 2 (Switch) but i can not recreate the sound files. I know it is some form of .dsp but that really all i know.

Thanks for the help. I already try to use VGAudio. But the .dsp which it produce has the "wrong" interleave.
