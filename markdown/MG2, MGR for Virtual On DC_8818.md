The file starts with x≈ì (78 9C) and can be decoded with zlib.

```
C:\offzip.exe -a C:\*.MG2  C:\ 0x0
```

MG2 is pvr texture, MGR is unknown model.
Looks similar to xbox360's Virtual On

it's just a compressed zlib file:

```
get EXT extension
string NAME += "_unpacked."
string NAME += EXT
comtype unzip_dynamic
get SIZE asize
clog NAME 0 SIZE SIZE
```
