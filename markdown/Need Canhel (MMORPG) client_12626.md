- Post Title: Need Canhel (MMORPG) client

Hi, 
Has anyone got the Canhel (MMORPG) client ? It's a Korean MMORPG closed years ago. I've got the tool to extract the archives from here :
[viewtopic.php?f=10&t=3360&hilit=Canhel](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=3360&hilit=Canhel) but can't find the client anywhere. 

If anyone has it or point me to from where I can download it, I'll be very grateful.


Regards,
Saurav
