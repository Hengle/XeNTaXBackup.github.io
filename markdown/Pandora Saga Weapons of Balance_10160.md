I found a file named "Sound.Hed" in the Sound directories. But, I have no way to extract the files from it. Someone please help me out here.

If anyone wants to try this one out here is the file: [http://www.speedyshare.com/hkBN6/sound.hed](http://www.speedyshare.com/hkBN6/sound.hed)

Good luck!! xD

This one has some really nice tunes in it.

Unfinished upload(?) being so small or you intentionally cut it? Seemingly compressed file from the looks of it.
