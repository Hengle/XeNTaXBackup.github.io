- Post Title: [REQ] The Last Story .pfs .pk .pkh

Hi,
I want to translate The Last Story to Polish, but I don't know how to open the .pk file where lang files propably are.
Of course I would like to know how to insert my own files to .pk file.
I've found this topic: [viewtopic.php?f=10&t=5938](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=5938) but I don't understand this 

Here's what I would like to do:
1. Decompress the .pk archive
2. Edit some files
3. Recompress it

Is it possible?

@edit for people who don't know what The Last Story is, it's a Wii game
