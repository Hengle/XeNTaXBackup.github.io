- Post Title: Wario Land Shake It! Freshly Picked Tingle's Rosy Rupeeland.

Hello brilliant ones. Lately I've been trying to extract images from these two games but to no avail. I hope someone here will be able to help me with it as it is vital to a project I am working on. Take your time though if need be, I have about a month and a half. The first of which is from Wario Land: Shake It! I believe these files to contain the sprite images and colors to go with them. I have looked into them with a hex editor but all I can gather is something something ".brres". The file extension of these files are ".gfa".

Secondly there is an assortment of files from Tingle's Rosy Rupeeland. The problem here is that I don't know which type of these three files actually contains the graphic data. I've included one of each type in this archive so that they can be looked at. See what can be done I guess.

Please help me out with this. I've been trying to figure them out for a long time now but to no avail. It'd be nice if someone could write a simple little extraction program for both of them. The palettes don't have to be perfect, as long as there are contracsting collors for each value so it may be properly recolored later. I'm not asking for a miracle or anything but I'm sure someone here can help me out. You're great people by the way, helping out people like me out of the kindness of your hearts.
