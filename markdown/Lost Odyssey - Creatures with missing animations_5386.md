- Post Title: Lost Odyssey - Creatures with missing animations

There is a game Lost Odyssey with nice models and Gildor tool that can extract them with bones and animation, but there is a riddle. More then a half of creatures lack of animation files, did someone find where are they placed?

I tried to ask in Gildor's forum page, but this thread has been forgotten, last post was in june, so maybe here i'll find people who know this secret  

Thanks!

Hi Axolotl, I replied to your post in Gildor's forum, but this might be a better place to discuss this:

Basically, I don't think the quickbms script is getting everything out of the .fpd files.  

At least I think so because many of the fpd files are larger then the total size of all the files that are able to be extracted from them using the quickbms script. 

It's just a guess, though. chrrox would be your best source of info there.
