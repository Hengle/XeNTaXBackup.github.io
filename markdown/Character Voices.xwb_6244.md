- Post Title: Character Voices.xwb

I cant extract it correctly with unxwb or xactxtract... it just doesnt show anything... also my computer stopped seeing it as a .xwb and now is showing as a XACT data file ( however when i try to open in other programs it shows me as Character Voices.xwb ) i want to extract this just cuz of the laugh of one character that is funny , any ideas on how i can extract it correctly? sorry for my english xD


EDIT: link [http://www.mediafire.com/?15g79phdoyurpd1](http://www.mediafire.com/?15g79phdoyurpd1) if someone wants/could extract for me... cuz my computer still doesnt recognizes it... -.-

EDIT2: unxwb shows to be extracting but no files appear nor anything O.o

EDIT3: it asks me if i want to overwrite the files... but i dont see them anywhere O.o

you must upload the file or its first 10 megabytes on a file hoster website (megaupload/sendspace and so on)

Hi lapeiro,
the files in your xwb are all in (x)WMA format. If you don't see any files then there's probably a problem with your system settings, because unxwb extracts (x)WMA files as .wma ... unfortunately without a header, so they are not playable (@aluigi: I wrote you an email about this topic last year, but maybe it ended up in your spam folder).
To extract the xwb, try [this old version of xactxtract](http://www.file-upload.net/download-3023539/xactxtract-v0.95.zip.html). With this old version (unfortunately I don't have time to work on the new version), you have to remove blanks from the filename first, i.e. you have to rename "Character Voices.xwb" to Character_Voices.xwb. Look here for a short description of xactxtract.

I guess I know what you mean, this is just the second time that happens a similar thing.
the files are tagged as wma but instead they are xma, it's time to release a new version of unxwb with the work-around.

about the mail, it's strange that I have not seen it or maybe I added it to the TODO and then I forgot it... don't know.
luckily wmas have a fixed header so for me it's a joke to consider them as xma if the header doesn't match :)

I will remember to add a post tomorrow when I will release the new unxwb

new version of unxwb just released, now it even work with the gui (double-click on unxwb.exe) making the extraction job easier:
