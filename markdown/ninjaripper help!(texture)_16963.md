I used ninjaripper1.7.1 to get the model and texture. The model is normal, but the texture is wrong and the color is purple. the display is correct in the 3DMAX.

I don't just want her. She's a test.all model texture have Purple color.I'm wondering why it's shown correctly in 3DMAX.But the correct texture is not extracted.
