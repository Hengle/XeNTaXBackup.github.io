Has anybody figured out the .VOX files for Metal Gear Solid? Whenever I import them into Audacity they just come out as mostly screeching.

Working on it, it'll probably be in Solidus by tomorrow.

I looked at it without usign STUNS or anything other then a HEX and i cudnt make much out of it, but il throw it at STUNS and see what i get out of it, probably nothing i can do much with though rofl.

Grab the new build off the [site](http://metalgear.turfster.be).
It's pretty hack-ish at the moment, but mono files *should* be decoded correctly. Stereo files get decoded to 2 mono wav files, but they still clip occasionally.
Anyway, see what it does if you throw more files at it, and check if for example the pitch is right. Don't really have time to check atm, and I haven't played the first MGS in like, years, so I don't really remember.

I've sent you some bad samples (also Solidus just occasionally crashes on a few).

Are these Vox ADPCM files? If so, what are the parameters?

They're block-split VAG streams without headers.
