- Post Title: Pc Building Simulator - help me to translate it

Hello everyone,

I've been looking for a way to translate this game for a couple of years now. Unfortunately, I never found anything until I came across one of your posts:

[viewtopic.php?f=35&t=24811](https://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=35&t=24811)

The game is developed with Unity and my main problem was finding where the text was located. Now, with this guide I was able to locate it.
The text to be translated is located in the resources.asset file, as I had imagined, and I was also able to locate the asset that contains the text.

However, while I try to extract the files with Asset Studio, when it comes to extracting the MonoBehaviour files (in which the file to be translated is contained) the program gets stuck (first it extracts all the files). It always hangs at the same point....

So I tried another method and that is with AssetBundleExtractor (UABE). I manage to extract the asset, but it returns a .dat file of the asset I need.

Opening it with Notepad++ (or any text editor program), I see all the texts of the translation. But when I edit and the save it  with notepad++ and finally I import the file through UABE, when I launch the game, it crashes. I guess that's because the .dat file should not be edited with an editor, but probably extrapolated itself....

Do you have any idea how to proceed?

(I don't post the resources.asset file because it weighs 4gb)
This is the file .dat

After several attempts I managed to extract the text file and I'm translating the game...

Can you explain how you solved the problem? What program did you open the file with and upload it again? I also want to do a translation.
