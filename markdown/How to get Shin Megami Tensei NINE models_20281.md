- Post Title: How to get Shin Megami Tensei NINE models?

SMT NINE is an original xbox game and the models seem to be inside .bin files and have .dds textures. I want to know how can I convert them to an usable 3D file like .obj or .fbx. Sample files: [https://www.mediafire.com/file/tu4l3ltt ... s.rar/file](https://www.mediafire.com/file/tu4l3ltt7xa9f0i/SMTNINE_samples.rar/file)

Attached are:
- Maxscript for importing models from either the MMX or BIN files containing models
- .TEX extractor. TEX files contain textures used by some models.
- .BIN extractor. BIN files are archives containing mostly MMX (model) files or MOT (animation) files.

- Fixed one off issue in the script causing weights to be assigned incorrectly
- Adjusted naming of nodes and meshes to be more consistent, at the cost of putting each separate model in its own layer.
Keep this in mind when exporting.
