I have a need for the sfx in DMC4SE and they are encrypted in a strange format. If anyone knows how to convert these to ogg or wav, that'd be great. I'm sure the tools exist as this is a capcom game that has other tools assosciated, I just cannot seem to find them. here is a screenshot of an extracted ARC file
