Hello everyone  I can get the 3d models of these files but not the textures, my knowledge of how to extract textures directly from a file is null, so would anyone know how to get these textures?
Note: These files were decompressed with a script found [ here](https://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?t=6964).



Image of model extracted from one of the files untitled.png (46.14 KiB) Viewed 67 times



I also tried to export them with the persianrug tool but without success, the file even opens but emits some error messages and does not export anything.
Sample files - [here](http://www.mediafire.com/file/ct40cl7rd29ui3m/Examples_.dec.zip/file).
Thank in advance for any help.
