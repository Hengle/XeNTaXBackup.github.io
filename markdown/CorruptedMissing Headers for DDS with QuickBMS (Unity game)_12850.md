- Post Title: Corrupted/Missing Headers for DDS with QuickBMS (Unity game)

Ok, well I am trying to extract contents of CustomAssetBundles of an old MMO called FusionFall, for a recreation game im making, and I have all the custom asset bundles, that I extracted with the unity.bms script with quickbms. None of the files are ready to use other than the sound files. I managed to get these corrupt .dds files to work by taking data from them using Notepad ++ and injecting them into blank .dds files. As for all other files, such as terrain data and models etc we are still figuring out. Doing this manual method takes like 10-15 minutes for each picture and is very time consuming, for 1000's of images. I will put an example of them in a .zip file. Please help 

Here is a sample of the CustomAssetBundles if anyone can do anything with them. - [https://www.mediafire.com/?cct8539ch9gcell](https://www.mediafire.com/?cct8539ch9gcell)

Here is a sample of some corrupted images, and then the same images converted, so you can compare - [http://www.mediafire.com/download/zib1o ... Images.zip](http://www.mediafire.com/download/zib1ozj30hmay7h/CorruptedANDConvertedImages.zip)

Here are some random images that you can try to extract - [http://www.mediafire.com/download/lls9s ... Images.zip](http://www.mediafire.com/download/lls9spsp3yy807v/Corrupted_Icon_Images.zip)

Thanks a lot, I hope you guys can help.
