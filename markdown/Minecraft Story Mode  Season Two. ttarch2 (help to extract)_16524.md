I have the same error, but I think we must wait for the new update of the ttarch or telltale extractor because its new already since that is not yet compatible with Minecraft: Story Mode Season 2

put this files in archives folder and click on extract...
and wait... until black creen(command or cmd) show you a massage (extract is done!)
now, go to output_ttarch2... and you see your extracted files... if you put your landb of .font in archives... game can read external file (you dont need to repack)
good luck
