- Post Title: Signsrch

I have just released a new version of Signsrch which is very useful to identify encryption algorithms and other interesting things used in games:

In the new 0.2 version there are some important updates:
- multithreading, if you have a quadcore now signsrch will be 8 times faster (4 cores + hyperthreading)
- CRC engine, it didn't consider a particular field so now it's complete
- bugfixes
