Hello! I have unpacked some files of this game and have found some weird file types, hope a mesh can be obtainable from this samples (without a script   ) because I have tried to get any and the mesh looks very twisted   .Thanks for your time!

samples: [https://www.mediafire.com/file/9revi6ab ... 3D.7z/file](https://www.mediafire.com/file/9revi6abh0wsl37/%25E9%25AD%2594%25E7%2595%258C3D.7z/file)

What is the sense of making other people spending time on such old and low quality game ? 
There are thousands of fantasy game working just fine with AssetStudio , since , as I remember, your is just a general "collecting mania" of fantasy models that would easily be forgotten after you find a new game.

Hello Drawing! so don't think so I really appreciate people's time, that's why I'm not asking for "I need a script", I'm asking for help about values and I know that for experienced people it can be done easily or maybe not  . Regarding about "old games" I think you should know more because you've been at this longer than me, and you know that unity games now recycle a lot of old games and much more if they are fantasy games   . And many of these old games have some unique models. To finish, about "collecting mania" you may be right, but the models are not forgotten I have them well stored and at one point I will have to share all my research.

Priceless.
Old unique models that have been not used in any future game, are priceless

All your treasures would vanish into thin air. So be sure to have copies on a 2nd HD. Or on DVDs. Whatever...
