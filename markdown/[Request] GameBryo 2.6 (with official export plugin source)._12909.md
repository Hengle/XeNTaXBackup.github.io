- Post Title: [Request] GameBryo 2.6 (with official export plugin source).

Hello, I'm releasing a piece of source code of Gamebryo 2.6. I believe that with this code, will help some people with the import plugin.

Before anyone post any messages saying about Noesis3D, yes, I know this tool, but does not work properly. Some models can be read, but the animations don't work.

Another tool is the NifSkope - this tool only works with the version of Gamebryo 2.3.

I'll be very grateful if anyone can collaborate with the community.
