It appears to me that most of the content of these files is compressed in some fashion. Here's what I think the file format is:

```
char {4} - "IMGB"
char {4} - "SODA"
uint32 {4} - Uncompressed data length
uint32 {4} - Compressed data length
byte {Compressed data length} - Compressed data
byte {34} - Unknown
```

In each of the 3 cases, the compressed data length is approximately 70% of the uncompressed length. I don't recognize the compression algorithm used but I don't think it's Deflate. You might try asking the folks in the [Compressed files and methods](http://forum.xentax.com/viewforum.php?f=21) forum for help.
