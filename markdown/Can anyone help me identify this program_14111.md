- Post Title: Can anyone help me identify this program?

Hello, someone on the PvZ Google+ Community uploaded this picture of a program that can extract files from the game. For some reason, he cropped off the program's name. Then there's this other guy in the comments (who I'll dub Dr. Buzzkill) who's all against extracting the files, which probably prompted the OP to not share the program.

Here's the pic


Can anyone help me find this program? Any help will be greatly appreciated, especially by the members of our humble fandom.

Plus I need Rose's sprites as reference.
