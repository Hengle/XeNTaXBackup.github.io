Greetings to all!
Please help me with importing models from the game Splatterhouse 2010 (XBOX 360 version).
Format models ".NIF". Version 2.0.5.0. or 2.0.6.0.
Nifscope does not open this models.
Can someone help import them into 3D Max or Blender?
Applied to the post archive with the three models in two versions: with and without compression.
