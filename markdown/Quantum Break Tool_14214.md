Quantum Break Tool v0.2 beta: [https://www.dropbox.com/s/1lqt5omo20sc2 ... l.zip?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/1lqt5omo20sc2vp/QuantumBreakTool.zip?dl=0) (.Net4.6 required!)

The tool can do:
- unpack every file from bin/rmdp
- repack every file from folder into a new bin/rmdp based on the original (bin/rmdp) files
- repack .txt into text .bin
- TEX to DDS conversion

The tool cannot do, or need to be fix:
- DDS to TEX
- .packmeta/xml updating
- unpack text .bin to txt file (to avoid the steeling of unofficial translations)


If you find bug, let me know. I'll try to fix it.

Thanks for the tool!
I have a question though. When I repack 'ep999-000-en.bin' and replace the original with the new *.bin2 file the game crashes at start, before the intros. Am I doing something wrong or is it not working in the current version?

Thank a lot for the tool Evin !
I was able to extract all the files from the Steam version without much troubles. I used the script by Volfin to read the meshes successfully. So that's great ! 

I have only one trouble with some DDS files however.
While the diffuse and normal (_d and _n) textures seems to be readable without issues, I'm unable to read/convert the "_s" files (which I assume are Specular textures). 

I have tried the Nvidia and Microsoft command line tool without success. Even Compressor crash on them. So any idea ? Could it be possible the TEX to DDS conversion doesn't work properly ? Or is there an adequate tool ot read them ?

[EDIT] Looks like it was a classic user error. Texconv and Visual studio are able to open and convert them fine.
