- Post Title: LoaHF encrypted textures + models

Hello, I just was able to extract the files inside the pak files of the LoaHF game thanks to Ekey tool!.
I was checking the file format of the archives and it seems that every file is encrypted (models, textures, maybe animations too). Maybe someone has come across this type of file before, and can give a hand!. Thanks for read. Im gonna attach some examples.

Good start, but I need more sample files to test it.

The game contains 607 .mesh files.

Based on your sample files I have opened about the 50% of the .mesh files succesfully.
After it I have modified the the loader module and I have opened 601 of 607 .mesh files succesfully.
After it I have modified the the loader module again and I have opened 607 of 607 .mesh files succesfully.

 Could you share the script? or is it embedded in your 3d object converter program?
