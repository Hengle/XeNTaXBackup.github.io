Hello all ,

I would like to know how to convert to wav or any format the following sample :

It'd be more than helpful to maybe make some mention of which game this file is from??   
Also platform specifics (i.e. PC, PS2/3 X360 etc...)

There's some clearly laid-out playback information to be seen in the file's header, but it would be tiresome and/or fruitless to try and speculate the encoding/formatting of this otherwise completely-enigmatic audiofile with out some other ground reference to lend a hand

One thing I can see is that this audio is very-lossy...
Looks like atrac or some-such other tripe

...but still, need some details so as not to take a coarse stab in the dark

Thanks for the reply  

This file comes from an AWB sound file container (BGM_streamfiles.awb) ; it comes from a PS3 game.

That at least narrows it down slightly, but could you also tell me what game it's from?   

Such information can prove to be extremely helpful in solving a riddle... There are a vast array of things I can try in pursuit of parsing this stream into something legible, but all my HDDs (which contain the lifestream of information & utils I would take heed to right now) are inaccessible at the moment, while I repair my PC.

You could be right. At present I'm quietly adamant it's either ac3 or at3+

Thanks for the reply. You're right, sorry, I forgot to mention that the file comes the latest Jojo's Bizarre Adventure (All Star Battle or something that sounds like that). I extracted the AWB file from a CPK container, then I extracted numerous XFBIN and DAT files from the AWB stream file (AFS2).

Does it work in adding RIFF header ?

Bumping topic, in case there's been any development on this. Here's the same file that was uploaded by the OP:

Would really appreciate any help with this!
