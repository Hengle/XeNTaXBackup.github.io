- Post Title: .xma sound files - Perfect Dark Zero (Xbox 360)

Hello, everyone. For a couple days I've been trying to dig though the audio files of one of the most underrated games of all time for the Xbox 360, Perfect Dark Zero, a prequel to the original Perfect Dark for the N64. 

Anyhow, I found that the audio files are .xwb and .xsb, but upon extracted them with EkszBox-ABX v1.5, I get .xma files which I have no clue how to open. After doing some research, I found out that they are open-able in the Cross-platform Audio Creation Tool (XACT). However, I couldn't find this tool anywhere and I really would like to get the music and sound effects from this game. I will upload some samples for download.

Thanks for reading and have a good one!

to decode .xma use xmaencode.exe or towav.exe

These samples are mono channel headerless XMA streams.

You'll need to use [QuickBMS from Aluigi](http://aluigi.altervista.org/quickbms.htm) and [AlphaTwentyThree's XMA Transform Script](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=17&t=9023) to add a proper XMA header.


From the samples you provided, they are definitely mono from the XMA flag identifier near the start of the file (FC 03 80 00) found at 0x06 so you might need to adjust two lines in the script and change it around for other audio files as well as needed.

set FREQ_DEFAULT 48000 # for files without given freq info/headerless files (replace 48000 with one of the following: 22050, 32000, 44100 or 48000)
set CH_DEFAULT 2 # for headerless XMA files (2 for stereo files, 1 for mono files)

Stereo files have the XMA flag identifier (FC 01 C0 01) which can also found at 0x06.


After you have added a proper header, [ToWAV](http://www.ctpax-x.org/?goto=files&show=24) will decode them from XMA to WAV.

Sorry for the very late reply, I left this postponed for a very long while whilst checking out other games.
I get this error message whenever I try to add a .xma file inside...

I forgot to mention that Alpha's script relies on the HCS tool [XMA Parse](https://hcs64.com/files/xma_parse011.zip) so put that inside the same folder as QuickBMS.

I don't understand how to do this. Can you explain me the process in detail, please? How do I convert a .xma file to .wav? From start to finish
