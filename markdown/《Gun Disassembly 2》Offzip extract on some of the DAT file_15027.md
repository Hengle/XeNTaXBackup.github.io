Thank you very much! shakotay2,My friend, but I don't know how to write the 3Dmax script, I'm not good at this, I use your hex2obj tool to open a bomb line model, but other models seem to be open, such as the size of the 1.7M file is not used parameters for each model is not the same? Is there a common way to open? For example, can be directly imported into 3Dmax as a 3Dmax script for other games?

you will always have to modify an existing script.

Wow, it seems to be a very troublesome thing to come out of these files, so what should I do next? Each file is processed separately?
