Is there any trick in text editing? 'Cause when im editing (localizating) the texts, and importing them to the game, something awful happening: some labels are missing and them header codes are displaying...
Is there any character limiting?

[Of course, im using UTF8 without BOM encoding]

The program generating RANDOM errors... Try to localizating ALL menu strings - like me - and you'll learn it: what you translated earlier can non-displaying...
Remember this.
