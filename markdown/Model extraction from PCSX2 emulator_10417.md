- Post Title: Model extraction from PCSX2 emulator

Hey guys,
I'm BACK... with a new computer which should be able to handle PCSX2 emulator. This time, I would like to try ripping models from the Jak and Daxter series, particularly Jak 3 and Jak and Daxter: The Lost Frontier. 

I'd need access to a stereoscopic plugin for PCSX2, could anyone point me to one? I'm told that the steroscopic plugin negates the 2-dimensionality of how the PS2 renders models. There was a thread to this effect a while back, but I thought I'd refresh things a bit, and start a new one, with a focus on the Jak series.
Thanks!

Thanks, Chief... that tutorial looks good, looks like its not quite a precise process yet, though.

Didn't a recent update add a screen dumping function? I seem to recall some of my friends were excited about something like that but I don't know how well it works or anything.
