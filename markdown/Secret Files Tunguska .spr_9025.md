- Post Title: Secret Files: Tunguska .spr

I'm trying to open Tunguska's guts so I can get at its sound effects and other goodies. 

I know of two programs that will unpack .spr files. The only one that's currently available 
to me, [SPRExt](http://oezmen.eu/gameresources/), I have no clue how to use.

I'd like a chance to try [the other one](http://gamefileformats.the-underdogs.info/files/tunguskaexplorer11.zip), but I'm six years too late in my endeavor. 

I'd be mighty obliged if anyone has an alternate download link to tunguskaexplorer11.zip.
