- Post Title: uncompressed and extract textures and sprites from Raw files from Zeptolab games

Hello,

I would like to extract the textures and sprites of this game:

[https://play.google.com/store/apps/deta](https://play.google.com/store/apps/deta) ... ogle & hl = en


But it seems that they are raw files compressed with some of the .pb files.

I tried using QuickBM and Neosis scripts from an old post, but I did not get an answer.

But without success ...

I have a zip file containing sample files, as well as the quickbms and neose log.

Can anyone help me ?

Thank you in advance.
