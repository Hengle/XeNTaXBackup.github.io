- Post Title: NDS *.NSBMD files with multiple models

Every viewer I came across so far has failed to help me, but maybe one of you guys can.

What I'm trying to do is extract models from *.nsbm files. Now most of them I can get fine using MKDS Course editor. My problem lies in some of the *.nsbmd files containing more than one model in them. No program I found has been able to view them.

I've been somewhat successful in trying to split the file apart myself, but it doesn't always work because I don't know enough about the format.

Can someone help me view these or maybe direct me to a program I might have missed?

Here are a couple files to look at for anyone who is interested.
