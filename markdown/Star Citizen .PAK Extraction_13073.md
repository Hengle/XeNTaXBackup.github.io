- Post Title: Star Citizen .PAK Extraction

Hey all. I'm fairly new to this scene and keep seeing people posting keys to decrypt files but don’t know what program to use them with and or if it’s something I need to compile myself and run. I have tried all of the PAK extractors I could find but the file that gets extracted always gets an unrecognized error when I try to extract it. 

I am currently trying to decrypt the latest Star Citizen scripts.pak file. I have provided a link to it below.
