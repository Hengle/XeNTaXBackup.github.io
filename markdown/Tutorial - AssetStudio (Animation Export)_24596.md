- Post Title: Tutorial - AssetStudio (Animation Export)

Once you extract your assets and loaded them up in unity youll see many files. I sort my files so there are only meshes. Do this by the "Filter Type" tab. Make sure you select "Mesh". Here is a body mesh we will do.

Now right click the model and you'll see the option to go to scene hierarchy. Click that.

My file was deselected when i arrived to this screen. Just go to the CAB file where the model is and select the highest checkbox.

Once you got that head back over to the asset screen and "Filter Type" again by "Animation Clip"

I sort mine by the "Container" tab so everything thats for that file will come in order in the bundle. These can be hard to find but track down the name of the file's animation clip.

Highlight all the clips then go to the Export option.

Make sure you select this. It will merge all animation clips into 1 .FBX file

Howdy boss, any ideas on how to compile 2D animations. The game I'm working with (Idle Huntress) does not use meshes and instead uses 2D texture maps, animators, and animation clips. The documentation on the Asset Studio Git is not helpful. Heres the asset zip : [https://mega.nz/file/YO0XRTAY#bUnlxEQfD ... dZGJZqjllo](https://mega.nz/file/YO0XRTAY#bUnlxEQfDlodybEchkyo4lB7-mxd4O1HbdZGJZqjllo)
