Maybe I can help you. Which language?
By the way, if you dowload the cod4 ModTools (~1GB), you can find there the subtitle files.

I'm trying to translate into Turkish.
And I already download that ModTools, and I find the subtitles. I translated some of them.
What now?

Why is this rush? You can't wait at least a day to the answer?!
Tomorrow I'll try to upload the files what you need.
