Good afternoon gentlemen!

The game Outerra Anteworld be based on OpenGL. This fact does not allow even run this game on my computer...
But it has a lot of interesting models.
Textures in open format .dds and have quality 4096Ñ…4096. Model also in open format, but packed in .pkg
Example model Mig-29:
[http://www.mediafire.com/download/3wff0 ... /mig29.rar](http://www.mediafire.com/download/3wff0h9m1s4md5u/mig29.rar)
Is it possible to withdraw the model?
