- Post Title: (PS2/3DS) Tales of the Abyss models

Hey everyone,

I am looking to extract models/textures from the game Tales of the Abyss, specifically the character 'Sync the Tempest'. I've spoken to a few guys on the discord, and was told that the 3DS files have a unknown model format and therefore would need to be reverse engineered (shout out to M1 you legend for obtaining this information).

I'm kind of at a standstill, where I've been trying to acquire these specific models for a project I'm working on with friends and due to their low poly count. Which is why I'm trying to extract them. I've tried to extract them myself on the PS2 version of the game but I found the screen capturing difficult, which is why I'm turning to making this thread and hoping that there is a kind soul who is familiar with model/texture extraction for the PS2 version.

I would be very appreciative if there is someone out there willing to help me.
