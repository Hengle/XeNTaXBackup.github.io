- Post Title: Metal Gear Solid 4 textures

Hello everyone.
Our team want to translate MGS4 and we need some information about graphics.
We know that all textures contains in stageXX.dat files 
 
without any compression of dat-file, but we don't know anything about file format of this textures.
File example: [http://www.gamefront.com/files/20259081/file01.xxx](http://www.gamefront.com/files/20259081/file01.xxx)

Maybe somebody can help us with this question.

p.s. anybody know how to open codec.dat (it's contains subtitles for codec's dialogs)?

Actually, did you manage to extract that directly from stage??.dat?  If so, do you have a tool or script available?  If you do, I may be able to look into the format.  Also, I do know that .txn files are in files like the "resident" files in mgs/stage/init and the "cache" files in mgs/stage/mg_setup, and some of those seem to deal with the loading screen, so translation may depend on those files as well.  However,  your example file has expired, so you'll have to reload it.
