- Post Title: Soldier Front 1 *.LMA *.FXM Models And Animation.

hi everyone,

The .SFF file has been unpacked. Early models and animations are in LMA format. In recent years, it has become FXA format. There has been no way to browse it. . .

I found 3D MAX 8 in the FXA file




I recently played another game from when I was a kid, which is a very old online game.
But I searched this forum and found no model tool that can open it. I feel that it is worth developing a model browsing tool or developing a Noesis script to load it.
I have been playing this game since 2008 and dream of making mods for this game, but my research on the model structure is very shallow, I can ask you here to compile a script or plug-in？


Here are two samples

Can you send me the .sff unpacker to get more .lma sample files?
