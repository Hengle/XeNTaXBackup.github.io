- Post Title: Anyone have Monster Hunter 3 Ultimate or Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate .obj files?

Iâ€™ve been looking for some 3D models from Monster Hunter, specifically Zinogre. Does anyone have a .zip of him with .obj and .mtl as the file types aside from the .png textures? Monsters from MH4U like Gore Magala would nice to have too.
