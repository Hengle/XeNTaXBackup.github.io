Hello all! 

I've extracted the music files from the .HOGG file and got 46 FSB BGM files.
I've tried "Music player EX" and no luck with that at all! LOL ;P I've also tried "FSB Extractor" and it outputs the songs in .OGG but, for some strange reason...it doesn't get recognized by VLC player... Hmm? How odd! =O

If anyone has any leads, please tell me.

Here is a Music file from the bunch: [http://speedy.sh/AVRph/Night-Music-Boss-01.fsb](http://speedy.sh/AVRph/Night-Music-Boss-01.fsb)

Hopefully someone get help me out here. D&D music is too good to miss out on!! xD LOL

fsb extracted oggs are raw ogg data, no one has a tool to repackage them into vorbis chunks from what i've seen.
