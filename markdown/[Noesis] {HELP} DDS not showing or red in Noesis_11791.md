- Post Title: [Noesis] {HELP} DDS not showing or red in Noesis

Hi I am new to this forum but I need help! I have been having some issues when ripping model parts from Microvolts surge. When I load a model the textures do not show up so the model is just white. When I try to open any dds texture its just red. When I open any other image file (like png) it loads fine. Someone please help me!
