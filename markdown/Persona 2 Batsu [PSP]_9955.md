- Post Title: Persona 2: Batsu [PSP]

Hi!
I am trying to see if I can get to the text of Persona 2: Batsu for PSP.
I didn't get any good results, but I did found a .cpk file.
When extracted, it extracts these files:



Now, I believe most of these files don't have anything that will help me out, but some of these files are called with names like "event", "poker", "ch_menu". These are likeky to be files that are meant to run a certain process in game (like opening a menu, playing poker), which leads me to believe that these may contain some text which could be translated.

If someone is interested in helping out, I can send them the files.
