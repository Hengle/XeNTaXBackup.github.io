- Post Title: The Monster Inside - assets archive crash

Hello, I want to extract text files, translate and import back into the .assets archive.

I use Unity Assets Explorer, but when I save it as a new archive, the game crash when I press Start in the game menu.

I tried Unity Assets Bundle Extractor, it don't crash, but when I click on Start in game menu, it show just background screen and nothing else.

Any other program to extract/rebuild assets archive with?

Thank you.

EDIT
--------------

Never mind. I figured I was importing/exporting the file the wrong way. Everything alright now! Sorry for this post 

Maybe someone struggle too, so here is what I did wrong.

I used Assets Bundle Extractor

Opened archive - click on file and press plugins - press export as text (.txt) - edit the file - to import do the samy thing, but now click on Import as text (.txt)

Save it and done.
