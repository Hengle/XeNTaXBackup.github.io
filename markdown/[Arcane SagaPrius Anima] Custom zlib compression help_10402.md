- Post Title: [Arcane Saga/Prius Anima] Custom zlib compression help

Hello XeNTax community. 
I have come to seek assistance on unpacking some custom zlib compression files from a new game that has opened this week.

You can download the game client here:
[http://as.netmarble.com](http://as.netmarble.com)

I am seeking someone that can unpack the .DAT files(4).
There are .IDX and .DAT files, the IDX tells where to find the files in the .DAT. It probably also holds the key to unlocking the file, if not then probably in the launcher.

My current tools do not work on the new files.

If you can help me or would like to figure this out that would be great!!! I need to get these asap. Thanks so much
