Good evening. I wanted to know if it was possible to obtain the complete models .hack//Games (IMOQ), frägment, G.U. Games and Link? I'm willing to wait as long as necessary but I'd love to see them. Waiting for any response, I thank you.

Sincerely, Seraphil.

I'm glad to finally see some more interest in this...


There is already a group of people working on this, myself included...
[viewtopic.php?f=16&t=2934](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=2934)


Currently non-animated models can be ripped with textures (and usually UV coordinates intact) from GU and Link (they are the same format)

IMOQ and likely fragment are slightly different versions of the format, and thus will need to be researched more before the converter works on them...

I should note that because Characters are animated, they are not yet supported, it's being worked on though... I think everyone wants characters and monsters mainly anyway.

As it stands, GU weapons are hit and miss, some extract perfectly, others are missing UV's and some only extract the textures... but, so far I'm happy with the progress. The unofficial leader of the project, however, is taking a bit of a break, working on a different project. 

I however, am actively working on decoding the character files... (Though I lack 99% of the experience of those who taught me, so, it may still be a while)

Okay. Thank you to you for giving me such explanations. I'll watch the topic you gave me regularly to see if there is new or not. I thank you.

Sincerely, Seraphil.
