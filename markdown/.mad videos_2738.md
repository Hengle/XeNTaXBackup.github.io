Starting a new thread over and over again won't bring you any further. It just starts to annoy me (and others as well I assume).
Despite I don't have much knowledge about video stuff I think converting a movie is much harder than just figuring out a format so there are fewer people who can do this and so the chance anybody can write a tool is lower.
Are you able to somehow contact the developers of that converter you attached?
btw attaching this converter doesn't really help to develop a tool for underground..the source code would help..

Indeed. I understand your frustration, Assasin, but don't think people haven't  looked at your post. They did, and perhaps even are in the process of puzzling out the format. Or they tried but failed. Or know they can't do it. It's not easy to figure out a video format, it takes a lot of time, and then if you know what you're looking for. And THEN you have to write a converter to get to the AVI files. That's a lot to ask for.

Exactly. The devs of that tool for most wanted are the ones that most probably can do a tool for underground too cause they have the knowledge about the mad format. I don't think it was changed that much.

Correct. Contact the authors of the previous tool. They're the experts.
