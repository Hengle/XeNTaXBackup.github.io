- Post Title: Filename for files after extraction?

Is there a filename list when extracting audio from games? I recently extracted the voice files from Far Cry 4 but all the filenames are File[insert number] and they are out of order. I'm new to the process and not sure if filenames can be found in the files or if community created after extraction.

Some archives have filenames, but lot don't.  Some filenames are encrypted too or stored elsewhere from the main audio archives.  Some just have file ID numbers.  So basically it's just luck if an archive has filenames or not.
