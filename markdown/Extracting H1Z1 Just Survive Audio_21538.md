- Post Title: Extracting H1Z1: Just Survive Audio

Hi all,

So for the past few weeks I’ve been attempting to extract audio files from the sound bank files and I’ve used many extractors such as the Wwise Sound Bank Extractor 1.0, Ravioli Extractor, QuickBMS and many more and I still can’t seem to extract any audio from them.

Once I did have somebody do it for me and he managed to extract the zombie sound effects but I’ve lost them sadly...

I have attached the sound bank files and I hope somebody can help me, thanks!
