- Post Title: 007 Goldeneye XBLA File Format Help

Recently the remastered n64 goldeneye game that was supposed to release ages ago got leaked and i wanted to know if there are any tools currently available to extract the games files.
Here are the file types:
Models - .bin
Textures - .rba
Sounds - There are 3 different files for the sounds, .xgs, .xsb and .xwb. xwb is the biggest out of them which i assume is the one with the actual sound files in them. Ive tried using the unxwb tool which extracts the .wav files but they produce an error when i ever i play any of them.
There are also some other file types that im not really sure about: .DT and .STR

I have attached a zip with a few of each file type here [https://www.mediafire.com/file/83rf1s8t ... s.zip/file](https://www.mediafire.com/file/83rf1s8ttrivh7c/007_XBLA_Files.zip/file)

The XWB files can be opened using [foobar2000](http://www.foobar2000.org/) with the [vgmstream plugin](http://www.foobar2000.org/components/view/foo_input_vgmstream). They appear to contain multiple tracks, which can then be exported as separate playable files once they're loaded into foobar.
