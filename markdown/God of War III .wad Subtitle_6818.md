I'm trying to translate the game into my language. But there is not any editor for .wad texts, is there? Can you create?

Here is all language files in game. (German, English, French, Italian, Japanese, Korean, NL?, Polski, PT?, Russian, ZH?)

NL = Dutch, PT = Portuguese, and ZH = Chinese. These are [ISO 639-1](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_639-1) alpha-2 language codes.

It is easy with HEX Editor but you can't use more characters than original..

I did not use any specific tool... Only a hex editor... I copy the text to a new file...

I did a tutorial a few months ago... is in Brazilian Portuguese... this is the link...
[http://www.romhacking.trd.br/index.php?topic=8021.0](http://www.romhacking.trd.br/index.php?topic=8021.0)

use the google to translate... if you need... and use the part [PS2] Lego (Batman, Star Wars 1 e 2, Indiana Jones)... To extract and reinsert the text is the same method... 

Sorry if this don't help... but if you try this... will work... I guarantee...
