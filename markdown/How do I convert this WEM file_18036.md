- Post Title: How do I convert this WEM file?

I have this .wem file [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1iiIh9r ... sp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1iiIh9rXJEIH8NGAlrV235ZSbsN6CqKam/view?usp=sharing) from the Windows version of Civilization VI and ww2ogg wont convert it, it gives an error "expected 0x42 fmt if vorb missing". Other .wem files from the game (e.g. various music pieces) seem to work correctly when run through ww2ogg so I know ww2ogg 

Can anyone tell me what I need to do to convert this file into something I can listen to? Is it in some format other than ogg? (and if so what converter do I need?)

Turns out its not OGG at all, its WW ADPCM and this tool [https://github.com/MRWITEK/wwise-adpcm-to-wave-adpcm](https://github.com/MRWITEK/wwise-adpcm-to-wave-adpcm) converts the file into a .wav file I can play.

Looks like the game uses files with a third codec as well as the OGG and WW ADPCM formats.

And this one turns out to be wwise PCM. So now I have all 3 codecs used by Civilization VI figured out to the point I can start doing what I want (sound explorer tool for it
