- Post Title: W40K Inquisitor Martyr [request]

Would anyone be willing and have a look at the Inquisitor Martyr models?
It's running on an upgraded version of the Van Helsing game engine. I noticed the extractor provided in [this](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=12582) thread  still works, the importer, however, unfortunately doesn't.
I've provided a sample, both of a model (.vhm) and the archive (.N2PK) it was in.

The Van Helsing thread is already two years old, and i didn't want to resurrect it.

Thank you for your efforts. It'll probably take a year till i understand enough of the basics to get usable results myself, but i realize you can't always get things served on a silver tray.
I appreciate the startup help.
