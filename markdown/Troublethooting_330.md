You work with the Mex3Scriptor?

Please post the script here . 
Just enter the script as you wanted to compile it (before pressing save), select the text, copy it, and paste it here as a reply, please. Then I will have a look at it!

It works?

Allright, still, which archive format is that and can you show me the script? If it works, I would like to implement it in future releases! And credit you of course
