- Post Title: Extracting contents of HMMSYS data.pak - Rising Kingdoms

Hello everyone, I'm trying to access the files contained in the data.pak file for the game Rising Kingdoms. I am looking for a solution that extracts and reimports the files inside the original to be able to perform a translation for the game. I will share a public link to the .pak file to be analyzed. I am grateful for any help you can offer me, thank you!
