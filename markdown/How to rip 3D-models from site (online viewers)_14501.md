- Post Title: How to rip 3D-models from site (online viewers)?

I want to rip 3D-models from two sites- [http://phoboslab.org/wipeout/](http://phoboslab.org/wipeout/) and [http://jeux.vonc.fr/urbanchaos/lecteur_prm.html](http://jeux.vonc.fr/urbanchaos/lecteur_prm.html) The authors create the models viewers for the old games ( Wipeout and Urban Chaos ) from PlayStation One, but not added the ability to download 3D-models. On the request by e-mail does not reply (apparently their accounts long since abandoned). Is it possible to rip and download the models from this sites?
