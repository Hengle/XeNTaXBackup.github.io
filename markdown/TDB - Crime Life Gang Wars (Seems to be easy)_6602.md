- Post Title: TDB - Crime Life Gang Wars (Seems to be easy)

I'm trying to translate the game Crime Life Gang Wars, the text file is a TDB. It's a table inside the other, I could understand many things about its format but still can not extract and compress the file.

Does anyone know a script or a function in the Delphi language to extract and compress this file?

Thanks
