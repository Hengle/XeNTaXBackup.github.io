- Post Title: Audio clips are missing

I have a Unity game for PC and have all the assets from it, but it's missing only the audio clips. I searched and searched every folder and file, checked all the asset and bundle files with asset studio, and I can not find it. I tried also looking up a solution and there's no answer to it, only that the asset studio dev. said they can be encrypted for some games. Can someone please help me or tell me what folder should show up that will have it? I already checked the main game folder and unity folder in appdata, and I do not find those bnk or acb files or any file that can be converted. I don't know what other folder that can be created when the game installs. Any help would be great.

It would help a lot if you stated what game in question so others could investigate this on the file level than just throw random guesses at the 'problem'

If there are no audioclips in the unity archives, it just means the audio is handled by separate audio engine related archives that can be more 'custom' besides obfuscation measures being employed possibly.

Some games store files in 'documents folder' but that is usually savegames and replays etc sort.
