I second that....

The only reason i uninstalled this game was because i spent hours searching all over for an extractor and tried everything that i know of try it and nothing would work. Watto's Game Extractor didn't work and neither did any type of BMS script that i tried.

I'm mainly after the sound files and textures just to even look would be great.

This is the script for MultiEx Commander to open *.000 files that have a accompanying *.DFS file in the same folder. It will show the correct filenames. 

Here's the BMS file to use in MultiEx Commander. Just go to BMS-->Add BMS to MRF and follow the instructions. Point to the BMS file and name the game.
