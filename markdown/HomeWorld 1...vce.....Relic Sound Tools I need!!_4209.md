"*.Vce" file must be HomeWorld sound file, right?
Does it include voice and sound files?

The URL above is nothing.

Can someone give me "Relic Sound Tools"?

First of all. Thank you.


and 
Can the "rlc_sound_tools.exe" convert sound files to wave(wma, mp3 and ogg etc.)?
Does it allow me to just listen sounds with Winamp?
Is there any way?

I think you can only extract files. What is the extension the files extracted from the .VCE have?
