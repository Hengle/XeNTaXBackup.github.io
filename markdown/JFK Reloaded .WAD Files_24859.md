- Post Title: JFK Reloaded .WAD Files

Hello, for about 2 years now i have been trying to rip the Meshes and Textures from JFK Reloaded. A old game from 2004 that simulates the assassination of 35th US President John Fitzgerald Kennedy. I am mainly looking for the SS-100-XX mesh, and the character meshes. I don't understand Hex Editing, and i have tried countless programs that support the .WAD file format and none of them have succeeded. I really have no idea what the issue is. NinjaRipper is able to rip the character meshes and textures, but they come out with polygons missing and unintelligible UV-Mapping. I unfortunately cannot upload a sample for experimentation, i have to upload the whole .WAD file. I understand if this post gets taken down, and i greatly apologize for any inconvenience i may have caused. 

core000.WAD file: [https://drive.google.com/file/d/17THlS2 ... IPC4r/view](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17THlS2GDNrS2NJLIUheiBhfl6E_IPC4r/view)

EDIT: I forgot to mention, i think this game runs on Renderware or something? I'm unsure, but by reading the core000.wad file in Notepad, i notice a lot of references to .anm, .txd, and .mdl files. And .mtl files too, which i think is associated with Renderware? I don't really know.

There are some topics already with discussion of WAD file format, so you can check them first
[viewtopic.php?t=17687](https://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?t=17687)

As for the engine, it's not RenderWare for sure, it seems to be modified Carmaggedon engine (BRender).

I may have a look at this archive later.

I was able to create quickbms script for extracting all files from the WAD archive

I have also created this article for future reference
