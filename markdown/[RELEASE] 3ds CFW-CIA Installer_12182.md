That is interesting, but how would I go about installing this custom firmware on a 3ds?

More or less:
You have to be in firmware 4.5
Backup your NAND
Write it to the sector one of your SD
Install the homebrew ROP loader using this: [http://filetrip.net/3ds-downloads/homeb ... 32915.html](http://filetrip.net/3ds-downloads/homebrew/download-rop-multi-loader-1-2-f32915.html)
Go launch the exploit(system settings, other settings, ds profile)
Then follow the tutorial on my site!

dammit, foiled by the 4.5 requirement.
Oh how I can't wait for there to be the same thing on uptodate systems.

For this you'll have to wait. We can't find everydays a SYSTEM exploit/ security flaw y'know.
