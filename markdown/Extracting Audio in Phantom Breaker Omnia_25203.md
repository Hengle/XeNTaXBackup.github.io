- Post Title: Extracting Audio in Phantom Breaker Omnia

I've tried looking into how to break into the .BIN files for the game, but I have no idea what I'm doing. Something about making your own BMS script if that's what's even needed, but I don't even know how. I've seen various strands of letters that keep reappearing through the BIN files in Hex Editor... like CIOU, CBMS, etc. but no idea what to even do.
