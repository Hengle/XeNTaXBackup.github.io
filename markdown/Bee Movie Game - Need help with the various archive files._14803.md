- Post Title: Bee Movie Game - Need help with the various archive files.

The Bee Movie game was released on PC, Wii, Xbox 360, and PS2. Each version of the game uses different archive files. I have provided sample files for each version of the game - 

The Xbox 360 version has everything stored in .pkz files:

[http://www.mediafire.com/download/c6vxv ... veCity.pkz](http://www.mediafire.com/download/c6vxvejkwb6hgke/HiveCity.pkz) 

The Wii version uses .xwi for its archive format:

[http://www.mediafire.com/download/yx0h8 ... 0_Hive.xwi](http://www.mediafire.com/download/yx0h8rccu8190n5/C0_Hive.xwi)

and the PC version stores everything in .pak files:

[http://www.mediafire.com/download/559gk ... veCity.pak](http://www.mediafire.com/download/559gknneuncki10/HiveCity.pak)

With the PC version, Dragon Unpacker manages to rip textures but it won't find any models.

As for the PS2 version... I won't even bother with it since EVERYTHING is stored in a data.dat file which is 1 GB in size.

Can someone please take a look at the files I provided and see if we can get anything useful out of them?
