- Post Title: Epic Mickey .nif_wii files

The Epic Mickey community and I have been trying to open these files for years now. They seem to contain texture data (in Printfox/Pagefox format(?)) and model data. It also seems to be a variation of the .nif file format from Gamebryo 2.5, but optimized for Wii. NifSkope claims to support it, but spits out garbage data. I've attached a beta model in this format that we haven't been able to open. Any help would be appreciated!

Getting the mesh directly from that nif (version 20.6.5.0) is not too hard (hex2obj, view link in my sig):

You have no idea how happy this made me and community members. Thank you so much. This model is from a early demo from 2 years before release. Thank you again!!!
