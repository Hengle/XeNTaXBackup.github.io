- Post Title: Scribblenauts String Files.

I want to translate Scribblenauts into my Native language.

I found this topic viewtopic.php?t=10131 and downloaded ScribbleExport.exe, it exports all files but is somehow corrupted and not in default file format. 

Besides that, I can't import the translations I made into the game. Is there any way someone can help? Thanks in advance.
