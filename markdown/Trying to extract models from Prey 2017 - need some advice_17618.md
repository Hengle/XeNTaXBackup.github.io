- Post Title: Trying to extract models from Prey 2017 - need some advice

I'll preface this - This is the first time i've ever done anything with game 3D models. I'm trying to learn how some of this fits together. I wanted to 3D Print some of the models from Prey. 

I'm getting import errors and cant seem to get more than the basic "points" of the skeleton to load. I know the game was made with CryEngine4, and the cryengine converter ([https://github.com/Markemp/Cryengine-Converter](https://github.com/Markemp/Cryengine-Converter)) doesn't work on these files (maybe why cryengine5 doesn't either?).

I've read through this thread and had success getting texture files and decrypting the PAK files: [https://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=16241](https://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=16241) 

Do I need a copy of cryengine4? Any tips to load the models? Can I use another tool to load the .chr files? They wont load in 3DSMax since they were generated by cryengine.

Have you tried this?
It's for skinned meshes only.

People have reported that Cryengine Converter works for static meshes, but I had no luck with it.

I'll give it a try tonight. I searched the forum but somehow missed that post, thanks!

Edit: Works great, a lot of the creature models are mostly animations in game so there isnt much for a skeleton, but it works great!
