Hello!!! I been trying to extract some models from final fantasy mobius the steam version using Unity Studio, but so fair I have only found the texture files but not the actual model files. I was hoping to find the Aerith Mobius model, but no luck. Can anyone help guide me through this? Or maybe tell me what I could be doing wrong. Thank you! All advice is appreciated!
