- Post Title: Marc Ecko's Getting Up - Contents Under Pressure

I finally found a way to extract the music from marc ecko contents under pressure
first copy the files in the music folder 
game folder/marc ecko/engine/music
to any other folder you want
then use extension renamer
[http://www.softpicks.net/software/Exten ... -21388.htm](http://www.softpicks.net/software/Extension-renamer-21388.htm) 
and then rename all the files from .mus to .mp3
there u have it all marc ecko's songs in the game
you'll now have to left click every file and rename the music files correctly
according to those in ur ipod
note that some files r not songs they're just ingame voices
i attached a full savegame with all soundtracks unlocked in the ipod to
help u name the soundtracks with the correct artist's name[/u]
