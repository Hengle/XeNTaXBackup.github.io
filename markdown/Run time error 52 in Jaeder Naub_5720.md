- Post Title: Run time error 52 in Jaeder Naub?

Every time I try to select a certain file to open in Jaeder Naub, I get an error message "Run-time error '52': bad file name or number". The file in question is a 16 GB drive image (the file directory seems to have been corrupted and I'm attempting to recover files from it), and I get the error upon trying to select the file in both JN 2.2.0a and 2.2.4g experimental. Any ideas? Does JN perhaps have an upper file size limit on what it can open?
