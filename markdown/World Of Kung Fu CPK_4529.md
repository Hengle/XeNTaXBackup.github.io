- Post Title: World Of Kung Fu CPK

Hello,

I'd like someone to help me with this game archive (.cpk)

There is a extractor for it already, but it is encrypted by themida software, means that it gets detected as a virus, which it is not. And it doesn't work in Windows 7 Home Edition, any mode, right. Even tried to run it in a virtual machine, didn't work either.

(Program: [http://homepage.ntlworld.com/steve.harris70/Cpack.rar](http://homepage.ntlworld.com/steve.harris70/Cpack.rar))

I attached one of the smallest cpk's I could find in through the folders.

Tnx,
Ghostt

Ok, I just got my friend (using XP) to extract the files from the cpk.

So this can give you a idea of the tree and files in it.

Tnx
