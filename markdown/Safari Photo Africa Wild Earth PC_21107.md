hi, can I ask for help with a file format I am trying to extract/repack, I am trying to mod an old game called Safari Photo Africa Wild Earth for PC, and I am trying to make it so I can make new models or replace them ingame, a blender addon/quickbms unpack repack would be great if anyone would do it, thanks in advance

"repacking"? yeah - don't be too greedy.  
Start unpacking the *.sxm using offzip (use forum search on how to use it).
.
Using hex2obj with *.dat (view links in my sig):

Not trying to be greedy or anything, because its an old dx9 game, I can mod textures with it using texmod, but I am trying to inject new models into the game, like replace or add animals, etc using blender and export them into wild earth, like is it possible or someone can help me with this?

this is for personal use, not making public mods or anything like that
