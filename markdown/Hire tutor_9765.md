Chrrox's tutorials should be enough to get you started.
At least, that's how I figured out how it all works.

Basic model converting: [viewtopic.php?f=29&t=3739](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=29&t=3739)
Importing with noesis: [viewtopic.php?f=29&t=7760](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=29&t=7760)

Obviously, you will require motivation to get anywhere.
I don't have motivation, and therefore I only got as far as importing meshes with textures.
