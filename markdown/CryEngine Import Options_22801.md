Hello guys,

does anyone know a way to open 3D models based on the CryEngine Engine in any program? Importing the animations would be important.
Can this even be done directly with the CryEngine software with export as fbx or another data format?

Many Thanks!

Best Regards

A bit of search would have answered that for you, except animations are not reversed, yet, as far as i know.
