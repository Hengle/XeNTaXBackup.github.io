Hello I were checking this unity web files and them have their filename and also if is mesh, animation, material, etc. I had same issue in the past due this models doesn't contain any texture, but it was inside the .mat file, I was trying to get  the texture but without success, someone had this kind of issue in the past or know how to get the textures?    . Thanks for your time.

Usually I add the name of the game, but this time the apk name is "214027.apk" and cannot be installed in bluestack
