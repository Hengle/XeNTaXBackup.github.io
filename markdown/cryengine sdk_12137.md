Most assets that aren't encrypted (.pak files, such as the object.pak file) can be loaded up into the SDK and the assets viewed.  It also has a handy .obj exporter as well.

greets.

Unencrypted or signed .paks you can import into the SDK.  Encrypted ones you have to decrypt first.

If they are encrypted, then decrypting them is probably against the TOS and probably should be left alone.
