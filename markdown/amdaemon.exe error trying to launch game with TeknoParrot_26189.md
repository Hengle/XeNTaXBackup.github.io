- Post Title: amdaemon.exe error trying to launch game with TeknoParrot

I tried to open the game and it closed after the "have fun ", this was the message returned by amdaemon:

<< 2023/01/13 20:55:50 >>

Runtime exception occurred.

File: D:\Jenkins\workspace\amdaemon_all_build\libs\libamw\src\amw_platform_manager.cpp

Line: 102

Function: void __cdecl am::platform::Manager::initialize(void)

Message: amPlatformGetPlatformInformation(). ErrCode 0.

How can I fix this and what does this message means?
