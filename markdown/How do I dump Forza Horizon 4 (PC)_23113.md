- Post Title: How do I dump Forza Horizon 4? (PC)

UWPDumper doesn't work with the game, and I want to dump the files so I can access vehicle files. I've searched through the internet, making searches like "FH4 files" (just get the "Car Files" story in the game)  and "FH4 dump" (just get some science-y thingy and some furry livestream of the game...wtf?) Is there another way to dump this game?

Edit: I don't want to see a solution involved with piracy or "FH4 patch".

Probably you need to be more precise with what are you trying to do like:

1. What do you mean by "dumping"? You want to ripp some files from game when it is running? Or you are trying to extract data from archives?

2. What are the files you are trying to dump? What types are they? Images, videos, archives? What extensions they have? You told us something about vehicle files, but what do you mean by that?

3. Tell us what you are planning to do with those files and what is your goal here.

4. Describe with details what you have done already. Noone will try to help you if you don't show us what methods did you already tried.
Also attach some screenshots. We may understand your situation better then.

Great, it seems that nobody cares.

If you don't give enough information, yes nobody will care

I know would like to get my hands on the sound files to see if any proper names could be produced.
