I was looking in the files of this game and there was a folder MDL, which I assumed contained models in it, but instead had these strange files with an OLM extension. I took a look in a hex editor, and a chunk of the file at the bottom was lyrics data..

so overall I honestly have no idea what could be inside. I'm mainly looking for the textures, models, and the maps themselves.

If you'd like a sample, PM me.
