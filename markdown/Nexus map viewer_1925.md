Is it possible to view all the maps from Nexustk (kingdom of winds) with some kind of program? All the files are .cmp's and I am clueless on how to view these..

Yes it's Possible, go and find it in [HERE](http://www.kamikazeserver.com/forums/)
What U need are :
- CMP to MAP Converter
- Tile*.Dat Extractor (can use either Watto or Xentax)
- MAP Editor (Source code in VB6) Don't mess up with Baram Map Editor 4.0

Thanks man, I tried the CMP converter from Kamikaze but it came up with an error about the file "COMDLG32.OCx" saying it is either missing or invalid, I got that for the Kamikaze launcher too

**Edited** Nevermind I got it fixed thanks again
