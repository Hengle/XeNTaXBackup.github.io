- Post Title: How can I extract all the script but mode-offline?

Hello guys I found my favourite game and I would love to know how can I extract all the script but offline because if you tried to extract the script you got some script like SmartFoxClient and I was doing research and is like a mode-online but I don't want that I just want the script normal like offline but I do not know how... does anyone know how can I extract everything but without smarfoxclient because the old game I found is from 2014 and it is with unity 3.5.6f4 and that version is so old but I know how to use that version in unity but I do not know how to extract everything without error or something missing... if someone know how, just reply this message
