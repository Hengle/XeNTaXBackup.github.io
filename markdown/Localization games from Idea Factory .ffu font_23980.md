- Post Title: Localization games from Idea Factory .ffu font

I want to translate games from IF, but I ran into a problem when translating. The font either doesn't support characters, or the character kerning is too large, and I want to fix it.
Are there any programs or scripts to unpack .ffu files?
There are sample files.
