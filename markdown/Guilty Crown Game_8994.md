ha ha ha yeah, you know, over the last year i've seen lots of models, mainly anime ones... i'm even thinking about taking everything i've learned here and maybe take a stab at modeling something from an anime like that kakomiki guy did...

shit man, and just when i was thinking of retiring from this... the PS3 K-ON game is coming out, a new Atelier game is coming out too...

Cool, thanks Ares! I'll check those out when I have some time. I found the Guilty Crown model and messed with it for a few hours, cleaning it up in LightWave. It was a real mess.
