you probably have figured that out by now, but what you want to do is not possible right now...you can open all those files you mentioned in a simple text editor though...sth like notepad ++
we need to be able to extract .rpack files (already partly possible ) and recompress  the edited files into a new rpack or reinject them into an old ones (already possible with small .rpacks with offzip and packzip ....but doesn't work that well)
