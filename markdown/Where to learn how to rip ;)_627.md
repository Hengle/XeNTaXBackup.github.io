- Post Title: Where to learn how to rip? ;)

Hi,

first,congrats for your tool and all the work done behind!

i'm searching a tutorial who explain how to rip and convert to an usable way,an unpack routine from a game.

even if its already done,i've often seen small dos unpack tools (eg.40960 bytes) for differents game.

so i think its only a matter to analyze the code and adapt it to a standard template.

i've still asm knowledge,not total newbie but not enough skill to learn everything from scratch.

any help?

hope not being flamed 



thanks in advance!
