I had hoped for a tool that was going to work with Painkiller out of the box ( as I was led to believe it did ) - didn't know I had to be a freakin coder to get it to work.
You coders are great guys though - it's just that I don't know how to do it ( math kills my head )

I guess coders aren't as up on the dynamics of human conversation as I had hoped.
My point is, since it doesn't work out of the box, what needs to be done to get it to work ?
Frankly, the read me file is a bit cryptic to someone just getting started with this stuff.
But then again, if we ( Painkiller owmers) had access to PainEd ( it exists and I have proof ) then none of this would be an issue......

"Since...it...doesn't work out of the box" 

- what is it? You refer to Painfull? We do have more tools here. 
Painfull does not work on your Painkiller *.PAK files, is that what you are saying?

- If so, you refer to the readme file as cryptic? Why, that is really strange, because I really don't think it's that difficult to read. 
For instance, what exactly in the words 
"Just browse to a PAK file of your choice at the left side 
of the tool, select it in the file-list, and hit "Open Painkiller PAK". 
You will notice the contents (entries) listed to the right." 
do you NOT understand. 

Frankly, it seems non-coders aren't as up to the dynamics of reading as I had hoped. However, I wouldn't want to speak for all non-coders, because the majority that uses the tool without any problems in operating it are in fact non-coders. The problem therefore may be with you. Some would say this is a classic case of RTFM (Read The Fucking Manual), and you might get lucky if you did actually. Would have saved you the trouble of posting here. 

Next time take heed of the following: knocking on a coders' door with just the words "it doesn't work", will not give you much response in most cases. Why? Because there are probably a lot of reasons why it wouldn't work, not in the least because some people indeed DON'T read the manual, have a screwed up computer anyhow, or are simply too ignorant to be even allowed to operate a complex machine like a computer without having proper insurance. 

I have nothing against helping people, as those who have used the tool will acknowledge, but there is standard dose of mutual respect needed for any help to be offered. If you have trouble with this, I really don't think the release of PainEd will you do you any more good, it might just be too complicated for you to operate. 

Thing is, PainEd is NOT released, so I helped a couple of guys out with this program. For free. And they appreciated it. That's all I need.

Wow.
OK...
Let's start over here, perhaps ?
I think it's a great effort, and I've no doubt that it works for a number of other people.
However, it isn't working for me.
I installed the 1.15 patch for PK, which may have sometyhing to do with it.
Now, I apologize for your having taken offense to my glib statement about coders - it was only meant in fun, really.
But in an effort to correct your perceptions about non-coders, just because we do not excel in coding does not make us a bunch of idiots.
I RTFM - problem is, RTFM is a waste of time when TGFP doesn't do what one is assured it will do as a result of RTFM.

So, no, were it as simple as merely browsing to the pak file of my choice and opening it, then I wouldn't need to be here stating that attempting to do so fails to work.
You went to a great length to insult me, but that's ok, I've done it to other people at times myself, so I view it as merely fate keeping the balance restored. 
Aside from that, I'm far too intelligent in general, even though I'm not a coder, to let such little barbs have any effect.
Anyway - Getting it to recognize the painkiller pak files and extract them without any errors is the goal here.
If you want to help with that, then hey, great, I would appreciate it.
If not, just say so and I'll scrap the program and look for something else.

Additionally, in re PainEd : 

As is stated here, [http://www.peoplecanfly.com/](http://www.peoplecanfly.com/)
in the "Engine" section, there are supposed to be editing tools available

And by using a resource viewer program, to view the file paingame.exe, the following is but an excerpt of one of the entries in the stringtable section :

Hell, there's even an entry for it in the registry...

Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00

[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\PeopleCanFly\PainEdito
r]

[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\PeopleCanFly\PainEdito
r\Recent Item List]

[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\PeopleCanFly\PainEdito
r\Settings]

This would seem to indicate that, even though PainEd has not been released, it has insisted upon partially installing itself ANYWAY....
All the resources for PainEd are compressed within Paingame.exe.
It strikes me that it may very likely be a case of the setup program on the CD's simply not installing the executable / dll's / etc.. to the installation folder.
Maybe PainEd is run by means of appending a command line switch to the Painkiller shortcut ?
Surely a coder would have a much greater chance of figuring out the possibilities here, as I am just a non-coder who can barely even read my own writing and am forced by 12 countries to have insurance on any computer i get within 25 feet of.....

And first you tell me that you don't give a damn if someone "insults" you, as you have such a high intelligence. ...

Anyway, you should learn to read the forum here, becasue I reckon there are more people maybe that have the same problem that you have in getting Painfull to run. Perhaps the problem was solved somewhere. 

You keep giving no information other than "it doesn't work". How do you think anyone can be of assistance if that is all that you tell them. Look around, see how people actually describe their problem in enough detail so we can perhaps extrapolate when went wrong. Something basic, like OS running, MultiEx Commander installed yes/no, stuff like that. But no, you chose to go on about how unhelpful I am and how silly I am in taking your words for offence. Instead, try explaining what the problem is in detail.

About PainEd, I'm sure you know there's a thread on this very subject at DreamCatcher's Painkiller Creative Corner forum. A thread which I follow.

And according to MultiEx Archive Format Binder, the pak files for painkiller are not supported, as they appear nowhere in the list

So MultiEx will not load painkiller pak files.
I'm not clear as to why it was felt necessary to have Painfull rely on the installation of MultiEx in order for it to work -  because, frankly, it just does not .

Ahhh, screw it - the program doesn't offer support for painkiller ( don't know why you can't go ahead and admit that)
But trying to get any help out of you is like talking to a crackhead.
And the whole idea of making people be online to use this program is not only lame, but hell there's not even any advantage to it......
But, then again, there doesn't seem to be any advantage to having the program in the first place, online requirement or not - as neither of them do what Painkiller users need them to do.
And since trying to get any help out of you is, as I said, no more productive than arguing with a crackhead - I'm out.
I'm not a coder, I freely admit that.
Perhaps it would behoove you to consider employing a like degree of honesty about your "skills".

That is in fact true. The Painkiller files are not yet supported in MultiEx Commander. 

*I had created a special version of the Multiex executable for users that couldn't wait until the new release. IF you use that version, it should always start with a message at the beginning stating that you just started an unofficial version. 

The painkiller.dll file however that is used by PAINFULL (which doesn't need MultiEx Commander per se, but some support DLL's are in there that Painfull DOES need) is not the same version as the painfull.dll that came with the unofficial version of the MultiEx executable. So when you run the unofficial version of MultiEx Commander with the new painkiller.dll OR run the official version of MultiEx Commander with any version of painkiller.dll, the error you show will occur. 

Why do you not start Painfull by the way, and use that version of MultiEx Commander? FYI painfull=/=multiexcommander. 
I advise you to try and run Painfull to open these PAK files, OR use the old painkiller.dll that comes with the test version of the MultiEx Commander executable.

EDIT 
Ah, I see you have added more insulting text while I was replying and actually helping you. 
Look, it is you who is at fault here. Not me. 

1. You started off wrong, providing little to no information about your problem, but claiming this was all due some coder's fault, never your own. 
2. Then after some words, you continue to NOT give any information about your problem, instead increasingly talking about matters that don't have any bearing on your actual problem. 
3. Finally, you come up with a log from MultiEx Commander. Which is indeed helpful as it provides me with some insights in what you have been doing before you got the error (= not read all there was to read about the subject), and what you could do to help prevend it in the future. 
4. Then, while I was giving you the details, you decide to edit your last post and take more potshots at me. All of a sudden dragging in the online usage option, which, as you might have known had you READ anything about the subject here on the forum that is MEANT to answer any questions you may have, is already removed in the upcoming version of MultiEx Commander. 

Again, had you actually read anything here on the forum, you woudl have seen that a lot of people have actually had succes with Painfull, check out the MExModCentral for instance. BarfHappy even posted a nice "Thank you Mr.Mouse" over at DreamCatcher's forum. 

I don't know exactly what your problem is, but it looks like it has got nothing to do with MultiEx Commander or Painfull. 

Nice to have been of assistance in helping you find out the real problem.

OK, good - now we're getting somewhere.
I don't imagine you could post quick links to those files so I am assured of getting the exact ones you make reference to ?

EDIT : No, actually my real problem is that when I download a program that someone has released for use, I feel I have every right to expect it to work as "advertised"
When it does not, and my statement that it does not is met only with some wiseassed response, yeah - I tend not reply so kindly.
After all, the version I downloaded was not labeled as a beta version.
Therefore, all the bugs should have been worked out.
Am I the only one of us who gets this ?
And this approach towards new people who have a problem getting the program to do what it's supposed to - telling them "The answer to your problem is out there in the forums, go find it" is just lazy and unhelpful to the degree of being insultingly snobbish.
If you know where the answers are, provide links, at the very least, should an absence of interest in establishing any manner of dialogue with said user exist on your part.
But for you to just assume that a user is too stupid to RTFM just because their first post or two wasn't loaded with copied / pasted information, and thus are deserving of your attempt at ridicule is as blindly stupid as it is of the developers of Painkiller to assume that all of us users are too stupid to use the tools that would constitute PainEd.

well, Mr Mouse is coding for fun, and make it public to please people who might find it usefull. It took me 30 seconds to download painfull, launch it and open the pak i wanted. 

Thing is, by acting like that you are spoiling his fun and if too many people do like you he won t code anymore. So let s keep calm

btw i am a coder too, r&d software engineer at the french national institute of research in computers, before that i worked for Etoile (japanese game studio) and American Megatrends Japan... and with that point of view i am perfectly pleased that Mr Mouse cares to take time to make something usefull.

Thanks, BarfHappy.

It does work as advertised. If you read the whole Painkiller *.pak thread 
( [viewtopic.php?t=664](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?t=664) )
you will find the complete advertisement: how it came to existence, what to expect, and problems discussed. It really does work as advertised. 

> When it does not, and my statement that it does not is met only with some wiseassed response, yeah - I tend not reply so kindly.

You started with nothing that could point me in the right direction of where the problem lay and even entitled the thread "Well crap...", clearly showing discontentment. I asked what your point was, because I could not extrapolate which program ran faulty when. 

> After all, the version I downloaded was not labeled as a beta version. Therefore, all the bugs should have been worked out.
>
> Am I the only one of us who gets this ?

That's bullshit. Show me a program that was never patched or updated after release. "All the bugs should have been worked out" is not a realistic view. In theory, of course, anyone would agree, but in practice, it's impossible. Especially for tools such as MultiEx Commander, that are under continues development. As for Painfull it is even more nonsense, bcause it was clearly stated that it was done as a favor to some fans of the game, nothing more nothing less. 

> And this approach towards new people who have a problem getting the program to do what it's supposed to - telling them "The answer to your problem is out there in the forums, go find it" is just lazy and unhelpful to the degree of being insultingly snobbish.

It is clear you are not a coder, because if you were and had created something that attracts a lot of people, you would have experienced the vast number of really silly, stupid and completely insulting comments or posts that one can get. From  "CREATE SUPPORT FOR THIS GAME NOW!!!", "PROGRAM NOT WORK - FIX NOW" to "I DL-ED MULTIEX NOW IT DOES NOT START WITH MY GAME - IT Is NOT IN THE SUPPORT LIST - WHY DOES IT NOT START". Really. I'm not kidding. 

You are calling me lazy? You want everything served immediately on a dish, and quickly at that. You refuse to even read the forum to find your answer, a forum which in principle is there to cover known issues and present possible answers. I have no intention in explaining over and over again something which was already discussed and fixed. Try some other forums, you will be told the same. Search the forum for your error and if it is not covered, then you can start to post. But don't barge in here and demand stuff. It's just not polite. 

> If you know where the answers are, provide links, at the very least, should an absence of interest in establishing any manner of dialogue with said user exist on your part.

As I said, I rather have people look for the answer first in the threads that cover their problem. 

> But for you to just assume that a user is too stupid to RTFM just because their first post or two wasn't loaded with copied / pasted information, and thus are deserving of your attempt at ridicule is as blindly stupid as it is of the developers of Painkiller to assume that all of us users are too stupid to use the tools that would constitute PainEd.

I have never assumed that, and I never will. It really does all come down to how someone formulates their issue, and what attitude they show.

As most that have come here will agree, I have always been helpful, even if the questions looked stupid in their eyes. I don't believe there are stupid questions. But I don't like people that demand something from someone who is developing a tool completely for free, who is spending money on his website to make the tool available to those who want it for free (really, no-one is forcing you to download anything here, and even if you do, it won't cost you anything,the fact that you do actually costs US) and who is completely devoted in helping people support this or that game free of any obligation. I don't think such demands are in anyway justified. But that's my view, and you will have to make do with that view. 

oh, and I posted the link you need already. It's the painkiller *.pak thread above. The very same thread you dl-ed the painkiller.dll from.

Ok - so I got Painful and it works fine.
Which then begs the question, What does anyone NEED MultiEx for ?
Yes, when you consider that there a a great many other games to mod, it IS a stupid question - but I am only concerned with PK at the moment, so...
And the thing that had me so bent was trying to make sense of how to "program" MultiEx to recognize the PK Pak file.
I do find it interesting, though, that it seems to be that PainEd could be enabled with a few scripting changes...
I found this script, and it does indeed indicate that PainEd is an integral part of the game itself, and that it has simply been made dormant.
View for yourself and consider :
