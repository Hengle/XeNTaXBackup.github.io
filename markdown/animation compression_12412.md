Hi

Please help how to decode quaternion compression 48bit (15bit+15bit+15bit+3bit) used by Cryengine.

Are you sure there is nothing like this in the unreal engine 4 source code?
I imagine the last few bits contain the sign for w

Yes i have seen this topic.
I can't write script with full of ^ or & or >> symbols. I don't understand language bits operation.
I need some code.

If you mean bms then I can't really help. I only know the c languages

```
 s0 = 1.41421*(s0-0x3FFF)/0x7FFF
  s1 = 1.41421*(s1-0x3FFF)/0x7FFF
  s2 = 1.41421*(s2-0x3FFF)/0x7FFF
  s3 = sqrt(1-(s0^2+s1^2+s2^2))

  case AxisFlg of (
   3: return (quat s2 s1 s0 s3)
   2: return (quat s2 s1 s3 s0)
   1: return (quat s2 s3 s1 s0)
   0: return (quat s3 s2 s1 s0)
  )--end case

```

"You can find more details in the 'QuatQuantization.h'."

This header file should help us further but it doesn't seem to be part of the CryEngine 3 SDK.

I found out more about this possible representation by checking out the  Lua decompiler (LOL)

So in our case 
the Bias might be
