- Post Title: Chrome Workshop (in-game text editor for Dying Light)

Chrome Workshop provides a graphical interface for reading, editing, and converting between Dying Light .bin and .csv strings files.

Download / Instructions / Tutorial

Requirements:

[Microsoft .NET Framework 4.5.2](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=42642)

Future Plans:

Add .bin files to .pak files directly
Update .bin files already in .pak files directly
Manage .scr and .xml mods (add, remove, merge)
Create and edit .scr and .xml mods with a graphical interface

I should thank MiRiKan for his [drag-and-drop unpacker/packer](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=35&t=12549). I built off his work and then went crazy with it.
