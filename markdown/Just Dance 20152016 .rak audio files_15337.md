Hello everyone!

I was trying to find a way to convert the .rak audio files that are in these games into a working .wav format and I stumbled upon a couple posts on the site about the same thing on similar files from other Ubisoft games, but the whole "XMA Transform + XMA Parse + ToWav" procedure didn't work for me, as on the first step QuickBMS seemed to go on and on forever without having any result but encountering countless "parse errors".

Can someone tell me what I did wrong or the right way to convert these files, if this is not the one?
