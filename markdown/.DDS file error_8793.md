- Post Title: .DDS file error

I apologize if this has been asked before, but I couldn't seem to find it anywhere.

I'm trying to open a .DDS (not .dds as the other files are), in Photoshop CS2 and I'm getting the error:

Could not complete your request because the file-format could not parse the file.

But when I open the same file in IrfanView, it comes out black- I can barely make out what it is... is there another program I can open this with that will allow me to convert it into a .tga while still keeping its color?

send it to me via PM, and describe what it is supposed to contain if you can and i'll take a quick look at it to see if anything is wrong with the header.
the DDS plugin for photoshop sucks BTW.

Why not just encode it in base-64?

OK, first file, the one with .DDS, the head, is actually a 32-bit TGA file with it's footer missing. By default, Irfanview displays 32-bit TGA files correctly, but you have to disable those alpha channels (they probably need to be inverted or they are just flat out invalid, didn't really check). So rename to TGA and then open irfanview, then go to Options > Properties > Viewing and uncheck Show ... alpha transparent color. Restart and reload image and you see a face now. Then, load the other dds file. Works fine.
