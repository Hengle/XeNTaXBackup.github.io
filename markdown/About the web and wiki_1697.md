Thanks mate, we aim to please 

A short query on a related topic - is something a little unstable on the web server because many pages on the forum and wiki seem to be very slow, and about half of them time out

Ah good - I was wondering whether it was just me too  - guess not.

Hope it gets fixed soon!

Hmm, perhaps Captain knows, he's our webmaster. But I haven't really noticed anything myself.

Perhaps it might just be that the server is located in the US (I think?)? And if you yourself is located on the other side of the world, the peering to the server can be a little bad.

Actually, my ISP has mentioned today that they are having some lag when trying to connect to certain international websites - so thats probably the issue. Not sure what the problem is though, but it must be something kinda major because its been like this for 3 days and its one of our major ISPs.

Never mind mate - seems as though its not your fault

The server's located in Texas, USA (yeeehaw!). I haven't had any slow loading pages (and I live in the Netherlands) so it's probably some problem in some pipeline along the way.

Anyway, I don't think it's the server this time.
