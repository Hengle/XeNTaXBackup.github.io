Startup.upk(when i was repack) does not compress


Startup.upk(default size) = 51.3MB
Startup.upk(decompress size) = 148MB
Startup.upk(UPKrepack size) = 148MB

This is right. The package doesn't have to be compressed. Repack it and it must work.

Use this tool(upkpacker_v1.3.2), it repacks the package. No need for quickbms.
