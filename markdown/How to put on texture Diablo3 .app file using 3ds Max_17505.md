I tried several files in 3ds max, the files like chest or door single object is perfectly done. 

but multi object file like map( ex)a1dun_Leor_Jail_NSEW_01 ) is somethings wrong when I put on the texture.

texture name is  (a1dun_Leor_Jail_NSEW_01_scn_autoLM). 

Am I using wrong texture? or something else ?

Please help me and sorry for my English.
