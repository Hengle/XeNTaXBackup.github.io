If possible I would like to try unpack the files from the games .ifs files in order to do a self translation.
I think it's at least partially encrypted however even if I can just get a script that can extract and reimport the tables would be enough.

File example that contains the tables I need:
[https://mega.nz/#!olFnlZyI!KCIlLtsArzs7 ... 8FFmJu7RTc](https://mega.nz/#!olFnlZyI!KCIlLtsArzs7WUUdFx7vJg-p-nZtRGNIj8FFmJu7RTc)

File possibly linked to the archive creation?:
[https://mega.nz/#!Y89F2I7D!OdMHtUJi06wN ... 1UrTlmKu4E](https://mega.nz/#!Y89F2I7D!OdMHtUJi06wNmILZWr0n2sRwacExWXxwl1UrTlmKu4E)

You can see the tables by opening the file in UTF-8 and searching "begin of sheet".

Thanks to anyone willing to help with this.

That is an outdated script and no longer works unfortunetly:

Seems like someone has done it

I have used both patches from him, and they are buggy, seems he changed some code along with the translation itself.....
but I`m not sure if he is willing to give the script away.... asked twice on reddit already....

Well heard he's not giving it away and is trying to flog it off at $300
