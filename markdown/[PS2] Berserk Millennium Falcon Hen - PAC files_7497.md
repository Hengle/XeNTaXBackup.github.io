- Post Title: [PS2] Berserk: Millennium Falcon Hen - PAC files

Hi. I'm trying to get the models from this game, and there's someone who got one of the characters ripped, but there's no info on how he did it.

I've tried about every PAC unpacker there is for PS2 games, and it seems these PAC are not the same as any of the ones extracted by available software.

I've uploaded a sample (14 first mb of MODELS.PAC, which is where I suspect the models are in) here.

Thanks.

Hey, thanks for replying, and sorry for me replying so late. I had already tried that one. It only outputs empty folders (MODEL.dpac/MM/ and nothing in this directory).
