- Post Title: Help ripping models from POTBS(Pirates of the Burning Sea) .PIG files

hi everyone,

there were some old posts in this forum about ripping from pirates of the burning sea, some got answers, there wasnt any solution for extracting models. Someone said it was a very complex format no one would dare to unpack it... i dont know if its true. Well here is the 2020 post asking for a way to rip models from this game.

Example: [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LTPCMZ ... sp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LTPCMZsn20oesrSn9RUB_f7nt-8ntywF/view?usp=sharing) (ships.pig, where ship models are stored, 400mb)

Thanks for taking a look at it

btw this game has amazing ship models, i guess very few people are interested in old ships anyway


Edit: sorry, the file was on private, it should be downloadable now

I did find on the Net that the MultiEx Commander supports the .pig file.
I have downloaded / installed this program, but unfortunately I crashes on my Win10 64 bit OS.

Unfortunately multiex doesnt support that game, i wish it did, i wouldnt be posting here. I have only seen support for City of Heroes .pig files, which are (from what i've read) totally different than potbs pigs, same extension but different content (I dont know if they share anything to be honest). I dont know who wrote that on the wiki, maybe there was another version of multi which could open it, the current one at least doesnt support it

I think these files cant be decompressed

guys, i found out through the internet that the model format the pig files contains is .IGB, ive also learn that this format is very professionaly coded and nearly impossible to break through. But the good news is that there is an old tool from when intrinsic alchemy was available for purchasing(it was later purchased by vicarious visions, the guys who run potbs) which is basically the engine tool for viewing igb files. I dont know if this tool can view the igb files of potbs and i think no one has tried it but read this: I was able to open a test igb file that comes with the tool AND ninjarip it to blender from the viewer!!!!

Now, you might ask, why not ninjarip the game directly... well, its an online mmo and you have to get the ships to actually rip them... its a no no. Then you might think, well just get the ships and then rip them... also a no, this game is highly pay to play, there are certain ships(the most interesting ones) which are locked behind immense paywalls, so getting the ships to view the model ingame, impossible without spending literally 2k€.

Long story short, i think the pig file format is easy enough to decompress and i think the igb files can be viewed afterwars, pls give it a try
