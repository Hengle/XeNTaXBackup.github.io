- Post Title: Shadow of the Colossus - CTXR Texture files

So the file formats for the PS4 version of Shadow of the Colossus are (ctxr) for textures. Does anyone know how to make them viewable?

I have uploaded sample files right here in this Drive folder: [https://drive.google.com/open?id=1VcsjG ... b-p5F78P3L](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1VcsjGQ1ND_eEFmqvgOf-Dwb-p5F78P3L)

Hopefully someone can do something with them.
