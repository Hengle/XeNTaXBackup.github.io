- Post Title: Battlefield skeletons

Hi,

So I have been working and trying to figure out a way to import and build battlefield 3 skeletons using maxscript. So far I have one script that imports a mesh with bone indices, blend weights, uv`s, normals and tangents

and another script that reads skeleton file ,bone positions, bone names and hierarchy.

My problem is I can`t figure out a good way of how to put these two together. I tried using snippets from posts on this forum but with little to no joy. Could anyone with maxscript experience on this kindly assist me or at least point me in the right direction?

thank you

So I`ve figured out some more on the subject, but I`m still running into issues. I`ve made a short video to describe one of them.
