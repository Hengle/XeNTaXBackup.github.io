Pardon me, my age is none of your concern. Which part am I messing your topic? I was simply asking what is Tomb Rider? Since you wrote about it, surely you should be able to let us know. I tried to google it and no such game exists with that name for Xbox so yeah..............????

I never said anything about PC, i clearly said Xbox which is what you said, if you can't be bothered to read my posts fully then don't reply. I read yours quite well and tried to help well, if you're just not going to help yourself then why bother. Bye.

I didnt said Im looking for Xbox. I read the thread and saw those for xbox(maybe I understand wrong) Im looking for PC version... I know I made a mistake in the title but so what everybody understand except you clearly you wanted to argue which i dont want.. I have enough problems... So if you can help please help If u cannot then please leave me alone so maybe one person who like to help can help me through... I didnt want to be rude...
