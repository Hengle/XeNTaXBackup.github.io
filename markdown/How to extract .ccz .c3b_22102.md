- Post Title: How to extract .ccz .c3b

Hi im trying to extract and use models from an Android Game (Hogwarts Mystery) And i've only found the files .ccz .c3b 
Is there a way to extract these files?
I'm very new with 3d moddeling but I just wanted to play around with these specific models. 

Thanks!
