The textures are 8bit indexed pictured in raw format. i would need
more images to make comparisons between them in order to make
a converter somehow as both these are just fonts (japanese fonts). =)

The format itself is simply 8bit per pixel, and at the end
seems to be the palette data. however, i have not found anywere in the
header which says the resolution of the image or how many colors there is. when reading it through photoshop raw reader it looks good
with an X of 512. this is most probably a custom format, i have not seen it before =o

TIM2 is a standard PS2 image format - I think there are some specs around somewhere for it. Try searching for it on some general PS2 editing/modding websites, and I think there is a program on SourceForge that reads them or something.

The main info on TIM2 I found in some source code on the net - i think the program was called ezSwizzle. You can try goolging for the specific source code file tim2.cpp too if that helps.
