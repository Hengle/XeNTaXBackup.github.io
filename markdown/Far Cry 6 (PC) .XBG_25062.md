I been looking into some meshes to Far Cry 6 I was able to solve some of the characters but I cant seem to find uv data in some of these.

Not sure if it was the way they were stored in main files or if its some other issue here but this is what I found. No matter what i cant dial in these uv's.

No matter what padding padding/interval it just will not read right. I have tried every combination. 0/12 10/2 8/4 6/6 4/8 2/10 12/0 nothing works.

I did get close to the texture with this but its still far from correct.

I have spent almost 8 hours now looking into this issue. No dice. Any help? Or does anyone know what's going on here ? Data for characters was:

They come out nice but there was a little issue I noticed

Seems the meshes are not symmetrical.

Every mesh seems to have this 1 triangle in it

I checked many and it is always each mesh although the data is 100% correct.

Everything just seems broken or off.. I could really use some help here guys. Thank you in advance.

Seems the PC version is using Denuvo or something is wrong with the tool. Special thanks to id-daemon for helping me out. Files from the PS4 are good though, finally. I can sleep

Hey, just wondering what the ID was for Anton Castillo? Looking to port him but I can't figure out these file names and I am not sure if I haven't converted enough .fat files or if he isn't listed as anton.
