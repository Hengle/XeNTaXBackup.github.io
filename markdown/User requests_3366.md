- Post Title: User requests

Very often there are requests from users like:
"I can't unpack this file. Here is the head and the tail of it. Please help",
or:
"I need to unpack XYZ-files from the game ABC."

Often the users expect an instant solution which is only possible in very rare cases.

Reversing a file is often a very hard work!
To get information about the file (if the user has provided it), its original format and the game it belongs to requires additional hunting work for the reverser which isn't necessary to be made if the user would have provided information about the game and a download link to a demo or a full version, if available.
It is painful to ask a user for this information everytime afterwards.

Therefore I would take it advantageously to add following to the forum rules:

If a user wants to make a request, he should have to provide at least:
- A general information about the game, its developer(s) and publisher(s)
  (There are a lot of gaming sites like IGN, MOBYGAMES, 3DGAMERS... which hold this information)
- Working download links where an unprotected demo or a full version (or parts of it) can be downloaded without registration or any technical restrictions.

What do you think?

I agree. Now you know what I've had to deal with all these years. 

Some expect instant gratification! Which is not always possible, and nowadays it's even more difficult. It takes time. A lot of time. And not everyone realizes this, unfortunately. 

I'll add it.
