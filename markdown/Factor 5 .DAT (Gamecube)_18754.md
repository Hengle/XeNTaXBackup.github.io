- Post Title: Factor 5 .DAT? (Gamecube)

Hi! recently ive been trying to rip models from as the title implies, Rogue Squadron 2.
A Gamecube Star Wars title by Factor 5.

I found a quickBMS script to extract the .DAT files from the root of the "Rogue2" folder on the disc.



This worked like a charm and managed to get everything into that "Extract" folder.

Buuuuut there's more DAT files inside that the script won't work with.
Here's just one of said DAT files that won't work with the script.

You can find the script here.

If anyone can help out that would be greatly appreciated!

Most likely a raw image. Loading it into texture finder using RGBA8888 shows an outline of what looks like a texture:

Hm...
There has to be a model in there somewhere though. 
Or at least multiple textures.
