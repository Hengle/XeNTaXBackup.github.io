Hi, here one more finding
Gu Jian, huge (about 10gb) game with a lot of resources but it using gambryo 20.6.
The file are packed in ZPK, but they can be extracted with RPGViewer (But not all the versions of the rpg viewer has the option for this game), 
Here the option for this game (sorry i don't have chinese letters support in my system, so hieroglyphs are as squares)
 

Uh, it was a hard way to find how to extract archives (mainly because all the info was on chinese sites) and in the end it finds out that the game usinggamebryo 20.6, but maybe it will add motivation to someone to write some tool for this engine version.

Here is the game site

10 GB.

Lol, post samples. Preferably about a couple dozen of various types so people can look at what's available and then decide whether they want to get it or not.

But what is the point? It's Gamebryo 20.6 so there is no way to look at the models, all we can do is look at the textures.
Here examples of textures, the textures are really high quality. There also normal maps, so the game's models if it will be supported sometimes is really worth to look at.

Not sure what you mean. That could be said for any proprietary format that hasn't been reversed yet.

There is no way to look at the models if there are no models to work with. And most people probably aren't going to download 10 GB knowing that it's not supported anyways. I can't back-up 10 GB on a regular DVD   

If anyone wants to update the nif XML file it would be easy to add support to nifskope but I'm not interested in figuring out how the XML file works. Szkaradek already figured out the new structs anyways.

On the other hand, more samples would make it easier for me to write the noesis nif plugin since I can cross-reference multiple files using the same engine.
nif format is just a bunch of chunks and the team at niftools already has a good collection of docs.

No, i downloaded it from main site. It's really often chinese servers have very low speed but for exactly this game the download speed was normal. Maybe it depends on time? And night time (in China) speed is greater?

Actually szadarek...or what the name is  made a blender import for Catherine that is 20.6 but only works for that game. Maybe might work for this too though. I will check

correction: The blender script opens up the models, but cannot open animations. But its on a good way

Consider trying out different download tools.
I use thunder, and get 200-300 KB speeds, which is pretty standard for my connection type.

A lot faster than what chrome is giving me anyways.

Critical, are those models kind of 2D-flat? I've been having that problem with a lot of the newer games...

Not problems.
I just think it's weird that they're showing up as 2D.

Are the games actually 2D games or something?
It's making me think that I'm parsing them wrong.

Hmmm...what do you mean sying that the models are 2D-flat, how 3d model can be 2d? Or i something understand wrong (english is not my native language), the only thing that comes into my mind is models of plant's leaves that is usually planes with a texture and alpha opacity.

It's a 3D model, but all of the values for one of the axis are like 0 or something, so it just looks 2D. It's like projecting an object onto one of the planes.
At least, when you start rotating the model, it doesn't look like it's 3D or anything.

I'm looking at it in nifskope and it just looks stupid.

Hardly imagine that, bu think that something is wrong, can you show a screenshot? Because the game looks like real 3D in video [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5hlITLdu ... re=related](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5hlITLduzFs&feature=related)

Didn't look at this game in nifskope.
I confused this game with [viewtopic.php?f=10&t=8169](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=8169)

Basically in that game, I was using nifskope and it all looked 2D.

When I wrote the parser for this game, all of the vertices were showing the 2D-like models, which is wrong.

Training Courses that's good. Unfortunally in my town there's no such things as professional 3d teachings, if there is some, it's very, very basics. So trying to study by myself. Here some example of my own last work in modelling and animating (it's gif of prerendered sprite, that i made for modding old but still lovely Heroes Of Might And Magic 3

ahahaha very cute man, gratz , yes I get this problems before when trying make some curses, in my town is very small, so when move to city I do it, now I need back with something like this and programming too, I like everything about computers, so I admire many users here, and often one comes asking if things have made ​​contributions previously, including myself, but I do in a bad mood or anything, but recently I'm seeing is that it works with these things, in short, everyone has their reasons, if the only thing is that we were all rookies and will remain in all respects, because knowledge is something you never stop learning, always more and more things to discover, ok thank you very much everyone and take care.
