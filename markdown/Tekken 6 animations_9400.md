- Post Title: Tekken 6 animations

Hello everyone. I know how to get the Tekken 6 models from the X360 iso, but I don't know how to get to animations from it. I don't know whether this is feasible.   

It seems that the structure of the Tekken 6 animations is record the position and the shift of the bones. But how should I begin? I need some advices or directions.   

Thank you very much.
