- Post Title: Archlord DFF file

I am currently trying to open and view the DFF file from the Archlord world.
There are a lot of 12kb DFF files with a matrix like filename (eg XXX,XXX.ddf).

All know conversion scripts / plugins for eg. GTA and ZModeler result in a failed conversion.

Could someone be so kind to provide more insight and/or a way to properly read/edit these files?
