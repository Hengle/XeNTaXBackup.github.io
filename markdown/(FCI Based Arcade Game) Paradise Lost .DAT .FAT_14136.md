- Post Title: (FCI Based Arcade Game) Paradise Lost *.DAT *.FAT

Hello.

"Paradise Lost" - it is arcade game based on Far Cry Instincts. File structures is same that in original FC Instincts\Evolution games - FAT files, DAT archives (DAT2 Header).
But, exept *.FAT, this arcade port also included *.NFO files, which contains relative pathes for files in archives, and another informations:

Maybe it will be most helpfull for full-extracting game archives? Or modifying/addition for unique [Far Cry Evolution BMS script by Mr.Mouse](http://wiki.xentax.com/index.php?title=Far_Cry_Evolution_DAT)
