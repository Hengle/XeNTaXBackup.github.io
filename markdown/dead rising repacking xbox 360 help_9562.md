hey guys im trying to re import the files back in to the file but its seems harder then i thought  this is my problem
i load everything into re import no errors but no importing when i extract the files from the script  it extracts perfectly  but when it extracts it extracts the files in a folder  and im guessing the problem is the folder has to be re imported  with the files if anyone one knows how to do this please help

p.s when i try to select the folder and only opens it  to see the extracted files

i can give any files that are needed
