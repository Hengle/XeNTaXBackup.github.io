I've taken a look at the attached files to a limited degree of understanding. The file 'PL00.bd' is a cluster of playstation-ADPCM.
At first glance at all three files collectively - in addition to the particular way in which they've been named - I might've been mistaken into thinking they were csl\psf2 related ([http://www.neillcorlett.com/psf/](http://www.neillcorlett.com/psf/)), but alas they don't seem to be (at least, i hope I'm not mistaken here).
What's for certain is they these other two files are definitely audio sequencing charts for the '.bd' file (which contains the audio), but seemingly using a particular [game-independent?] formatting.
I'd be somewhat surprised though if nobody has yet reproduced these files somewhere on the net, in a playable format.
I assume these files are sound-effects or such, rather than music files? In any case; I've got this (very awesome) game somewhere, so I'll have a look at the disc a bit later this afternoon and get back to you if I find anything, or if no revelation is made by anyone else.
