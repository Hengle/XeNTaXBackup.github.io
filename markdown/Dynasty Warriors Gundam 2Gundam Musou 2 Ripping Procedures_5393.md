- Post Title: Dynasty Warriors Gundam 2/Gundam Musou 2 Ripping Procedures?

Hello there, I'm trying to rip the models/textures from Dynasty Warriors Gundam 2 (PAL Version) for the 360 and I've hit a snag every step of the way.

I've been working at this for a few days now, scouring the internet for advice and tools to do it and here's what I have so far.

I have the ISO unpacked and the files LINKDATA.ANS, LINKDATA.BNS, and LINKDATA.CNS, as well as the 360 system update, the .wmv movies and probably other stuff that I'm choosing to ignore, haha.

From what I understand, LINKDATA.CNS is where the models are located but I could have read that incorrectly.

I opened it with a hex editor and the only non-machine gibberish were the names of mobile suits, pilots etc.

I have quickbms ready with a script I found here (Looks like some of the same people I've seen here post there as well): [http://gameresearch.5d6d.com/archiver/t ... age-1.html](http://gameresearch.5d6d.com/archiver/tid-209-page-1.html)

Anyway, here's where I start failing. Quickbms exports files with no filetype and asks me to give each one a unique name, I have nooo idea why. I'm an artist, not a programmer, and my scripting knowledge goes as far as making a timer in Fallout 3 scripting (and I barely did that!) And after this point I have no idea what I'm supposed to do with these seemingly random chunks of data.

The internet trail-of-truth for how to do this went cold on that forum where it looks like people figured it out but didn't share their full process so I guess that's what I'm asking for now, haha. Thank you to anyone who can help me!

PS: This is also my first post and I'd just like to say thank you for allowing me to join this prestigious community. Finding this forum was like finding the holy grail of interesting stuff!

Ah yeah, I saw your post. It seems the secret methods used by the Chinese developers are closely guarded, looks like you got further than i did though, good luck to us both...

It should be an almost identical if not the same as fist of the north star did you try noeisis on the extracted bin files.

I never got to the extracted bin files point. I have the .ANS, .BNS and .CNS files and I could never find a good description on how to extract the bin files.

Oh, haha, I'm no programmer, no clue what i'm doing in the reverse engineering field. i'm a 3d artist and i'm interested in the models for a hobby project, that's all. i thought it was already possible to rip them, my mistake
