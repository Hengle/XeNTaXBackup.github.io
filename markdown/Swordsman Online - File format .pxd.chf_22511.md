- Post Title: Swordsman Online - File format .pxd/.chf

Hey guys 

Are any of you familiar with the following file extensions? .pxd/.chf
Does someone of you know how to import .pxd/.chf file extensions in 3d programs like 3ds Max?
I have successfully unpacked the game Swordsman Online including the buildings folder (buildings.pck) and I received the following files.
File formats: pxd & .chf
The files are output files if you unpack the folder "building.pck" from Swordsman Online.
You can see some of the files I've unpacked.

I would be so glad if we can find an solution to this problem.

Hi Raylee .
 I suggest you to contact Karpati, the owner of 3d obj converter and active member in xentax, his program support a lot of format and maybe he could add support .
