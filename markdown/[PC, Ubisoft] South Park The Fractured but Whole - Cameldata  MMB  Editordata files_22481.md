- Post Title: [PC, Ubisoft] South Park: The Fractured but Whole - Cameldata / MMB / Editordata files

Hi guys,

I'm trying to rip whatever sprite data I can from South Park: The Fractured but Whole. Using quickbms and a script I found on a similar forum, I managed to extract files from the SDF files - namely CAMELDATA, EDITORDATA and MMB files.

At this point, though, I'm stumped. I've googled around, but have only found a py script for The Division, and I don't know nearly enough about python to run it, let alone edit it.

I don't even know for sure any sprite data is even in these files, but they seem a good place to look.

Any help would be greatly appreciated!

Attach some samples, please.

Btw, you can rip some images directly from memory
using NinjaRipper or TexMod.

It won't let me attach, but here are all 3 filetypes from the screenshot upped to Mediafire. If you want them uploaded somewhere else instead just lemme know. 

I'll look into trying those two tools too, thanks.
