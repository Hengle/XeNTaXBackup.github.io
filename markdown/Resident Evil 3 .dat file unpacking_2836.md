- Post Title: Resident Evil 3 .dat file unpacking

Hi. I installed Resident Evil 3 Demo, and there are many .dat files in the folder.

[One of them is here. (1.90 MB)](http://rapidshare.com/files/65327967/rofs14.dat.html)

If you open it with notepad, you will see the following codes at the beginning. After that are a lot of strange codes.

```

      rj  M101A010.WAV    z€  M101A020.WAV  "  z€  M101A030.WAV  3  z  M101A040.WAV  P  ? M101A050.WAV  r  z€  M101A060.WAV    ?

......

```


How do we get the .wav files?

You can find an extractor here:
