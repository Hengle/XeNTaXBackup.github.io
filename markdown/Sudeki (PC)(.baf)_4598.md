Did anyone ever write an extractor for this game? If not this one is easy so I might whip up one. It has weird noninterleaved vertex format but doable.

As far as I know, extractor never existed. If you can create one, it will be great.

I worked on this game last year; extracting level geometry was easy, but there was no UVs. After level geometry was some data that was difficult to parse, making it difficult to get to the character models so I gave up. Models could be hardcoded out of the container however, as I remember extracting some skeleton characters.

Well, I'm only interested in extract the models. Is that possible without using 3dripper??
