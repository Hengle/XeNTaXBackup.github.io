Hi All,

With the help of this site and another I've been trying to extract the audio files from the new MMO Wildstar from Carbine on PC

They use a combination of WEM & BNK files (similar to SWTOR) so I've been using those instructions to convert from BNK>WEM>OGG with little to no success.
I keep getting invalid chunk size error when doing the final part of the conversion  WEM>OGG from BNK

Some files are already in WEM format and when converting these to OGG they have all been successfull.

To extract the files I use a program called Wildstar Studio found here - [https://bitbucket.org/mugadr_m/wildstar ... uncher.exe](https://bitbucket.org/mugadr_m/wildstar-studio/downloads/Launcher.exe)

This give you access the to the client data file and then you can view everything (GFX/Audio etc.)

I was wondering if anybody was able to look into this (if you had the time) and see if some extra knowledge or programs are required for the conversion.

Thanks for looking,

iFrak

I don't have the game or the space to install it, but keep in mind, there's two sets of codebooks for wwise oggs, and it could also be wwise adpcm, inwhich case, hcs has another tool called imarejigger.

edit: this wildstar studio tool is neato. seems to let me download specific bits?

Hi,

Thanks for the update, WS studio is a very useful tool. I will have a look for this program you mentioned.

Again thanks

Sorry for lack of updates/replies.

I found the following program Riveal - [http://rshayter.net/Riveal/](http://rshayter.net/Riveal/) which converts the BNK audio from Wildstar to wav with no issues or distortion.

And for the wem>ogg convertion I do the batch convert which I found on these forums also.

Thanks for all advice and help

I too have been trying to grab audio from Wildstar and used the methods here (and on another site) to grab about 7 gigs worth of audio.  But after going through all of it, I've got a lot of ambient noise, a lot of sound effects, a crapton of music, but only one or two snippets of the spoken dialog.  Things like level up sounds, NPC expositions, and cinematic voice-overs are missing.  Has anyone else come across any of this stuff?  If so, can you point me in the right direction?

I found them!! all 26,433 files   

They are located in the following location ClientDataEN.index. Under the Audio folder they are the .WEM files.

Once converted to OGG size is around 1.03GB

Have fun with them
