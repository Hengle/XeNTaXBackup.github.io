Don't tknow what are those codes, but maybe you should get this game in other language versions, look up those files and get what you want?

I don't really understand ... I got the language codes from all the game's language files.  The other languages ​​are implemented in exe, but they don't have their own files, hence I don't know what the codes will be in the language file.  And to create it I need this code.

It doesn't work like that. To change text for other languages, you probably need to replace already existing files.

This isn't the point.  I have added dialogues.  It's just about locals.bin.  The whole menu is in it, etc. It is in the file eg bigfile_RUSSIAN.000.tiger When unpacking, locals.bin goes to the folder whose name is also the language code, and each language has a different name, according to what I wrote in the first post.  Unfortunately, without knowing a few HEX values, which are the language code, you won't be able to add a new language file to the game.
