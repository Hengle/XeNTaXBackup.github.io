- Post Title: Harry Potter for Kinect (Xbox 360) Textures

Another xbox 360 format I am having trouble with. I couldn't get any promising preview with the standard tools. Some parts of the data looks like it is DXT, but I still couldn't get it to load.

Two shorts at 0x28 for width and height probably. Image data seems to starts at 0x1000. I have attached the samples. I hope someone can take a look. Thank you.

How did you get the textures out of the .000 files?
