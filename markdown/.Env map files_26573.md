- Post Title: .Env map files??

Hello, there is an older game called motocross madness 2 that use .env files for the maps which included the height map, sky box and other things. Is it possible to extract any of those files from the .env file? Or while it's running in game?
The files were compiled in the game's map editor called Armadillo.

Thanks
