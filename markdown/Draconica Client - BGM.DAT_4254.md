File index table is encrypted, files can be encrypted on a per-file basis, you're pretty lucky they went with unencrypted data for the music.

Actually the music is indeed unencrypted so maybe we're lucky and the rest is unencrypted too. Is there a possibility to decrypt the file table? Maybe with the help of the executable or a dll?
