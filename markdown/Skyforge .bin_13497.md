Hi

Files like "Skyforge_Characters\Female\Skins\Armors\Robot\Base.Skin-Geometry.bin" have only mesh data.
No info about submeshes, lods, vertex stride,  only vertexdata size and indicedata size.
Vertex position is as floats from 3 x 2bytes (3 shorts).


Files like "Skyforge_Characters\Female\Skins\Armors\Robot\Base-MaterialLayer.bin" have image data.

Yes, .bin from character's folder stores only raw mesh/image data inside. There's a big files which stores all information about any object in the game - mesh/textures/skeleton it's about ~270-280mb in size. I have script for model import, but it's in "beta" stage, though it's importing most of player models (maybe vehicles too or weapons)

Szkaradek123 , How did you get 3-floats from 3-shorts ?
3-shorts are 3-half ( floats ) ?

I can, but script is in very early stage  You will get character models (not all of them) and that's all, and no rig! Should finish it, at least with rig support, after I will end with other game I'm working on now

thanks for the model shakotay2

not sure if people are still trying to extract assets form Skyforge but i have managed to extract some textures.



Are people still interested in reverse engineering this game? they made one of the most optimized and good looking game engines i've ever seen. their textures are a little bit unusual.

i documented my findings about the textures here [viewtopic.php?f=18&t=12828&p=121865#p121865](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=18&t=12828&p=121865#p121865) if anyone's intetested

all the materiallayer.bin files are packed textures. as Ace said his plugin for noesis opens geometry.bin files. if you're missing the geometry.bin file then something might have went wrong during the unpacking process. for which armor are you missing the geometry.bin file?

the problem with these model files has always been there is no header, just the total buffer sizes for vertex block and indices are stored.
your sample has face indices that reset to "00 00" five times, could be LODs or accessories, i didn't check.
that reset in the indices is the only indication there may be submeshes, so changing the script to make 
it work for this sample could break it for others because detecting this "reset" may not be reliable.

there is no fixing, the files lack a header and there is no way to tell what the format or 
dimensions are, the only factor to work from is the size of each mip which is not reliable.   
unless someone locates files in the game containing the headers there is nothing more i can do, sorry.   
you can always use TextureFinder or Rawtex to get the images in a usable state.

the "fix" comes when you guys that have the game find the files that store the header info
for the mesh and texture files so they can be read properly. your sample has submeshes but
can't be read in a single array because the indices run together, i could cobble up something
to attempt locating the indices start of each submesh but that isn't reliable, i'd rather do it right.

3rd submesh wrong, in hex2obj, too:

As Ace mentioned there's a problem with some submeshes; the pointclouds are ok, the face indices seem to be ok, too
but somehow they don't fit together. (Guess the v addresses have to be changed to higher ones.)

maybe we should ask Zaramot for the name of it; there's many paks, and I couldn't seem to find something promising

anyways, the FVF from this witches' Base.Skin-Geometry has an FVF of 28 instead of 24:

there are also models with FVF of 16 and 20. usually weapon models. i've extracted most of the models form Skyforge and saved .h2o files for most of them. so let me know if you need a h2o for a particular model.

But I think we need an overall solution that would require the above mentioned "big (parameter) file".

As for the above model which I called "bikini girl". Did you get the H2O files and if so did you get them one by one (which I found to be very tedious, 4 copies of "cloth set", 3 copies of shoes) or do you have some method which we could transform into code? For me it was a time eating trial 'til I found it were 4 "cloth sets" and 3 pairs of shoes for example.

- Post Title: Re: Skyforge .bin

I decided to take a look at the bikini girl and I was able to get the meshes without a problem.



My approach is similar to shakotay's, the only difference being the calculation of the vertex data offset of the following mesh.

It seems like every index block start with "0000 0100 0200". So find the positions of this pattern, read until you find the next occurrence, and for the last one read until the end of the file. This basically gets you the indices of each mesh.

After that I printed out the maximum values of index list to get an idea of the vertex counts. It came up like this :



The vertex data starts almost immediately at offset 0x8, and the integer value before that (at 0x4), is the size of this data. For the bikini girl this value is 858240. We divide that by the total vertex count, and we get 858240 / 11920 = 72.

Still the vertex block size for a single vertex is not 72 bytes, it is 24 bytes as you can see from shakotay's h2o screenshots. Instead for each mesh there are 3 times (24 bytes blocks * vertex count), 2 of them appears to be LODs.

In my code I read 24 * vertex count, but for calculating the vertex data offset of the next mesh, I do 72 * vertex count. It seems right for the bikini girl model. I haven't checked other files, but if every mesh has exactly 3 copies, it would be possible to find the vertex block size with :
vertex data size (at 0x4) / total vertex count / 3.

Here is my code. Some methods are not in the code, but you get the main idea. I commented what the method does.

```

Great!

But for the "cloth set" I found 4 meshes, so I guess the first one at 0x1F3E8 to be ignored when analysing?

I would say yes. I am getting the first 2 meshes like this. First one is full body with clothes, and second one is just clothes.



So the first block :

is actually part of the full body, but it seems to work fine with the indices of the second index list too. Full body mesh seems to be put together from the vertices of other meshes in the file, and I guess you found the part related to cloth vertices, inside the full body vertices.

Btw this seems like an inefficient way to store model data to me. They are repeating lots of vertex blocks.

well, yes, inefficient, lol.
I updated the code of my Make_obj - project. It was so simple, but I still don't understand about the 4 "cloth meshes". I also don't understand why I get 3 bodies.  

Have to think about it when I have some spare time.

btw: nice to have someone like you here, akaderebur! Kudos.

I am not sure why there are 3 bodies either, but the last one seems to have no straps for bikini. So maybe different variations of the same bikini, with small differences.

Thanks, I am flattered  I see you (and AceWell too) on the forums daily, helping people with almost every game. I just give a hand, when/if I can find out something.

(sorry for the misspelling of your nick, akderebur, seems I was thinking of "academic" which is spelled "akademisch" in german.)

well, seems I somehow grasped the "fourth" bikini from the body (starting at 0x0008).

This is the result for the Geometry.bin uploaded by lxxxk:

my take on it is that the 3 bodies are there for the body sliders that are in the game. so there is a Skinny, Athletic and Thicc body for every character model. the game just morphs between these 3 bodies when you change the sliders.

i'm still waiting for someone to upload this "big file", it supposedly contains all the secrets.

I had to compress the files in order to be able to upload them.

The only big file I could find is 389MB:
https://www.mediafire.com/file/k68q7a84eb1urno/xdbPack.7z

Not sure but I think this file has something in it. Towards the bottom it lists Geometry.bin, MaterialLayer.bin, and the animation bins:

Did either of the files provide the information you need to get the models and textures to working correctly?

during extraction so that everything is cross referenced precisely.
maybe someone who has all the files can see something i don't.

Okay. I'm wondering if toc.developer is an index on how to unpack the pak files. An other file labeled links.temp.bin.index seems to have a few things in common with toc.developer. In both files it seems to point that the outputted file should be like Visual/Characters/Male/Skins/Armors/Football/Base.Skin-Geometry.bin.zip.

Edit: I'm looking at some other files also that are outside of the pak files one says something about triangulation and texcoord.

@ethanej: if you're really interested in "the big file" you should ask zaramot for its name. (Kinda funny that this isn't known since Sun Nov 22, 2015 12:55 pm now  )

If anyone ever managed to find suiting textures for a model I'd start from finding the belonging names in files rather than doing a blind search.

For the file list in toc.developer, you need to count the files, then try to make sense of the index table.

The only big file from the pak files that I ever found was the xdbpack file that I posted a few weeks ago. I even searched the base directory where it splits files for the installer and game.

But there's Visual/Interface/Icons/Equipment/Weapons/BardWeapon_01.tga.bin.zip for example.
Maybe you could unpack the tgas contained (?) and search for the suiting weapon which should not be too hard?

thanks! i see a lot of interesting files there, i guess i'll have to download the game to check many of them though.  

can you upload "toc" from here

Hello, have you by chance been able to obtain the mounts and weapons of this game with their respective textures? Or can you tell me if it is possible? , I don't have much free space on my disk so I wanted to know that before trying to download the game. Thanks in advance.

For Base01-Geometry.bin you're better off to use hex2obj (since there's face indices blocks that don't start with 000001000200 which the Make_obj Skyforge version relies on).

heres a Noesis python script to open your sample  
tex_Skyforge_MaterialLayer_bin.zip
supports dxt5 and is set to display all mips   
if some textures appear invisible just press F11 to disable viewport transparency while viewing.
Hello! someone could point me how to modify this script to can open some textures that are 512*1024 and others that are this format RGBA= RGB + ALPHA (8888 = 24 + 8 ). Any kind of advices would be great!

Good Afternoon,
I got recently interested in extracting some buildings with their textures from Skyforge, but from what I can gather the files are in .pak format, unless I'm looking at the wrong place as the comments here trying to give me indications appear out of time.

Using the resulting Make_obj.exe as of May 2018 this is the raw result for the base.skin-geometry.bin you've uploaded.
Feel free to expand above linked source to gain a better result.

I don't suppose that anyone have made progress in deciphering the big xdbPack.inplace file? The headers for model files are in it, i was able to find vertex\triangle counts for submeshes inside, skeletons seem to be in there as well, but i can't figure out it's structure, at least not the chunk which contains the headers (~ the first 256 mb). Has anyone looked at it?
