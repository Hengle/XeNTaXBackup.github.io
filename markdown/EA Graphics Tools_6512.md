Hey guys,

I've recently come across Mr. Mouse's EA Graphics Tool, which is an amazing application! I've been messing around with EA's SSH files for ages and never had any success. However, when I attempt to open an ssh file with EA Graphics Tool, I get the "Runtime Error 9: Subscript out of range".

I'm using Windows 7 x64; has anyone else experienced this problem. Moreover, does anyone know a solution?

I appreciate any input or insight tremendously; cheers!

SM
