I tried to decrypt the mails using a script PcarsTools, but it doesn't work. It doesn't seem to work. Although there are rumors that the script can decrypt them. Has anyone managed to do this?

Unhandled exception. System.UnauthorizedAccessException: Access to the path 'D:\3D' is denied.Is "3D Temp" a folder that you've created? If so rename it to "3D_temp" or similar, without blanks.
(Just a wild guess, btw.)

@MichaelBFS just wrap the input path in quotes.
In your case, the full commandline arguments will be:

```
PCarsTools_x64.exe decryptmodel -i "D:\3D Temp\C3Int\00ba6050.meb"
```

Thanks a lot! It seems to work!
You have to extract and import one object at a time, it takes time, but it works.
