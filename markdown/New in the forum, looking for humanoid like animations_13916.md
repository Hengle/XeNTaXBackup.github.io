Hi all

I'm happy to be part of the community

I'm looking for forms to extract humanoid animation from 3D games, I would like to know where I should start.

Should I try games from a specific engines: Havok, Unreal etc?

I mostly trying to study get them exported to .BVH file so I would have some fun in blender by retargeting my host armature.

any tips are very much welcome thanks

I have no idea what you want to achive, espicially with Blender (   )

But you could dive into Torchlight 2, they have officially all of their models available in Max
