Here is a sample of the 3 different compression or format. [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1khEGmY ... 9OcjK/view](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1khEGmY53Jq2iOT_9Az8wOeZlCJ49OcjK/view) First one works perfectly in noesis, 2nd one needs to be edited in Hex Editor (delete everything before BRES) or Unzipped, and 3rd one doesn't open even with Hex Editor or being Unzipped with anything and if it does, pieces of the mesh is missing. Hopefully someone can be able to extract these models with bones cause theres over 200+ spiderman models.

Also there is a program called Unwrap 3d Pro which costs $60usd which is $420 of my currency but it does not export with all bones. It only exports the root bone which is the bone that moves the entire model. It does not have bones that controls arms, head, thighs etc.

You should be more clear which one is the "first" sample and which one is the "third".
Assuming Mesh_2099_New being the last here's the mesh:
