I'm looking for someone with the enough skills to create a 3D extractor/importer tool for the game Kinnikuman (Ultimate Muscle) Muscle Grand Prix

So far I have identify the vertices of the game, but can't import ones from foreigner 3D models.

I willing to pay $200 through Paypal for the one that can make a importer and exporter tool possible.

**Taken**

Name the game. If you're worried about someone following this request back to whatever community you popped out of, you don't deserve to be making the request.

Any idea what Game Engine this uses?
A place to download some of the content?
I'm not after the game.. just the model files and any related data(skins/normal maps).
May want to PM me with a address where I can get at these files.
It's a very bad idea to publicly post links to copyrighted material.

I'm making headway on this project 
There is still much to be done.
So far all I can do is load.
Next will be texture mapping and than I'll start on the import/export code.
