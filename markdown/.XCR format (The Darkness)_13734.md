- Post Title: *.XCR format (The Darkness)

Hi guys! Need to extract (and after insert translated text) the text from files *.XCR. (game The Darkness for PS3)
Maybe someone can write a script or packer\unpacker?

Try this QuickBMS script:

[viewtopic.php?p=68579#p68579](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?p=68579#p68579)

It shares the same magic header "MOS DATAFILE2.0" which is fairly unique

It work only xcd files (In addition, it is difficult to edit these files). In .xcr files structure is little different.
For *.xcd I have a script in Python with a normal text extraction (view screenshot), made one good man. With .xcr format he could not understand. 
Left to deal with the *.xcr files.

If anyone can make packer\unpacker (or script) for the money, write to the PM.
