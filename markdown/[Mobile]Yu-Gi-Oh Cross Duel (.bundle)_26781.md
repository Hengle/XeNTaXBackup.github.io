Hi everyone!
I have tried to rip this mobile game with existed tools but I still failed to extract the model with correct uv mapping.
I could figure the 3d assets by guessing the random *.bundle file by using UABEA and extract the model by using UABE.
But the problem was that the mapping was not correct after using UABE. Maybe the plugin was something wrong. The situation was below:

Hence, I want to know if there is better way to extract it normally.
The sample was below:

i have tested your sample and looks like you need to use assetstudio, but you need to put the version of the bundle in the specify unity version option, for me the uv's worked perfectly, my guess is that the cause of this is uabe doesn't export uvs correctly with meshes
