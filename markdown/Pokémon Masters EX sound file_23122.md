Hello, i have one file from Pokémon Masters EX (mobile game) 
and i don't know how to decrypt these file

all game file are on this MEGA link : [https://mega.nz/folder/kM0jhKrD#xC2ECBZfCizY0TjgtFC5bA](https://mega.nz/folder/kM0jhKrD#xC2ECBZfCizY0TjgtFC5bA)
i think to decrypt file, we search on lib (.so) files but i'm not sure.
