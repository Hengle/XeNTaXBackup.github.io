For music and sounds you can use PSound - they are in PACK_IOP.PAK, however for models, its not possible yet, maybe soon.

It does, you only have to select files and save them, as for messed up sounds, play around with Sample Rate in Configuration. As there isnt another alternative so far, I have used PSound on both TG and TGBM and it worked flawless. Maybe if you are doing something wrong, I could help you out.

PS
I forgot to mention I successfully ripped some textures, but models appear screwed up so far, maybe when PCSX2 has more improvements in GSDX plugin in future we could be getting models easier.
