Hello People. I'm Nick from Playrise Digital - makers of TTR - what is it you are trying to do? What do you need? I might be able to help...but don't go off trying to make a new version of the game please.

Sadly I'm not a programmer so I can't help you on that side. What the purpose? If someone wants to rebuild the game I've actually got a job for someone. We've not been on the Apple store for a while because its an old build pipeline and built with VS2012 and so we need to find someone who can upgrade the game to 64-bit so we can get it back on the Apple store. Had a few people try - but if there's an expert out there that might be able to help - I'd be happy to entertain it. If you're in the business - contact me on [admin@playrise.co.uk](mailto:admin@playrise.co.uk)

Can you tell me how did you the the .amodel files?

I have installed the Table Top Racing World Tour game and I have got the following archive files:
    resources.assets
    sharedassets0.assets ... sharedassets8.assets 

I have unpacked these files using the UnityEX v1.8.9.4 (by DragonZH) and I have got *.mesh model files only.

World Tour is the "sequel" to TTR. We're looking to get the files from the original.

it's time to do it yourself!

plugin Noesis for Table Top Racing(TTR)
opens model (*.amodel)
unpack PKM texture as .ktx2 (open with PVRTexTool)

for batch processing you can create .bat in "..\\PVRTexTool\CLI\Windows_x86_64",
and replace "C:\YourPath\*.ktx2".
after that you can delete all *.ktx2 and *.pvr through the search.
(searches for files also in subdirectories)

```
setlocal enabledelayedexpansion
for /f "delims=" %%a in ('dir /b /s /a-d "C:\YourPath\*.ktx2"') do (
PVRTexToolCLI.exe -i %%~a -d -f r8g8b8a8 )
pause
```

(the plugin looks for a texture near the file with the prefix "_Out", because after batch processing this prefix is ​​added automatically)
name.ktx >> name_Out.png

I have finished my Table Top Racing *.AMODEL load module.

It extracts the .pkm texture files from the .amodel files automatically after load.


I have released the following program:
- 3D Object Converter v10.001 (Windows)

How to get the 3D Object Converter v10.001:
Download the 3D Object Converter from [ http://3doc.i3dconverter.com](http://3doc.i3dconverter.com) and install it or download and use the portable version (if you don’t have it yet).
(Or just use the Help/Check for updates... function to get the v10.001.)
