- Post Title: Xian Mei from Dead Island

I've looked every where for a ripped version of Xian Mei in T-pose and so far things seem pretty vague. I've only seen a few posts saying its possible using gameassassin, but I tried it myself and I just don't understand how the programme works. When I try running Dead Island thru it, it just exits itself. I was wondering if anyone has been able to get her and her textures? I'd very much so appreciate it!!

Wasn't there a dead island thread somewhere around here. Maybe they got somewhere.

rick did an unpacker, but you have to compile the C# yourself. no model extractor yet as far as I know.

I don't use blender, but I've been trying to get python26 to work, but I dunno how to install it. Is it possible to send me a link of xian as an .obj or something?
