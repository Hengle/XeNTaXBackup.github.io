- Post Title: Dead Space .STR compressed file

Well, i'm from Brazil and i'm trying to translate the xbox 360 version of this game.

In the 360 iso there were 2 files, bigfile0 and bigfile1, i've created a tool to unpack this file format but now i'm stuck coz this str compressed format is beyond my knowledge.

Can anyone help me?

Thanks.

You want the tool? yep, let me just compile it, i'm having a little problem when it comes to unpack the last file, not giving me the rigth size.

And let me finish the gui.

Do you know how to decompress the text file i posted??

So i'm guessing we never will get that STR extractor   ...anyone else know where to find it (or similar) extractor for the Dead Space STR files?

The main reason i'm looking for a extractor is so i can see if the alarm used during quarantine aboard the Ishimura is stored in one of the STR files...i have already tried all the SNU files in the audiostreams folder.
