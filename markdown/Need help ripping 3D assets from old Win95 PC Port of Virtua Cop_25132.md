Hello! 

So, I've been trying to rip some game assets from a Windows 95 PC port from an old game: "VIRTUA COP", an on-rail game originally released in arcades and eventually ported towards the Sega Saturn. 

Unfortunately, I couldn't rip anything from the game (I used Ninja Ripper 2.0.8 beta and 3D Ripper DX) and so far no results - no mesh or textures exported. I uploaded my VCOP folder from my C drive to my Google Drive and created a link from there. 

Here's the link:

My goal here is to rip the 3D models, meshes, texture maps, shaders, UV maps, and basically the entire scene layout from Stage 3: Gang HQ. This also includes the building interiors & exteriors as well as the aforementioned models, meshes, textures, etc. The reason is so that I can create a unique variant of an album cover for one of my many music projects on Bandcamp for the vaporwave community.

And yes, before you ask, I'm a musician. As well as an artist. ^u^

Any help is appreciated! Thanks!!!
