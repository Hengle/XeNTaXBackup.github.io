- Post Title: Extract .RBB sound files from Way of the Samurai PS2

Hello and good day,

I'm trying to find the music files from the Way of the Samurai PS2 game, and I unarchived the .bin file, and in a folder called SOUND, it shows a file called GZMVS.RBB which I assume will contain the music files, but I don't know how to extract the .rbb file.

Anyone know of a way to do this, please?

Thank you kindly!
