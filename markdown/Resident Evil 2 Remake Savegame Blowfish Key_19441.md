- Post Title: Resident Evil 2 Remake Savegame Blowfish Key

I've been reversing the Resident Evil 2 remake's save encryption method and I honestly have no idea what I'm doing because the game clearly implements a scripting engine that I know nothing about. Has anyone worked on this because I can't find anything on Google about it.

Where did you manage to find that? Is it inside a script in the PAK files or is it inside the binary?
