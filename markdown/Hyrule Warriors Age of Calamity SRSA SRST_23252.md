From what I'm told by a buddy, these are the audio archives in the game.

I'm interested in getting the sound effects specifically - voice clips, fight sounds, etc.

I presume SRST is music, since he described it as "(S)?(R)esource(S)ound(T)rack and (S)?(R)esourse(S)ound(A)rchive. I'm told that perhaps the clips are in adpcm format. I realize the game has no filenames for now for most resources, but that won't hamper me.

Should I upload samples of both archive, or have these been cracked because I didn't see a thread?

Thanks.

Samples of each:

I posted this on Discord earlier:

For the .srsa file - delete the first 16 bytes, and save as a new file with the extension .ktsl2asbin.  For the .srst file, delete up to the "KTSS" header and save as a new file with the extension .kns - both will then play in Foobar with vgmstream.

Also on the Discord, Joschka has posted a couple of QuickBMS scripts to automate the process, if you want to grab them from there.

EDIT: You might be the same person who originally asked on Discord - if so, then ignore this
