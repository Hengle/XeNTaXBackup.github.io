- Post Title: Porting models from The Urbz to The Sims 2 (PS2)?

I was wondering if models could be ported from The Urbz to The Sims 2 for PS2? I used a QuickBMS script made by aluigi in order to extract and repack the ARC files the game has, but the issue is it seems the model format is just slightly different since the model is invisible after repacking and rebuilding the ISO. If anyone has any insight on this, please reply.

Model file for The Urbz:
