- Post Title: MapleStory (Latest version)

Does anyone know how to set up the latest version of a MapleStory private server? It has to be at least v205 or higher as it's the version that has the Eternal gear and all the latest... everything - including limited time quest/event items. I can imagine what it would be like to combine the Eternal gear with the Wizet Invincible Hat.
