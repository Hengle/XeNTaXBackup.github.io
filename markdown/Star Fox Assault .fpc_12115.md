I don't know how to open the *.fpc files in this game. I think it's where the voice files are, which I'm trying to replace.

Any luck with 3D Model extraction? Any chance of a sample you could post (Could be interesting)?

I don't know where the models are stored, but I know these *.fpc files at least have voice acting and some graphics. It also loads a small *.fpc during pre-rendered cutscenes, maybe for subtitles?
