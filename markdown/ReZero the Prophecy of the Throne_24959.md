Hello, so I managed to extract the cfsi with this tool
[https://zenhax.com/viewtopic.php?t=2697](https://zenhax.com/viewtopic.php?t=2697)
Got some textures in DDS and models in .std.orb
tried using the std blender importer but doesnt work
There doesnt seem to have many documents of this format either
Would appreciate for any help, thanks.

There were solutions on Zenhax:
[https://zenhax.com/viewtopic.php?p=14930#p14930](https://zenhax.com/viewtopic.php?p=14930#p14930)
and from Szkaradek123
so there's no need to restart a request, imho.

the model format is std.orb, removed the orb extention. I guess they are different after all
Gonna give the hex method a shot.
