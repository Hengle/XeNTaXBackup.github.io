- Post Title: Decompile Dynasty warrior game

Hey yall,
Ive had some luck with this forums before, and I really want to Mod one of the older DW games (3 or 4) for myself. I was wondering if anyone out there would be willing to tackle the very huge task of decompiling this game and trying to have at a working version of the source code. I'm told by some people this is possible in 2-4 months costing more money than im willing to spend, and im told by others its impossible. Since this webpage appears to really specialize in this type of thing, I was wondering if there are any experts on the matter here, that could lend some advice or maybe I could hire to help me.

I intend to keep this 100% legal to the best of my knowledge it is not illegal if nothing is redistributed? just want to make a mod for myself.
Thanks for your time.
