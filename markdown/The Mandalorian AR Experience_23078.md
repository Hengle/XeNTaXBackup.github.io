Contains a fairly decent looking Mandalorian model (and should be getting new models each week) and it runs on Unity, the only problem is that it seems that the Mandalorian model and whatever else may be coming later in the app is downloaded through the app itself as they don't seem to be inside of the Unity files. Any chance someone could figure out how to get the in game content?

Got a little progress with models, still it's kinda strange looking upon exporting: 
Dunno why it exports only part of model as pic above and all other parts as meshes with no rigging

Just AssetStudio, I asked one guy to install android apk so it would load AR scenes with models inside, and then just extracted it as usual, now only rigging is left

Any chance the scene resources could be posted? That's the one thing I've had trouble getting out of the game so far since I can't get BlueStacks to run it.

Can you PM me the files as well?
I can't run the app to extract them myself, and i want to take a look at the files.
Regards!
