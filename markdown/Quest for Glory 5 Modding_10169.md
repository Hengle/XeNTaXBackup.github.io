- Post Title: Quest for Glory 5 Modding

Hey all,

Myself and a couple of others have made some progress with modding Quest for Glory 5, and old adventure game by Sierra.

We have managed to develop a program to export and import textures from the game and are working on exporting the 3d mesh data. I am posting this here in the hopes that it will drum up some more interest and help with our efforts.


Progress on my 2x resolution Hero skin =]
