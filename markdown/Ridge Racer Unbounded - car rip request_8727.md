- Post Title: Ridge Racer Unbounded - car rip request

Hi, I am in great need of the following car found in the limited edition of Ridge Racer Unbounded.


I hope you guys can tell me how to go about it... I tried DX ripper but only the wheels are visible.
Printscreen 3D just crashes the game.

Member XpoZed was able to extract the files in another thread... I zipped a few car folders here.

Here is a savedgame file to unlock all cars in the game.
