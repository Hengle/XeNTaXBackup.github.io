Can somebody help? I have some audio samples from Ubisoft's Just Dance series. I need them to be converted. Anybody know a solution?

hi,

it's only a 8 bit interleaved dsp format.
here is a quick implementation onto vgmstream for winamp

tell me if these one works for you or provide some that doesn't.

cheers
