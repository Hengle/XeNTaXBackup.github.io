It looks like that the models are viewable and extractble.

The AES key is:0x88E8D063BC1DBB87A12FC5251BED42FA72EC37DE2DF199109B1573D7A0E085CE 
UE4 version: 4.27

Some static meshes can't be loaded with vanialla build as far that I'm aware of,I'll keep this thread updated for now until I find more information about that issue and as far when it comes to the animations I'm not sure if I'm able to extract it, but I'll keep this thread notifed if I find any solutions for that.

That's neat, my goal right now is try to extract the audios from the game.
