- Post Title: Cryo Big File - Making Of Ubik

Hi. I've been trying to extract the TGA images from this Cryo .BF archive for the Ubik game. I tried CRYOBF.BMS and CRYOZERO.BMS but have had no luck. The archive is from a Making Of program included on a press pack CDROM ([https://archive.org/details/UbikDreamst ... ck19970829](https://archive.org/details/UbikDreamstoRealityPressPack19970829)), and it includes a load of concept art for the game that I haven't seen anywhere before. Many thanks in advance for any help with this.

I've uploaded the archive here:
