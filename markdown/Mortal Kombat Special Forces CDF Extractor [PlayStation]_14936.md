- Post Title: Mortal Kombat Special Forces CDF Extractor [PlayStation]

Hi there 
First I play the game in 2000 on my PlayStation.After few years I found some kind of info about beta and unreleased stuff for this game.It started in 2013 for me and now I wrote [finished] some tool for extracting files of main SF.CDF datafile.Very simple binary format without any encoding/compression methods.

To extract or replace any file first you need to select any row.
Information inside edit boxes used for extraction and replacing purposes.
You can extract cdf file for specified level and open it with this tool.

```
Format specs.
===========================
Byte order: LittleEndian.
Header size = 20 bytes:
Name - 12bytes (with nulls);
Number of files - 4bytes;
CDFSize - 4bytes.
---------------------------
For each file:
Name - 12bytes (with nulls);
Offset - 4bytes;
Size - 4 bytes.
===========================
```

PS.Just for the history

I know this post is old but since a prototype of this game is now "available" it would be cool if someone upload this app again to see if there is something cool in that version. I've seen it's Sonya and also taking a look at the files there also some alt skins but sadly I can't see them
