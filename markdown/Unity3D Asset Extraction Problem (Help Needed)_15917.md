- Post Title: Unity3D Asset Extraction Problem (Help Needed)

This is my very first topic here, so I'll try to be clear and concise as I possibly can. You see, I've been meaning to extract graphics from a Unity3D game for my own personal use, but the extraction script written by Aluigi isn't functioning. It used to work well before until the game received a major update, so the error might have something to do with changes in the file itself.

I've tried other methods of ripping the files like UnityEX and Disunity, but none of them work for me so far. Could anyone point out what the problem is? If so, I would be happy to receive a solution or some helpful advice. If it's allowed, I could share the whole Unity3D file itself so someone can customize a Quick BMS script for it. Any kind of help would be welcome at this point.
