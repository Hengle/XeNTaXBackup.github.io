First success with RAW images:


RAW images is 8 bit and have palette in the end of file. For 505 KB RAW images palette index is 7E032, 4 bytes for colour.

Possible RAW image differences: palette index, bytes per colour(maybe).

If delete superfluous bytes textures will be normal palette view:


I think maybe was possible create bms script for converting\uncompressing textures.
