Can one of the mods or admins move this to the archive section seems this is a archive of some sort.

I thing the top of the file is giving file types as well as locations within it's self as to where each file begins and ends just a theory though..

example

```
ELIF....................
HSEM....................
EMIT....................
EPYT....................
SREV....................
ETAD....................
LRTM....}...............
RTXT................>...
RTXT................:...
RTXT............%...>...
RTXT............c...?...
RTXT................A...

RTXT............[...=...
RTXT................A...
RTXT................>...
RTXT................;...
RTXT............R...7...
RTXT................7...
RTXT................:...
RTXT................:...
RTXT............4...>...
RTXT............r...

```


And RTXT seems to be some form of autocad file.... not sure but thanks in advance to who ever moves this to the archive section.

Edit:
Applying more information to this

I assume that the game is using OBJ files as it's models... and is using MTL for the material related imports.

Edit 2:

Gah... It's compressed.

I assume it's compressed because I've learned that OBJ models may be stored within it and from my experience obj files are pretty much plain text values when opened in a hex editor/looking at strings.

And I really don't see any within this so I think it's compressed... so any admin or mod who looks at this please move it to the appropriate section.
