Can someone please point me to where I can download a version earlier than 3.0.0?

I have seen these version numbers:
1.3
2.2.1
2.3.4

Unfortunately the SDK was distributed to licensed developers. It is not intended for public distribution and/or use. As a result, this thread will now be locked.

Cheers.
