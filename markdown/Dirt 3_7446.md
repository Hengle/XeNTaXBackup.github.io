- Post Title: Dirt 3

Hello there, i just played Dirt3 and I really liked it.
I've got a Dirt tool, it works both Dirt and Dirt 2, and it can extract the texts of Dirt3, but when I inject the translated texts, all of the texts in game gets jumbles.


So, can anyone make a new text editor for it?
I've attached the English text file.


Thanks!

With this fixed .lng the tool you have will work fine to translate the game.
