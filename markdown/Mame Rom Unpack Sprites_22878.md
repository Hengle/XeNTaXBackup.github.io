I found this on the internet:

> MAME
>
> While playing a game, press F4 to see a palette screen. Then, press Enter to switch between the palette, pattern, and tilemap viewers. Pressing + or - increases and reduces the size of the entries. Pressing Up and Down on the keyboard goes through the entries, while Left and Right changes the palette. Pressing {/[ and }/] goes through the banks.

I think it's not possible until someone write a custom unpacker for this.
