- Post Title: New Game Request...

I searched the forums and didn't see Star Wars Galaxies listed.  While there is help in extracting the .TRE files, I would like to request some assistance in determining how to actually use the various types of files extracted.

I don't play the game myself, so I wouldn't be of much assistance there.
