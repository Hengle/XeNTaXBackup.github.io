Did you try this: [https://www.google.pl/search?q=modern+w ... 7gat64D4DQ](https://www.google.pl/search?q=modern+warfare+.pak&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&gws_rd=cr&ei=cZi1VMXZIOmt7gat64D4DQ)

I've not opened the links but the top 10 hits on google are all about the .pak files

Then theres also this: [viewtopic.php?f=10&t=12195](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=12195) (first google hit for 'Advanced warfare .pak).

If you've exhausted those options and gotten nowhere, then I'm sure someone will try to help you out.
