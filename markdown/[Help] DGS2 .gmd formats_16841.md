- Post Title: [Help] DGS2 .gmd formats

Hello, I need help with a few file formats. From the game Dai Gyakuten Saiban 2: Naruhodou Ryuunosuke no Kakugo.
They're an encrypted form of .gmd file used for MT Frameworks. I need a way to decrypt them, and re-encrypt them back.
Help would be much appreciated.
