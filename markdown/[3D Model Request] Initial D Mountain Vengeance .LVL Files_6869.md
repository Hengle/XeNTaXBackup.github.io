- Post Title: [3D Model Request] Initial D Mountain Vengeance .LVL Files

plz, can someone help me on this? many people around the 3d models world were really crazy to get track model files from Initial D Mountain Vengeance since it's very detailed! All i can do with 3DRipperDX was only ripping 1/4 part of the map. The game crashes if i do ALT+TAB. This is indeed the game with the most wanted map models. If u play the game, it looks terrible, but if u rip the track, u might be amazed to see a game that only requires low end PC to have a very detailed track with over more than 1000 polygon. So please, help me on this! Someone, aluigi or Mr.Mouse or someone. if there's no reply on this then i'd be doomed.

More than 1000 polygons for a whole track    Hehe i should hope so, 1000 polygons really isnt a lot. Id use approximately 500 polygons modeling a tree. Sorry but if an entire race track was done with about 1000 polygons. No matter what you do to it, it will not have a lot of detail, you just dont get detail in something that's 1000 polygons.

If your still determined to get these tho, the most important thing you can do is post some sample files. Nobody can do anything to help you if they do not have something to look at.

Well, you just altered this post, or could be said you just went off topic. But i liked your idea though. Go make a new post and provide example files of cars from the PS3 Initial D so people in the forum can take a look at it. Just hope someone is willing enough to look at those files for us. Or even get models out of that game for us :O
