- Post Title: Deponia PNG file extend

This is a game graphic font file for Deponia.

The PNG is 1024 x 1024, and encrypted on line 00000010.
I manage to extend this PNG into 3072 x 3072. But it can not be read in the game.

Is there anyone can help? Thx

I attach the PNG file.

Kind of curious why you needed to "extend it to 3072x3072"...

Because I want to let the game display Chinese and Japanese. 
1024x1024 is not enough for both language above. So it to extend to 3072 x 3072. But the file seems encrypted. After extended it can't be read inside the game.
