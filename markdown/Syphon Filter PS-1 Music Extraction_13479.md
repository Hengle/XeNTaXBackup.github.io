- Post Title: Syphon Filter PS-1 Music Extraction

Hi there!!!

Could you please help me to extract the music files from that game. I think the music are contained inside the 'FOG' folder, because there's a two versions of almost each file: that means maybe the ambient theme and the alert one. I extracted 'INGAME.XA' by 'Cube Media Player' and it contains only the SFX and dialogs used in game.
