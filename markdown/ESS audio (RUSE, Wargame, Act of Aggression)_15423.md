- Post Title: ESS audio (RUSE, Wargame, Act of Aggression)

Decoder & Encoder for ESS audio from Eugen systems games (RUSE, Wargame, Act of Aggression)

Drop ESS file onto ess_decode_mono or ess_decode_stereo.
Yes I need to make universal decoder, maybe it will be done later.

Drop mono WAV file onto ess_encode.
Only mono files are now supported for encoding.

You can also use command line and make batch files for multiple files.
