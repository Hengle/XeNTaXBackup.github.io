- Post Title: Duke Nukem: Megaton Edition PS3 | [MSF] Audio Format

Hey guys (and sorry for my english :>)

I trying to replace soundtrack in game Duke Nukem Megaton Edition to custom OST (PS1 ost), but this game is using MSF PS3 audio format.
It's possible to convert MP3 (or any other) format to MSF?

example MSF game file (futurmil.msf) in HEX:

```
00 00 AC 44 00 00 00 11 00 01 8B EC 00 7A 15 0F
FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF
FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF
FF FA E2 00 7F CB 00 0D F7 7C 82 B4 80 C6 4A 70
F3 50 36 50 25 29 6E 1E C2 0A D8 44 B1 31 43 E3
...

```


PS.
MSF format can be opened as a regular MP3 file but can't be replaced by another generic MP3 (game crashing)
