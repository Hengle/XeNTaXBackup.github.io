Anyone got a working importer for either format? 

I tried this Maya script but it didn't work:
[http://forums.cgsociety.org/showthread.php?t=1252023](http://forums.cgsociety.org/showthread.php?t=1252023)

I also tried the 3ds Max 7 Lithtech Jupiter tools, but it didn't work.

I also tried a maxscript, which failed as well, here's a sample with the script:

I spent hours looking for this and I got nothing. Anyone know what to do? Perhaps how to fix this script?

Just like Milkshape 1.6.4, it does not work on Windows 10.

Why are those EBR files there?

This was useful, but I still need something that can convert LTB/LTA.

ltb2x does not work on the models of this game.

I cannot use hex2obj and I need the animations anyway.

I have ltb2lta but I cannot open lta either.

Do you have a download for the ltb to smd tool you showed earlier?

I apologize for the bump, but I have not yet been able to open these files. Does anyone have any lead on how to open them?
