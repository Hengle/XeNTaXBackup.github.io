Hello guys! I'm kinda new about localizing games and I found this website! So... I kinda want to compare the Indonesian translation texts in Valorant with the English one.

I've searched on Youtube how to unpack it but can't find the solution yet  I just want to read and copy pasta those game texts! is there any tutorial somewhere here to unpack PAK files for Valorant? Thank you guys!
