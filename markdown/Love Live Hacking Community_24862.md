- Post Title: Love Live Hacking Community

I've been having trouble finding others interested/working in specifically love live hacking. This includes LLSIF, LLSIFAS, LLSIFASA, and any other love live game that was and is to be released.

Current project interests:
- Patching the after school activity arcade leak (you know where to look   ) (Primary interest)
- Preparing for the LLSIF servers to shutdown eventually; begin reversing the HTTP protocol used for their servers to create a private server
- More work on the KLBVFS system (more info in server)

I wouldn't say I'm a beginner when it comes to hacking, but things like using ghidra and figuring out how to patch the arcade leak has been challenging because of the lack of information. If anyone has any experience with using the arcade machines, ([https://imgur.com/a/KGH5jBA](https://imgur.com/a/KGH5jBA)) that would help greatly. (I need to confirm the use of a security USB stick that the leak is missing.)

For the preservation of Idol Hell!
