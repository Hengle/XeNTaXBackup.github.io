- Post Title: Battlefield 3 - QuickBMS 0.9.0 - Frostbite Script 0.3.5a

There's a problem using the Frostbite script to unpack Battlefield 3.

It looks like the script is trying to open "layout.sb" which doesn't exist in the Data\ directory.

Picture of Data\ directory:

Any solutions?

Hm, just noticed your post, well of course there is a solution, do NOT use that script, unfortunately its limited in its extraction capabilities.
A bit of research would have saved you lots of headaches, anyway, this is what you need to make things work, its where it all started.

And also there is a ton of information here on xentax if you run in to issues, just search and something will pop up.
