- Post Title: 0xFAIL Toolbox

I made a thread for suggestions: [viewtopic.php?f=29&t=7555](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=29&t=7555)

All the tools that are resulting from there are posted here. (This post will be updated)


So far:

V0.1 DDS RGBA header generator (will be expanded to support DXT12345 + RGB(A) (different encodings) + gets a GUI)

Tools will be hosted at [http://www.mechanical.co.at/0xFAIL/](http://www.mechanical.co.at/0xFAIL/) (so far there are no tools, will upload/link them later today)
