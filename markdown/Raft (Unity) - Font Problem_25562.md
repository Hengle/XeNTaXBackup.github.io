I know how to create and add new characters, but I don't have a game!
I could not find an updated generic version of the game to test and show you.

I don't teach, because nobody in teaching, I studied learn by myself.
And I will not help anymore, because of your attitude be more humble and YOU need help and not ME.

right, I bought the game on steam, to do the tests here is the image of the characters.
And be respectful to people at some point no disrespect with you.
I know how to do the characters, I just wanted to help.
I was forgetting at least in my tests I didn't even need to create the characters they already exist, I just changed the "รง" for testing purposes.
