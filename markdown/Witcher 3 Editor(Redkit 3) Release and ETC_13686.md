Just saw this.

Screenshot is mine, just decided to chime in here to clarify that i'm a different person than OP.
I've acquired the files after OP's leak and was unaware that it was a leak indeed (this was on nexus).
I managed to boot it and posted a screenshot which OP included, however in no way (besides downloading the files without knowing their legal status) i took part in the leaking process.

TL;DR OP used my screenshot but we're different people, just clarifying this so anyone from inevitable legal investigation does not put a == between me and OP.

As for you OP, kudos, but your effort may've been not worth the price - there's no guarantee that build from February can anyhow work with the game in reliable way.
Also i hope you're behind 7 Proxies, logging in from China/Russia using TOR, because i suspect CDPR is going to be mad at you. Like hell.

Yes sorry about that, but i'm not worried about cdprojektred, cant sue someone who has nothing to lose.
If they kept their promise i would have never needed to release redkit for them.

Well, since we've got that clear i guess everything's fair.

Since you don't seem to care, would you be willing to share the story behind the files? At least in general bullet points?
Why the Feb build?

Just my curiosity speaking, if you're not willing to share that in order to protect yourself, i fully understand.

End of the world.

No really. This is the true modding kit for Witcher 3 that allows you to pretty much do anything. CDPR has earlier released a Witcher 3 modding tool allowing you to only do some basic things which is very limited. Problem is the community has to make it work now, basically.

The files are from a devkit build of witcher3
This was not a internal leak from anyone at cdprojektred.

Why just the x64 folder, is that all you could recover? The files outside that are just as important. Not that I'm ungrateful, I've worked with less before 

Would be cool if you could upload the scripts folder under r4game too though, would save a lot of hassle.

Well, as fun as it was to get the Redkit to run somewhat reliably, i regret to inform OP that his sacrifice was ultimately just a costly consumer statement.
This tool cannot interface with the game in it's retail version, be it 1.00 or any later build.

Base difference lies in file format changes, Feb build (Redkit) uses 161 for each of the filetypes used by the engine, whilst retail is 162 (from 1.00 up to 1.11).
It'd take a very capable and patient reverse-engineer to make a batch converter for all of the file formats, that'd work both ways to allow those few people who've snatched the files while it was seemingly "legal" to even load game's content in this outdated editor(and no, it doesn't seem to be as simple as hex-editing the header so it'd report file being 161 instead of 162).

Even if that was done, there would be another hoop to jump through, this Redkit is heavily networked and relies on network environment in order to work. It tends to crash when it wants to do something with the networked content management and can't do it, because it's not there.

Not going even to mention that it took almost 2 days to even get the thing to boot and work somewhat reliably.

TL;DR: it's not worth anyone's effort (and risk) to get those files anymore (unless you're careless reverse-engineer who's very dedicated).
OP will get his ass burnt for providing us with something that's essentially useless and i feel genuinely sorry for him.

I hope you're on your way to China/Russia before you get the legal notice from CDPR.

Not sure why this thread lasted as long as it did, but that also may explain a lot - CDPR didn't care from the start, because this is essentially and old brick. Normally i'd imagine that DMCA would hit instantly CDPR noticed the leak, but maybe they don't really to care fast for this very reason - it's useless.
