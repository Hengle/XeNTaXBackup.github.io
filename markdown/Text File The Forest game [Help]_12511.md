- Post Title: Text File The Forest game [Help]

Could anyone help me to extract the text of this game, it's done in Unity 4. Most games made in Unity, the texts are located within the "resources.assets", but this is in "Main Data". Someone please help me, because I really want to translate this game, but I can not edit them and make the repack.

Below you can find the file link:
