Anyone have any interest in getting the japanese localization working? With Zestiria you could edit your appinfo.vdf or a cracks language setting to japanese, and it would enable the full game in Japanese, even though it was unreleased. Trying to get something similar for Berseria. It seems they didn't leave the japanese script files in this time though. But if you edit SYSTEMDATA\LANGUAGE.DAT, you can change the path of where to look for languages, to something like JPN so it looks at GAMEDATA\BASE\CHUNK0\GENERAL\LOCALIZE\JPN. I ripped the PS3 disc which has the same folder structure for localization, and put it in the JPN (even tried overwriting ENG) but its missing a FILEHEADER.TOFHDA file from the PS3 version JPN folder . TOFHDA are common to other Tales of titles as well, but it's encrypted and I'm not sure what it's doing. Anyone have any info or guidance on this?

There'n no *.TOFHDA for Tales of Berseria on PS3 version. I found that Chinese demo patch was work on and it doesn't need to edit *.TOFHDA.
But the important one it that the game only reads encrypted files.
