.ros are not only 3D models, it could be anything related to models!!!
for example: 
abomination_male_hierarchy.ros is a skeleton format!
abomination_male_paperdoll.ros is a description format! (part of text file)
act_abomination_male_weapon.ros is a empty container??

The 3D data are very simple, I can reconstruct them in a hour time!
But you basically uploaded one model (abomination_male), I doubt the actual format are all the same!
Could you upload a few more DIFFERENT models!

I've found a software "Machinima Studio" that can view the models from this game, but at first it is shareware and can't export the models, and the second it doesn't support animations (as i understand)...but if software exists that means that format maybe not very hard to understand. 

Fatduck you were writing that format is very easy, and as i understand you sucessfully imported the models, can you help and upload some tools for it or just help with this format. Please!

I can upload some fresh samples since I plan on getting some of these models with a certain clothing  (If there's still the need of getting this file format open)

The year's still fresh, but this model project of mine here isn't. [Here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=17xlg1RaBxvF1RfKOaU4wQoaVe_SEg5AM) are the samples which might be needed.

Have fun with them

I tried using the same values and you did, @shakotay2, but MeshExtractor refuses to work with me... What do I have to look for when I wanna get those meshes?

The parameters shown are for elf_female_torso_m121_g.ros only. (Other .ros files will require other params because they usually have different vertex counts for example.)

Is the max face index for each and every single model in this game different?

Then it seems I need to read that tutorial of yours really good and carefully... Thanks for clearing up.

EDIT: Is there a different way to open them up?

For a pro, yes, but for a newbie... At least double that 

Maybe I can get some stuff with that game started on either of the upcoming weekends or when I'm in night shift again.

You can use this tool to get the H2O file for the first submesh of a .ros file:
.


 Make_H2O-RunesOfMagic-test.zip
(64.22 KiB) Downloaded 31 times


Doesn't work with files such as elf_female_paperdoll.ros, act_elf_female.ros or elf_female_shoulder_[...]_x.ros!

Higher Lod H2O files contain uvs' addr now.

(Guess textured models would attract more interest so it would be nice if someone uploaded the texture files for elf_female_torso_m121_g.)

years late but here it is xD! Shakotay2! there is a way that you can add support for this kind of samples please?   [https://www.mediafire.com/file/uz5sme8h ... es.7z/file](https://www.mediafire.com/file/uz5sme8htoi5036/RoS_samples.7z/file)

You wouldn't expect me to do the whole job, do you? Before I go in action again you should at least

load elf_female_torso_m121_g into hex2obj, 
load the H2O file created by the Make_H2O tool,
export to .obj (File SaveAs mesh) and apply that texture.

Thanks!
Seems I don't have that elf_female_torso_m121_g.ros sample any more and the google drive link is dead.

Could you upload it, please?

But don't expect too much. Maybe I'll find the missing head (if it's not in another .ros file.)

btw! could you update your h2o tool to can generate the values for this samples too please?

That would require a revision of the code. As you may have noticed, it's a lower lod of the allosaurus.
Higher lod looks like so:

mount_allosaurus.png (126.25 KiB) Viewed 36 times



After so many years you maybe should think about using Noesis python to get what you want?

The uv address is around v_addr + v_count * 52.
(For some other samples it's v_addr + v_count * 40.)

Maybe some alignment required, +8 for example.
