- Post Title: EAGL-based NFS model formats dev'ed by EA BB/QL [.bin]

Well, here goes.

Cra0 and I started discussion on 3d data in different NFS Games in an audio thread for NFS Games,

I made this thread to continue discussions in the right board. (And I guess could also be expanded to other EAGL-based NFS games using this file container. (And the different variations of it)

This thread is mainly for geometry (.geo), textures (.tpk/.xml*), animations (.ani), and well other related stuff. (3d offsets of wheels, buildings, etc)
*xml tags are how Licence plates and vinyls textures are "stored" in NFS:W
