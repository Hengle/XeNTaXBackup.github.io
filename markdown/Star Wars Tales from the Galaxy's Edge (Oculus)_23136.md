Star Wars: Tales from the Galaxy's Edge (Oculus) tool.
Static & skeletal models, maps supported.

Details about tool usage are the same as for FF7 tool, described here: [viewtopic.php?p=162674#p162674](https://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?p=162674#p162674)

There's one difference: this game uses automatically generated Hierachical LODs, which creates a lot of static meshes with same names. They are just low detail versions of other meshes, so you have to delete them before converting maps. You can either delete \Game\Environments\HLODs\ before preparing static models for maps, or after that, delete all files named like SM_HLODClusterActor... from created staticmesh.raw folder.

Hi Everybody!
I've managed to extract the fully assembled Workshop and Cantina, including Props.The models are just..., great!
The problem comes when i try to do the same with the Mubo's cargo Ship. All the meshes and textures are there, but there's no way i can assemble them following the instructions.
I have been trying several times with no success.
Has anybody managed to extract the interiors?
Thanks

Has somebody extracted the C-3PO model from the game? I'm wondering if anyone can send it to me so that I can try to 3d print part of it.
