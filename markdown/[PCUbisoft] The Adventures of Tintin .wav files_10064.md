- Post Title: [PC/Ubisoft] The Adventures of Tintin .wav files

Can anyone help me with this? With Aluigi's script I managed to extract the .bf files in this game. The music is included in one of the archives, but I can't seem to play it back properly.

The files start with a RIFF WAVE header, and some information... "SLib_encoder" "libvorbis" "vorbis+BCV".

Bringing this ooold thread back up, I was wondering if there's a solution to cleanly play the music files from the Tintin game?

I've managed to extract all the music to WAV files using the tintin.bms, but the files only play (at least in WinAmp) when renaming them to OGG. But even then the files only play as mono and with stuttering, which sounds like the actual L and R channels are played in alternating chunks. I guess this is called interleaving?

Here's one of the files: [https://www.mediafire.com/file/f67o814w ... A.wav/file](https://www.mediafire.com/file/f67o814wbrtnnyc/GallionA.wav/file)

Is there a good way to convert these into clean stereo files?
