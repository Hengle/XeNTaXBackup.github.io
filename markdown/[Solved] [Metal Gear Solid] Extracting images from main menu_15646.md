- Post Title: [Solved] [Metal Gear Solid] Extracting images from main menu

Hey all,

I am totally new to this but I hope my matter is not too troublesome. I want to do a custom animated GIF based on the 1998 Metal Gear Solid main menu screen as it is shown below but I want to use the animated background, Snake's face and the 'PRESS START BUTTON' text only without the other fonts. Is there a way to extract these files and if so, where can I find these files and how can I do this? By the way, I own both, PSX and PC version, which would be better for that?

Thanks in advance.

EDIT: Problem is solved, I found it out myself.
