The files are indeed compressed with zlib in this archive, but I haven't seen it yet in the other ones. Each compressed file has a 32-bit value at the start of file which contains uncompressed file length.

I haven't had the time to really look into this format, but someone appearantly has...

What i must do with this files. Where to unpack them, and when I play the game everything is white. I think that is becouse I have ATI Radeon 9200 SE, and that card has only 1.0 shaders.

What do you think.
