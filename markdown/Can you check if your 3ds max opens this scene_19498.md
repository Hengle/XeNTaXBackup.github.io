I'm experimenting a bit with 3ds max 2012 and would like to know if another version can open the scene archive attached. Could someone check please?

It's not a virus, people. I'd really use the help.

That's wonderful: do you have any optional plugin installed?

Great. Can you check if, by chance, you can export without issues to FBX?

Eh I knew it was almost too good to be true. So it doesn't export properly? To any format at all?

I'm able to export it to fbx but it will have no materials because of what was posted above.

No materials hence no textures either?

No textures that I can find. The model is completely black when loaded.

Obviously it was too good to be true, for a simple workaround to work.

The textures are actually packed in the archive, but if it can't find them...

Many thanks. I'll have to reinstall 3ds max or think of something else. The model comes from Dragon age and I got it off with eshme script.

It works in Gmax but not 3ds max... every time I try to open the material editor it crashes.

It worked in 2018 after I installed the Dragonage plugin from here: [https://www.nexusmods.com/dragonage/mods/895/?tab=files](https://www.nexusmods.com/dragonage/mods/895/?tab=files)
I just went into Slate, right-click the material, and selected "Show material in viewport" and it looked fine.

In 2018? I'm quite surprised. Thanks for the tip. x86 or x64?

Thank you. It doesn't crash, but doesn't load the textures either. Could it be because 3ds max needs a plugin for DDS textures?

Did you change the material so its visible in the viewport?

I don't think I did - what am I supposed to do?

Press "m" to open the slate material editor then right-click on the material and select one of the 2 "show in viewport" options

For the life of me, I can't see any "show in viewport" option. Is there any way to ensure all materials are shown automatically?
Do you see the models textured?
