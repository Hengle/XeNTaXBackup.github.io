Does anybody know if there is a tool that lets you specific the colorformat, (RGB565, RGB888 and so on) and endianess for imagedata (and palette)?
[tiledggd](http://code.google.com/p/tiledggd/) Is doing a great job but it lacks severall colorformats.

Well there's this...which is somewhat easier to use and looks like there's more color formats but then there's less options to work with.

I'd probably end up using both .

You might also look into using Tile Molester, which has some open source stuff and you can use it to define new things, if you know java.
