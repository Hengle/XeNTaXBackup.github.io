- Post Title: Genshin Impact Closed Beta (.blk, .asb)

So the second closed beta for Genshin Impact (Mihoyo's new RPG, creators of Honkai Impact) and I was chosen for both of them.
I'm extremely interested in this game's models and I would love to reference them for my own art, but the folders in the game are filled with files I've never seen before in a Unity game.
The first beta used .asb, the second (current) one uses .blk
Everything except for audio and video are stored in these files.
Normal tools like asset studio and UABE don't work on them.
I've asked elsewhere and apparently they're using some type of XOR encryption? I'm not entirely sure on what this means or how to use this info but I've received this key for the .asb files:

```
\x0f\xfb\xf5\xbb\xf6\x81\x48\x15\xfa\xd7\x77\x35\x82\x17\xd9\x9d
\x56\x28\x2e\xa9\x51\xba\x66\x2f\x22\xdd\xbb\x8a\x3b\xad\x90\x63
\xc6\x64\xfb\xd6\xcf\xa8\xbc\x48\x02\xc3\xbe\x36\xb2\x93\xbc\xd9
```


I've included samples below for both formats.
