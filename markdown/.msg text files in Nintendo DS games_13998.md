Hi everyone,

It looks like MySims NDS games uses *.msg files for the text. Any ideas how to open them? I've searched for it, I didn't found anything.

The whole msg folder that is in the first MySims game on NDS: [http://www.mediafire.com/download/q1g98 ... qq/msg.zip](http://www.mediafire.com/download/q1g981fj2vw2bqq/msg.zip)
I hope someone will figure out how to read these files. Thanks
