- Post Title: Killzone 2 *.core files

Hi there! I've just extracted the big 6GB file from Killzone 2 for the PS3. It mostly contains *.core files with a RTTI identifier at the start, which I couldn't seem to write a proper script. And help would be highly appreciated! Thanks for your help! 
Here's an example file: [http://www.gamefront.com/files/20721707 ... u_music.7z](http://www.gamefront.com/files/20721707/assets_description.svo.svomainmenu_svomainmenu_music.7z)

Hello,

after extracting data_ps3.psarc using a psarc extractor, i encountered these .core files. from here on out, i dont know how to proceed. i want to know how to uncompress these so i can extract models/vertex data and, if possible, textures. any suggestions/solutions on how to do this? i will include a link below to a google drive so you can access samples.

thank you
