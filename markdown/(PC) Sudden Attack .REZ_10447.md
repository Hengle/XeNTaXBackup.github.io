- Post Title: (PC) Sudden Attack .REZ

I'm a fan of MMOFPS, especially Sudden Attack, this game use Lithtech Engine, but doesn't like Combat Arms or CrossFire which have an extractor. If we want to extract resource of SA, we need to update and then get it, but i want to ask you if we can extract the .REZ file, means use an extractor, cause i have some old files of SA, and i don't want to update, it will be lost. So can you help me to check out this kind of .REZ files? Sorry for my bad English 

Sample files:
