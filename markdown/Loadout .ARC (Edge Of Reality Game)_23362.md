- Post Title: Loadout .ARC (Edge Of Reality Game)

Hello there 
Haven't posted in a while.

There used to be a game named Loadout, 3rd person cartoony shooter with the feature of making custom guns. 
The game itself is dead, unfortunately. 

It runs on a custom made engine I guess so could anybody take a look at the archives format? 
[There's](https://www.dropbox.com/s/bhpihmrz3m3m0kb/Data.zip?dl=0) the link to one of the game's archive and some other files I've found in the directory.

Thanks in advance!
