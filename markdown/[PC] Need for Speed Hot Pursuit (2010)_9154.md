Hello everybody, 

I'm trying to extract audio files from Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit, to be more specific I'm trying to extract the announcer's audio files - the one that describes the cars and gives you a brief description of them once you select them. Now, I have a hunch that these sounds are located in the EN_US folder with all of the .sps files - however, when converted they are just police radio-chat sound files. However, I have read in some NFS forum that the car and announcer files are located across different .BNDL files. Now, I've tried opening the .BNDL files with NFSHTExplorer but all they contain are car models and texture files. 

If anyone has experience with extracting files, especially sound files from this game - could you land a helping hand by telling me in which files the announcer sound files are located at?

Thanks,
Brian.

im currently trying to convert SPS files in need for speed hot pursuit remastered and i found that some SPS files worked fine and converted to mp3 with no issues. but some do not and i don't understand why. I'm currently attempting to convert the SPS files in the nfshp/ui/streams directory because i have reason to believe that the siren sounds im looking for may be in there. but its not working, can anyone help? ive attached a screen shot.
