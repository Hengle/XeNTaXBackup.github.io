hello , i'v been searching for unpacking tools for SDO or (DANCE ONLINE USA) to get the models / animations / textures
i'v find a Super Dancer Online-Xtreme Season 3 SAI Decryptor / SAC Extractor created by h4x0r , it unpacks the Datas.sac and Datas.sai and unpacks the files inside them , but there are still some files like Motions (.MOT) and (.DDS) files and XMESH Files (.MSH) i still cant import the textures / animations etc .. to a 3d program to use them ,

can i get some help in that ?! i can upload any requested file for tests .

please help me , thank you
