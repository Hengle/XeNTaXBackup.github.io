- Post Title: [REQ] Umineko Golden Fantasia (LZLR file format)

Hello everyone.
I would like to know, if there is any tool that can be used to unpack files with the header (LZLR) from the game Umineko: Golden Fantasia (PC Steam release)

From the looks of it, the game seems to be using common formats, only compressing them using an algorhytm, which has LZLR in the header)

There are also *.SE and *.CG and *.BIN files which seems to not have any header at all.
other than those files mentioned, the game seems to use standartized DDS, WMA and MPG formats

If anyone would be willing to look at it I would be grateful!

Link to the files:

Thanks in advance!
