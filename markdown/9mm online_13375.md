- Post Title: 9mm online

Hi,

in the past there was a game called "Mercenary wars" by publisher uforia ( game engine unknown, i think selfmade ) this publisher went bankrupt. So the publisher stopped their publishing and so on.
Some years later another publisher called "Funizen" hosted their game, now called "9mm online".

The game had almost no protection or anything, it was laggy and had not that much content and features.
BUT i liked their maps.

Well, game engine unknown, the mapfileformat doesn't have any information or else.
I decrypted their attributes/scripts but wasn't able to get more informations.

Is there anyone who is maybe able to get the map read by noesis, or get it into any other useful format or else?

I hope anyone will have success and i made my thread the proper way.



Sincerely Zenshin

P.S. The .rar owns the mapfile .dva ( largest one ) , a mapdata.dsc and the pathfiles for this map.
