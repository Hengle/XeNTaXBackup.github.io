- Post Title: Fatal Frame Character Models

I know that there have been people who have managed to get the textures for this game before. But the tread is several months old and despite my best efforts, I'm still a novice when it comes to doing this myself, and without a tutorial that my brain will comprehend, I don't think that I will. (But I'll keep trying)

I'm hoping to get the character models from the fatal frame games. Miku, Mafuyu, Mio, Mayu, Rei, and Kei. I'd like to get Chitose from Fatal Frame 2 as well but if it's so much of a hassle, then kicking her to the curb will be fine. 

If need be, I can provide ripped DVD Image files of the game to be used, or if anyone is willing to help, maybe I can do it myself, with someone giving me an idea on what I'm supposed to do :/

Thanks in advance.

Well, you can't put up the DVD isos as that falls into the category of warez. You could provide some of the data files though that contain models or if they aren't in a data file that would be good.

I'll grab the data files then and upload them. I'm not 100% sure big they'll be. Should I leave the data files named as the files they're originally? Or rename them so you can tell what data cab came from which game?

You could just archive them and name the ZIP or RAR you put them in and title it thusly. I kinda think it's better to keep the files as they are, and compression with RAR or ZIP tends to decrease download time. Just make sure it's the data file(s) containing the models.

To make sure that I don't send out the wrong ones, how can I check to see which of the data files have the models? Or should I make an assumption? Usually for these games there is only 1 data file, but it's relatively large.

Yeah, I know those. In that case I guess there is little choice but to ZIP/RAR it and upload somewhere. Possibly in parts. In any which case the one big datafile may have with it another file with the same name but smaller correct?

Alternatively, you can post a list of files inside the DVD with their name and size detail. 

If I were you, I would just cut some files and upload straight away rather than spending two/three days asking what files should you upload!?

You see, people lost thier interest easily and quickly!

I didn't spend 2 to three days asking what files I was supposed to upload, I -do- have a job that I work, and I also, alternatively, did not have access to the forums due to some unforseen error. So back off.

Logically speaking the only files I know of that may have the data I'm looking for are the largest files within the DVD, I could be wrong however, which is why I had originally asked for a suggestion as to what to look for.

Currently I'm working on getting them zipped/rarred up, but with as large as the files are it's taking a generous amount of time.

I guss all the data you needed were in those ".bin" files(the big onces).

Use the file cutter(you can found it in the forum) to cut it down in parts and upload it here.

All right here's another quick question, what's the file limitation on uploads? So I know what to split the file into and what size they have to be.

There is quite a choice to choose from out there.

megaupload and yousendit work well enough.

I haven't died yet. I'm using Megaupload for the files, but it's taking an exceedingly long time for them to upload, I compressed them to the best I could, (one is at 800 MB instead of 1.2 GB) but it's still taking time. I'll post the links as soon as they're done.

I am not trying to be rude but I would really surprise if anyone would really download a 2G file for not even sure if that is the right one!? At least not for me!

That why I already suggest you to cut them into a small pieces and upload them here. There are not need to be a full data at this stage!

The most important thing is get others in interest! Well, Good luck!

I'm doing only as was suggested by Fox. *frowns* Especially given that there would be too many small peices to upload here if the limit is barely 256kb.

Just want to say first, I don't know how to code, or program. I've only just used a hexeditor before, so all I know is how to open a file up

Anyway taking a look at fatal frames files, obviously the HUGE 1.07GB file is holding all the game models and textures. searching the string "TIM2" there are lots of instances ^_^ so now I can generate a small offset list 

you wonder how this helps. well if I have a bunch off absolute offsets, then all I have to is post the top header of the large file. really no more then 256kb of it is needed. then this is the first step of getting raw file extraction

Though I strongly feel that there is no offset header in the large file, as there are two BINs
IMG_BD.BIN 1.07GB
IMG_HD.BIN 14.8kb


I'm betting the other bin is an index to that larger file.

So here is a bunch offsets taken from "IMG_BD.BIN" of some TIM2 files. and along with that the top portion of the larger file.

I hope this helps in some way

I took a quick look but i'm just learning about these things as well...
I recommend reading the "guide to file archive exploration pdf" on teh main xentax.com website

It has some sample and common file structures to look for, for examples, the first 4 bytes could be a grais, then the next 4 bytes tells how many files in the archive, then the next 4 bytes tell the offset of the first file.. then the filesize of the file in the archive.. and so forth

good luck

I did quickly look for those things, along with the offsets I posted. but came out with nothing, therefore I'm just merely handing this over.

Trying to do this myself given my time constraints (I hate work) it's become difficult for me to do these extractions myself right now. I'll have to find a day that I can spend entirely engrossing in trying to get this done.

Here's a new problem that has arised that I'm still trying to get the technojargon to set in... How do I extract the textures from the game and not have them look like 6-color graphics?

I'd like to manage to extract the textures as they were when they're seen in the game (16/32 bit graphics) otherwise they're going to be a bit cartoony and not viable for the reason I need them.

Well it's been 3 years lol Don't think I got any smarter, but hopfuly slightly more educated on this stuff.

OK, soo lets go over what I've been able to do. and also thanks to chrrox for showing me how to use maxscript

right, I looked again at that large BIN file, discovered that the offsets to the file locations are stored in a seperate BIN file. but no names 
I looked around the ELF file for the game, and discovered that the names are indexed in the executable  yay... though wasn't able to figure out the folder system.. its indexed a bit different, ohwell.

Dumped the files, and got alot of new file extensions. Though ironically they're all the same generic file container.. so also had to split each dumped file.. then I got lots of interesting stuff.. 

I believe the models and textures are stored in the MDL files. I wrote a maxscript importer to get the geometry, but all I can get are the verts. when I attempt to draw faces, they're all over the place. already tried triList and triStrip method, neither worked for me 

Can someone please help me, see if they can render faces correctly?

for now I'm just working from a small sample from in the MDL.
(you can find that sample, and my scripts attached to the ned of the post)

verts are at: 0x0171
norms are at: 0x0250
faces are at: 0x040C

the structure of the sample is quite easy
its like;
bones
materials
verts
norms
faces
texture coordinates (i hope)

I haven't fully figured out how the file indexes to each section, or how its looped properly.

also you can find all the MDL's from FatalFrame1 zipped here

I think the file is slightly different than you have described. This game uses the RenderWare engine, which is quite complex as in other RW games, some models uses face index triangles but are converted to Playstation 2 tristrips "on the fly". In this game some of the files also indeed have the same vertexes 2 times, once at the beginning of the file in the long list and once in the middle to end of the file. Vertexes are found after this header: 00 00 00 20 40 40 40 40 01 80 XX 78
where XX is the number of Vertexes. But even one file is not consistent with each other as some have a vertex's respective normal, right after each vertex, while some are just vertexes, while others a short string of normals after the above mentioned header before switching, to Vertex-Normal. I have seen the excat header "00 00 00 20 40 40 40 40 01 80 XX 78" in more than 12 other PS2 games as headers like that are a sony PS2 tristrip format, however the additon of RW stuff makes this file hard to anyalzye.
