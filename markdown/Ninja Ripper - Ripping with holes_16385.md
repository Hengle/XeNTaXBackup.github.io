- Post Title: Ninja Ripper - Ripping with holes

(Sorry about my possible english problems!)

Good day! I'll be brief, when i rip a model from Artstation or Sketchfab (*I do not have the problem with some models*) and i open the meshes on 3DSMAX using Gims EVO they bring some holes.

*I already tried ripping more than 10 times and changing the "Forced rip interval" too, but does not appear to have made any difference.
*The problem only happen on some models i tried to rip, i already ripped some models a lot of times (*for test*) and the holes don't appear.
*I use Mozilla Firefox to rip. (Already tried Google Chrome)

Please, if you know how to fix help me!
