- Post Title: 3D models from Madagascar 3: The Game (Xbox 360)

Hello! I have come to this forum in search for help on exporting 3D models from the game Madagascar 3 for the X360, i have yet to find anyone else do it so i figured i may aswell do it if nobody else will.. So far i've managed to get ahold of an ISO file regarding the game but i can't seem to find the model location or anything model related inside of said iso, unless i am doing something wrong.. Help would be greatly appreciated!

(Or better yet, PS3 models would be greater since PS3 has better resolutio when it comes to textures and models aswell as polygons i recon)
