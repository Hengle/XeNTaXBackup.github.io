- Post Title: Power Stone [Dreamcast] - Extracting .BIN Files

Hey, everyone.

I have been interested in trying to extract and possibly modify the audio files in Power Stone. Specifically, the Dreamcast version since the PSP version has a different audio format. The music is in ADX format, which is easy enough to modify. However, most of the game's files (possibly sound effects and voices) seem to be held within .BIN files.

I wonder if anyone would be able to help me out with this.

Below is two examples of the .BIN files from the game.

Appreciating any help!
