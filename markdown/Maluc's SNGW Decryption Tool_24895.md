- Post Title: Maluc's SNGW Decryption Tool?

Hello all, I was wondering if anyone had a copy of maluc's SNGW Decryption tool? It appears the domain does not hold the website it was on anymore, and the latest it was still online was November 2020 [according to archive.org.](https://web.archive.org/web/20201111191754/http://www.sb-online.org/maluc/index.php?did=sngwdec) Trying to decrypt Resident Evil Revelations 2 audio files at the moment.

This tool seems to be completely gone form the internet.

But maybe try these alternatives:

[https://github.com/hpxro7/wwvorbis-go](https://github.com/hpxro7/wwvorbis-go)

And this may be decryption method implementation for SNGW files from  Devil May Cry 4 and  Resident Evil Revelations 2:

Also, foobar2000 with vgmstream plugin can play SNGW files without any issues.

I was looking for it too, and I think I managed to find it! 

I wonder what happened to that Maluc guy?
