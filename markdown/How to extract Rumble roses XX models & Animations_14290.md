- Post Title: How to extract Rumble roses XX models & Animations?

Hello, I'm new to this site and to ripping and modding 3D models, I wanted to ask how would I go about extracting the Rumble Roses XX models and animations that are in the game itself if possible. I've researched through this site and youtube, from what I've found I need a modded Xbox 360 console and a way to transfer files into my PC for modding with a software like 3DS Max. Is this true? If so, are the animations extracted in same way? 

Thanks for any and all replies

Hi, first you need to unpack the iso file. You should get several *.pac files.

  -- /pac/ch/*.pac => has default models of each character.
  -- /pac/ed/*.pac => has common swimsuits.

Use QuickBMS and the attached bms script to extract files from *.pac files.
[http://aluigi.altervista.org/quickbms.htm](http://aluigi.altervista.org/quickbms.htm)

About File formats:

  -- PAC file has consecutive PACH files.
  -- PACH file has consecutive raw files such as YOBJ (model), TEX (includes DDS textures) and so on.

After you got raw files, checkout Mr. Mario's video. [https://youtu.be/P9Y-OaOqpxg](https://youtu.be/P9Y-OaOqpxg)
His maxscript allows you to import models into 3ds Max, trial version is fine.

> are the animations extracted in same way?

I haven't seen anyone does it.

I'm so sorry disturbing you now....
The QuickBMS with that BMS dosen't works for the "sound.pac"
Is there anyway which could resolve this?
