- Post Title: Smackdown Vs Raw 2011!

Hi guys i'm new here and just wanted to ask a couple of questions!

1) Is there any way to extract the character models (especially for the CAWS) for the Smackdown Vs Raw 2011? Also is there any method to get Brejing's PT explorer for SVR 2011 without buying it?

2) Has there been anyway found to extract the models for Splinter Cell Conviction? Gildor tired but he failed in doing so for some reason!

Note : Please dont post here saying that i should serch! I tried but whenever i serchd my browser just said that the Page is Not Available!

Thnks in advance

The method for extracting models for SvR is easily found here using the search function or going to my forums.  My tool doesn't have a PT explorer, but I've said multiple times on my forums if I ever did make a PT explorer for 2011 it would be free, but from your questions, it's easy to see your ignorance, so I can understand how you are easily confused and think my editor has anything to do with the PT, which it doesn't.

I know, because using the search function or clicking on my link above would actually require you to read ...

This is why some people can hack games, and some people can't.  The people that won't read, are the ones that can't.  Hacking games isn't handed to you on a silver platter, you have to want it bad enough.
