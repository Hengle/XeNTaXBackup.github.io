- Post Title: Extracing Unreal 2: The Awakening Models And Animations?

So I want to extract Unreal 2: The Awakening models, and animations. Its not compatible with Umodel, And I'm 100% positive UnrealEd doesn't do extractions. The models I'm looking for are Weapons, which are apparently ".gem" and the animations are somewhere, I can't seem to find them. I think maybe they're packed with their models, both in the same .gem. I've searched everywhere, but couldn't find anything useful. Here is a zip I made with all the weapons .gem's: [http://www.mediafire.com/download/ot9y8 ... eapons.rar](http://www.mediafire.com/download/ot9y86pw679q52p/Weapons.rar) If anyone could help me get these to .smd or something openable in 3DSmax, Milkshape, etc. Any help is appreciated! Thanks. -Blaze

@Player Thank you! But, well. I can't get it to work. It just says "This app can't run on your PC. To find a version for your PC, check with the software publisher" :/ Tried different compatibility modes, and running as admin. Still says that.
