- Post Title: [NOVA3 the mobile game] Extracting ( .gla ) archives

Hello there fellas, so I'm looking for a way to extract these .gla archives from NOVA3, yea the HALO bootleg for mobile released in 2012.

The available .apk found around the internet is the v1.0.1d version, supposedly an update to the game in 2016. The only tool dealing with this type of archive is @cra0's Gameloft Archive Tool, which can be found on the lad's website ( huge kudos to the big balls move ): [https://cra0.net/blog/posts/archived/20 ... -tool-gla/](https://cra0.net/blog/posts/archived/2014/gameloft-archive-tool-gla/)

When feeding the actors.gla archive into the program, the window just freezes at about 20% then close itself without any output. A rough QuickBMS code by @JayK in a similar topic from 2012 ([viewtopic.php?p=79006#p79006](https://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?p=79006#p79006)) also terminates itself at 0% when I fed the .gla to it. 

I am seeking the resources of that game to mod them as skins into several games that I can make skins for, and above all else this game also holds great sentimental value to me as one of the first games I've ever played which would be great if I can have the models at my disposal for 3d printing or just papercrafting. Any suggestions and recommendations are greatly appreciated 

Thanks in advance
