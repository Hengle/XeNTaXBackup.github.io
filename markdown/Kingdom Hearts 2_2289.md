I know Yaz0r is working on a viewer. Was wondering if anyone else had made any progress?

well the game is DVD 9 so it needs to be ripped correctly lol.
But Yaz0r has doena  viwer and extractor, i DID look at the source for his viewer and even his extractor btu i dont know C++ so i couldnt make heads or tails of it really, only that certain data is in CERTAIN bytes n stuff like that.

But if you can post the source to the extractor here then im sure someone might be able to figure out how to convert the extracted model file to and OBJ or soemthing like that.
