- Post Title: Texture Extraction

Hello guys, I have a texture with dimensions 512x512. How do i convert that into a tga or any image format (or even better in c# with bitmaps)? (first 2048 bytes is the color palette, the other bytes are image data). idk actually know but i assume they are 4 bpp and 16bit color palette.

In the attachment you can find the texture.
