- Post Title: World of Tanks/Bigworld engine models (.primitives)

Hi all.
World of Tanks game has its own models in .visual/.primitives/.model filetypes.
That filetypes cannot be viewed in vanilla 3Ds Max. So, i tried to find some plugins for it, but...
I spent some time in googling usable solution for this, but the only way i found - to buy the Indie License of Bigworld Tech, for 299$. 
I`m not finding this way suitable, cuz my interest is limited in couple of models.
Is there any another solutions for this situation?

Right the Indie version of BigWorld is $300 USD

There is a leak of 1.9 but warez are not allowed here so I can't any more then that.
The latest version is 2.x

I added the .primitives loader module to the 3D Object Converter 4.604 and I released this update package now.

Please install the v4.60 or use the v4.60 portable version.

After that you must upgrade to the latest version (v4.604) using the Help/Check for updates... function.
