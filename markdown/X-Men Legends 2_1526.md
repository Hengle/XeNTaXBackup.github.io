The 1st one just seemed to have used a regular ZIP file. But it looks like they took it a little farther in the sequel. Attached is a .WAD file. From what I've looked at, the end of the file contains all of the filename encrypted. Could you guys please take a look at it? Thanks a bunch guys!! 

P.S. It's outsourced off of my PC, cause it seems like max upload is 256kb, and your cutter's 256kb option makes it 784kb... o.O

Let me know if you need anything.

Re: the file cutter - you are using the one by Mr Mouse and for some odd reason it appears as though it was cutting the wrong size - it should be cutting 256k from the front and the back of the file, whereas it was doing 512k from front and back. Oh well - better to have more than less.

Something you can tell us though, is the size of the archive - if the directory is at the end of the archive like you assume then we need to know how to jump to the directory so we can read it.

Alternatively in the future you could use my file cutter instead as it already includes this information in the zip it creates - but obviously the choice is yours, and they both do the same primary thing which is to grab some of the archive data. You can grab mine at [http://www.watto.org/extract/download/cutter.zip](http://www.watto.org/extract/download/cutter.zip) if you wish.

Thanks mate.

Wow! Thanks guys! However, your download doesn't work. When I open it, it shows BIN.zip, and that that file is corrupted
