I found a .h2o file unpacker, and works great, but where i can found the h20 file creator/packer?
It' s a file format of: "The war of the ring", thanks

I think the h2o format is a generic archive structure used by a company called Liquid Entertainment or something. I thought it was used for installer packages, not for the actual game. Here is the structure that I have come across before...

```
| Battle Realms *.h2o |
+---------------------+

// NOTE: This archive is unusual in that the directory contains 4 times more entries
// than the number of files in the archive, yet it only repeats twice.

480 - Header (starting with "//" + "*" x54 + "//")
1 - Unknown (26)
4 - Version (6)
4 - Number Of Files
4 - null
4 - Decompressed File Data Size
4 - Compressed File Data Size
4 - null
4 - Compressed File Data Size
12 - null

// for each file [*4]
  4 - File ID?
  4 - Decompressed File Size
  4 - Compressed File Size
  4 - Unknown
  4 - File Offset
  4 - null
  8 - Unknown
  4 - null
  4 - Unknown ID

X - File Data
```


We should be able to make a script for this, that also allows importing, however the files are compressed by an unknown method so packing the archive again probably won't work.

Yeah I got some specs on this format from somewhere a while ago too - and I implemented it in Game Extractor - but I havn't implemented the decompression  - in which case I would recommend you use the specialised unpacker given here.

One thing to note, however, is that there is a newer update of the H2O format which I found in a game (DragonShard) a few weeks ago, so if the unpacker here doesn't work for some games then this is probably the reason.
