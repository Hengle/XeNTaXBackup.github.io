- Post Title: Spider-Man Friend or Foe PSP Audio

We at the MarvelMods community are trying to get the Spider-Man Friend or Foe PSP audio files extracted, as they have exclusive audio not in the other versions of the game.

The audio files are in .pcp and .sbk format, but we can't figure out how to get into these.

Any assistance or advice would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks!

Here are the audio files, still in their original folders:

The game turns out to have 3 file types: .sbk, .str, and .pcp. PSound can extract all the .sbk and most of the .str but the .pcp I have no idea what they are or how to open them.
