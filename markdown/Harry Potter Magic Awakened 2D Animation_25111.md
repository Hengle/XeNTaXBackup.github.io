- Post Title: Harry Potter Magic Awakened 2D Animation

Hello! So recently I have been going through the files of the netease game Harry Potter Magic Awakened. One of the functions of this game is that it has animated emotes and I was interested in being able to animate them myself. I don't have much experience with animation so I am not really sure how exactly to do that, the animation folder has 3 types of files .dat, .png and .txt
I tried going through them and match them to be able to show examples

These are the files; If I did it right hopefully the .dat and .txt should match with the png

So does anyone know how exactly I can animate them?

I'm too lazy to add animation.  

(write tx name anf txt inside script line 19 and 20) 
(and yes i don't use "edge" and "vertices" instead just "uv" and "triangles")
