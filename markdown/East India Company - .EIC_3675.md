I have figured the encryption but you must wait a new version of quickbms because the algorithm requires the full name of the file so 21GZ.eic can't work while Config\21GZ.eic or c:\blahblah\Config\21GZ.eic work.
the script is here: [http://aluigi.org/papers/bms/eic.bms](http://aluigi.org/papers/bms/eic.bms)

unfortunately seems that the original names of the files can't be recovered, the algorithm used for generating them doesn't seem "reversable" for doing the opposite.

so wait some days for the new 0.3.5 version
