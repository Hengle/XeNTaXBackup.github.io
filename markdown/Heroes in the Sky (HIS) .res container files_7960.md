- Post Title: Heroes in the Sky (HIS) .res container files

Heroes in the Sky is a free-to-play arcade style flight MMO. I'm hoping someone can find a way to extract the .res files allowing access to the game's textures and models. They are .zip files encrypted with a password.
I've uploaded the HIS2.res file here: [http://www.mediafire.com/?w4b3wmarxgu0qkq](http://www.mediafire.com/?w4b3wmarxgu0qkq)
Any help would be great! The game is free to download and play here: [http://his.gamescampus.com/news/](http://his.gamescampus.com/news/)

they are normal zip files, the only problem is that some of them (like HIS6.res) have a password.

take a look at the following topic if you can catch it with the methods explained there (signsrch + ollydbg):
