- Post Title: how to open this file?

It is a few days that I have worked on a project to edit the data of software "Rosetta Stone". Studing on the software, I recognised that the data is kind of flash swf. However, these files are so compacted or encrypted that there is no common programme to decode it.
Please help me to do it.
Thanks a lot .

Those are just Flash files with compression enabled, you can look at the file spec for SWF to see how to decompress them.

You can get the PDF with the swf spec here: [http://www.adobe.com/devnet/swf.html](http://www.adobe.com/devnet/swf.html).

how exactly did you get those swf files?
There's a good chance that they are corrupted.

1) did you unpack the swfs from an archive?
(In this case it were possible they were corrupted then by a maybe not fitting unpacker.)

2) was there any Rosetta Stone swf which worked for you?
