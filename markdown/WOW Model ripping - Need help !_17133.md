- Post Title: WOW Model ripping - Need help !

Hi there,
i want to rip from World of Warcraft the full class halls/temples like the Netherlight Temple.
I am not a WOW Crack and i use/test the WOW Model Viewer but i cant find the class halls/temples.
Now i hope we have here some WOW Pro's they can help me to find and extract the full Temples.

Many thanks!

Well, you will need to get the CASC viewer, that extracts all the files from the WoW game, get xnView to be able to easy convert the blp (texture) files to png or tga, 
then find the folder that holds that hall you want, it probably is a wmo header file that holds multiple references to the other wmo files. in these wmo file you have a reference to the m2 files, which are dooadds, and if you have outside locations in that map you should be looking a the adt files.

Here is a little tutorial I did 2 years ago
