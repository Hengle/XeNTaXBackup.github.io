Hello there.

I want to extract the music from the game "PoP: Sands of Time" and it seems, that it's located in the "sound.big"-file.

I looked into the file "sound.fat" (with notepad) in the same dir and found such strange file-names:
sound/1wtrgp76.sb0
sound/amb_fx.sb0
Maybe it's an unkown sound-format ...

I'm a newbie to MultiEx, so any kind of help would be nice.

I did.
The music isn't in the "POPData.BF"-file, only some scripts (it's a 3,7 MB file). And your script doesn't support any other *.BF-files.  In addition to that is the "sound.big"-file a *.BIG-file.

Right!    Could you save only a small portion of the file, like from the beginning and 200kb or so, and attach it here? So I could have a look inside?

How can I save the beginning of a file? (sorry, as I said, I'm a newbie)

Ah, well, what you could do is open it with a Hex editor and copy/paste piece of the file to a new file. For example, with Hex Workshop from Breakpoint Software.

Ok, here is a part of the "sound.big"-file. I included the "sound.fat"-file too, maybe it's useful.

[pop_sound_big.zip](http://home.arcor.de/pedo/pop_sound_big.zip)
199KB, zipped

And thanks for the quick replies!
