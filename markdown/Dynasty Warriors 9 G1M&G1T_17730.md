drag it into exe then you can get ascii model, use blender with xnalara plugin to open it


but I want to know how you find the textures file, I got models and textures and I don't know which is correct texture for each model, how do you find them?

If only some huge fan of this game gonna make a list of these depencies for everyone else, but this is again almost impossible as you can judge.
