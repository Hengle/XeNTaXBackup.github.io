Here are the graphics files found in the DDR/DS games for PS2... 

I would like to know if it is possible to support these games?

The compressed graphic files can be downloaded here:

I think that, for extracting textures in order to do themes for PC Games, people rip 'em from an Emulator, PCSX2. Worked great for me in most cases.

Well.. The problem of using the emulator is that it is extremely slow and it doesn't work for those songs/course banners that are locked (not displayed)... 

So, it I can simply just extract out all the graphics in the files it will be easier...
