- Post Title: Help with autotext.cif in LZSS compressed

I unpacked this file from Nancy Drew 17:Legend of the Crystal Skull.
Who can give any hint or tools to uncompress this file?
I also want to know the offset of the compress data.
Thanks!

Well it is indeed compressed, but can't figure out what compression it is. There are no indications.
An uncompressed version of the file might help.

I think, in the end only debugging the exe will give you usable results.
