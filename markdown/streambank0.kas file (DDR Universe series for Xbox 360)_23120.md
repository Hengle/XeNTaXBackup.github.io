- Post Title: streambank0.kas file (DDR Universe series for Xbox 360)

It is possible to extract the streambank0.kas files (from DanceDance Revolution Universe series, Xbox 360)
1) I have extracted the file in Dragon Unpacker with HiperRipper [https://i.imgur.com/OXn3pFe.png](https://i.imgur.com/OXn3pFe.png)
2)I open in audiacity (or foobar, etc), i got this error [https://i.imgur.com/CTqbOzm.png](https://i.imgur.com/CTqbOzm.png)
3) I open the wwise_ima_adpcm, also i get this error [https://i.imgur.com/QTNu5ww.png](https://i.imgur.com/QTNu5ww.png)

How do I solve?

They are XMA1 audio, so with the files you extracted from Dragon Unpacker, just rename them to *.xma and they will play in Foobar with the vgmstream plugin.

Hello,

The extracted audio files (.wav) are in "compressed" form. You have to convert them to "uncompressed" .wav. You may use vgmstream's command-line tool. Once done with the conversion, the converted ("uncompressed" .wav) file will then be playable like any other usual .wav file.
