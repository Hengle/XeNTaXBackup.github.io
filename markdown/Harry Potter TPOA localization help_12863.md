Hi! I'm new to this and english is not my first language, so I'm sorry if I make mistakes.

As the subject says, I have kind of a problem with localizing the game. My first language is spanish, which is the language I'm trying to translate the game. The game has a spanish translation already, but it's a Europe spanish version. I'm from Latin America. Anyway, as game modding usually goes... I'm trying to do it just for fun.

There's no problem in changing the texts in the game (for now, apparently), but the problem is with the voices.

I extracted the files from the alldialog.uax file with Dragon Unpacker to look at the format and all of that, and I was able to play the files normally with VLC (some audios freeze at the middle for a moment and then continue, though) but I can't seem to find a tool to modify (or create) a .uax file that works on the game.

Dragon Unpacker extracted succesfully many of the apparent .wav files (which actually are, at least in Codec Information from VLC, BINK blank videos, with BINK audio), but when I tried to use the UnrealEd BatchImport function to compile it again, the resulting file was significantly smaller in size than the original (at least 20 MB), leading to a serial size mismatch error when I tried to open the game.

I tried other tools like the extractor from gildor.org and it extracted the file completely and the size was alright, but there were no .wav files, not even BINK files. They were .sound files (and others).

So, the question is... is there an easier way to do this and I'm not aware of it, I'm misunderstanding something or there isn't even a way to do it?...

I feel it's some really small stupid thing I'm not noticing... but try to understand me, I'm new to this. xD

Thank you for your patience!

I don't know if I'm doing something wrong or just no ones know how to help me...

Whatever is the situation, I would like to know. xD

Thanks again...
