I would love to know how to open them aswell.I tryed 4 different tools that can detect pk2 file formats but they cannot open them.Is there program that is specifically made for Star war 3 revenge of the sith ps2?

EDIT:I finally opened them but now i cannot extract the .pak files which i believe contain all the models and textures.
