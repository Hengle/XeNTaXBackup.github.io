- Post Title: Extract Umap fron Uassets?

Not sure if this is the right place to post. I've managed to get my hands on the Crisis Core Reunion uassets, textures and meshes! I want to extract the umaps from the uassets for Blender, I wasn't able to open them in UE. I also want to extract the characters with skeletons. Is there a tool to do this? The FFVIIR files came with an amazing exe tool but it doesn't work on these, I think it's because they're PC mods.

Thanks!
