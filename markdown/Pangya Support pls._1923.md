Could support for pangya be added please

I have trouble even seeing inside the .pak files properly, i know there are .dds files and .bin etc.  Would it be possible to open textures and change them

Complete Pak file Sample 3MB.

No DDS images. however i see a BUNCH of encrypted/packed
JPEG images.

whats funny is that this archive does not contain any index.
it simply starts with an image. so the index must be
stored somewhere else.

That depends on the JFIF format. Is the size not deducible from the JPG file? Then you don't need indexes.

Technically you can get the size from an JPEG image
by counting the headers and end headers to sum up to an equal
value. but then they have to parse the whole archive
when its loaded and build that index by hand as the JPEG images
has no LengthHeader. it has to be calculated.

but the jpegs in this archive is definitley packed.
they have strange truncated headers.

dont know what they are packed with though =o

Ive used the file cutter to take sample from a bigger pak file from the game (176mb) 

I did try some raw extraction program earlier, and it found wavs, dds, but unable to even open the dds files.

P.S this game is freeware, if sample is still of no use, could someone take a peak at the full pak files.

Found a mirror for the game on a foreign server

I managed to track down a unpacker /repacker exe tools. But they only work on indonesian version. Included link to these exe tools incase they help understand how to unpack.
