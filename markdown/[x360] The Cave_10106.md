Nope. Because = No files and download of full game ~ 8-9gb hardly anyone will be.

Standard for XBOX -> endian big

Ok.

This script for extract ~p files from X360 version. Man_Gfx - contain font and Rgb_Stuff contain text.

```
open FDDE "~p" 1
comtype XmemDecompress
endian big
idstring dfpf
get DUMMY long
get DUMMY long
get DUMMY long  # align?
get DUMMY long
get NAME_OFF long
get DUMMY long
get DUMMY long
get FILES long

math INFO_SIZE = FILES
math INFO_SIZE <<= 4
math INFO_OFF = NAME_OFF
math INFO_OFF -= INFO_SIZE
goto INFO_OFF

for i = 0 < FILES
    get SIZE threebyte
    get NAMEX threebyte
    get Type short
    get OFFSET threebyte
    get DUMMY byte
    get ZSIZE threebyte
    get COMTYPE byte

    savepos INFO_OFF
    math NAMEX >>= 3
    math NAMEX += NAME_OFF
    goto NAMEX
    get NAME string
    goto INFO_OFF

    math Type /= 2
    math SIZE += type
    math ZSIZE >>= 4
    math OFFSET <<= 5
    if SIZE == ZSIZE
        log NAME OFFSET SIZE 1
    else
        clog NAME OFFSET ZSIZE SIZE 1
    endif
next i
```


If you want you can use my script for easy text editing.
Unpack

```
getdstring head 0x1f
putdstring head 0x1f MEMORY_FILE
for i = 0 < 2730
getct text string 0x3d
strlen text_size text
putdstring text text_size MEMORY_FILE
putdstring "=" 1 MEMORY_FILE
savepos offset
getct text2 string 0x7b
getct text3 string 0x3b 
strlen text3_size text3
putdstring text3 text3_size MEMORY_FILE
savepos offset MEMORY_FILE
putdstring "" 2 MEMORY_FILE
putVarChr MEMORY_FILE offset 0x0D byte
math offset + 1
putVarChr MEMORY_FILE offset 0x0A byte
math offset + 1
getct dummy string 0x7d
get dummy2 byte
next i
get size asize MEMORY_FILE
log cave.txt 0x00 size MEMORY_FILE
```


Repack

```
open FDDE "txt" 1
log MEMORY_FILE 0 0
getdstring head 0x1f
putdstring head 0x1f MEMORY_FILE
getdstring head1 0x1f 1
for i = 0 < 2730
getct str string 0x7b
strlen str_size str
putdstring str str_size MEMORY_FILE
putdstring "{" 1 MEMORY_FILE
getct str2 string 0x3d
strlen str2_size str2
putdstring str2 str2_size MEMORY_FILE
putdstring "=" 1 MEMORY_FILE
getct str3 string 0x3d 1
getct str4 string 0x3d 1
getct str5 string 0x0d 1
strlen str5_size str5
putdstring str5 str5_size MEMORY_FILE
getct str6 string 0x3b
putdstring ";" 1 MEMORY_FILE
getct str7 string 0x7d
strlen str7_size str7
putdstring str7 str7_size MEMORY_FILE
putdstring "}" 1 MEMORY_FILE
next i
putdstring ";};}" 4 MEMORY_FILE
savepos offset
math offset += 0x4
putvarchr MEMORY_FILE offset 0x00 
get size asize MEMORY_FILE
log cave_enus 0x00 size MEMORY_FILE
```

For repack rename original cave_enus to cave.dat.
