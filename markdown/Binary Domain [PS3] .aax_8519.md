- Post Title: Binary Domain [PS3] .aax

We have stream.cpk (921mb)

Applying aluigi's CRI CPK bms script to it gets us a collection of other CPK files (with proper names).
Using CPK script again [on them] results in .aax files.

I tried AAX2ADX and that didn't work. 
Foobar2000 with vgmstream plugin also didn't support these AAXs.
XBMC which also suppose to be able to play them failed to do so.

Uploaded one of the files - theme_staffroll.cpk (9mb), extracted from stream.cpk

Please check this out.

it's not a AAX file, but a ADX2 file (see the HCA header on the file)
As far as i know, there is no way to play it yet (except with the new CRI SDK )

cheers

There are many generic data rippers out there that can extract certain audio or graphic formats out of raw game files. 
But the point here is that ADX2 is a fairly new variation of ADX format which has not been extensively researched yet, and no public tools with for its support had been released yet.

No, it is not a variation, it is a all new encoding format and has little to nothing in common with its adpcm ADX predecessor.

Oh, I know for a fact that is has nothing to do with ADX ADPCM. It's like an MPEG mutation like AHX.
