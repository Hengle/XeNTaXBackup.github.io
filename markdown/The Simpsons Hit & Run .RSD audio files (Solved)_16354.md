- Post Title: The Simpsons Hit & Run .RSD audio files (Solved)

Hello there.

I'm in the process of compiling audio of The Simpsons Hit & Run until I have reach an issue.
The files from which I found the audio are in a .RSD format, and I cannot find an answer to extract them and convert them to .WAV format. (There's PSound, but it creates too many duplicates to spend my time deleting them).

I have attached a sample for anyone to analyze it.
If anyone could provide a solution for this dilemma I'm forever grateful for your help.  
Thank you for your time and helpfulness.

My apologies for the delayed response, but I wanted to say thank you so much for your help!

The tool works like a charm, and I'm going to be really busy converting all those sounds.

Thank you again for your assistance!
