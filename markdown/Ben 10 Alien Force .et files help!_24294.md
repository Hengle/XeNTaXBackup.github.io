I only got the vertices data, but I don't have the triangles, so is there anyway to get Jetray and Spidermonkey in their full models?

Mind to show to vertices? I won't do all the work - my usual job is to show the first sub mesh of one sample.

(In some rare cases where I'm interested in the models myself I create some Make_obj (or Make_H2O) project. That's the way it goes and I won't change it.  )

Maybe face indices for the head only (0x94d5, 442 vertices) are simply to track?

The update for the et files are here! [https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/ ... _R5dEUPGXa](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1UeYQHdYsEJ8Yw4C6DZy2nD_R5dEUPGXa)
Enjoy these, but first, do Max.et then Ben.et?
Note: Ben's vertices count is 3010, the padding is 10, and the offset is 8405
