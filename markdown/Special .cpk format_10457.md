- Post Title: Special .cpk format

Hi and good evening,

I have been tinkering with something and suddenly came across a "un-decryptable" (maybe) .cpk format.

I tried various tools such as utf_tab, utf_tab_special, cpk_unpack, cripackedfilemaker (console and gui), quickbms cpk.bms script by sir_luigi but to no avail. Made modifications to some sources but failed.

It seems that it only has ITOC, no main TOC they say, but I think it has a UTF table.

Can someone help me?, If memory preserves it's from "Mana Khemia 2 Portable +", Thank you in advanced

Here is the sample made with filecutter:

I'm in the same boat, for another game but I think the solution lies in [this thread](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=21&t=5137).
