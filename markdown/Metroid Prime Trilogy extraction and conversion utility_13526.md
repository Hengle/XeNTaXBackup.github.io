- Post Title: Metroid Prime Trilogy extraction and conversion utility

A fellow C++ developer and I have been working on a tool that converts many of the formats into usable formats:

STRG, and SCAN files are converted to YAML
TXTR files are converted to PNG
CMDL, MREA, ANCS, MAPA, and MLVL are all converted into Blender projects

With support for the rest of the formats definitely in the works.

Very nice tool. Quick question though,
Do you know where the effects for the morphball in MP1 are? I'm talking about the blue, green, and red effect that shows up inside it. I can only ever find the blue one.

Those are stored in PART, and ELSC files which are FX scripts that describe particle systems.
