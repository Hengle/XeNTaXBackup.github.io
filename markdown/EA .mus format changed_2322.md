- Post Title: EA .mus format changed?

Hi all,

I suppose you probably won't know the answer to my question but there's no harm in trying, so here goes. 

Does anyone know if the format of EA's .mus format changed recently (namely the compression/decompression scheme)? Valery Anisimovsky described that format several years ago (in the times of NFS 5, NHL 2k, etc.), but I have been wondering if any significant changes in the (de)compression scheme occurred as of late. [Here](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?t=2041) is a quote of Valery's original description.

I've been trying to create my own extractor for the music in NFS Carbon. I think I can correctly handle the file structure but I fall short in the area of decompression.  I know there is an extractor for NFS Most Wanted floating around that can handle NFSC, but I think it does that with dubious quality.

So, if anyone knows the answer, please let me know. Thanks.

Definitely. The sample is in EA's .asf format and it was extracted using my own extractor.

I just want to know if Valery's old description still applies to Carbon. As I said in my original post, I can handle extraction without any problems but when I attempt to decompress the files, the results are far from playable.

If the (de)compression scheme is the same, it would mean that there is a problem in my implementation, but if there were changes, well... then I'm lost, unless you (or somebody else) can provide with information on what's changed. 

Thanks.

And is there a description of the algorithm the tool you used uses? I'm interested in just that, the (de)compression algorithm.

Thought id bump this but apparently why does the ps3 version of carbon don't convert for me?
