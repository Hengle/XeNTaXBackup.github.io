- Post Title: Nintendo 3DS File Format

Question, is there already a way to extract the 3ds file format from the Nintendo 3DS Dump Files?

I would like to get my hands on the Castlevania - Lords Of Shadow - Mirror Of Fate models, if possible! 
I have the real game, I have the dump of it, but I don't seem to find anything to open/convert/extract it... 

anyone ?

Thnx in advance

T.

There is no way to extract 3ds roms.
Someone needs to release a kernel exploit to the public so the decryption key can be found.
