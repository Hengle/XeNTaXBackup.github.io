- Post Title: The Darkness 2 models?

Hello!

I was trying to open the models from this game,then I extracted the B.Misc.cache using a script found here [viewtopic.php?f=10&t=8120&hilit=the+darkness&start=0](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=8120&hilit=the+darkness&start=0) ,but the models are in .fbx format(maybe) and my 3DSMax can't open them.
I attached a sample file with some .fbx files.

thanks!!

Please read the new rules of the site bifore post. Sample files are not allowed anymore, if somebody is interested will pm you the link for your files. Anyway even if the format name is .fbx, It's completely different from the typical fbx format (there are not fbx header in them.)
