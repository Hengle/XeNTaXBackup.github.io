- Post Title: Need help regarding 3D models I extracted

Hi, everyone!

Recently I got into extracting models and playing with their textures, importing them in XPS, etc.

However, one model, in particular, seems to be causing trouble for me. I exported it in FBX and then into DAE file, but for some reason, it appears broken. Can someone take a look and tell me if it's fixable?

Broken character example:


Normal character example:


Here is the file with FBX and DAE output and also another one of a different character, just in case you need to compare something.

I am using command line and some tools that I found on the internet.

Have you tried using Noesis or Blender or 3ds Max?

Yeah, you can try it if you want as well. Files are in the original post. I don't know if I'm doing something wrong.

Try exporting as something else, obj maybe? What are you using to export anyway? Could be some export settings possible as well. Or could also try welding the vertices at a low threshold in Max before export or something too, not 100% sure.
