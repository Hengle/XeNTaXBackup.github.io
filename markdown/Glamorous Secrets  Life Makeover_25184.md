- Post Title: Glamorous Secrets / Life Makeover

As this is a separate game, I didn't want to add this to the Dragon Raja thread. 

Glamorous Secrets just had it's first test for the SEA version (renamed Life Makeover) and I was lucky enough to get in. This game is also made by Archosaur, and based on a post on Gildor ([https://www.gildor.org/smf/index.php/topic,7976.0.html](https://www.gildor.org/smf/index.php/topic,7976.0.html)) uses the exact same method to extract the files as DR from here ([viewtopic.php?f=16&t=21095](https://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=21095)) 

When it comes to textures, I'm having a bit of an issue. Most, if not all textures, seem to crash umodel, so I decided to try exporting them via Noesis instead. Given that the game is also made by Archosaur, I tried using the Python script from Bigchill's DR post to try and view and export what I need, but nothing is getting exported and the file sizes for most everything is incredibly small - [https://i.imgur.com/P4z2UOC.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/P4z2UOC.jpg). 

Here are my files - For convenience, I separated a random shoe. It looks like models are listed under "loli" in player models, and the textures are listed separately under "female" player models - [https://mega.nz/folder/6AAWSZbA#K7BLh8__ffplt-69MaCGrA](https://mega.nz/folder/6AAWSZbA#K7BLh8__ffplt-69MaCGrA)

I feel like I am -so close- to getting what I need, so any and all help is greatly appreciated. c: If you need additional information, let me know and I can try and get it for you!

Hello, Can I use Umodel to open error reporting? Have you solved your normal map output problem?

I tried ripping LM, but without success.
I unpacked png archive & dat archives, merged them in one folder - had no errors.
But when I open everything in Noesis or Umodel - I have no previews, cant export anything.
What could have went wrong?
