- Post Title: QuickBMS  extractor and reimporter

hey guys im having a problem with importing the files back to the the .dat of the lego harry potter (i am an extreme noob at this)

im new to re injecting files to there org file im reading the small guide on how to inject it but it doesn't make any since to me 

i open re import  and i read the code im suppose  to use "quickbms -w -r script.bms archive.pak output_folder"
but when i re import no command line comes up to type anything in and i when i type it in quickbms i get an error most likey becuase im using the extractor bms for the game but i don't know what bms i will be using to import the files back in then i import the main file then the output folder so im lost where is this "script" and how do i import the files i modded ?

you did nothing wrong, but ttgames.bms is not valid for the reimport operations because the lz2k algorithm is not supported in recompression mode and the archives use chunks
