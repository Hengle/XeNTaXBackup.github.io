- Post Title: Kuro no Kiseki .mdl format

Hi! I have extracted the game "The Legend of Heroes: Kuro no Kiseki" (PS4 version), the textures are in .gnf format and noesis can load them just fine.
However, the 3D models are in .mdl format and noesis can't load them ("Detected file type: Unknown").
Samples: <removed>

I hope someone would take a glance. Thanks in advance!

Edit: There're some json files that might related to bones so I added them to the samples. Also added some animation samples.

I already made some tools, search for "Falcom 3D texture and model dumps"

Last time I saw the 3D models of Kuro no Kiseki on your website (ghpages) but I thought those were ripped because they were missing some meshes of left hand. Now that I see your script, thank you so much!
