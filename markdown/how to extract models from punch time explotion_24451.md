Man, you need a QuickBMS script of the models.
Let me help you out with a starting point.
First you need QuickBMS and the BMS for the models.
Secondly, open QuickBMS.exe then search for CartoonNetwork.
Thirdly, you will find the BMS script, press Enter on it.
And last of all, search a c_(characternamehere).ps3 file, but my example would be: "c_kevin.ps3" or "c_kevin_color.ps3"
Now save, and BOOM, you get a model with a .3ds format!
