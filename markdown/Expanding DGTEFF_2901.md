- Post Title: Expanding DGTEFF

I've been thinking recently (always a dangerous activity), specifically about an idea I'd been kicking around for a few months now - namely, writing up a version of the DGTEFF for savegame formats. As I thought on this idea, it occured to me, why not write up guides on other types of formats, such as audio files, and even stuff like encrytion? Of course, much of the stuff I wouldn't be able to write about, due to a lack of knowledge, but as I continued on this train of thought, I realized that separate guides wouldn't be nearly so useful as one large, sectioned guide. The DGTEFF is already like this in a way, but in many aspects it only skims the surface. So, with it being on the wiki now, I realized that it would be far easier to rearrange and expand it than to start all-new guides. Over time, each section (e.g. data types, encryption, etc.) could be broken off into its own sub-guide; navigation between them would be easy enough to provide. And given that it would be on the wiki, future expansion and updates would be very simple, and any number of examples could be provided.

I'm sure that someone else could have posited this much better and more clearly than I, but please don't hold it against me.  Anyone have any thoughts on the matter?

Yes, I do think it is a good idea to expand the Definitive Guide to er.. even More Definitive...  When certain types (Encryption, Save game, Graphics formats) become large enough they could become a separate Chapter. The Guide would then evolve to the Final Word.

Another benefit that I forgot to mention to developing and expanding the DGTEFF further versus writing all-new guides is that the various sections of the DGTEFF can refer to each other; for example, if I'm talking about compression, and I bring up data formats, I can just refer you to the data format section of the DGTEFF, rather than having to write up a completely new section on it, or at the very least, copying the section from the DGTEFF for a seperate guide.

Could also benefit the new scripting language Mr.M and I discussed earlier
