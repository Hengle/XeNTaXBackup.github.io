Hello.
I am now trying to extract a Tales of Asteria audio file.
However, their .ogg files are encrypted and cannot be opened.
Is there a solution?
I can extract Tales of the Rays sounds well, but Tales of Asteria is can`t.

Hi try using foobar2000 + vgmstream component. You may need to rename to "*.logg"), but i think it plays encrypted oggs ok:

thanks for your reply.
But I already tried it.
"Unable to open item for playback (Unsupported format or corrupted file)"
Are these ogg files related to cocos2d-x?
