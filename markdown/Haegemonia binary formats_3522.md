- Post Title: Haegemonia binary formats

Hi all,
there are these games:
Haegemonia - Legions of Iron
Haegemonia - The Solon Heritage

While the modding tools have been released, they do not include any tools to decompile/extract the binary files.
I would like to be able to decompile the binary INF files to plain text INF files (like the Haegemonia viewer does), but from command line.
Furthermore - and this is the more important one since there are not tools for this at all - I would need a tool to extract the BMOD files.
I found a bug and since there is no official support for this game anymore, I would like to take a look at the contents of a BMOD file, edit and pack them back.

I attached the set of BMOD files that I need to unpack, edit and repack.
Thank you.

These files contain models and animations.
Are you sure they contain more than that?

No, I am not sure - since I cannot unpack them.
I am hoping there there would be some encrypted INF files that I can decode using the Haegemonia Explorer.
I guess there should be some more than just models and anims in there, because other than the BMODs there are only DDS textures in the .\Haegemonia - Legions of Iron\GFX\Interface\Research directory.
I would like to fix the bug where the research list is cut off in higher resolutions (font is too big to list all research items).
