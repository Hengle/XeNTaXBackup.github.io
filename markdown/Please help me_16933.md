- Post Title: Please help me

Hi everyone,

New to the forum, and pretty desperate, thought I would just ask before giving up.

Please, before pointing me to obvious sections of the forum, I have read and read and looked for answers all over, but I'm just not getting this right.

I'm trying to extract image files from Cars: Fast as Lightning.

ALL I basically want, are the track files and backgrounds of the various tracks. Not interested in creating 3d models, per se (I'm planning to make a poster for my little boy with it). Also not interested in the car models, I won't be using that at all.

I just can't get the TGA and BDAE files loaded, some I've managed (unfortunately it's not what I'm looking for), but others I have not (and I suspect those files are the very ones I AM looking for, just judging by the filenames). I have tried QuickBms, Max 3ds, PVRTexTool, and all the other tools that have been mentioned with regard to these type of files... I just don't know what to do anymore.

Please help a desperate momma...

Thanking you kindly and very hopeful for some assistance, please.
