- Post Title: Unluac.NET > .NET Lua Decompiler!

So I've been working on a project that relies heavily on the functionality of [Unluac](http://sourceforge.net/projects/unluac/). Unfortunately, it is written in Java and can only be operated via command line. Since C# is very much like Java, I set out to rewrite Unluac using the power of the .NET Framework.

In less than 10 days (non-consecutively), I have successfully rewritten Unluac!

You can find the source [here](https://bitbucket.org/CarLuver69/unluacnet). Unless noted otherwise, it is to be considered a work-in-progress.

Unluac.NET comes in the form of a DLL file you can incorporate into your programs. I have a simple console "demo" based on the original Unluac, but it's not in my repository at the moment.

Hope some of you find this useful! Enjoy!

I've updated Unluac.NET to incorporate changes made to the original Unluac. I've also added a simple command line decompiler to the project that will suit your basic needs.

This [online decompiler](http://decompiler.com/) supports both Luac and .NET decompilation.
