- Post Title: Unable to load ealayer3.dll

I'm getting this error on Frosty Editor after I try to open NewWaveAsset files of Need For Speed Heat. Happens while opening some audio files of Rivals as well.

Unable to load DLL '../thirdparty/ealayer3.dll': The specified module could not be found. (Exception from HRESULT: 0x8007007E)

   at SoundEditorPlugin.EALayer3.Decode(Byte[] buffer, Int32 length, AudioCallback callback)

Almost installed and tried everything. Thank you.

Same problem for me editing Mass Effect Andromeda. Your post was three months ago. Did you find a solution?

Looks like it was intended in some systems. They announced this bug is gonna be fixed in next version.
