- Post Title: Star Wars The Old Republic Noesis .Tor Model location?

Help will be appreciated! (don't eat me I'm a noob) 

So I've been rummaging around opened/extracted .Tor files in Noesis and I can't seem to find the Dread Master models do y'all know which .Tor file they're all located in?

Love Calphy

It has been a while since you posted this, so probably you already find out where to look. In case you didn't, this website shows all the NPC's in game and the name and location of it's 3d models.
