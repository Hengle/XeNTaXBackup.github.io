- Post Title: Put custom titatron in SVR 011

Hi everybody,

I've create a titatron with my highlight real in the game and when you open it with modio, the file got extension .enc! 

So i wonder if there's any program that can open it and convert it to mepg or avi. It can be good to import them in adobe premiere, edit them like we want and import them back into the game!

I'm not an expert, so i don't know if this is possible?
