[ARchive_neXt](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=6617) gives you the ability to visually explore the contents of Ubisoft's forge files, and export image and model files in a variety of formats.

The current version works with all Assassin's Creed and Prince of Persia games that use the forge format.  The next release will also work with For Honor, Ghost Recon:Wildlands, and Rainbow Six Siege.
