I manged to get Ninjaripper to launch it, however you will not get past the logos.
What I did was add force_start at the end of the of the shortcuts target, so there has to be a way around this because I don't think using the launcher will work in anyway as the launcher uses 32-bit, but the game will default to 64-bit on launch. I'm sure there's a way to lock it to the 32-bit exe, but I have no idea how to do that as of now.
I don't have a 32-bit OS to test to see if running ninjaripper with the launcher will work on the actual games exe, but I am doubtful. There must be a way to provide your login details in the shortcut target.

From the character creator's description (on the link you gave) it says:
"you can save and export the character file and later import it in the closed beta client or final game".

Did you save a character file?
Is it encrypted?

black desert meshes are nice ...yet most details are in the huge textures inside them.
