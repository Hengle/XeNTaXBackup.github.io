- Post Title: GTR Evolution .GCF files

Can someone please make a plugin for MultiEX that can handle GTR Evolution (by SimBin) .GCF files?

I tried the Monopoly extractor for .GCF files, but it doesn't work on the GTR Evolution files (I didn't think it would, but I'm desperate). 

I really want to make a mod for the cars in this game and the only huge archives are all .GCF format. The smallest of the .GCF files in the game's directory is 3 MB (if a sample file is needed for development).

Thank you for any help in this matter.

Anyone? I'd love to mod this, but I don't know the first thing about figuring out the file format.

for the GCF archives of Steam you need to use GCFScape:

remember that the games developed by Simbin have encrypted files so if you want to "play" (modding) with the GMT files of the game you need to decrypt them first:

Thanks for the info, I'll take a look at it.
