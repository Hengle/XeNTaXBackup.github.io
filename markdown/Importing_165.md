I'm trying to import a new mp3 into a *.BIG file directory thing, but the import option is always greyed out, and a big 'X' is over the icon. Am I unable to alter the directory while it's in BIG format? How do I uncompress and then recompress the directory if this is the case? 
Thank you-

Well, yes, if this is the case, then this format is not supported for file importation. I can always have a look at the format.
