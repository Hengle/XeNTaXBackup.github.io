- Post Title: Yakuza 1 OME file?

Hello,

I decided to decompress the avlz file in PLAYER0.DAT and got this file.

I am hoping someone in here knows/can find out what this file is? A model, an animation, or something else?

Chrono Cross remaster also has these files.
We need to find the original software used to open these 3D models for editing.

woah thats me i figured it out
anyways
i know this is an old post but
if you join the yakuza modding community on discord and look in the wip-tools/tools channel(idk which one), there'll be an ome noesis script.
