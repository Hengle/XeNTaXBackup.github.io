- Post Title: [REQ] Ship Simulator Models [2008, Extremes, European]

Hello, everyone.

I'm new here, and as far as 3D models, I'm interested in the ships.
I would like to make a request or either learn how to rip some of these from the simulators made by VSTEP so that I can use them to port to another simulator.

There were a group of models from the three ship simulators 2008, Extremes and European that I would like to extract from the game.
I don't necessarily know how to go about doing this myself, so I would require some assistance as to the process of model extraction.

Beginning with Ship Simulator 2008, there were two DLC content addons made for the game in which I would like to extract the models of.

Here are two images of the ships:


The DLC content packs for the ships can be downloaded here:

For Ship Simulator Extremes, there are three models I would like to extract.
The Big Apple II is part of the Ferries Addon pack which is available for purchase on ShipSim's website.


Another is an LNG tanker called Ocean Prince, and comes with the base game.


Finally, here is the Red Eagle, which a car ferry that is available as a free DLC pack addon for the simulator.


As far as models for European Ship Simulator, I'm only interested in the cruise ship, which looks like this:


If anyone is able or willing to guide or walk me through the process of extracting models from these games in assistance, I would really, really appreciate it and it would be very helpful.

Thank you for your help.

That's probably what I would need to do then—use a 3D ripping application.

I visited a game model website yesterday which had a section with about 12 models from Ship Simulator 2006. I do believe that if these models were ripped from the game with whichever program they used to achieve them, that the very same program should not have any difficulties achieving the game data/models from the newer simulators, since all of VSTEP's simulators use the QuestViewer/Quest3D game engine. If the models were successfully extracted from Ship Simulator 2006, however, wouldn't that mean that there was a more than likely chance that they weren't encrypted? As far as their newer simulators, I don't know if that aspect has been changed for those models, though.

You can visit the website which has those 12 Ship Simulator 2006 models here:

Do you have any suggestions as to which 3D model ripper I should use to try to attempt to extract the models from these simulators?

Well I've just downloaded three separate model ripping programs, and none of them worked to any avail.

I first downloaded 3D Ripper in hopes of at least managing to obtain the one cruise ship model from ESS, but installing the program, hooking it to ess.exe and then running the application appeared to have done nothing, since pressing the capture button in 3D Ripper did absolutely nothing as well. I closed ess.exe and then reopened it via 3D Ripper, and again, pressing the rip button did absolutely nothing—no files being written, or even captured.

When I downloaded Ninja Ripper to try the process again—again, hooking it to the game's executable and running to program caused the game to load successfully, but the program to actually crash (if it wasn't intended to) since the process disappeared from the Task Manager list.

And finally, I downloaded RenderDoc—another 3D model ripping program, and once again, hooked the game's .exe to the program and then ran it. The program remained fine, however the game mysteriously began crashing every time I ran it through RenderDoc, and immediately ceased when I closed RenderDoc and ran the game normally.

At this point, you may be right about me being out of luck, due to the difficulty of extracting models from European Ship Simulator.
I still wonder how it was able to be done with models from Ship Simulator 2006, however.

Do you or does anyone else have any additional suggestions for what I should—could do?
Apparently I wasn't even able to make it past step 3 or 4, 'ripping' the model.
