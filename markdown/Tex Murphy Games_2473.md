Extract the movies as what? they are specialized video files, that allow for transparency. They would have to be extracted and converted.

Extract the files first off thats the hard part. Converting should be the easy part.

Well normally it's the other way around, extracting them shouldn't be too hard, but converting is hard (except you are a pro in movie formats and converters)

IIRC the Tex Murphy games use the same file format as the other Access games. If that's the case, I already have an extractor. I'll try to dig up my game CDs and see what I can do.
