- Post Title: Blurayguids.map file table with another file, .farc? (PS3)

The game LittleBigPlanet has a data archive named data.farc, which is where all the game data's stored, but then there's another file named blurayguids.map that has every game filename and directory in it, but no data. My goal is to possibly use blurayguids.map to get the files out of data.farc?? I don't know exactly how ps3 games work, however.

[https://dl.dropbox.com/u/66564653/blurayguids.txt](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/66564653/blurayguids.txt) <blurayguids.map converted to .txt for viewing via web browser
I don't have data.farc with me right now, but I can go and get it if necessary.

any ideas on how I could use blurayguids.map to get the files out of data.farc?

blurayguids.txt seems only filelist that are present. For data.farc filelist data.sdat (Encrypted). Game named Little Big Planet ?

blurayguids.txt is just blurayguids.map - just with a renamed extension so it can be viewed via web browser.

The game's Little Big Planet 1, not 2. I think the filetypes are the same for both games though.

I'd put a data.farc sample but I don't have one on hand at the moment. 

I know for sure there's no filenames in there, the last time I checked. All the filenames are in blurayguids and not data.farc.

I now have access to the file so I can post it or PM it, or whatever else if needed.

You know that friend, the way you want.
If you have a ps3 unlocked I'll show you how to do it yourself.

I don't have a jailbroken ps3 sadly, I'm looking into buying one so I can do stuff like this.

is it still against the rules to link to a sample? if so, I can PM littlebigplanet 2's farc (same exact type as lbp1, only one I have access to) if needed.
