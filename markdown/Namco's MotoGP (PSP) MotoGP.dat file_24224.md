Hello, I'm trying to figure out how to unpack & repack or at least see what's inside the file (MotoGP.dat), I've been making mods for this game since a few years ago and still struggling to find a way to unpack this file, any help would be appreciated

Sample file: [https://www.mediafire.com/file/dgy5l8ed ... t.rar/file](https://www.mediafire.com/file/dgy5l8ediyjgsjk/MOTOGP+dat.rar/file)
