- Post Title: [PS2 DISC] Extracting Fonts/Images/Textures from MGS3

I'm currently hunting through code on the MGS3 disc looking for a font file or the stock image used for the [ CALL ] button that appears when you're getting a call, for a personal project.

I am completely inexperienced in this field thus I am requesting assistance via this forum.

What files would these font files/stock images be located in and what program can I use to extract or obtain them?

The file structure is like this on the disc:
...D:/
NETDOWN.ELF
SLES_820.13
SYSTEM.CNF
.../ABC/
ABC.DAT
IOPRP271.IMG
MODULE.IPK
PLD.IRX
STAGE.DAT
VOX.DAT
.../LICENSE/
LIBEENT.TXT
.../MGS/
BGM.DAT
CODEC.DAT
DEMO.DAT
MOVIE.DAT
SLOT.DAT
STAGE.DAT
VOX.DAT
.../MODULES/
DEV9.IRX
DNAS300.IMG
IOPRP300.IMG
MODULE.IPK
NETMOD.IPK
PLD.IRX
USBMOD.IPK
