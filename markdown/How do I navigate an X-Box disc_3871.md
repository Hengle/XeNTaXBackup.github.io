- Post Title: How do I navigate an X-Box disc?

I'm sure it's been answered somewhere here, but sifting through loads and loads of old posts to find it do not appeal to me.

I insert an X-Box game into my DVD drive, and just get a video file basically telling me to play the disc on an actual X-Box. (shrug)
How do I get to the actual goodies on the disc?

So far as I seem to understand about XBOX backups ect ect, is that only CERTAIN DVD drives read xbox disks propperly.

Try using Craxtion, its a program that will read the disc in the drive and then rip it to your hard drive... (there is NO way from what I know to actually read the disc 100% whilst its in your drive).

Once its ripped just use Craxtion again to extract the files from inside the ISO you just made.

On another note:

You posted this just as I was having a similar Problem...so my drive doesnt read xbox discs, so I used my girlfriends PC to rip my Ninja Gaiden II disc to an ISO. Im unable to open or extract the ISO on my system which is odd... as its a 7gig ISO but inside are only the normal files that a CD drive would see, there is no xnb file (the file NEEDED in order to extract or even read an xbox game correctly).

My girlfriend went away for a week so now im a bit screwed because I cant RE-RIP the disc (incase I did it wrong the 1st time).

So Yeah... im stuck too basically, so if anyone can advise anything id really appreciate that.

I attach a nice program to browse a iso xbox360, yes you can extract data  
Maybe helps with a normal xbox

so far i never tried xbox , this topic cause curiosity for asking an question , why a great game like Ninja Gaiden don't have a pc version ?
i believed that when a giant company develop a game , it release it in all platforms ...
if you experienced xbox the graphic power of it , is lower or higher than a 512mb pc videocard ?
anyway is there any news for releasing Ninja Gaiden on pc ?

Ninja gaiden... on a keyboard...would be fucking stupid...

Not to mention, consoles cant keep up with it propperly half the time so most peoples PC's wouldnt be able to either, unless they have a good PC or custom made one, which most people dont.

There will NOT be a ninja gaiden game on PC aside from emulation, the 1st one is just too old now and the 2nd one is a real console type of game really...

Besides, most people suck at ninja gaiden (Will never...understand why...) with a controller, they will be worse with a keyboard, not to mention most people would just use the xbox controller anyways.
