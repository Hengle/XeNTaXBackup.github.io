How can I extract the videos from DDR Extreme (PS2)? It's in a .bin format.

Thanks

If it's a PS2 game, then most likely videos are in PSS format.

So use PSS Cutter. Just drag/drop a file containing videos and it will rip them. No real filenames though.

Woulen't matter if it's import or not, if it uses PSS the result would be the same. In this case it might be SFD video instead.
Try Cube Media Player. Scan the files that suppose to have videos. "File" > "Scan file..."
Usually takes forever if the file is large (or if scanning the ISO), so don't be surprised.

When I scan the whole ISO I get nothing. When I scan the .bin file i get a mpeg error. =/
