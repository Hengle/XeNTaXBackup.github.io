- Post Title: Filecutter problems

Hello

Ok, I have a weird feeling I'll make a complete fool out of myself here as so many others seem to be able to use the Filecutter without any probs. I'm guessing I'm either doing something wrong (like missed something bloody obvious) or there might be some local problem with my computer.

I did a search for Filecutter on the forums but didn't come up with anything related (another thing indicating I'm the problem)...so here goes:

I select the file to split (no problem) and in the "Give a name for the packed file" field it seems to set a default of the original name plus a .zip extension (still no problem).

However, when I press the "Go!" button I get a message labeled "cutter" which states: "429 MexZip ActiveX component can't create object"

At this exact point, I can see a folder being created in the destination folder called "pak" which in turn contains 2 files called "head.bin" and "tail.bin".

However, when I press the "OK" button on the error message dialogue, this "pak" folder (and it's content) dissapears.

At this moment a new dialogue pops up labeled "Success" and stating: "Your file: (drive):\(folder)\(file.zip) was created!"

Pressing ok on this dialogue makes it go away...and that's it. No files or snippets remaining anywhere.

Well, let me have it...I can take it. Tell me I'm a complete idiot and I missed this or that. I'm prepared for the worst.  

Cheers

That's weird. You installed the latest version of MexCom and all?

EDIT : Download the cutter again. Should now also have a dll. And then try once more.

Did as you say but the problem still remains. I'm getting more and more convinced it's some sort of local problem at my end. Will investigate further and report back if I locate the problem in case someone else might experience the same thing.

Thank's for your help mate.

Cheers

If you have Java installed (or if you have used Game Extractor before) then you can use my file cutter ( [http://www.watto.org/extract/download/cutter.zip](http://www.watto.org/extract/download/cutter.zip) ) - it does the same thing as Mr Mouses File Cutter and will help you out in the short term.

Yes, but that won't solve the problem.

hehe yeah I know it doesn't solve the problem, but if their main goal is to cut some archives for us to look at, then its better to have a different file cutter than nothing at all. (at least thats the way I look at it.)

Hello friendsofwatto 

Thank's for the file, will try it out.

I'm pretty convinced it's a local problem, but thank you both for your help...much appreciated.  

Cheers
