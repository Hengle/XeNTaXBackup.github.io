Here is a file from the demo Jack Keane und das Auge des Schicksals.
[german.bin](http://www.mediafire.com/download.php?7hiwf1165dh00kq)
Does anyone know how to decompile and recompile the file type.  
Thank you in advance for your answers (even if it is negative)

I try the demo, and when i change something in the bin file with hex editor (same length), and pack back to the zip, all text disappear.

Look this file. I'm making a script for reimport.

Text_Jack2_german file is a text extraction in the file german.bin.
Could you tell us a little about your script reimportation?

Here's the final version of the English text. (previous was a nuke)
I ask to try again to make reimporter again.

Jack Keane The Fire Within is based on the same engine as Blood Knights.
[Blood Knights string .bin File](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=11010)

Ekey: Could you, please, change the Jack Keane's file as you did for the Blood Knights because it's different?

Swuforce: Your programs for Blood Knights work perfectly with Jack Keane The Fire Within (english.bin).

Thank you both.
