Model file data, and I found this game very similar to another game, can also use a script file to import models. Here are sample files and links [viewtopic.php?f=16&t=12196&p=100368#p100368](http://Forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=12196&p=100368#p100368)

Hi

Here is importer for models from this game.
It requires Blender249 and Python 26

Steps (Vista users) or [viewtopic.php?p=101616#p101616](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?p=101616#p101616):
1.unpack importer
2.run Blender249.blend
3.in Blender Text Window press alt+p and select model or anim file

Updated 2015-01-06:

Updated 2014-12-31:

It supports only geometry. No uv, weighting, animation or skeleton.
Geometry can take from model files. Sometimes can from anim files. 
I stopped working on this format , because i can't import textures. They have unknow format for me.

Steps (Vista users) or viewtopic.php?p=101616#p101616:
1.unpack importer
2.run Blender249.blend
3.in Blender Text Window press alt+p and select model or anim fileSo Cool, Thank you, my friend, the script runs perfectly, thank you again. Unfortunately textures have not been declassified, hoping to decrypt the textures together, make this model even more perfect

.anim files are assumed not to be supported by the script (may depend on their version?)
I checked an anim that is not recognized but contains a promissing point cloud (no keyframes, no bones):

So glad someone replyied , thank you! 
I dont know weather your are talking about normal .anim file(which can open by maya), or 斗战神.anim files.  you said its not supported by script, but Szkaradek123's title of the tool is "[.model][.anim]", I think he means .anim file are allowed. 
I put the sample of the model and the related .anim file below, can you help me try to open it agian?  Thanks a lot ~~

I may be wrong, of course (as always) but I don't see any anims handled by this script.

What you get is a skinned mesh and a skeleton from the .model file.
And for the .anim file a table created from the fileFormatParser()
using
print '-'*n,type,size,unk,name,g.tell()

Having a look at an anim file you could give it some structure, I marked the timeline values
for run.anim:  0, 33, 66, 100, 133, 166, ... [milliseconds]
.

That's really cool ! you are far away from me , I know poor about codes.  I also got problems with .texture files, there is a script called "chuf.bms" for quickbms, a way for extracting is already there"comtype lzma_dynamic",but when open the texture file, I cant even regonize where is the body of the file ,where is the filename or something should be cut. Wish you can help me ~

.texture file adress:[https://drive.google.com/open?id=1jHuFt ... 13im31zbef](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1jHuFtWG3tHcwmWkIkMouhE13im31zbef)

dunno. Try out TextureFinder (search forum).
pet002.texture seems to come close to DXT1a or BC1 UNORM.

Anyway，thank you， @shakotay2.

斗战神 .anim is still an encypted file with head string"chuf". Maybe it needs to be extracted before open. 

Sad another game "lost ark" cant find a way to extract too，after searching zenhax and xentax  (*>﹏<*)

asura ol 斗战神 Is a good game, have script that can extract the VFS file, you can update the script, download links http://zenhax.com/viewtopic.php
Hello rayking! I'm trying to unpack the game with the script but I'm having the problem that appears here [https://zenhax.com/viewtopic.php?f=13&t=12656&hilit=dzs](https://zenhax.com/viewtopic.php?f=13&t=12656&hilit=dzs), so I need to rename each file before unpack, I tried with around 20 codepages values but still the same problem, is there any way you can upload your old client please? or you know how to bypass this issue?. Thanks
