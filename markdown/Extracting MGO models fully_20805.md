- Post Title: Extracting MGO models fully?

So I've got the FMDL Studio, and practically Every tool you can possibly imagine for MGS5 extraction. I thought it impossible, but this is what I have so far, in recreating my MGO Character, in Unity

My character: [https://i.gyazo.com/e50e49a88cadd1aa93d ... feec1d.png](https://i.gyazo.com/e50e49a88cadd1aa93dcdd487bfeec1d.png) [https://i.gyazo.com/1a3bb38f7222c41a13d ... 0e6898.jpg](https://i.gyazo.com/1a3bb38f7222c41a13ddf83dd30e6898.jpg)

My character so far in Unity: [https://i.gyazo.com/5c9077b941ca21fad9c ... e3904c.png](https://i.gyazo.com/5c9077b941ca21fad9c990991de3904c.png)

As you can see, My MGO Character looks pretty awful in Unity so far. I'm missing many things, one being what seems like a Head texture that actually looks like it's supposed to have beard, and head hair (instead of looking shaven under), And I'm missing the eyebrow textures. I'd also like to find the BDU, and Vest model, pictured in the second screenshot, if possible ^^

 So I reach out to you, Xentax. Can you help me? Simply just file directories for the MGO Models and textures would be the biggest help. (By the I mean listing which ftex is what texture, and which fpk is what model. Thanks in advance for, Really, Any info you can give me! Thanks in advance~ ^^)
