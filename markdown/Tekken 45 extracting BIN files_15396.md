I am newbie. I need to extract tekken 4/5/6 files. i know about xbdecmproseeion, Ravioli game tools and quickbms. I've googled everything and have some progress. I've used clear PS2 and PS3 files. 2 days ago i found something interesting. Decompressed Tekken 5 models and FULLY decompressed Tekken 4 sounds (sounds of buttons + soundtrack). It is means that somebody had already extracted files. And i don't know how can i do the same. Everithing i need is character's animation sets and Tekken 4 audio and UI. Do you guys know how can i do this?
BTW sorry for my bad english it isn't my native language.

Here are some schenshots (xbdcemporess and Ravioli game tools, quickbms doesn't work. I need scripts...)
