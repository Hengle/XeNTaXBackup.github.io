I wrote simple command-line tool, so you can try it out yourself if you have the game . 

But I don't see anybody interested in modding the KAO games at this moment.

Hello everybody. 

The first post was updated with a link to the currently developed modding tool for Kao2 – "ZookieWizard".

This program supports all games from Kao the Kangaroo series that were developed on the "elephant" engine – that is all PC and console releases of "Kao the Kangaroo: Round 2", as well as "Kao: Mystery of the Volcano".
