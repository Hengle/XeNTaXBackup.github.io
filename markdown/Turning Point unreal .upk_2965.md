Hey.

I got the pc version of this UT3 engine run game and wish to extract the music. Does anyone have an extractor that can extract the .ogg files with their original filenames intact. It will help to id the tracks. With oggextract and audioripper, I just get offset details or numerical. 

The archive is S_Music.upk in the CookedPc\Packages\Sounds dir. 

Thanks

Unreal packages are a complicated format and changes between each game, best bet is to look at how the game reads out the unreal packages (I've done similar for Mass Effect).
