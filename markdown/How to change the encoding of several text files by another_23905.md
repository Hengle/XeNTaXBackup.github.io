- Post Title: How to change the encoding of several text files by another?

I have several text files with ANSI encoding, I want to change the encoding of all files to UTF-8 at just once.
How do I do that?

You could easily do it in any programming language.

Here are some examples:
[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/931 ... many-files](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9310571/how-to-change-encoding-in-many-files)
[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/355 ... iple-files](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35526466/notepad-convert-to-utf-8-multiple-files)
[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/168 ... on-windows](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1681568/change-files-encoding-recursively-on-windows)


You could also use tools like OmegaT to export your files with desired encoding.
But you have to create a project first,then import your files and then set export settings.
