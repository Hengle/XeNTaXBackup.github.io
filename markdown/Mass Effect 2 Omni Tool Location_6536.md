- Post Title: Mass Effect 2 Omni Tool Location

I hate to ask for help on something as simple as locating files but I've looked through the "cookedpc" folder for hours searching for the omni tool model and its eluding me, I've finally decided to stop and ask for directions. Can anyone shed some light on where it is located please? an actual filename would be very much appreciated. 
Thanks

The Omni-Tool is just a bunch of textures, can be found on almost every file, along with the mesh.
