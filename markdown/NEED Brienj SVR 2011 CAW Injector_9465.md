Not hard to find, I have the website, which links to Twitter and Facebook, but even if you had the program, it no longer works.  Wouldn't matter if you paid or not, it simply won't work.  I couldn't keep the servers up which allowed the program to work, because of morons that wanted to keep attacking them, so it was removed, and the program doesn't work now.  I am also finished doing modding and hacking publicly now.  Sorry.
