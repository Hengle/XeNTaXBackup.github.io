Hi Abkarino ! Sure, I'd help out. Could you send an example of such a PAK file?

Thanks for offering to be our man in Egypt! Welcome to the team!

Well, 1. my job is busy, 2. my family takes time, 3. coding on MexCom takes time, 4. a lot of request.  However, I looked at your file, and am still puzzled. Perhaps i can figure it out, but it's going to take time.
