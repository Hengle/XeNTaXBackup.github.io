- Post Title: BioShock 2: ConfigINI.ibf file editor?

Greetings.

Today's request is a special one. I'd like to do some PC BioShock 2 modding but alas! I am unable to do any relevant modifications to the all-knowing ini files. Most are hidden in a file called ConfigINI.ibf. Seems to be a coalesced of sorts. Hell if I know. All I know is that... surprise here! I need your help... so I would like to humbly ask for it.

Now the files get changed with each patch, so it's best if they are extracted from the latest one. The patch's cabinet, Media.cab can easily be opened via Total Commander and easily extracted, but the filenames are changed. Here's the filenames then:

Fid_85126B25_7CA5_70EF_163E_A95CFAE67667 with the size of 686508 bytes is ConfigINI.ibf for BioShock 2 MultiPlayer.
Fid_43BF466D_15C3_09F3_7E0B_FBDCE06D7014 with the size of 4113637 bytes is ConfigINI.ibf for BioShock 2 SinglePlayer.

[BioShock 2 1.5 Patch](http://www.fileplanet.com/209922/200000/fileinfo/BioShock-2---Patch-v1.5) can be downloaded here.

Now what I tried thus far:
- I found some post @ 2KGames' forums that contains extracted inis and instruction on how to use them, but that post is from 2010 -- it doesn't contain the latest INI files. As such, it is only of partial use for me. If you'd like to just extract the inis instead of making an editor per my request, I'd know how to make them work. But I still need the ini files extracted to do that :/
- I found an application called Simply BioShock (or was it BioShock 2?) Editor, but that one is for XBOX360 inis and refuses to open the PC ones. Needless to say, a similar application would be the optimal solution.

tl;dr version: I'd like either an extractor or an editor for ConfigINI.ibf to be able to mod BioShock 2 a bit. Thanks in advance!
