Persistent fellow. I'll hazard a guess that this game is... Infinite Crisis.

Have you considered, I don't know, lets say, provide valid, more concise information to your "urges", who knows, maybe some samples, etc etc.
And then sit back, and wait peacefully, because you never know who can actually help, you might be surprised by these amazing guys, just a friendly suggestion.
How about post FULL name of the game,
OS or device your  playing it on,
Samples, (as in actual data extracted/copied form the game) things like that.

Do NOT expect for someone to rush towards you and PM you, and willing fully help you, use some diplomacy, just saying, it never hurts to be considerate, we all have our lives after all.

EDIT: Oh, I just noticed, you already had created a request, this is just another one, oh well.

cheers
