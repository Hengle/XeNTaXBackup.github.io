- Post Title: [Zeebo] Action Hero 3D: Wild Dog (a3dres.res) file

Hello. I'm looking for a way to extract the files for this obscure game from this very obscure brazilian console called the Zeebo.
Action Hero 3D: Wild Dog is a game very similar to Viewtiful Joe.

All of it's graphics (the models, textures and sprites) are all stored inside a .res file.
I tried to open it using a sprites editor like TiledGGD (since I'm mostly interested in the sprites), but couldn't do anything.
I looked in the the file using a hex editor, and I have no idea what I'm looking at. (Though it seems to have .bmp images inside, which I think is what I'm looking for...)
I tried to use some file extractors that claimed could extract certain .res files, but it failed doing so with this specific file.
I even tried to use QuickBMS scripts and even tried to make my own... but I have no idea what I'm doing.

I really don't know what else to do, so I'm making a thread in this forum just to see if anyone can help me out with this... I'm all out of options.

Here's a link for the a3dres.res file, just in case anyone wants to look into it:

Thank you for your time.

Were you able to change the graphics or view the textures and 3D models?

I was very interested in modding Zeebo games and this game came to mind.
