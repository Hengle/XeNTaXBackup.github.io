- Post Title: Reader Rabbit Kart Racing .DCM and .DCT files?

the only ever 3d game in the entire series exclusively for iOS, I looked through the files and the models appear to be .DCM (I think anyways) and textures look to be .DCT, I can't find much about this file type other than .DCM is sometimes associated with DICOM but a viewer for this doesn't seem to open them, so I wondered if there was some other way maybe to do this?

I've uploaded the files for 1 character here

Try to use this script for the .DCM files, I don't know how to get the textures.
