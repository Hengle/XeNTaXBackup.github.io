This always happens when I run MEC:

It's not a problem as such, since the program continues to run OK after that, but the error dialog always pops up whenever I run it, after the "Checking online status" message is displayed in its console.

Yeah, I know, heard this from more people. It's a dummy html, basically to check wether the connection with the server is possible. It's not a script or anything.     The program just attempts to get the file, if it fails, it will assume the server cannot be reached and will stop running. I may know a thing or two about game archive encryption methods, but I'm no crack at server-based programming   , and just make silly routines like that up on the fly. "if it works it works"
