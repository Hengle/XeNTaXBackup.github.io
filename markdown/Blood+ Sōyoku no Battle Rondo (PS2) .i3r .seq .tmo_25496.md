- Post Title: Blood+: S≈çyoku no Battle Rondo (PS2) .i3r .seq .tmo

after some research I came across this post: [viewtopic.php?f=16&t=3490#p51129](https://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=3490#p51129) but not much into the .i3r from what i see, I believe that the .tmo has skeleton data, and i think .seq is textures, Any ideas?
