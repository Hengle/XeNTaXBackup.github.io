- Post Title: Oil rush models

Hey everyone,

I've been looking for a way to extract the models from Oil Rush (PC) and I couldn't even find them. I figured they must be packed and if they are then probably into a ung file. I looked around and found this tool: [http://aluigi.altervista.org/papers.htm#others-file](http://aluigi.altervista.org/papers.htm#others-file)
But it extracted 0 files for me. All textures are in a seperate folder, so I've already got those. I'd just need to find the models.

Thanks for any help in advance!

Seems I had the wrong code. Works now. Now I have a second problem though. The models are in .mesh format. And I tried using the SoaSE and Ogre converter, but that didn't work.

I attached two of the files. Would anyone have any suggestions for this?
