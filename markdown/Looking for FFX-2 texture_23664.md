- Post Title: Looking for FFX-2 texture

Hello!
Looking for help with finding a texture. I'd like to have Rikku's Black Mage outfit from FFX-2(final fantasy). I googled and I could only find it in low quality. I'd much rather have the HQ one! Does anyone have it? I have the HD version of the game on steam but I'm not sure how to extract it easily.
