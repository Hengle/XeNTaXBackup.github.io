When trying to extract the textures in Far Cry (PC) I get the error: Run-time Error '5': Invalid procedure call or arguement

  I can't extract any of the PAK files from Far Cry.

  Any ideas?

  Thanks.

  Thanks.

I can only imagine that the script for Far Cry does not work like it should on those files. The error you mention is odd though. 

Perhaps if you could also upload the log (CRTL+L) after restart (after the crash)? 

And could you also cut the archive with one of these cutters and then upload that file?
