- Post Title: The Walking Dead Collection TTARCH2 Files PS4

Does anyone have the ttarch2 files from the PS4 PKG Dump of The Walking Dead Collection? I'm trying to rip the models from them so that I can convert them to MMD (MikuMikuDance). I need the files from the Season 1 Remastered, 400 Days Remastered, Season 2 Remastered, Michonne Remastered, and A New Frontier Remastered from a PS4 PKG Dump. If anyone has these ttarch2 files, please DM me on Discord.
