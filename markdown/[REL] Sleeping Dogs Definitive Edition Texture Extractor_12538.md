- Post Title: [REL] Sleeping Dogs Definitive Edition Texture Extractor

After quite some time I finally was able to create an extractor for Sleeping Dogs DE .perm/.temp.bin files.

To use, unpack the .BIG files with [Ekey's DE unpacker](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?p=99472#p99472), copy the texture files into the same folder as the program, then run it and copy/paste in the name of the file.
Note: Texture files usually have a _TS extension.

[Executable](http://www.mediafire.com/download/69mli39agl8970a/SDDE_TexExtractor.jar)
[Source Code](http://www.mediafire.com/view/n4y9z0a3l7a8uz4/SleepingDogsTexExtractor.java)

Supported Dimensions:
1024x1024

Supported Compression:
DXT1, DXT5, ATI2N


This is essentially my very first program, so it's far from decent. It supports all compression but currently only one texture size.

Some texture files will still have to be extracted by hand no matter what. [I've explained the process here](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?p=100116#p100116).

Congratz, too, SergeantJoe!
There are not too many in this forum who "dare" the step from requesting to coding themselves.
Well done.
