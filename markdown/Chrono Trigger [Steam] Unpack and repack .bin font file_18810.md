- Post Title: Chrono Trigger [Steam] Unpack and repack .bin font file

Hello! I'm having troubles with the Steam version of Chrono Trigger (the most updated one, with the original graphics, better UI and all those changes Square Enix made to the mobile port).

I'm trying to replace the actual font of the game for the English, French, German, Italian, and Spanish translation of the game, and it seems to be packed inside a file called 'string_2.bin'. I've tried a lot of ways to decrypt and unpack the file (that it is supposed to have a .ttf font inside), without results.

Maybe someone here can help me with this, since I would like to unpack what it is inside, replace it, and then, repack it again.

The file in question is this:

Thanks in advance!

Bump, please!

Seriously, guys, I expected more help from Xentax, since this is the only site I know there is a lot of people related to romhacking and game research.
