- Post Title: Rip IRUNA Online MMORPG (Android) 3D Models

Hi XeNTaX! This is my first post on this forum.

I'd like to rip some 3D models from this Android game (IRUNA Online): [https://play.google.com/store/apps/deta ... a_en&hl=en](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.asobimo.iruna_en&hl=en)

So far, i've managed to get some game assets from password protected archives inside "Android/data" folder. They are BGM, Models, Animation, Texture, etc.

The model format used in this game is *.mbac, and the animation is *.mtra.
I've done googling those formats and found that they are Mascot Capsule's 3D Rendering Engine file format.

I've also managed to preview the model using Mascot Capsule's preview tool (PVMicro v5). Unfortunately, this tool doesn't let me to export the model.

And sadly, i was hoping that 3D Ripper DX would capable on capturing the previewed model. And of course it didn't work   

So the problem is, how do i get the model extracted and edit it inside 3D modeling apps?

Thank you very much community!
