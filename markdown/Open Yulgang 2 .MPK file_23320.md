These bin files looks custom, so probably there are no tools for them.

There's no way to edit it.？It's a file that must be modified for game localization. I can directly open the TDT file with Notepad, but there will be a lot of garbled code. One line of code will appear when I open bin. You can't run the game after editing directly. My guess is to convert TDT and thd files into bin files for modification, and then package bin files into TDT and thd files and put them into the game.

Yeah, there are no tools for this. You can always use hex editor if that is fine for you.

OK, thank you very much. Do you have a batch translation tool? I only need to translate Korean part. I have thousands of lua files to translate.
