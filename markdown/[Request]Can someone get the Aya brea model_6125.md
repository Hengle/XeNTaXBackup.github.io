- Post Title: [Request]Can someone get the Aya brea model?

Specifically from the 3rd birthday? I've done my look around on google but found nothing(I've also had two friends help but they found nothing), If it's not possible to get her model and textures from the 3rd birthday is it possible to get it from parasite eve 2? I'm a newb to this kind of thing. but I've messed around with animating and delved a bit into 3DS max and moreover blender.

I feel like I know you...

Well anyway, I think the 3rd Birthday uses a custom format similar to Crisis Core. So someone would have to take a look into the .pkg file.

I'm not sure on this, just going by what someone else said to me about it.

Hm? I'm a game developer and owner of the indie team NerfoDestiny if that means anything(Not like that really means much we haven't made an official game yet). Otherwise I've been on a few gaming forums.

Hm, Sadly I don't have a psp nor the games, so I have no way of checking, Nor do I have the knowledge on how to do so. 


Could someone take a look for me?

(Also, Thank you for the help! and sorry for such a late reply, I've been rather busy.)

files were compressed I think.. 

only alternative, is to hijack the models through memory of the PSP emu. and if that was also a failure, theres ways to dump geometry and and possibly textures. however would be a still frame capture of the current scene.

I'll have a crack at it on the weekend, but I'm out of the loop with all the PSP stuff.. I might not be able to do all of what I just said

Most data is not compressed. Extract the pkg with Noesis 2.85 and it will sort the files into folders for you. Look at arcs/*.pack files and you'll see many files (file0329.pack, 30, 31, etc) have model data right there plain as day. MDL headers with visible surface/material strings and tons of plainly visible vertex data. Should be pretty easy to make a model importer for the format.

So does that mean we can view the model with noesis and export it as another filetype ?

It will probably be supported in the next Noesis, assuming I don't hit any snags. I've been meaning to look at the data more in-depth for days, but playing Vindictus, Bulletstorm, and now MVC3 keeps getting in the way.

There's that. Still working on skeletal models, cause the bone list is weird. Most of it is pretty similar to the FF7CC format, though.

Edit: Oops, I was just getting tripped up by padding.

That'll be in Noesis 2.9, then. Whenever I get that out. Still in the middle of numerous other formats.

My attempted-english-to-english translator cannot discern exactly what you're attempting to convey here. But all of the T3B models work fine in Noesis for me. There are only a few (mostly at the start and end of the main archive) .pack files that don't contain model or texture data and so will not load in Noesis.

Cutscenes are pre-rendered, so no wedding dress.

Files 0653-0663 in the Japanese version. Don't know if it's the same for other regions. Plus there was the screenshot of the bunny costume one on the main Noesis page. And me just saying up there that all of the actual models load fine in Noesis.

I give up.

Extract 3rd.fsd and 3rd.pkg in the same folder. Use Noesis to export 3rd.pkg and you will have .pack file in 3rd_files\arcs\
Preview .pack with noesis, Aya model from File0653.pack to File0663.pack

Hi Trishty,

The "procedure" will be decompress all models of the game and thats include the Aya model

Note: Most of the models are only "lowpoly" version, you can blame for that to square-enix LOL
