By scanning these ive managed to rip out TIM2 Images.
(which is a PlayStation 2 format), i dont know yet if these are valid
files, i have to get a TIM2 reader first :X

*ill get back to this*

Edit: Confirmed, it is TIM2 Images baked into these small archive files.

to scan the files and rip out TIM2 images. (be sure to set TIM2 selected
on option screen and save).

And after that, Download XnView to view them

Just to mention. there arent really any interesting images in those archive
files. most of them (99%) is just text and instructions.
no REAL images =o , so dont waste your time going thru all of them :X

or maybe you are translating the game?, that would turn it all around.

Yep something like that. BTW, I have a feeling that the ripper is missing some files...

I have no idea if its missing files yet =( , basically because the TIM2
ripper is very untested. but i will look into the code of it and see 
if it has any potential flaws. if there are, they will be corrected. =)
