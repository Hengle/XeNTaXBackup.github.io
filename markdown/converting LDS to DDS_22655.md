- Post Title: converting LDS to DDS

Hi faithful members,

I have a game "captain tsubasa rise of new champions" i want to extract LDS texture file to dds. I know from hex editor the header contains dds, but how to convert it to dds.
i know there is a tool but cant find it. Moreover, I got one but cant use it due licensing issue. 

by the way if I have a file format in the game which is unknown and i know for sure quickbms and noesis cant read it. how can i analyze it and read it or at least some one guide me what should i read and how to write scripts for converting or reading. 

Thanks in advance.
