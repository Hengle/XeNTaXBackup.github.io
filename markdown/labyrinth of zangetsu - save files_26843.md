- Post Title: labyrinth of zangetsu - save files

hello i am trying to work out the compression of labyrinth of zangetsu save files. i have a ps4 save that as the save files combined into 1 file. it seems to be encoded into base64 then it is compressed. the base64 only applies to ps4 save and on switch or pc the saves are individual files. I have included the ps4 save and 2 pc saves. i hope someone can guide me in the right direction.
