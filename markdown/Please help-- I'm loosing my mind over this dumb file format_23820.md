Hey all! I'm just going to try to keep this short and sweet. There's a rhythm/dancing game that I love called Dance Central 3. What I want to do is export the motion data of the routines in the game so I can use the motion data in other programs (I'm trying to convert it to .vmd) My problem is the files are .milo_xbox (this is an Xbox 360 game) and I literally cannot find ANYTHING on how to even open this file let alone convert it. I've downloaded many different programs that didn't work, and I literally looked everywhere for some help and I couldn't find any information. If anyone can help I would greatly appreciate it!
