Has anyone had any luck ripping or finding info if anyone else has ripped models yet? I saw that its still .map files like the xbox version but uses unreal possibly. Of course the umodel viewer doesn't work[yet maybe]

Edit - Nevermind had a lightbulb and went to 405th, they had a way to but the files mostly only contain spartan gear/elites. Not sure where the rest is other than the map files but with adjutant not working with em not sure.
