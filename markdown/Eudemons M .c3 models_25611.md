It uses the Conquer Online .c3 format.

You can open it using the 3D Object Converter or i3DConverter apps.

Durik! one last thing, I have been checking like 80% of the files, and got error in some of them, could you give a quick look to them please? and could you explain a bit how to get the uv data from this model? 000a3147.c3, I where able to get the model with your guidance but wasn't able to get the correct uv values yet. Thanks!

how to get the uv data from this model? 000a3147.c3
what exactly is not clear? look inside the plugin:
stride 40:

```
uvs - 8 (+4)
boneID, boneID - 4, 4
weight, weight - 4, 4

```
