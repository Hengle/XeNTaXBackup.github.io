- Post Title: [Request] Super Heroine Chronicle

Hi,about Super Heroine Chronicle,I have extracted this.

The game contain *.cpk file, it's can't use cpk.bms to extract,but using Noesis can extract.

Images file is *.phyre file, so i don't know convert to *.dds.

Now i just use TextureFinder to see image.


This file header.


So i want to know how to batch convert to *.dds or others.

Thanks!

I have try to it but it didn't work with "003se01_03.dds.phyre"

Can you work 'exhappyend' with "003se01_03.dds.phyre"

Otherwise,it is my using step wrong.

error message
">exhappyend.exe 003se01_03.dds.phyre
Could not open  (No such file or directory)"

exhappyend only support 'ARGB8888' or 'RGBA8888' *.dds.phyre,not support DXT
so it can't work Super Heroine Chronicle.
