- Post Title: 32-bit buffer? Strange TIM2 files in a ps2 game.

So um, I've got some texture files from a PS2 game called "Parappa The Rapper 2" and I've already talked about these, but recently they've been solved. These are swizzled and buffered TIM2 textures named .tm0. However, the person who has solved them, won't give the tool in exact, but one of his friends gave us how it works. "Textures are 4-bit swizzled into a 32-bit buffer. The CLUTs of various formats are combined with the 4-bit textures.", so we've solved them, however, since I'm kind of a dumbo, I have no idea what a 32-bit buffer is. Could someone perhaps give me help on what this means, and it'd really help if you gave me an encoder and decoder because we really like modding textures!
