- Post Title: (SOLVED) [PSX] Wu-Tang - Shaolin Style : Images Extractions / Insertions (DTA Files)

Hello everyone,

I have a question for you:

Do you know why jPSXdec dont open some DTA files like the others ?

I have manage to extract most of every graphic of the game, but not the loading screen...

I see i have 3 files in that format (DTA) wich the program see nothing. I think what i need is inside...

Here is the 3 files if someone can help me : [https://mega.nz/file/bshgRBDC#C3RQD386j ... kEwTc6DGp4](https://mega.nz/file/bshgRBDC#C3RQD386jwzBKGvbJMEUAVCWnw4yPZnuLkEwTc6DGp4)

I need to extract, edit and reinsert back after in the file... (It's for a translation)

I have joined an RTT file too, just in case, but i dont really know what is it and if it's usefull.

Thank!

the files you´ve attached do not contain images.

Loading image is a simple .tga

Inside the folder FRONT/STILLS

loading.tga
you can open in adobe photoshop or any tga viewer.

With that image the game gonna be 100% translated.

Edit: If by chance you are able to help me about DAT & DTA files, in my 2 thread, let me know!

Anyway thank you very much!
