I am trying to rip the music from the PC game LEGOLAND, but it appears to be in non-standard formats (.bnd, .sgt, .sty). If anyone could please show me how to convert these files to a standard format (e.g. .wav, .mp3, .mid, .mod) I would greatly appreciate it.

The Files are simply too small to be even mod tracker audio as no pcm samples either, presumably something like midish with notes and what not information and having checked youtube feed of the game the music indeed is quite basic to fit this aspect. If thats all there is, then game is likely just using those as control files to "generate" the music and its not normal mid format either. Maybe somebody knows but this is ooold times.

The .bnd file appears to have something to do with the instruments. (Possibly the .bnd file stores the instruments, and the .sgt and .sty contain the actual sequence?)
