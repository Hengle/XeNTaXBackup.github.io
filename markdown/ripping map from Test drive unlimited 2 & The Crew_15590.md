hello,

ive heard that the maps in both games TDU2 & The Crew are meshes. Anyone tried to export & rip them already? im interest to try it out myself and port them to gta san andreas but i would like to know if someone already tried or are the available tools to rip stuff only for cars?

TDU is possible, but i think it might be a bit too much data for GTA 5 to handle. it is basically the same as the Lidar data available from the USGS website. Also it is only the terrain, not all the buildings and street lights and stuff..

It is Also GB of data.. Just one single tile of TDU data is about 750,000 polygons

thanks for your answer. The Crew is not possible? Seems like the models have to be cut into smaller parts then.
Also, i dont want mod gta 5 for now, i wanted to put the map into gta san andreas because the limits there are hacked.
