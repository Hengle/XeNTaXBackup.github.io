- Post Title: MicroVolts .NIF Archives

Hello! I am looking on how to get the .nif files from MicroVolts game, I want the models to do animations, renders and outfits to showcase to the game devs, I looked a lot but the closest thing I saw was this forum post: 

[viewtopic.php?t=26030](https://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?t=26030)

Which I already tried with the QuickBMS but, I need the exact script from the one in the list to make it, I've been looking for hours and I am really really looking for it, someone can help me please?
