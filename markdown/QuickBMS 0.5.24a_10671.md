- Post Title: QuickBMS 0.5.24a

Currently there are some problems in a new optimization I added in the latest version of the tool, for example it doesn't work correctly with the cpk.bms script and the CPK files ("TOC signature not found").
I'm trying to find the error.

If you need to use the older version of the tool, 0.5.24 (which works correctly), you can get it from here:
[http://aluigi.org/papers/quickbms_0.5.24.zip](http://aluigi.org/papers/quickbms_0.5.24.zip)

I will let you know when the fixed version is ready.
