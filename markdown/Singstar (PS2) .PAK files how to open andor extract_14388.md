- Post Title: Singstar (PS2) .PAK files how to open and/or extract

Hello I am trying to open a bunch of PAK files from the PS2 game Singstar Rocks and I am having trouble. I've tried all of my game ripping tools and none of them can open these files. I saw a couple of extractors online but one was infested with malware and the other was in pieces and not possible to use. one of my tools was able to partially extract audio but only a few pieces and nothing useable. Please help.
