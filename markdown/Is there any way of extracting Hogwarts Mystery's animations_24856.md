- Post Title: Is there any way of extracting Hogwarts Mystery's animations?

Hey! So... I'm kinda noob with this but is it possible to extract the animations from Hogwarts Mystery? I've had countless unsuccessful attempts with Ninja Ripper and different versions of Nox. I just wanted to know if I'm not trying in vain. That's for study purposes only. Thanks in advance
