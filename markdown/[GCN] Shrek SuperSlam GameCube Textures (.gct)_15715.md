- Post Title: [GCN] Shrek SuperSlam GameCube Textures (.gct)

Hi all,

Myself and a few others have been trying to extract the files from the Gamecube version of Shrek SuperSlam. We have managed to decompress the files, but still need to make sense of the resulting files. Part of this is the textures, which use an unknown format. None of us are particularly experienced with the Gamecube, but we are struggling to find any matches to this format by searching. Searching for popular Gamecube textures within the file has also given nothing useful. Is the following familiar to anyone?

File Extension: .gct
Signature: GCNT (47 43 4e 54)

I am unsure if I can share the file directly here, if not then I am happy to share the code and instructions on extracting the files to the point where this can be recreated. We have also extracted the PC version's files, which come out as regular .dds files, so we know what most of these textures should look like.

Thanks!
