Dunno. Haven't seen the game yet. Perhaps I'll find a demo.

I started looking into this to try and get the Sound Effects from the game.
Not the music.

I found a tool (Enter The Matrix Sound Manager v1.01) that converts .WAD to .WAV as a single file.
But inside the .WAV file contains oodles of sfx files.

However, I'm wondering if there's anyway to split the .WAV files into multiple files to make individual SFX files as apposed to the clustered single .WAV file.

I've googled for more information but haven't found any luck.
I would go through the .WAV file with an audio editor and save each section as a new .WAV file, but that would be extremely tedious. And possibly lose track and end up with the same file several times.

Does anyone know a simpler way of extracting the SFX?

Any information would be greatly appreciated!
I also searched this forum and found this was the only thread talking about ETM.WAD files.
