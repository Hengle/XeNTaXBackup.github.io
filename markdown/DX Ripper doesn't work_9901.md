- Post Title: DX Ripper doesn't work?

So I think I'm using the wrong  dxripper but none of them work. I could see why for sleeping dogs and sr3 cuz its beyond directx 9, if that is so. I mainly want to rip models and animate movies.

Can somebody give me a list of games that work? Or correct my list?

I want to extract from:

Max Payne 3
Darkness 2
Sleeping Dogs
Fable The Lost Chapters
Deus Ex: Human Revolution

And the threads on this forum for them are all pretty much inactive, dead, or don't exist other than maybe Sleeping Dogs which seems to have been progressing.

Well iam using the last version that was 1.1.0 and works fine, i dont know abouth the first 4 games you mentioned
but it works fine on Deus Ex human Revolution (And also worksd on the missing link) just use DX9 instead of DX11
other wise you will get pink textures and bad ripped models, if you wish i can upload my version so you can test.

DX Ripper is the older version that works only with DDraw, DX8 and DX9. The latest one is renamed to Ninja Ripper - [http://cgig.ru/ninjaripper/](http://cgig.ru/ninjaripper/).

Have fun.
