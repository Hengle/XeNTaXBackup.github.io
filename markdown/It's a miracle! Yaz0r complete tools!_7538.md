HOLY COW! Look what I found! And to be nice, I'm going to share the love with you all!

Introducing from lost in the past...

Yaz0r's tools!

Includes:
ffx2obj Msvc
ffx2obj Static
ffx2obj
ffxdumper
FFXView
And all the required dlls!

But wait, there's more!

FFXView
and it's dlls!

We are far from finished!

KHview.exe!


ModelViewerWXD3D9
And
ModelViewerWXD3D9

We still got even more!

ffxdumper.exe... old version!

And...

FFXIIDumper.exe, with a text file!

Hold it! We're not finished yet!

KH2Dump.bat
KH2Dump.exe

Did I say we are still not finished?

khdump-0.2-alpha1!

Wait a sec... is that...?

mcbears viewer!

Ready for use with all of it's files!

Is that...

ModelViewerWXD3D9_0.3_new!!!

Wait... what's this?!

toolextract for FFX!!!


What if I edit the file by accident?

We got the tools all in rars and zips! Ready for reuse!

And to wrap it all up...

A back up rar of all of the rars!

You can't beat this sweet deal!

And best of all... it's all free! Way to go me! (I'm a poet and I didn't know it...)

It's on a Mediashare host that gets views every week by me, so it will never expire!

 I have other tools to share (You'll have to wait till this weekend)! I am officially starting an archive of tools of the past!

So, if this file ever expires for downloading, ring this service bell (post on the forum) to notify me and I'll be on my way asap! >>> [viewtopic.php?f=28&t=7537](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=28&t=7537)

And now... back from the past... here is the tool you've all been waiting for...

YAZ0R's TOOLS!

Edit: Yaz0r... I hope this is okay with you...

What's the story behind this? Did all these tools disappear or something? If so, where did you find copies?

Mr.Mouse, Craptain, perhaps you guys could host a copy of these tools so they don't disappear in the future?

Well, Yaz0r uploaded on his site a bunch of tools. Some time ago in 2007 or something, his site went down, and then he removed it... or someone did. His tools were still around, uploaded by others. Unfortionately, nearly every download either expired and/or was removed by the host or the website. I so happened to come across the files at this link here using custom google searches (source): [http://rghost.net/8713891](http://rghost.net/8713891)

No, can't think of any at the point except the QL2viewer (the correct one) for Khview... doesn't seem to register correctly.

The next time I'm on my computer (Tommorrow), I'll post the dumper.

Sorry, I didn't know there was a source code. I'll see if I can find one.

Major necropost, but rather than creating a new thread... it seems stupid since this one is relevant.

Does someone know of a way to actually use the animations found with the tools, either via Noesis or other tools?
