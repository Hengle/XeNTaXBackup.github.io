- Post Title: PS3 Counter-Strike Global Offensive ".ps3.zip" format

I assume such a script or extract exists already considering how long this game has been out, but searches have run up dry for me. If anyone can point me into the right direction that'd be swell.

In the chances such a extractor does NOT exist. I have attempted to use QuickBMS with the zip script. It gets to 10% and fails.



There's another ".ps3.zip" file to what I assume is an update to the game, however that gets to 99% of the file.

Did it extract anything?
I think the Xbox 360 versions of Source games had regular .zip files in big endian format - maybe it's something similar with the PlayStation 3 version? [https://github.com/CRACKbomber/Source360](https://github.com/CRACKbomber/Source360) opens Xbox 360 .zip files I think.

It extracted some data, but running the same QuickBMS script on the 360 CSGO files ended up extracting the whole thing instead of 8 files.
