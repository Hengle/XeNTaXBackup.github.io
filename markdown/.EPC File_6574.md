- Post Title: .EPC File

Hello im new to the forum  
ive been looking through the quickbms tutorials by chrrox, but im having difficulty working out how to extract files from this .epc file format
from viewing the file in hex editor i know there are .mb files (maya format). ive provided a link to a .epc file if anyone want to take a glance at it [http://www.megaupload.com/?d=NBMXY24B](http://www.megaupload.com/?d=NBMXY24B)
also here is a screen grab of the hex view of the file
