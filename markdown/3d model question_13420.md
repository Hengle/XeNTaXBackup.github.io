that's not correct: Noesis for example can import Playstation All Stars *.cskn models iirc.

The problem is that it's harder to create tools for console games than for pc games.
You can't simply run your own exe file on consoles.

For them you're often forced to use workarounds for analysing like emulators
or analysing eeMemory.bin from a pcsx2 save state for example.

Just google and read.

Also. There's no news on porting Marvel Ultimate Alliance 360 Gold Edition only IGB models (from actors, models, ui folders) & converting its sound files

Would you mind sharing how to port these IGB files? I want to get some models off of the cat in the hat game over to 3ds max or maya.
