Hey all,

I recently extracted the sound directories out of these Sega Vintage Collection games on XBLA but can't seem to figure out what format they're in. File extension is PSB and I noticed "sound_archive.x360" in the header. I'm guessing XMA but I can't tell for sure, been a while since I did this sort of thing.

I uploaded one of the files here:

Any ideas? Some of this music is really good.

Also would like some help with those files, not quite sure how to go about getting it to convert to a wav.
