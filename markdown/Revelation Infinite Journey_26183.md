Alternative titles: Revelation Mobile ([site](https://revelation.vnggames.com))

Here is modified AssetStudio (as a side effect from different research), which is more or less compatible with the game, except for animations ([link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SCmhdzWn2vxblKqPqVOq-Eykx8wxULSd/view?usp=sharing), updated). Also you need to split pg containers into separate asset bundles first - it can be done with attached script or any similar one with the same functionality.

What's implemented: zstd support for compressed blocks, quick fix for textures and some meshes (not sure if correct).

It is recommended to use AssetStudio with the console version, because there are too many animation errors that require manual clicking.

@iceS: You can suppress errors in gui version via "debug" menu -> "show error message".
