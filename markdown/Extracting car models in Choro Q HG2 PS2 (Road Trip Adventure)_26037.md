Hello, I am new in this kind of stuff and first time doing this because I really want to do this,

I manage to get the texture but the only thing I need to know is how can I view and get the model, I am trying to understand on using hex2obj and hex searching for vertices and faces, and I'm not sure if there's another way to view them but If you know how, I'll be glad to know

Hello, well, it's using VIF tags (surprise). 01800C68 for example here. I made a similar approach for Konami EPR .dat files with 6 downloads in 9 months.

People don't seem to like the MakeObj/H2O approach so it's not worth the effort for me.

(If you've basic coding skills I could tell you more.)

Have you finished it? I am waiting for your reply and if you have already finished it please share your work. I would love to see it. I am waiting for your reply. I am glad I found your post, I was looking for the [https://thewordpoint.com/languages/danish-translation](https://thewordpoint.com/languages/danish-translation) website online because my cousin brother wants to translate something into the Danish language and he told me to search for a site online where he can find Danish translation service.
