- Post Title: unable to open a .BIG file

I just purchased lord of the rings: the battle for middle earth.

I was over the moon when i saw that the game could be modded  (Being an EA game with .BIG files) but MultieX is unable to open these files    is there an update for MultieX i can get so it will be able to open these files or is there another way?

I have the latest MultiX v4.0.1

Thanks for your time

I tried it to. I think the files are similar to C&C Generals .big files since it's the same engine. If I had Gerals on my computer, I would check this, but I'm to lazy to install it.

(If someone needs a bfme .big, just ask and I'll send you data.big (only 250kb))

OK, here it is...  

(btw. move this to game requests)

Edit:
Seems as if there are some problems with uploading the file. So just get it from my webserver: [http://www.dfyx.de/temp/Data.big](http://www.dfyx.de/temp/Data.big)

Okay, I have seen the problem. The ID-tag in the file is different. 

But, you can already open these with MultiEx Commander. 

1. Get MultiEx Commander v4.01
2. Choose update from web from within the Commander. 

You will now also be able to open Need For Speed : Underground 2 .VIV files. Just use this format to open the BFME files. To do this, first type *.* as filename, and then you can just select the *.BIG file. 

 

I will implement it in a web update as a BFME *.BIG file and also include it in the next release. 

Cheers!
