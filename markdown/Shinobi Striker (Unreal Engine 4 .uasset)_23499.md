- Post Title: Shinobi Striker (Unreal Engine 4 .uasset)

First of all I'm a complete noob here and if one doesn't want to explain things to me it would still help if you could point me to a tutorial maybe? I would be willing to learn it myself.

So, I'm trying to access assets from the game "Shinobi Striker". I'm using Unmodel for this, but the tool crashes when trying to extract/export static meshes. Is there a way to export the 3D Models in a usable format somehow?
