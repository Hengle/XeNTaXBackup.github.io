Information for those searching for it.

bfstm, FSTM header:
Single audio files convertable using Foobar with the VGMStream plugin and simular tools.

bfsar, FSAR header:
Audio archive that is extractable using BFSAR_Split, Retsuko Sound Tool and simular tools.
Extracted files do not have useful names, i.e. 0000 or 0x3b0fc0-0x3b2f58.
The FWAR files in it can then be converted using Foobar/VGMStream.

bfgrp, FGRP header:
Same as bfsar

Audio converted to ogg is in my archive, I cannot post it here due to site policy, if you google my username then you should find it.

Hey there. I've been working on Dread too for the Sounds Resource. I got about all the info you did.
Now I'm just looking for a more efficient way to get the correct filenames and such. In the system/snd folder there are .bapd files which contain strings for .wav filenames in their hex codes. Not sure if that's useful information but it could be a step towards streamlining the names? It sounds like a whole new program or bms script would have to be made to match them up automatically tho.
