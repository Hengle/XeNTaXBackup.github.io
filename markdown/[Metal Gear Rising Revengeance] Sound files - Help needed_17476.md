- Post Title: [Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance] Sound files - Help needed

Greetings. Not sure if it's a correct forum section to post this in...

I'm trying to find certain sound files within the MGR:R game archives, but without any luck so far. A stream.cpk file contains only 278 sound files (which alone is weird enough), and those I need aren't among them. A data002.cpk archive contains a debug header file called "Wwise_IDs.h" which points out the sounds I need along with their filenames(?), but I can't figure out where to look for them. Could anyone assist me with this? I'd very much appreciate that.

The files I need are mentioned in this header as follows:

```
static const AkUniqueID BGM_BOOST_MAX = 216311030U;
static const AkUniqueID CORE_SE_SYS_CHIP_GET = 713438971U;
static const AkUniqueID CORE_SE_SYS_RADIO_CALL_ON = 984175164U;
static const AkUniqueID CORE_SE_SYS_RADIO_EXIT = 2780774324U;

```


Would be even better to be able to locate all UI-related sounds.
