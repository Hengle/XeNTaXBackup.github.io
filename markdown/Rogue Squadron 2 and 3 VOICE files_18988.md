- Post Title: Rogue Squadron 2 and 3 VOICE files

Hi xentax!

Im looking to extract the Rogue squadron 2 and 3 voice files. I know the audio has been extracted but it's a different format (.vdy).


Per forum etiquette i cannot post the files directly. If you feel obliged please respond here and i'll send the link via pm.

Hope you can help me!
