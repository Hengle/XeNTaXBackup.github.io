- Post Title: Need help with .dat files

Hello!

Can anyone help me open/unpack .dat files?
I've tried several bms scripts, but they all give an error.
The files are game resources and must contain the game script. This is an otomate visual novel for Nintendo Switch.[https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/ ... drive_link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/11UJV1Up1GszgjhOxHSSAWRjEeO8H31sQ?usp=drive_link)

Thanks!
