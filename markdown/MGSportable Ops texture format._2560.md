- Post Title: MGS:portable Ops texture format.

Recently got this game..
and well tbh ive ripped bits apart here and then (combination of STUNS and a few other tthings including Jaeder)

I can extract some kind of image fromt he file though im unsure what it is..
jsut seems to be a buncha green matrix looking numbers..(yes il show an example sometime too).

Anywhere here able to help out?
I know THERE ARE images in here but they just seem to be encrypted maybe or even Swizzled (if thats the word for what some Xbox games use).

IL attach the 2 files from the "title" folder and within there i also have 3 files which i decompressed using STUNS..(from the title.prx file)
[title.rar](https://xentaxbackup.github.io/file/1111_title.rar)
