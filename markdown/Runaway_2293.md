I worked on that game quite some time ago; without finishing however. In any case, I have attached the current state of my work tools, maybe somebody can start from there.

There are three distinct programs in the archive (for 000, M?? and S?? files, respectively). Each can be called by

```
program.exe file.dat /wav
```

where "/wav" is an optional parameter that causes the applications to try and extract the files as wave data, in case you suspect audio in the archives.

As far as I can recall, I managed to extract some music samples from the game archives before I stopped working on them. I am not sure in which state the applications are, so they might eventually work a bit, fail completely or do anything and nothing ...


Good luck,

Deniz

Do not say that too hastily. I really do not remember if anything of this works at all. 

In any case, the user is confronted with a bunch of generically named .wav or .dat files after extraction. They will have to find out the files' purposes by themselves ...
