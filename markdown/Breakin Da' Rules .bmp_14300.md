- Post Title: Breakin Da' Rules *.bmp

Hey all, upon extracting the .gcp archives, I've run into these invalid BMP files that I was wondering if someone could take look at. I'm positive there is an encryption key (Hence the keylist.txt file?) and may be needed to decrypt them. Could anyone help me? Thanks, and sorry if this was a topic already posted!
