- Post Title: CR RING2 - 7 Days of Curse - Extracting Assets

Hello.
Game Name: CR RING2 - 7 Days of Curse
I want to decrypt and extract a game archive file of an android mobile game, I have successfully extracted the audio file out of the video and audio files stored in that archive file, but I can't do it with difficulty only with the video file.
-------
The tool used to extract the audio files is called Extarct Data. This tool has a simple decryption function, but it is unable to detect video files due to insufficient file types in the file search function within the archive file.
It is possible by decrypting and extracting the game archive file or by modifying the "extract data" tool.
-------
If anyone can help me, I would appreciate it if you could send me a message.
Thank you in advance.
