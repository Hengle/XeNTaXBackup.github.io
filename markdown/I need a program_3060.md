- Post Title: I need a program

Hey, I was wondering if there's a program that will let me extract .669 audio files from any file...as you may know I have a topic about some .ips and .ipu files in the compressed files and methods subforum. Well after some more researching I believe that the audio in those movie files is encoded in .669 format, so Iwas wondering if there's something that will let me extract it? I'll probably find more in the next days to come so anything else helpful would be appreciated, but right now what I need is a program that can extract .669 audio files...I don't care if it's a GUI or a Command Line, I can handle both.

Edit:
OK, they may not be .669 files, forget that.
However the video layer could be MJPEG, I installed a codec for it but I can't play anything...
