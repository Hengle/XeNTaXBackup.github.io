- Post Title: [Req] Sleeping Dogs Wei Shen Model Extraction

So I wanted to make a video using Wei Shen and animating him n stuff, but first of all I need to be able to extract him from the game.  If anyone can do so, please leave below on how to.

I saw this thread:
[viewtopic.php?f=10&t=9481&start=30](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=9481&start=30)

But seeing how it's almost a month dead, I was wondering if anyone knows how to extract models, well. I really only need Wei Shen's model. I don't care what he's wearing, as long as it's wei shen.

Please reply asap
