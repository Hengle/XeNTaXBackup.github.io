- Post Title: [PS2] Need help with Ratchet Deadlocked

Hi, Ari3s, I'm new kinda new here and fairly new to the whole PS2 modding scene. So, I'm not exactly sure how to decompress my copy of Ratchet Deadlocked (NTSC version) so I can get all the files I need/want from it. I tried using Game Extractor but no luck. Not sure if Deadlocked isn't supported, or I'm just too stupid, or what. Can someone help me out here?
