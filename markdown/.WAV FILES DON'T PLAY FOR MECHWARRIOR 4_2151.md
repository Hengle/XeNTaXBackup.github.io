- Post Title: .WAV FILES DON'T PLAY FOR MECHWARRIOR 4

what i have noticed from opening the .wav files in notepad is that all the files that do play have this line of code in front

RIFFR4  WAVEfmt 2     DÂ¬  Â£V      Ã´      Ã¿    Ã€ @ Ã°   ÃŒ0Ã¿Ë†Ã¿fact

and al the files that don't play don't.  any clue?

The ones that don't play are missing a header, which is what that line of code is. Try opening a file that does play and one that doesn't side by side in a hex editor, and copy the line that you posted from the file that does play and paste it at the beginning of the file that doesn't, then save and try to listen to it again.

That won't work, because the headers are file specific. Like I said in a previous post about MW4 files, check those files that have {handle} in their names, those might be the correct headers for .wav files with the same name, but not with {handle} in their name. !!!

the handles have different info in them.  they're very short codes

startup1_bet.wav{handle}
 f    

startup2_bet.wav{handle}
 h    

so it doesn't seem like those will work.

is there any way to recreate the missing header for those files that won't play?  somehow the game plays them.

It seems to me that the non-playable files may be compressed WAVE files.

Every packed .wav (from the example) start like this

> Â¥$1bD,  Â®Â±RÃ„L: d   @  DX!

The same header...

actually, how can they be compressed when they're about the same size as the working ones?

What point in compressing if they remain larger than the working ones?

It seems to be encrypted. If you look at the first 4 bytes (skipping the first byte), they're 'RIFF' if you reverse the bits and "play" with them a little. At least I don't think it's a coincidence.

@TsunamiZ:
Can you upload the game's exe somewhere?

Edit: The values are rotated (some left, some right) and sometimes the first or last bit of the previous value is appended to the current value. The encoded bytes seem to be grouped in blocks of 8 bytes + 1 byte at the beginning of each block.

Good news, the files seem to be LZW-compressed. I already located the decompression code in the exe, it's just a matter of time now

And here it is 

Download from [http://gamefileformats.the-underdogs.in ... -mw4-1.zip](http://gamefileformats.the-underdogs.info/files/delzw-mw4-1.zip)

Give the name of the compressed file (i.e. the ones that don't play) and as second parameter the name of the new file.

The source code is included, in case Mr.Mouse wants to add support to Mex.

Actually, John_doe, Rahly wrote a plugin manager that enables anyone to create a plugin for MexCom, with Non-activeX dll's. MexCom has two types of plugins. ActiveX (PGN) and those that work via Rahly's Plugin Manager (RPM).  

Theoretically, instead of writing a command line tool,you could also write a plugin for MexCom by compiling a DLL.   You'd only have to get a skeleton dll with standard functions from Rahly (or peek in those that are already provided by MexCom) and fill in the blanks. It couldn't possibly be a lot more work.

You need to use it from the command line.

Well, I can always try to get hold of some source code for you, if you're interested. I'll ask Rahly.

ok i figured how to work it now by typing a line such as this

C:\22\delzw.exe C:\22\commoffline_bet.wav C:\22\yes.wav

but is there anyway you can create a gui for this?  such as:

source:_____ [browse button]
output:_____ [browse button]
[convert button]

there are A LOT [hundreds] of files I need to convert and this would save A LOT of time typing in each line of code.  please?

Hmm... sounds like you might want to use a batch file for that... Unfortunately, I don't know any tutorials for them, and I don't know about writing them to make one for you.

Open a new text file and rename it to run.bat. 

Then edit it so it contains this line:

```
delzw.exe %%F %%F.dec
)

```


This will scan the current directory for all files and attempt to decompress them to <filename>.dec

Make sure delzw.exe is in the same dir as the batch file. 

So go to the dos console and run the batch file simply by typing 'run.bat'.
