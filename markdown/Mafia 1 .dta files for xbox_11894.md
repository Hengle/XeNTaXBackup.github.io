- Post Title: Mafia 1 .dta files for xbox

not sure if i should post here or game archive? anyways i was hoping to see if anyone knew how to get the .dta files from this game open so i could poke around the models, maybe use the pc enhanced models instead?

its from the original xbox so i hope thats fine?

thanks!
