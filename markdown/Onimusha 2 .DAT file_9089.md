I found some tools to extract some of the dat files, too bad its only extract BGM.DAT and Voice_E.DAT

Here's the tools



Maybe you guys in xentax can make new unpacker based on these tools so it can unpack more DAT file???

I'm still hope that someone can extract  onimusha 2 models,at leas unpacking DAT file.I'll be patient for that...but if its impossible i hope someone able to try explaining "Sorry this game is hard encrypted because ..blablabla" or "Nope,Its impossible because blablabla.." so everything is clear,and i give up

its possible to convert those files.
I am not very interested in most ps2 games as they are normally fairly low quality.
this is not really an archive file its just a model resource.
you can see floats clearly in the format and most likely it uses auto generated triangle strips for the faces.

Thanks for your explanation chrrox. So it is a relatively easy to extract the model then? maybe add it to noesis? i know most ps2 games has low poly model and outdated compare to high poly next gen console model, but last release ps2 game has a better detail model rather than previous. What about onimusha dawn of dreams?? it has better detail than onimusha 2 model. Maybe if you interested analyze it, i can provide you some sample..i just want ohatsu model thats all    thanks!
