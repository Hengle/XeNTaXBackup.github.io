- Post Title: Need help decrypting (and maybe ripping) the .bin model files in Rage Fighters (Mobile MMORPG)

Hi everyone reading this post, recently i wanted to extract the models from a mobile game i used to play called "Rage Fighters". But upon opening the .obb archive file, i realized that the content files has been encrypted with some kind of encrypting technique, with 1 file called "kartPkgAssets.dat" contained the path and a hex string for "something" for each files in the archive. Because i don't know much about encrypt/decrypt things, i'm here to ask you guys if you know what type of encryption it is, and how to decrypt it. I included a sample file for a mesh file in the archive (the file and the hex string) below so you guys can figure out what it is. And finally, thank you in advance!
