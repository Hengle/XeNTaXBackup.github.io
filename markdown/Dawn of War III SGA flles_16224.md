Has anyone started looking into (un)packing the SGA archives that ships with DoW3?
Any breadcrumbs you could throw my way?
Thank you!

I made my own unpacker durning the beta.
I was able to read all archives but I had some problems and I wasnt able to find some important data in the structure.
The structure itself is similiar to DoW2 SGA files which were V5. DoW3 are V9

I finally got my version of DoW III, any update on the unpacker? 

All I'm interested in are the 3D Models, animations and textures
