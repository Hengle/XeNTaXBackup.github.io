- Post Title: Looking to extract 3D models from Trials Frontier

Hi, I was wondering if there was a way to extract 3D models from the .dat files found in the .obb file for Trials Frontier on Android. There are three files - content.dat, textures-android.dat, and contentSFX.dat. I'm not really sure how these are compressed, I can upload the files if need be. I'm assuming the 3D models are located in content.dat. Thanks for any help you can give!
