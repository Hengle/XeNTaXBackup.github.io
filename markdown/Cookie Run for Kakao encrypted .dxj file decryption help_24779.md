- Post Title: Cookie Run for Kakao encrypted .dxj file decryption help?

Alright, so I need some help trying to get some encrypted text files opened from an old mobile game, Cookie Run for Kakao.

Early versions of the app use a different encryption format, with the extension (.dxj). This file is specifically taken from the 1.44 IPA of the game.

Later on, the encryption was changed around 6.0 as well as the extension, now a .djb. Here's an example taken from the 7.01 ipa of the game.

I know very little about encryption myself, but here's some relevant info for possible leads:

*The game runs on the Cocos2D engine
*Encryption is consistent between iOS (.ipa) and Android (.apk) versions of the game.
*Old encryption type was also used for OvenBreak 2, which has been removed from the app store for 8 years.  Archive of the .ipas is here: [https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/mobi ... irection=a](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/mobile/folders/1IVKyn4QGe0Bo21fj3-EbQn8QSIO9BFEf/1lnJXXUc0NvwfQWhOZUHvUJbshuMx_7lC?sort=13&direction=a)
*You can easily Google .apks for app but it's not so easy for iOS apps (.ipa). Thankfully, a handful of .ipas for the game are preserved here: [https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/ ... sp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/10eh6lygEg3qyjGvBk_vXXs_n9N81NIjI?usp=sharing)
*The encrypted text is located in the "default" folder in OvenBreak 2 and "Kakao_BalanceData" for Kakao.

Thank you very much for any and all help!
