Yes it reads the number of files correctly but it can do nothing elce with it the file names show up as nothing and 0 bytes in size.
I think it just needs to be updated.

(Slight thread necro )

My new plugin platform [Maki](http://maki.turfster.be) + the POP2008 plugin Elika allow you to extract/replace files in the new Prince of Persia for PC.

Crap, you're right. Guess AC is a lot more strict on its files than POP is...

Damn, you're like the first to break the .forge format, ever.. Respect. And i patiently await the sweet moment when we'll be able to extract the audio from PoP and especially Assassin's Creed. Can't wait

New [update](http://maki.turfster.be/) now includes the basic conversion of a couple of mesh types to OBJ files. (thanks to a kick in the head from fatduck)
For the people waiting for audio, that's not my priority, so I suggest using decubisnd, which should work with both games.

listen, i'm very interested init .. translating games in my lang (it's Georgian writes only in Unicode)

so if sometimes u help me to extract from some games text and font files or decode font i will pay for it!
I hope u understand me.

Thank you very much! and all best wishes to u, plz contact me by e-mails
contact details removed by request

If Turfster (or anyone else) does decode fonts, I hope we can read about it here as well. if you want to pay him, by my guest, but most of us do this kind of thing, because we like it.  Why not thank Turfster for his post ("thank post" button)

Sorry, don't really have the time anymore (or the inclination, to be honest) to work on any of my existing code (or any new code) at the moment.
For POP, you should be able to edit the subtitle files and font and replace them in the relevant forge file.
For AC, I'm missing some vital information that prohibits me from writing new forge files that don't make the game crash, so you can't really mod the game.

Hey, turfster, I know you said that you decline any updates on Persianrug, but....

could you maybe try and update your Maki for ripping the old SoT-trilogy and extract the Bin-files? The Persianrug has many issues extracting object files, especially on Sands of Time.On WW and T2T most objects are incomplete, but on SoT no object files from the characters can be extracted.And I want to port Farrah and some other stuff on G-mod...
Porting maps from games won't work either because of this object bug 8/

Here , I posted that issue on a thread a while ago:
[viewtopic.php?f=10&t=3400](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=3400)

Can anyone else using [these tools](http://prince.turfster.be/) from forge-guru  - Turfster  to write a program to convert models with bones (interested in skinning data). Now conversion occurs only in the obj-format.
However, in the case of PersianRug when exporting in the log window shows that the bones are determined!

```
28 textures loaded.
File type : .wow - Prince
1362 blocks.
Done.

And perhaps this message will see Turfster himself and also help! Big thanks.
