Good day, users of XeNTaX!

I'm trying to make Ukrainian localisation for BPR, I have translated the game, but I don't have any experience with creating custom fonts for the game + how to open game's texture files, so I could change them, if possible.

Can someone help me, a beginner translator, or just tell me which apps I should use to look at BPR files?

It looks like the game uses .ttf and just do a search you find editors.

I don't have the game I am saying this because of the website
[https://steamdb.info/depot/1238081/](https://steamdb.info/depot/1238081/)
On this site it shows the names and extensions of the game files.
