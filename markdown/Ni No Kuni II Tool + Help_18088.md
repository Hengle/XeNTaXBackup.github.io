- Post Title: Ni No Kuni II Tool + Help

Update
- UVs are working now

Hello,

I recently started working on the pc version of Ni No Kuni 2. I was able to load the vertex positions and indices, but I need some help with the uvs.

Here is a model of a bird : [http://www.mediafire.com/file/7o76s0c6a ... 01000.g4mg](http://www.mediafire.com/file/7o76s0c6a8cn5bc/a30001000.g4mg)

And here is the first mesh using hex2obj. Other ones are just LODs.



The file starts immediately with the vertex blocks, and every block is 60 bytes. First 3 floats are vertex positions. UVs should also be somewhere in the block, but I couldn't see them. Any help would be appreciated.

-- Tool --

I also started to make a tool. Not really useful atm without the uvs, but I will update it as I discover new stuff. Skeleton data also doesn't look that complicated, but I want to have proper uvs first.

Overview



How to use
- Extract the cpk archives using CriPakTools (or something else) first
- File -> Open to select a file
- Either select the .g4mg or the .g4pkm file. Both files need to in the same folder.

Great, thanks. I need to find a way to convert WORD to float in my code. I think I will check the Make_obj source

I was attempting to use this to convert g4pkm files from Yo-kai Watch 4
This tool can open them and save them as obj but the meshes are exploded, so the vert cords are not correct(not sure how best to put it)

Any chance you could take a look, took me a few hours to figure out how to extract the xci the cpk now im suck :/
