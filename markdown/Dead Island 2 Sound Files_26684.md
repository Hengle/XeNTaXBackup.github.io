- Post Title: Dead Island 2 Sound Files

Just wondering if anybody would be able to extract these? I get as far as opening the audio .pak file in UE Viewer and inputting the AES keys, all the .pak folders are shown but there are no files inside of them! I'm at a loss, and desperate to get my hands on the in-game voice lines! Thank you in advance, and apologies if this is posted in the wrong area!
