- Post Title: TERA File organisation List

Hi guys.

I've been using a tool to view things from TERA recently, and I realised that the base packages directory is a bit of a mess, a ton of folders with 3 letter names.

I thought it might be a good idea to set up a topic that helps people to understand the layout of TERA.

I'm still exploring this format with umodel so so far I've got little to say about it.

So far:

Anything with env in the name is almost entire terrain and environment maps, mostly things like cubemaps.

I'm still trying to work out what each specific folder name means, ie CH, BG (I assume background and Character here).

I specifically got the game to find these tree's, but I'm having trouble finding them, so many folders to search through, which is why I've created this topic.

(I know the top image is Isle of Dawn World Tree)



So far I've discovered the following

CH = Characters
_anim = animation (clearly)
anything with DST in the name appears to be desert
_ENV appears to be only environment maps for the main environment

There are also abbreviations setup for each race so these are mostly self explanatory anyway.

Thats all I've gotten so far, Once I've gotten several things I'll organize the list properly, possibly into text document form so its downloadable.

I'll post more as I learn, if anyone else knows anything about the folder structure then please post it here so we can build a mini document. (Also if anyone knows where to find those specific tree's and that giant statue tree thing... that would really help me.

(also this may be in the wrong section, I was a little unsure but this seemed the most logical, please move it if its in the wrong place).

Thanks

Dan

*update*

_SL = terrain (including some materials)
_terrain = terrain materials
_water = water including environment reflection maps
