- Post Title: Lego Batman 2 DC Super Heroes database

I'm compiling a list of found information on the game Lego Batman 2 by Traveller's Tales in the format I've seen done elsewhere and sharing it around in the hopes it can be of some use to anyone and/or used for game modification/and editor down the lines. LB2DSH shares a lot in common with previous Lego games by TT as research would suggest as well as with The Chronicles of Narnia The Lion The Witch and The Wardrobe by the same company.

other notes:
- The game was promoted as having downloadable content which was system dependent and specific to negotiations. But, upon examining the files in both the PC version and demo all of the files for the DLC are actually contained within the game natively, not a separate entity that's brought into the game itself, whereas unlockable instead (ex: Bizarro, Captain Cold, Black Adam, Black Manta, Gorilla Grodd, Nightwing, Shazam, Katana, Zatanna, and Damian Wayne.). Also both PC versions contain files specific to other platforms and are labelled as such (Wii, PS3, XBOX360, etc). As well there is additional character data contained within, the character Darkseid for example. I've found that the PC versions of the game contain files pertaining to the additional characters found within the handheld versions of the game as well (increases the character roster from 60 to 85).
- The demo contains most of the files for the full game character and asset wise despite these files actually being usable or not in playing the demo itself.
- Likewise as can be found elsewhere, the TT Lego games appear to store information in a " piggybacked " manner, whereas one file is adjacent to another (see image example).
- It seems agreed upon that model and bone data is stored within .ghg files, though I'm not fully convinced these are the only files needed to examine 3d model data myself (see above). This file type seems to be a relative unknown online. Research into TT's ever expanding job listings page suggests that modelling is done first in Maya. Also noted from this page is that TT games make use of C++, Python, SQL, and Java as well as making use of Direct X, Open GL and home system dependent languages.

- Further research indicates that TT's does release it's SDK and development packages for use to the public. Blockade Entertainment has developed a Lego Batman short entitled How To Build A Perfect Bat Trap in association with WB and McDonalds. On their page they claim the game engine and assets were made available to them via TT's for their production.

All for now, I hope any of this helps anyone who stumbles upon it. I personally believe this game and it's sisters are completely editable it's just a matter of getting the rightly versed individuals interested in working on a larger project. Have fun.
