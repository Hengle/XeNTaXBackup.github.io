- Post Title: BASPACK: Travelogue 360

Used the BASPACK Unpacker/Packer [Drawn-Dark_Flight_PAK_unpacker_1.0.zip by XpoZed] (and command line version by bacter) on various BASPACK archives. Never experienced any problems:
1. BASPACK - Drawn: The Painted Tower - Archive et.al.
2. BASPACK - Travelogue 360 (both Rome and London).

BASPACK - Travelogue 360 Paris doesn't work.

The attached BASPACK file seems to predate the BASPACK evolutionary line and fails to open using the unpacker.

I will appreciate any help I may receive to unpack this archive.

Regards, and thanx!
