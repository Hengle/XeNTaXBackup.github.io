- Post Title: [PC] FIFA Online 4 database dat file

Hi and hello.

I need a hand to decrypt/decompress this dat file:
[https://drive.google.com/open?id=1SlVTc ... SOOAlMZX58](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1SlVTcblwjA25vQbZYrn5-9SOOAlMZX58)

It is the fo4_ng_db.dat file of EA Sports FIFA Online 4.

It should include the usual xml file descriptor along with the fifa_ng_db.db database file, unsure which other files it might include.
Also, I am not sure if it is a crypted/compressed BIG archive file or what.

The algorithm should be a 64bit block cipher algorithm without ivec like blowfish or *tea.

Not sure if game exe is also needed or what.

Neither. The format relies on a dictionary + offset
Find one of the fifa editors and use ilspy to decompile the code
