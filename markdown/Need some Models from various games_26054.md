- Post Title: Need some Models from various games

Ok, I'll start off with the simplest emulators and games first and work my way to the toughest. I recently hit a snag: none of the model rippers are working with any of the emulators I try - or at least for the computer I'm currently using. So now, I need help to rip some models from specific games while I try to figure out what's wrong with my PC.

Ok, here's the problem everyone: you know that "ready to capture" text that appears at the top left corner of the emulator you're ripping from? Well, that's the problem. It's not appearing even though I did everything correctly to get this program running. Has anybody else experienced not seeing "ready to capture" while using Ninja Ripper/3D Ripper DX to rip from emulators? And if so, how did you fix your problem to be able to rip models? That is why I need to resort to someone else to help me rip these models while I try to figure out what's wrong with my PC.

Crisis Beat for PS1:
The Crane enemies with their assault rifles, the weapon case that's only interacted with twice in the whole game, the health suitcase that replenishes 25% health, the health cylinder that replenishes 50% health, the health case that replenishes 100% health, the machine gun that the player uses, the small machine gun Troop uses in Eiji and JJ's story, and the bioweapon plus it's computer.

From Nerf N-Strike Elite for the Wii: 
Specter robot, Sentry robot, and the Juggernaut robot.

From Wario World for Gamecube:
The Money Bag that falls on your screen when the game asks if you want to continue playing the level.

From Sly Cooper: Thieves in Time (PS3):
The searchlight, Tennessee's gun, Sly Cooper's cane, and Carmelita's shock pistol.

From Crash Bandicoot The Wrath of Cortex (PS2):
These all are from the level That Sinking Feeling: the ship, the enemy plane, and that turret.
