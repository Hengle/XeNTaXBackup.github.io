I have made the script:
[http://aluigi.org/papers/bms/o3pk.bms](http://aluigi.org/papers/bms/o3pk.bms)

some notes:
- I will upload the script on my website later, in the meantime I have attached it to this post
- you MUST use the -9 option of quickbms or it will not work
- the OFFSET sorting function takes time so wait patiently
