OKay, that was an easy one. 

This I got out of it (as just an example)


Use the "Use custom BMS on..." option in MultiEx Commander to open *.DPK files. 

Get this BMS script to run it and extract those that are Zlib compressed as uncompressed files:
[http://www.xentax.com/downloads/tools/dpk.bms](http://www.xentax.com/downloads/tools/dpk.bms)

Get this script to extract all files as saved in the DPK (if they are compressed they will not be decompressed):
[http://www.xentax.com/downloads/tools/dpk_com.bms](http://www.xentax.com/downloads/tools/dpk_com.bms)

Captain is right, that's not going to work, buster.   

For the DEFINITE answer I downloaded the Project Earth demo which has one HUGE *.DPK file, I downloaded the above mentioned scripts and they worked PERFECTLY on the new *.DPK file I got. 7092 files in that huge file. 

Make sure you FIRST select the BMS , THEN select the *.DPK file from within MultiEx Commander's "Use custom BMS on..."-option. 

The *.DPK format uses ZLib compression on most, but not all resources (for reasons unbeknownst to me, ZLib probably did not achieve enough compression on some files, or it was just a sloppy employee at work). 

Anyway, it will have to be with MultiEx Commander, I will not create a new program just for you.

Buster = Bozo, 

And, I advise you NOT to use mexbinder.exe, but to use Multiex Commander. Do exactly as I explained in the above.

Even after Mr. Mouse helped you out (for free!), you demanded a custom tool written just for you. That's quite the opposite of polite.

Yes, I will add the option to import/replace files in the archives with the release of a new MultiEx Commander that is due somewhere next month probably. I tested it in my release candidate, and it works. Just hold your breath until then.
