Can someone help identify this ea audio format? looks like xas but the header i cannot completely understand and the normal xas header will not work with the file.

It's another adpcm variation. There are 2 types of headers - possibly for stereo and for multichanel.
Your file is truncated 0x34 bytes from the begining. 
I think it was useful header, not just junk. There are many files with same header.

But still i am not sure any tool at the moment can decode this new variant.
