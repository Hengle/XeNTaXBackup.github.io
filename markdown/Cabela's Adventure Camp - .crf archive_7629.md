- Post Title: Cabela's Adventure Camp - *.crf archive

Hi guys!
Looking at the crf archive from Cabela's Adventure Camp I thought it to be quite easy to write a script for. Apparently I was wrong because something seems to be wrong with the given file sizes in the info area. Could anyone please take a look at this cut file: [http://www.gamefront.com/files/20959089/sounds.crf_cut](http://www.gamefront.com/files/20959089/sounds.crf_cut)
Even looking at the RIFF files shows that the sizes are somehow wrong... Thanks for helping me out here!
