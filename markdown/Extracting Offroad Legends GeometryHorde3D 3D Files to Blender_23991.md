hey, I just got through extracting the popular rage game "Offroad Legends" with QuickBMS, and I'm trying to export every car model to Unity3D
using Blender 2.79, but I can't figure out how to convert the files to OBJ format online, so I thought "why not ask XeNTaX?" if someone could help me that would be really helpful

if you have already extracted every model in the folder, then I'm going to ask you "do you have to change any info on the GEO files to be able to get it converted or not? what lines did you change?" and no, I can't blame you for refusing   really I can't.

Dang it!!  that stupid quick bms plugin keeps corrupting the files!  the models aren't even separated too   
you know what, screw it!! I'm starting to think you're the only person capable of solving things like this.
could you at least tell me how to perfectly extract everything to where it's not corrupted and the models are separated as well?
please, do this for me   

but remember this: I use Blender 2.79 for modeling and stuff, so just keep that in mind   

the data is right here : [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1y3GXJf ... WHTF5/view](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1y3GXJfW4ywmGZFogzk8eX9ARSxHWHTF5/view)

the tutorials are pointless, so please do not ask me to do watch one.

Your Google drive sharing was not set correctly, I can't download the content directly.

If I remember correctly, I used the Ekey's solution:

I'm sorry that my link is no good, Google Drive is the only thing I have to post links 

but before I go, I need to ask you a question, so how did you setup the unpacker?
did you download the source code or the binary version of the app?
Ekey seems to be very busy right now, so I thought maybe you can show me how you do this.

The fastest way is the binary version of the program.

Just extract it to a folder and run the DB.XPAK.Unpacker.bat.
It shows that how to use the unpacker.

I have deleted my game already, so I can't use it currently.

I don't know what is the zombie safari, but I have downloaded the data.xpk from your Google sharing and the DB.XPAK.Unpacker.exe worked fine.

The dogbyte_xpk.bms file does not work on your file.

why? is it that DB.XPAK.Unpacker requires a the source code to work?
what do I have to do to get DB.XPAK.Unpacker to work correctly!?!
this is just a load of bull!

no, not at all, I just extracted zombie safari's obb file from an XAPK file I downloaded off of APKPure.com , the file you have is the data from Offroad Legends.
I tried following the example on the screen "DB.XPAK.Unpacker D:\main.33.com.dogbytegames.zombiesafari.obb D:\Unpacked" but every time it doesn't work, I just don't understand, am I doing something wrong?

nope, it's working now, but THE TEXTURES ARE STILL CORRUPTED!! except for 60% of the the textures.
I mean I can't convert the textures because they're corrupted.
let me see if the models are fine

The .png texture files from your data.xpk are not real PNG files.
These are PVR files with .png extension.

Press 'F3' and '3' on your .png file using the Total Commander to see the (different) first bytes.
