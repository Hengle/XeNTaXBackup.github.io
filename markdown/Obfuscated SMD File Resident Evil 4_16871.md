- Post Title: Obfuscated SMD File? Resident Evil 4

I've recently been digging through some files in The RE4 Ultimate HD edition as this edition has extra debug files as well as unused content compared to others.

However, one file has me stumped as it is an SMD file which is the model format for the game. However, it seems to have absolutely no model data! It wouldn't load in blender, So i decided to look at it in a hex editor.

Compared to other SMD files. It appears to be obfuscated or otherwise unviewable.

For example. The beginning of a different SMD file.

version 1..nodes..   0   "bone_0"   and more model data.

In this file however.

1... 6...P..`{..................

And so on. Other files from the same level are not like this.

No other models in the game seem to be like this. So I am curious what it is as it is located in a beta folder.

If someone with more expertise with this could kindly take a look at the file and possibly help me get it to a readable state that would be fantastic! Thank you.
