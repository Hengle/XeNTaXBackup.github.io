- Post Title: Devil May Cry 4: Special Edition - .sngw audio

Tell me how you can decode the format sngw to wav and from wav to sngw? 
Earlier in DMC4 format was OGG, and now it is unclear what this format is unpacked. 
For example, here's all the sounds. [https://mega.nz/#!r5lxgAqJ!r9AH3RGQ7y_W ... FoGoQjrs84](https://mega.nz/#!r5lxgAqJ!r9AH3RGQ7y_WeBk5M1reLx8EHFvoEjDnzFoGoQjrs84)
Can you help with this problem?
