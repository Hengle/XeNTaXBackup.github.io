Those STR files are archives with EA SCHl Audio in them [http://wiki.xentax.com/index.php/EA_SCHl_Audio](http://wiki.xentax.com/index.php/EA_SCHl_Audio)

There are some tools listed on the wiki, you can check them out.
Multiple audio files are stored in one STR files, so you may need some quickbms script to split them by "SCHl" signature.
