First off, please fix your Caps-Lock key, it's rather annoying. Secondly, which version of MexCom are you using?

Please make a screenshot of the the Register window and attach it here. 

Also, please attach the debug log (debug.log) in the data directory of MultiEx Commander after you start up. Can you also try and select the WIKI database (see Options) and tell me what happens?

Hmm, I don't see the pic. Just zip the debug.log and picture and attach that here. Just click Add an attachment, select the zip file and click submit.
