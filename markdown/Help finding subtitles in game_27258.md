- Post Title: Help finding subtitles in game

I'm learning how to use games to translate into my language and I would like you to help me with three Nintendo Switch games (Dragon Quest 1, 2 and 3) (Digimon Cyber ​​Sleuth Complete Edition)(Star Ocean First Departure) the files have the DAT extension . Can someone please recommend me a tool to extract these files?
