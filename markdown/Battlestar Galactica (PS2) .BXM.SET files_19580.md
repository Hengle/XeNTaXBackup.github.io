- Post Title: Battlestar Galactica (PS2) *.BXM/*.SET files

Hi, anyone able to play/convert this / extract samples from tracker files or something? It should be some mutant MOD variant according to [game credits](https://www.mobygames.com/game/ps2/battlestar-galactica/credits).
[Here you can find examples](https://mega.nz/#!ZMdH3CwC!i7M_oqKtkQsai148ZGTtPk47PJqtkI3C0Ss8s1cXxuQ).
Good luck with them!
