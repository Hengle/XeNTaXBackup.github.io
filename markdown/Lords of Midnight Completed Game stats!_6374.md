- Post Title: Lords of Midnight Completed Game stats!

So I took the challenge of writing a [Lords of Midnight Wrapper for CCS64](http://www.xentax.com/?p=300) the past days, and play a full game. Yesterday I completed the game, for the second time in my life, the first time some 20 years ago.

As it is one of my all time favourites it was a bit like coming home. This time around it took me 112 turns, because I had to make sure I'd win. I wanted to see the dynamics of the game, by ways of stats, and visually show the AI's strategy.

This post is about the stats. Here's the charts of the full game.

As you can see, this is a game against great odds. Doomdark starts with a massive amount of units, and looking at the turns, it takes a great deal of time for these odds to equal out. The Free (me) never reach those dazzling numbers of units. The chart shows the total number of units, those garrisoned added to the roaming armies. Note that Doomdark has 128 roaming armies at the start each having 1000+ warriors or riders, and the player starts of with just 4 individuals that need to recruit Lords with their armies and garrisoned units from friendly Keeps and Citadels.

Instead, as the chart shows above, I've played the game defensively, recruiting the Lords of Midnight as quickly as possible and moving them to a few, but utterly vital strategic locations to dig in against the onslaught that starts around turn 10. They then "wait this one out". Note in the chart the dramatic swiftness of recruitment of Lords and their armies. You need to be quick if you want to win the game!

The chart depicts the number of riders and warriors of Doomdark. Note the delay between the armies with warriors and those with riders. Armies with riders can move a greater distance per turn and hence reach the front sooner. The clashes with Doomdarks' riders start therefore around turn 9 or 10, while the battles with Doomdarks' warriors commence some 10 turns later. As the Citadel of Ushgarak (Doomdark's Capitol) lies surrounded with mountains, warrior armies also have a greater movement penalty.

The game has 102 Keeps and Citadels were units are and can be garrisoned. The chart shows the number of units there of the Free (me) and Doomdark. It is clear Doomdark was on a rampage against The Free, with The Free's number of units at these structures decimated to rock bottom at turn 28. However, from then on I started Operation Payback as you can see from the reclaimed garrisons.

This final chars shows that neatly. Doomdarks conquest is halted at turn 28 when I start the offence. 

By the way, Morkin was completely useless as he got himself killed at the night of the third day (after turn 3) by stumbling like an idiot into Doomdark's 107th Regiment in the Forest of Shadows not far from his starting point.

And here's a video of how you actually play the game. [http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x6lmva ... videogames](http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x6lmva_c64-lords-of-midnight_videogames)

"3D", no minimap, no map at all for that matter. You just see through the eyes of those characters you control/recruit.
