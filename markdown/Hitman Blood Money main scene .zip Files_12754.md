- Post Title: Hitman: Blood Money main scene *.zip Files

I was looking at the scene files inside the .zip archives from Blood Money, and there are already some tools to edit/extract files, such as models, localisation and sounds, but also many undocumented files:
ANM - Animations? (magic word: "MNA")
BUF - ?
GMS - ?
LOC - Strings/Localisation ("Hitman 4 LOC Un-/Packer by Csaba Varga", "Hitman: Contracts .LOC Tool v1.1 Beta")
MAT - Materials?
OCT - ?
PRM - Models ("PRM to OBJ Converter 0.3")
PRP - ? (magic word: "IOPacked v0.1")
RMC - ?
RMI - ?
SGD - ? (always the same: "FFFFFFFFCDCDCDCD")
SGP - ?
SND - Sounds?
SUP - ? (always the same: "00000000180000801800000001000000444C434608000000")
TEX - Textures ("Glacier TEX Editor" (BM/HC))
ZGF - ? (always the same: "0800000011000000015446475A08000000")
Most of the tools can be downloaded here: [http://download.elberethzone.net/hmc/](http://download.elberethzone.net/hmc/)
The other tools are in the attachments.
The demo of Blood Money contains the full tutorial level without edits: [http://www.gamershell.com/download_13964.shtml](http://www.gamershell.com/download_13964.shtml)

Is there any more info available especially for files containing scripts and maps?

Is it in any way possible to extract the whole Map? The extraction to obj cut it in thousand of useless pieces
