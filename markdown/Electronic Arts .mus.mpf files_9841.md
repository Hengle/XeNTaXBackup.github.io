Does anyone have any information about the format of Electronic Arts .mus and .mpf files?
I find lots of people asking for info or tools but no actual tools or info.

Sorry to bump this, but I would like to second the request for information.

In particular for me, I'm trying to extract music from The Godfather: The Game, and according to [this website](http://mixonline.com/mag/audio_musical_world_godfather/), it was recorded in 48k/24 bit, although trying to import the music archive into audacity results in mostly static (although some music can still be heard).

I've tried a c++ program on here that is supposed to convert the music into ASF files automatically, although that results in hundreds of static-filled music files as well.

I just wanted to update my findings on this topic:

[This topic](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=17&t=2685&start=45) has been a long going one which covers the extraction of MUS files.

For my specific project (getting the music from The Godfather: The Game), [I downloaded an EA audio & video decoder](http://www.ppmsite.com/forum/download.php?id=29526), then I ran it with the .mus file as a parameter. Out came about one thousand wav files, all of which are playable.

Now I just have to splice them!

It doesn't work with the PS3 version, though that got higher bitrate files.
