- Post Title: Hitman Blood Money for Xbox

Sorry, not sure where to post this info, or if you even want it posted, but I have some exciting news for any Xbox owners that have Hitman Blood Money.  

I've finally finished working on my program that will let you edit the weapons in your save file.  

You can download the program from my website:
