- Post Title: Texmod: Possible to use when game required to use launcher?

Hello Xenizens.

Right now I'm trying to rip files from Blacklight Retribution. Alas, after the latest patch, UE Model Viewer displays textures for the game as all black. I was hoping I could get around this using Texmod to extract what I need but another change made during the patch is that you now need to login through the launcher instead of just using it for updates. So, I can launch the game without the launcher but can't actually make it past the first screen (can't find the sever without first logging in) and all the textures TexMod shows are super low-rez and not of any use except for a few icons.

So, I'm wondering if there's anyway to setup Texmod to somehow listen for when the game itself launches so I can run the launcher like normal and arrive at the game itself with Texmod ready and intercepting textures?

Thanks for any help.
