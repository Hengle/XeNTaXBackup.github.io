- Post Title: Please read/unzip the format file * .pack

- The situation is that I don't know how to extract the * .pack file so I can edit the language in it.
Who has studied and has decompression software reading .pack file format does not provide me with research.
For example, the file I need to extract here. Download file
I am really grateful.

Software I want to talk about you in this link. [https://www.ispringsolutions.com/ispring-suite](https://www.ispringsolutions.com/ispring-suite)
In previous versions, the language file existed, but recently they bundled in the .pack file
(Languages on the software toolbar)
