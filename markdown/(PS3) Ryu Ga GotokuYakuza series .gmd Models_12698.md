Looks like Yakuza 3 and 4 and 5 use the same engine, which is Magical-V Engine, the games use a model format called .gmd, same one as Binary Domain, however, chrrox has released a beta script in 2012, although it doesn't support bones, due to the lack of interest, no news have been heard, the script works fine, just without the support of bones.
( a custom rigged Kiryu from Yakuza 5 by eddiehimselfstolemyu ) 


here's the beta script by chrrox that needs an update to support bones : 
[viewtopic.php?f=16&t=8891](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=8891)

here's a sample to work on: Saejima from Yakuza 5 with (maybe all) textures:

Game uses some pretty cool models, I hope someone will update the script :

It's no fun to build a skeleton with 116 bones without the names even with the parent IDs known.

Is there an accompanying file with bone names in it?

Well there are these bone files in .gmd format, but I've not had any luck trying to extract any them using the current noesis script. The model starts c_cm or am (can't remember which), so I'm guessing the corresponding bone file would be the one in there that also begins with c_cm or c_am

As, you can see here [viewtopic.php?f=16&t=8891&start=30](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=8891&start=30) Cra0 wrote whole standalone tool for all Yakuza and Binary Domain games. Format is totally understandable and not hard, thought I can't see any sense for anyone to make tool/script or plugin if someone else did all the job already. I suggest you to wait for release of Cra's tool

I know, it's just there hasn't been much in the way of updates recently. I was hoping if he could see there was interested it might get him motivated to get it done

Ah, then I'm totally supporting this!   Cra0, if you're reading this - we all patiently waiting for your tool

If someone is willing to help me figure out the LOD groups please contact me and lets get this thing done I've figured out everything except the lods!
Though I'm currently translating my code to c# so need to get that done first.
Like I said in my previous posts no one has had interest in this so I sort of lost interest too but not totally.

Don't know the game but screenshots totally screams gold. I hope it doesn't take $500 to make this happen.

I would love to help, but sadly I know shit all about this sort of thing   All I do know is that when I import this stuff into 3DS Max, the models always have 3 sets of the same geometry, and certain characters have one or 2 sets of med/low LOD meshes as well.

Cra0, I will gladly try my best to help you with LODs   We all should get those awesome models!

Yes, and I would really like to be able to extract vehicle and environment models as well

I should imagine the PS4 version will probably use a new model format... I may have to give the PS3 version a download to see what the formats are.

Has anyone figured out how to get files off PS4 games yet? Knowing them they most likely use the same initial structure.

MagicalVEngine hasn't changed since yakuza 3

Will be helping Cra0 on this as well. Been on my 'to do' list for much too long.

Does anyone know if Chroxx script will do props and environment models? Or is it only the characters that're supporter/in .gmd format?

You can extract some environment/vehicle/weapon models but sadly they're not UV mapped so a lot of work if you want to be able to use them. Also some of the LOD meshes have terrible geometric distortions.

Mostly i can't see any textures in scenes, it loads a texture but then the mapping is a bit screwed. For props this is less true as some like the pigeon look nearly OK, but large screens crash because of too many textures or have distorted geometries. The few large scenes that load fine look like they have "basic materials" instead of textures even though it seems to load the dds. 

Maybe a texture scaling problem or so? I think sometimes it refuses to tile the texture and instead just pulls a giant pixel all over the model or so?






On the karaoke scene you can see pretty well that the texture size/scale might be the problem... Look at the wallpaper...





Just compare with how small the wall decal should be from the original...

I think this is the same issue with UV mapping I mentioned before. If you look at the other textures like the ceiling and carpet, they definitely don't look as if they've been UV mapped at all...
