- Post Title: MiniFighter SPR format

I got a request via email for SPR format analysis, of this game [http://www.gamershell.com/download_49622.shtml](http://www.gamershell.com/download_49622.shtml)

I took a quick look at the SPR files and they seem to have a header of 0x50 in size, the last 8 bytes being the width and size. 

This is followed by a bitmap of 16-bit colourcoded pixels. Of course, you need to know the palette used, to get the right colours, I would say. 

Here's a few examples.

Mr. Mouse. I think was me who requested this email. If you have a little more time, please analyze the .spr files inside the .ARK files(just .ZIP files). This files have a different structure and i don't know how extract that. Thanks, sorry rise this topic and my english   .
I opened the example above in TextureFinder but I want to open with color in PS:

An example:

Edit:
The structure is the same, I got to extract the files. Thanks for the youtube videos, they helped me a lot.
