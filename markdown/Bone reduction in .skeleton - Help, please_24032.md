- Post Title: Bone reduction in .skeleton - Help, please

Hello folks, I hope not to disturb.

I am working on mods for Assassin's Creed 4 and I have had problems with a skeleton of a mesh that is very large and the game crashes. Would someone help me reduce this skeleton? The skeleton has 28 bones and I would like to reduce it to 10 bones. If someone knows how to model mesh and skeleton, could you help me? I would appreciate it very much, greetings.

Files come in .mesh and .skeleton
