No point, the game use UE3, just wait till 19 or after and gildor will update his uModel and you can get it. Hes not going to update the app till the official release date.

Gildor reversed the format. 
No skeletal mesh support for PS3, unfortunately.

Kalil,


I have every file from the Kratos.XXX archive with thanks to gildor's Unreal Package Extractor. I believe kratos's model is in a file called CHAR_Kratos-a9de1b13.Package.


it is in .Package format apparently and i have no idea how to convert it.

this is not unreal skeletalmesh but a custom ps3 viftag format , just like ps2 vifinfos, each mesh part is splitted in a rendercall block to push a certain amount of vertices to the vertex unit just like in this bleach soul ignition ps3 game :


so the vertex don't use any indices here, they just come in order, i will try to do a quick export of it   

each block section start with :

```
then you got 2 word :
datacount
unknow
then the data array ...

```


also i noticed  quickly the vertex size is 23 bytes each :
xyz as sshort
etc...

At the moment only Gildor know hows to import psa/psk model files using his actorx plugin for 3dsm. The ps3 version of the models are not supported in his app at this stage. 

The formats are also different between consoles, tried putting kratos into the 360 version but the game doesn't load the model.
