I would also like to know this, so far I have been able to extract the audio packages (.nub2) by using alexfilth's method over at the hcs64 forum 
"Use the advanced cutter of vgmtoolbox and then use the riff style header preset and .at3 as output file extension." 
And afterwards just decode it to .aa3 and using ffmpeg to make it .mp3

Now upon unpacking "partition_op_character_ps3.cpk" there's these .pak files inside (battle_character_sound folder)
that contain once more the .nub2 header(and a few others apperantly), but I don't know of a way to extract ONLY the .nub2 from the package I provided below:
