- Post Title: LPK File - Dead Rising Chop Til You Drop, Wii

This game uses LPK files, opening them in a hex editor shows the files I want (brres), but I don't know what to do about it. I need to re-pack the LPKs afterwards, if possible. Thanks

Thanks, I've seen that. That guide says to remove some header info to get a working BRRES file. I imagine the LPK can be repacked by re-inserting the header info?

Thanks for your help
