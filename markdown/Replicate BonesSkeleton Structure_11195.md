- Post Title: Replicate Bones/Skeleton Structure

Hi! I want to ask if there is some way to replicate bones and skeleton structures and skin data of an animated model, with "clean" bones (like manually creating the skeletal structure and skinning), but just kind of duplicate them with the "create bone" functuion of 3ds max for example?
