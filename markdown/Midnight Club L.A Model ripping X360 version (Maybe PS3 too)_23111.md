- Post Title: Midnight Club L.A Model ripping? X360 version (Maybe PS3 too)

Hi to the one reading this, and just came here to say.... is there any way to decrypt the files of the game? i tried looking at em myself but... i saw in some posts that is possible to open em but is one of those games that have a hard as fuck complex encryption into em, and thing is, i feel that the files might have the same file structure like Midnight Club 3, which also i already know how to rip from those even the tracks but.... idk how to get to open the files of L.A and instead got nothing :/, or like i get some stuff but it looks nothing like MC3 file structuring

an example of MC3 models is gonna be in the attachments

but anyways, i am wanting to look into this but thing is like... there is so little to no info about how to do this, only thing i recall is posts saying how some FiveM guys got to rip the map but nothing else out of that...

Here some Sample files for people to look on

i apprecitate if you take time to look into this, and if yall wanted i could get requests out of this, i might be slow but i promise

second pic of the skyline

Note: the sides were splitted to be their own models, which in this version you are seeing they don't look splitted or sharp, is cuz i think in the game the shaders hide it so good that is impossible to notice,

Of course there is. But why create another topic? [viewtopic.php?f=16&t=20684&p=158732](https://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=20684&p=158732)

You can decrypt the main RPF archives, of Max Payne 3, Red Dead Redemption and Midnight Club L.A. PS3/X360, i personally recommend PS3.
And it can extract them too, but no one has ever figured out the models yet alone full map, as i am interested as well in the map, so yeah.
After decrypting the main archives, there's a big chance the assets inside are again encrypted or compressed maybe? I personally do not know for sure.
But more info has been posted in link above.
Tool to decrypt/extract you can find it here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxxZFfN35Xg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxxZFfN35Xg)

Thankies for answering! and man, goddmanit, like, thing is i got to get the files but i never knew if anybody decrypted the files inside it, aside they look compressed/Encrypted again, mainly the cars and others which, i know about the other post but thing is there is little to nothing in there kinda, aside of just that screenshot of somebody being able to port the map to FiveM which... i still don't know how they did, it might been some years kinda but, at this rate it thought some people would looked more deep into it, i still do wonder if some people got to do progress in ones like MC3 now, which so far i got in that but, i wanna get some of L.A cuz of the quality and all, guess we will never know for a while is my bet :/
