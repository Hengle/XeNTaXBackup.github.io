- Post Title: [PS2] Rogue Galaxy

So I came across a PS2 game that uses a rather weird header structure for the archive files. Case in point, here's a sample(I used filecutter.bms script for the bigger files):
[https://mega.nz/#!gYFkWThL!fHeU821O25Rw ... DfyV-P3kYY](https://mega.nz/#!gYFkWThL!fHeU821O25RweOe0uRMifYRpFYuC9lBMNDfyV-P3kYY)

Included are the .HD6 files, which has these weird structures and are obviously connected to the archive file(.DAT) in some way. Is there any way to figure this out?
