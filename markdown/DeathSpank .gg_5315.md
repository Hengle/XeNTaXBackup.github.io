So what after you extract them? I was hoping to get the sound files for voice and effects/music, using that thing to extract em just makes zip files that say damaged and files with no extension.

I am able to extract all files with full names, but for now all files are encrypted (except Movies) and I'm still trying to decrypt file content. It is only simple xor method, but I'm still missing the right key

Re-download my extraction tool (little update inside)

```
http://raptor.cestiny.cz/download/deathspank-gg-files-extractor.html
```

and extract fsb files. All FSB files are new encrypted FSB4 version files. 

To decrypt use available tool

```
http://hcs64.com/files/guessfsb03.zip
```

and use passphrase "leakyroof831" (without quotes)

```
decfsb.exe AmbienceStreams.fsb AmbienceStreams_NEW.fsb leakyroof831
...
etc.

```

Here it is - unpacker/packer for base Deathspank game

```
http://raptor.cestiny.cz/download/deathspank-gg-files-extractor.html
```


Open original gg file, select "Patch" button, enter new filename, select folder with modified files (only modified files) and wait. Save file with new filename. Overwrite original file is not possible now - because of data streaming. This tool si NOT for DeathSpank TOV. Wait for new one. TOV has different data files.

Page is not in english for now, sorry. But you will find out download link 

Use it, test it, enjoy it.

Well, yes I do  I have simple textdict editor. It is able to export texts to xml and import translated xml back to original format. But this tool is not finished for public release (not localised, not bug free, crappy design etc ). Maybe I have to finish it 

tin files are dds only texture pack.

Hey there!

Thanks for all your tools. I'm not rushing you too, but with the textdict editor you can insert a longer text into the game and it doesn't crash?

I'm asking because I made some tests and it supports unicode characters (via Hex Editing), but I can't write longer text into it, or else it will crash.

I hope your editor will solve this problem 

...also what are in those .tin files? I just want to dub the game and translate the text.

Indeed, that's what editors are made for  You can freely translate texts and all indexes, offsets etc are regenerated to original format.

I have no tin editor but there are just DDS files (without header) inside.

Well so I think I will prepare translator for public release to give you a chance to translate DeathSpank in easy way

No, I'm not giving source codes for download. But I think it is not needed for you. If you are developer, you can made your own tools. All you need is to know data structure. Everything is about reading values from files and writing back, that's all

Well, so as I said before, here is my DeathSpank TextDict Translator.

```
http://raptor.cestiny.cz/download/deathspank-textdict-translator.html
```

This version is not so finished to be the best with all comfort, but it works and I don't have much time to finish it. It is used on my own for game translation and if you want to test it, go for it. Just open textdict file, use Export all to xml from Data menu, translate file in excel or somewhere and use Import from xml. It is better then translating in editor window 

Any question or problem? Just send me PM or anything

Maybe you are trying to select original gg file as output one?
-Open gg file
-Select Patch button
-Enter NEW filename - don't try to overwrite input file
-Select root folder with extracted files (with original directory structure like extractor made). File names are compared with full name.

ehm, yes  I have "GONT convert tool", but it is not fully tested. I will do it asap. It converts gont to dds and xml with config (size, positions, kernings, etc) and back to gont.

ASCII export is just for my Czech tests - it removes diacritics . If you want to display all other characters, you have to change font files. There are only base characters.

I've made some translations, but some text can't be found in the textdict files and if I do find them then they don't get translated. I mean I translate them, they are translated everywhere, but when I'm playing then ingame it's not translated.

I think this might be a bug in the program or the extractor or something...

What text are you talking about? Any example?
What I know there are Build\Data\*.datadict files containing all texts from textdict files. Maybe your text is hardcoded here with different ID or something and is ignored in main dictionary.

EDIT:
Bah, seems that some text are hardcoded in Build\*.gob files and they are not taken from dictionaries. I have no idea how many strings are taken from gob files, but the better way how to handle this will be just translate it in hexeditor. I don't think I'm going to make any editor for gob files. They are some compiled scripts or triggers maybe? No idea.

In DeathSpank, I found only three sentences in datadict files, which doesn't too bad IMHO.
In ToV, don't know.

Very good tool ! but like Fenris93, characters like "è,é,à,ù and more" not works. With your textdictranslator, "élève" become "Ã©lÃ¨ve", "français" -> "franÃ§ais" etc.

i'll try to change font files but i dont know how to do that and where to do that. I'm sad.

Hmm, it looks like bad reading of utf8 text format. I'll try to check it again. I know there is for example some russian version with strings saved as unicode and encrypted, so maybe i have to save all texts as unicode instead of utf8.

Well and my GONT tool is almost ready to release.

Well well, there is little bug in my textdic translator. It is unable to read utf8 edited text files. I didn't find it before because I'm not using this tool for translating. There is much quicker way how to translate:

1) Open ORIGINAL (not translated) textdict file
2) Export everything to xml file
3) Open xml file in Excel
4) Edit strings
5) Save file back to xml
6) Import translated items back to translator and save new textdict file

It is the best way how to do it now. Just avoid to open translated file in translator again, or texts will be screwed. Sorry for that. I'll try to fix it asap.

EDIT: So here is new version, but as I said before, don't try to use damaged textdict files, if you will see any bad strings. It is because text was saved in bad format and there is no way how to fix it. If you have translated xml file with correct texts, just import it.

Hi, I don't have any DLC, but problem is, that filepath is stored as "full path" and output path for extracting is just YOUR_DIR + internal_path. And there is just c:\... value. I'll try to do some workaround for that but it is strange. It works in game? Is there any chance to get this dlc?

Hi,

To do a complete translation, I wanna translate the map of the game, and I have no idea of which file is this, and how to edit it. Can anyone help?

Here's a pic of the game map:

If I remember, there are some strings hardcoded in *.gob files (scripts) and little more is in *.tin files. There are no editors for these files, but you can try hexedit gob files.

I just added to my web site gont tool. It is not perfect and you can call it "experimetal". It works almost perfect, but there is problem with outlined font (InterfaceFontOutline.gont). Maybe my output DDS type is wrong, I have no idea. But editing and inserting back to game screwed font with wrong background. But I dn't care. I just replaced this font with another one and all is ok 

DeathSpank GONT Convert Tool v1.0
[http://raptor.cestiny.cz/download/death ... -tool.html](http://raptor.cestiny.cz/download/deathspank-gont-convert-tool.html)

If you want to use it, just convert gont files to xml+dds pair and then edit xml files and redraw dds images. I think gont is little modified version of BMFont export. You can add new characters to xml and edit dds resolution. Don't forget to change resolutions in xml file based on your dds file. 

Warning: There are NO checks or tests for entered values (characters, x and y positions etc.)  Input DDS must be DXT5 version vith Alpha. If game crashes after font modification, than your font is somehow wrong  That's all

And final note:
CombatFloatFont.gont = TitleFont.gont
FrontEndFont.gont = ChatFont.gont = InterfaceFontNormal.gont
InterfaceFontOutline.gont can be replaced with InterfaceFontNormal.gont

Yes, there is no need to edit fonts for some languages, but someone (includes me) needs to redraw them because of missing chars

I made simple standalone tool to convert tin files for maps to dds and back. You can use it:
[http://raptor.cestiny.cz/download/files ... ool100.rar](http://raptor.cestiny.cz/download/files/utils/TinConvertTool100.rar)

But is is only for map texts, because many things are hardcoded and have no full tin structure. Simply extract files from archive, put this exe to folder \Build\Localized\Art\AreaMaps and convert to dds and then back. There are no errors checks etc. so use on your own risk

Wow, so some people were able to translate the game fully into their language?:O

Guys, did you also have texts, that were in the DialogTome-English and TextTome-English files, but if you translated them, nothing changed ingame? Did you do that part with hex-editing?

Update: I checked the French translation, it has the untranslated strings too (e.g.: the Intro's last sentence: "Or... so he was told.")

Update 2: I tried to use hex-edit on the .gob files, but if I import them back, the game won't even start (no error though), but the process is running.

Yep, my translation too, a pair of sentences are hardcoded... it doesn't too bad.
You must to re-do *.gg files with your edited files.

I'll try the tin converter some day when I have freetime... LOL

Yeah, delutto just told me, the translated lines should be the same length. But did you translate every text in the .gob files? Could you give me a list on which ones to translate (e.g.: in the Intro, only the last sentence should be translated in the .gob file)?

There is no need to edit gob files. All texts (except 3 what i remember) are in textdict and tin files.

And you are wrong, you can't edit all gob files. Some of them maybe works, but most of them not. Change just one char in file and it wil stuck or crash.

The question is, what are those 3? One is the intro's last sentence and the others?

Whole intro works fine for me  One is "Roadside Outhouse" as hint on map (works fine everywhere else), second is one item description "Stun all nearby enemies for % seconds" and third cant remember what it was. There is nothing more left untranslated.

The "Or... So he was told" sentence in the intro is one of them.

In ToV there are one more at least:
- "Still a true story" at the intro.
- The infamous "Stun all nearby enemies for $1 seconds."
- And "Storage Chest", weird 'cos it can be translated in original DeathSpank.

Hello Raptor.

I think the actual maps are on file "GameData-000000000".
I tried to rename but not work. You could create a TOOL from the files?

Thanks

There is no need to localize any tin file from GameData-000000000.gg. As I wrote before, it is tool made only for maps overlays with location names. I have no full tin files structure, so I can't made full editor for tin archives.

Your tool work in TOV.

If it does, just add the file name Map-WWII_Intro_Text-English.tin in you tool.

Is possible?

Remains only this file

Oh, in that case, thanks 

BTW I have problems with the DDS files, as I can't edit them as I extract them. How should I edit those (before you ask, I used Photoshop to edit some DDS files for other games, but these just won't work)?

Oh I'm sorry, I didn't mention which one has errors.

Well I am translating all the games to Hungarian language, and I've finished translating DeathSpank and Thongs of Virtue, and now comes The Baconing. I only tried with DeathSpank's files, but all of those didn't work, no matter what I did. I haven't tried Thongs of Virtue's files, as I want to finish with DeathSpank first.

Well, file GameData-000000300.gg is ok and I'm able to process it. But is there any how how to send me whole file gamedata-00000000.gg? There is something wrong in part you sent me. There are wrong data in header and I want to be sure that it is not just fault of cutter program  And yes, I know it is big file, but you can use any filesharing (MediaFire, Rapidshare, ...)

Well I don't know what to say, seems that GameData-000000000.gg is damaged somehow. 1st file you sent me (5MB cut) was really differenet then 1st 5MB from this whole file. So you sent me 2 different files. Are you sure that this one is not damaged from your side? I really done thave PS3 version of game, so I can't check it.

Ok, I found info there are NOT fully decrypted data for PS3 version of Deathspank. So that's seems to be main problem. If achive is not decrypted, extractor can't work because of invalid data.

I repacked the file gamedata - 000010000.gg adding Russian text from the PC version of the game.
Game starting normally, but naturally there is no text fonts, because i can't repacked big file.
And strange thing. MP3 from gamedata - 000010000.gg after unpacking in HEX looks like a set of random data, but it opens perfectly any mediaplayer. Why is it so can be?

Preserve extracted directories and files structure. To import just select root folder, where files were extracted.

Xraptor you tools are wonderful! I'm translating the first game with a team of 2 friends, but we have a little problem editing the .xml files. If i edit them with notepad++, when i type "òàùèéì" and i save, opening again the files i find "oauei". If i rename the files from .xml to .txt and i edit them, when i rename them back to .xml, i find some garbage like Ă Ă˛ĂąĂ¨Ă¬Ă˛ĂąĂ Ă˛Ă©!
If i edit directly with your tool the .textdict files, i have no problem inserting the accented characters. There is a way to do the same thing with the .xml file and import back? I'm asking only because editing the .xml i can make good use of some functions like "jump to" or "search".

XML is only text file. Simply save it as utf-8 encoding and all will be ok. If you will save it in different code page, you have to edit encoding in header. Default is encoding="UTF-8". But I think that problem is in Notepad++. Maybe you have disabled automatic codepage detection

Thank you it's working! My only last doubt is: i must to edit them enabling "Utf8" or "utf8 without BOM (Byte order mark)"?

It should work in both cases, but it's recommended to use utf-8 with bom. When there is no bom, you can never know if it is utf-8 or not. 
But you can still open this xml in excel (or other comfortable xml editor), edit all string and then save it cack from excel to xml. Encoding will be saved ok because of excel processing. There is no need to edit xml in any text editor. It is yor choice.
