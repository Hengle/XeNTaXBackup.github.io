- Post Title: Max Payne 3 and Sleeping Dogs

These games have been out for a while, has anyone had any progress with extracting materials and models from the two games?

I mainly just wanna put Wei in certain clothes, and maybe some hot dancers on the yacht, Fabianna, and maybe Giovanna, that's all. Gonna make an animated film =D

For max payne 3, i did some research on the .rcf files I got open iv 1.8.2, and I'm not sure which .rcf to open will get me to the models for max payne 3, i end up inside the .rcf and get .wtd anyone know? say if i wanted to extract max?
