- Post Title: Pingus Unused Modes?

I was hacking around with the latest version of Pingus when I found 7 unused/beta modes.
Here is a description of those 7 modes and what they do.
Angel: Turns the selected Pingu into an angel which floats up and away, results in loss of that Pingu.
Boarder: Makes the selected Pingu ride a skateboard, results in the game crashing.
Faller: Under some circumstances it will make the selected Pingu fall, useful for stopping Angel Pingus or Superman Pingus.
Rocket Launcher: Makes the selected Pingu fire a Rocket Launcher that doesn't do much, probably in beta mode.
Superman: Turns the selected Pingu into Superman who flys away, results in loss of that Pingu.
Waiter: Makes the selected Pingu stand in place and wait impatiently, doesn't do much.
Walker: Makes the selected Pingu stop whatever they're doing and walk, only has an effect on Angels, Bashers, Bombers, Bridgers, Climbers, Diggers, Miners, Rocket Launchers, Sliders, Supermen, and Waiters.

Here is how to hack these unused modes into your levels:

  1. Make a Pingus level.
  2. Save it.
  3. Open it with your preferred text editor.
  4. Find where it says "    (actions"
  5. After "    (actions" on a new line paste the following

```
      (boarder 20)
      (faller 20)
      (rocketlauncher 20)
      (superman 20)
      (waiter 20)
      (walker 20)
```

  6. Save the level.
  7. Play the level and admire your work.
