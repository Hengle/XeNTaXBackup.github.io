We don't automatically know what game you're talking about.

They contain typically .ogg vorbis (open source mp3 alternative) or ubisoft's own adpcm (use the tool decubisnd made by zench for that), normally both at times. splinter cell is based off a modified UE2 engine, but the .uax (UE2 format) files are merely redirects to the actual audio files in the spk/cpk/pk etc. if you understand how the redirection is done, you could spoof it to your own files possibly.  Though I'd recommend against talking about repacks of games in this forum, simply because talks of piracy or links etc, are not allowed.

DecUbiSndGui just extract the files to WAV and OGG and LAYER,, but not know how repackage files again....

what's the right way to use??

I highly discourage recompressing lossy audio. You can shrink file sizes, but at the expense of audio quality. Audio in games are usually pretty bad as it is. You don't want them to get worse.

well I don't know it very well myself, but I know the LEAD engine ubisoft uses still has the .uax files but they don't hold audio. only links to the .pk/.spk/.cpk .  This means if you knew the format and how it links you could possibly link to your own files by editing the .uax . I don't know how to specifically do this myself.

As long as you are recompressing lossy audio to get a smaller file size, you'll get lower quality. That's something you can't avoid.
