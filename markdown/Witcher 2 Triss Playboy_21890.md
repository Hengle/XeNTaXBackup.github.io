- Post Title: Witcher 2 Triss Playboy

Does anyone know of/remember a set of xnalara models of Triss Merigold that recreated her polish Playboy look?  They were made by XNAaraL, but he/she has removed their DeviantArt account and the models aren't available anywhere else - not even images of them.  I'd like to track them down if possible.
