- Post Title: A new Beginning - QUICKBMS - not working reimport

Hello to All.

I want to translate A new beginning game. I use QuickBMS with visionaire 0.2.1 script. Decompressing of DATA.VIS goes fine, but when i want to reimport changed files back to vis. archive, then everything goes OK, but when i try to run it with game, ther game has error. When i try to decompress new vis file again, then it stops export on new imported changed file with this error:

Error: the compressed zlib/deflate input is wrong or incomplete <-5>

Error: there is an error with the decompression
          the returned output size is negative <-1>


Where is the problem ? I think, reimport not working fine.

Thank you

Filip
