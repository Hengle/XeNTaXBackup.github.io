Yes, and I figured out the 
Sacrifice *.WAD format, 

so expect that some time later in there too!    
Meanwhile, I'm thinking of starting a section here on XeNTaX.com where I present all the different formats in detail. Stay tuned for that. It's an Open World in an Open Source Community!

Did some major refactoring of the ListCtrl, making it its own derived class (I used a built-in one, but that was too limited). After doing that, I was able to add sorting and icons. Still some work to do on that, but I've got a pretty cool screenshot for whoever's interested (notice the list is sorted by size).



I'm continually amazed at how easy it is to do this sort of stuff, using Python and wxWindows. Both are really excellent pieces of work and I highly recommend using them.

It really does look rather nifty, I fully agree!
