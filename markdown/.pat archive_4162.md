This is a patch file! As I know you can't edit, and this program is not open sourced. Made by this: [http://www.tibed.net/vpatch/](http://www.tibed.net/vpatch/) 
But if you want to do something with this, try to ask the author.

By the way: the game translated with hex editor. Usable editor not exist.
We made our translation (hun) also in hex way. (Also working with vpatch files)
