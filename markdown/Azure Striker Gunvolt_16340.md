I am currently working on this game's fan translation for Nintendo 3DS. I compared the JPN version game to the USA version game and I believe text are stored in those .irarc files. I tried to use [Aluigi's script](http://aluigi.altervista.org/bms/azure_striker_gunvolt.bms) to extract the .irarc files but it only returns a branch of .vap files and .dat files. I have no idea how to find those text. Would someone like to have a look in these files?

Apologies for my English.

.irarc samples can be found [here](https://mega.nz/#F!O1ZCnbiY!cguXuq4sVvChV3jRnlWrvw).

Thank you.

Aluigi's script isn't the issue. Could you upload *.vap + *.dat samples?

Since I am at school and I can't access my workplace, I can only upload samples on Sunday( Apologies ). But I uploaded the .irarc files on Mega, and you can download these files from the topic. I got those .vap files and .dat by extracting that .irarc files with Aluigi's script. You can get .vap + .dat samples by doing the same thing.

Again, apologies for my English.

Thank you.
