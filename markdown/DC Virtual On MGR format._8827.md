I'm sorry, 	
I have a question about the forum rules.
Is that a against regulations on this code?

```
2F 3F 71 79 78 36 63 62 33 76 6B 72 69 30 32 34 78
```

I made a correction to the code.

Nah, just leave it and see what Mouse says. It didn't even have a domain name, it was just a question mark and a slash, I had to guess the rest . Ha ha ha I know where you got the idea from though   .

Yeah, if they say no, then remove it. Or better yet, just remove it and PM him or Dinoguy and ask about your little clever technique . Otherwise, regarding this format, all I can say is I looked at it right now and can tell you it doesn't look good. It's somewhat of a similar format to the previous virtual on game, the one that I gave up on and the one that finale00 could only find some point data. There is a lot of repetitive data in the model files and nothing close to seeing anything that looks like an index buffer.

I don't remember the format anymore but it was probably just like those PS2 games where you just string a bunch of vertices together or something like tri-strips except it sounds like it takes up more space than just using 2-byte indices.

Anyways I also only use mediafire, so if anyone sees a string of random ascii then it may be a mediafire link lol
Oops there goes the secret.
