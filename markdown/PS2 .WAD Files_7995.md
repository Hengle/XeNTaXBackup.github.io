- Post Title: PS2 .WAD Files

I have a Xiaolin Showdown for PS2, and I'm trying to rip some models from the files. Most of the game disc consists of .WAD files, which I believe are archives... But I'm not sure how to extract anything from them.

Most WAD extractors I've found are either for a different type of WAD file, or want some sort of twin file, like *.WAD and a *.HED... It's just the WAD files on the disc.

I tried Game Extractor; it managed to read the file somewhat... It picked up there were files inside, but it couldn't read what the files were.

If someone could maybe point me in the right direction...?
