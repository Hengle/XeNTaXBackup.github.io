- Post Title: Hyperdimension Neptunia U .wwb sound files (SOLVED)

Around 2 weeks earlier, I downloaded Neptunia U when it was on sale on Steam. I looked through the sound files with a file format that I think is similar to .xwb. Is there a way to extract this type of file?
EDIT: Turns out the .wwb file was the same as an .xwb file, and the .wsb had 16 extra bytes before the header compared to .xsb (Thanks Liandril).

Opened up the .wsb file with HxD, and it looks like the .wwb could work the same way as extracting a .xwb file with the .xsb filenames.

Hi sammyrms1,

the .wwb looks like a normal .xwb, but for some reason (maybe because it's an unsupported version) [xactxtract](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=17&t=4391&p=43840&hilit=saint+row#p43840) cannot extract the files. Maybe unxwb can.

The .wsb is a modified .xsb. They put 16 additional bytes before the soundbank header ("SDBK"), so
delete the first 16 Byte of the .wsb with a hex editor
rename it to n00en.xsb
use xactxtract in order to correct the checksum:

```
xactxtract.exe -c n00en.xsb
```

Afterwards, you get the file info using

```

Please note that the cue names in the .xsb are not the file names of the .xwb files. But in your case, every cue is assigned to exactly one file, so you can use the list provided by xactxtract together with an appropriate renaming tool in order to name the extracted files according to the cue names.

Tried this for Diablo 4 wsb files, but not success
