Hey, so I've extracted the main BNK music file and gotten 951 WEM files to sift through. The vast majority of which are only 8kb. Anyway, I tried running them all through ww2ogg but got: 

```
Parse Error: RIFF truncated
```
 for each file.

I've opened a few files up in a Hex Editor and the headers say: 
```
RIFF¬!..WAVEfmt ........€»..h<..l...........
```


So then I tried ToWav but I didn't have any luck. I probably did something wrong though... do you just drag and drop files onto ToWav.exe?

Any help? Should I upload a few samples? Also, sorry if this is stupid sounding but I'm learning as I go.

All the files are actually in the big 2gb PCK file.

Well that solves that. For anyone interested I used Ravioli Extractor ([http://www.scampers.org/steve/sms/other.htm](http://www.scampers.org/steve/sms/other.htm)), pointed it at the 2.77gb "streamed_sfx.pck" file, and set it to convert sounds to Wave.

The resulting files are all playable in VLC, so I guess its time to run through them and get the ones I want.

Thank you OrangeC, I couldn't see the wood for trees as the saying goes.

BTW there is a soundbank.xml file with the names in them. if anyone knows of a script to auto rename the songs based off that script. then be much appreciated.

.BNK archives contains ADPCM files.

To decode them, need to use latest ima_rejigger
For mass convertion:

```
for /r %%i In (*.wem) do "%CD%/ima_rejigger5.exe" %%i %%i.wav
```

Apologies for bumping this but I've been wondering about something regarding the game's audio.
As you know, the game's combat music is split into segments that are played in a random order. However, each of those segments has a "fade-in" part and sometimes a "fade-out". Does anyone know if there's information about offsets for the main part of each segment anywhere in the game's data so fade-in and fade-out can be properly cut?
