.FPD is pseudo-archive(extractor 2.5 can extract dds and mp3 files). Many part of resourses is specific data.

The thing you're looking for is called either Nova Software Extractor 2.5 or NovaSoft Extractor 2.5; I hope that helps.
Anyway that tool is ANCIENT thus not too good, if you just want to scan an archive & dump some MP3s to an HDD you'd better use way newer programs like that Ravioli Extractor or something.

Later!
