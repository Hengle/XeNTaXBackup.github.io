- Post Title: Models extraction from SEGA AS Racing X360 .Zig BANJOKAZOOIE

Hey guys! so I've been looking into the meshes from sonic and Sega all-stars Racing with Banjo Kazooie for the Xbox 360 lately and I've not been able to find much on the format that i'm pretty sure contains the models and textures... the file names are .zig and .zif formats, i found several mentions of it online however all of the programs that were at some point associated with it are either long since incompatible with newer builds of windows or disappeared off the internet completely. On top of that i'm pretty sure these are proprietary formats from SUMO Digital (the company that made the game) if anybody could shoot some insight my way that would be great! 
Here's all the character files (70mbs): [https://mega.nz/#!wz4hwQBb!t-iJB60b1rE8 ... 1N1JiMvGVo](https://mega.nz/#!wz4hwQBb!t-iJB60b1rE8aicuyQsOokNhSfb8w1bfk1N1JiMvGVo)
Some of the characters in the files that might be interesting are
Banjo & Kazooie from of course Banjo Kazooie
A Mii from the Wii
An Avatar from XBox LIVE
The guy from House of The Dead
plenty of Sonic characters and tons of SEGA characters too lol

So if anybody could help that would be amazing!
