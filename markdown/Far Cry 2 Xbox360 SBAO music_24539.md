I wanted to try to rip the Xbox360 FC2 version. It seems like I was able to extract the sound archive with Dunia FC2 Gibbed Tools. After this I again end up with SBAO files like on all other platforms. Now the PC version uses OGG and PS3 MP3 but weirdly enough nothing I throw at the files is able to playback them. I suspected that its most likely XMA but renaming it doesnt do anything. Even renaming them to .raw does nothing. Dunno what to try anymore.

Anybody got a idea or could take a look at the SBAO FC2 Xbox360 file? I am kinda intrigued since the filesize of the audio is almost twice from PC and PS3. Might be higher quality.

Here are some of the tracks:

Thanks in advance.
