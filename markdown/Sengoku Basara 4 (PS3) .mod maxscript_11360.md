Great job man. Thank you. Everything is working fine, it partially works for SB3 models, armature is loaded and shows an error, but that was expected to have changes between 3 and 4

Hi! If you send me some samples from SB3, I'm sure I can edit script to import models from SB3

Thank you very much for the script =) I tested a few models and most of them work fine, however the rigged face of pl039 does not load.
arc file is pl039_00_ev_face

Is there any way to fix it?

Hi! Thanks for bug report. I'll try to fix this, though this model has index buffer which differs from others.

Not aborted, just I can't figure out how to import this index buffer correctly, that's the only issue for now.

Hi zaramot , sorry for necroposting but I really would like to know how you got .mod files out from .arc container .

Thanks in advance, Drawing.
