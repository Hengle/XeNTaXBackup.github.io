Hey Guys,

I want to find out how I can check from where a program is downloading its updates.
at the moment I want to download some of the files manually one.
Is there a way to find out from where the Program gets the files?

There is a program called URLSnooper.
It show all the address while you accessing.

Maybe that's what you after!?

I use wireshark for anything related to network-related things.

Microsoft Network Monitor is a lot nicer to look at than Wireshark, IMO. However, my go-to technique is to use Privoxy with URL logging enabled. That way you don't have to wait for some large program to start, and you get global (for programs that use IE proxy settings) ad blocking as well. If the program won't connect to the proxy, then you can use one of the other programs.
