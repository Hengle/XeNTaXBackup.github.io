Only way to do this would be to hook into the graphics renderer and monitor each time it renders a polygon. This wouldn't allow you to get models in their default pose because the models will be animating. There are also other hard things to go around like FOV and special effects so this isn't really a fully-obtainable goal.

i hate  to throw things inside the bin  , but "3d model steal software" oddly sounds a bit wrong. 

anyway, have you tried looking at 3d ripper dx? it's most likely the same program you're aiming to do . but unfortunately, their website has shut down. well google is your friend 

goodluck on that, cheers!

firsak you linked to Game Assassin. Have you actually ever been successful in using that tool? As far as I know no english speaking person has been able to figure it out.

it works but its pointless without the  full version because the demo version is very limited.

GA works great, the new versions are buggy.. but free.. the only features you unlock when buying the full version is bone animation capture. maybe some advanced capturing settings for openGL. but otherwise there is an english option setting. to operate it, goto options, english, then goto the check mark to capture, then load, to load a exe.. the capture key is Alt+F7

The program costs 60 dollars USD, the author knows english so email him if your interested

..wait why isn't this topic locked, the guy is obviously trolling for models

It depends on how you will design you program, example, 3d ripper dx, it hooks on the game's exe to access its video renderer, specifically DirectX9/8 then, captures data from the render data, decodes it then recodes it back as a readable data, to be exported for your program. mainly all known programs that firsak linked functions just like that. except for 3dvia prinstcreen. 

the downside of this method, is you have no bone data for rig and animation, you'll only get meshes and textures.

goodluck

3D model rippers use the "man in the middle" hacking technique to read the 3D models.

in the case of a PC, most games use DirectX or OpenGL to render graphics. What these programs do is to fully replace the DirectX driver with a custom one, that ends calling the native driver, but also logs the render calls to a file, which is later interpreted.

The bad news for you is that you're not going to find what you want, I mean: a solution that can be explained in detail in just two lines. You need to have Guru level knowledge of the driver from which you want to get the models.

I don't know about the PSP, but I think in most consoles, including PSP, there's no "graphics driver", the game communicates directly with the hardware, so the "man in the middle" attack is simply not possible.  In that case, you're out of luck, and the only way to get the models is the old way, by reverse engineering the file format.

Another option for PSP would be to develop a full blown emulator (which is also a huge task), but, from my knowledge, PSP hardware is very close to the one of the PS2, and the PS2 sends the 3D models already projected to the graphics pipeline, so you would capture the 3D models with a lot of distortion.

If you have understood half of what I've said, you'll understand how difficult is what you're trying to do.... so, don't ask again "but how I do it"

There is one already. It's named ["Lamb"](http://drakon.ixan.net/)
It even has a source-code, but it can't rip textures properly.(In other words, it can't rip textures at all. Author is working on it)
So, maybe better to help a author "instead of inventing bicycle" ?
