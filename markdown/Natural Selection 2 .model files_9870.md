- Post Title: Natural Selection 2 .model files

Hello there,

Has anyone tried to play around with the .model and/or .animation_graph files from the recently released game Natural Selection 2 from Unknown World Entertainment?

I'd love to get my hands on those models to be able to use them in 3D Studio Max, but the Developer's hold back with releasing any raw assets until they think, that they have done enough work on the game (performance etc) and development tools (stability) to throw the rest towards the community.

I could link to the actual Test Engine Build, which anyone can download. Only executing the Tools and Test Client requires a key, but the stuff is from 2010 and the models have changed since then. If there's another method on how I can supply someone, who is interested, with a .model and .animation_graph file, give me a message and I'll see what I can do.

Greetings,

Maxunit

The game runs on DirectX9 so it shouldn't be too difficult to find a ripping program to extract the models you want. I've thought about buying it for this reason, but since there are just a couple models I'm interested in I think I will wait until the price drops a bit.

The thing is, that 3D Ripper DX and other ripping applications rip the model in its current state and animation (this specific frame) and it won't be rigged nor in the t-pose. A derpload of work to get this "fixed".

The problems with 3D Ripper X where it captures models in their rendered form rather than t-posed form aren't present with Game Assassin or Ninja Ripper/DX Ripper. I've had some good success using these applications for acquiring models in the past from games like Dark Sektor, Inversion, and Splinter Cell: Conviction. Definitely check these programs out because they will completely change the way you think about ripping programs.

3D Ripper DX essentially is a no-go for me, since it has not been updated in ages. GameAssassin...rips stuff, but outdated plugins (3DS Max 2011 -.-) and you need to pay for the app to have all features and I have no idea, how much. Ninja Ripper..never heard about it before, but this one can only rip textures from Natural Selection 2, sadly  .

ninja ripper should work if you do it right, I only got textures from bf3 with ninjaripper until I changed methods. first off, dont use the default capture key, change it. second, try intruder or dx9 dll methods, both.
