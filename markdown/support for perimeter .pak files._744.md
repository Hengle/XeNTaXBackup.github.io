Your request is noted. Work is piling up, so don't expect stuff soon. The new version of the program has priority, after which new formats will be examined.

That's even BETTER!  But are you sure about all of these? I remember looking at Master of Orion 3 and I beleive it was not a zip file. Where did you get this list?

I have a different script for FarCry PAK files, though. And it's not ZIP.

FarCry does have some ZIP-based archives, but not all of them. FarCry also has their own archive format. So I can confirm that entry in his list.
