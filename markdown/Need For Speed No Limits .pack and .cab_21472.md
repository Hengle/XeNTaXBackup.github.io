Hi! I check files from new version of No Limits and I saw new format. Anybody can decompressing this format? We need models from this game!

I check this, but I don't think so that all files was extracted. Many cars missing just like Polestar 1.

Well, just tested all pack files with their external cab blocks in your sample and every file has reached at least 99% of coverage. So either you didn't get all the packages downloaded or the file you're looking for is no longer with that name or whatever.

Some files can't be extract.

Coz you didn't get the required cab file while the pack file needs reference to it.
