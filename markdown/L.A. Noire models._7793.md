- Post Title: L.A. Noire models.

What I would be interested in is how Tosyk ripped Phelps. I tried with 3D Ripper DX, but the game stays on the synchronising screen when it is injected. So, Tosyk, could you tell us how you ripped the model and textures and made them able to be converted to GTA SA? Because I would really love to convert some cars, to San Andreas and to GTA IV. I love the cars of L.A. Noire and I also know many people from the GTA scene who also would love driving with them in one of the GTAs. Thanks!

Falo also did some work with the models, but so far he only converted the flamethrower. Model format ain't that complicated if you ask Tosyk.

Alright, great! Wrote Tosyk a PM yesterday, he did not respond yet. Can't wait to get the models out, those are really beautiful cars.

Tosyk use a program like 3D Ripper or sikmilar. I think it still has not managed to extract models

I don't think so. Tried 3D Ripper on the game at one time and it only ended up stuck on the title screen.

There are several similar programs how [this](http://blackninja2000.narod.ru/rus/directx_ripper.html) or [this](http://www.3dvia.com/products/3dvia-printscreen/l) but do not know if it works or serve.

Nope, both don't work. To be honest, I don't care how I get the models out of L.A. Noire and into my program, I also consider ripping as the first step. That's why I asked Tosyk, he somehow made it and I really wanna know how!

Alright, I see, thanks!. Now, is there any possibility to get GameAssasin in English? I don't understand the asian language it is written in and I just don't know which button to press
