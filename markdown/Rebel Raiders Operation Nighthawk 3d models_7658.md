- Post Title: Rebel Raiders Operation Nighthawk 3d models

Hello guys. My name is Maximiliano. I`m having problems trying to extract the 3d model from this game.....I`ve scanned the bag file with Game Extractor and shows ogg, wav, png and bmp files, but doesn`t show the 3d models. Am I doing something wrong?? I`ve scanned all the files in the instalation folder and the only big enought to contain the models in game is the bag file. Besides is the only one containing files. Any ideas?? Thanks.
