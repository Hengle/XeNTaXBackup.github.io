- Post Title: list of common  3d format structures

is there already or could possibly one be created.

A list that shows basic structure of most common 3d formats - wiki etc  has them if u go and search around, but its often buried under lots of text and not that clean  structures.

What i mean is more like 
header ( what ever it has)
blocks of:
vertex  
float x
float y
float z
float w

normal
float x
float y
float z
float w

.. uv, etc comes after.


So when u actually end up wit ha new 3d format to reverse - you can look for similarities. Even custom formats are often based off the existing ones and with some extra data added here and there - and perhaps in a binary instead of ascii.
