Hey all, this is another game that uses the Unreal engine, actually a rather old one. I've heard multiple times that different games using the Unreal engine usually use their own, slightly different formats, so I figured I'd point this out. Unfortunately, I have the game installed on another comp, so I can't upload any files for you right now.  But I will (try to) remember!

Hey,

Yes, the unreal-based games do use different formats (slightly) for each of the games, with the exclusion of some of the really early games. I'm not sure how old this game is - but hopefully it is old enough to not have any changes 

Anyway, if/when you do get a chance, upload some of the files here and I will take a look at them and let you know what needs to be done. Thanks mate.

Well, the CD says it's copyright 1999...

There are a number of downloadable maps, and some textures and sounds too, I just need to find the URL. Hang on...

EDIT: Ahh, here it is... [http://www.nerfarenablast.net/](http://www.nerfarenablast.net/)

Just use the links to the side. I think sounds are located under 'other'...

Hi again,

Thanks for that - I had a quick look at the website, and will download some of those files soon. Hopefully I will be able to look at them within the week - I just can't really give a definitive timeframe because I am really busy atm.

Okay. I remember seeing that some of the maps were actually for a different game, can't remember what it was called though... seems like it was Unreal Tournament or something...
