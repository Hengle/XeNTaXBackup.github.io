- Post Title: Ninja ripper question

Hello there,

first, sorry, but i didn't know where to post this topic since this is my first post.
I just have one question about ninja ripper importer, not program itself.

Does somebody knows how to import correctly NORMALS from model with ninja ripper importer, because they are messed up?

Thanks.
