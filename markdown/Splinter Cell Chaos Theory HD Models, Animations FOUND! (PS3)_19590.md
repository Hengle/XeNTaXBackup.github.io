- Post Title: Splinter Cell Chaos Theory HD Models, Animations FOUND! (PS3)

Hey everyone! Just wanted to ask for help on files I've ripped from the HD PS3 version of Chaos Theory. It apparently has it's resources a lot more manageable and easy to rip than its PC counterpart. There is no need for decompressing/decompiling maps, everything is seperated in its suggested folder hierarchy.

Hi Pepsee, did you find any solution to getting those models and animations? So sad that I found none. SCCT and Double Agent are so good, can't believe their models and especially the animations can't be accessed. I just hope someday Ubisoft relaunch SCCT as a remaster with all the old but gold models, slow-paced anims and with that this subject becomes discussed again more actively.
Can anyone help?
