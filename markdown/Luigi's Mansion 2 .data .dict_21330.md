- Post Title: Luigi's Mansion 2 .data .dict

Someone can help me on Luigi's Mansion 2? I found a source for this this tool "LM2L GUI" created by CHEMI6DER/TheFearsomeDzeraora to unpack .data and .dict (text file contents) and have a new folder containing files: file000, file001, file002, file003, file004, file005,file006, file007. Until here, ok!

But the I have to unpack "file003" this file have the real text from the game. I test it on "Hex Workshop"

But I can't extract it. Always I try, I have a error, like on this pictures
