- Post Title: Dreamcast DSP Files

Hi, Anyone know how to i convert MLT files to miniDSF Correctly? 

When ever i use King's DSF Tools (DSFMake) i just Bleep-bloop versions of the Songs likes the Instruments are Missing (Or it just do nothing)

Do i need a Curtain Version of Python installed for it to work?

But that is only when i have to build a MLT i must be doing something wrong

The game I'm pulling from is ILLBLEED, the SAMPLE.MLT (This Converts to MiniDFS Fine) has OSB in it of the Sounds Effects in it according to the raw imports to Audacity the voices are in there own V_0*.OSB Files in the root/AMAZON Dir

I'll Link Samples if anyone wants to help
