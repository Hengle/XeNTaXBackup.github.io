- Post Title: Guildwars Models

Hello all, 

I am new to the forum and have decided to post here after reading a thread about the gw.dat file research, i realize that thread is dead 
(heres a link [viewtopic.php?f=10&t=1645](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=1645)) 

but id like to know if they got anywhere with the model extracts? I'm currently learning how to use maya and 3d max in an attempt to make a decent Recruitment vid for gw2's release i believe that those models would go along way to save me time.

I was working on it, but the format was way too crazy for me at the time and it didn't help that all the files were numbers so I had no clue what everything was or how to link them.
