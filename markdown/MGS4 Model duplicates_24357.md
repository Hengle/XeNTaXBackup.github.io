- Post Title: MGS4 Model duplicates

Does anyone have an idea as to why there's so many duplicates of models in MGS4? I decompiled all the stage.dat files and I've found atleast 9 duplicates of Snake's stun knife, and the same insurgent models, just wondering if anyone actually knew as to why there's duplicates

Because they preferred speed over space. Each stage has all the models that will be used in its stage regardless of if the same models are used elsewhere as the game doesn't have to seek all over the disk to find things this way. Also this didn't require its own topic in the 3D models section you should have just added it to one of the existing mgs4 threads.
