Hello everyone,

I'm quite new here and I was wondering were do I start?
I basicly want to get the models from Metal gear rising but I got no clue on how to get them.
Ofcource will I share the models once I have them ^^

at this point I'm actually willing to pay for the model database if anyone can get it for me ?
OBJ if possible.
I kindof need them in a weeks time!
And because I dont want to be a leech I'm willing to pay for your help!

Just wait until the tools are released and then you'll have your models for free.

either you hack the game yourself, which is unlikely being your new to this. or you wait until someone else with the required skill set takes interest and releases free tools

a wait could be a couple of days.. maybe a couple of weeks.. or maybe never 

Thats why its important to grow support and interest in the format you want cracked.

Thanks for the feedback Mariokart64n,

That's why I wanted to give out a small donation to whoever hacked it and could give me the models.
Seeing I dont even know what tools/plugins and etc I would need I thought it would be better to support whoever got there first like a contest haha
