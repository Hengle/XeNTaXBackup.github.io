I think this is not the right place to post your stupid spam. I'm sure now that spammers are the most retarded "people" in the internets. But yeah, they have enough brains to use bots to post spam.
Rrrrawr. I can't just pass-by when i see something stupid like this. I request raid against spammers (just kidding).

Well, I back you completely. I think all such spammers should be shot dead.   No trial needed. Instant execution.
