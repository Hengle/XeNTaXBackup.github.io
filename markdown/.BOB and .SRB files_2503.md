- Post Title: .BOB and .SRB files

From what I have been able to find, the .BOB files are Amiga Blitter Objects and the .SRB are related to them somehow.

Does anyone have any info on this format?

thanks! ^^

There are two kinds of BOB types.

There are Blitter Objects. But there is also Bob Raytracer files.

Could you possibly submit examples of these files?

These files are from the Tricky Quiky Games 2 game, released in 1995.

I'm trying to rewrite the engine, so some help would be cool.

Tricky Quiky 2 is one of my favourite games of all times. The files you posted are really very interesting!   I hope you manage to reverse engineer the engine!

The .SRB files might be Corel WordPerfect files (Clipart Scrapbooks), but I'm really not so sure about that, because they begin with a link to the .BOB files with is quite suspicious. Maybe they're just somehow describing the movement of the Blitter Objects (see below) in a non-standard way.

The .BOB files (Blitter Objects, [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blitter_object](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blitter_object)) most probably could be read by a program called Debabelizer, which unfortunately seems to be available only for MacOS.
The file format might be described in this book: [http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0672323699](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0672323699)
There's a short excerpt on books.google: [http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0 ... NwkSYp23rs](http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0672323699&id=lRUj-nhQRu8C&pg=PT0&lpg=PT0&ots=7uG94zP42B&dq=0-672-32369-9&hl=de&sig=z9rwguAkahnyxdYdXNwkSYp23rs)

EDIT: Actually, I just checked the contents of that book, and it doesn't contain anything helpful in this case.   

Please keep me posted about your research!

Thanks for your interest, I've been trying to learn Assembly to see if I can get any hints debugging the executable.

EDIT: Another interesting thing is that the setup creates an archive called NESTLE.DAT (I have been able to extract it already), using 3 files (extracted from the first archive, NESQUIK.SET, just a regular ZIP file): QUICKY.PRE (game archive), APPEND.LST and SRB.LST (both plain text files listing some files).

If we extract the QUIKY.PRE, it has both .BOB and .SRB files, but during setup, it creates NESTLE.DAT, which only contains .BOB files, different from the ones from QUICKY.PRE. Maybe they are merged somehow with the information from the .LST files.

UPDATE: [http://triton.com.pt/nesquik](http://triton.com.pt/nesquik)

All reverse engineering work done by me and Praetorian. Still some bugs to fix, but we have figured out almost every bit of the game engine and file formats.
