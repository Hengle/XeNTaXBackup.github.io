you used some cryptic version of zip that even winrar can't unpack. could you upload a new pack?

You'll need to read the "Extraction" section and download Aluigi's QuickBMS and the zip.bms script in order to extract the archive.

The good news is I've been able to figure out most of the .carbin layout since my last posting, with exception to everything before encountering the first car section.  I wrote a small program in c# to parse through everything which I'll probably be posting in another day or two.

Right now, I'm just having a hard time finding a reliable way to calculate the first section offset.  Here is a generic outline on how the .carbin file contents are layed out.  I'll be posting more detailed information on the individual structures once I've had a bit more time to research them.

```
UnknownDataList (most likely array of shorts)
Section1
   Name
   Header (size depends on value of first dword: 0 = 88 bytes, 2 = 12 bytes)
   Piece1
     Header (76 bytes)
     Name
     Indices (list of triangle strips separated by 0xFFFFFF)
   Padding (16 bytes)
   Piece2
     Header
     Name
     Indices
   Padding
   Piece3
     Header
     Name
     Indices
   Padding
   Piece...
   Vertices
Section2
   Name
   Header
   Piece1
     Header
     Name
     Indices
   Padding
   Piece2
     Header
     Name
     Indices
   Padding
   Piece...
   Vertices
Section3
...

```


Also, attached is an archive of a few car part's vertex data.  Each vertex is 40 bytes in length and I have no idea how they are encoded at the moment so feel free to throw me some tips or suggestions

sounds good although it would probably be better if you actually rezipped the pack for everybody 

have you ruled out that the first 3x4bytes are xyz 32bit floats? and since the xbox360 gpu is an ATI and the powerpc can switch endian it might just be straight intel 32bit float? or an intel float stored in 4 bytes in reverse order.

the first byte of 4 seems to always have the msb to 0 which might indicate a sign bit

we might speculate that the coordinates are kept between -6 and 6 with a meter as a unit and the model arranged near 0,0,0. what I would do. maybe 0,0,0 at the mass center projected down to the ground. so maybe x +-1.25, y +-3, z 0-2.5

would be really cool to have the models

Yes, I've obviously analyzed it enough to determine that they aren't using the standard floating point format.  I've scanned for singles and doubles in either endian format on every byte boundary.  It is probably fair to assume the first values are xyz coordinates, but I'm not sure if they are 4-byte values or 2-byte values yet.  I did some quick tests converting 16-bit integers to floats by assuming they are clamped between -1 and 1, and then 0 and 1, but I guess it could be just as true they use 32-bit ints instead to provide more precision.  That would honestly make the most sense so I'll run some tests and see what happens

do you know any 3d hardware that uses anything other than 32bit float for geometry? 16bit seems extremely unlikely to me as it's very low precision and require translation that would slow it down. 64bit is whopper overkill and couldn't be benefitted from by any graphics hardware anyway.
32bit integer would be greater precision for bounded geometry than 32bit float but again it would be useless since the hardware would run 32bit float anyway..

I think it must be a good premise to assume they are 32bit floats.

maybe try hunting for the mantissa first. only so many places the MSB of the mantissa can be and only two endians for the 4 bytes.
load as integer, mask the bits and convert to float and display or export it to see if there is any geometry resemblence. even without the exponent I'd guess there will be continuous surfaces

the implied 1 msb of the mantissa shouldn't matter too much for this

It's actually quite common for programs to pack floats into 16-bit integers.  When relative to a bounding box, they can be just as precise.  The extra processing power is also pretty negligible compared to the amount of time saved from cutting disk access in half.  Now this might not be the case here, since these files are compressed anyways, but there would still probably be some space saved regardless...

The thing that throws me off the idea of data being packed to save space is that each vertex is already 40 bytes in length, and I can't imagine them containing much more information than that.  Since the data is not in any standard floating point format though, this leads me to believe that the data is instead possibly packed for extra precision?  It seems like I will have to go your route and pick apart the bits and assume this being a nonstandard 32-bit floating point format.  Looks like one sign bit, anywhere from 0-5 bits for an exponent, and the rest as the significand.  Guess I'll be experimenting with all the possible combinations and hopefully something shows up in my render window eventually

try big endian first, msb is sign, then exponent 6-9bits, then mantissa.
load as big endian integer, shift up 9 bits, divide by 1000000000.0f

shift up from 1-10 in both big and small endian. if it isn't in any of those I think they have intentionally shuffled the bits to make it harder to read. that could be varying degrees of gruesome but let's see if it isn't there in plain text.

Been busy lately, so I haven't been able to work on this as much as I'd like, but I know enough to fully parse through lod0 and cockpit .carbin files so here's a little stubbed out application written in c# where you can experiment with decoding vertices or other information...

looks good but I'm pretty busy on many other projects, like saving the world in all kinds of ways and some programming projects so I don't really need to be spread out more than already. so the task is really yours and you are already well into it. just a little further. will be a great scoop. keep on trucking.
I really do think you can assume 32bit float. and if it doesn't make sense, maybe consider they could have rearranged the bits to make the format harder to read.

Once you do a 4 byte endian swap over the entire vertex buffer, the first 16 bytes are 8 16 bit floats, which will correspond to 2 Half4 elements in a vertex. The first 3 halves appear to be xyz. I'm still working on the remaining 24 bytes, but I anticipate that they're either "10,10,10", "11,11,10" or "10,11,11" 32 bit packed 3D floats. This from the Ford Fiesta linked elsewhere on the Xentax forums: [http://aj.uwcs.co.uk/f3/fiesta.png](http://aj.uwcs.co.uk/f3/fiesta.png).

ajmiles, cool, certainly looks like geometry although I don't quite recognize a fiesta there. 
and what format is that 16bit decimal value? if it's a float with only a 10bit mantissa that's just too low precision for a quality object. something like 5-10mm per step for a car size object. unless the implied 11th bit can bring it down to less than 1mm which I guess might just barely be enough

there should also be a facelist somewhere right? part of the vertex data somehow?

The index data is separated from the vertex data, and is in the form of a list of 0xFFFFFF delimited triangle strips.  Each segment piece has it's own indices that reference the bigger vertex block of data for each main segment.  The image he showed just might not be rendering all of the parts of the car, but I can definitely pick out the rear quarter panel and a gas cap

Yeah, it doesn't look very fiesta like . That was just one section of the fiesta file (I've not got as far as parsing the file properly like Ernegien). The format of the float is indeed just a sign bit, 10 bit mantissa and 5 bit exponent. I've got another picture of what I got from the BMW cockpit carbin here: [http://aj.uwcs.co.uk/f3/bmw.png](http://aj.uwcs.co.uk/f3/bmw.png). What's interesting though is that when I compare this cockpit to the M3 GTR '05 in the game itself, the cockpit doesn't match at all. The car that it does match is a non-GTR M3 (note the 4 gauge dashboard), strange for there to be a naming issue with their assets...

To be able to render the entire car I'm going to need to find some sort of mesh offset/transform to move each part into it's proper position. Each part is built around the origin, so rendering even just two pieces of the car in the correct position is proving difficult.

You could possibly be rendering different permutations of the same section.  Also, there are lots of unknown float values that I haven't really done much with so maybe the vertices are bounded and/or scaled for extra precision too?

hehe I gathered it's not the whole car but it still looks somewhat odd, both the form and seems like some ghost layers and some free vertices. I guess we'll see later.

as for elements being misplaced, I'd look for an xyz offset vector. maybe even a transform matrix

One of the unknown floats (perhaps position.w?) may infact be a per-vertex scale. When I was drawing the 'body' part of the cars (seen in the first screenshot) what made it look odd to me when it was rotating is that one end of the geometry looks very pinched/narrow. I'll spend a bit more time tonight trying to get more of the car rendering at once and see if I can figure out what the other halves are for. The unknown 24 bytes at the end may just be normals, binormals, tangents(?), (12 bytes), and possibly some bone weights/indices, although I don't imagine the cars have skinned animations applied to them?

There are numerous other things to account for, keep in mind.
UVW groups, smoothing groups, markers and nodes, vertice weights, etc.

ajmiles, what value range are the coordinates? +-1.0?
although I can't think of any good reason why the coordinates would be non euclidian. if they wanted to hack the 16bits for higher precision I'd think they'd just use integer 16bit space.
maybe for some unknown reason there is a distorting matrix for each element instead of just offset. 4x4 likely, somewhere near the vertex data. element header. anything like that inthere Ernegien?

as for vertex components, there could be a vertex normal (xyz) for the reflections, maybe a vertex color but not sure they'd use that for the game. I'm not an expert on photoreal hardware graphics.
you could also imagine a denting vector if the game has such.

The header has two suspicious floats located at 0x2B0 which I suspect are probably related to the two unknown lists that follow. There are other floats in the header, but I haven't noticed any changes in the dozen or so files I've compared with.

Then in the beginning of each main section there are 14 floats which could very well be bounding information or a matrix of some sort.  I'm sure some of these floats will probably make more sense in the context of the vertices you just decoded.  There are also floats that prefix the index data for each individual car piece, but those are usually constant and thus probably aren't used.

Other than that, those are pretty much all the stray information that I haven't already figured out.  The header, that has several integer-like differences which could possibly be checksums of some kind, then the two unknown lists of integer data which i was thinking might be used to determine which default parts get rendered on the car.

If you guys want to have a discussion on this stuff you can aim me (mjdpdu) or find me on IRC eefnet or gamesurge servers as 'xbox7887'

The xyz are definitely -1 to 1 as evidenced by these two images: [http://aj.uwcs.co.uk/f3/body1.png](http://aj.uwcs.co.uk/f3/body1.png) and [http://aj.uwcs.co.uk/f3/body2.png](http://aj.uwcs.co.uk/f3/body2.png).
That just shows every piece of the BMW M3 draw at it's natural location, no offset/scale.The vertices appear to form circles of radius 1 at one end and, as i mentioned, get pinched at one end. I don't really know what to make of this yet.

they had to make it difficult didn't they : )
if we're lucky it's just a matter of a scale float. but that would be too easy.
it looks like any scale would only be for two of the coordinates. it looks like it's in some kind of american football confinement or even weirder. 
could you export the fiesta rear part to dxf or something so I can take a look at it in a 3d editor to try to figure out what its major malfunction is?

I've managed to get the individual parts of the car rendering properly now: [http://aj.uwcs.co.uk/f3/bmwNoBulge.png](http://aj.uwcs.co.uk/f3/bmwNoBulge.png)
What I'm still missing, (and it isn't immediately visible in the 14 floats before each car section) is the translation for each part of the car. Some parts, like the rear window defrosting lines seem to render in the correct position, but there's still a lot of parts at the origin inside the car that shouldn't be there. [http://aj.uwcs.co.uk/f3/bmwFront.png](http://aj.uwcs.co.uk/f3/bmwFront.png)
Just a case of finding if this translation information is in this file at all, and if so, how to apply it. For reference, to get the xyz to render correctly, I had to multiply xyz by zzw, don't ask why.

ah, the z was never the z, the 4 floats were xysz where s was the scale?
and the reason for keeping the xyz within +-1 was presumably just to maximize the use of the 11bit mantissa space. the weird deformation was just a result of whatever normalizer they used. 

is that a vertex format any hardware can use? 16bit xyz and a scale? or is it really done just to save disk space? the objects couldn't be that big. must be a hardware supported format?

Here's my updated application that displays information to quickly compare with other car sections.  Just load either an lod0 or cabin .carbin file and click through the treeview.  It might require you to install xna framework redistributable 3.1 since I started adding basic render code.  The source is pretty much an abomination, but once everything is sorted out I'll go through and clean it up, and do the renderer with selective import/export features and a bunch of other goodies

No, I haven't done anything with vertex scaling or the face list yet.  The work left to be done to get model faces rendering properly is minimal considering the amount of progress made last night.  Ajmiles knows his shit and I'm confident that the rest of these unknown floats will be figured out very soon

My application will most likely just export to wavefront .obj where you can import into 3ds afterwards.  Thanks to ajmiles, I finally got a programmatic way of decoding some of the stuff and getting it rendered.  I'm finishing up the rest of the camera class, then I'll move onto rendering and exporting individual sections or parts of the car...

we need the smoothing groups too which I would guess is an integer for each face. 
material ID might also be an integer per face.
or rgb face or vertex color or int texture ID maybe.

Yeah faces are loaded, I'm just using a point rendermode temporarily until I append color data or texture coords to my vertex buffer so it doesn't look like a giant black box with no shading.  The format that I'm currently using is <x*z, y*z, z*w>. Smaller detail parts seem to use different transformations (notice the mess towards the origin), or maybe these scales are wrong to begin with since they seem kinda weird anyways.  The last 2 floats of the first packed 8 seem to be the UVs and the other 24 bytes we believe to be 32-bit packed data which means plenty of other per-vertex information as well.  If someone would like to take a look at decoding the .xds texture files that would be great  Honestly I don't know too much about this stuff so it's all a learning experience for me.  I was originally just doing this for a buddy so he can use them in his renders

Ernegien, look at the vertex math. try renaming the w to z and the z to s. makes more sense does it not..

chrrox, what would be easiest for you?  Dumps of each section of vertex data prefixed with the unknown floats in their header?

Got my app exporting pieces and sections which all seem to render ok.  They are a little rough and probably need to be scaled again by some unknown value for perfect precision.  These pictures pretty much confirm that the floats in the beginning of each section have something to do with positioning everything (and hopefully include some more scales ), since they all render fine separately... 

Also, my buddy brought up some other minor problems that will probably need to be addressed later on for proper skinning which are flipped faces (should be fixed when normals are extracted) or the combination of parallel adjacent triangle strips into a single polygon (not yet sure if this process is calculated or pre-defined).  These are most likely caused by my simple model ripping methods, but again, I'm not well versed in this area so I think things are going pretty well at the moment... 

I've attached my updated source.  It does very basic renders of the vertices and you can decide exactly what gets rendered by unchecking the boxes.  It will export all vertex information, or export face information for sections and pieces but does not do selective exporting based on checked pieces yet.  I started cleaning up the source but messed it up again, so go easy on me.  It's probably time to change the name of the application as well, so if you have any suggestions feel free to make them

very nice. yes it does look like that 16bit float is not precise enough. what a shame. might be possible to compute a slight repositioning of the vertices by normals if they are there. but wont be the easiest of algos.

but we have geometry at least.

still missing:
element offset (xyz float)
smoothing groups (guessing an integer per face, 8bit)
uv mapping (two floats per vertex, guessing 16bit)
material (might be vertex color rgb 8bit or face color or integer face texture id)

then it's pretty solid : )

Wow 

Your work is so amazing 

Is there any Way to Export the whole car and all parts on the right location?

Exporting the right offset/pivot would work too 





I hope I'm not too annoying to you but I noticed it's only working with Importing the OBJ Files in Blender and then Exporting OBJ Again from Blender if I want the car in Max or Maya?!

And I'm looking forward to new Version with fixed Normals/No Flipped Polys and so on

Sure, theres a way, I just haven't figured it out yet...

If someone wants to take a look at decoding the other 24 bytes of data, ajmiles mentioned one solution where there are 3 floats that get packed into 32 bits (10, 11, 11 bits for each float inside) where each one has a sign in the msb, a 4-bit exponent, and the rest is the mantissa.  I've calculated the masks and shifts needed to extract the individual pieces from the 32-bit dword.  If someone would like to test this theory that would be great, as I probably won't have much time to work on this stuff today... :/

I'll take another look tonight, but the 10/10/10, 11/11/10 and 10/11/11 formats I'm thinking about aren't in a floating point format, they only expand to that once read in the shader. If you take a look at [http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library ... S.85).aspx](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/microsoft.directx_sdk.reference.xmhendn3%28v=VS.85%29.aspx), that's the sort of format I'm thinking they may be in. That's the 11,11,10 version, the other two have similar structures in that Math library.

Those formats are useful for normals where the 10/11bit precision doesn't really matter. If there are any tangents/binormals those could be 3D unit vectors too.

I wouldn't expect to see a material ID of any kind though since the meshes already seem to be split up per material. "chrome", "matte_colors", "plastic" etc. I'm not familiar with smoothing groups so can't say whether those exist or not.

It'll be easier to tell whether the X and Y of the second half4 are UVs or not when we get the textures working, something I can look at doing perhaps this weekend.

EDIT: It's worth bearing in mind that the only formats these vertex attributes can be in are format that are readily consumable by the 360 GPU, so this rules out any sort of strange format. They aren't likely to spend their valuable load time decrypting super-compressed formats.

I do not believe for a moment that they do not allocate a bit of data for smoothing groups of the meshes.
The data is exported from the modeling program to their internal format retentive of all data that it left with.
MaterialID, smoothing groups, etc.
As aj pointed out, the materialID just tells the exporter how to break up the model further so there wouldn't be much need to save those in the model format.
But smoothing groups are a necessity.
The only other option for the engine to decide which areas to smooth on the model and to what degree otherwise would be an automated process.
And as anyone who has used a 3D modeling application knows, this is far too inaccurate. Much less for a triple-A title like Forza 3.

From what I've just read in the last 5 minutes about smoothing groups, that appears to me to be a feature more for the modelling tool that for DirectX/OpenGL to use at runtime. Once the vertices have been exported and given the appropriate normals, I don't see what information can be gained from having smoothing group ids, or what the vertex/pixel shader could do with that information if it had it.

Perhaps I wasn't articulate.
In the past with model formats from:
Halo 1
Halo 2
Halo 3
SDK tools for Halo: Custom Edition
Forza 2
FEAR
As well as a few others, all have used smoothing groups retained from source-exports.

Every current-generation game uses and retains smoothing groups in their model data.
You just cannot go without them.
Artists very carefully create them when making the model, as their poly topology depends on it.
To just... lose those wouldn't make any sense.

Side note:
I fixed up another model export-

ajmiles, if the vertices have normals then smoothing groups are no longer needed, that's right.

Edit: but that said, while the format wont need smoothing groups for rendering on hardware because it has the vertex normals, we are talking about extracting the geometry for use in editors and editors rarely take in vertex normal formats. so while the format might not have smoothing groups we have the reverse situation that we likely have to create the smoothing groups from the vertex normals.
or just live with autosmoothing them when we get them in the editor. auto smoothing will likely do quite well.

add to the mix of issues that we still have the low vertex position precision issue that will also need to be resolved through an algorithm aided by the vertex normals. otherwise the models will look dented because.. it is dented by the poor 16bit float precision. in the game they just fake the smoothness because they have the normals

Ernegien shouldn't have a problem fixing the flipped faces, I suspect it's just a case of not inverting the winding order every time he hits a triangle strip restart.

I'm not how easy it'll be to reconstitute the smoothing group information. Presumably smoothing groups exist so that vertices can be shared between polygons with different materials? (I think.) After the export to the vertex buffer has taken place any vertices that were shared were instead duplicated in each mesh that needed them. It may then be possible to find all the vertices that exist in more than 1 mesh, collapsed them into a single vertex and provide indices to which meshes/materials they belong?

ajmiles, no, smoothing groups is the information used to make (part of) a mesh not flat shaded. can be same material or across many. that's independent. smoothing group is actually a really sloppy system. a smoothing group is a group of faces that are to be rendered as one smooth surface. it contains no specific normals. all you have is the flat faces and the command to smooth them. the rest is implicit. it has some significant weaknesses but the advantage for editors is that it never has to deal with the extra layer of normals that have to be transformed just the right way which in general is impossible anyway.

since these cars are mostly nice continuous surfaces, the autosmooth function that most editors have will likely do a good job of remaking the smoothing group info. BUT we have to deal with the dented low precision geometry or the dents will just show up in the smoothing.
in the game they hide the dents because the vertex normals have no dents. which also means it's possible to refine the dented geometry with the aid of the presumably smooth vertex normal data.

it's interesting how that which looks so neat and apparent in a game is actually really messy

Mind you autosmooth will never work properly until quads are extracted rather than triangle strips.

ajmiles, well maybe I'm reading too much into it and it might not be a problem in practice after the smoothing but I'm looking at the shaded veyron on page 3, particularly the flat wheel arch. looks like there might be a minor unevenness but maybe that's just a result of optimization reducing the face count.
maybe it's not a problem in practice. would be easier. although clear reflections would amplify any perturbation. we'll see

I've confirmed tonight that at least 2 sets of 4 bytes towards the end of the vertex are one of the 11 bit combination formats, I've just not decided which one yet . Wherever you see 00 00 03 FF in the file, this is effectively 0 0 1023, which, assuming 11 bits for Z (-1023 to 1023) would indicate a vector of 0 0 1. The other common bit pattern you can see in the file is 00 00 04 01, which is 0 0 -1023, or the unit vector 0 0 -1. I've tested many of the non 00 00 00 03 / 00 00 04 01 bit patterns and they're all unit length vectors. The reason I've not quite decided which of the two 11bit packed format they are is because I could just be 1 bit out and the error may not be large enough to notice, and I'm also tired . I'll decide tomorrow which format they're in, and also investigate whether any of the other unknown 4 byte attributes are in a similar format.

It seems there is an issue surrounding those areas in particular I've noticed.
Whether it is vertice inaccuracy or simply because the mesh isn't in quads I do not know.
But smoothing groups tend to get scary around those areas, too.

EDIT: You can see what I mean around the wheel arches here


EDIT 2: Yup major issues

So every other strip I am supposed to scan ahead and start backwards?

Looking again at the sheer number of flipped faces (it looks like every other face is flipped, rather than just at strip restarts), it's more likely a case of not accounting for the fact that in a triangle strip the winding order inverts for every face drawn. So the first face will be clockwise, the second face is anti-clockwise, the third is clockwise, fourth is anti-clockwise etc. Try this, on alternate faces (either the odd or the even faces) output the indices in the "other" order. That is, if you had the faces (0,1,2), (1,2,3), (2,3,4), (4,5,6), try exporting this as (0,1,2), (1,3,2), (2,3,4), (4,6,5). So that the odd numbered faces are flipped.

If after doing that the entire car is culled, flip the even numbered faces.

Yeah, everything is fixed now, thanks for the earlier tip .  Every odd face is flipped (first two index pairs swapped) and the winding restarts at each new strip.

strip: 012345
(0, 1, 2),(2, 1, 3),(2, 3 4),(4, 3, 5) etc...

veegie, nice. yes it does appear that fine detail on the main body can be deformed but doesn't look like a huge problem. perhaps try autosmoothing it all and render it with a polished material and an environment map with detail in. a reflective material will show perturbations much stronger than matte finish. car paint is shiny so it will need to pass that test somehow.

I've thought a bit about an algorithm to refine the positions but to do it really well it will have to be somewhat sophisticated. it will have to recognize large shapes, not just the n closest vertices. but doable at some level. it can be done.

Ernegien, was your nickname supposed to be Energien? : ) anyway, from veegie's picture it would appear the geometry is mirrored. if that's a general issue, not editor specific, you should perhaps invert x or y

> veegie, nice. yes it does appear that fine detail on the main body can be deformed but doesn't look like a huge problem. perhaps try autosmoothing it all and render it with a polished material and an environment map with detail in. a reflective material will show perturbations much stronger than matte finish. car paint is shiny so it will need to pass that test somehow.
Tried it.
Even with standard car paint, the lack of quads and the small-scale deformations lead to incorrect smoothing groups.

veegie, the material has nothing to do with smoothing groups. but a shiny material will more clearly show perturbation in a surface. you have to render it.
as for smoothing, just set the smoothing angle high enough until it takes. try 45 degrees for instance. or even 60. that's less important with regards to the vertex precision issue.

i currently don't have any data available to me other than the BMW files posted earlier in the thread, would it be possible to get some more sample files?  i am trying to validate more of the things i have found so far.

Thanks in advance.

Dan, I am quite familiar with modeling applications and their workings. I had only mentioned because it seemed that you were insinuating that the appropriate material was the end-all solution.
Though it may just have been a misinterpretation on my end.
The autosmoothing doesn't do any better with higher angles, it just spreads the issue to more areas.
The issue is not a lack of smoothing with autosmooth, the issue is incorrect smoothing, a direct derivative of the incorrect geometry.
As you know, autosmooth simply assigns smoothing groups and tells the program, "This is smooth. This face is not.".
The problem is that when they creased their edges to smooth them out (from a geometry standpoint), the inaccuracy issue that we're facing is messing up the edge loops that go throughout that crease. This in turn causes the smoothing to mess up. No matter how you go about it, if you assign any combination of smoothing groups to those trouble-regions, it will look incorrect (as pictured previously).
We're just going to have to wait until the issue is cleared up.

Veegie, I know the situation.
smooth it, render it. show us. you got that? 
with a polished material on and a contrast filled environment like an HDRi blue sky with white clouds on.
this is the critical test the geometry will have to pass for photorealism use. this will allow us to see just how critical it is.

Render from 5ft away in a low contrast environment and the problem is quite noticeable.
Though I don't really know what this accomplishes.
The error is known and has been noted.

Veegie, nice. thanks. some of it is probably just low poly count but there does appear to be some precision issue. maybe be forced to fix that if possible.
how about a full view from eye height? how bad is that

I'm fairly certain that we need to scale the position (or maybe the offset values relative to the origin) by some unknown value present in the section header.  That would make the most sense, because the only scale we use now is 16-bit floats, but the header floats are all 32-bit and would provide an extra level of precision...

Larger version: [http://aj.uwcs.co.uk/f3/BMWNormals.png](http://aj.uwcs.co.uk/f3/BMWNormals.png)

As you might expect, normals are located in the 4 bytes immediately after the 2 Half4s. They're in the 11/11/10 format. There's some code here (adapted from the DirectX SDK) to extract the normalised vector from an unsigned integer: [http://pastebin.com/1CRzBGQG](http://pastebin.com/1CRzBGQG).

The first 3 floats in the unknown 14 floats are a positional offset per piece. I must have some axes messed up in my render as I have to treat them as yxz rather than xyz, but nonetheless, it all seems to be in place. The car ends up with about 3 rear wings and front bumpers all in the "correct" place. The wheel is still at the origin (as there's only one). I expect there's either wheel attachment data in the file somewhere or in a separate file.

Confirmed, not exactly sure what to make of the flipped x y coords though :X  For the wheels, there's probably some sort of wheelbase information since all you really need is width of car and length from center to front/back axles...

Here's my updated source with normals and correct positions aside from the wheel of course.  I still need to work on selective exportation and getting the models to render properly...

Regarding the wheels, there should be a scaling part there too.
Typically the wheels in the back are scaled an inch larger than the fronts, but it seems there is only a single model.

The fiesta has:

damage, damage_lod0
damagelights, damagelights_lod0
interior_lod0
leather2_nrm
lights, lights_lod0
nodamage, nodamage_lod0
plastic2_nrm

The BMW doesn't appear to have normal maps for leather or plastic.
The Aston Martin I have has a 'wood' too and again no normal maps. So it varies per car.

Bear in mind that the cars in game are coloured rather than textured, and any designs are done using their fancy decal system, which we aren't going to be able to reproduce.

X and Y of the second Half4 are the texture coordinates, but in reverse order (yx).
The interior texture is a 512x512 DXT5 which for in-game driving is probably quite adequate (but also the reason photo mode doesn't let you inside the car). The exterior texture is 2048x2048 but is only really that large because of the 'damage' (Scrapes, marks) data.

As for conversion, it'll take me a little while longer to refine the tool, at the moment it doesn't support the mipmaps and I've yet to find where in the file the width/height are stored, so it is rather a hack job at the moment. But you really aren't missing anything not having them.

Here's the updated source for my extraction tool.  I went ahead and flipped the z component of the position and normal and that seems to fix the smoothing problem.  Also got my render code working decent.  Lots of work still to be done, but the model extraction part should be pretty close to being finished, except for skins and whatever other goodies are in the vertex format

How is it that you're rendering both the outside of the car as well as the cockpit? When I looked at those two models separately it looked to me like they both included some of the same geometry.

For example, when I rendered the outside of the car, you can see the entire front doors, on the cockpit model you get the top of the doors. If you render both of those at the same time you're going to end up with the top of the doors twice. Are you manually removing some of the geometry when you import it so there's no overlapping?

Yes, first I Import lod0 and then cockpit.

And I remove all existing geometry from cockpit (ok to lazy on the window border for this picture but body part is deleted)

Another Question: 

Where are the liverys stored??

And is it possible to import the other things like caliper, discs from car folder and complete wheels, not only rims on /wheels/carname/carname.lod0.carbin ??

I attached a new sample: Ferrari #72 Team Alphand Aventures 550 Maranello GTS 
Download: [http://ul.to/krbksz](http://ul.to/krbksz)

But I dont know where the hell are the livery is?! Maybe in nodamage_lod0.xds ??






Edit #53753793476 

It seem's I am right. I attached a 2048x2048 DXT5 DDS Header and there is much blue like the ferrari:

[](http://www.abload.de/image.php?img=normms96.png) 

But I don't have any deswizzle experience or whatever is needed

I'm not sure if it's a problem with the exporter or 3ds max's importer.
But:
The smoothing groups are seemingly perfect, but come render time they fall apart.

Yes, the "race" cars that have a race livery on them almost certainly do have this stored in the texture itself, as you don't buy the car in different colours like you would a Fiesta or BMW. The only cars I have (the ones from this forum) are all road cars, so don't contain texture information for anything other than the interior and badges on the outside, the rest would be pixel shaded whatever colour the car was currently painted.

Good work so far guys. 

Stupid question - how do you get the car files? I don't have a XBox 360 but I do have the Forza 3 DVD.

Thanks.

No idea if you can use it, here are all shared Textures from the shared folder: [http://ul.to/ezte3p](http://ul.to/ezte3p)

I really appreciate the work being put into this from everyone involved. I will be honest I cannot wait for the final, or at least more stable version (textures, fixed smoothing etc)   

I did a small import test within Test Drive Unlimited, with the Ferrari 458 Italia.
(Ignore the skyline rims and interior, I use it as a base for the car to work)


Keep up the excellent work!

I found another problem 

I tryed to Open the A4 Touring Car (=DTM) but the program is Crashing.

It's not the only car which is crashing. If you want I can test all cars and give you a list from the "wrong" cars.

Here is the Error Log from the A4

My bad  

Heres the updated source and binary as usual.  I've been playing around with rendering normals to try and figure out what's going on.  If you flip the x and y and then invert everything it seems to be much more perpendicular than before, but all of that is commented out for now...

I think I got normals fixed, so if someone would be so kind as to import it into 3ds and check if the smoothing problems go away, that would be greatly appreciated .  All I have to work with is blender and I don't exactly trust its results...

Well, I'm confident that normals are extracting correctly now and I also fixed a "feature" where I was drawing all of the faces backwards.  The remaining issues either have to be caused by obj limitations (or my limited knowledge of their format), imperfect vertex precision, poor import support in blender, or something else well beyond my general understanding of these things

Alright, Ernegien and I were discussing the possible source of this problem.

As I stated before, the models currently are rendering perfectly in the viewport, but come rendering time with a reflective material the smoothing groups seemed to fall apart.

Below is the .obj import options currently being used for 3ds Max.


It seems that if you check, Normals: "from file" it imports and displays perfectly in the viewport, but renders with the issue.
If you import the normals "From smoothing group", it displays the problem in the viewport as well as in the renderer.
It seems that somewhere along the line the vertex normals are being converted (incorrectly) to a smoothing group.

The possible course of action to solve this is to allow for .3ds format exporting where smoothing groups are much more friendly.
Anyone else with any experience working with model formats, please leave your 2¢.

I dont understand why any program (3dsmax, lightwave, deep exploration, 3d converter) import obj wrong
for example in max2010 imported one-77 obj looks like that :S :
[](http://img27.imageshack.us/i/max1kh.jpg/)

Only blender import mesh correct, but then there is no UV map, nor parts

well as you can see in flat shade view, mesh isnt imported correct, because bumps everywhere, that's the reason causing ugly rendering
[](http://img30.imageshack.us/i/one77b.jpg/)[](http://img8.imageshack.us/i/one77a.jpg/)

one program shows that for all vertex while importing
[](http://img96.imageshack.us/i/errorjp.jpg/)

Alright, I compared few .obj files I have or made, in various programs to the one from forza and I noted differences that may cause problems. look at these lines, on the right side is model from forza

Not sure if helpful as I have really low skills in 3ds max etc. Anyways I use Deep Exploration to get obj to 3ds. Deep exploration can use its own smoothing while using it lately I have noticed this: I can select the smoothness type while using it but that's about it.

Original Smoothing:

Deep Exploration Smoothing:
[](http://img696.imageshack.us/img696/5405/desmoothing.jpg)

The model itself while in deep exploration has no flaws from my point of view.   Hope this is helpful in anyway.

Yep, I just open the obj in Deep Exploration. The errors from what I can tell are fixed within its own smoothing, I am not sure if I can get other formats to export with the smoothing applied.   I am trying to think what I can do.

Yeah, in Deep Exploration it seems like blender's results can be reproduced with smoothing angles higher than 35 degrees, otherwise things seem to render a little better, but I still notice some problems.  This could also be due to the fact of me using an older version (2.1) of the software.

Can you build in a function which allows hiding/showing Normals and the Wireframe on the Models?

And maybe if it's not to much choose the color of the car?

yes for me too the same.
Deep Exploration import bad, I cant see model, I tried in DE4, DE5.5 and DE6 (this one crash) too.
The same in 3dsmax and Lightwave, the mesh is very broken (doest look like car anymore lol), which looks like on the pic i posted in previous post
the only way to import it is use Blender but then model looks like on toolieo pics with Original Smoothing, which cant be fixed anymore in DE

Yeah, saving .3ds in deep exploration to get zmodeler to open it has the orignal smoothing.  I changed some settings etc in deep exploration but always orignal smoothing.

ofcourse. the problem is not smooth angle but I think bumpy mesh, I blame for that obj codding I think. Just see how model looks in flatshades.

maybe direct .3ds exporter would be better than .obj

This one would be better anyway. Import to 3ds max from start.

Not really 3ds makes only more problems.

I would suggest (Open) Collada one of the best formats

What about just select what you want to export?  (obj, 3ds etc)   

Would be way too much work I would assume, all comes down too what Ernegien wants to do with formats.

This is unrelated to Forza 3 -- but to the developer of the Forza Moto Ripper / Forza Studio. I used your code as a stepping stone into understanding how to easily render mesh content through XNA (for making a Just Cause 2 model viewer).

One of the things that irked me was how the camera handled, I basically ripped it out and replaced it with the [XNA Camera](http://www.dhpoware.com/demos/xnaCamera.html) from here, which is much better (in my opinion).

I did hack it up a bunch to make it work nicely in a WinForms form though. My code is available [on my SVN repository](http://svn.gib.me/public/avalanche/trunk/Gibbed.Avalanche.ModelViewer/).

Glad my code was able to help  XNA was really a learning experience for me as well getting it to work on win forms.  I found out the hard way that the keyboard and mouse classes need to be running on the same thread as the application, and the BasicEffect class was giving me problems with rendering colored primitives without normal values and found out that you need to disable lighting beforehand.  Other than that it's pretty easy to use...

Also, have you downloaded one of the few most recent sources and taken a look at the newer camera?  The really old camera wasn't functioning very well due to it operating on a different axis.  I rotated the model correctly and it functions much better now.  I'll still have a look at the one in your link and see if I prefer it over the one I wrote.  It would actually be nice to have an option to select which kind of perspective to use

(In the process of rewriting everything to use SlimDX instead, lack of D3D10 means no game shader support... ).

Got a message from a friend on msn, who has been looking at these models and this is his opinion about the smoothing errors etc. 

> i've noticed the normals problem is caused on the area where poly are dence like in the places with chamfer
>
>  and close distances between poly and they are somehow weld automatically and that's what cause the bumps on the model

Trying to help out.

Apparently the Forza tool some coding correction? to disable auto welding within the .obj Or something rather. Cause some reason within the .obj polys that are close they get auto welded, result is dark areas etc. If it was disabled somehow then, I believe it would maybe fix it.

I'll try my best to see if he could sign up here and explain.

no, i don't agree at all that this is weld vertex problem.
it seems like points arent imported correct, i can see clear that they are offset, I might blame for that obj coding or so.
please look at these pics so u will understand the problem
[](http://img687.imageshack.us/i/ast2j.jpg/)[](http://img338.imageshack.us/i/ast1.jpg/)

lets compare this to other model, that is correct. i took db9 from J2
maybe is not that high poly, but u can see how should look flatshade view of correct mesh. not dark-light places

ok problem found!
i hardly ripped model from Forza Studio by 3dprintscreen (too bad I can only view a model there), but what I can see, mesh is perfect, no bumps.
[](http://img526.imageshack.us/i/astgood1.jpg/)
so now is clear that .obj exporter is damaged or so


what about export to this free program [http://zmodeler2.com](http://zmodeler2.com) ? there is sdk

Zmodeler 2 sucks!

If you Export the Models as 3ds you get only Damaged Normals... (Export from Zm2)

I would prefer Open Collada and then you can Import in Maya, Max without any Errors. 

Zmodeler 2 is only great for exporting to game files like GTA IV, NFS Shift. But Export to 3D Apps sucks because of damaged Normals...

That's why I never export as .3ds from zmodeler LOL. .ase or .x much better way of export from it 

if you say .dae is that good, is worth try, because this .obj fails. I hope is not a problem make .dae exporter. I mentioned 3ds because i though it might be easy to code.

Problem is Open Collada is written in #C, Forza Studio in C++ 

[http://code.google.com/p/opencollada/so ... wse/trunk/](http://code.google.com/p/opencollada/source/browse/trunk/)

But I'm sure Ernegien is able to write a C Wrapper and use this

It's easy to translate C# and C++ are similar but with a few differences.

I'm not so sure it's an obj exportation issue.  All I export is vertices, normals, and faces and I've tried unwinding the faces a few different ways, none with different results.  I still feel this may be a precision issue, or something entirely else.  The only reason why you can't see these imperfections in my renderer is because it's not using any reflective surface, just simple shading...

I have tried the 3D print screen on the forzastudio as tomwin did and I can confirm that the shading is perfect. Then I would also assume that the mesh reading in forzastudio is OK. When I then use xml to max conversion script by koichi I have the same shading problems as if I import the obj and very similar to what the people are refering in the pictures.

Good work btw and thanks for zour effort!

and what more? why dont u make textures self? stop act like unpatient kid who want to do a mod quick. we try here solve more important problems than your impatience.

@ Varel: yes saddly, I tried now, and the problem appeared again. so must be something wrong with forza studio or other possibility Turn1 protected models somehow so is not easy import them correct.

@ Veegie: nice, saddly bumps arent gone.

Veegie and I have pretty much confirmed that the smoothing problem can be fixed by manually adding smoothing groups.  I took another look at the vertex data and don't immediately see any ids that could be used as such, but there are also the possibility of blended vertex weights or UVW coordinates that wrap around different smoothing groups.  I'm not exactly sure how these things operate quite yet, so instead I started writing a function to manually loop through the vertices and read the normals which would kind of botch together some rough smoothing groups.  This algorithm has lots of problems in itself that I won't bother going into, but it should serve my purpose of testing for smoothing groups.  I'm going to need to take a little break on this project and concentrate on school matters for a few days, but here's the code where I left off if anyone is interested...

```
int smoothingGroup = 1;
while (true)
{
    Vector3 baseNormal = Vector3.Zero;
    bool unassignedVertexFound = false;
    for (int i = 0; i < Vertices.Length; i++)
    {
        if (Vertices[i].smoothingGroup == 0)
        {
            if (!unassignedVertexFound)
            {
                // first one
                baseNormal = Vertices[i].normal;
                Vertices[i].smoothingGroup = smoothingGroup;
                smoothingGroup++;
            }
            else
            {
                // continue checking differences...
                float angleDifference = (float)(Math.Acos(Vector3.Dot(baseNormal, Vertices[i].normal)) * (180 / Math.PI));
                if (angleDifference < 30.0f)    // angle threshhold
                {
                    // part of same smoothing group
                    Vertices[i].smoothingGroup = smoothingGroup;
                }
            }
            unassignedVertexFound = true;
        }
    }
    if (!unassignedVertexFound) break;
}
```

Me and Veegie figured out that the exporter works fine, and the reflective problems he has been experiencing is related to exporting information from 3ds to Maxwell.  Individually, importing and rendering works fine in both, but something goes wrong in the transfer between the two.  Here's the updated source with a few extra visual options that I haven't really organized into a proper menu yet.  Lots of things still need fixing but this is where I'm at so far...

Yes, something wrong with Blender or Maya 

Basically, Forza models don't seem to play nice with anything other than Max.  Currently, I do not export any smoothing group information (if there even is any), aside from per-vertex normals.  Max seems to be able to calculate smoothing information automatically on its own just from the normals given (as well as the directx rendering engine).  It works fine in Max, it's what the Forza 3 devs used, and unfortunately I'm not really interested in making it work in anything else at this current moment...

Ernegien, do you export to .max? does .max support vertex normals? I wouldn't think it does.

btw when multiplying the coordinates with the scale factor, do you convert both values to 32bit float before multiplication? just to be sure no additional precision is lost.
the 16bit floats are not very precise so some inaccuracy is to be expected as we also seem to find. the only way to fix it is some semi fancy algorithm that uses the vertex normals and the general shape to estimate a more precise position for a smoother surface. but not easy and not critical. can be added when everything else is done

The "damaged" areas you see there are bad shading caused by improper smoothing.  Blender tries its best, but it's just not good enough...

Dan, this definitely isn't a precision issue here.  Vertex normals are a pretty basic feature that virtually all modeling programs will recognize.  Max's smoothing algorithm seems to use them differently than the others, as everything shows up correctly in Max.

n00b moment: Anyone wanna let me know what are the import settings for obj? Cause I still get unsmoothed models.   




Or am I doing something wrong? My only guess would be import settings.

Thanks.   

general question: what 3dsmax do you use? cause 'triangulate polygons' I do not have as a option.

Even if rip model from Forza Studio with 3d ripper DX in 3ds max we will have the same crap like in blender. But in forza studio model has a proper smooth.

No idea Max 2010 here, same Options like you but Red Dot near Smoothing Groups?

And Imported Model looks like Toms...

I tested with the same car like in your Picture (Lambo)

> Yes, first I Import lod0 and then cockpit.

And I remove all existing geometry from cockpit (ok to lazy on the window border for this picture but body part is deleted)

Another Question: 

Where are the liverys stored??

And is it possible to import the other things like caliper, discs from car folder and complete wheels, not only rims on /wheels/carname/carname.lod0.carbin ??

I attached a new sample: Ferrari #72 Team Alphand Aventures 550 Maranello GTS 
Download: http://ul.to/krbksz

But I dont know where the hell are the livery is?! Maybe in nodamage_lod0.xds ??

Edit #53753793476 

It seem's I am right. I attached a 2048x2048 DXT5 DDS Header and there is much blue like the ferrari:

 

But I don't have any deswizzle experience or whatever is needed

I think this was a fluke caused by the differing endianness. I've got this for the nodamage_lod0 texture on that Ferrari. It wouldn't surprise me now if the liveries for the race cars are done using the same 'livery' tools that the players use in game and that there aren't any textures.

I am experiencing the same problem as TomWin and others. The obj file is not correctly displayed in max (9as well as 2010). If I open the file in Blender (the only program that opens obj files created by forza somehow correctly) and export as obj and then it is possible to see the model but with the crippled normals.

I think I have the solution for our problem with 3dsmax!!!

The .obj file is using , instead of . (0,004 not 0.004)   

If you change those the model is ok and with proper normals!

well, that's great 
but any idea how to do it quick? because changing every , in notepad manually may take hours

I hope we can get updated Forza Studio soon then

```
output.WriteLine("v {0} {1} {2}", v.x, v.y, v.z);
```

with 

```
output.WriteLine("v {0} {1} {2}", v.x.ToString().Replace(",", "."), v.y.ToString().Replace(",", "."), v.z.ToString().Replace(",", "."));
```


Replace

```
output.WriteLine("vn {0} {1} {2}", v.normal.X, v.normal.Y, v.normal.Z);
```

with

```
output.WriteLine("vn {0} {1} {2}", v.normal.X.ToString().Replace(",", "."), v.normal.Y.ToString().Replace(",", "."), v.normal.Z.ToString().Replace(",", "."));

Save Car.cs

Open CarPiece.cs

Replace

```
output.WriteLine("v {0} {1} {2}", Parent.Vertices[i].x, Parent.Vertices[i].y, Parent.Vertices[i].z);
```

done in Notepad++
and well we have a big problem, because mesh is already bumpy in Forza Studio, bumps are somehow masked by hmm no idea what, but please take a look on that pic:
[](http://www.imagebam.com/image/c7397a77028965/) 
export to obj and then 3dsmax works perfect, but look at poly structure, is total mess (just covered by some dunno some advanced normals), bumps everywhere, none modeler make such ugly poly structure:
[](http://www.imagebam.com/image/5c923877028974/) [](http://www.imagebam.com/image/2e519f77028977/) [](http://www.imagebam.com/image/2c4c4877028980/) 
so export to  any other format/program cause model look like that

tomwin, as I have stated several times, because the vertices are only in 16bit format they have precision issues. it can perhaps be handled with a very fancy algorithm that tries to reconstruct the lost precision using the vertex normals as help and the general shape of the geometry. that's not an easy algorithm to make though. it would likely take me a considerable amount of time to get right should I some day choose to do it.

and it's not a huge problem. it's not like the overall model is useless as it is.

extracting the geometry with material and mapping coordinates should be the primary focus.
then someone should perhaps extract all the models and prepare them in max and make a torrent and spread it on the net. no reason all people should use the software if they just want to play with the models.

You can import that fine even with just obj, if you disable deep exploration's smoothing it becomes the orignal smoothing (bumpy in other words)   
------------

Exporting from 3dsmax keeps orignal smoothing aswell. So I don't think there is anyway possible to export from 3dsmax and keeping it smooth. Unless someone knows a way around this.

I import model with recompiled Forza Studio with settings in 3ds max 2010 which had been posted on previous page.
Here is result:

When i import into 3ds max it looks ok at fist but when i switch to poly mode you can see the problem.
1st: [http://i41.tinypic.com/2r5e2v8.jpg](http://i41.tinypic.com/2r5e2v8.jpg)
This is what it is exporting
2nd: [http://i39.tinypic.com/35kvi8k.jpg](http://i39.tinypic.com/35kvi8k.jpg)
Imported into zmodeler
3rd: [http://i42.tinypic.com/20s7laq.jpg](http://i42.tinypic.com/20s7laq.jpg)
I can fix it, but is there any way to export it so it looks like the first image?

minime, we think it's a vertex position precision problem. the reason it looks good to begin with seems to be that max can use the 'fake' vertex normals that are also used in the game to make the surface appear smooth even though the geometry actually isn't smooth. so what you are seeing to begin with is not actually better geometry. just masked errors.

you said you can fix it. how did you fix it? manually moving single vertices?

I still don't believe that this is a precision issue.  Each 16-bit float has a 10-bit mantissa with 1/2^10 precision.  Since these values are bound between -1 and 1, this cuts the precision in half which equals 0.001953125.  Now if it stopped there, yes I would agree this isn't enough precision but these values are each scaled yet again by an equally precise value so when you square that you get an actual precision of 0.000003814697265625 which is more than enough for the purpose they serve.  Please correct me if my math is wrong as it's been a while but this seems to be correct on first inspection 

After some tests and lots of discussion, Veegie and myself think that the normals may in fact be remnants of quad face data from the original models.  When they went to convert their original models to game models, they would break up the model faces into triangle strips.  When 3ds max imports this data for the first time, it seems to use the old normals present in the file, but any modification seems to force new normals to be calculated and in some areas they are quite different from the originals which cause these improper smoothing issues...

As far as 3d studio max is concerned, i get the weird polygon structuring as well with 2009.  i also think it is a "precision" issue, not with the half float conversion but within the obj importer for 3d studio max.  i imported the same obj that give erroneous output into Milkshape 3d an the mesh shows fine, as it does within your application. LOD1 - LOD5 from the main carbin file do not seem to exhibit the problem anywhere near as badly, if present at all.  i am guessing either the floating point precision within max during or after the conversion from the text strings within the file could be causing an issue.  if it is not that then there is another issue with the obj importer itself as rendering normally in d3d/opengl as your app and milkshape do respectively do not seem to show the problem.  As such i highly doubt it is an error in the half float conversion or the text output.  But i will continue testing and see what i can find.  Expect a pm soon with regard to getting past the "header" information in the file so that the main carbin files can be opened in your program (or tell me if this was already supposed to work, heh).

Ernegien, that's definitely wrong. the precision doesn't improve like that in multiplication. it's a bit complicated to say what the exact step size is because x y and z is not just limited to +-1 they appear to be limited to length 1 of the xyz vector and then scaled. so z y and z are not just free within +-1. but in the simpler case of just one coordinate and a scale both within 1 and say a step size of 0.1 then the extra scale doesn't suddenly allow you to find ten more steps between 0.9 and 1.0. that scaling factor doesn't let you hit 0.98 for instance. roughly speaking I think you can say that the initial stepsize is not improved and even worsened by the scale factor. if we say the precision within 1meter is 2mm (might only be 1 with the implicit extra digit in the float representation, not sure) and then the object is 5 meter in length then the step size is something like 2.5mm-5mm. maybe even as bad as 8mm in some cases.
and you'll mainly see precision issues with large objects.

I believe the precision issue is real. and we can just live with it or try to develop the fancy correcting algorithm.
but I strongly suggest that you all forget about it for now and not bring it up until such time everything else works.
we need the cars extracted as they are, then we might look at making the models even better than they are on the disc

Alright, I would have to agree with you there as I didn't entirely think things through.  Regardless, I still feel the same as the models are capable of showing up fine in some instances.  It is therefore an issue with the normals and or smoothing groups in my opinion.

think of a surface made of legos. it is stepped. but if you clothe the points in normals that can have any direction and interpolate between only the normals then the shading will look as if the surface is smooth. it is not a smoothing group issue. 
the vertex normals cloak the precision problem. that's counter intuitive because the vertex normals can actually be something that the geometry itself isn't. it's fake. it works for games. it doesn't work for editors.

i am just attempting different applications.  The screen shots are from Milkshape 3D.  3d studio max shows about the same as other posts here, so i was going to wait until i had side by side LOD comparison shots to be able to post something different from that.

i'm not very good in 3d modeling, i want to ask, i managed to copy only the vertices, without the polygons and the tag, which is creating the smooth surface.  is there a way now to generate new polygons?

Well, as promised, here is an update version of Forza Studio that should allow you to open most carbin files, though mainly the base carbin files that contain the other lod levels.  i am a c++ programmer and not up on much of the c# additions i probably just jammed things in around the parts that were there that weren't complete.  Still kind of a hack, but maybe this will allow us to find out the other missing bit to get past the beginning data in a more clean manner.  i meant to delete the commented out code beforehand, but i forgot.  There should also probably be a way to select car pieces by LOD level as there can be up to about 5 or so different resolution models rendering at a time.

Hope it helps (and i didn't break anything in the process).

Also, if there is anyone with experience disassembling direct3d/360 shaders i could use your help, heh.

if is a precision issue  then it very low precision, because cant explain other words how the models looks like

yes here doesnt look that bad (untill I export from 3dsmax)
[](http://img404.imageshack.us/i/one77aaa.jpg/)
but polys structure is just horrible (looks like mountains lol)
[](http://img13.imageshack.us/i/one77aab.jpg/)

no idea what it is, I know nothing of C++, but I do model cars and I never seen something like that.

One theory could be that developers put some protection that don't allow export models correct from game.

Oh sorry, this was not an update related to precision issues, or whatever the actual cause will eventually turn out to be.  This should add support for loading the other carbin files that did not load originally because of the hard-coded values in the loading code.  So now the other 5 LOD level that are in bmw_m3gtr_05.carbin, bug_veyron_09.carbin, and other base carbin files, as well as the caliper and brake files, etc.  At least so far, still testing carbin files, so if you find any that don't work, let me know.

Does this also allow opening of rim files? Cause there is some custom rims that did crash the Forza studio.

I dont think it does as i have tryed it and it failed for me.

Also models are good in milkshape 3d but again when you export it screws up.

Ok, i will see if i can get wheels working. i can get past the header differences, but as i feared, there are actually carbin files that have valid data for both vertex sections.  i'll have to check the other types when i get the chance.

i thought those were in the same files (the ones in the Wheels directory)?

the vertex data is split between two possible locations.  Location 0 is for LOD1+ and Location 1 is for LOD0 data.  Since i now know it is possible for files to have both sections valid at the same time, some changes need to be made in order to keep both sets of data around and pull from the correct one based on the LOD.  Hopefully it won't take me too long, and i will apologize in advance to the original creator for butchering his code base, heh.  Hopefully it won't be too hard to clean up after the fact.

I found a big error 

I opened the ast_009_dbr9_08.carbin and there are some lods for every part (lod1, lod2, lod3, lod4, lod5)

I can Display/Hide them, all working fine.

Lod1:

....
Lod5:


But if I want to export this, all Lods are joined together in one part. Maybe one Solution is to create a new loop which names the several Parts partname_lod1 partname_lod3 and so on? The lod0 File doesn't need this loop... hm

Thanks for taking the time and looking into this.  It seems like you've fixed a few simple mistakes of mine (flipping xy offsets and some other stupid things  ), cleaned up certain sections, and messed up others .  I'm still pretty busy with other things at the moment but looks like the majority of the .carbin file format has been figured out now.  Glad to have you on board

Watch one or two Sites back - you have to change a little bit in the source code 

Or replace all , with . in the obj File

I'll die of happiness when that happens.   

Nice render, is that one of the LOD models? or just the LOD1 model? Either way that looks epic, I need to learn how to render like that.

Level of Detail.

Lod0 = Most Details, Lod5 = least details

It's used to get a stable framerate by nearly every Game 

Cars which are far away using the lod5 Model with only 2000 Polys. Nearest Cars are using a better Model

Oh woops my mistake that's what I meant LOD0.    LOD1 body's poly count would be a excellent, would mix with games that do not support interior view NFS:Most Wanted as a example.


Edit: Just noticed the LOD1 interior fits the LOD0 model, so if anyone who ever wanted a high poly model but not a good interior then you can always use LOD1's interior.

Please do not make such requests in this thread as I and many others are only going to ignore them.  This topic is about the research, not taking requests and ripping models for everyone...

Ernegien, let's not pretend what we are doing doesn't violate what the stiff suits want. extracting the models is ripping and playing with the models is not the same as pirating the game.

Ernegien, there are several useless posts here but you reacted to the one that made you a hypocrite. he would like to play with the models just as you do. you were probably just afraid of how other hypocrites would react.. 

btw come to think of it, my guess is you can find a torrent of the game and extract the car files from that. probably the easiest while not making this into a warez thread

I've got to admit Dan, I think that's very cool of you to be so helpful to noobs (such as myself) but maybe a little too helpful my friend    It's not the best idea to condone downloading a pirate copy of a game in order to play with it's internals. At least not publically anyway. I appreciate your help, but I don't think even at my noob state that such a recommendation is such a good idea. I was wondering myself (as an owner of the original game disc with a backup on the xbox's HDD) if the Datel Xport would be a useful tool to help me find the .carbin files? Otherwise I can't work out how you obtain these files?   

GREAT thread though! I am sooo impressed with what you guys have achieved!

@ sommergemuese: yay great work, thanks for update script.
I wish to help with that UVs and textures, but all I know (or better say knew years ago) is Turbo Pascal:(

@ Ernegien: thanks for your great work, to make possible extract models for F3. I dont think we should care kids like Slyde who come with requests only. things like this happens everywhere and Im bored of that.

I was thinking about this bumpy mesh problem. maybe it's because x360 is 128bit, not like PC that is 32/64 bit, so precision problem appears. Other thing could be that maybe models are made in quads or nurbs in game hmm. just my theory

@ Slyde: go and buy that game

Reverse engineering and condoning piracy are not the same thing, Dan.
Now please, stop making sensless posts.
Ernegien has clearly refuted every possible aspect of the argument against precision issues.
It is a normal issue  most likely based off of the recalculation needed by modeling applications that can only be done on existing geometry, which in this case is not the source-quad form, but rather tristrips.
The way forward at this point is the .3ds format.
Once that is tried and tested, we will look at other options should they be needed.
But currently that is the direction Forza Studio will be taking.

revelation: Thanks for all of your help.

veegie, of course you know that typical 3d editors have no vertex normals right..
I think I understand the situation just a bit better than you do.

forget about smoothing, normals and geometry precision for now. just extract the geometry as is and get the materials and UV mapping right. then we can perhaps later look at making the geometry even better than it is in the game.

i have used it in the past, but it has been a while.  i can work on refreshing my memory if need be though, heh.  i am also looking into disassembling the game's shader code, as this should give me a bit more information on how some of the other parameters in the vertex structure are used, as well as verify whether the scaling is the only modification necessary for the position information.  i can be somewhat certain already by the fact the shader variable is called 'scaledPosition', and 'radius' being used in a couple places in the executable code (and the fact there is visible output, heh) that if anything things are initially correct in their interpretation.  Still seeing if it can be determined what other values in the files are used in correlation with the current data.

3D SimEd is fully working without any Smoothing Problems if you Export from Max with Open Collada  This means we can get the models in other Games

Though as much as that does work, loads smooth etc. When trying to convert into either a Rfactor or GTR2 etc format. 3dsSimEd needs to cut out vertices as the games have limits. 

Example: The Aston one-77 has 82842 vertices and Rfactor can only use 65535 vertices, the result is a really horrible basically half the model is gone.   

Only chance getting it to any GTR2, Rfactor, Or even TDU which I need, GTR Evo, NFS Shift etc would be Zmodeler. That would be the only way. However these carry the body issue's to zmodeler, as I have shown in images. 

That problem is annoying..

I think this was a fluke caused by the differing endianness. I've got this for the nodamage_lod0 texture on that Ferrari. It wouldn't surprise me now if the liveries for the race cars are done using the same 'livery' tools that the players use in game and that there aren't any textures.

Sorry if I ask again and again and again but are you sure that you deswizzled this Texture complete?

Reason is this:

You can see a part of the livery, Leaseplan Advert and you can see the blue pixels around that, which comes from the Livery Color for sure.

Here unedited:

Here that you can read it better:


But on the other side I could be very wrong there's no Mapping where the Logo is.

Not until I can get something written that uses only code written by me / people whose permission I have to use their source code.

sommergemuese: The race cars can't be painted (except maybe with extra decals?) therefore the texture is free to be outlined in blue. I imagine that particular logo was deemed to difficult to make using the decal system so they just made it part of the texture. I'm very confident that the textures I've shown are exactly what's supposed to be there.

Correct.
If you try to paint the car or apply your own decals, it clears the car completely of the racing livery design and you start with a blank canvas.

Wasn't for show.   

It was a comparison with the Turn10 veyron wireframe, they use quads. So it  could maybe be something to be looked at.

Hello! 

I think I have found a issue with the UVs

I Exported the #72 Ferrari 550 (the Blue one), and the Texture can be found here (from ajmiles): 

[](http://img683.imageshack.us/i/nodamagelod0.png/)

As you can see the Ferrari Emblem/Logo can be found on the Top Right of the Texture.

Rendered UV-Template from the Ferrari: 
[](http://www.abload.de/image.php?img=uvgo0b.jpg)

This means you have to Mirror/Flip the UVs while exporting somehow.

(The F550 Textur is only working in Max if I Flip it Vertical in Photoshop. And it's the first time I see this with game models. And not very useful too )

If you just Paint on the Template, Place a Logo all Logos are Mirrored on the 3D Modell 

Here how it looks in Photoshop after flipping (and working in Max):


To show it better *G* (I have to much time lol)

Texture (which is wrong flipped, the Logo is in the Bottom, but how it should look without mirroring): 


This Texture in Max:


I never had this "problem" with Game Models from other Games like NFS Shift, GTR 2, rFactor...

So?.. The textures are mapped like this?   (Using your UV and ajmiles texture)

Yep, and I'm 100% sure that the texture is correct and the UV Mapping incorrect. 

They would never Flip the whole Texture after Editing, makes no sense

Sure sounds like it, as much as this sounds strange. Even when I think about it, Ernegien's first Forza tool had exported the car mirrored, maybe? that's how it was originally meant to be.... Then add the UV? you'd get it matching the texture I think. 


Edit: Actually ignore that theory...

It's just a calculation error. 
Flipping the UVs won't be difficult and should only take a few minutes, nothing more.

I think it's here but no Idea what to change for it ^^

(the two uv Lines)

```
position.X = x = x * s + parent.flt1;
position.Y = y = y * s + parent.flt2;
position.Z = z = z * s + parent.flt3;

uv.X = u;
uv.Y = v;

// create vertex element
Element = new VertexPositionNormalColor(position, normal, Color.Gray);
```

uv is not used consistently throughout the code, so you will have to do like the position above and:

uv.Y = v = 1.0f - v;

Some vertex declarations used have multiple uv coordinates, as well as extra position values for the damage morphs.  i was going to attempt playing around with them hen i got the chance, so i added the extra variables.  Hadn't gotten to cleaning things up yet.

Finally some people finds out how to import Forza 3 models into
differnt 3D programs.
I ve been reading the whole topic.
The only thing thats naggling, how to get the models imported
into differnt programs?
I see many bugs like normals, weird and other not funny bugs
but as a 3D modeler I can fix them.
Textures aint that problem since I made high detailed textures.
Especially for LP640.

Cheers!

Hi peoples!!

I think I found a Solution for the Smoothing/Editable Poly problem.

What I have done:

1. Exported a Car from Forza Studio
2. Imported the Obj in 3DS Max 2010
3. Exported as Open Collada dae (not the FBX one!) *1
4. Imported in 3D SimEd *2
5. Exported as Open Collada dae
6. Imported in 3DS Max/Maya (NOT the FBX one!) *3



*1 Open Collada: [http://www.opencollada.org](http://www.opencollada.org)
*2 3D SimEd Demo: [http://www.sim-garage.co.uk/SimED_Demo.htm](http://www.sim-garage.co.uk/SimED_Demo.htm)
*3 You can export as Obj from 3ds Max after Open Collada Import and then use in ANY 3D App!

Huh, nice isn't it?

Gave it a try and I have the full 3dsimed and that isn't working for me either. Tried several times.  Unless you set different settings for the dae while exporting for 3dsmax. Should mention even in 3dsimed the car is invisible and cannot see it.  

I do think in my honest opinion though. Thats alot of mucking around, cause 3dsimed isn't free and can only export 50? objects. I have the full version of it but it would be unfair for others who would like to use these models.

These body issues etc is really driving me insane.

Yes

Little how to *g*
1. Open & Export the car you want



2. Import 2 Files (first one then the other) in Max 2010


3. Remove Overlapping Geometry (pillar). Press H for this Dialog


4. Export as OpenCollada



5. Fire Up 3DSimEd Demo and hit Import, Choose Exported OpenCollada File.


6. Export as Open Collada



7. Import in Max as Open Collada


8. Convert to Editable Poly


9. Evidence that it works:

Hm. Guys you do something wrong. I export car from Forza studio to obj format. Then import OBj into 3ds max convert everuthing into editable poly and just export to 3ds and import into zmodeler. And everything is ok. Except materials is missing but UVMapping are still there.

Amazing how you guys succeeded to import these models.
Finally a gamecompany thats not acting like a pu*** and softy about
the polycounts.
Much better than EA and TDU.
Too smooth models.


Wasting around an half year.
But atleast I know 3D modeling/editting.

Energien, your job is fucking amazing!
So the files finally have been investigated after half year or more.

Ow yeah, how you guys export from Forza Studio?
Atm Im on a damn shitpc as hell wich has a fking stupid chipset and CPU.
I'll be later on my highend laptop wich supports high detailed models.

And ow, anyone tried exporting on Vista x64?
I see XP cant do it right like on Windows7.

That's pointless, if models has already messed mesh in Forza Studio. I passed all the steps and it looks the same lol. These bad normals can be fixed only by hand or check out what is wrong with FS import code. No idea maybe they already looks like that in game lol.

They look pretty damn similar to me  considering the differences in the perspective and lighting, as well as the game obviously not being able to render physically real simulations at 30+ fps...


Also,

Forza 'Official' wireframe: Video here:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTFMZTYGrWk

This pretty much confirms the theory of the models originally being constructed mostly out of quads   When the game developers export their model data to the .carbin format, they preserve the original quad normals to keep the original smoothing, but convert to triangle strips for ease of use in DirectX.  Therefore, the smoothing problems we have all been experiencing are NOT dependent only on precision as I've stated multiple times before, but instead caused when the wrong normals automatically get recalculated by modeling programs based on the existing triangle data.  Sure, precision may be a small factor in the wrong recalculation of these normals because of the datatypes used, but the original quad normals will cover all of that up...

If using 3ds Max to import Forza Studio exports, the smoothing is perfect because there's an option to import normals from file.  Unfortunately any changes made to the mesh or when you export to certain formats it will recalculate normals based on existing tris and then have smoothing issues.  Unfortunately I don't think there is much we can do here aside from forcing modeling programs to use only the normals given and explicitly telling them to not recalculate, or reconstruct quad data on our own based on what we already know about its normals...

And it's working in Games fine too

Because normals are being calculated off of the existing geometry when you do that rather than the actual source-quads.
This has been established.
Can you guys please stop bickering about this until quads can be finalized or the mxs exporter can be re-written?
We know of the problem.
We know what causes it.
We know how to fix it.

That is all.

@Ernegien:  Glad to hear that image was able help to you. Now.. hmm how to fix it? or solve this crap.     Might hit up some programs later and see if I can change the settings on it. See if I can force it to use normals from file etc

The same thing is on release version of Forza 3. Turn10 screwed up with some models. Normals on them are not properly.
Maybe it's a shadr problem or something but smoothing on them are not well.

Veegie, source quads?? you think everything is modelled in quads and nothing else works?
I imagine the originals were nurbs and then transformed to triangle mesh. quads are not required for something to look good and it's not the source of the problem unless I'm mistaken. which is basically impossible.

the issue is still geometry precision due to 16bit coordinates and the reason it looks good in games and some editors is because of the vertex normals in the file which hides the actual geometry's uneven surface. you can think of it as game fakery. 
it might be possible to clean up the geometry with a fancy algorithm.

but that shouldn't be focused on for now. material and uv mapping first

In zmodeler 3d model is perfect. Except some troubles with badgings. But it's easy to fix. So at the moment we need texture converter and maybe save original materials in 3ds models.

That's fine with me .  Honestly, I don't think it will be very feasible to try and recover any lost precision through some elaborate algorithm that will only end up causing other problems.

Models render fine in 3ds max and other programs that do not recalculate normals.  The only reason Veegie and myself are even still discussing this topic is because when 3ds max exports to an intermediate mxs file for rendering in maxwell studios, it recalculates normals.  And maxwell studios is the preferred renderer because of its realism.  Unfortunately I will probably just end up writing a custom mxs exporter plugin for 3ds max to preserve the normals since maxwell's creators aren't exactly quick on bugfixes/additional feature requests...

Yeah, sorry about that.  It's caused by a difference in string cultures where compared to North America, Europe seems to swap commas with periods for numerical values.  Sommergemuese released a temporary fix earlier in the thread that you can use until I go back and fix it in my version...

Well all I have to say is thank you. You guys (Energien, Veegie, Sommergemuese and others) have made tremendous progress just to get the models out of Forza and into an editor, and to me the models are looking pretty good. (hope we will be able to get the tracks extracted too - when the time is there).

Thank you for your continuous efforts.

I used 3ds max with mental ray, I imported the .obj directly into max. It could be a result of my choosing to import certain pieces individually, the 'artifacts' appear where the meshes intersect. This render shows is more clearly:

What about downloading the Free 30 Day Demo from Autodesk.com and not using Pirated Versions?

3DS Max 2011 is the recent Version and working.

3DS Max 7 is not working. Don't ask me why, I think there is something wrong with the Forza Studio. We will see if this will be fixed

How do I download 3DS Max from the official site then?
Its downloads only the installer.exe and when starting it up,
it happens nothing.
And I use Firefox.

Successfully Converted Textures.

Problem is I can't offer you the unbundler which is needet for that.

No idea if it's possible with other tools...

Okay but you can't do much without this tool...

And sorry that I don't post a step by step Tutorial...

Howto:

Open one Texture you like with a Hex Editor.

Insert 60 Bytes at the beginning and Drop the Attached Header there.

Go to Offset 0x8 and Change the 6 Bytes to the Filesize WITH the 60 Extra Bytes. (It's in Big Endian.) This header has 16 00 70 = 1.441.904 Bytes. Important if you don't do that it will Crash.

Then go to Offset 0x20 and change the Texture Name to your liking.

Then UnBundler.exe texturename

It outputs all Mipmaps of the Texture.

So its possible to get the textures now  

My English is not that good to do them in right steps, but good find.

Looking again at the converted Ferrari texture I made the other week, I can see all the blue, but in those areas the alpha is 0, hence it was invisible. Are you saying the alpha is correct with your method of conversion?

Nope, incorrect no idea why, but thats for Shift Textures as well.

Saving them as PNG after Converting Solves the problem.

I could Image this Alpha is used for some Shading inside the Game maybe

Someone mentioned something about when you paint the car yourself getting a blank canvas, perhaps the alpha channel is used as a mask of some kind to the bits you can't paint over (like the ferrari logo, brake pads, fuel cap).

idk if anyone else has noticed (as I have yet to see anyone mention it), and I'm unsure to which process is causing it.. 
but every single vertex on these models are broken-
which is easily the cause for all the bad exports, chewed up meshes and misinterpreted smoothing I've seen associated with these tools

great work tho gentlemen, keep it up

I know .. I'm stupid

@ Varel 

First convert the TGA to PNG or what ever you like

Second not all cars have liverys 

Third: Use your favourite 3D App and assign the right textures on the right place

Thanks!  

Now it works. I was not able to import the .TGA to photoshop without the alpha channel already applied. Searching a conversion tool I discovered that the free utility DDS converter allows you to export directly to DDS without having to save as PNG.

can someone please answer Smoke's question about getting the mesh into Zm please..

and please address the issue that I raised about all of the verts being broken, 
because unless you're doing a straight conversion (no scratch work, no working doors, ect.), 
the broken vertices caused by F3RET are rendering these models pretty much useless :/

So I've taken a small break from my studies this weekend and did some major core changes to Forza Studio 

Currently I've integrated all of revelation's code into mine so it should be able to read any Forza 3 .carbin file now (let me know if you find out otherwise).  Each piece also now has its own index/vertex data that I rebuild after loading all of the sections which makes things much easier to work with.  Selective extraction should be working now too.  Also, I've added credits in the about section, so let me know if you would like to change how your name appears, or if you feel you should be added to the list...

I've made several bugfixes, and probably created several more because of all of these changes.  Most of them I am aware of, in the form of "todos" in the source code, and others I just didn't care to comment on.  Please let me know if you find anything drastically wrong with one of the main features mentioned above though...

I also would like to apologize for the seemingly slow progression, as I still have many things planned for this tool, I just haven't had the time to work on it as much as I'd like

great update Ernegien, selective export is very usefull  thanks for your work. the only problem i noted is that it cannot export textures coordinates, older version could 

how did u get it to zmod2 without screw mesh pawlo922?

I can Import FS OBJ>Max8>Export>Reset>Import Max8 OBJ and at least my max file will hold smoothing groups (Without the double import, the smoothing will get dropped-it will look faceted upon reopening the file).  Double import seems to jack up the normals though, (it looks like a FS OBJ imported without normals checked).  Not sure if this helps any.

BIG thanks, UV working perfect.

Edit:
Export for zmodeler
1. Open 3d max 2011 and import car
2. Delete texture from body.

3. Export for format opencollada (*.dae)
4. Open program 3d sim ed and import file *.dae
5. In 3d sim ed export for Rfactor (*.gmt)
6. Open zmodeler 2 and import gmt files.

The End

So maybe if models from Forza 3 are imports well, can you make support of Forza 2 carbin format. Engine of the game is similar to FM3. Fm2 have good models too.

I can provide you with some FM2 carmodels.

Yup, the Forza 2 .carbin formats are nearly identical to the lod 1-5 Forza 3 .carbin files, aside from small differences in the header and possibly in the vertex data as well.  Should be pretty easy to implement after I start work on it.  I've got a copy of Forza 1 around here somewhere as well, guess I can also put that on my list too, although I know for a fact that they are much different than Forza 2 or 3.

I have 3.1 and it's working.


@Ernegien

I have a small question: Is Forza Studio is not compatible with Max 9 or i am doing something wrong? (model looks great but after exporting to 3ds there is no UV)
Thanks for all your hard work guys!

Look in the bin/debug directory because I usually always release the compiled binaries with the source to match.  Eventually I'll include the xna redistributable and other documentation on its usage, but the main reason for me releasing these builds is so others can join in and help with the research.  I don't plan on providing too much support other than what's already stated in this thread, until I start debugging the builds and they become more finalized.

It could be that you are forgetting to select the checkbox that deals with textures during the import process into 3ds.  Otherwise, I have no clue, as there is still plenty to be figured out about textures.  Some UVs are bound within 1, while others are much larger.  Maybe there is a scale or something else that I haven't seen yet, but this is what has been figured out so far.

*Ernegien reaches thru the monitor and slaps Kot* lol- thx man, if it was a snake I'd be dead o.O
and I tested on xna 3.5 and got a "Mixed mode assembly is built against version'v2.0.507272' of the runtime 
and cannot be loaded in the 4.0 runtime without additional configuration information" error, so I take it you're using xna 2 then? lol

Just a update on that..  (Thank you for telling us users who have Zmodeler and cannot import .obj etc)

However this works but once exported from zmodeler converted into a game format and imported (Example: Test Drive Unlimited) The smoothing errors and pretty much everything falls apart once ingame.   

So ill have to wait for another way, or if Oleg (creator of zmodeler) could create a stable .obj format but I doubt he will.

↑ I would guess it's something to do with how these kats are reading/re-encoding the mesh.. 
there's something definitely off, because the 360 Shift DLC meshes Oleg's imports get phuckd off to and do odd things while editing them, 
not to mention entire parts completely disappear if you export the mesh to edit in Max... they also carry adverse effects once in game 
(unexplained game crashes, odd shadows, distorted mesh)- while normal pc indigenous/non-360 meshes do not :/

Well it looks like this...    


3 years modding TDU, I am 100% certain this car right now is the worst mod ive done. 

I think the problem is caused from 3dssimed exporting in Rfactor format, just to get the car smooth into Zmodeler. Cause I am then crossing formats over. 

I think these cars need a direct .obj filter for zmodeler in order to 100% work with smoothing.

Hey tool i did this and it worked for me, the only problem i had was when exporting the size of it was very big. It was 20,000 polys and the export size was 2mb. The problem that i have is that when i do it the way pawlo922 said, it breaks all the polys. Making them all have there own normals, which i think thats why its so big when exporting. Please tell me if i am doing some thing wrong.

Ah I found the issue, it was 3ds max importing fault.  

Anyways with 28,812 poly's I can get it about 1.90MB, however that that is with my default test car. Which is really nothing compared to the full working car.

Do you have a idea on how to make the export size smaller?

My ferrari F50 was 85,000 polys and the export was 2mb, but i fixed it by hand.


@Ernegien:Also will all porblems be fixed in future releases, such as normals. And also the rims dont seem to map the textures.

I'm well aware of both of these issues.  Normals really aren't a problem since they are correct to the pre-existing geometry that the developers used before importing the models into the game.  They render fine untouched, otherwise most modeling applications will recalculate normals from the vertex data that's left and end up producing inaccurate results.  Think of it as a math problem, where you have the answer, but very little work gets left behind to see how they came to that exact conclusion.  This is the issue we face currently with vertex precision and the normals, and backtracking may prove to be extremely difficult or even impossible to perfect...

As far as textures go, I'm sure they will be worked out eventually, but this application can be considered an early alpha release at best.  Again, I'm really only releasing this so others can join in on the research if they wish to speed things up, or so someone can pick up where I left off if I get preoccupied with other things and disappear for a while .  It is nowhere near finished, and there are still lots of unknowns that need to be figured out before I even bother officially supporting any of its features.  Unfortunately, I also can't guarantee that any of these problems will be fixed in future releases.  I'll try my hardest, but modeling and 3d applications really aren't my specialty, and this is all a learning experience for me...

On a side note, it's really great to see some of these models in other games

Yh, I understand its very hard to fix them.
Zmodeler2 should get an OBJ importer to get rid of the normals bugs.
Having them importing/exporting/importing/exporting is just confusing.
Im very unknown when about Autodesk.
I have installed 3DSMax 2011 and still got the messed up mesh I showed in previous
pages.
It didnt got even fixed with the compiled version by Sommergemeuse.

And yeah, great to see Forza3 models in many games.
Imagine Forza3 has 400 or 500 cars!

the rims included in the vehicle_lod0 meshes are mapped to the wheel/wheel_lol0 textures found in the wheel file specific to that vehicle

That's not even an issue with my application (the dialog is from something else).  I would suggest possibly increasing the size of your pagefile in your operating system to get more memory, or exit out of some unneeded applications or background processes to free some up as well.  Then there's always the more solid approach of getting more memory

I'm gonna regret asking this..   however I am tired and its 3:55am   

Anyways I recently had to reformat my PC (windows 7) which before I had to do that Forza tool worked, now with the reformat and install it won't work now. I do have Framework 3.5 etc, I did do a check before posting, so if it still turns out I don't then.. I am not gonna be happy.

do you read and reconstruct the polys by quad? or by tri? ..as I was wondering why the mesh has the same number of both, and why it deforms into a triangular mess when converting it to editable poly - it's frustrating that any type of editing to the mesh results in unrecoverable visible flaws (eg: converting it to editable poly, or for example, simply detaching a door from the body) - but the family and I definitely appreciate the time and effort you're continually putting into this project Ernegien, hopefully one day we'll be able to do more than just look at it 

edit- Threep managed to get an lod0 mesh in game (he had to use mesh smooth mind you which sent the lod0 count up drastically) - but look at the adaptive damage, look familiar? o.O
-there's something seriously and fundamentally wrong with these meshes- however, don't get me wrong, I'm not complaining.. as I'm trying to get Roman Lut to have a look at your source 
files and lend a hand with his input

it's no problem Ernegien, your work on this is epic, and if anyone has the knowledge and experience to help, it would definitely be him
I just sent him a Forza Studio created .obj file to assess as per his request (Mazda Furai_lod0), I figured that would be the best example
because of it's outrageous curvature - so we'll see what transpires..

I should mention 'Oleg' creator of Zmodeler is creating a .obj importer.  So those who use 3dsimed and other ways to get these excellent models into zmodeler will be possible soon without 3dssimed etc. 

He needs some help on it though, he wants to find out some things about the .obj format order for it to work, ive tried but I am not the best. 

Edit: Seems as though the zmodeler forums are down. Strange. When they come back on ill link.

Nah, won't be that.  Least I hope not.  

It just says:

So its either just a screw up on Zmodeler forum.

If thats true, MS is acting like a pussy.
They own a very huge amount of money.
And Forza 3 is only for Xbox360, so they get more money from
the damned Xcrap360.

And besides, Halo is getting more exclusive for Xcrap360.
So more and more money.
Atleast they can do us a favor for these models and textures
since PC only get a shit and piss.

So we should be very glad Energien atleast try to get the models
off and we exporting them to games we have on PC.

And Toolieo, glad Im not the only one with that Critical Error.
I thought it was my internet.

And another one, Oleg didnt even succeeded to release obj filter.
So thats no reason to shut his site up.

I have strange problem...

[Here](http://www.mediafire.com/?j2ft4gjtnmg) are two gmt's file, if open them in 3dsimed, you will see such model info:

cockpit_interior01.gmt (file with default Forza 3 UV)
Total Points(Vertices) = 66754
Total Faces = 25901

cockpit_interior02.gmt (without Forza 3 UV or remapped UV)
Total Points(Vertices) = 25257
Total Faces = 25901

maybe someone knows why that happens?

Wait? What..   They built the models orignally in 3dsmax?  That's pretty funny actually.

Of course they used 3ds Max.

Seeing the tremendous work achieved here on this forum, I decided to make sense of it all and try it out on a model myself. I have also tried to summarize what we’ve established in the last 29 pages of this thread. (Or rather, a collaboration of what I’ve found in this thread useful)

Unzipping the ZIP file
What you need:
QuickBMS, written by Luigi Auriemma (to open up the “cryptic” ZIP file, as Dan put it) | Thanks to “Ernegien”
[http://aluigi.org/papers/quickbms.zip](http://aluigi.org/papers/quickbms.zip)
The script (for the program above) used to extract the XBOX 360 archives (the program should ask you to select this file before extraction)
[http://aluigi.org/papers/bms/zip.bms](http://aluigi.org/papers/bms/zip.bms)

Source:
[viewtopic.php?f=10&t=4256&st=0&sk=t&sd=a](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=4256&st=0&sk=t&sd=a)

1)	Open up the program, and it should automatically ask you for the script file.
2)	Select that script file, and it should then ask you for the file you want to extract. In this case, select the extracted ZIP file.
3)	It should then prompt you where you want to extract the files. Make a nice folder to extract everything into. You should end up with a folder consisting of bits and bobs.


I have used the Range Rover as an example, as shown above.

Extracting the Model
What you need:
Forza Studio (used to open up the model files) | Big thanks to “Ernegien” for creating the program in the first place 
Forza Studio (5.2.10)
[viewtopic.php?f=10&t=4256&st=0&sk=t&sd=a&start=375](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=4256&st=0&sk=t&sd=a&start=375)
Forza Studio (5.3.10)
[viewtopic.php?f=10&t=4256&p=37847&hilit ... dio#p37847](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=4256&p=37847&hilit=Forza+Studio#p37847)
Forza Studio (5.10.10)
[viewtopic.php?f=10&t=4256&p=38063&hilit ... dio#p38063](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=4256&p=38063&hilit=Forza+Studio#p38063)
.NET Framework 2.0 (to run the above program)
XNA Framework 3.1 (once again, to run Forza Studio)
[http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/deta ... laylang=en](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=53867a2a-e249-4560-8011-98eb3e799ef2&displaylang=en)

Theory:
In the folder of files you have extracted from the previously forementioned ZIP file, the .carbin file(s?) contain the 3D models.

1)	Install the necessary programs listed above for Forza Studio to function properly.
2)	Open Forza Studio, and open up either the file name similar to the ZIP folder name (i.e. in my case lr_rangerover_08.carbin) – lr_rangerover_08_lod0.carbin is the one that only contains the exterior; if you want the interior separate from the exterior, then open that one instead and export | to get the interior, open up the _cockpit.carbin 
3)	It should then load up the models on the left panel, and display what the selected models on the panel on the right.



4)	According to “TomWin”, source: [viewtopic.php?f=10&t=4256&p=37808&hilit=lod1#p37808](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=4256&p=37808&hilit=lod1#p37808) it seems to be better to use the lod1 model instead of the others. (lod1 to lod5 is the amount of detail you want in the model; source: [viewtopic.php?p=37245#p37245](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?p=37245#p37245) ) Untick the parts of the model that you want to export.
5)	Export the bits you want by right clicking on lod1 (or the model you’ve selected to take parts off) and selecting “Selective export”. It should then spurt out an .obj file.

That’s great. Now we have the model exported. What on earth do we do with it now?

The way I see this, you can either do it with the hex editor (which I haven’t tried yet), or use the converter for another game.

1)	Download the converter (if you’re using that method), save it somewhere
2)	Drag the file named nodamage_lod0.xds onto the program itself and it should export the file as a tga.

Guess we need to wait for a direct .obj import filter then. Anything else I've missed out?

Ignore below.
Question - sommergemuese, when I try to import the .dae file into 3dSim Demo, no model shows up at all. I've followed all the import/export options in 3DS Max 2011 and it still doesn't import anything in 3dSim.

@playah- using that double and triple I/O garbage is useless.. those methods are simply the voice of ...idkwtf
(open collada/dae/3dsimed/doing a rain dance while clicking your heels together and saying there's no place like duh)

directly import the Forza Studio created lod1.obj and cockpit.obj into Max, delete all the a_pillar and shared lod0 body parts,
select all> convert to editable poly> apply meshsmooth modifier (modifier drop down) iterations = 0 > collapse stack

you are now free to edit the mesh and/or export to 3ds (or any other format you want for any other 3d application)

sorry, but the lod0 meshes are not viable ..unless left untouched (editable mesh) and used for rendering purposes-
given the circumstances, optimally, one would use the lod1 model with HQ cockpit, then substituting lod1 details for lod0 (lights, wipers, hood pins/latches, ect. ect.)
and using the same aforementioned method (editable mesh>editable poly>meshsmooth 0> collapse) on all the detailed lod0 parts you integrate-

You dont need to take ways using open collada, 3DSimED, and other stuffs..

just import the mesh, and when the OBJ import dialogue shows up, untick "smoothing groups"
export to 3DS
import in ZModeler1
saev
open in ZModeler2

there's far too many possible causes for me to accurately say why

edit- btw Ernegien, Roman didn't seem interested in lookn at the source, all he did was dissect the .obj and give the same conclusion we already know
(your excerpt about FM3 files lacking the appropriate smoothing data so smoothing is forced into per vert params) - I couldn't convince him to eval the source, sry

For you, its easy.
But I dont like and dont work with 3DS Max 
Come on, you expect everyone is stupid?
And they got brain surgery?


Ontopic,
Sorry, I dont like this kinda people, thinking people are stupid and got brain surgery.
No one is perfect.


I have respect for you Energien, now already made .zip files import!
Its getting alot better!
Keep it the good work man!  

And ow, I have looked into the carbin files and found some
interesting words like "black, leather, chrome, tire, window, glassRM, headlightL" and some other.
Maybe its not interesting, but could be they are the material names?
And they are like copied 2 times, so they have these model seperated in
each part.
But I gues you already figured them out.
i only wants to try to help

lol- "it's not brain surgery" means you don't have to be a flippn genius doctor brain surgeon to figure the sheet out..

but if you're too got damn lazy to google "3dsmax material tutorial" and spend 3 minutes learning how to do it, then yes, you're STUPID
of all the things to learn in Max, creating materials is by far one of the less daunting tasks- so there's no excuse for you..
but hey, you don't like Max.. so instead of learning, why don't you ask Ernegien to create other export formats just for YOU (ass)

btw, every single part of the model has the material name within the part name itself (eg; some_some_carbonfiber_some)
but if you're using that completely worthless method of double and triple I/O, I guess you wouldn't kno that would you-
and about the double maps, you did read the names of them yes? the ones that have "lod0" in the name are for the..

now you guess

don't expect a response from me to any of your irrelevant blathering or mental diarrhea after this post

(...) you man, cant you just talk niceley instead like that?
Calling me stupid because I dont want to work with 3DS Max is useless.
I just DONT WANT to with 3DS Max, wtf is that wrong???
I had learned how to use 3DS Max some few years ago.
It was not much of a problem but I had no time to use it.

You lack some manners eh?
Aw, how cute...

I will not gonna reply to you in the future because talking with you makes me sorry
and its tottaly worthless.
I only said I dont like and dont work with 3ds max and you freak the fuck out and attacking
with your tiny balls and  fake sword...

So from now, no OFFTOPIC and crap like this.
Be ontopic or GTFO, I dont want posts like this and especially in this populair thread.
Live and let live.

@BigBear: Kot meant that its not a big job to pull new mats around the mesh. I use ZModeler2, and I finish it in around 15-20 minutes (@Kot: material names are not in there anymore, after 3ds export, you get nam0001 and so on)

also, if I may ask, I noticed that the leather part's mapping is gone when I open them in ZMod2. Guys, anyone has leather mapping in Max/any other apps?

Would it be too much/too hard work to program in the  creation of a .MTL file on export of .OBJ as that would make applying materials a lot faster. The MTL file is basically just the surfaces info but stored on an external text file rather than within the object itself.

Heres an Example of a basic material file which has 3 surfaces.  [.MTL](http://pastebin.com/wbSmHTLX)

This is what each line means...

newmtl Diffuse_material  ....  newmtl = Create new surface. Diffuse_Material = Just the name of the surface, can be anything you like
Ka 0.501961 0.501961 0.498039... Ka = Ambient . Value between 0 and 1 to represent 0-100
Kd 0 0 1  ..   Kd = Diffuse . Value between 0 and 1 to represent 0-255 for the RGB values
Ks 1 1 1  ..   Ks = Specular . Value between 0 and 1 to represent 0-255 for the RGB values
illum 2 .. Not sure about this. I adjusted it to 4,6 and 10 and it didn't seem to change anything in deep exploration
Ns 8  ..  Ns = Glossiness . This is an odd one.. In Deep Ex, if i set a value of 20 the mat shows it as 8, if i set it as 40, the mat shows it as 32, if i set it as 50 the mat shows it as 64, and finally if i set it as 100 the mat shows it as 2048. Im sure someone knows how that value is being calculated.
map_Kd Test\\TB2.jpg  = Diffuse image map location/name
map_bump  = bump image map location/name
bump  This is always set the same as map_bump when you use a bump map
map_opacity  = Opacity map image location/name
map_d  = Another opacity map image location/name. This one will override the map_opacity setting
refl  = Reflection map image location/name
map_kS  = Specular/highlight map image location/name
map_kA  = Ambient map image location/name
map_Ns  = Glossyness map image location/name

While all that is fine and dandy, it doesn't need to be anywhere near as complex for what we need. Heres another quick snippet from another .Mtl file ( taken form a model of a lego man of all things )

newmtl Red
Kd 0.65 0.10 0.10

newmtl Orange
Kd 1.00 0.50 0.20

newmtl Green
Kd 0.10 0.40 0.10

newmtl LightGreen
Kd 0.30 0.60 0.30

newmtl Blue
Kd 0.00 0.20 0.70

All that is doing is adding a surface for each part and only assigning a colour value to it. And thats pretty much all we need in the mtl file, as that will, give us the model with basic surfaces . we can then either just set a colour value or assign one of the cars images to that surface.
I'm not sure how you would make the exporter know what each surface is, maybe look for common names in the object parts such as Body or Chrome etc..? or it might be stored in the model itself ( a lot of 3d model formats do that .)

You exported the car to .3ds?
If yes, .3ds formats are one big holy cow crap.
.3ds fks up the mesh when exporting/importing, the axis gets fk up too.
Wait for an obj importer for Zmodeler2.

Glad to help, the sooner mtl is included the better for me, so i had good incentive to poke around   

Something else i noticed the other day while poking around with one of the car objects, i'm not sure if you / others are aware of it. The exported obj's are containing rather a lot of "non-planar" 2 point polygons. which will act as hard edges in the model and could ( and often do ) mess up smoothing. The image below is from one of the aston martins. imported as the original Obj, and converted to 3DS and imported ( both into lightwave 3d ) i have also tried it with another car ( shelby ) and converted the obj directly to LWO ( lightwave format ) and that also contains a ton of the same 2 point polygons..

As they are present in the obj, it would suggest something is " a bit wonky" in your exporter, or the way it reads the vertex information. Its probably just rereading a few vertex entries, but only 2 not 3 (which would make a normal triangle). Because they are only 2point polygons you cannot see them as rendered items but they are still there, acting as hard edges and having one ,say... running diagonal across a door ( which they have ) can make it think it has a sharp crease and show bad smoothing . I dunno how easy it is for you to check, but have a look see if when its reading in a model, is it looking at some vertex twice. IMO that is probably whats happening.

BTW lol sorry almost forgot to say. theres an easy way to get rid of them, load the model into your modeling app of choice, then (depends how your modeler works will depends how you do this ) but you basically want to select ALL " Non-Planar " polygons then delete them. Ive check after deleting them and no other polygons were deleted (none from the actual model) Which as the non planars were "spare" polygons ( not part of the actual model ) that would also suggest that FS is rereading some vertex data. While deleting all these polygons will help a fair amount with the smoothing it doesn't seem to fix all of it, altho id imagine a lot of that with fix itself when parts start to get merged together to form bigger parts ( such as all the parts of a door being merged/welded together to form a complete door) that often fixes a lot of edge smoothing. Also as these polygons are not part of the actual model, deleting them will not harm the UV co-ordinates at all.

Is this a possible chance why file size is also high? Cause even on the most simple LOD 1 etc the file size is pretty high, LOD1 models are close to NFS Shift car poly counts and its far too high.


Just gotta learn how to do that in 3ds max now..

What's wrong  
That pic alread explained and you dont know?

The model you try to import has more vertices than it's allowed.
You reached the limit of max allowed vertices.

You don't help anything, no you even read NOTHING here just ask all things 1000 times in a row... again and again.

Sorry if you can't assign simple textures to a model you should first learn how 3ds max or whatever you using works and please stop asking these dumb ass questions

Hi toolio (i know you better as tool831) Yes thats a very good reason why the file sizes are bigger, well 2 reasons really but THAT is the main one.. If you think about it, you getting more polygons than you need. i looked at the first car in the list last night, its an ACU_15_ARX01b_08. In the lod1 of the body its made up of about 30,000ish polygons and there is an extra 4000 non planar 2 point polygons ( thats just in the bodywork. you still have the interior ( which also has non planar's) as well as the other objects. so yeah they are all being made slightly bigger than they should be. The second reason, you should notice this one as you save and reload the object into ( max did you say? )  as we all know most of the body parts are on separate layers ( such as the wheel arch is separate to the front wing) etc.  once you start joining those parts together together, so you end up with a more complete solid body  as you join those parts the end rows of each part joins ( kinda obvious ) which also optimizes the model because those end rows of polygons, each have points so when you merge those points together it removes half of them because two becomes one when  you merge.
( i hope that last bit about merging parts made sense, i was aware i was rambling slightly   )

In regards on how to do it in max. i really don't have a clue , i only have max as a converter for Max files and 3dripper files. i do all my stuff in lightwave. you might have something similar to what we have.  i called up a polygon stats window, it basically just shows how many 3 point poly's, 4 point ,>4 point and non planar, from that i can just select all the non planar and delete them, im sure max must have some way of selecting non planar polygons... sounds silly, but have you tried the help manual ?

@Nobby:  (Won't quote too much   )  Yeah I understood about merging etc, I did decide to get Lightwave now. Seeing you have said you have it easier now I must say getting rid of all those.  

Hopefully Ernegien can make the forza studio not have non-Planar polys etc, would be easy for most.

Sorry for going offtopic again. You probably should update the first post so these newbies' questions wouldn't be asked anymore.

my way of importing to ZM: 
import to MAX (@OBJ import dialogue, untick the "OBJ Smoothing Groups) option
export to 2DS
import to ZModeler 1.0.7
save as Z3D
open in ZModeler 2, and start working (this actually works with even unregistered versions of ZModeler2)

so far, it worked on ALL meshes.

again, sorry for going off topic.

Also, is it just me, or anyone else noticed some flipped polygons after importing?

Exported as Open Collada Imported into Max and now I can convert to Editable Poly and play around without any Errors.

Look I "played" and all is right:

Hi, sorry for my newbie question but I understood all the procedure except from one thing. How you can see the content of the XBOX's DVD?

So far I was working with the files available here in this thread. Yesterday I went to loan the DVD of Forza3 and took it to a friend of mine so he copy it into an image file and write in my USB stick. When I got home, I copy it in my pc and tried to open the iso file with DTools. The iso file is about 7GB but in the DVD content there is VIDEO_TS and AUDIO_TS empty folders and another one folder of 90MB.

Thank you in advance.

1] using Daemon Tools, mount Forza 3's disc1
2] run Xbox Backup Creator and in the drop down, choose the mounted image
3] tab over to Image Tools and choose Image Browser to access the disc
4] nav to Media + Cars to access the vehicles (right click zip file + extract)
5] run QuickBMS and follow the prompted instructions to extract the zip contents
6] run Forza Studio and open desired .carbin file(s) - right click on node + export
7] run 3ds Max, import .obj file(s) with recalculate normals and smoothing groups unticked

Okay after Cleanup I got exactly 2 (not more) Normal Errors which can be fixed in 3DS Max within seconds.

After that you have a perfect Model

Retry. Re-extract the file and try it open. The only tool i know is that XTX converted, and for me, it worked. 
For the materials, you have to make all.

If you still happen to have problems with the textures, send them through a PM, and i'll see if it works for me

You answered your own question about converting the xds with XTX converter.

But, reading the whole topic might be a good idea.
Thats the way you dont miss anything.
And you could find this:
[viewtopic.php?p=38184#p38184](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?p=38184#p38184)
with all the needs you want.
Good luck.

And getting the materials on the cars requires knowledge about 3D editing programs.
Thats too much to explain, I suggest you to google.
There are several 3D editing programs like Zmodeler series, 3D studio max, Maya, Gmax
Milkshape, Deep Exploration and etc.

@BigBear: he had troubles with XTX do DDS

@430scud: every part is separated to materials. All mats are deleted, but if you check it, the front bumper is in like 8 parts. Those are on 8 different materials that you have to make up. Most commons are glass, glass black, body, shared maps (chassis, underbody,...), interior, lights,... assign the textures to all, then assign the materials to the meshes

Also, if I wouldn't be disturbing, I'd like to suggest two things:

-separate export all: save every files separately (LOD0,LOD1,LOD2,LOD3,cockpit,...)
-export the textures with them to XDS (so you wouldn't have to use quickBMS at all)

Hello
Thank you for both answers.
I rather have problems with the converter: xds to tga.
Some of them are succesfully converted but the nodamage_lod0.xds and some other aren't.
I really don't know why it won't convert the other files , I need.

i noticed if you try converting multiple xds files at once it fails on the conversion, also, if you have it set so you can just click on the files and they run the converter automatically... If you have that setup and you click too many files too fast then again it will fail. only way i found to get every file to convert is to click each one, separately, wait for the converter to open then close THEN move onto the next. it seems to just not like multiple files at once.

Just write a batch file like this:

```
NFS_Shift_XTX_TO_TGA.exe -1562566258284435386.xtx
NFS_Shift_XTX_TO_TGA.exe -2043234478802056979.xtx
NFS_Shift_XTX_TO_TGA.exe -263645799408748939.xtx
NFS_Shift_XTX_TO_TGA.exe -288842375798847400.xtx
NFS_Shift_XTX_TO_TGA.exe -3116409635261905151.xtx
...

```


You can get a list of your files with a simple command line command. Navigate in a command shell to your texture dir, and type in following command:
dir *.xtx /B > list.txt
If you need a wait time between each picture, use two lines between each command:
@ping 127.0.0.1 -n 2 -w 1000 > nul
@ping 127.0.0.1 -n %1% -w 1000> nul

It lists all XTX files (*.xtx |or whichever you decide to|), it does not show any additional info (/B) and writes it into a new list.txt ( > list.txt). Then open the txt, add the exe in front of every line, save it as whatever.bat and simply double click it.

Hi Ernegien,
I am excited with the Forza Studio. I would like to export some cars from Forza Motorsport 3,
and I know Forza Studio is the best program or I should say it's the only program to convert cars models!
Anyway, I got a problem, a big trouble about the program.
I've tried my best but I couldnt have any solution.

Well, required programs like  Microsoft XNA Game Studio, Microsoft XNA Framework and Microsoft .Net Framework is installed.
Installed Programs are shown in pics:
[](http://i.imagehost.org/view/0917/InstalledProgram)[](http://a.imagehost.org/view/0245/InstalledProgram2)

In addition, Forza Studio Program is placed in C Drive location
[](http://a.imagehost.org/view/0536/FozaStudio)

The problem is here, actually i have all of the require programs installed, but when I run ForzaStudio.exe, it gives me such a problem.
[](http://j.imagehost.org/view/0438/Error)


i dunno why,i really annoyed with that. i hope someone who can help me!
Thanks in advance 
i am sorry if the pics are too large in pixel.
PS. It is the newest version of Forza Studio

Yeah KaLaC, I'm well aware of the issue as I've got someone else that seems to have the same problem as well.  I haven't really had much time to look into it, but it probably has something to do with my assumptions on the english language.  Below is my current progress, and it should dump an error.txt file to the application directory if an unhandled exception gets thrown.  Please paste that information (hopefully it's in English ) back here and I'll see if I can fix the problem later...

It will be in the bin directory, where the application resides, unless you've moved it elsewhere...

> Hi Ernegien,
I am excited with the Forza Studio. I would like to export some cars from Forza Motorsport 3,
and I know Forza Studio is the best program or I should say it's the only program to convert cars models!
Anyway, I got a problem, a big trouble about the program.
I've tried my best but I couldnt have any solution.

Well, required programs like  Microsoft XNA Game Studio, Microsoft XNA Framework and Microsoft .Net Framework is installed.


The problem is here, actually i have all of the require programs installed, but when I run ForzaStudio.exe, it gives me such a problem.



i dunno why,i really annoyed with that. i hope someone who can help me!
Thanks in advance 
i am sorry if the pics are too large in pixel.
PS. It is the newest version of Forza Studio

Can you translate the error into English?
Its hard to read Japanese/Korean/Chinese

Yeah, unfortunately those error messages really don't give me a lot of information to work with.  If the .NET framework is offered in different languages (which it should be), I would definitely advise you to download the English version...

yeah....  
I'm getting an error like KaLaC too.
After all I've been using the .NET Framework 2.0 and .NET Framework 2.0 were the same as English.

Japanes:[http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/deta ... laylang=JA](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=0856eacb-4362-4b0d-8edd-aab15c5e04f5&displaylang=JA)

What I think the language problem.
I hope to fix these bugs to developers.
or .NET Framework 4 will be able to use or support.
Please fix it ! I want to use Forza Studio
Thanks

You should make a thread about your problem with opening DVD contents.
This thread is for research and not for asking for media contents.

The most recent source already includes code to completely parse through Forza 2 carbin files, I just haven't gotten around to looking into how the subpart indices reference the two chunks of vertex data...

Hi Ernegien,

Forza Studio is coming along leaps and bounds. I had some initial noob problems but soon got over those. Everything is now working well butI have a request and I think it would be a five second fix for you (based on how quickly you rattled out the initial versions!)

.MTL files!!

I've attached a file that shows how an OBJ with MTL associated with it is different to the current OBJ.

In essence rather than it list:-
V entries
VT entries
VN entries
G (group?) reference line which lists the part name.
F entries for that part
G New part name
F entries ........ and so on.

you now get:-

mtllib material.mtl (reference the mtl file to be used)
G part name
V entries for just that part
VT entries for just that part
VN enries for just that part
usemtl materialname (taken from the MTL file)
F entries for just that part
G group (for next part)...... and the list continues as before........

The MTL file needs to just list
newmtl NAME (should be taken from the G part references)
Kd 1 1 1 (just sets the diffuse colour to white - can be this for everything)

I figured if you scanned the list of G references in your OBJ you could create an MTL and then (re)write the OBJ in the new order.

This would be amazing if you can add it in as for us 'renderers' out there its the icing on the cake to speed up conversion.

Let me know if you need any more info on MTL or OBJ structure but I think its all covered in the attachement.

Fingers crossed!

As long as the .mtl file is in the same directory as the .obj, the following import settings will have you covered.


Have fun!

Nice one Ernegien,

Many thanks for this.    

EDIT: just spotted a minor thing.

Can you change the export line for the next update to:-

// export faces
sw.WriteLine("usemtl {0}", piece.Parent.Name + "_" + piece.Name); - I think this is right but i'm not an Xna developer!   

and I guess the MTL export bit will need tweaking as well. If we put the part name before the surface name it will help when bringing the cockpit and car models together. because we have some matching surfaces, there can sometimes be an issue as to which one gets to stay!

and we want to use Forza Studio ><
Thanks

It's definitely something your end, there is nothing wrong with forza studio. it is working fine and as expected, complete with mtl files being created. If it was so full of bugs,  nobody would be able to use it

is there a way to convert the mesh to editable poly without using the open collada and 3dsimed?

Because i'm using max 2011 and open collada doesn't go with max 2011.

And the use of the textures is a still a bit confusing to me, yes i know how to use textures but the material editor in max is full and i'm still going by trial and error.

Just apply an editable poly modifier rather than converting it.
Can we please keep all discussion of "bring it to this app, then export it to this app, then import it to this app" out of here?
Remember, this topic is for fundamental research of the .carbin file format.

I think getting a piece of useable LOD0 mesh actually is topic-related.

maybe try ZModeler2->GTA4 WFT->MAX GTA4 import filter.

in GTA4, every mesh looks fine for me.

We already can use LOD0. its only people,that insist on using max ( possibly other autodesk products ) that have to do this editable poly mesh business. the models load in perfectly fine in most other apps. and you can edit them right away without having to do anything special to them.
 So as veegie said can we keep " app specific issues" to other threads and keep this one for just the carbin files..

But the problems are only with Forza 3 Files... copy?

So here is the right place to discuss these problems because it's researching Forza 3 files too

Since I have never seen this kind of deformation in 3D Studio MAX besides Forza's meshes, I think it should somehow be related to... hmm. I don't really know. Do you think it might be related to Forza3 meshes?

And, since the thread was created to export Forza3 meshes, I think this should probably be the right place to discuss the methods of working with LOD0 forza meshes.

And, since the LOD0 models contain some tiny chamfers, so tiny, that most 3D app recognises those polies as simple lines, that probably cause the error mentioned, and probably a member could find a script or something to fix it

Well i've been exploring a bit.

The max issue ain't normals and ain't smoothing... 

The wierd thing is when i run optimize on the editable poly mesh most of that reflection issue just dissapears. gonna look more into it.

BTW how do I rip the cars from the 2 DVD. and also DLC would be nice.

Furthermore, if they were using max to model the originals (as shown from an earlier post), why does max have issues?  I was looking at the LOD0_cockpit for the Nissan Versa recently, specifically at the windshield glass.  It appears that possibly some of the polygons have the vertices read in a different order causing edges to be rotated.  Easier to look at a pic.[](http://img227.imageshack.us/i/versascreen.jpg/)

So If I was modeling something symmetric I would make half and mirror.  From the angle of the diagonals, it seems to me the modeler used a symmetry modifier on this object.  BUT there are diagonals (marked in red) that are not symmetric to the other side.  There are spots on other meshes where the diagonals seem rotated for no apparent reason.  Perhaps this is what is causing the wonky faces?

Why is LOD0 important:
[http://developer.nvidia.com/object/melody_home.html](http://developer.nvidia.com/object/melody_home.html)

Just a thought.

:/  I see lod1-5 has some edge rotation so maybe not.

Now that i look at it... the poly placement on the upper left corner look perfect to make a round corner but the "path" it takes is wierd.

I'll explain.



If you follow 1-2-3-4 you get the round normal corner. but the edges seem to follow 2-1-3-4, wich makes it do that wierd "wrong positioned" verts.

in response to " those red lines" perhaps those could be the Non planar 2 point polygons i mentioned several pages back, there are Thousands of polygons that are not actually part of the model present in every object, in most of the main body models (not meaning the cockpit) there are around 4000 polygons that do not belong there. They are also present in the cockpit, rotor and caliper models too.

See this post i made .. [viewtopic.php?p=38301#p38301](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?p=38301#p38301) They could be what those red lines are in your model.

- Post Title: Re: Forza Motorsport Resource Extraction (.carbin)

Honestly that doesn't make any sense to me.  All my tool does is build a simple trinagle list and extract exactly as such, a list of triangles (3-point faces).  The idea of there being a "2-point polygon" is really an oxymoron and quite rediculous to believe in, unless you really mean a 3-point polygon in which two points share the same coordinates.  Also, 3-point polygons will always share the same plane by definition, so I'm not sure what removing non-planar polygons achieves, because there shouldn't ever be any, unless from the special case described above with shared verts.  Regardless, I don't even think the obj format supports points or lines, just faces.  Since I by no means consider myself to be an expert in this area, please correct me if I am wrong, but these concepts seem fairly trivial upon first inspection and I find it extremely hard to believe otherwise...

EDIT: I've just confirmed that there is something wrong with the export process, as there are lots of faces that have duplicate points, whoops... 

EDIT2: Meh, I don't know what to think anymore.  I can easily modify my app to not dump faces with duplicate vertices, but it seems that the problem originates elsewhere.  In the image below, is a segment of the index data.  As you can see, if treating it as a triangle strip (which my app does), it will produce duplicate verts per face.

f1 100, 101, 102
f2 101, 102, 101 <-- dup 101's
f3 102, 101, 103
f4 101, 103, 101 <-- dup 101's again
.....



Then I thought that maybe I should be treating the index data as a list of quads instead, but the image below proves otherwise since it shows an odd number of indices in some of the strips.  There are also pieces with only 3 indices per strip so I really don't see how it can be considered anything else other than a triangle strip.



The only conclusions I can come to at the moment are that their .carbin tool is messed up and exports this duplicate information, or that they use a combination of quads and tris in each strip, possibly starting out with quads and ending with a tri if necessary.  Using duplicate verts for a quad will emulate a tri, so it could very well be quad strips.  Then in the case of only 3 or odd indices per strip, the gpu might see the delimiter and recognize that it can't render a quad, and will render a tri instead.  I will test this theory later, but I somehow doubt it is what they are doing...

Any ideas? :X

I'm not really sure the issue is this, because in the sentra's windshield one side is fine while the other messes up.

and by figuring they use a symmetry modifier they both should be equal, so I would bet it's a problem of reading order (I dunno if it makes any sense).

Like the image i posted, while getting the points of the corner to make the tris it seems to jump right to point 2 instead of going to 1 first.

this could be because when you create the meshes from the striped data you've caught the "wrong poly" sometimes, usually in small details where they're more clustered.

Hi Guys,

I had a quick look over these non planar polys (which are all 3 point BTW).

as you can see, from the body of the 69 Charger,



There are 14129 nonplanars, and they cover most of the surfaces the object has.

Putting in a sanity check to remove duped tris (or rather tris with two vertices in the same place) would be a good move to reducing overall model size. 

I was wondering what these extras could be. I can't remember if Forza3 shows actual car geometry damage as well as texture damage but could it be something to do with where the car buckles on impact or maybe to do with collision detection in general. either way, removing them doesnt seem to hurt the model.

For every car, In the Physics folder inside the f-zip there is a Maxdata.xml.  This is a list of collision spheres that I assume is used for deformation.  rFactor uses spheres for damage deformation. I would think Forza uses the same type of system.  Accepted methods and practices usually transcend platforms.

I wish I could be of more help.  Strips, Fans, Quads, Tris, all get my head spinning.  Back in the day I remember reading about some format that read the last entry of "a strip/fan" in reverse to signify the end of that group, perhaps this is doing something like that?  It may have been the DXF format?  Maybe that was a custom game format [papy 3do]?  It was like 10 years ago, all pretty foggy now.

Hi Lordpantsington (wicked name BTW)

i agree, most systems use a collision sphere or bounding box approach for speed of calculation. I have known a few systems use a proxy model approach and I wondered if this was one of those. 

Its really not a problem. If the dupes are just removed from the build up list it should thin the poly count, reduce the model filesize and save cleanup time.

Removing degenerate triangles would seem like a good idea. Just ensure index0 != index1 && index1 != index2 and only output the triangle if that holds true. The strip restart is useful where you want to jump to a completely different part of the mesh, but a degenerate triangle can be slightly more efficient if you're going to use at least 1 of the recent indices, so perhaps that's why they did it.

also, until that happens, ZModeler2 users can remove non-planar poligons by using the modify-submesh-cleanup tool

Degenerate triangles they are...thanks for the tip.  I remember you mentioning them before, I had just forgotten about them

Its annoying to read the capital letters.

And second, read some few pages back and you'll find the answers.
Or better, read the whole thread!

thanks for all the hard work getting these tools to work with forza 3,im in the process of converting a few cars for gtr2,using 3ds max and 3dsimed,are the lod0 models usuable??  ive read so many conflicting views throughout this thread,im now confused. 
 Ive gotten the car al prepeared ,sized,textured ect (using lod0 carbin in forza studio,exported,int max+then simed)
  Now ive hit a barrier,when trying to save the models as gtr2 format,ie chassis for instance,used the relevant parts +exploded to make 1 chassis gmt model,i get error to many vertices,could anyone point me in the right direction to overcome this,i have tried my hardest to sort this issue myself,as ive seen a few people being flamed here for not having as much knowledge as lets say the people who using 3d apps ie-3ds max ect daily,ive also tried using the lod1 model,but man theres a vast difference in quality compared to the lod0, the particular model im messing with at the moment has quite large gaps around the doors bonnet,trunk ect using lod1,i think itll look pretty poor in game.
hope someone willing to give me a little guidance

For importing into other games, I would suggest using the LOD1 or even LOD2 which are lower quality than LOD0, but contain a lot less vertices...

Yes, I agree lod0 are too high detailed for other games.
But for other games like GTA series are no problem 
They caan handle them good.
My GTA SA can handle max 8 milion polies without problems.

Zmodeler2 has obj import/export.
Maybe you guys should import the obj into Zmodeler2 and export to obj
to import in 3ds max?
Or export them to .3ds from Zmodeler2 and import into 3ds max?

@Ernegien, what about Grand Turismo 5 (Prologue)? 
They seems to have alot greater meshes and around 1000 cars.
But the game is not out yet.
Anyway, your tool has made the possibilities for exporting Forza 3 cars
to other games.
Thats the greatest tool ever for Forza!

This should remove about 15k degenerate triangles per LOD0 mesh, but the vertex count will still remain the same.  Vertex counts are really the only difference between the LODs, so if you want to reduce the vertex count you would just get something similar to a LOD1 or LOD2 model.  What I might try doing is combining LOD0 model parts with LOD1, mixing and matching between the two.  Try opening up the car zip of your choice, selecting everything in LOD1, deslecting its body->body subpart, then checking the body->body subpart in the LOD0 mesh and do a selective export on everything.  When I tried it It gave me a reasonable amount of vertices...

Forza Studio (5.29.10)

thanks for this software,your enthusiasm is second to none in the goal to improve on your already fantastic software,yeah ive been mixing + matching the lod0 and lod1,but you will i think agree,cockpit detail is vital in a racing sim,and i think the nfs shift cockpits are more detailed than these forza 3 cockpits,and they are no trouble to import/export from 3d apps without exceeding the vertices limit,but also in gtr2 the exterior car model must fit in with the numerous detailed cars which have made there way to this platform  from newer games, ie shift xbox dlc cars ect.
but hey i know somethings are just not possible
thanks Ernegien   keep up the great work

So maybe you picked up the wrong texture.

Lights Texture:

there are 3 lights textures.
1 is in the shared files (I never actually saw any mesh mapped to that)
1 for LOD1-LOD5 models (lights.xds)
1 for LOD0 models (lights_lod0.xds)

use the proper one.

@Ernegien: I don't know if you could or want to, though is it possible in your Forza tool inside 'About' you could list what version it is? Cause I am starting to get lost in what forza tool is the latest and old.  

Forza Studio (5.29.10) I know now is the latest but I think I had 5.19 still.

I don't believe in running around like some limp wristed overly sensitive "politically correct" pretentious tard just to protect the feelings of others
I tell it like it is, plain and simple.. if someone is too female to hear how lousy they're doing, then don't bring it into public view -period-
and trust Simon, my social skills pwn every single person you've met, and will ever meet ..and this is simply because I get paid for them
sides, how boring would this world be if there were no shit talkers, if there were nobody to challenge or call out? *yawn 

here, lemme use a relevant parable;

"What you lookin' at? You all a bunch of fuckin' assholes. You know why? You don't have the guts to be what you wanna be! You need people like me. 
You need people like me so you can point your fuckin' fingers and say, "That's the bad guy." So... what that make you? Good? You're not good. 
You just know how to hide, how to lie. Me, I don't have that problem. Me, I always tell the truth. Even when I lie. So say good night to the bad guy! 
Come on. The last time you gonna see a bad guy like this again, let me tell you. Come on. Make way for the bad guy. There's a bad guy comin' through! 
Better get outta his way!" 

again, sorry about the offtop.. but I can't just sit here and let ignorance in the guise of wisdom prevail

I can guarantee you that I am better than you in a lot of things (as well as you being better than me or others at other things), yet that doesnt make it right for me to go out of my way and call you out on your weaknesses. The fact of the matter is that everyone has their strengths and weaknesses with plenty of room for improvement.  I myself see nothing wrong with his conversions, and the least you could do is point out the specifics and provide him with some constructive criticism, instead of just saying the whole thing is complete shit and implying how much better you are than him at doing them. It seems to me like you're just instigating an argument in hopes that everyone will see how rebellious and badass you truely are .  There's a clear difference between being brutally honest, or just some egotistical asshole, and you're walking the line.  Again, please stay out of this thread if you have nothing nice to say.  I am really sick of repeating this and would really appreciate if the discussion be focused towards the research.  If you have nothing constructive to add, simply do not bother saying it...

I haven't calld out anyone's weaknesses or strengths, nor have I implied that I was better than anyone else.. I did however, say Pawlo's conversions are horrible
and that he should stop doing them, and/or stop posting images of them - think of it as me listening to him sing and honestly telling him he's horrible at it and to please stop-
you might obviously see it as being mean, whereas I see it as being kind (cruel to be kind?) - so these unfounded things that you have accused me of, I can only assume them
to be your own innermost thoughts of what your misinterpreting mind's eye was telling you you read? ..hell idk, I'm not inside your unbaked head.. lol

and considering this thread has quite literally only received 5 on topic posts in the last 10 pages (excluding the countless "help me's I can't read" of course), 
your extreme anal retentiveness about it is rather hypocritical imo .. in fact, the only two things I've said to you in the last two posts was where I had
apologized for the off topic posts, yet you insist on ranting about them like nobody's aware of it (myself in particular)- which imo, makes you the only 1
looking to instigate an argument instead of laughing off my initial statement like 98% of the human race would have done 

(btw, the only reason Simon's bent, is because nobody at my site (myself included) is willing to do half of his work for him as per his requests)

but for the mentally impaired, here's what I was referencing when I stated that Pawlo is horrible at conversions

Pawlo- [http://img535.imageshack.us/img535/1191/29734586.jpg](http://img535.imageshack.us/img535/1191/29734586.jpg) - [http://img441.imageshack.us/img441/83/57450335.png](http://img441.imageshack.us/img441/83/57450335.png)

(↑ game he's modding)

so not only does he have no visible textures assigned to the interior, there's no driver and every single material setting is for crap-
and OH, I almost forgot, he just claimed that he did that last conversion in 2hrs and will have all 400 FM3 cars done in a month.. if that
doesn't scream incompetent waste of a damn good model, idkwtf does- 

and with that said, I'm spent.. there goes 30 minutes I'll never get back over explaining to the mentally lame what is and what isn't (now THAT was an implication)

sincerely I find very funny to see a similar phrase from the same person who asked and prayed all the users of his forum (oh yes, I have read that ridiculous thread) to "assault in mass" the xentax forum (see [thread](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?p=38129#p38129)) with the senseless idea of being able to stop the creation of a phantomatic tool crying things like "please don't do it" and vandalizing the (already senseless) thread in a perfect childish+girl style.

really, I would have found more appropriate the citation of Hello Kitty rather than Scarface.

NOTE that this is in reply to his last 2 totally brainless posts because I partially agree with the first one (*edit* I mean with the concept, not this particular case except for the big images) and I add also that this whole thread is in the wrong section of the forum (it was for the 3d section) and annoys who follows the game archive related forum.

and with that said, I'm spent.. there goes 30 minutes I'll never get back over explaining to the mentally lame what is and what isn't (now THAT was an implication)
What?!
Do you know how it looks 3d format in CP. Hierarchy and textures is similar to Forza 3. I write all new and did not use anything old. Shaders is from version 1.0 because have bug(1.5) with shadows. When I finish writing new shaders and then you compare pictures.I using Maya and work on it is very fast and simple. CP is not support interior, but added camera in cocpit and work good (gauges, stering wheel, and mirror), Do you know anything about this game?

If your horizon is so small ... then think what you want to think.

But the true is this has nothing to do with my "Request" on your forums. If you think that you are dumb.

I think you are very weak. You could help peoples who are not so great converting, but telling them to stop their work and how ugly it is, is not nice!! Before you start searching Errors from other peoples look into a Mirror...

And now please B2T the Topic is About Forza 3 and not offending other peoples.

Kotton, fuck off outta here, buddy.
You are insulting the people here and their converts/jobs.
There is no need to be such an asshole in this thread.
Leave these people alone and forget it.

And to be honest, the screens from pawlo, I like them.
I didnt know what game he had converted, but I neither didnt know
its Clipping Point.
Forza 3 models looks nice in CP.


@Ernegien,
do you have any plans/idea's for the gamefiles?
Do you need any help?
You have succeeded to crack the carbin files from the Xbox contents  
That costs alot of time and skills.
I am still impressed about your programming skills.
The holidays are coming!

I tell it like it is, plain and simple.. if someone is too female to hear how lousy they're doing, then don't bring it into public view -period-
and trust Simon, my social skills pwn every single person you've met, and will ever meet ..and this is simply because I get paid for them
sides, how boring would this world be if there were no shit talkers, if there were nobody to challenge or call out? *yawn 

here, lemme use a relevant parable;

"What you lookin' at? You all a bunch of fuckin' assholes. You know why? You don't have the guts to be what you wanna be! You need people like me. 
You need people like me so you can point your fuckin' fingers and say, "That's the bad guy." So... what that make you? Good? You're not good. 
You just know how to hide, how to lie. Me, I don't have that problem. Me, I always tell the truth. Even when I lie. So say good night to the bad guy! 
Come on. The last time you gonna see a bad guy like this again, let me tell you. Come on. Make way for the bad guy. There's a bad guy comin' through! 
Better get outta his way!" 

again, sorry about the offtop.. but I can't just sit here and let ignorance in the guise of wisdom prevail

Well, it is easy to criticise everyone, but, why don't you upload any of your conversions so we can rate your skills. If they are good enough we will agree that your words have some point.

As an outsider looking into this forum, I am saddened to see the updates taken behind closed doors.  I can't say I was involved in the project.  I enjoyed following the progress of it.  I learn most by examining others works.  Being able to dissect fantastic 3d models and play in their viscera will make me a better 3d modeler.  I can only hope you rethink the decision to leave this thread.  You are letting the action of one affect many.  

This can be righted.  It only takes a mod to clean out all of the posts that are off topic*.  At 40 pages I would gladly volunteer to do the work of deleting posts. 

edit *An alternative is ignoring a user by adding them to your foe list.

Let me assure you. I fully support all continued work out in public, preferably in this thread. I agree that it should not be behind closed doors, but instead be shared with everyone. This site is about modding, and models are part of that. So I invite you all to continue on topic. Any more flame posts will result in all posts of that person deleted and the person banned.

Well.. IMO all non-related posts should be deleted, also, someone should sum up importing/exporting to the most popular 3D applications, so newbies wouldn't ask around that, either. Somewhere else (Holy Cow section, or wherever), someone should create a topic specially for FM3 mesh renders/converts picture post&commentary, so this thread would remain purely for research purposes.

About the Kotton thing: since I'm down with him, I wouldn't really add much. Though that E30 without any interior texture looks kinda strange. Kotton, by the way, has released many mods, and as George said, has really high skills. He's a bit of a jerk, but he's like House M.D.

Of course you need Bundler.exe from the XDK 

How to use? Read the Documents it's very easy

I didn't said the opposite my friend. I never seen his work. That's why I said, if he is good enough he can post some of his work, and if it is good indeed I will be the first to admit it.

However, his criticism could be a little bit more polite. We are all fans of racing games here, we don't need to argue. If something doesn't like to us we can simply mention it without being rude. That's all i'm saying.

Thanks Mr. Mouse and Craptain for doing what you can to help keep this thread on topic, it is much appreciated.

The internet is not some virtual world where you can do and say whatever the hell you want without any regard for others.  This topic has always been about the research, and I would like to continue doing so in this thread, provided that people maintain proper levels of respect for others in this community.  Please remember that those who contribute to this community do not owe anybody anything.  They do it in their own free time because they simly love doing so.  Do not ruin it for us.

That being said, I've made a little bit more progress last night and this morning mapping out track objects.  It is currently only rendering the first piece in each object, so some may still look a bit incomplete, and I haven't cared to pinpoint normals for each of the different vertex formats that they use yet, so some of the lighting may seem pretty weird as well.

The ultimate goal here is to get the track mesh and objects extracted to have a nice scene to render the cars on.  I currently have no plans on extracting much of anything else and definitely do not plan on re-importing them into Forza or any other game so please do not bother me with such requests.  So far I've mapped out past the filetable on the main track files (.stx.bin) with no real sight of the mesh data yet.  I will be sure to post my updated project's source once I've figured a little more about it all.

Yes it is possible. in the list of material properties i posted about 10 pages back for Energien, you can see it has slots for diffuse maps ( colour ), specular maps, bump mapping ( normal maps ) in fact most channels that have a setting can also have a texture applied to them. but to be honest we did say  when we was asking Energien to add MTL support that we only needed a blank diffuse channel, as thats enough to get us the separate surfaces to map to.  also adding the texture slot really is just lazyness for the user, while yes it would be nice to just load in the carbin file and dump it out fully textured its not really needed, we can map textures to the models just fine with what we have right now. 

But yes it is possible.. altho its coded in the MTL file not the object itself. obj stores all its UV information in the model, and stores all its surface info in the mtl ( btw an mtl file is just a txt file you can open and edit it directly in notepad )

If you check the project source in ForzaStudioForm.cs under the ExportOBJ() method, you will see that I actually started playing around with assigning default shader properties for various parts.  Eventually I may add support for game textures (although I really have no experience with x360 image formats) or have default custom ones, but for now I felt they aren't really needed since most people will just want to use theirs anyways.  Right now I guess I'm mainly focusing on decoding these files, and saving the more trivial stuff for later...

Looks like I overlooked the simple possibility of the entire track mesh being contained within all of the individual track objects.  At first I thought the track mesh was separate, but I seem to have been mistaken, and what a relief that is 

The picture below is just a VERY rough proof of concept, that only renders the first piece of each object and skips any object with a vertex format I haven't mapped out yet, so there is lots missing still.  I am currently in the middle of a major core rewrite of some of the code to make it easier for me to support different kinds of 3d objects in all versions of Forza, and hopefully I should have some real progress and supporting source within the week

It looks like most Forza 2 tracks are contained within Forza 3 so no it's not a huge priority of mine at the moment...

I will most likely need some help in that area, or I will just have to do quite a bit of research on my own, since textures are even less of a strongpoint than models are for me :X

Hi all!
I ve got question: Is there any way to get orginal proporties of wheels you know size of tyres, width etc.. because in game is only one wheel sometimes front and sometimes rear. In game the wheels are cloned from one to four and they are different to each other, esspecially Ferrari's F50GT front tyres are smaller than rear. pls help me if You can.

Yes: [http://www.google.com/#hl=en&safe=off&q ... cda37c2de9](http://www.google.com/#hl=en&safe=off&q=Ferrari+F50+tire+size&aq=f&aqi=&aql=&oq=&gs_rfai=&fp=705fd3cda37c2de9)
Wheel size, in.  	18 x 8.5/18 x 13.0
Wheel type/material 	Cast magnesium
Tire size, f/r 	245/35ZR18/335/30ZR18

That took maybe 9 seconds.

That is impossible.
The data of the wheels are not stored in the carbin files.
They are stored in xml data like the maxdata.xml and or carattribs.xml.
So there is no solution or a way to get all the four wheels in the rights positions.

It is most definitely possible.  The best way would probably be for me to write a small utility to compile an intermediate file containing all of the different kinds of miscellaneous car information and distribute that with my application.  Unfortunately, this really isn't too big of a concern for me at the moment, but I may do something of the sort later down the road...

It would be great if you put this small utility to into forza studio.

Have been following the discussion with great interest however there is one set of  carbin files that are not opening in forza studio,quite probably they are not 3d models but they are contained in the .carbin ,these are in the Livery.zip on disc 1.quickbms extracts these without any errors but an error log is created with forza each time u try to open them.
Folders within the livery.zip are decals and vinyls.If any get some time and want to take a look at them the original Livery.zip is here,u need to open with quick bms,
[http://i9nx3u.1fichier.com/en/Livery.zip](http://i9nx3u.1fichier.com/en/Livery.zip)

Yeah I've noticed that as well and just haven't cared to map out any of the livery structure yet.  Honestly I don't really have any interest in doing so at the moment and I don't know that I ever will unfortunately.  If someone can help me out with the 360 texture formats used in this game and give me some working knowledge of their decompression and deswizzling, I will definitely have another look though.  I contacted shadowmoy a while back but he really didn't tell me anything I didn't already know, and I'm not one to bother people for information...

I hate to sound noobish and i don't really want to start another topic. Can somebody rip and send me 2 cars and their textures please? the 2010 dodge challenger srt and 2010 chevy camaro ss. I've updated my .net framewort but still get the ""Could not load file or assembly 'Microsoft.Xna.Framework, Version=3.1.0.0""  error.

Thanks

how about adding an attach tool into forza studio? like attach by texture or group or you choose what to attach, that would make having to sift through and attach parts a thing of the past considering the sheer amount of little parts.

Thats a stupid idea.
If that will be implented, you'll double the polycounts since F3 models
have many times copied parts.
Better just leave like this now and no attach tool.
You'd better off attaching the models in a 3D apps.
And heck, thats more easier in 3D apps!
And attach by textures? Come on, what you want if there is texture materials and even
material lists wich makes alot easier.
Just put the model and the .mtl in same folder so the textures materials will be loaded.

So all what you ask...can be done in 3D apps.

the only thing that bothers me about this importing program is that some little details like badges/ keyholes/interior bits look like they've been chewed bcuz of the bad verts 

Other than this is great

REALLY????? WOW...... end sarcasm 

what i meant was being able to attach things while they're still in their groups, instead of sifting through a long list of parts.

Honestly I still have no idea what you're talking about.  Each sub-part (leaf node) is named after its texture and I export a materials file with the obj so all textures are mapped to their respective sub-parts.  They are required to be unattached so that you can apply proper textures.  Adding functionality to condense similar-textured parts into the same groups would just be useless, since these are things I'm assuming you can easily do with modeling applications.  My tool is there to provide the lowest level extraction functionality possible, and you can do the rest in whatever modeling app you choose...

when you open the .cabin file everything is nice in tidy in their sub groups
like
bumperfa
bumperfb
ect, when you export them into the obj it loses the sub groups and you have a list of like 100 parts to sift through and attach because they go to the same texture, what i was suggesting is an attach tool to give the user an option to attach some of the parts together while still in forza studio instead of spending alot of time clicking through a huge list and finding out what's clear light glass and what goes to the no damage texture and so on.

Maybe in forza studio on export to obj automatically create Dummy with name of the group and link objects to it?

I think Shared folder into tire texture of lod0 (sidewallA,sidewall_NRM,treadA,treadA_NRM)
Where into tire model of lod0 ?

.obj is the most widely accepted and used model format for almost every 3D application.
What file format are you looking to have, and what program are you using that cannot import obj?

Hello, first of all I want to thank you guys for all the hard work you putted in bringing up this tools. Now my questions... I´m converting the 99 civic si, from the dvd2, and I´m converting the interior, but it´s very highpoly, is there more LOD´s of the interior hidded in another location in the DVD´s? Or is just one interior for each car? 
 And I´m using OS seven ultimate 64bits, and I can´t run the forza studio, not even in compatibility mode, I´m only able to use it in a laptop with XP professional 32bits. 
 Here is the error, it says that the program has encountered and error and It goes to close

If the lod0 interior isn't high enough poly for you I don't know what is   There should be a few different interior versions starting with lod0-lod5.  The individual cockpitlod0.carbin file is where the highest poly one is contained.  As for the error you are encountering, I'm actually developing on Windows 7 Ultimate 64-bit.  Is it by any chance using an asian language pack?  The error thumbnail you've posted doesn't link to a higher quality image so I can't really see much of anything.  It should of however dumped an error.txt file in the application directory if you would like to paste that as well...

No lol, I wanted a cockpit with less poligons, but I can´t find it, the only carbin file I could find with the cockpit is the hon_civicsi_99.carbin, wich is too much highpoly.
 But talking about the error, no my OS system language is Portuguese, from Portugal. The error message I´ve ported, just says "the application stopped working", and I can´t find any *txt file in the Forza Studio directory

What file format are you looking to have, and what program are you using that cannot import obj?
When I export only "body" (which contains some smaller parts) and import it by Blender, it doesn't work. When I import it in MeshLab, it works, but when I export it to .3ds all parts are united and it has only one material. I thought about Zmodeler format, I know, it's not the best program, but it's free and very easy to use.

I'm fairly certain that my code properly groups things according to the obj specifications, and it may just be those applications not doing their job (or incorrect import/export settings)

You would be correct with that diagnosis.. on export from forza studio the model is split into appropriate parts.  rafal345 problem will be occurring during the export to 3ds. either the program he is using is limited ( in a bad way ) or he is not checking to make sure the " export as single object" has been UNchecked in the export settings. I know the export from FS is fine, coz ive been converting some of the cars myself  and if they had been exporting as single objects i would never use them as its too fiddly to split afterwards.  Also cant wait for the next version hopefully we will be able to play about with that track exporter /me Hopes...

Sorry for the delay, I had planned on releasing this sooner but things have been rather busy lately.  Anyways, I spent a little time rewriting portions of the application and then breaking others.  Currently, it is functional enough to render and export Forza 3 car and track objects.  Tracks are looking pretty decent, but I haven't completely finished decoding the model structure in its entirety, so some pieces will look a bit incomplete until then.  There's still lots to add and more cleanup to be done, but I figured it's about time for another stable release.  I appreciate the patience and look forward to contine building out this tool.  Any help would be much appreciated in the area of texture extraction/decoding since I am really at a disadvantage in that area and with the 360 in general   Also, I am quite aware that this doesn't play very nice in some non-english operating systems.  It really isn't a huge concern for me at the moment but is definitely something I plan to look more into as things progress.  Enjoy

This latest version didn´t also work on my system, but now I got a error.txt from it.


BTW, my system:
OS W7 ultimate 64bits (portugal)
intel core quad cpu q9400
ATI radeon hd 5700 series
4GB ddr2

ps: I´ve tried it on my laptop and it works  maybe it´s because the laptop uses a nvidia 9600m gt, and my desktop uses a nvidia, because the OS is the same in both    
 I´ve used Forza studio 5.23.10, 5.29.10, and 7.9.10 in both computers.

Hi all.First of all,many thanks for your great work! I've a question: how can i open the files of the digital gauges (i mean the bgf,bsg and fbf files) ? I've made,with a friend of mine,some conversions from forza 3 but i've completely no idea how to convert those files.Thanks in advance.Bye!

I took a quick glance at those files in a hex editor and I didn't really see any model data.  Is it possible that they are used for something else instead?

Under the tracks directory you can either open the entire bin.zip file, or the individual rmb.bin files inside of that zip if you have extracted the files already.  I would recommend just opening the entire track zip...

Just updated to the latest Forza Studio. Some nice improvements! hats off to ya!

I have a question though. In unpacking a track bin I couldnt locate any texture files. All i have are bins and bix's I couldnt see them anywhere else in the iso structure so I wondered if anyone can point me in the right direction?

I'm yet to try unpacking each bin to see if it houses a single texture but i'm on my way to work so won't be able to try if for a while.

cheers,

Yeah textures and shaders are internal to the .bix files I believe.  I can only tell you that I've gotten through most of the .rmb.bin files which have all of the model data and then a reference to an .fxobj afterwards.  I've also parsed through the main stx.bin track file enough to pull out a filetable and some other misc. information, and the .bix and .bin files are still completely unknown at the moment since I haven't really looked through them.  Maybe I'll take the time to extract some of these internal structures and see if anyone can take a look...

I had a quick look inside a bix and there definitely seems to be some repeating patterns. i found e555 (text) cropped up a lot in the file I inspected. TBH i'm so out of my depth with this that I'm unlikely to be of any practical help decoding a file format! 

From a morale point of view, i'm right here cheering you on though!

Yeah I'm experiencing those same errors with no real solution as of yet.  Maybe they are using the same tool to optimize their ingame models?  I bet if you import that model into 3ds preserving its accompanying normals it will look alright though.  It only looks messed up when modeling applications recalculate normals based on the lesser precision vertices.  As for the newest version of Forza Studio, it can be found here [viewtopic.php?p=40425#p40425](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?p=40425#p40425)

I know that this thread is mostly dedicated to the extraction of the models and other components of Forza 3. But I didn't wanted to create a new topic just to place a simple question, so:

-Is there a way to import custom vinyls to the game? I thought of it like it can be done with the paint tool hacks on Smackdown vs. Raw 2010. Unfortunately I didn't managed to find where the saved vinyls are stored on the HD. I guess that they may be encrypted on the profile file. 

So, has anyone tried this yet?

Hello guys im new in this Forum. I'm a 3d Modeler at the moment i'm working on a Mercedes-Benz E Class W212 2009. Now i saw that's possible to get 3d Models from Forza Motorsport. The W212 is available in "The Road&Track Car Pack". Now I'm asking you guys if somebody can give me the files. The High Poly and Mid-Poly one. I need the Model for comparisson for my W212. Because the Forza Model is scanned it is 100% perfect so yeah. Would be nice thx

Do not request copyrighted content here.
Also, the models are not scanned.
The higher budget cars are laid out in-person for 3D topology and checked for measurements, but that is it.
This was only done on a select few cars where the interior was more important to get correct.

They took a fancy laser and scanning program, found the cars and scanned them. they were not modeled traditionally like most of us do.

Either use "WXripper" and "Hot swap" the dvd to make an iso. Or find an iso from somewhere else.... Then open it in "wx360" (included with wxripper)

If you don't know what any of those things are, then you need to search for them ( on this site and google ). Extracting files from Xbox360 dvd's is a fairly generic question to ask. This thread is pretty much dealing with things that happen AFTER you have extracted the dvd. There are plenty of threads already around explaining how to rip from 360 disks.

first let me thank all of u that have make the Forza Studio come true   an awesome piece of software 

may i ask one question, would it be possible (in the near future) that we can write back changes in the *.bin or *.carbin files?
that would may me very happy  

i have (just for fun) done some changes in the coding at FM3 and it would be the icing of cake when it would be possible

That is completely false.
There is a reason that there is nothing to back up that claim.
Many of the cars in the game aren't even accessible by the public.

No it does not.
The fact that the quads are compressed into tris just like every other game engine is what explains the messed up geometry that is encountered in a program that cannot retain the written normals.

Stop spreading misinformation and stop facilitating it.

This was considered, but at this time .3ds isn't going to be supported.
That isn't to say that it isn't out of the question, it just isn't a priority.

Well. I update forza studio to the newest version and I have problem.
[](http://www.imagebam.com/image/0a3b5f91373703) [](http://www.imagebam.com/image/8ef2a591373724) 
The older version didn't have this bug, whats wrong with this? I don't know.

not trying to be rude here, but maybe you should practice what you preach.. 

almost all of Forza's models are produced from real time digitally scanned vehicles
and a 3d program simultaneously creates the model from those scans

Who/What is your source for the fact that "almost all" were scanned?

maybe you should provide a Who/What source for anything otherwise.. as I've already provided proof of Turn10's digital scans to create their models

or did you actually think they were going to scan/computer generate a Bugatti Veryon and not use the same on a VW Touareg or Nissan S15??? xD

I don't recall making any claims that required substantiating. You provided proof they digitally scanned 1 car out of a possible 400. The audio on that video clearly says they either digitally scan the car or they go and take photos of it. Taking photos of a car and then building a 3D model by hand is rather different to digitally scanning it or using CAD data.

yet while scanning the Veyron, you can see the flashes of a camera.. coincidence? not hardly.. to think they would scan the Veyron and nothing else, 
or even scan minimal amounts of the 400+ vehicles and hand model the rest is simply ludicrous, especially considering the levels of precise detail contained within each one
(but let me attempt to dig up video clips, sound recordings and image snaps of every single scan session of every single car just for you :facepalm: xD)

and you don't recall? you just did.. staying within the context of previous statements made, you're prior question certainly implied that they hand modeled the vehicles
..otherwise you wouldn't have askd it... to assume each one, or the majority of, is hand modeled is quite naive.  as these days, every single gazillion dollar corporation 
that creates 3d models (film, gaming or otherwise) uses scans to do so.  it's business 101 and common sense.  why pay a team for one months inaccurate work per car 
when you can get it done with precision in a few days or less.  minimize payout for time in field AND minimize time in field = more profit

the proof is in the pudding, thinking they would only use that method on a few cars is just.. *points finger and laughs* lol

Guys, 

Cool it. I don't want this thread to get bogged down again!

For the record, they aren't laser scanning anything. They are point sampling. you can see them draw tape over the car essentially mapping out the polygons and where they want the detail. The arm with the spike on it knows where it is in 3d space so they tap a button and another point is made. The majority of the polys on that car are square. 

If they had laser scanned it you would get a very uneven mesh which typically would be used as a skin to remodel a clean version. This could have the kinds of smoothing errors we've seen as laser scanning isnt all that accurate. Plus, its not putting detail where you want it, its trying to put it everywhere. The car would be like 10 billion polys or something! A numpty would take that massive mesh and poly reduce it giving the uneven finish.

The fact that they are building a lot of 4 point polys and we are seeing triangular smoothing errors is as someone has already pointed out due to the software used to import the model not reading the normal map. I can confirm Lightwave 3D reads it in perfectly and I have not had a single car with any error. The simplest way I've found to cure smoothing errors is to turn DOWN the smoothing angle. Lightwave by default is 89.6 for some reason. this can round off all sorts of things you don't want like sides around a bolt head, dial edges etc. setting it to 40 degrees still allows the rounding to be smoothed but it doesnt round everything! Turning off smoothing is quite revealing, sure it looks panelled and flat but there are no triangular errors which shows its not the geometry at fault but the normal map.

so, no more lasers.  pew pew pew!  

Mat

What i actually wanted to ask was... Any news on cracking the track textures yet? Has any more progress been made on those? 
I can't wait until we get proper access to them, then we will see some good tracks in other racing games

why does everyone duck and cover or holler stop/chill/coolit when a spirited debate occurs :/ 

@Mat, nobody mentioned anything about lasers pew pew pew (rofl'd @that 1 xD).  scanning is the word Turn10 used to describe the process and a generalization 
which point sampling would easily fall under   anyways.. I subscribe to the theory that the models, when created by pew pew pew's (j/k LOL), like normal 3d models, 
are quite large in 3d space.. and upon completion, are then in essence miniaturized (as most game models are), by which 3d apps have a hard time interpreting 
to the thousandth on something so infinitesimal. if these models were scaled up in 3d space while being read/imported/exported by FS, I'm sure interapplicatory 
travel difficulties and/or chewed mesh on tiny chamfers, ect. would cease and desist ..so thpppt!  lmao

I was commenting on what ibanezjem said. "Fancy laser and scanning program"

Unless they were scaling there numbers outside the range of numerical value (like scaling 0-255 down to 0-128) you halve your resolution but i don't see why they would do that. A golden rule of CGI is it doesnt matter what scale you work to as long as you stick to it. 

If they make a car that is 1mm long, as long as they make a track of an appropriate scale it won't look or behave out of place as long as your game engine variables are sensible for that range of numbers. remember a computer doesnt really know or care what a metre is, its just a word or long word or floating point value. we decide how to represent that when me make the engine.

My request for calm was mearly to try and diffuse what seemed to be a rerun from a few pages ago where the guy ended up getting banned (twice?)

anyhow, any news on track textures?   pew pew pew!!

lolwho? ..oh, someone that commented about some laser on the previous page then? O.o lol ..pew pew pew! ..that just freakn kills me xD

I wouldn't profess to know the inner workings of why most game makers scale the models and game "world" extremely small.. all I know, from personal experience, is that they do

regardless, what I've stated holds true.. if you were to import a FM3 model into Max via FS, then try to create a simple shape such as a cylinder, box, sphere, w/e, the same size as..
oh lets say a lug nut on the model, you can't.  and this is because Max refuses to create anything that "microscopic" in 3d space. if you create a simple shape, it usually needs to be 
about half the the size of the entire car before it will take.. only then can be scaled down to an appropriate size to match something of likeness on the vehicle model.  and after that,
all the tools you use on that mesh go all koo-koo and you need to manually enter the tool modification values in hundredths to get anything resembling precision.. and don't even think 
about performing a complex operation such as boolean, it refuses to take correctly.  whereas on the flypside, if the scale of that simple shape (or any other mesh for that matter) is 
roughly 10 fold, complex operations (such as boolean) and extreme precision on the smallest of it's areas can easily be obtained to the thousands without any adverse effects.. 
hence the damaged mesh on tiny chamfers/ect. they're simply too small for the 3d application to read/write correctly.

So what you are saying is that it should have been called "Micro Machines" instead of Forza Motorsports? 

Anyway interesting discussion.

Sounds like a nasty limitation of 3ds max    Not sure of what max's smallest unit of measurement is.. But in lightwave ( which is what i use to tidy up these cars ) you can create objects as small as 0.1 um by 0.1 um ( micrometers, 0.001 millimeter = 1 um ) so i dont really run into this problem.....  
Actually forget that last bit.. i just loaded up one of the cars i converted and it seems to be at real world scale, altho i do not recall scaling up the size.. unless the conversion from max to lightwave scaled it???? thats probably why im not running into any size problems. But that does still seem like a nasty limitation if you cannot go down to 0.01mm or 1um..

Hi wabbits, (i'm not typing that all in!)

I seem to recall a scale and rotation option when you import with max. That said, even if its not there surely you can just scale up by 10 or 100 as a first step and scale down again when done. As long as jot down your scaling choice it shouldnt matter.

If max is rounding off really heavy floating point values this may be where the issue is. Look out for that scale option on import, thats you best chance.

Different container, yes.  Different format, I doubt it, although it's certainly possible.  Regardless, that isn't the main issue here, it's that I haven't really looked into taking the texture data and converting it to a usable image.  I don't know what format it's in, how it's decompressed, or how its deswizzled.  I know there are some who do, and I haven't really felt like wasting my time redoing someone else's hard work...

@Mat; agreed, one can easily use the scale option in Max upon import.. but on apps that don't have this option, the model 
scale should be set at 1.0 (1=1), which equals the scale it was read/created at..? Zmodeler for example, has no import
options and imports as 1.0, which forces me to use the 1.0 scale in Max if I'm to line up any parts that I create in Max
(I can't model in Zmodeler to save my life, and basically refuse to lol). for example, I import the scene to both apps,
model the door sills, engine/engine bay, baggage compartment, ect.. export the parts as .obj, then import to the waiting 
Zmodeler scene and viola, perfect alignment.  if I were to use the scale up option avail in Max import, the following 
would be the results when exporting the parts to use in Zmodeler.. 

[](http://www.imagebam.com/image/19209691691245) 

the smaller model is the Zmodeler import results, the large model is from the Max export after using the scale up import option..
if one uses the default import settings for Max (1=1), the smaller model is the result and perfect alignment is achieved when
any/all parts are used between the two apps

but I personally have had no problems with damaged mesh since FS-5.29.10 (or whichever version implemented the cleanup of 2d polys).. 
I'm just trying to describe the theory I subscribe to which could be the reason(s) others might still be seeing this problem of damaged mesh,
especially around the tiny chamfers.. (yes, I'm wasting everyone's time while attempting to keep things interesting ..j/k xD lmao)

Has anyone successfully converted the Ford Fiesta (2009) including textures for 3dsmax?

If someone managed to map all the textures properly (i suck at 3dsmax) it would be nice if you could upload it 

i drive the car myself and would like to play around with the model but im not good at assigning the correct textures

Thats the problem i have too... if you import without materials the model will look fine...

Somehow the materials don't get assigned to the model properly 

EDIT:
I've gotten this far now:


I have started recreating and assigning every material for every little modelpart... which sucks

This is not a help topic too.
its about research and you guys sucks major nuts by ruining this topic
full with your useless posts.

@above, learn how to import files correctley.
And learn about 3D programs.
And make sure the .mtl file is in the same folder as the obj file.
For assigning materials and textures are your problems.

As bigbear said... You need to know a little about 3d apps  before you try messing with this sort of thing. I can confirm Forza studio will rip the cars fine and the textures WILL assign properly. IF you know how to use 3d apps and know about using material files and textures properly. Forza studio doesnt do everything for you, there is still work to be done after you rip them.

the mtl file is in the same folder too. Using Cinema 4D or 3ds Max 2011. I only have the question if i have to figure out which material belongs to which texture. If yes ok im done than i know what ive to do.

Your 3D models?
The models are not yours, buddy.

The materials have names, readable names so you can easily assign them by yourself.

Ya, sure there are many other games which you can find car they don't exist in FM3. Like Project Gotham Racing, Gran Turismo, etc. And many of us want to do some modding, but, Energier is the only guy knows how to make a research, and I guess isn't easy also. So since he has prioreties and don't getting paid for what he is doing, we can't push him making something else. I really wish we knew how to mod games, but...

Hello gentlemen, I'm new here...
...I followed up this thread and I have tried the soft. I would like to share my reflections:
(just for information, Im working as architect using professional CAD software)
Now I did watch carefully imported in to Forza Studio (FM3)carbine file in Forza before export (I did also small camera set changes, to get better inspecting the mesh)
Now the "smooth" problem that we have here, seems not smoothing at all to me. It seems not normals problem as well.
This seems like Forza Studio need to be more precise during importing process, because in some cases, when the points are very close FS are weld them, now this is real problem I think, everything else seems like results of that.
I can post some pictures however all of U can see this by dooing right zoom, is there any chance to force FS to be more careful ?

Hello damusto, unfortunately Forza Studio is pretty much as precise as it can get.  As far as I know (I would really love if someone would prove me wrong and fix the issue), the smoothing issues you are experiencing are due to the lack of precision in the datatypes used to store the vertex data.  The accompanying normals offset these smoothing problems and make things render fine ingame (as well as any modeling application that can preserve those normals upon import). However, when recalculating new normals off of the less precise vertex data, things don't look so good anymore...

So, if I understand you correctly,the problem is not to construe the verts record, only the record itself right ?
Ok I'm glad I You did explain it to me, thanks Mate.

in that case I need to try now this method right ?

1. Exported a Car from Forza Studio
2. Imported the Obj in 3DS Max
3. Exported as Open Collada
4. Imported in 3D SimEd
5. Exported as Open Collada dae
6. Imported in 3DS Max again

However I need some tip, because something is not working proper. I did try that already, unfortunately landed on some problem.
I am able to done only the first 5 points, then when I try to import it in 3DS Max again I cant - seems that something is wrong with file ? Could any one please help me to solve it, where can I commit an mistake ?

You want something like this?

Try this:
Import CARBIN with Forza Studio and export as OBJ.
Import OBJ with DeepExploration and export as X.
Import X with 3DSimEd and export as DAE.
Import DAE with 3dsmax and you're done!

Hello, i have a Question about Exporting Cars out of Forza 3.
I Have the New Xbox 360 Slim and the Original Game, i have Disk 1 Put in into my Blu Ray Drive and all i see is 151 Megabytes and a Stucture of a Normal Video DVD.
Now i have tried to Connect the 250GB HDD (Sata) from The XBox 360 Slim to my PC, but no connection -.- (xplorer360) or what ever.
What System uses Microsoft on the New Slim XBox?
FATX,HSF?
I found nothing on the Internet about that.

They are inside of zip files made by Turn10.
Open that zip and you'll see these .xds files.
Impossible to miss them out.

If no, then its up to you because we dont supply people the files.

I converted BMW M5 to GTA4. The mesh is converted, but textures interior are missing. Are they on a Forza 3 disk and in which folder?
It look like this, on this time:

Hey everyone, first, I'd like to say thanks for all your hard work in creating this awesome program, really appreciate it.

I have a few questions about the camera, though, while I'm "flying" around the scene, checking out the car, if I press up on my keyboard the focus seems to change to the tabs above the 3d window, so when I press right, it switches tabs, gets a bit annoying to have to continually click in the 3d window, just wondering if there's possibility for a fix? Or if there is a fix, please point me in the right direction.

Second question, would it be possible to create a different type or camera? A rotating on a central pivot kind of one, like the ones in, for example, 3D Studio Max, I just thought it might be easier to use. (using the mouse to rotate, scroll to zoom and so on...).

Sorry if any of this has been discussed before, I have read the whole thread a while ago and don't recall anything about this.

Import X with 3DSimEd and export as DAE.
Import DAE with 3dsmax and you're done!

Why that is impossible to me on your method.
How you have made converting? Write please more in detail.

I did so:
1 - Import CARBIN with Forza Studio and export as OBJ

2 - Import OBJ with DeepExploration 5.5 and export as format X.

3 Import X with 3DSimEd and export as Collada DAE.

4 - Import DAE with 3dsmax 2010 and I have an error... 

Format DAE can't be export to 3ds max.
Here the image of my error at import in 3ds max ***.dae

HELP PLEASE.
How it to correct, what I have made not correctly?

Exported as Open Collada Imported into Max and now I can convert to Editable Poly and play around without any Errors.

Look I "played" and all is right:

Hello,
Help please. How you have made that in 3ds max it was possible работь with editable poly? At you quality also remains to model equal? Or has worsened... It becomes seems at export a grid of models of a curve...
Explain please your method. I tried to do:
carbin--> obj
import obj MAYA. mesh-cleanup. export to Collada DAE.
import model in 3ds max. 
3ds max. Convert to editable poly and quality at once there are dents...
How it to correct? At you all has passed successfully?

A note for anyone who is quoting posts with screenshots.
Do not quote the screens many times over and over.
Its annoying and with these quoted posted screens, it makes reading not nice.


@Tarec, its your videochip.
Its onboard and its from Intel, VIA, or Sis Mirage.
These chips are very horrible and only for Office and Internet.
There is no solution for this problem.
But there are 2 option:
1) get a better laptop.
2) get a PC with better grapic card.

> I converted BMW M5 to GTA4. The mesh is converted, but textures interior are missing. Are they on a Forza 3 disk and in which folder?To answer this for you and anyone else that seems to struggle. NO they are not on disk 3 everything you need for the car is in the Zip files on disk 1.  The same zip as you extracted the car model and the exterior textures from. When you extract the zip file, you should have something like this..
2 folders one named Livery masks and one names physics.
2 XML documents named "carattribs" and "shadersettings"
1 HTML build report
Approximately 10 .Carbin files ( models )
Approximately  10 .XDS files ( textures )

For the .Carbin models you should have AT LEAST! 4 rotor models, 4 calliper models, a main model for the body in your case here bmw_m5_09.carbin, an LOD0 version of that car and a cockpit model.

For the textures you should have AT LEAST! 4 images for lights, a lights and a lights_lod0 for both damaged and non damaged. 4 images for the exterior, again 2 for damaged and 2 for non damaged. 
And finally a " interior_lod0.xds " file  THIS is the interior textures.

BTW i just unzipped the BMW M5 myself and ALL of those files have been extracted ( including the Interior_lod0.xds ) so it must be a user error rather than a software error that you are experiencing.

Here's what the contents of the BMW M5 should look like. [](http://img831.imageshack.us/i/bmwqn.jpg/)

So no one has ever had this problem before? 
this is a pic of what happens, if someone is willing to give me some of the obj formats for the cars fine. I just thought its more convenient if someone could help me fix this so I could get what cars I wanted/needed.

@ Panesar,

its either your PC or the drivers/software.
Have you installed the latest XNA FrameNetwork and FrameNetwork?
You need atleast framenetwork 3.5.

And yeah, I never have this problem.
Once I downloaded ForzaStudio the first time, it works immediateley.

thanks for the reply,
I have installed XNA Framework 3.1 I think, and my computer already has .NET Framework 4.0, so its possibly my graphics drivers that need updating?

Updated my gfx drivers but it still doesn't work.

Updating the gfx card, hmm.
My GPU has a driver installed one year old.
Im not sure if the XNA 3.1 is the latest software.
But I think Visual Basic needs to be installed.

Whats your gfx?
Mine's a laptop equipped with nVidia 9600M GT.

I have an nVidia GeForce 310, the new driver just enabled my card for the new 3D craze. I checked, im sure XNA 3.1 is the latest will check again, I'm pretty sure I don't have Visual basic, so I will give that a go.

Guys I have question, I did screen shot from imported Lod 0 model for U, please look on this and try to answer my question, are those models really look this way in game too ? Its hard to believe for me.

I do have a lot experience with all kinds 3d models, and I can ensure U that better way for this game would be lighter model with normal maps that this garbage. My point is that we do have some problem with all LODs not only 0, I found this on all imported models even in lod 5, only U can see it better on lod 0.
I dont know is this Forza Studio or some 10Tacel slip, can anyone here post some game closeup screens please ?

Regarding distorted (bumpy) mesh issues I've done some testing and I'm 99.9% sure that there is nothing wrong with the car meshes inside the game or scale/amount of polys they've got.

I have tried importing obj that come out of forza studio inside max, maya,zmodeler and they are all screwed in the same way.

So what I've done for testing purposes was created same size mesh as the forza cars with some chamfered edges inside 3ds Max and exported as an obj with different OBJ EXPORT PRECISION which controls actual vertex cordinates precision while exporting then imported those obj back in to 3ds max.
Export precision level 3 gave me SAME DISTORTED LOOKING mesh as Forza Studio obj when I have imported them back in. Meshes exported only at level 6 or higher was coming back in like they were.

What I am saying is that actual mesh is geting mest up while beeing exported from forza studio. That hapens to any lod or any car model exported. It's harder to see it in lower poly meshes but after applying paint shader you will.

And I am praying to all posible gods that Ernegien or anybody else will look in how to increse obj export precision from forza studio

Would you mind explaining to me exactly what that is I'm looking at above?  To my knowledge, the mesh information is exported perfectly from Forza Studio.  If something isn't exporting correctly, it would help to include the Forza Studio build you're using and the .carbin file you're loading, so I can reproduce your results.

When the developers of Forza export the models into the format used by the game, the vertex information undergoes a certain loss of precision.  The reason they still look good ingame is because the normals are preserved with a higher precision so the game can smooth out the mesh with those.  When you take one of the models exported from Forza Studio, and import it into a modeling application that recalculates these normals, it will look bad because it's using normals calculated from less precise vertex data.  You need to render your models in an application that can use the pre-existing normals.  I know 3ds max does, and I'm sure there are others that will give you the option...

OK I will try to explain more precisely.
What U are looking on is headlamp in side view. This one is imported directly to 3d Studio from Forza Studio using the OBJ file, however no matter how will U do it (I did this in many ways) the mesh will always look that way.
U are right about normals, it is possible to get them right and its easy with Deep Exploration, but what I can NOT agree is this whole story about the vertex information undergoes loss of precision, this is nonsense. U see I was doing models for real time renders many times, there is no point to save so huge mesh (like LOD 0) with so many verts issues only for nice normals, its a lot better save lighter model (like LOD 1) with mapped normal maps textures saved from proper LOD 0 model.
This way, no matter what, U have proper shapes and shading, reflections and everything alse U need, and of course U have light model so U can rise FPS or use more models at this same time.
NOW WHAT IM THINKING IS THAT MAYBE, BETTER WAY TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM IS TO GET VERTS INFO FROM NORMALS IF THEY ARE PERFECT IN HERE ? BUT I DONT KNOW IS IT POSSIBLE - U see Im moddeler not programmer
I hope this explanation is helpful somehow, if not I can try to develop it but I need some tips, feel free to ask I can share all my game moddeling experience

now please look at this
HP model like FM3 LOD 0 or even -1 
[](http://img23.imageshack.us/i/bbse50v2.jpg/)

LP model like LOD 1

LP model with more textures

Zmodeler2 imports the .obj files perfectley.
Without no problems and all.
It must be these expensive and profesionall 3D apps.
I can import obj into zmodeler, export it as .3ds and all goes fine.
No bugs, no glitches.

Forza Studio is a gold program.

2.2.3 never has obj filter.
OBJ is only available in Zmodeler 2.2.4

hi everyone 

thanks for this great tool

I extrackted everything from disk 1 &2 and the dlc carpacks

but did anyone found the driver from this game . I only have the car the wheels the rotor and caliper.

but where is the driver located  and the texture for it.

here a first test reder from the 599xx

I dont think the drivers are in the Cars folder but somewhere else.
Its a good idea to explore the whole disc, maybe you'll find something interesting.

And a nice render.
So its not the tool wich caused the bugged renders by some people.

If you mean the problem people had with normals causing nasty patches when oyu render the models,  i think that's down to what app you are using, as some handle normals slightly different.

Its not app you are using, its not only normals problem, look at the reflections on this render, U can see here very very good that this model have a lot geometry problems. Thats why I think we need to look for some solution and make this great tool (FS) better

Energien has already enough things on his head to concentrate on them.
He clearley has cracked the geometry and made the models fully import-able.
You people should be happy and glad he did it.
It something you can see it every day.
Its big endian and models from Xbox360, wich they are very very and very hard to crack.
Few pages ago, Air One has rendered a FM3 model fully without bugs/glitches.
PM how he did it.
And besides, importing an file is not always good.
When importing Forza Studio .obj into Zmodeler224, all goes fine.
Export it from Zmodeler224 to obj, import it into 3ds max, all goes fine.
Export it back to obj and import it in Zmodeler224, the mesh turns out into black.
Using the Calculate tool, they all goes fine.

Its the way how you deal with 3D and meshes.
If somethings doesn't work properley, it doesn't mean its bad for good.
Think about the possibilities and how you can fix it.

And besides, After Forza3 Ultimate Collection will be released worldwide in 2011,
they'll develope Forza 4.

idd but when you work a bit on the car you can solve the problems look @ this it's much better and you can make some nice renders then.(lod 1 carbody  and some lod 0 details)
I used lod 1 to make a better uvw layout ans save some time.

Yes I know that I can work on those models - only it wont be a bit, I did try this with C1 vette and when I did finish, it was completly new model - but I have something like 3d blueprint so it was a lot easier than I use to.
Please dont get me wrong, Im really impressed all Energien has already done, and I know it was hard to do, only it looks like it need some final touch to be perfect, and very powerful tool...
...I did check this Zmodeler to day, and I know Airone method, I do have my own method too, but non of them is perfect, in fact all of them has the same problem, and it is something with vertices geometry (Zmodeler works similar to Deep Exploration, normals are fine but when U get closer or add reflections we have the same story...)
I dlike to help somehow, only I dont know much about programing, I can only share my 3d modeling experiance

I can use a lot CAD soft so I can measure very precisely vertices deviations if it will helps somehow.
Energien what will U say, can something more be done here ?

and thank U for your time and this tool, seriously thanks a lot U already made this world better place for me.

This is Shelby Cobra, I dont know how it looks in the game, thats why I did ask about close screens few posts a go.
But I do have few years experience with game models now, and it is really hard to believe that this car looks that way in the game for me. I see no point to do those models this way in any game, model can be made lighter without errors, with normal map texture and it will look better cause it will have a correct reflection of the game will run smoother.
I posted example of my work few posts earlier. I hope we can unravel this mystery somehow.

Yeah, the consoles are like mysteries for us.
I cant believe too they look like that in the game.
But if you ask me, the speculair highlights in Forza 3 are the most ugliest graphics ever.
But thats my opinion.
The highlights are way to high.
The ones from NFS Shift looks nice and cool.

I'll search for the screens for that car.
I dont have a console myself, so googling is a good way to go.


[/offtopic]
I wonder about Gran Turismo 5.
In my baddest and naughiest dreams, one day, Gran Turismo Studio for .obj export.
But thats impossible

...back to your GT5 dream, well I have the same dreams too, maybe this mean something  I hope one day ...

I didnt found so close screens from forza but I didnt search to much, it will be cool if U will find any car in such close view, every single mesh I did imported had this problem so is no matter what car will that be, only the best way to check this will be LOD 0 mesh and I dont know are they realy in game, I think they might be used only in menu mode, but I dont know that.

Well its time for GT5 dreams - its midnight here.

And the most close screenshot doesnt have it too:

I'll check it later myself.
But Im very sure they do not appear in the game.
Maybe for menu's or something.

I've watched this development for a while & think forza studio is a great piece of work & appreciate all the work & effort put into it....i'd like to see the track side grow more in it's 
capabilities & really hope you get the motivation to do so.......thanks for the great work done so far.......

Guys how you get your lod0 models in Max ? my models look ok in Max if I don't edit  them  but every time I detach a part, the part gets f**ed    tried all sorts of methods but none of them worked 

It's Sofa King annoying cuz the models are great

Forza 3 Disc one autounpacker (Cars / Wheels)
[http://www.mediafire.com/?5p5zf17v22f2uic](http://www.mediafire.com/?5p5zf17v22f2uic)

Extracts forza vehicles/wheels into seperate folders
Use wordpad - replace function to modify if necessary.

Example bat string.
quickbms -o zip.bms c:\cars\ACU_15_ARX01b_08.zip "c:\Forza Extracted\ACU_15_ARX01b_08"
quickbms -o zip.bms c:\cars\ACU_26_ARX01b_08.zip "c:\Forza Extracted\ACU_26_ARX01b_08"

I googled for a forza autounpacker bat, but could not find one so i made my own, i had to create an empty folder tree otherwise quickbms, would not find directory.

How would i make quickbms automatically create a file named folder for a processed file?
Also does anybody know where to find the scale/position coordinates for wheels? (nvm i found it)

I used SQLite Database Browser
open db\gamedb.slt





I cant seem to find and scale coordinates yet my koenigsegg stock has 19" rims front 20" at the rear
atm the rear wheels look slightly to small.

Hi all
I have a little question for you. Do you plane in near futur to allow us to have tracks textures? Because i only see .bin and bix file for tracks.

Thansk for your answer.

Yes, I actually started working on Forza Studio again a little bit last week and added code to extract the textures from .xds files (much thanks to shadowmoy for pointing me in the right direction), but I still need to look into extracting the track texture data as well as finish up the code to extract all of the track model data.

From what I've seen so far, it looks like the texture data is contained within the .bix files.  I'm not sure exactly what format the texture data is in (and don't know yet why they split each one up into two separate files), but I've outlined the header information below in case any of you wish to look into this any further...

```
0x0	char[4]		'BIX0' file signature
0x4	int			Width
0x8	int			Height
0xC	int			Possibly texture type or level count?
0x10	enum		Texture format (D3DFMT)
0x14	int			Data size of combined .bix and _B.bix files (minus the 28 byte header)
0x18	int			File size of the accompanying _B.bix file
0x1C	byte[]		Texture Data....

```

Hi Ernegien.
Thank you for great tool.

but ...not working.
Why only Debug program?
Please compile in Release mode.

Well, it's compiled as a debug build because that's really all that it is so far.  It's not even close to the point where I can support it as a proper application, and compiling it in release mode will probably not fix the issue you're having anyways.  If I had to guess, I would say you have a relatively older graphics card that doesn't support some of the newer features used during the d3d device initialization (particularly the MultiSampleType, so try commenting that line out first).  I will probably end up having some sort of compatibility mode to choose from, but until then, you could always download visual studios express and try compiling/modifying the project yourself.  It's relatively straightforward and might turn out to be a rewarding experience for you

Hi all, i've a strange problem trying to convert the lods from the Ferrari 288GTO. This is not my first conversion so i'm sure i'm doing all the steps well. I've converted in .obj the carbin file with lod 1-5 using the last version of forza studio, i've imported the obj file on zmodeler 2.2.4 and saved it on gmt because i've to convert it for rFactor. The problem appears when i open this gmt on 3dsimed and only with this car. When i open the gmt, 3d simed doesn't show the car. If i click on edit materials i've all the materials of the car but not the 3d of themodel. I've this problem only with the lods 1-5, cockpit and lod0 works well. I've tried to import the obj on 3d studio max 2010 to export it on opencollada with the settings i used for all the other cars, but i recived this error message: "vertex coordinates too big. adjust object-scale". Any suggestion how to solve the problem ? Thanks in advance. Bye!

p.s: if you need the 3d model, let me know and i will post here the link

Wonderfull piece of software this.

The only problem I experienced is I can't import it to Blender by any means. 

3dsMax if fine so is DeepExploration. but even with opening first with any of these and then expporting with any other format the model still gets messed up.

@3n1g  that would suggest one of two things to me, if the models are working in other 3d programs , then its pretty obvious its not the model ( or forza studio's ) fault. Id say its either , your copy of blender is busted, or you are not converting the models to another format properly.  but it is NOT forza studio thats causing this.  if it was  the model wouldn't work in any program.

id look more into how your converting things or double check your copy of blender maybe its import settings ???

You're wrong Nobby.
I had proven here, by showing screenshots from Forza studio, that mesh problems are already appearing in it.

There are 2 options:
 1) forza models are done bad
 2) forza studio decodes them defectively

@damusto: Forza Studio extracts the car models 100% properly, its Forza 3 models that have errors.   I've been working with Forza models for awhile to other games, ive noticed all errors come from within Forza, I take reference images when doing a mod from Forza and get up and close.

For example:  BMW 2002 Turbo.

Badging is screwed, rear light glass is all bumpy etc.

Very interesting indeed.  Thanks for those reference shots, as they do help to reassure me that the extraction process is as correct as it can be.

Aside from these obvious geometry problems, the other issue that people seem to come across often is that some modeling applications will recalculate new normals after importing the model or before rendering.  This is a problem because the new normals that get calculated are now based off of the lesser precise vertex information so smoothing issues may be introduced.  In order to get the best results, you will need to import these models into a modeling application that preserves the original normals from the file extracted by Forza Studio.

Not a problem, if you ever need more for any reason just ask. 

I have a lot of images like those.

I believe the problems I'm having is with normals, so I guess (actually i'm 99% sure) it's the blender screwing up the normals, since I've worked with the models in Max and with a proper patience to fix one or two mesh problams (model problem as it seems, not extraction) the models are pretty good and workable.

And it isn't my blender only since I've tried 4 or 5 versions (from 2.49b to 2.56Beta and a few builds at GraphicAll and it seems they all use the same or very similar import scripts.

So far I've tried importing from OBJ, DAE DWF and 3ds (figure it wouldn't work since it's all tris anyway) and I still get the messed up normals.


btw, that bmw logo is really messed up, looks like they didn't give a crap about "lesser" cars... Sounds a bit like GranTurismo and I really don't like it...


edit: exporting files and re-importing them in max, fromm those several formats, still keeps the normals intact.

edit 2:

I guess it isn't just the normals, it's the hole mesh that's messed up.

This is a door handle from a BMW M6, the difference is just amazig.

This is a dae file exported with max, and re-open with those two apps. seems it's not the OBJ format that messes up stuff, it's something else.

> Hello,

Templates as in to make livery's? No...

However, if you do a UV render of the material "body" in 3ds max it will render a template for that. The body material is basically for paint and vinyls.    Vinyls go onto the texture nodamage_lod0.  So if you UV render the "body" material make sure its 2048x2048; place that ontop of the "nodamage_lod0" texture and it will match, allowing you to either use that to make vinyls or just use it as a base.


Hope that helps.

Not sure about the track you're looking for, might be DLC perhaps?  As for opening tracks, you should be able to open the entire track zip file from Forza Studio and let it do the rest.

Hello:)

Yea,  in Forza 3 you can drive on the Nordschleife (Northern Loop). Not the Nürburgring GP Track DLC.
I am searching it in Track Folder but there are only:
Catalunya
.
.

but no "Nordschleife" or something else.



How can i open the complete Track with Forza Studio? I only can open single parts of ca. 1000xx exported files.

Thanks a lot Ernegien !!!

Here's my work thx to you 



This car is LOD1 exterior + LOD0 interior/wheels. I've done some mesh surgery, same with UVs which I've projected even better than FM3 creators etc...Get rid of some 'degenerated faces'

2 days of work {16h / day} still now I implementing physics to it, Pacejka etc...

=========================
About tracks

I'm really looking forward to see FM3 tracks in Racer too. Keep it up man, impressive job !

Cheers guys

After 2 years later there will be Forza4.
Forza4 seems to be very high quality game in terms of details.
It will be released in October 11th.

Yeah it looks pretty incredible, I'll definitely be taking a stab at some asset extraction
Awesome!:)

They might release a demo version before the full version.
It could be a month before.
Like they did with Forza 3.

But yeah, it looks very incredible.
It is insane, they have pushed the Xbox360 beyond the limit in terms of graphics and details.

Excellent.   

I just hope they use .carbin again they used it on all Forza games so far.

hey .. is there any chance that you add the forza 1 / 2 support - or is this project done?

i know those games are outdated and lowpoly and so on ... but there are some cars which are no longer available in forza3+4

Volkswagen Jetta, Nissan Altima, Mercedes CLK DTM, Acura CL from Forza Motorsport 1
Proton Motors Spirra, Seat Cupra GT, Chrysler Me Four-Twelve, Acura RL from Forza Motorsport 2
+ some special tuned cars + external parts which are no longer in Forza Motorsport 3

I started adding support for the extraction of Forza 2 car models but was sidetracked before I could finish.  As for the project itself, it's still slowly (I might be able to spend 3-8 hours a week on it) in development behind the scenes.  I've been rewriting things in anticipation for Forza 4, so I may end up squeezing in support for the previous releases if I've got the time.  Regardless, the project is open sourced here as well as on my site, and everyone is free to help out with whatever they can...

It is now one month away for the release of Forza4.
Im damn hyped, the only game thats not so easy with the polycounts like all other racing games.

Turn10 confirmed it will have over 500 cars.
Too bad Forza is only for Xbox360.

Does anyone know when they release a demo?
Some says around 25th.

It seems as if it's already floating around on the internet  so out of curiosity I had someone round me up a sample file.  Upon first inspection, the .carbin model format seems almost identical to Forza 3   I probably won't have much time to look into it this weekend, but be sure to stay tuned for Forza 4 support in Forza Studio

Well, I saw a picture on gtaforums someone already has Forza4 
I asked him but he didnt replied back.

But excellent news

If anyone is interested in digging into this with me, attached is a file containing 254 32-byte vertices of a Forza 4 car.  The vertex format differs from Forza 3, so it will need some decoding.  The overall .carbin structure (at least for the lod0 files) remains relatively unchanged though...

Edit:  Something that came to mind, the Pagani Cinque Roadster is a Autovista car. I noticed in your forzastudio progress that the full modeled engine is not there or is that part of the cockpit LOD0?

Forza 4 has the Cinque Roadster only, Turn10 put the soft top up on it.     The difference with the Cinque Roadster and Cinque (Coupe?) is the air scoop.

I believe you can take it off the Zonda Cinques soft top during Autovista mode (Don't quote me on that)

That is true but even the other cars that you cannot drive in the demo still have their full cockpit file, acting like a full car.    Guess we'll have to wait till the release, I honestly thought as a LOD0 model they would just have it rendering with the car. Guess to save FPS they kept it separate maybe.

Please do not ruin this topic with your questions.
And explaining by step by step is not an option.

And of course the cars render perfectley, I mean Forza Studio for FM3 is perfect.

)
The Cinque Roadster is a removable hardtop. It has no automated folding mechanism to save weight - much like Koenigseggs and all other previous Zondas.
With the top still on the Cinque Roadster, it is not distinguishable from the standard version.

Alright guys, no need to get worked up over things   For an update, I have yet to figure out the scaling method (or possibly my imperfect conversion of their 16 bit fixed-point format to floating point) used in order to generate the models properly.  The missing calculation seems to be per-piece, and would likely take place after the part offsets have been applied to the vertex positions, but that's about as much as I know at the moment.  Each piece does have bounding box information, and I've been trying several different formulas to no avail.  I'll probably be stepping away for a day or two and coming back with a fresh mind in hopes that something obvious will present itself...

i'll update this post in a little bit with the various vertex declaration information.  i have also disassembled the shaders, so i may be able to give some insights on the conversion calculation.  Haven't updated my code for the changes in the carbin format yet though.  And the vertices appear to simply be SHORT4N format, so simply divide by 32767.0f.  The conversion seems similar, but there has been a slight change, but i need to sit down and update my carbin info, so if you have any more info on that it might speed up the process.

EDIT:
Actually seems like it is simply another scale placed in the part position:

fm4 v16
vertexPosition.xyz = (position.xyz * (position.w * pack_partPosition.w)) + pack_partPosition.xyz

instead of:

fm3 v11
vertexPosition.xyz = (position.xyz * position.w) + pack_partPosition.xyz

Haven't tried it yet though.

I won't be able to check this until later tonight but I thought that min/max xyz bounding information followed immediately after the part offsets and no w component was present. You are however correct (or wrong with me :p) about the vertex format it seems.  I'll also try to update this post later tonight with structure info. I do appreciate the input though, hopefully things will get ironed out soon 


EDIT: Below contains a loose layout of the two most important structures in .carbin files.  Also keep in mind that the game reads this as a stream so some components might not be present depending on the counts...

Yeah, that is what i thought too.  i am simply going by what i see in the shader files at the moment.  There are some other calculations using the bounding box offset and scale, that i have not fully worked through yet to see what it affects or is used for.  Since they also have values for morphing between damage states, have to track down the values they are using and see where they fit in.

The fxobj file have both the shader bytecode and the vertex declarations, so it should be accurate in that regard.  But i guess they cannot really show any preprocessing steps that might be occurring in the code.  Unfortunately the carbin format does not have many identifying markers that i can easily search for in the code to find the loading procedures.  Has been a while since i originally worked with the fm3 format, so i will see what i can do.

Stepping away for a bit seemed to have worked this time .  The answer, as it turns out, is quite straightforward.  They've given us bounding box information for each part, so all we need to do is calculate the current bounding information by iterating over each vertex and then figuring out the per-component ratio between the two which will be used to scale it back up to the original intended size.  I somehow had it in my head that they would have stored this scale value somewhere in the part data (they still might, but I can't seem to find it) so they wouldn't need to manually calculate it each time, but I was obviously wrong.  As you can see, I still need to add proper normals among other things, but the hard part should now be over...

And now you already have succeeded to crack the FM4 carbin!
You made history haha.


Energien, I assume the zip of FM4 is the same as the zip from FM3?

As much as I am not Energien. 


I can answer that though, yes the ZIP format is the same as Forza 3. When I looked inside of FM4 cars I just used the zip script for QuickBMS.

Ah, but of course.
I should have known that.
I have read the demo have limited features, so I didn't planned to download the demo.
But you have anwered and thank you

> i'll update this post in a little bit with the various vertex declaration information.  i have also disassembled the shaders, so i may be able to give some insights on the conversion calculation.  Haven't updated my code for the changes in the carbin format yet though.  And the vertices appear to simply be SHORT4N format, so simply divide by 32767.0f.  The conversion seems similar, but there has been a slight change, but i need to sit down and update my carbin info, so if you have any more info on that it might speed up the process.

EDIT:
Actually seems like it is simply another scale placed in the part position:

fm4 v16
vertexPosition.xyz = (position.xyz * (position.w * pack_partPosition.w)) + pack_partPosition.xyz

instead of:

fm3 v11
vertexPosition.xyz = (position.xyz * position.w) + pack_partPosition.xyz

Haven't tried it yet though.

Any notes on the normal format yet? it's not 101010, 1010102, or some of the others I've tried...

Oops, sorry about that.

The new format does not store the normals explicitly.  They store a quaternion representing the orthonormal tangent basis transform.  So i believe you just convert that to a matrix and you will have the row vectors you need for the tangent, bitangent, and normals.

@Ernegien:  Will your Forza Studio use the scale of the models to the same size as FM3 models?   Or will it export the new size FM4 uses?

I would assume that the scale has remained unchanged throughout every release, but if not, I'm sure I could easily make some adjustments...

Well, there's still some things I haven't completely looked into yet.  I haven't mapped out the new header format in its entirety, so right now I'm just specifying a static address in the file to start reading from.  I also briefly glanced at the lod 1-5 carbin format and noticed some slight changes, so I'll need to dig more into that as well.  I'm hoping to have a little free time over the weekend to address some of these things, but as always, I'm not making any promises...

EDIT: Below is a link to download an unsupported version of what I've been working with to research the new file formats.   At most, it is currently only capable of loading the main lod0 and cockpit files, and likely won't load all of them due to minor differences I've yet to find.  The regular lod1-5 carbin file format has changed quite a bit, so I'll need to redo the code for that, but so far it has been pretty simple to manually walk through the file in a hex editor.  To keep it simple, you should be able to open a car zip and it will attempt to load all it can...

I think Ernegien was enough clear about lod1-5.  It doesnt work yet because there is a difference between FM4 and FM3.

Loading lod0 and cokcpit works fine. I didnt try export yet

EDIT: exported, everything ok, but UV map is a big mess so far

Yup exports great apart from the UV Mapping, Good news too, seems LOD0 can be edited without getting all messed up  At least with the models I've tried. And scale is the same as the FM3 models.

Thank you !
That is very nice progress. Indeed LOD0 and Cockpit LOD0 carbin's load fine and can be exported to obj, although without UV mapping it seems. Materials file is being created and seems to be correct. very promising i think 

On a related note, forza 4 ntsc version is available for download now

You both makes it able to for FM4 cars.
I'd like to donate you some money for what you have done!
Really awesome.


And now, I don't know what happened but it seems FM4 full game has been released haha.
Well, actually released on the internet.

Well, it's been known that not all cars will have 3D engines, but there should be around 24 cars, not just 6
Maybe this release that's floating around the interwebs is not the final version...

It's like Gran Turismo 5.
Only around 200 premium cars and 800 no interior.
Any game that has succes, will fail.
How pathetic.

I'm having troubles opening the file, FM4 NTSC XPG.
It's like this file is not a regulair iso.
I tried googling but it seems the programs are not working with this type of iso.

It's like this file is not a regulair iso.
I tried googling but it seems the programs are not working with this type of iso.
Does "WX360" open the ISO?...that's what I use for the XBOX iso's

So, i've tested a lot of forza 4  lod0 and cockpit_lod0 carbin files, so far all of them can be opened and exported fine with forza studio beta version, even the high detailed 'autovista' models, its wonderful. outstanding work from ernegien so far, never thought we could be able to look at these beatiful meshes the day the game is released  Kudos ! now looking forward to fixed uv mapping, and other carbin files, and it will be perfect.

These Autovista models are great!
These are the most detailed I ever have seen.
I don't think these models are by Turn10 itself, I think they are from the names marks.
Turn10 must have bought the license to use their official 3D models.
These details are serious too great to be true.

The Lamborghini Reventon contains more than half milion polies, around 562.786 polies.
And the Autovista models itself cannot be driven in the game,
there are 2 same of them, one for driving and one for Autovista.
That's why there are only 24 Autovista cars.
Depending on the model, some of them makes the Forza Studio lag haha.
And then only the exterior.
In Zmodeler2 I don't have problems with lag, imported the interior and exterior at the same time.

Here are some screens in case of anyone wanna see an Autovista model.

What a big difference and progress.
I start reading from first post to the end of this page.
It began with a messed model file and ends up with perfect smoothing and normals.
And now the Forza4 models imports perfectly in Zmodeler2.
From FM3 to FM4 in a short of time.

All thanks goes to Energien and to the people in the credits of Forza Studio

The Autovista models are located on disk2.
There are 21 Autovista models on disk2 and 3 Autovista models on disk1.
They are located in a zip file called 0004_pri_65.

Zmodeler doesn't have any animations nor it support animations.
The poster who uploaded that screenshot has rotated the doors and trunk.
He rotated them so its looks like it's animated.

About Zmodeler I know. Because I wonder - how in the screenshot, everything is open. Since I have to convert the model of ForzaStudio without animation. You exposed a position of doors manually??

No problem 

And yes, I am aware of that error.
Forza Studio has been developed only for main lod0.
So the other parts, (wheels, rims, rotors, brakes and lod1-5) are still unknown to FS.

Did you know if pivot points for doors, hood and trunk are stored into car_skeleton.gr2 or car_animations.gr2?
With Granny Viewer I can see these are granny2.dll v2.8.40.0 files, refering to an original MAX file (confirmed into versiondata.xml).
By the way no more weired vertex into Max when importing OBJ directly, that's good news!

FM4 models are at right scale (1 unit in max = 1 meter), don't try to use same scale than FM3 models.
You may now correctly place wheels on X and Y axis using PartPosZ and PartPosX into slt file included in db directory, as you can see here:
[](http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/255/53078158.jpg/)
Right front wheel on 97' Lexus SC300 (car number 1351 into slt file) should be positionned at X -0.786 and Y -1,413.

Datas about rims placement and tire sizes are stored into *.slt tables in the 'db' directory, which include for each car lot of settings for the game.
You may easily check them using a SQL viewer/editor.
Previous version of Forza Extractor (7.9.10) didn't get correct scale for model, but last beta (10.7.11) export at good size, because when you move the whells from exact coordinates stored into the table, they perfectlly fit on X and Y axis.
But apparently, they must be somewhere too in this table the scale information for the rims, because for this Lexus rim extracted with Forza Studio is too small.
I will check on some models and try to extract an XLS sheet with informations needed for rims and tires (but nope about autovista animations, which seems enclosed into *.gr2 files).
By the way I hope future version of Forza Studio will be able to open both FM3 and FM4 models at this actual right scale!

what about tyre model position and scale?

Great thing about know where to look for car data info, however I wonder if there is information about gear ratios or torque curve. I found many other data informations for example 0-60, 0-100mph, top speed, displacement, weight distribution, curb weight

I have to check, but I remember when looking for this in FM3, that tires size where stored in format like 240x35x17 somewhere... I will have a look on this this week-end.

OK, I've found them.
Everything for setup tires and rims is stored in "Data_Car".
Check columns "MediaName", "FrontTireWidthMM", "FrontTireAspect", "FrontWheelDiameterIN", "RearTireWidthMM", "RearTireAspect" and "RearWheelDiameterIN".
For Ford Fairlane '64, you get 205x70x15 front and 235x70x15 rear.
For Ferrerari 458 Challenge '11, you get 255x35x19 front and 305x35x19 rear.
And so on.

indeed there is something like that. thanks:) Im still looking for torque curves and gear ratios.

if u move rim and tyre for example like u posted: Right front wheel on 97' Lexus SC300 (car number 1351 into slt file) should be positionned at X -0.786 and Y -1,413.
tyre wont fit the rim, they need some resize I think

I see a very nice progress here . Now I know how can I perfectly set wheels and brakes. I hope that in future Forza Studio will open such data when we import the car then the wheels should appear in correct place.

Im looking forward to fixed UV mapping in forza studio more than everything at this moment. and of course support for more carbin's. I hope ernegien is not too busy this weekend   

Btw, personally I dont think its a big deal to place wheels and brakes manually, but i do think the research that is being done here is very good indeed.

Can someone check if texture coordinates are being properly exported now?  For some reason it's not letting me upload files through the forum, so I'll just throw it on my server again...

Good evening, I'm new here so will start with Hi for now , might introduce myself properly in the near future.

From what I have been able to export of a Fer 599 GTO no the UV maps are not there yet, but this is way different to what I have been using with FM3 .Z3D files stuff through so don't shoot me just yet plz.

I have just exported from Forza Studio (with above supplied files), used FTexextract to get some PNG files for NoDamage, imported to Max 2011, applied PNG all over (I know about subsections for lights ect. so I know this last part is wrong but for the sake of this test...), is this what you were expecting?

Unfortunetly, no, not properly just yet. but it does seem to be a step in the right direction (this is a body/paint material mapping example):

I think this is on of the UV layers. And I think for the chassis it's main UV layer.

@Ernegien: Gave it a shot myself and UV is still not mapping out. I didn't notice a slight change though, if that is worth anything.  



Edit: Slightly stretched I think as its hanging over the texture.

(Click to enlarge)
[](http://img692.imageshack.us/img692/7181/37079716.jpg)


The UV's are displaying properly but are not positioned and sized correctly. I took the UV's that Forza Studio (10.17.11) used, resized and stretched and they do place correctly.


[](http://img695.imageshack.us/img695/848/61246181.jpg)

The only problem, I have seen is the AutoVista models seem to have more UV problems but normal ingame models seem to be fine they just need to be positioned and sized.

@Bregel: Are you using the "forza studio 10.17.11" ?  Because the old Forza Studio had bad UV mapping, I am using the 10.17.11 I can see the mapping but like I have said in my post it just needs to be placed and resized properly. 



Example:  Using the 99 Toyota GT1.



Please note Forza 4 used the same Toyota GT1 model in Forza 3, so it will be very hard to tell each apart in the image.


*Fix I am using a better example image.

Ernegien, see correctly on mapping: it's right, but wrong scale of mapping of some details(like a bonnet)

i think toolieo may be on to something regarding 'normal' lod0 cars and 'autovista' s_lod0 cars (the ones with engines and stuff):

to compare this sls amg, first picture is normal lod0, second picture is autovista s_lod (i did not touch the mapping, to compare):

[](http://www.imagebam.com/image/5397b6154576349) 

[](http://www.imagebam.com/image/e331c8154576466) 

even there are similarities, you can see apart from the extra parts in s_lod0 (engine bay etc) that the mapping on several parts is more off

Tip: Don't attach any body parts with others..  That's how UV mapping goes crazy. Car hoods, some front bumpers, rear bumpers will be over sized and that is what makes the UV mapping look incorrect.

Separate part by part UV's work but they are just out of place and not sized.   

Here is a prime example: *All 3D UV's where separately done.

Ferrari 458 Italia Challenge.






I connected all livery masks by photoshop, to create a template to align each single body UV.

@toolieo : sure I am using 7.9.10 for FM3 and the latest one for FM4. I mean UV mapping like FM3 the final release should be.

So are they exporting correctly now or do you think there's some form of scale being applied to them as well?  I'm also only exporting the first of two texture coordinates, any ideas what the second would be used for?

they do not export correctly. toolieo has edited the mapping manually.

the mapping seems to be 'intact' but the scaling is messed up/doesnt match on most parts (refer to the pictures i posted)

yes, he did it with guidance from livery mask. What about other part which is no livery mask?
Still need some adjustment.

Scale and position are the ones that are missing. My images I have shown is using the proper UV displaying but me manually editing the scale and moving them into correct positions. 

Second UV I would say is bump mapping, I have seen quite a lot of bump maps. Specially for interiors, the interiors use more bump mapping for different leathers etc.

Same thing, if you look at the shape of the UV you can just scale and move manually. It will fit if you take your time.  I remapped car lights and such, infact I was thinking of remapping a whole car just so show.

well, for now its ok to do what you did. But its a lot easier and save time if uv map placed where they should be like the old one. Remapping is another different story and yes you good at it like what you have done in fm3 cars to s2u, I have some of them.

Can someone tell me where can I find Autovista models? I also found that in not every car you can open LOD0 model I got problems with F50 cockpit lod0, I got error: "you slipped one past goalie, please check the error log for more information." I know that it will be fixed but in F40 everything opens so I was just surprised .

There are 26 autovista model, including 2006 Hummer H1 Alpha and 2554 Fictional M12 FAV Warthog, most of them are in disc 2.

I don't think same object may have two mapping coordinates at the same time, even if it is for two different maps (i.e. coordinates A,B,C for diffuse and X,Y,Z for specular). But looking at first coordinates for placement and second for scale factor may be a possibility. A bit weird but why not?

There is one more Autovista model hidden into FM4 standard car pack (Ferrari 412, if I remember, I have to check).

Only a question:

Is there a Forza Studio for FM4 or is it still in development?
If it's in development... go on:D

Yes, there is.

So a pretty pointless question, don't you think?

Good morning to all!

Thought I would take a moment to say hi to all, and say what a fantastic job I think is going on here. Thank you and keep up the good work! I love rendering out the new FM4 cars and can't wait for the UV mapping to hopefully be sorted (I'm a bit too lazy to adjust them myself so I will wait patiently).

A quick question which may have been answered way back, but after skiming through the last 10 pages or so have not found an answer:
Has anybody managed to find any cars on disk 2? I know a lot of the Autovista cars, and a number of standard cars I would like to extract.

Also, I know its not what the development of this software is about but can I make a request about the way the UI works, possibly can when saving a texture or model can it pass through the original file name? This would make usage a lot smoother.

Anyone managed to uncompress the files from these .zip? I get an "unexpected error 0x80004005" from winzip, and winrar says "Unknown method", and 7z "Unsupprted compression method". I'm relatively new to all this, so don't shoot me just yet, but if you did, what program did what program or method did you use to get this working.

You need the Quickbms program and zip.bms.

What do you mean with displaying pics?

The Autovista models are spread over different disks.
There is pack on disk2, the last pack, that is the Autovista pack.
But there are some Autovista models on disk1.
The Mercedes SLS AMG SLOD is on disk1 and one of some of the Ferrari on disk1 too.
I suggest you to look for filenames that contains "slod" or "SLOD"
And on disk2 there are cars too, you can extract the files that has _65_zip_blabla and open them wih wxpirs.
The post of Bregel has explained a lot better and with pictures.
Good luck.

I matched the UV's up on a car.  


*The interior leathers etc are just my custom UV's but the main interior texture (As the heater and button logo's were Forza 4 UV rescaled and moved)




*3dsmax didn't load all textures & properties as I exported from Zmodeler.

Does latest Forza Studio (10.17.11) support rims and tyres extraction?

You don't have to transit anymore via ZModeler before importing into Max. Forza Studio OBJ can be now directly imported into Max.

The error explained itself.
You must install XNA Framework 3.1.
Google it and download the needed application.

Maybe you didn't installed the correct XNA and you maybe doesn't have installed the Framenetwork.

It doesn't matter how many times that has been told.
They keep asking that instead of reading the replies proper.

AirOne has some few pics posted with FM4 car.
Not actually a render but still.

There are only around 26 really high quality cars in FM4.
The rest are just FM3 quality.

I've been seeing a lot of questions recently regarding the functionality of these new builds so I figure I'll pop in real quick and clear up some of the confusion.

In case I didn't make myself clear earlier, all recent "releases" of Forza Studio (newer than 7.9.10) are unofficial builds I've literally hacked together in order to give you something to play with until I have the time to work out a proper version.  I figured this was preferred to no release at all, but I'm beginning to regret this decision.

As for what they can do...I've completely stripped Forza 3 support from them so they should only be able to open Forza 4 LOD0 carbin files (interior/exterior/autovista) at the moment, and I cannot guarantee any functionality, as I've only examined a few carbin files during my development and there are likely special cases which need to be handled accordingly.

I'm unsure as to when I'll get the time to fix UVs or add support for other things, and if there are any other questions, feel free to ask...

Don't worry Ernegien, we appreciate that you posted the WIP versions, really. You will always come across people who dont read carefully enough, or dont understand things right away, anywhere. Personally i'm very glad that we can check out all the new models already, and i thank you for that. 

Thanks for the status update aswell, will wait patiently for the next version.

Hi, 

I've got the FM4 discs, and extracted the second as an iso using wxripper, 
and as mentioned in the topic before it is not recognised as an iso by wx360,
and I get the same error with exiso 2.7  when running it through DOS. When 
I drag the iso over exiso.exe, I get a quick flash of a black box and then it 
disappears, any help on how to extract the iso?

Try Xbox Backup Creator to extract media.
You can download Xbox Backup Creator here:
[http://www.konsolenprofis.de/downloads/ ... hp?id=1499](http://www.konsolenprofis.de/downloads/download.php?id=1499)

Scroll below till you see in red DOWNLOAD.

Good luck.


Ow, there are some files on disk2 wich you need wxpirs to extract the other cars.
They are named like 0001_65_zip.

I tried the xbox backup creator, but I get the same result. This is the log file, and a screen shot below.

====================================================================
Xbox Backup Creator v2.9 Build:0345 By Redline99

Found ODD: HL-DT-ST DVD+-RW GH50N B103 at [D]
   Additional Info: 0008190931A4DK2128
Found ODD:    at [J]

Nero API is not available
ImgBurn executable not found

AP25 cannot locate dae.bin file

Opening Image Browser



I'm not sure if it's the way I extracted the data from disc that is wrong.
 I put in a dual layer dvd in to the disc drive, stopped the spin in wxRipper,
Used a paperclip to manually eject the tray and replaced the disc with the Forza one,
then found the magic number and dumped the data as an iso on my C Drive.

I tried mounting the iso to a virtual drive but it just leads to the same thing as trying to read the disc,
with just a video file saying please insert into xbox.

WxPirs just tells me its not a Pirs/Live! file.

Well yes, you should have known that.
Some of us are only interested in files extraction, so buying and wasting
60 dollars is pretty pointless.

I suppose, I bought the game, because I play it, extracting models for me to see the meshflow and render them in max would just be a plus. 
I'm downloading the limited edition content atm, see if that works and then download the full thing or wait for someone to post the models.

because of lazy noobs now normal users wont get another WIPs to help find bugs

it's not warez topic so i think it's pointless talk about download dvd or so. it's research topic


i found this:

Agreed, but it's doesn't matter how many times we have to say that.
Only new members will ask such question, you know.

And besides, I don't think the Autovista models have lod1-5 since they are only for the showroom.
Energien got rounded up with an Autovista model, the Zonda if I'm not mistaken.
So not regular model, nor the wheels/rims.
That's why the other things hasn't been investigated.

Hopefully this post is clear enough to understand the Forza Studio is not an official and full release.

new users should read some more, not only check pics and look for links. because of their lazyness now we wont try and help in build Forza studio.

I enjoy this tool, it's very great progress so far and I hope soon will be solved problem with lod1-5 models. 
i wish to help, but sadly i know nothing about coding so im kinda useless for Ernegien 

well good luck and take your time

Posting here to say a good luck to Ernegien with wishes that the carbin that has lod1-5 could be openable soon! Here's a comparison I did for the 2011 Taurus SHO (clickable thumbs):
[](http://racingfreak.drivermadness.net/images/forza3_for_taurussho_10_lod0.png)
[](http://racingfreak.drivermadness.net/images/forza4_for_taurussho_10_lod0.png)
Quite similar, but lookig deeper there are some differences and Forza 4's one got more faces. So hope the UV mapping gets fixed aswell

@RacingFreak: Disable the tuning rear bumpers and exhausts, you'd get the same faces as Forza 3.   Forza 4 has a bodykit for the 2011 Taurus SHO but in Forza 3 they didn't. "BumperFB, BumperRB, ExhaustRB, ExhaustLB, SkirtRB, SkirtLB etc"


Just saying, encase you didn't notice.

Yeah, I forgot to disable them, blame me, I will update the picture :/

So basicly the format on the .carbin that has the lod1-5 is really similar?

Check the error log wich has been created when that error has been occured.

Please, check the error log.
It's already explained, post the error log.
Maybe it's because your graphic chip is not good enough for Forza Studio.

I have installed XNA 3.1 on a laptop with Intel chipsets.
It gives me the same error.
So I looked into the error.txt and it told me:

So the graphics device is not capable to run Forza Studio.
I have another laptop and it's equipped with nVidia 9600M GT.
Forza Studio works excellent on it.

because of lazy noobs now normal users wont get another WIPs to help find bugs

it's not warez topic so i think it's pointless talk about download dvd or so. it's research topic


i found this: Code: Select allhttp://www.mediafire.com/?cuoj7ufotl8t4#
is all u need, so u dont have to talk any more about dl game

Sorry and thank you. 

The tool works quite nicely, and I know its just a quick release, however not sure if it's the models or the extraction,
some cars, mostly AV cars have issues with some of the vertex welds, for example the 458Italia, the edge that goes down the side towards the tail lights
is split.

I don't know if that is any help or not, but thanks for the tool!

Here's the main ones, there's more mesh errors, but they might be actual errors made by 
whoever modelled it. This error in the screenshot exists in most models, the area around the fuel cap is quite bad though.
These show up in Forza studio as well, so it's not to do with the exporting of the obj or importing it into max

Edit - it might be to do with chamfered edges, and the smoothing group boundaries have been offset, maybe.

Google suck at finding the pictures, so I found one with forced search options:
[http://www.gamersglobal.de/sites/gamers ... za4/09.jpg](http://www.gamersglobal.de/sites/gamersglobal.de/files/redaktion/Test/forza4/09.jpg)

And a video:
[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSsGa8IePdM](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSsGa8IePdM)

So it must be 3DS Max wich has these bugs.

EDIT

Found a better video:
[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-iKpcZeZUo](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-iKpcZeZUo)

I don't know if my eyes are bad or not but I see the model in the game looks like
it has no welding bugs or what.
So I am very sure it's 3DS Max.
Any obj I import, it has weird welding bugs.
I'll check myself when importing it into Zmodeler2.
I'm sure it wont import with welding bugs.

ye, my bad, simple to fix, just select multiple borders and weld verts at like 0.0001 units.

Although those errors around the fuel pump show up in forza studio, not as seperate elements, 
but, you can see smoothing groups are funny. 

[http://i448.photobucket.com/albums/qq20 ... 1319477939](http://i448.photobucket.com/albums/qq202/panesar/458-1.jpg?t=1319477939)

I'll boot up forza and see if it is in game.

Edit - You can see it very slightly in game, can't really tell that well because of all these reflections, but it's possible that the fuel cap 
is just bad modelling on T10's part.

Edit 2 - Need to import into max using the file's smoothing groups.

Well, if I had an Xbox360 en this game, I would go check the model in the game.

But screw that, we can fix them easily, right?

Alot of (car rip) models I import into Max has unwelded verts in those areas, even non Forza ones. It's easy to fix, but rather annoying.

As for around the fuel cap, this is common with alot of the Forza 3 models, and around door handles etc etc.

When you import into max (I'm using 2010) in the import options select import smoothing groups from file. Comes out clean.

Yup, until you modify the mesh in poly mode. Or export.

Try adding a mesh smooth modifier of 0 and see.

I modified the mesh by cleaning some areas up and nothing happened, if you wanted to add stuff well I don't know.
What is the point of adding meshsmooth mod 0, or even applying meshsmooth to a model, which has been smoothed 
properly. 

Anyways I think we should stop discussing 3ds max modelling in here, the topic is getting off-topic quite a bit now.

Support it. There is no sense here to discuss the max.

very long no news, probably some coding problems or just lack of time

or it's because annoying posts of noobs that made Ernegien upset, so no more WiP stages for test

that problems with normals (lines u can see on model) are because in that place UV map is discontinous.

*Due to PM's*

I brought the DLC and will not hand it out to anyone. Only user I would send a example to would be "Ernegien" if he asked, as it would be used as research purposes. 

Which states why I posted the image it was to confirm nothing was changed from new DLC. Just encase Turn10 decided to do something different.

Of course the DLC models are fine in Forza Studio.
They can't change the engine so they can't have different carbin formats.

American Muscle Carpack works fine too.

Agreed, nothing change in file format. People said that these dlc was there when they release the original one.

Sample pic.


Edit:
For some people who pm me, like toolieo said, we are not talking about sharing files here. Sorry guys, cant help you.

The best thing is Google, clear and loud.

Btw, I'm having great times with the Autovista Revénton.
I used my own textures and mapped them myself.

Energien, may a suggest you something about the second set of coordinates you get for UV mapping?
I don't think it's a scale factor, but a onmap placement coordinates.
When I edit UV map with your last version of Forza Studio, I think that mapping coordinates are correct, but extended on all the surface of the texture, from full top to bottom, and full left to right.
I think that second mapping coordinates you've mentionned indicates the upper left point of mapping, and lower right point of mapping into the texture square (or maybe lower left nd upper right).
I don't know if I'm very precise, so here is an attached picture of what I mean.

Do you see what I mean? Or do I detail my theory?
Thanks for keeping an eye on that.

Is the format of the second set of coordinates like (x,y), with both values included between 0 and 1024 or 2048? Then this should be this...

Interesting, you may be onto something.  Both sets of UV coordinates are within the range of 0 to 1, but the second set seems to be much larger than the first.

I've checked on several models for lot of textures, and each time UV mapping is maximized on texture map, so this second set of coordinates should be the input and output rectangle delimitation of mapping area into the whole square.

It would be awesome if this problem was fixed as I am so desperate of the 240SX model and I barely got time for modeling so I can't mess with the UV-MAP problem for Zmodeler2. Ernegien, your doing a GREAT JOB on these programs, better than anyone else would do it and hopefully you and some other people will come up with an solution. I'm waiting for updates.

@above,

I don't think they work on FM3 models.
You have to use the older versions to open the FM3 models.

You don't have .NET Framework 3.5 installed (or at least not properly). You should reinstall it, or get hold of required .NET Framework 3.5 assemblies. Most (simple) 3.5 apps require only System.Core and System.Xml.Linq. Put them next to the application.

bigBear, sorry, I didn't mention clearly, I tried to open FM4 cars.

mnn, netFW 3.5 wasn't installed indeed on PC2, but after installation the same message appears as on PC1. "Index was outside the bounds of the array."

(Sorry guys for bothering you with my problem, I'm sure this software works fine, I just can't start it up on my system.)

Hi, first of all I’d like to thank Ernegien and all people who worked on this amazing tool.
Keep up the good work!

> Please find attached FM3+4 car list with tires specs and rims coordinates (646 cars without duplicates).

AirOne, I take a look to your file, and I can’t identify every fields.
I guess that 0xyz, 1xyz, 2xyz, 3xyz are the rim’s coordinates, 4xyz maybe a scale factor, but I don’t know what the other values are.
Could you please tell me what is the meaning of each field (0x,0y,0z,1x, ….., 9z)?

edit :
I tested on FM3 R8v10 2010 and i found this :
5xyz : front left wheel's coordinates
6xyz : front right wheel's coordinates
7xyz : rear right wheel's coordinates
8xyz : rear left wheel's coordinates
(invert y and z coordinates into 3ds max)
theses coordinates also work for calipers and rotors


yet don't know what others coordinates are

not tested with FM4 cars, cause last FS only load lod0 and cockpit

Anybody knows how to scale lod0 tyre?

Hello, here I do not think this is the right section, but I did not find answers ...

I want to know which file to edit in the "database" of Forza 3 to install "Spacers" and also change the "WheelStock".

Thank you.

While some knowledge of where to have all this information, I'm interested.

I hope Ernegien finds some free time to continue work on this fantastic project, we're so close already ! If only for uv mapping and/or further carbin file import, i'm quite sure everyone here is sittin on pins and needles waiting for an update !

So here i just post to let you know, we are all looking forward to the next update.

He could be lying, so it could be an FM3 model.
Or he mapped the model on his own.

It's simple to map a car on your own, but we still need to be able to import of the rest of the carbin files to make use of lod1-5 meshes, brakes, discs and so on... 

That impreza is not correctly mapped at all    very poor job

Yeah, mapping is not a problem.
However, mapping the Autovista models are a pain the ass.
I mean, the entire engine in the game looks like plain materials with reflections on them.
But the cables are mapped different, especially the Reventon one.
Too bad the video's on Youtube doesn't show the entire engine properly.
Other than the engines are fine to map.

Sure, you can use my textures.
I see they look really nice on your interior mod

@bigbear, thanks mate

And yes mapping the engine is not the easiest thing to map, but with 3ds max 2012 it takes no time at all.   
I am mapping the F50 autovista model atm. I will post some pics when i have done it.

For some reason the Autovista models are easy to remap.
Tho' they needs some edits like the mapping of the interior leather.
But the interior buttons looks like they have the correct mapping.
Don't know if that's the same for non-Autovista models.

And on the engine, it looks like the mapping has been switched to other objects.
I saw on the video, on sticker at the engine bay has the right mapping.
But when imported and applied that texture, the other sticker got that mapping from other sticker
that doesn't belong there.
It shouldn't be there.

But Turn10 can't map for shit.
The whole engine is plain materials with reflections on it, nothing else.
But ow well, you know how it is.

(last sentence is GTA V quote lol)

Hello fellas...I have to say...thank you to all involved in this excellent program, so glad to see that Ernegien...and everyone else hasn't given up on the development for forza 4 Thank you all !
I read that the speed pack and the classic pack dlc's work fine in forza studio...I am using forza studio 10.7.11....I can only open the cockpits and the lod0 carbins...I am assuming from what i have read in the previous posts that this is normal with this version.

I also am assuming that the texture mapping is also fine?...I looked at the post from Bregel and that also says all is well...and ...looks fantastic...but I am still a bit confused    as I am having issues with the mapping.

Is the mapping correct on the DLC's or did Bregel map that himself ? ...as it sounded the DLC's are the same as the forza 3 models.

Bregel...that 458 is total eye candy    and keeps me up at nite LOL

Can bigBear or Bregel shed a little light on this for me ?  Either I am doing something wrong or I have misunderstood what I have read so far ...as I am feeling very stupid in a sea of intelligent fellas here lol

I am exporting as selective export from forza studio...importing into 3DS max as obj.  export from Max as open collada DAE.
then into simed as DAE...and the mapping is a mess    
this is how i always do my forza 3 models and no problems but I must be doing something wrong?
I have also imported into simed as 3DS..but...same result.

I am trying to get to simed with the mapping intact...is this possible yet ?
From what I read it seems this should be possible...but maybe i read wrong.

Any help would be greatly appreciated....thanks fellas

As you may have read, this tool is still on development for fully supported for FM4 and the author still working on it, what I have done was just remapped with minor misplaced texture map. I wish I can help the author in his daily work, so he have a little time to finish this.

@droid1968,

Don't worry about the UV Mapping.
It seems the Autovista models has a small correct Uv mapping.
I have noticed some objects of interior needs a big scaling.
The UV mapping is still there, but it's needs scaling.
Look for my screenshots of the Lamborghini Reventon few pages back.
As you can see, the leather and stitches are very well mapped.
Before I did that, they were too small scaled.
I had to scale the UV mapping very big to get such results.
However, the engine/engine bay is a complete mess.
It's, it's not done, the worst thing is, buttons textures are needed for the engine??
I don't know, some UV mapping looks like overlapping.
Anyway, I don't know but Turn10 can't map the engine for shit.

But, as you might have known, there are always a few people who can do better than Turn10 itself 

Just don't worry about the programs/tools.
Forza Studio is not the final release.
We should be very very glad we can import FM4 models.
Since FM4 is released, there are really nice new cars, wich FM3 doesn't have.

Hats off to Energien

I'm very interested in the file format as I see a relationship to other Games I do work with.
Did the early versions have granny2.dll or anything like that?

Yeah I know they use granny as there are references to it in the executable.  I can't remember if it was included as a standalone library or linked with the game though.  I also don't know anything about the format itself to tell you whether or not that's what was used to store their car and track model information.  I was under the assumption that it was a custom container format, but I could very well be mistaken...

Thanks, would you mind telling everyone what was changed?  I'm assuming it most likely dealt with the MultiSampleType or some other presentation parameter.  I can't wait to finally give this thing the proper rewrite it deserves

The format of the files can be highly modified with the Granny system. That's what makes it so difficult to figure out from one game to the next at times.
So you could be working with a modified form of the gr2
That's what interests me. It may be a variation I've not looked at before.

I don't learn C# and XNA.
Please read on to know it.

The source code remains two problems in "ForzaStudioForm.cs".

1. MultiSampleType (it's not important)
You set two MultiSampleType.
But video card is used with various type,
so you need to get and check user anti-aliasing support by C# function.

2. UpdateCamera function (it's serious)
Running Forza Studio in Debug Mode,
an error "NullReferenceException" appears in "UpdateCamera()" function at
"Camera.Update()", "be.View = Camera.View" around them.
You should avoid this error in some way.

In my quick fixed case, delete "UpdateCamera" and that code includes in "MainLoop" directly, and so on.

That error is probably because of shader version on your PC.
Your video card is less of pixel or vertex shader version.

I don't think that is a problem of the PC or of the my scheda video because I've tried on other two PC and I have the same error

Thanks for the reply Big bear....i too see that it is a scale issue also with the body...sadly I am not proficient at mapping or scaling   
I have been playing with zmod a bit and also 3DSmax and trying to learn it is the one thing that holds me back in my modding hobby for GTR2
and I also agree there some VERY talented hobbyists in the community   
I eagerly await the finished forza studio so I can then get my mits on the rest of the LOD models as I will need the lod1 and lower models for GTR2.

What Energien and the other fellas are doing here is wonderful work    I watch this forum all the time to see the progress you all accomplish here...again fantastic work fellas...I wish i could help but i no nothing of what you all do with code   

I agree Big bear ...there is soo many nice new models in Forza 4 the 2 458's in the DLC's are my faves.

Please keep up the wonderful work on this program...you all have made it possible to convert some beautiful cars to our favorite games and for this a whole community of modders thanks you

Don't bump this topic with useless sense.
You should read posts of Energien.
Programming/coding has never been an easy task and it gives very lots of pain the butt and head.
Just be patience, X360 coding is like coding on an entire NASA reverse-engineering crap.

First off all, welcome to the forum.

To extract .iso, you'll need:
[http://konsolenprofis.de/downloads/download.php?id=1499](http://konsolenprofis.de/downloads/download.php?id=1499)
Scroll down till you see the red Download.

As you see, this topic has lots of pages.
FM4 is just a few months out and there hasn't been figured out the most things.
The only thing that are supported are the lod0 models.
That's all, the other big problems are the UV-mappings.
On some models, like Autovista, the UV-mapping is a bit right, but it needs huge scaling.
And other models, like the normal models when racing, have screwed up UV-mappings.
The only thing to fix the mapping is doing it ourself.
But as you see, the models contains lots of objects.

About the circuite textures, you can try this:

The last pages this topic is getting filled up with these new noobs asking for how to extracting iso's
and crazy old bumps when importing an FM 3/4 model.
Just read the thread before you motherfucking post!

@Pfreak, you are almost two years or so to ask that question.
See that bold font, read it and use it.

Maybe the first post should be updated?
I don't even know if there's an import/export script.

Presumably there is cause pfreak has imported it with "bumps and crazy meshes"

Ernegien has put his site on profile which contains very usefull information and tools.

But for Forza Studio to extract Forza models to obj:
[http://codeescape.com/2010/11/forza-stu ... -xbox-360/](http://codeescape.com/2010/11/forza-studio-forza-3-carbin-resource-extraction-tool-xbox-360/)

If you get these crazy bumps and meshes, it's either your 3DS Max version or something else.
Importing in Zmodeler2 there are no problems.

Oh Boy, sorry bigBear for asking a question. It wasnt an offense, just wondering if there was a proper solution or not. Is this the wrong section to ask? I couldnt find a better place. Correct me, if i am wrong.
And i still couldnt find a perfect way for smoothing the 3ds files in Max, so they come out real clean and smooth.

Hey everybody, thank you for reading my post.

I have been a loyal follower since extracting Forza 3 models and have never really experienced any problems at all, until Forza 4  

I just cannot get Forza Studio to work on my computer?! I have tried: Forza Studio 7.9.10, Forza Studio 10.17.11 and even Forza Studio 5.29.10 and I get the same boring error message every time?! Just to difuse any trollers who are bored and want to argue... I have searched extensively through this forum and Ernegien's main site [http://codeescape.com](http://codeescape.com) (including the 39 comments) and haven't found any solution to this at all?? It looks like Ernegien hasn't been in here since the end of December, so I was hoping there might be someone else who could kindly help?

I get the following error message:
"You slipped one past the goalie! Please check the error log for more information."

Okay.. so I've checked the error log and I get this:

System.InvalidOperationException: An unexpected error has occurred.
   at Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Graphics.GraphicsDevice..ctor(GraphicsAdapter adapter, DeviceType deviceType, IntPtr renderWindowHandle, PresentationParameters presentationParameters)
   at ForzaStudio.ForzaStudioForm.CreateDevice()
   at ForzaStudio.ForzaStudioForm.MainLoop()
   at ForzaStudio.ForzaStudioForm.Form1_Shown(Object sender, EventArgs e)

   at System.Windows.Forms.Control.InvokeMarshaledCallback(ThreadMethodEntry tme)
   at System.Windows.Forms.Control.InvokeMarshaledCallbacks()

I'm pretty sure it's my graphics card that's causing the problem, but what is the solution? I have installed everything needed to run the software (all necessary .NET Frameworks and XNA Framework 3.1) and have no problem with the older version of Forza Studio for Forza 3 models?

Any help or a solution would be very much appreciated!

Thank you for reading...

@Pfreak, no offense or anything else.
You see, this topic is the most popular topic on the entire Xentax site.
Lots of us has the problem you mentioned.
But it's somewhere else in the middle of this topic, when FS got released to test them out.
Some 3D apps have problems with the crazy bumps and meshes.
But in the end FS has been fixed, after all, it was not FS which caused these crazy bumps and meshes.
It depends on which 3D app you are using.
Zmodeler2 imports the FM models very fine without these bumps.

But, GTAInside is fullfilled with FM converts lol

And Diatribal, I'm very sure you have an Intel GMA chipsets.
Am I right?
If that's so, there is no way to import and export FM models

Hey BigBear, many thanks for your kind response!

My graphics card is:
Mobile Intel® 915GM/GMS,910GML Express Chipset Family (I know, I know.. I need a new computer!)  

The only thing I am slightly curious about, is that I have been able to use previous versions of Forza Studio with Forza 3 and export FM models with no problems whatsoever? Is there really that much difference between Forza Studio for FM3 and Forza Studio for FM4?

Thanks again!

Could be a graphics card issue or possibly even an invalid XNA installation (or wrong version) but I can't remember the difference in exceptions thrown at the moment.  You say you were able to get previous builds running fine?  Are you using the same hardware as before to run it?

Hey Ernegien!

Wow! What an honour to have you respond! Thank you very much for your time! I must congratulate you on such an awesome piece of software and say how grateful I have been for being able to export my favourite car models into 3ds Max!

Yeah, using exactly the same setup as previously and I can still export carbin's to OBJ's with no problems at all (using Forza Studio 4.20.10). On a side note, I have never been able to see a preview of the 3D 'carbin' (object) in either the 'Viewport' or 'Information', but that didn't matter to me as I only needed to convert the carbin to an OBJ file. Once I had the OBJ I was able to import it into 3ds Max (2011) with no problems at all.

There shouldn't be a hardware problem if I was able to successfully export carbins from Forza 3 should there?

Thanks again for your time and response...

Hey, thanks again for the kind advice Ernegien. This copy of Forza Studio (ForzaStudioFM4.zip) worked fine!  

I know it's only a beta at the moment but just thought I'd let you that I still couldn't see a preview of the object in the viewport window (more likely to be my crap computer than Forza Studio itself!), but was able to successfully export a carbin file (Autovista Aston Martin) to OBJ. Just imported it (or part of it at least) into 3ds Max 2011 and it's working fine!

Many thanks for your help and advice Ernegien, I grately appreciate your time and dedication to this awesome project!

Thanks for the latest FS 3 & 4 compilation, it finally works loading new FM4 cars & stuff !

More of my recent work :

[Atzara](http://www.racedepartment.com/forum/threads/atzara-track.35408/)
[FreeHand](http://www.racedepartment.com/forum/threads/freehand-track.35177/)
[Avernaz](http://www.racedepartment.com/forum/threads/avernaz-track.33298/)

About those missing FM4 LOD levels, any news for when you projecting at getting them into your new FS 4 ?

I should really use them in Racer, as Ruud has implemented such feature, it's just I'm so lazy of redoing the same for > 2 levels, sure it becomes easier going up in levels, hehe, but idk, it should be the inverse, more shader sided systems (DX/OpenGL) & GPU algorithms improvements to handle 'on fly' smart meshes tessellation, imho.

I've never come across a car I couldn't import from FM4 from the very first release of FM4 Studio.  Not sure what you experienced.

First of all big thanks to Ernegien for all his hard work.

I'm wondering if someone could test extraction of Suzuki SX4 Pikes Peak from one of the dlc sets. The cockpit works fine but the body was no go. It's the only one I've come across that gives a error. Also the Focus ST 2012 (I think it's in the same dlc) seems to export fine but is missing the bumpers, though I need to retest. I normally wouldn't bore you with this but I thought it may be beneficial to the research.

Yes dodgy i've noticed the same thing, also on the Hyundai Veloster DLC. I'm sure Ernegien will address that issue when he has time for the 'proper rewrite' he mentioned before, i dont think the problem is on our end.

Is your processor an Intel 740M or something?
I have  a shitty laptop with the exact same Intel chipsets as you have.
God, SA runs awful on that shit, all has to be very low than possible lol

But I moved on to a much better nVidia 9600M GT, so my SA would run FM4 Autovista models without any problems.
However, I have betrayed my left hand to leave that shitty laptop with Intel chipsets haha!

Ernegien, nice you made a fix for incredible bad videochips.
I nearly throwed my bad laptop in a bin of trash

I guess being able to export models from one game that has a bunch of cars and into another game that has a bunch of cars is relevant.

I'm sure some people would like some different cars to crash into walls with.

The .bix format seems to have changed in Forza 4, so those are currently unsupported until I get the chance to look into it further...

Ernegien, any news about the second set of coordinates for texturing?

Could you please provide us an extraction of this set for body mapping on a car common for both FM3 and FM4 (i.e. 1997 Acura NSX), in order to find a way to scale and place the mapping on texture and compare the result with the coordinates set?

Do you need FM4 1997 Acura NSX for this test (acu_nsx_97_lod0.carbin)?

Tell me, I can post somewhere both lod0 for FM3 and FM4 models.

Thank you for all work still done!

Hello everybody! awesome site, awesome tools! 
ive been going crazy over forza models (some are over 800k polies!)
but im probably really stupid and i cant find where to get the carbin files!
iv found a russian website where u can download them one by one but 95% of the zip archives are corrupt!
ive tried to download forza 4 xbox360 and extract it but i get files named like string files with no extension! so i have no idea what file is it and how to extract it 
please help me!
so ever i was able to extract on work on some models like the f355 the gt500 428 and the quality is too intense!
i would be very thankful for any help or answer

I've already fixed it on my end  The header magic changed from BIX0 to BIX1 and they started using a few different linear D3DFMTs to store their textures.  Forza studio will be capable of extracting track textures

That's good news; but are you making any progress concerning the rest of the vehicle carbin files ?  Afterall, we can always map the models ourselves as required, but getting the other meshes is another thing

Those are the files, just extract it and you need another extractor called wxPirs to browse and extract those files.

white00gt, read the file more properly.
You are trying to import an unknown file extention.
Maybe you are trying to import a car that's still not supported.

mus001, read the topic, you'll find your answer.

I suggest a moderator should close this topic untill Ernegien has something to say.
He can always pm a moderator to unlock his topic.
It's kind of useless since any new member is asking the same questions as 2 years ago.
They are not bothered to read the damn thread.

it is pointless to lock this thread, just ban or warning the ones with annoying questions lazy to read the topic. There are

already all necessary informations and guides in the topic, no problem to extract or import anything


put info and link for each version in first post would help as well

Time to post some rare happening here.
I've been editting the Reventon engine of the Autovista version.
Like all FM4 models, the UV got screwed up, so I re-mapped them.

Here some screenshots:

What software are you mapping in? It looks like zmodeler. I'm working in C4D without much success on the autovista models. The scaling is wayyyyy out. All the other models are fine to remap.

I heard that its possible to restore mapping through 3DS Max 2012. As its says on their website, lots of features have been added and updated in UVW Map but i have no clue how to do that. I really hope some of you will come up with some useful ideas!

I dont think they can , because this problem occur when exporting. the uv coordinates not placed properly in exported obj. while all 3d program read this obj file.

Hello, my name efrem.
 I wanted to thank you for what you are making, and work, by real teachers.
 I have a question for you: how do I extract the cd fzm4?
 with "xbox creator", but 'always wrong.
 I have the original CD and also downloaded one but to no avail.
 I am converting machines "FZM3" and I'd like to try "FZM4".
 Thank you in advance, and sorry for my English.

I used zmodeler to fix the mapping on the forza 4 cars i converted .. with the last studio version ernegien posted, it's easy to just select old mapping and fix it from there (only requires some scaling/moving) .. for the bodywork i generated new mapping manually, the lod1 i made in 3ds max from the lod0

if you know how to map in zm2 its not hard really, only takes some time 

the last studio ernegien posted essentially exports correct mapping, its just out of proportions .. so you dont really have to create new mapping, only needs to fix it

Bregel i will not wask you to share the remaped file from the r18 because i´m a careful reader    but please, i would like to know how did you fix the uvmap so quick?

I´m working on the 458 GTC and manage to fix it, in 4-5 days, now my question is simple, could you help me on something, your tecnique for instance, what tecnique do you use on 3d max to put everything on place so quick?! 

And apart of the textures you can export, from forza, you need to use other to map some missing texture to, am i right? Yes of course..... but my main question is, are you a pro of max or do you have a lot of free/spare time to play with the models?

I´m working on the 458 GTC and manage to fix it, in 4-5 days, now my question is simple, could you help me on something, your tecnique for instance, what tecnique do you use on 3d max to put everything on place so quick?! 

And apart of the textures you can export, from forza, you need to use other to map some missing texture to, am i right? Yes of course..... but my main question is, are you a pro of max or do you have a lot of free/spare time to play with the models?
Completely agree with the above. That would help a lot of us here.

@smokey, i know that i can do it manually. Man ,but i dont feel like spending 3 damn days without eating or drinking just to get 1 Autovista model done. 
Also, i have found a video explaining all the new stuff that has been added to Max's UV Unwrap. [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rL6sJA1BWAo](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rL6sJA1BWAo)
I tried to work with it but showed no results for me.

why no eating and drinking ? i dont follow .. if you dont want to put some work into it, you cant fix it . there is no magic 'fix uv -> done' tool. 
wait for ernegien to post a new version then, in case he will ever return ..

and btw, 3 days is a joke. few hours for lod0 and another few hours for cockpit .. back in the day we would've killed to get our hands on quality meshes like these, nowadays all i read is 'bohoo i have to put in work myself wawaa' ..

nope i dont see it, all i see is that you are too lazy to map a model

maybe we can get back to topic now ?

so that everyone understands: only way to fix mapping is manually edit it, or wait for new forza studio.

If working with UV mapping is so hard, there is a simple solution. Stop trying to run up a mountain and learn to walk first.. this is obviously WAY over your head, so go back to basics. Read the manual for whatever program you have and learn how to work with UV mapping better. THEN when you have more experience try using it on something like this.

"I want to be a boxer, so rather than learning how to box and then fight some little guys first, im just gonna jump right in and pick a fight with mike tyson"  
Thats a dumb idea... Learn to walk before you learn to run. UV mapping isnt hard to do, you just need practice/ experience and thats something you DO NOT have yet.

LOL at the bold sentence!
Yeah, pretty much agreed this.
Mapping lots of stuff is not easy, but fuck that, no anything is easy!

So I just go straight and find that damned dragon telling that animal to fuck off

So I've been playing around with some models, using LOD0 from FM4 with other LODS from FM3. After readjusting the mapping on the FM4 LOD0 mesh, I though I might try transfer UV mapping from FM3 LOD0 to FM4 LOD0. 
I did this and all was fine, until I exported. Then the bad normals from FM3 LOD0 meshes appeared. But if I remap manually they don't.

So it seems that the bad normals from FM3 LOD0 have something to do with the UV Mapping? I don't know, just putting this info out there incase the same issue comes up in FM4 Studio if any more is done to it.

Hey there everyone!

Apologies in advance if this question has already been answered before and I wasn't able to find it in the 82 pages of posts here...

How do you guys get the UV Maps into 3ds Max? I converted a model of FM4 and there were no UV Maps. Or does it only work on FM3 models? Would be great if someone could point me towards the right direction...

Cheers!

You have to have some knowledge in 3d max to be able to edit the UV, the main feature you must use is in "modifiers" » "uvcoordinates" » "unwrap UVW"

You have a lot of toturials in youtube etc....

After successfully putting together a nice Aston Martin from Forza 3, I tried rendering the whole thing in Maxwell. Suddenly all the normals went crazy. I've read some posts earlier that there were issues with the normals when importing into 3ds Max but the model looks fine inside my 3ds Max viewport. All nice and smooth... Just when rendering it with Maxwell I get really bad results. Does someone know a way to fix this? Or how to "freeze" the geometry so that other renderers don't mess it up?

Hi, does anyone know how to extract 2d dvd of Forza 3 and use it files the right way? I could extract 1st one with Noesis and use files with FM Resource Extraction, but 2d dvd haves some other files in Content folder and they all are about 450mb+

Or it hasn't been researched yet? Files are slight different and no zip's like in 1st dvd, it includes Fujimi Nurburg Amalfi and car packs..
I would really like to have Fujimi circuit 3d model, if anyone haves it.. Please send it to my email: [just_dre@hotmail.com](mailto:just_dre@hotmail.com)

These 450mb+ files are DLC files, extract them and then open them with [wxPirs](http://gael360.free.fr/wxPirs.php) to extract the content from them .. it all has been discussed in here before. multiple times.


On another note, i think it's safe to assume that there will not be a new forza studo version, at least not anytime soon. it took ernegien only a few days to add support for forza4 lod0 files. now after 5 months no progress at all. 

clearly he is busy with more important things, so let's just wait until he posts again. There is no need to ask "any news ?" all the time, there are no news. there wont be news until ernegien posts some news.

At the topiccreator,
I think it's better to post the source code of the UV mapping.
It's very long time now and always still the screwed up UV mapping.
The mesh itself has been investigated very fast within few days or less but the UV mapping problem still remains screwed up.
So why not posting the UV map source code so maybe someone with experience can take a look at it and fix it.

Can somebody help me extract remaining cars from forza 4? I was using exiso and wxpirs to extract things from dvd1, dvd2. autovista and dlc, but still I don't have some cars. For example I can't find Ferrari FF which I want to convert to another game.

EDIT:
I think I got it.

Hey!

I know these kind of questions seem bothersome for some of you, but I have a similar problem as the previous post. I have looked through all folders of disc one and two of Forza 4 and I can't find the BMW M5 2012, neither the Aston Martin DB9... I haven't had any problems finding most other cars.

So if one of you could tell me where they are hidden, or if there is a special technique to access them - I would be very thankful.

Cheers!

Actually, my problem was silly. I didn't know that Ferrari FF is called F142 in forza  .

Looking up to your issue, I think you have not unpacked all.
After extracting things with exiso, there are some packages to extract, especially on DVD2. They are in folder "content", 4 files called for example "4d53091000000001". You have to open them in wxpirs, extract, then extract newly unpacked big zip files with bms script. Inside those zips you will find missing cars and much more. Good luck.

Thank you very much for the quick answer! 
The wierd problem is that only the cockpits are not extracted the lod0.carbin of each one has no problems at all.
The cars that I'm having problems are:
ACU_66_ARX10b_08
ACU_66_JHARX02a_09
AUD_2_R8_06_
AUD_2_R15TDI_09
BMW_15_LMR_99
FER_F50_95 This one the SLOD was extracted without problems
PAN_11_LMP_03
They are not too much if I found someone more I´ll let you know.
If you need one of my files I can upload it and send you the Link by PM if it is Ok with you.
Thanks again for the quick answer.

Please let me know exactly which cars you're having trouble with and where they are located within the game files and I'll see if I can take a look...

This means you back on track? I realy would like be able to extract the other lods from F4, the uv map to but i think the other remaining LODs are a must have!!

The wierd problem is that only the cockpits are not extracted the lod0.carbin of each one has no problems at all.
The cars that I'm having problems are:
ACU_66_ARX10b_08
ACU_66_JHARX02a_09
AUD_2_R8_06_
AUD_2_R15TDI_09
BMW_15_LMR_99
FER_F50_95 This one the SLOD was extracted without problems
PAN_11_LMP_03
They are not too much if I found someone more I´ll let you know.
If you need one of my files I can upload it and send you the Link by PM if it is Ok with you.
Thanks again for the quick answer.
Made a few changes and it appears to be loading the two that I've tested.  Please let me know if there are any LOD0/SLOD/cockpit models that this won't work with...

Looks like I'll be needing someone to upload that HUM_H1Alpha_06_SLOD file as I only seem to have the non-SLOD version available.  I also don't have the Hyundai Veloster turbo 2012 mentioned above either.

This one should support all Forza 4 SLOD, LOD0-5, cockpit, rotor, and caliper .carbin formats.  If you find a vehicle it does not work for, please let me know.  To all those bitching about texture support, I'm well aware that they are messed up, so stop bitching

Hello all, I did not quite understand the response of ernegien because my English is very low, in fact what he means as in the new forza stuido we can extract all elements of the car (cockpit body ...) About textures and he said that there is no problem with the new studio forza is that correct?

Yes, we can import all elements such cockpit, body, brakes and rotors.
About that texture problem, I assume it's still not fixed but he is aware of that.

LOD0 wheel extraction should also now be supported.  LOD1-5 wheel models appear mangled and likely always will as I don't care to look any further into those right now...

This was the same situation in Forza 3...only the Lod0 wheel was good in the (Lod0) Wheel carbin file.  This is not a problem, because we can get the Lod1-5 wheels from the carbin file that provides us the Lod1-5 vehicle models.

This is great news that we can now open LOD1-5 meshes, thank you very much. About the mapping problem, it is not such a big deal to edit the UV Mapping ourselves.

Here is my suggestion:
I've been looking into the texture scaling issues and am in need of some help on how to view the UV maps in a modeling program such as blender or 3ds.  If someone could point me in the right direction with a quick tutorial it would be much appreciated

For 3ds it´s easy, import the object, go to "Modifiers" tab, dont forget to select the object first! 
[](http://img338.imageshack.us/i/sem1.png/)

Scroll down until you find "UV Coordinates" in the sub menu chose "Unwrap UVW"
[](http://img819.imageshack.us/i/sem2h.png/)

Now, it will appear a new window in your right side, clic on "edit"
[](http://img843.imageshack.us/i/sem3b.png/)

A new window will open, from now on the editing will be happening in this window, you will be able to adjust the uv and do everything you need to see there.
[](http://img217.imageshack.us/i/sem4.png/)

i tried to go straight to youe concern, hope you understand my mini tutorial!!!!

Thanks for the quick tutorial gpfan, it was exactly what I needed to start looking into this stuff.  After spending a couple of hours ripping my hair out this morning I think I've finally figured out the UV scaling formula.  Each carbin sub-part contains separate UV X and Y scale factors and offsets in the header, among other data I have yet to make sense of.

I'm currently only extracting the first set of UV coordinates, and I've only tested this on the body sections of a few vehicles, so it may still need a bit of work.  Please try it out when you get the chance and let me know what's still missing...

@ Ernegien

I just did a quick check of a random car (Lod0) and all of the mapping seemed correct for headlights/taillights, interior, steeringwheel, wheels.  Looks like you're on the right track.  

Edit: the mapping for the exterior (body) seemed fine, too

First off I want to thank you Ernegien for your hard work and patience on this program.   

I've tried the latest version, I see you fixed the mapping..I tested the mapping on wheels and body parts and it works flawlessly..thanks for that, we were really missing it.  

Although lower LOD wheels don't work yet..



I hope you will fix it soon.
Thanks for your effort.

http://codeescape.com/temp/FM4Studio_Al ... -12_v2.zip

As stated in a previous post, this is a known "feature"  and will likely never be fixed as I don't care to waste the time looking into it when you have a lower resolution wheel model in the vehicle carbin file.  If there's enough of a demand, I may change my position, but I doubt that to be the case...

So as You wanted to hear about mapping, well I exported Subaru Impreza 05 and I must say that mapping is 100% correct, didn't noticed any errors. I think that we can say that Forza 4 car import is done.

@Smokey
I didn't know that, thanks!   

@Ernegien
According to Smokey's post, we don't need it fixed anymore..I didn't know lower LOD wheels are also in main body .carbin files..
Thanks for fixing the UV mapping Ernegien! I guess this case is closed! We should wait for FM5 now.

What a great Easter surprise! Thanks so much Ernegien!

Just another question regarding the textures: Have you noticed that the textures from Forza 4 look way darker than the ones from Forza 3? The details on the texture for the undercarriage are barely visible on the texture extracted from Forza 4, for example... Any thoughts on this?

Cheers!

This one makes me keep pull my hair out of my head.
It seems the engines of Autovista models are just....plain plastic, metals and reflections.
I really don't know why there are engine textures if they are unused.

I still have problem with digitalGauge-textures. There are no UVs as it seams. All other textures are working fine. But Speedo-textures and so on do not work. Tried in multiple cars. Also tried with autovista models. Anyone else has this problem?

Edit: and one other problem. What about the rims? If you take the one exported with the modelMesh, its too small. If you take the extra Rim from "wheels", its too big. Can someone tell me what is the correct factor to scale it down? I dont want to the rims to look good and fit, i want them to be accurate. Also rotors and calipers are too small. Can anyone help with this issue? Thank you

I'm here begging for help. I've followed this thread for a long time but was never able to get Forza Studio to work for FM3 and finally gave up. Now that the newest version is out for FM4 I'm still in the same situation and I know it's ignorance on my part.

I have 3.5 .NET framework installed, I also have 4.NET framework installed, no idea if that creates a conflict. I have XNA 3.1 installed. I'm running Vista 32 with an AMD 2.6 dual core and an 8800 GT updated to the most current driver. I've tried with UAC on and off with the same end result. It is possible that I may have disabled some windows services in the past but I went through and turned back on most of what was stopped.

I've taken the most recent link for ForzaStudio and downloaded the zip, unpacked it and placed it in a folder on my C drive. There were 4 files. I double click the application icon and get the message that ForzaStudio has stopped working.

The error that's showing when I look at the windows report is:
Problem Event Name:	CLR20r3
Problem Signature 01:	forza studio.exe
Problem Signature 02:	1.0.0.0
Problem Signature 03:	4f788771
Problem Signature 04:	Forza Studio
Problem Signature 05:	1.0.0.0
Problem Signature 06:	4f788771
Problem Signature 07:	5a
Problem Signature 08:	189
Problem Signature 09:	System.NullReferenceException

Can anyone help me figure out what I'm not doing correctly or what I need to do? Please assume I'm an idiot. Thanks.

Forza studio does not support the importing of any model in-game, if that's what you're talking about.

It should make no difference to the game what the actual size of the wheels are, as it just calculates the bounding box dimensions of the current model and scales appropriately for the desired wheel size.  The same is most likely true for calipers and rotors, which will need to vary based on the wheel size.  I'm assuming all of this information would be stored in their SQLite database file per vehicle.

well, i dont use the model in a game. but then i will try find a solution for myself.

But what about the gauge-textures?

Not sure.  Are you matching up the correct ones?  I believe the LOD0 models have a separate interior texture it uses instead of the standard nodamage one.

Model lod0 = nodamage_lod0.xds
Cockpit Lod0 = interior_lod0.xds , gauges uses interior_lod0.xds
Lights lod0 = lights_lod0.xds
Lod 1/2/3/4/5 = nodamage.xds - interior.xds - lights.xds
Wheel Lod0 = wheel_lod0.xds
Wheel Lod1/2/3/4/5 wheel.xds
Tire only on lod1/2/3/4/5 but in some cars is deformed the tire and the tires for wheels upgrade the same

energien : i know the fast that forza studio can't export directly the 3d models for every kind of game.i know the way for put forza models on others games and we need the import of lod 1, lod 2 etc etc etc like you made with/for the forza 3 game.
so ,the question is : the last release of forza studio alpha can import all the lods of forza 4 , or only the lod 0 ??

Oh ffs why dont you just try it ?  Yes, every LOD works now ! Every mapping is fine ! Everything is good now ! Yay !


About digital gauge: These are unmapped blank spaces where the game draws - you guessed it - the digital gauge. Ernegien cant fix anything about that because the space isnt mapped in the first place. Solution: Make your own texture and map it for the blank space (btw this was exactly the same in forza 3 ...)


I've tested the last forza studio release thoroughly, and everything seems to be fine. Every LODX, cockpit, wheels (except lod1-5), calipers, discs, everything exports and is mapped just fine. You rock Ernegien !

I would like to thank energien for the hard work he has done to make this app, both for FM3 and for FM4.

Small question - where can I find the brake caliper textures (if they have separate textures)?  I have looked in the shared.zip but they don't appear to be there.


Thank you.

Thank you.

Mostly they are stored in "Nodamage.xds" same texture as car uses it.

Hmm OK thanks.  The car I'm trying to find them for (1980 Lotus Esprit Turbo) must have black ones then, they come out black when I use the nodamage.xds texture.  Doesn't really matter anyway as you can't see them behind the wheels anyway.

If You got some problems with recognize them just search in Google images ( I mean the car name), and see how they looks in Forza game, if they got different color than black, then try with other texture. 
Good luck with your mod.

Hi, as i see u've managed to get Forza tool even more greater!
Btw, does the latest version also supports tracks/circuits from Forza4? Or could u please fix some Forza3 tracks properly ( what i mean is that models aren't correct when importing to max, where are many poly's like on rock surfaces are pretty messed up aswell as roads and fences some of them missing - ( Fujimi Kaido and Amalfi GP have those problems alot, other not mutch but still have few of them bugs )
Anyway nice to see that u've able being updating your tool Emergien

For what it's worth, I tinkered with anything I could find to tinker with. In right clicking properties on the application icon I saw a compatibility tab and changed it to Windows NT 4.0 (service pack 5) from XP SP2. After doing that I run the application and get "application has generated an exception that could not be handled. Process ID=0xfd8 (4056), Thread=0x630 (1584) Click OK to terminate the application. Click cancel to debug the application".

If I do hit cancel there I get "No registered JIT debugger was specified. Click on retry to have the process wait while attaching a debugger manually. Click on Cancel to abort the JIT debug request.". If I hit retry here nothing happens.

Still no error.txt generated in the folder where the app resides.

@Ernegien: Looking forward to use some of that Forza4 tracks soon 
I was wondering if u ready with tracks and their textures, could u upload the whole program of Forza.. Cause i never can use it, eventhough i have installed Microsoft softwares for it like u suggest   only Forza tool works for me that was uploaded by someone who fixed it while ago. I'm using Win 7 x64 sp1  

Btw, does anyone know what to use to extract Forza4 dvd's .iso  

Edit: Nevermind i figured it out with Xiso > [http://www.eurasia.nu/modules.php?name= ... _(windows)](http://www.eurasia.nu/modules.php?name=Downloads&d_op=viewdownloaddetails&lid=8519&ttitle=extract-xiso_v2.6.3_%28windows%29)
Just need to drag and drop .iso into this dos program and it starts to unpack it into the same dir as ur .iso

Since it appears that the mods would rather delete entire posts rather than prune stale links to "illegal" content, any further discussion/updates will be posted on my blog at [http://codeescape.com/](http://codeescape.com/).

Thanks Ernegien for all your great work, lately couldnt write due problems with internet. All the models I opened untill now works great, beside BMW 850CSi which has weird mapping of "black" material, maybe t10 screw it hmm.

Huh. Using that kapatan file, ForzaStudio works for the first time for me (for FM3 stuff). Weird. Imports into ZM2 perfectly. So quick and easy. Geez.

Now if I could just get into the FM4 stuff...

Ran into a little problem with the Hummer H1 SLOD
Here is the complete lights mapping:
[](http://www.imagebam.com/image/f612d9186148008) 
Notice how crowded that area on the left is, and also that some parts of the texture are not used at all. I triple checked and everything is there. I know there are some interior lights, but those are mapped separately on another texture.

Zooming in on some of the objects in the circled area clearly shows they match the unused parts of the texture:
[](http://www.imagebam.com/image/aada29186148023) [](http://www.imagebam.com/image/82e372186148028)

Can you please check this Ernegien? I'm curious if it's a FS bug or a FM4 bug

For me it looks like place for chrome effect, or sometimes when there are some unused things of model, which they doesn't matter of the final look, they are placed on one place.

Don't you find it strange that all objects crowded in that gray area are shaped exactly like the unused parts of the texture?

And it's not supposed to be a chrome effect, those are all glass parts.

Well You got the answer... Tell me, glass is transparent right? so why it will need correct mapping? Also Forza doesn't use something like windshields so that's the reason why glass is mapped like that. Lazy Turn's 10 ass.

Transparency is one thing, clear glass is another! Transparent glass/plastic can have any color. Mkey?!

Windshields are a different story in Forza, don't mix them up. Anything with "glass" material usually doesn't use a diffuse texture, but objects like detail_glass_clear or detail_glass_amber do have it.

I think it's just something connected with game coding or game bug...   I don't know. Simply, ask Turn 10 . I looked into game text files with textures but nothing, which is connected with such strange glass mapping.

Their line was busy ) I'm gonna wait for Ernegien instead. I just wanna know if it's Turn10 laziness or not before I start manual mapping.

Hello:)

Got a question:

Has anybody of you textured a whole  S-Lod Car ( Autovista Model ) ?

If yes:

What are the textures , that you can texture complete interior? 

There are Interior1.xds and Interior2.xds but  what else?


Would be great if some one can explain that.

Yes.

For most interior and boot objects you have the interior2 texture. interior(1) is usually applied to gauges and badges (button markings).
Some interior parts use stitching, cloth, mottled or headliner textures. You'll easily identify these by their material name. If your model uses the former 3, you'll have to tile or resize the mapping.

Hi
thank you for your answer:)

I tried to texture the 599 GTO interior but i got problems with the inner door. I can't find the right texture... it's always very bright .. or it's very dark. It doesnt fit with the stitching texture.

I'll post a screen soon.

Here is now the little Screen of the interior.
[](http://www.abload.de/image.php?img=534534534copy5ozzg.png)
#1  What texture is the right texture for this? i mean this part where the air is coming out from the air condition.
#2 Is this the right texture?
#3 Where do i find the Manettino Texture?

Would be nice if someone responds on that:)




Edit: Other question.


Is it possible to get the model and textures from the showrooms of Forza like the Top Gear Studio or the other ones?

Most FM textures are dark, but they look better in-game thanks to normal maps and shader settings. You will have to tweak materials yourself to get the desired look in renders.

1. That looks right, considering the above
2. Check youtube for Autovista clips, it's the only way to be sure
3. The  Manettino has a digital_gauge material, which as far as I can tell doesn't use conventional mapping; you will have to create a (black) texture) yourself.

Regarding the stitching, you must enable transparency to get the right look.

Hi there

Sorry to bother people here again but I have a quick question.

I'm trying to find the sounds for a specific car but I cannot immediately spot them among the .fsb files as the file names don't appear to apply to the particular car I'm extracting, so how do I find out exactly what sound files it uses if I cannot tell by the .fsb file names - is there a file somewhere, like game.db, which tells the game what .fsb file to use for a particular car and if so can we look in that file (and obviously what is that file called)?

I've looked in game.db but can't find any references to the audio files used by any of the cars.

Many thanks.

Hi, Ernegien. Been awhile.. Any news about the tracks and their textures?
To bad they empty'ed the first page, but i've been checking your page and still hoping for something new!
Some coders should help you to make this tool all-in-one Forza thing..

PS: Soon there is also new game of Forza Horizon coming, i hope this one is going to be also useable!

Hi everyone

I have a question. I'm trying to open the content of a DLC, there is a big file with no extension, how can I see the content?  The same happened with the 2nd DVD of Forza 4, I extracted the content with "exiso" but after that I have few files of 800MB each that they have no extension. Any ideas how to open them?

Thanks in advance.

Hey all:)

Is it possible to import the "Render Scenes or Photo Scenes" of Forza 4 into 3dsmax and texture them completely?

I am talking about the scenes like the country road where you can take a picture of your car or the Top Gear Studio.

Do you have the ability to convert a car ?

Yes, I try with Maple Valley (Forza3 & last Forza Studio) and... and the mapping is 

I try also with PGR4, 

1) Las_Vegas_night.pak (21.9Mo) & Las_Vegas_game.pak (12.3Mo)
2) Extraction of Las_Vegas_game.pak with Game_Extractor  =  2 files : FILE0.jc (0Mo) & FILE1.jc (771Mo)

and now I'm stuck with the FILE1.jc file (771 Mo) ! I don't know this extension...  

Any idea ?

* sorry for my translation.

Best regards.

Awesome work! Thanks Ernegien! Here is a picture of fujimi kaido track that I am currently working on, going to add trees in later.   

[](http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/193/fujimount2.jpg/)


I have one question here that someone might be able to help me, something probably simple and I am not researching properly  How do I copy DLC from my xbox360 to my PC? I remember there was a program that can browse files on the xbox but I cannot remember the name. If someone can point in the right direction I can further research it myself.   

Thank you again Emegien!

I *think* you're talking about WX360. I can't remember if that's the right program or not, but you should be able to find what you need at [www.xbox-scene.com](http://www.xbox-scene.com)

Yes those programs will work, but unfortunately my xbox HDD cannot connect with my SATA HDD bays on my PC.    But I did manage to find the DLC I wanted to copy, the Top gear May Car Pack.

I am pretty new here and to this thread. I have started to read most of the thread lots of pages. I can get the cars extracted and textures. I am trying for the tracks. I can get objects and textures but the textures are not lining up. Just wondering if there is a fix for that yet? I am not using the models for any kind of modding just doing some renders and making some scenes.

I think it's a bonus functionality in addition to primary goal - convert car models, so it's feature has very limited support by author...

You can use [this tool](http://www.ctpax-x.org/?goto=files&show=24) for conversion to wav. Put towav.exe and ConvAll.bat from archive into one folder with forza sound banks .fsb(s) and run ConvAll.bat.
One .fsb contains multiple (10-15) sound samples, so put one in empty folder before running .bat, or you'll be overwhelmed by tons of .wav-s =)

A couple of samples were sent to me yesterday, but I could still use some SLOD ones if available.  I've spent a couple of hours on this already and should hopefully have something to show in the next day or two

I see. Very nice to hear! 
Does Forza Horizon even has SLOD models? I thought Turn10 has stopped the SLOD files since Dodge Viper 2013.

They might not have SLODs anymore, I was just acknowledging the possibility.  Progress is good so far however, and I've got my application parsing through all of the major LOD0 and cockpit model file structures.  Unfortunately, the vertex format appears to have changed yet again, so I'll likely be wrestling with that for a while.  Hopefully it won't come down to disassembling the game's executable to figure out exactly what's going on, as I have no interest in learning PPC anytime soon

Vertex format ended up being similar to Forza 4 and just a simple off-by-4-bytes error on my end

Things are coming along quite nicely  Asset quality is pretty amazing from what I've seen so far, and I'm really looking forward to the release of this game.  Once it's out, I'll probably release an updated version of Forza Studio a few days after, when I'm confident in its ability to process the majority of the targeted resources.  Track objects now have different LODs so I'll need to switch things around a bit.  Colorado has 14+ million polys (lod0-whatever) with all objects being parsed right now

WOW 14 million polygones, wondering how that could run smoothly in the console.  
Interesting information

great work Ernegien, tks for all that Time and work u spend in Forza Studio  

one question about that bin.zip file in Track folder, seems u can extract they, but when i try to use Quickbms with Script that until now work with cars and Tracks, it won´t work with these new Forza Horizon Track Bin.zip Files, may u have a hint for me ?

i get the that error message
------------------------------
- SCRIPT's MESSAGE:
  the file is encrypted, you must set ZIP_PASSWORD in the script

- SCRIPT's MESSAGE:

The basic structure of the zip files is outlined very nicely in the link below.  For some reason, the Horizon track bin.zip files do not contain local file headers before each chunk of compressed data.  The good news, however, is that all of the information needed to extract the files is also located at the end of the file in a similar list of entries called the central directory.

The main difference here is that the local header offset in each central directory entry now points directly to each file's compressed data.  For compatibility purposes, my application first checks the data at this offset for the expected local header signature (0x504B0304), and if found, processes things normally.  Otherwise, it just jumps right into the data and begins decompression.

I would imagine it be just an extra few lines of code to patch the quickbms zip script to account for these missing local file headers.  It's something I have no interest in doing, but if anyone needs any help, I'll be around...

Consoles can run these amount of polies without problems by great levels of programming, great levels of optimizations
and special created textures.
Developers are way too lazy when it comes to the PC platform and that is a very very big ashame.

but the other reason why consoles can handle 14 million polies is because of exclusive.
Look at Uncharted: Last of Us an Gran Turismo 5 and now look at Forza4.
Developers who develope games for ONE platform will make them easy to get the maximum out of that platform.
They even can get beyond the limitations of the hardware. Fr an example, look at GTA V.

Ontopic.
Energien, may I ask why there is a support for the maps?
Do you think these big ass maps can be converted to games? lol
But damn, very good job!!! :O

I wonder if you can investigate the files when a Forza game is made for next gen: Xbox720 or some other fancy name lol

I can indeed confirm that's the script you'd need to modify   However, after taking a look at the code, the changes required would be more than a few lines and I'd rather not waste my time with a scripting language relatively foreign to me when I've already developed my own solution.  Forza Studio will support extraction of these zips once released in a week or so...

Awesome work Ernegien looking forward to the new Forza Studio!   
I don't know why, but Forza Studio 4.0 stopped working for me  . It was working fine this morning, but when I came home from work and booted up my PC, went to load Forza Studio and it says "Has stopped working" and does not give me an error report  . I did not install anything new or change any files, not sure what happened, maybe a windows update? I don't know.   But looking forward to your new release!!  

PS: I have another computer that it still works on, just got to get up and sit in other chair.

Oh my PC specs. (The one that Forza Studio stopped working on)

Windows 7 64bit
16 gig of ram
Nvidia geforce 560Ti
Intel Core I7-2600k Processor

EDIT: I found out the problem, I need new glasses   . Do not switch your Icons/text size to 125 DPI or above, because that cause forza studio to not work!

I finally got around to merging my Horizon stuff into the main project and everything appears to be functioning as it should.  I haven't done any real regression testing yet so backwards compatibility might suffer in some instances, but it should be good enough for now.  Please let me know if you experience any problems...

Hi guys,
When I go in the Hard Disk for extract the files from Forza Horizon I can found only the cars of the DLC like Aventador J etc....
Where can I found all cars of the game?

so here is a question that I have been wondering about, when they were hyping this and before it GTV they said that it had over a million triangles for the highest detail car models, and before that for GTV they said it had 500000 for the photo mode models, does anyone know the real numbers? are these accurate?

By GTV you mean Gran Turismo 5? If yes, then no, it's not true.
A standard polycount in Forza 3-4 is around 130k triangles. Some more but not over 200k.
Autovista models in Forza4 are 500k-700k triangles, only the Autovista models have these details.
GT5 nowhere has these huge amount of triangles count.

Here are some GT5 pictures and if you have trained eyes and look closer, you can see the edges of the triangles:

(look at the places of the taillights)

And most of the cars are way too smooth than supposed in real life.

But don't get your hopes up if you want it so bad. GT5 cannot be hacked.

No problem, man!
GT5 is not that really worthy because only 200 cars are premium cars and the rest of 800-900 are mediumpoly and they have no interior.

Hi everyone,

 i´m new here and i will use this Thread to explain what i´m looking for.I´ve got some extra packs from FM4 in a ZIP file.Once it´s unzipped on my desk .how should i do, to be abble to open it to get some .carbin etc to open it with FORZA STUDIO ?

This is the file i ve got once unzipped:



The point of this is to have the possibility to have some .OBJ to work on it with 3DS MAX , to make nice renders.

In advance thanks

I use wxPirs tool.

Thanks for the tips,but now what is the next step , once the pack is unzipped .I have some FSB file .What should i use, FORZA STUDIO?

Ok , i think FSB files are sound files:
Answer: A file with the FSB file extension is a FMOD Sample Bank Format file.
FSB files are usually used to store sound information, like music and speech, for video games designed for popular console systems like the Xbox, PlayStation, and more.

I´m a bit lost now ;(

Next step is unpacking .zip files with QuickBMS and zip.bms script, then you have folders with .carbin files for Forza Studio and .xds files with textures (XTX tool can convert them to .TGA).

But if you need only renders, i have easy solution for you )
Check your PM.

Oh my PC specs. (The one that Forza Studio stopped working on)

Windows 7 64bit
16 gig of ram
Nvidia geforce 560Ti
Intel Core I7-2600k Processor

EDIT: I found out the problem, I need new glasses   . Do not switch your Icons/text size to 125 DPI or above, because that cause forza studio to not work!

YOU SIR DESERVE A SIX PACK OF BEER!!! I've been fighting this for the last year. WHY COULD I NOT GET FORZA STUDIO TO RUN? My DPI was set @ 120. After setting it back to the defualt of 96 the program instantly works perfectly. Insane! But I'll take it. Thanks for sharing the information. And of course thanks to the author of the program...maybe a case of beer?

Hello

I'm trying to find the Sedona and Nordschleife track files on the discs but I am unable to locate them, I have looked on disc 2 but all I can see in the disc 2 files is the cars and their wheels.

Please could someone advise me as to where the files for these tracks is on the FM3 (or FM4) discs.  If it's on disc 2 how do I extract it? - all the tools I've got, wxPirs, Forza Studio etc. only extract the cars and wheels.

Many thanks.

Anybody still messing with the carbin format? 

I've contacted Ernegien about the possibility of importing a obj file back into the carbin which he said quite possible just no time for it.

Anyone else have the ability to do so? I'd gladly throw a couple hundred bucks your way.

Sorry for the shameless pump but I do need some help...

My pc couldn't start Forza Studio, whenever I double clicked on the exe, it prompted "Forza Studio has stopped working"

I have tried everything I googled but still no luck:

1. Icon sized was already at default 100% 
2. .NET and XNA Framework already installed

what's making it weirder was that it worked only for the very old version of Forza Studio, but still the same error for whatever versions (4.0/4.1) 

I have always wanted to try on putting mods myself but that's just so frustrating to have the issue. thus I am seeking advice here to see if it'd get any better.

Thanks in advance for the help!

Not yet, Xbox One reverse engineering is still in its infancy and I don't believe anyone has figured out how to extract the file contents from the game archives yet.

As for your problems lkof, can you paste me the stack information from the application errors you should be seeing in your event logs?

Hi!

I'm a new user.

Is possible reimport a new livery ingame, but without use the internal graphic editor.

My dream is use photoshop, then convert the file in the correct format and put it ingame.

I've try to search about in forum but nothing.

Thanks in advance.

Before there is any kind of FM5 model extraction/import, we need general tools to unpack XBONE discs.

Not possible. You can't even mod save games yet on the Xbox One, so it'll be quite a while.

FH2 has been released for both Xbox 360 and Xbox One, that LaFerrari is ripped from the Xbox 360 version. The Xbox 360 versions lacks of some new cars which are Xbox One exclusives, like the Ariel Atom 500 V8 for example, and of course DLC cars. Google is your friend guys.

Next step is unpacking .zip files with QuickBMS and zip.bms script, then you have folders with .carbin files for Forza Studio and .xds files with textures (XTX tool can convert them to .TGA).

But if you need only renders, i have easy solution for you )
Check your PM.

Sorry to necropost, but what's this XTX tool? I tried searching but didn't have any luck. I wanted to see if it allowed textures to be injected back in.

Not sure about injecting back, this tool works with simple drag'n'drop to exe (i make it default for "Open with..." command for .xds), but sometimes conversion ends with error, and leave unbundle.exe (if i remember correctly) and another .exe in convertion folder (they autodeletes quickly if convertion success) - i never tested that exes for command line responses (like -h, /? or without arguments).

Hi everyone.

I want to extract the DeLorean DMC 12 from Forza 4 but I don't know how to do that. I got the original game discs for my XBox 360 but I have no idea how to open the files with Forza Studio.
I only want to export the DMC 12 and import it into 3D Studio Max.

Thanks!

First of all, sorry for bumping this thread.

I have issue with Chipi's unofficial build.
Image is better than 100 words so:
When I attempt to import aftermarket wheels in 4.4 t2 i get error on the image - on the right and only texures are imported to the program. (I also tried lower chipi's builds with same results).
But when I do exactly the same thing on 'official' 4.1, the mesh is imported.


Thanks.

Forza 6 apex uses new format, modelbin. Quick look through and it's a lot different than the previous carbin format. The carbin file itself is still there though appears to just be used as the file that connects all models together.

It's coming along, slowly but surely.
I have most of the file format mapped out for some time now, I just need to put it all together.
Unfortunately time is not on my side, but I hope to do some work this weekend.

@gpfan I have most of my C# converters published here: [https://github.com/RaduMC?tab=repositories](https://github.com/RaduMC?tab=repositories)
If all goes well I hope to update the Apex project tomorrow.

...just a question, does anyone know how to get to the 3d models of the tracks? I am interested in TopGear and Sebring...

Also is there any progress on Forza 6 from xBOne?

Thanks and cheers...

Still with Forza Studio, same as with the cars.
The process just needs more time because of the many textures.

...I have problems starting it, btw Win10 64bit. I don't know is it because of Windows version, or is it the old version of FS.

Just in case someone is wondering if it's actually really possible to convert Forza tracks, yes it is.

The model in the video it's in Autovista quality, the one you have extracted probably not.

How did you uncompress the zip's? It's a new compression method and the file names all should be mumbled jumbled :S

EDIT: Same format as Apex. Each part has it's own folder and model file (.modelbin) now, whereas previous forza's were packed into one file. It still has a .carbin, but it doesn't contain any 3d meshes, although I think it stores the xyz position and scale for the models. Here is the vulcan front bumper. Has no correct position or scaling on its own.

yeah I finally able to update my os version to one that would allow me to move my install of forza horizon 3 but what I have on my external HDD is gibberish files and folders

the main folder with all the data is called "gq6$l" and when you click to open it it opens alright but all I have is rows of simular gibberish ie: "^$8qgl1$^yl~~q1~.,$u" 

 now I can download and transfer forza 6 apex just fine and be able to access all the files but this is just useless.   I get the feeling that that renamer might decypt it but I have to admit after an hour of playing with the renamer I am not getting anywhere. any help from those who've decrypted this all would be greatly appreciated.

The model and texture files have been ripped. Models in 'modelbin' format and textures in 'swatchbin' format. But there is no way to open these files

I still don't even know how you got the zip's all in "store" method. My horizon 3 zip's are all in method 22 compression which is a new one. Mind giving links (in pm if must) to where you got that?

My bad the link i got the FH3 file from is now dead. I wouldn't mind uploading them should there be updated tools.
But it seems a waste of time at the moment seeing as you can't use them yet. That's why i only posted a few.

I have most of the file format mapped out for some time now, I just need to put it all together.
Unfortunately time is not on my side, but I hope to do some work this weekend.

@gpfan I have most of my C# converters published here: https://github.com/RaduMC?tab=repositories
If all goes well I hope to update the Apex project tomorrow.

Hi mate, suposed to update the Apex studio but til now you didn´t, everything ok with this project?

Hi, please do not double post if you are not adding substantial/critical information. Bumping the topic every few days will not get you 3D models any quicker. To my knowledge the game files are supposedly encrypted (FH3).

==

I'm being told a "debug" version of FH3 PC was accidentally pushed in a patch a few days ago. This has all files decrypted, if anyone has it you might want to post it or file samples. I'm interested in taking a look at the 3D models.

Oh, and if there are more violations of forum rules, this thread might be temporarily locked.

Cheers.

Here's the 2016 Cadillac ATS-V model from the dumped debug version. I thought I'd send one that's unreleased just in case they're different to the retail version cars. I don't think there's any difference but I'd love if someone could get into them.

Eventually something will happen with it.

I have the full build backed up so don't worry about *me* losing it either.

Not sure if this helps at all but it seems that the texture format, .swatchbin, is frequently (but not always) referred to as a .png in the .exe's strings.



This string refers to media\UI\textures\data_bound\anthem(which is a .zip)\bucketlist_tiles\Challenge_Placeholder_1.png, but if I navigate there:



It's just a .swatchbin file. Simply renaming the extension to .png doesn't work as you'd probably expect, but it might be helpful to know it seems to act like they're PNGs.

.modelbin meshes appear to be simple but some uvs, like for the hood_a are a lttle bit tricky.

The fact that you have anything so far is pretty amazing. I have no idea about any of this stuff but keep it up!

EDIT: I have no idea if this might help - every car has a much smaller (around 1KB) .carbin_debug. I know it's probably too small to contain actual model data, but it must have something. Have you checked that for the CAD_ATSV_16?

From what small research i did into the file format. apex and horizon 3 are the same. Carbin contains the material data, modelbin of course contains the model and uv's. I dont know much about reversing 3d but from the looks of it, it may also have a few different lod's in it. It also doesn't have sizing and positioning by itself and is located elsewhere just like previous forza games with the carbin. Just look back a few pages and can see the sizing issues when i imported into 3ds max.

Tried the swatchbin texture file also and used the samples minime891 posted back in october, this is what texturefinder shows.


I don't have any knowledge of programing so never attempted to even make a tool or import script, leave that to the pro's.

Is it not possible that modelbins contain other modelbins? I believe that in the debug game trunkBadge_a is treated as a child of the trunk itself (whatever that's named) as it's attached to the trunk object.

guess it's the CAD_ATSV_16.carbin where I have to look at for hierarchy, if any

But I'll leave this problem for now (same with the positioning) since uvs is the thing to deal with where I got a little bit stuck atm.

wingMirrorL_a is a real little beasty, it has 6 materials and the original uv map of wingMirrorL_a_3 (uv's  count=1741) really looks horrible (you'll see that if you comment out all start_x groups from the obj file in the following post).

The picture shows how I tried to circumvent this by introducing some more (start_x) groups (where only the two biggest seem to make sense, but how to find them programmatically?):

Since I don't find the texture for wingMirrorL_a I'll make a break so that you guys might fiddle arround with the obj file in the next post and maybe share your thoughts.

Maybe I'm seeing problems where aren't any (as always  ) and we've just to put the tex on that damned thing and done? (Is it sufficient to apply one texture to the highest lod mirror?)

and here's the wavefront obj file of that mirror. Remember to comment out the g gstart_x lines  by putting a # in front of them.
Then try to put a texture onto wingMirrorL_a_3 - good luck.

Ah, well, see, scrolling thru this thread I realized that D3FEKT seems to have a maxscript already since 3 months.
(Maybe he's stuck at uvs, too.)

(Well, I care for my own projects now, since it doesn't make sense to me to work on things that are already being processed.  )

Stop it.

I don't want this thread locked again now that we're making actual progress just because you can't be patient enough to stop asking for updates.

Hi All!

Some posts have been removed from this topic. I recommend taking the time to read this post as I will not be repeating this again. Please refrain from constantly bumping a topic on a daily basis. If you have substantially useful information to provide that is fine. Persistently bumping will not get things solved any quicker and may be interpreted as spam.

Permanent and/or temporary bans may be handed out if this nonsense continues despite me kindly requesting on multiple occasions to cease such behavior.

Cheers.

Bear in mind that D3FEKT also said "I don't have any knowledge of programing so never attempted to even make a tool or import script, leave that to the pro's." D3FEKT might be able to make more progress if/when he gets a look at the debug build, but due to his own admissions I think in this situation you're our closest thing to a pro  

And, regardless, people collaborating on something can always help. Two pairs of eyes on the same thing and all that.

Bumping, but it's for potentially useful stuff if not already known.

There's a guide on Se7ensins discussing the formats of Forza 4 models here: [https://www.se7ensins.com/forums/thread ... g.1384518/](https://www.se7ensins.com/forums/threads/big-tu-3d-forza-4-editing.1384518/)

It explains the structures and positionings of items on the car, which materials they can be set to use, size scaling, etc. I know it's for Forza 4 and that things will have changed with their model format since 2011 but the core concepts are likely similar/the same, so it might be worth reading.

Also, @shakotay2 or anyone else, is there any other ways I can help? Any files from the debug game that might help your research?

> It explains the structures and positionings of items on the car,thanks; on a quick glance I couldn't derive any senseful information from it, though. (It's more a tutorial about modding Forza 4, not about the 3D format.)

Here's how the CAD_ATSV looks so far:



CAD_ATSV_1.JPG (231.13 KiB) Viewed 251 times


I've added increasing offsets to the parts to break up the clump a little bit.

Here's the wavefront obj file.  Didn't care for the scaling so far. Some (or many) uvs aren't correct. Without textures it doesn't make too much sense to waste more time with them, imho.

After blender import you should press 's', then 0.02 [ENTER]
Then 'N' and set view/clip END from 1000.0 to 100000.0 (that's the best tip I ever found for big objects in blender)
[CAD_ATSV_x_y.zip](http://www.uploadmb.com/dw.php?id=1484204013)

(There's some minor LODs which should be "filtered out" somehow. Maybe just sorting the parts by their vertex counts?)

I've tried some manual positioning but it's all crap, a waste of life and time.  

There's some kind of skeleton in body_a.modelbin for example with hierarchy and matrices
but guess it won't help since most names don't fit to the names of the parts to be found in blender's outliner window.

(Even worse this "skeleton" seems to be identical to the one in hood_a.modelbin - simply a copy from CAD_ATSV_16_skeleton.modelbin.)

I believe the avpins files are simply the animations/position translations of the car parts in Autovista mode, hence "HoodClosed" and stuff like that, as well as avpins = AutoVistapins

Regarding the UV problem shakotay2 mention some posts behind i remember Ernegien who made forza studio had some issues aswell to find the cure for it back then fot Forza 4,  i´m positive his the guy who can help figure it out some of this puzzles! I suspect that everything must be very similar to Ernegien Forza studio code afterwards.....

> I suspect that everything must be very similar to Ernegien Forza studio code afterwards.....If you think so that would be very easy, since the code is public.

So compile it, put your breakpoints at the suiting places, load a  (simple) Forza4 car model, then log, how the materials are assigned.
For example in ForzaStudioForm.cs

```
                            for (int j = 0; j < mesh.Indices.Length; j += 3)
                            {
                                int i1 = mesh.Indices[j + 0] + 1;
                                int i2 = mesh.Indices[j + 1] + 1;
                                int i3 = mesh.Indices[j + 2] + 1;
```

But you'll need an XBox360 SDK or something like that, or at least these include files:
#include "d3d9.h"      // Note: make sure this is the Xbox 360 flavor of D3D9.h!
#include "xgraphics.h"

(I don't have the time for such, prefer the quick 'n dirty way.  )

Anyways, you may have missed the wheels in the previous uploaded CAD_ATSV_16 obj file:

The current version of Forza Studio don't support Japanese because of a fatal error. Forza Studio will support Japanese anyway?

I've applied translation offsets to a subset of parts (scaling/rotations still wrong) but it remains a little mess:

well, I was searching for quaternions to get some rotation but seems the scaling was the problem:

That's a little bit strange, after all.  

The exhaust is burried in some kind of "case" which I don't understand.
But maybe it's the same as with the wheels which seem to require a special treatment like some other parts, too.

So there's still some position offset issues to solve. But I don't have any idea about that, to be honest.

edit: forzaHorizon mesh extractor is in my sig now - read the readme.txt BEFORE using the exe file.
ATTENTION: the exe may freeze and produce large files (about 260  for the DB11 for example.)
So if you don't know how to kill a task on your system then PLEASE don't use Make_H2O-ForzaHor.exe!
You have been warned.

(Some issues remain, mainly multi-textured? uvs, doors, hoods, steeringWheels without correct scale/position offset.)
btw: I've shown the low-LOD door's uvmap since the one from the high_LOD is ugly 

yeah, these are the disadvantages of stupid pattern searches: patterns may vary.  
(Now the hood is scaled correctly but the position offset is still wrong...)

If you need it perfect you'll have to wait for the ForzaStudio update, if any.

Also, @shakotay2, I understand that it's a huge undertaking so the answer is likely no, but would there ever be plans to somehow repackage edited models back as a modelbin that the game can support?

shakotay2@ First of all many thanks to take your time to figure this out and let us manipulate this beauty´s (3d models) as they are the best around! 

The only issue i see right now to have usable 3D models is the fact that some mesh names have more then 1 lod, in fact they have all lods together and it´s impossible to work and separate them in a good and fashion way.... You need to do the work manually and that will take big amount of your time doing it! 

On the AST_DB11 for instance body_a_4 has all body lods packed together on same name, if it was a way to make the extraction with separate lods it would make more sense.....
To use blender or 3ds max is the same thing, some names have the lods all packed together on same name item.

An example of what i´m talking about, made some tests on FORZA 6 APEX model and what is happening:

File comes with 5 LOD´S packed all together



After some work detaching parts and reassemble them in order to fit properly i found those 5 lods



Same happens on bumpers front and rear, bodys, wheels, calipers, rotors, doors, fenders etc, all the big ones with more then 3000/4000 faces are meshes with several lod meshes all together.

Hope you or someone find the solution for this.

Well apart LODs that are merged all together also models dont have materials yet and incorrect UV. I think they are in very huge scale too.
Hope this problems can be solved, it's amazing that you already got until this point of progress.
Good luck


BTW. any idea how to open textures?

Speaking of textures, I'll repeat this in case it helps:

The game seems to read or treat the .swatchbin files like .png files. For example a fake filepath like "UI\textures\thumbnail.swatchbin" is referred to as "UI\textures\thumbnail.png". Simply renaming swatchbins to PNGs of course doesn't work.

The UV map is not like before, in F4 they used one texture for body...... now they have separate maps as you see in scene folder .... So now the UV map is divided in 13 parts at least!!! You have on texture for each part alone!!!!

> shakotay2@ First of all many thanks to take your time to figure this out and let us manipulate this beauty´s (3d models) as they are the best around! 

The only issue i see right now to have usable 3D models is the fact that some mesh names have more then 1 lod, in fact they have all lods together and it´s impossible to work and separate them in a good and fashion way.... You need to do the work manually and that will take big amount of your time doing it! 

On the AST_DB11 for instance body_a_4 has all body lods packed together on same name, if it was a way to make the extraction with separate lods it would make more sense.....
To use blender or 3ds max is the same thing, some names have the lods all packed together on same name item.

An example of what i´m talking about, made some tests on FORZA 6 APEX model and what is happening:

File comes with 5 LOD´S packed all together



After some work detaching parts and reassemble them in order to fit properly i found those 5 lods



Same happens on bumpers front and rear, bodys, wheels, calipers, rotors, doors, fenders etc, all the big ones with more then 3000/4000 faces are meshes with several lod meshes all together.

Hope you or someone find the solution for this.
So you mean they are grouped with same name inside each other?

oh that is not good i think. So should I import one part by one?

must be some way so fix that. you guys are brilliant here

I hope so...... hopefully someone will fix that, not me since i´m a noob on reversed engineering and need to relie on others....

So physically is only way to separate them? Or are they partly detached?

So far it can only be done manually -

you might have a look at this zipped obj file of AST_DB11-body_a to understand the problem better:
[AST_DB11-body_a.zip](http://www.uploadmb.com/dw.php?id=1484693327)

(Maybe there's some kind of magic table in the modelbin files where the "borders" of the lods are defined?)

so, finally I've come to a point where I'm a little bit stuck.
As you may know there's some submeshes (groups) which contain two or more submeshes.

There's up to 5 uv regions (blocksizes from 12 to 36 in modulo 4 steps) per object (*.modelbin) but that's not enough.
(I've detected an identical amout of uv regions with the same vt count (or about 100 vts less in some cases)
with a block size of 16 bytes but couldn't get them displayed properly, so it might be normals.)

Many autocreated groups are superfluous, means 4 to 6 of them should build ONE group only
but from the picture you can see that the triangles' FI NUMBERS are quite a mess partially
so it's hard to decide programmatically where the groups to start/end.

This list maybe contains the bounding boxes of the lods of AST_DB11, but didn't help either:

Great news 
Well now it's better. Just need fix materials thing and UV. 
Is there a way to get models and correct scale? they are very big.
And doors are in wrong position.

 Ok, wait, for the doors it's not possible so far since they need to be separated from each other before.)
edit: required offsets for hoods are different

Do you mean positions from each model's modelbin or the "main" modelbin? Just wondering because I experimented with a part swap: I put the Porsche 911's licence plate on the Audi R8, and the positioning of it was totally wrong. I don't precisely know which file could be controlling it, but the fact that it happened might possibly be helpful.

(But it's true, I've a deja vue of having skipped some promissing sections 'cause of lazyness.  
Still unsure whether it might be a matter of hierarchy.)

I think the position for doors might be saved in CARNAME_skeleton.modelbin or CARNAME_skeleton.gr2?

yep, makes sense that moveable parts like doors and hoods are being tied to the skeleton,
and when I use -0.884457 0.618187 0.656853 from boneDoorLF (in AST_DB11_17_skeleton.modelbin)
for re-positioning doorHandleLF_a it moves, but not enough.

Guess this position is relative to the root (bone)?

Maybe additional scaling is required, but to be honest, my motivation is low to spend more time for such details.
Would be more important to improve the uvs, imho.

Tried some more parts with varying success. Some polys still attached to different LODs.
I had problems with \lr_rangeroversvr_15\scene\interior\details\dashpad_a.modelbin the dash, steering wheel and steering column was one object and scaled wrong.
Also when trying to load the rear bumper i got the message "more than 15 submeshes in part - break".

I don't see a simple solutions there other than manually moving the group lines (such as g body_a_001) between the triangles (f 128/128 129/129 130/130).

Obviously there's the need of two different versions, one for the "straight" sections and one for the messed up sections.
("Straight" means that the face indices increase moderately, not such as f 15399 15401 15400, f 1023 15402 15403)
This would require a two pass scanning but it's more senseful to get the magic table that holds the grouping infos, if any.

edit: two pass scanning done and rewrite of grouping part
(You'll need the dlls from the zip in my sig for the exe to run.)

> I had problems with \lr_rangeroversvr_15\scene\interior\details\dashpad_a.modelbin the dash, steering wheel and steering column was one object and scaled wrong.All moveable parts are tied to a "skeleton" and need a special treatment. Their positions will always be wrong unless someone creates  the skeleton hierarchy including "root". (Should be solvable but my "time stock for this project" runs out of contence atm.  )

I didn't pay attention to the steering wheels so far, will try to fix the scaling. The "one object problem" is a matter of missing group lines. (I'll try to improve the autocreation algo but there's sections in the triangles list that tend to confuse it massively.)

> Also when trying to load the rear bumper i got the message "more than 15 submeshes in part - break".That's easy to fix, though I'm wondering why it needs more than 15 submeshes per object (=part). Guess the autocreation algo creates groups where they aren't needed.

Thanks for your feedback!

Do you think it´s possible to create a tool to extract the texture from the swatchbin to understand how they done the job and to do some tests on the models to see what parts are good and what need to be improve eventually?? 

I confirm that some meshes still come with all lods together and other comes partially separated, usually the ones that are together are the last 2-3 lower lod´s, higher lods are separated.
- Some parts from the interior with lod´s are also being imported as one piece.
- Steering wheel is scale with wrong dimensions.

So no go for positioned doors and hoods/trunks/windows?  
That´s not big deal since it´s easy to place them on the right place manually, that´s all one question of some love and talent...    

Maybe you could further improve the  Make_H2O-ForzaHor-gc.exe for better import of separate objects?  
i uploaded the sample rollCage_a.modelbin i´m not able to import with separate parts, maybe it helps you to improve the exe....

Done some research of modelbin structure.
Header, 20 bytes:

hprM (Mrph) entry - I think it's morphing data for characters models, looks empty:

(it's last index entry and no next entry header start offset is present, so global "data start" from main Grub header must be used)

So, we have 100 entries in sum: 1 Skel entry, 1 Mrph entry, 10 MatI entries, 69 Mesh entries, 1 IndB entry, 5 VLay entries, 8 VerB entries mixed with 4 MBuf entries and 1 Modl entry.

Material data entries looks like file-inside-file, they have personal Grub header with local adressing, I cut out one for closer look:
[](http://fastpic.ru/view/90/2017/0122/2e8462ba539544f6447e76893662a22c.png.html)
As you can see, two entries is present "MATI" and "MTPR" and those entries is also using local adressing.

Another strange thing is Name entry - this entry must have name lenght in symbols for correct reading, and it have it, but in strange format, like mirrored byte:
[](http://fastpic.ru/view/91/2017/0122/214310416f7f1885beedba7c18108914.png.html)
...or in some hex format I'm not familiar with:
[](http://fastpic.ru/view/90/2017/0122/66e9c3a93ad74131550899dfa755ef47.png.html)
18 is 12h and 31 is 1Fh - I can see some logic here, but it's strange.

ive did some  research also du the meshes i dont know if you allready figured out  but in blender  when you go in edit mode and  first  delete all the double edges/vertics/faces then you able to  select only the SLOD shape  and then by press ctrl + i so only the non SLOD is selected and easy to remove 


and by accedent i converted a fm5 model to obj ... but  dont remember how i did that >_<

can maybe send me the  Make_H2O-ForzaHor-gc.exe version?  i do have the  Make_H2O-ForzaHor-f.exe

which model did you try? (exe needs two dlls, see zip in my sig)

@nick22savino: the zip with the ...-gc.exe (grouping check) is in the post as of Sat Jan 21, 2017 2:32 pm

Dump your game and then use advanced file renamed to get proper names, and from there you get original.bin files

It works, but only for scratches texture: [https://yadi.sk/d/fAcK6hTE3AP3fc](https://yadi.sk/d/fAcK6hTE3AP3fc)
I also have no luck with interior textures, I think it's because they in X-Box DDS format, mentioned here: https://directxtk.codeplex.com/wikipage ... tureLoader

Upd: Got a result in some perverted way 
Added DX10 BC7 header to the interior texture and it looks non-working, loads fully transparent in most editors: [https://yadi.sk/d/eXfIt5LV3APFS5](https://yadi.sk/d/eXfIt5LV3APFS5)
But [this photoshop plugin](https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/intel-texture-works-plugin) gives me a options for loading, one of them is "Load Transparency as Alpha channel", I check it and got this:
[](http://fastpic.ru/view/91/2017/0123/96a90d6272940689b393216a45d258c1.png.html)

No transparency channel in exported image: [https://yadi.sk/i/umhi8jiW3APHBv](https://yadi.sk/i/umhi8jiW3APHBv)

BC3 and BC5 headers looks bad, so it's definitely BC7, but without alpha?..

Upd2: Ok, I do some tests, it's BC7 but alpha channel is black, so it's looks fully transparent.

Upd3: Good converter for those BC7 dds: [http://skyrim.pro/stati/instrumentarij/ ... -converter](http://skyrim.pro/stati/instrumentarij/100-dds-converter)

I applied the texture to the mesh and whilst the uv wasn't correct you only had to flip it and scale a little.
Just fyi the interior lod texture from previous forza models never had a alpha channel.

They have it for me 



Now I'm stuck with AO textures compression, nothing fits.
For compression type I suspect byte at pos. 74h in swatchbin header, for BC1 it's 00h, for BC7 it's 09h, but for AO textures it's 03h and none of standard compression types gives me adequate picture, BC1 gives rainbowed and messed up picture.
I suspect [A8-only format](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/bb173059%28v=vs.85%29.aspx), but 41h in compression type (byte at pos.80h in DX10 DDS header) is failed to load in viewer.

No any lod1 texture exists in Forza history, especially for interior...
Lods1-5 uses "nodamage" exterior texture with interior elements and with alpha of course.

Ok, I'm finished with all texture formats available in AST_DB11_17 archive 

My assumption about compression type byte in swatchbin header was right:
[](http://fastpic.ru/view/91/2017/0123/bc2baa627b77bef2ce3fe2a2b8083757.png.html)
Corresponding values are:
00h = BC1 (47h in DX10 DDS header)
03h = BC4 (50h in DX10 DDS header)
05h = BC5 (53h in DX10 DDS header)
07h = BC6H_UF16 (5Fh in DX10 DDS header)
09h = BC7 (62h in DX10 DDS header)
0Dh = R8G8B8A8 (1Ch in DX10 DDS header)
13h = A8 (41h in DX10 DDS header)

Converted all textures for AST_DB11_17, uploaded here: [https://yadi.sk/d/hn6DPnKq3AU8S9](https://yadi.sk/d/hn6DPnKq3AU8S9)
Format DX10 DDS, use Intel PS Plugin or DDS Converter from my previous [post](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?p=126590#p126590).

Note about conversion: most textures data is attached to headers with mipmaps, but textures in LiveryMasks and UI folders require headers without mipmaps, otherwise causes errors when opening.

Are you using pvrtextool wrap raw data option to extract the dds from swatchbins?

Those are just ripped from the game, they're not in any usable formats, so that doesn't help the efforts in this thread.

Awesome progress, not really understand how to convert these textures from swatchbin to dds.

Is disappointing that FH3 models doesn't have anymore nodamage and lights textures 

EDIT: how can I decrypt all that files with odd names that I have in my Forza folder?

No, it's doesn't reads correctly BC7 format.
I cut out swatchbin header, save chunk with compressed texture data, make new DX10 DDS texture from random picture with same dimensions and compress it to same format (using DDS Converter), cut out data part and save DDS header only, then attach swatchbin chunk to that header.
I'll make a step-by-step tuto, just wait a little.

If you want more information about unpacking Forza, you can start from here, then continue to "underground forum" (link in comments), then relax and start to search for already unpacked, decrypted and renamed game files

Ok, it's time for a little tuto: How to get Forza textures.
You'll need some tools:
[Hex Editor](https://sourceforge.net/projects/hexplorer/)
[DDS Converter](https://yadi.sk/d/43WKp-Sg3APMts) or [Noesis](http://richwhitehouse.com/index.php?content=inc_projects.php&showproject=91)
[Double Commander](http://doublecmd.sourceforge.net/site/eng/index.html) (free analog of Total Commander)

Step 1. Making of texture data chunk from swatchbin file:
Open swatchbin in hex editor and read important data in header before cutting it out:
[](http://fastpic.ru/view/91/2017/0123/bc2baa627b77bef2ce3fe2a2b8083757.png.html)
You'll need to know widht, height and compression type for making new DX10 DDS header, remember them, then select and delete header bytes up to "data start" position:
[](http://fastpic.ru/view/89/2017/0124/9a4816bb74ffc1937402de73adceb48a.png.html)
Table of compression types:
00h = BC1_UNORM (47h in DX10 DDS header)
03h = BC4_UNORM (50h in DX10 DDS header)
04h = BC4_SNORM (51h in DX10 DDS header)
05h = BC5_UNORM (53h in DX10 DDS header)
06h = BC5_SNORM (54h in DX10 DDS header)
07h = BC6H_UF16 (5Fh in DX10 DDS header)
09h = BC7_UNORM (62h in DX10 DDS header)
0Dh = R8G8B8A8_UNORM (1Ch in DX10 DDS header)
13h = A8_UNORM (41h in DX10 DDS header)

After you deleted header part, you need to "save as" edited file, I put memorized values as file extension for chunk, leaving name as is:
[](http://fastpic.ru/view/89/2017/0124/ee582a335cbbe1723a845deb979021bf.png.html)

Some tips for newbies:
You can see decimal numbers for widht/height right inside hex editor, just select two bytes and look in status bar:
[](http://fastpic.ru/view/89/2017/0124/c602bc40a9eb2d2e7a1f42b4ed498c2e.png.html)
"Data start" position reads backward, by bytes, so 04 01 00 00 reads as 00 00 01 04 - this is first byte position adress, displayed as Pos: 104h (260) in status bar if you put marker on them:
[](http://fastpic.ru/view/90/2017/0124/7927303d05ff3268012c8e88cc632a20.png.html)
Zeroes is skipped and (260) is decimal number of byte.

Step 2. Making of DX10 DDS texture with correct parameters:
So, we need a donor texture with 1024x512 dimensions and BC7 compression, let's make one 
Take any pic and resize it to 1024x512 in your favourite editor, save as 1024x512.png, then open in DDS Converter and set desired compression type:
[](http://fastpic.ru/view/89/2017/0124/d9916a229ad2e368ac2c77e51911a1b4.png.html)
Click "Convert" button, wait a little then click "Save as" button (it's becomes active after conversion is complete).
Name saving file as 1024x512xBC7.dds

Note: Some formats is missing in compression settings, BC4 for example, for this case I put those codes for DDS Headers in table of compression types above.
To make BC4 header out of BC7 one, you need to change one byte at Pos: 80h (128) from 62h to 50h and save result with new name:
[](http://fastpic.ru/view/91/2017/0124/bb6cc22164fbbb3ecf6107a3855becc4.png.html)

Step 3. Detaching header from generated DX10 DDS:
Open 1024x512xBC7.dds in hex editor, put marker in 94h position, press Ctrl+Shift+End to select all bytes to the end of file from selected position, delete:
[](http://fastpic.ru/view/89/2017/0124/41316738d2d6d2b50798d5f778f97c62.png.html)
Save result as 1024x512xBC7_header_only.dds:
[](http://fastpic.ru/view/91/2017/0124/fc3aa34be986f5852b5a29a389ceafd3.png.html)

Note: You can cut headers from already converted textures, or use the ones I have created so far (attached).

Step 4. Merging DX10 DDS header with swatchbin chunk:
Easiest way to do it is use of Total or Double Commander.
You need to copy header and chunk to same place and with same name, for example "1.dds", then select "Append" instead of default "Overwrite":
[](http://fastpic.ru/view/89/2017/0124/45f791a6b8e49214e4c0ea8c759d49b2.png.html)
Checking result:
[](http://fastpic.ru/view/91/2017/0124/efd16fdc35d14de20e5c44569967c69d.png.html)
Works 


Of course it's better to use original names instead of "1.dds" in example, also you can make copies of header for all swatchbins with same dimensions, easiest way to find them is sorting by size:
[](http://fastpic.ru/view/91/2017/0124/a34a6b09164a191f4e3c38787054c83c.png.html)
So, we have 27 files in sum with same size and, probably, same dimensions, time to make chunks (and check dimensions for sureness), this time saving with only "s" in extension for speed up process.
And our winner is!.. for_gauges_001_glos_7947570d-f283-4420-97b5-99398bf36ff4.swatchbin because it have a sligtly smaller size and it's a reason to tune file sizes appearance in Commander:
[](http://fastpic.ru/view/91/2017/0124/fc5a31c843c807f47f0168246c5d09ba.png.html)
Have skipped one file for now and the result is:
[](http://fastpic.ru/view/90/2017/0124/1aa37375e6c2caa9a39d9bd16a629223.png.html)
Lots of "s" chunk files 
Now we need a copies of DDS header, select one we have, press Ctrl+C, then Ctrl+V 25 times 
[](http://fastpic.ru/view/91/2017/0124/27e0ce9fb3a383b616126e82539f97b8.png.html)
Next step is renaming copies of DDS headers by copying swatchbin (or chunk) names and pasting to DDS header names:
[](http://fastpic.ru/view/90/2017/0124/133e772667d6932ee9a406a3112bd5d4.png.html)
(lots of moving selector to file, F2, Ctrl+Insert, move to another file, F2, Shift+Insert and repeat )
Now we append chunk files to dds files, we only need to delete file extension in copy dialogue window and .dds will pop up as suggested name:
[](http://fastpic.ru/view/89/2017/0124/b5ec10755604c690d127e9aecf44a4db.png.html)

I'll upload those gauges textures after conversion is finished, stay tuned

Dev version [here](http://www.mediafire.com/file/43zuz9qrvkcb5cw/ROL_Wraith_14.zip). Btw, no visible difference with dumped one from GM, according to filesizes. Maybe it's wrong reading of data for doors, not corrupted file.

Just a heads up, I've noticed, when using the tool the models get mirrored in the end, very noticeable with the engines

How is the quality/poly count of the FH3 models compared to the FM4 Autovista ones?
If the model exists in a previous chapter is it possible to recover the textures from that model instead of make all that process to get them?

Can you add a selector to "Make H2O" for UV channel source? So it rips not UV1 by default, but selected one (UV2 or 3, or 5)?
Btw, nice progress in version "i", all UV variants have standalone meshes 
But for UV scale testing we have only textures for UV2-5 (scratches, AO, radiosity, mud/snow), maybe cars with liveries have something for UV1...

When I spoke about "regions" I didn't mean channels; it's just like having an object with say 1000 verts where the "uv regions" have a count of 500, 300, 100, 50, 50 (=1000 in sum).
(I had used these counts to create groups (what I assumed to be LODs, so 5 lods in this example) in former versions but it wasn't the very best solution as you may know.)

> Btw, nice progress in version "i", all UV variants have standalone meshesok, so you say, one uv "variant"  per "lod"? "variant" means "channel", so it's no lods? 

With the autocreation of groups we get more of them (> 5 in most cases!) but it's just a "stupid" algo I use which doesn't care for uv channels (or let's say accidentally  ).

I found some other data with the same counts as above (500, 200, ... , 50) which I could think of to represent a second uv channel
(but might also be normals).

> But for UV scale testing we have only textures for UV2-5 (scratches, AO, radiosity, mud/snow), maybe cars with liveries have something for UV1...well, didn't apply textures so far, guess I'll know more after I've done that...

Hmm, let's clear this things 
I tested it only with one mesh so far - AST_DB11_17\scene\Exterior\SecondaryLights\taillightL_a.modelbin
Version "f" of Make_H2O gives me this result:
[](http://fastpic.ru/view/91/2017/0126/d7f3a18c694cc9b86c326a75e2c0d924.png.html)
No LODS and mess in UV.
Version "gc" gives this:
[](http://fastpic.ru/view/89/2017/0126/c00b313e3b41ef48d71e05dbcfd1f937.png.html)
Good LODS, but without submeshes and UVs is mixed.
And version "i" gives this:
[](http://fastpic.ru/view/89/2017/0126/1bb7ae966bdf3d49770c0ae251714f8d.png.html) [](http://fastpic.ru/view/89/2017/0126/a9e4bae416e1feaaa3a3923d656d5a35.png.html) [](http://fastpic.ru/view/89/2017/0126/d574d25afb3e6dbd2b963830900a1881.png.html)
LOD0 have 3 submeshes, UVs of first one looks messy, but it's a glass object, probably untextured, maybe it's normal.
Submeshes 2 and 3 have UVs for different textures (they crossed in bottom part), and they separated, it's good 
So, "variant" means "different texture layout".
And channel is wrong for AO textures:
[](http://fastpic.ru/view/90/2017/0126/6fc664fbd92ef179831844f3cbe4a0c9.png.html) [](http://fastpic.ru/view/90/2017/0126/c2bb11410b9dc6a3f594bd4d44e716d0.png.html)


Upd: This [Ford Ranger model](http://www.mediafire.com/file/9lsv19w7adpj8i7/FOR_RangerT6_14%28conv_tex%29.zip) (textures converted, also to PNG) is perfect for UV channels testing, because it have 3 different body textures, so we can test 3 UV channels:

Livery, damage, AO and badges - I have no idea how they applied.
How it looks: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iUmQl23j128](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iUmQl23j128)

But I have problems with conversion of body_a.modelbin, only 5 meshes with weird names appears:

(But there's a lot of vts missing in the body_a atm.)

well, applying the textures is even harder than expected (engineBay_a_AO for FOR_RangerT16-engine with forced grouping each 2500 face indices), Looks like it's the wrong uv map:

NVidia DDS plugin for Photoshop does not support DX10 dds ? It shows blank (black) image, while DDS converter shows it correctly.

Hi.
I use this version "Make_H2O-ForzaHor-i1.zip".
I have an error message - what does it mean? (Previous Versions worked fine).

I have an error message - what does it mean?It means that the large array for faces isn't large enough.  
In the MakeH2O_log.txt file search for # FIs, where the cnt is greater than 100000. Then send me the belonging modelbin(s), please:
# body_a.modelbin
# FIs' cnt: 125853

(The orange color is just the marker for selected uvs in blender.)

Make_H2O doesn't read mesh names, so it's only way to detect LODS is visually. But version "gc" separated lods correctly for that part. Personally, I don't care about lower lods, because I not convert cars to other games, just collect models.

It's about badges, they paste them over main livery, I have no idea how it's done 

> well, applying the textures is even harder than expected (engineBay_a_AO for FOR_RangerT16-engine with forced grouping each 2500 face indices), Looks like it's the wrong uv map:
I think it's better to start from simplier ones, like bumperF_a_AO or fenders_a_AO.

About splitting inside lods, i think it's done by materials, and previous Forza extractors also adds material names to the end of mesh names:
[](http://fastpic.ru/view/89/2017/0127/eb2c2302551980bb9d85ecea576edcb6.png.html)

So, lets continue [digging of modelbin format](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?p=126552#p126552):
Patient is taillightL_a from AST_DB11_17, 69 objects inside Grub container.
Skel data section is identical to one from body_a part, same for Mrph - both is useless at this stage.
Then we have 6 MatI entries, names are:

```
chrome
lights_smooth_CH1_custom_br
lights_smooth_CH1_custom_br_a
lights_smooth_CH1_custom_tailbr
lights_smooth_CH1_custom_tailbr_a
```

Materials looks pretty hard to convert, lots of small textures inside and links to shaders, which have additional textures, not so small, like mud and snow.

Not bad for just a light? 

Then we have Mesh entries, 30 of them have data lenght of 217 bytes and 16 have 201 bytes in lenght.
Header data contains Name and Bounding Box, maybe for correct scale?
Names are:

```
taillightL_a_LODS0
taillightL_a_LODS0
taillightL_a_LODS0
taillightL_a_LODS0
taillightL_a_LODS0
taillightL_a_LOD1
taillightL_a_LOD1
taillightL_a_LOD1
taillightL_a_LOD1
taillightL_a_LOD1
taillightL_a_LOD1
taillightL_a_LOD2
taillightL_a_LOD2
taillightL_a_LOD2
taillightL_a_LOD2
taillightL_a_LOD2
taillightL_a_LOD2
taillightL_a_LOD3
taillightL_a_LOD3
taillightL_a_LOD3
taillightL_a_LOD3
taillightL_a_LOD3
taillightL_a_LOD3
taillightL_a_LOD4
taillightL_a_LOD4
taillightL_a_LOD4
taillightL_a_LOD4
taillightL_a_LOD5
taillightL_a_LOD5
Shadow
Shadow
Shadow
Shadow
Shadow
Shadow
Shadow
Shadow
Shadow
Shadow
Shadow
Shadow
Shadow
Shadow
Shadow
Shadow
```

So, we have 6 lods and 6 submeshes for higher lods, note matching with number of materials, I think in older converters these submeshes would get names like:
taillightL_a_LODS0_backfacingGeo
taillightL_a_LODS0_chrome
taillightL_a_LODS0_lights_smooth_CH1_custom_br
taillightL_a_LODS0_lights_smooth_CH1_custom_br_a
taillightL_a_LODS0_lights_smooth_CH1_custom_tailbr
taillightL_a_LODS0_lights_smooth_CH1_custom_tailbr_a

Mesh data parts is most suspicious for separation to submeshes, but I have no experience in reading such data, I cut this data to chunks and compare by pairs, first 4 of Meshes with 217 bytes of data:
[](http://fastpic.ru/view/90/2017/0127/e1a686fa0305116ca1e229e594e636e5.png.html)
And first 4 with 201 bytes of data (Shadow ones):
[](http://fastpic.ru/view/89/2017/0127/5288140af43cfff4b7a3b6b539ce095e.png.html)
These Shadow meshes seems to be missed in Make_H2O output, they skipped or makes unwanted garbage somewhere?..

Next block is IndB data, I have no idea about this, some part of 3D data, maybe named Index Boundary (or Block) - just familiar words, sorry 

Then we have 4 another suspicious data block, named VLay. Suspicious because we have 6 materials, but there's only 4 unique materials in fact, so, this data can be UV-related.
I cut it to chunks and compare by pairs:
[](http://fastpic.ru/view/91/2017/0127/d4d42c7276511d228ca82dbfe635be75.png.html)
Very good words inside, that's all I can say about 

Then we have blocks VerB and MBuf, mixed in some order:
VerB
VerB
MBuf
VerB
VerB
MBuf
VerB
MBuf
VerB
Maybe this order is important...

And last data block is Modl, 16 bytes in lenght, I compare it with one from body_a part:
[](http://fastpic.ru/view/90/2017/0127/ebb382533a7c2c4e6e7e7df2434bc6e5.png.html)
50/50 result, can't say more 

I uploaded archive with working folder for that light here: [http://www.mediafire.com/file/y7kf8a8t6 ... Lights.zip](http://www.mediafire.com/file/y7kf8a8t67f37po/SecondaryLights.zip)
With all textures linked in materials, also converted to PNG.


Upd: It's very possible, than all data blocks must be cutted out from Grub archive, to make byte addressing inside them "local", for getting good matches with Mesh data etc.

No, it's not. Use plugin from Intel: [https://software.intel.com/en-us/articl ... rks-plugin](https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/intel-texture-works-plugin)
Friend of mine successfully installed it to CS3 x86 (if you don't have CS6 or higher).
For selecting which plugin is used, nVidia or Intel, use "Open as..." dialogue and select one from file types dropdown list.

I have problem with latest version of converter. The last one worked fine was version f. In latest ones the tool stop responding then crash after working few minutes leaving me huge file that weights couple of Gb. Is that normal?

Just put the interior parts in first then convert it to obj the do the same with others




Am stuck on converting textures on this step here.

Just copy chunk part to filename of already existing file with "header_only", this dialog pop ups instead of standard windows "overwrite/cancel".
You can edit destination name after [F5] is pressed in first pop up window.
See more examples at the end of tutorial.

Great news! 
Really bored to do that by hands 

Upd: I think you will need a mipmaps counter byte, because images with only one mipmap require slightly different DX10 DDS header.
I found this byte at Pos: 5Ah in swatchbin header. Also, images with only one mipmap, seems to have Data start position as 8Ch.

You miss one step, you need to delete all data in yours 1024x512xBC7.dds and save remaining header data as 1024x512xBC7_header_only.dds (or use 1024x512xBC7_header_only.dds from attached archive).

Then you have two ways - type or copy/paste text "1024x512xBC7_header_only.dds", removing "for_crownvictoria_10_doortags_diff_(bla-bla-bla).1024x512xBC7" in your dialogue on the screenshot. But it's a "demo way" from tuto 
Better way is making a copy of your 1024x512xBC7_header_only.dds file, then rename it to for_crownvictoria_10_doortags_diff_(bla-bla-bla).dds (by copypasting from chunk name), then, in dialogue from your screenshot, you just removes "1024x512xBC7" from the end of chunk name and type "dds" instead (in most cases it's automagically spawns as suggested name, because there's already a file in this folder with same name - yours renamed DX10 DDS header).

And do not use "Overwrite" in next dialogue window, use "Other>Append" option.

Data start position of data to be collected is detected automatically from swatchbin header, while the data bytes (without swatchbin header) are collected from data-start-position-index to the end of swatchbin file.
As of now, I just have dx10 headers in external files sorted by dimension. (1024x1024, 1024x512, 2048x2048...) where the correct texture compression type will be written after data collection of these headers.
About mipmaps: Does the mipmap counter shares the same location in dx10 headers as well ?

For DX10 it's position is 1Ch, but there's other changes always present:
[](http://fastpic.ru/view/90/2017/0127/b24d05b906f329f0f11521e543c9fb0b.png.html)
Bytes at positions 6Ch and 6Eh, plus unknown counter at pos. 15h.

Maybe [here](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/bb943983%28v=vs.85%29.aspx) you can get some clues...

I dont have this problem in version "i1".
My modelbins.txt contains only one link to body_a, and the result is:
[](http://fastpic.ru/view/90/2017/0128/d5bab2de6901c0ecbb59fdfd6b426b40.png.html)
Nothing unwanted is attached to LODS0 parts, as far i can see, but some unwanted splitting occurs.

Upd: But, if i put some random materials to different parts, some errors becomes visible:

Maybe first part it's 2 vertex coordinates for 2 corner vertices of plane? Like for bounding boxes.
And second part is transform or simple planar mapping?
They probably dont have UV maps, and this can be a clue where to find UVs for lods meshes, because of differencies mentioned earlier:

I don't really need those shadows, just curious about why there's 16 of them for a single back light?..
They can be just a dummies for holding positions for light glow effect (lots of LEDs).

Yeah, it's not a big problem for sure 

But what about possible wrong reading of meshes in updated part of my post?..

Tested BMW_i8_15 body_a mesh with "gc" version of "Make_H2O":
[](http://fastpic.ru/view/90/2017/0128/0799ad8bed00d4cc8c92664923354158.png.html)
A lot more pieces of LODS0 here, but first and last ones have errors in splitting.
First one is with "concrete" material on my pic, and last one is selected and highlighted.
First have pieces of roof and "invisible" parts and last one have piece of body and "invisible" part of LOD1.

Not sure about "wrong detached", but it looks wrong scaled by one axis, but my result from "gc" version looks more or less proportional:

(top ortho projection)

Version from "i1" output have exactly the same proportions:

Your doing a great job here, Andrakann,   but to be honest, I don't have the time to read/understand that all.

It's too complex for me and sooner or later ForzaStudio will be updated, I'm pretty sure.
Atm I feel finished, more or less. I'll try to improve the mapping, though, from time to time.

btw: you might try to uncomment "extra-groups" (delete the '#') in the obj file. Doesn't make sense though,
if it follows another g-line directly like here:
g body_a_000
#g body_a_1_ex

Mapping looks not really important for this models, because it seems like there's no textured parts, except gauges and livery.
Other parts uses shader materials without maps, and UVs for them can be any - converted or re-generated in 3d software.
But those errors in splitting parts is more disturbing...

This could be healed easily by joining the parts manually (ctrl+J in blender). If I reduced unwanted splits, many wanted splits would be lost; I have little control about that, since it's just a simple stupid brute force algo used for it.
(What could be done is a free choice of params: threshold and meshsize; I'll think about that.)

There's wanted splits missing in first and last meshes of LODS0.
But i missed version "j" 
Anyway, here's this body_a: [http://www.mediafire.com/file/4nga2gnyq ... body_a.zip](http://www.mediafire.com/file/4nga2gnyqjbsf9m/BMW_i8_15_body_a.zip)

Upd: In version "j" first mesh looks good:
[](http://fastpic.ru/view/89/2017/0128/8152ded543e1a298ea15ccec0b674a4a.png.html)
Part of LODS0 for matte black material (invisible).

But last part of LODS0 (for carpaint material) merged with some polys from first part of LOD1 (black/invisible):
[](http://fastpic.ru/view/91/2017/0128/e445b010b540a66026a0368e85ac5fd1.png.html)
(i select some of them here, light magenta highlighted)

Only one part is commented, and it splits bottom part (probably black/invisible) from grille background part (black/invisible too):
[](http://fastpic.ru/view/89/2017/0128/bdcb50ef5b5d4ecb461365c405007ee9.png.html)
(and they have UV layout for different maps, so it's better to split them)

btw: meanwhile I found that I already had a "solution" for the problem but the code line was commented out because it led to an infinite loop.  
(I placed the 'g missing' line manually)

gosh; I've solved it (too ridiculous, missed a "+1"):

f 26433/26433 26432/26432 20308/20308 
g BMW_i8_15-body_a_044
f 20329/20329 20308/20308 26432/26432
f 1127/1127 1128/1128 1129/1129 

But I've got 79 groups now; I'll have to check that.

well, this will take some time. There's some senseful new groups (maybe):

f 6658/6658 7065/7065 7066/7066 
f 6657/6657 6658/6658 7066/7066

BMW_i8_15 body_a.modelbin has 52 submeshes inside (without Shadow ones), so it's not a big fragmentation i think...

I'm checking gauges mesh of FOR_RangerT6_14, looks like UVs is good (just unscaled a little), but only one mesh is produced by "j":
[](http://fastpic.ru/view/90/2017/0128/74fd94d9153c95843eacd52f383576fe.png.html)
5 materials found inside gaugeCluster_a.modelbin:
digitalgauge
gauge_001
paint_gold
screw_002
steel
And 5 Meshes (+ 2 Shadow meshes).
I uncomment all meshes inside gaugeCluster_a.obj, but it split out only this small (but detailed) thing:
[](http://fastpic.ru/view/90/2017/0128/6481c49eed24a0bf4a66ee6e3944cb42.png.html)
I think your newer version of Make_H2O produce better result for splitting, i will wait till it's done

UV is also right, but flipped vertically.

Not me, sorry, maybe someone else do it, who's figured it out and have time for making videos...

Or maybe zwrtron share his tool.

So as you may noticed, I've developing Java texture conversion tool (together Tado Hmn) to convert textures from .SWATCHBIN to DirectX10 DirectDraw-Surface .dds, surprisingly its called 'SWATCHBIN2DDS".

As of now, according to @Andrakann 's great texture conversion guide, the tools is currently able to do following:
• As java can only read file bytes, we were forced to write our own, in-built hexidecimal editor from scratch!
• Collect data from SWATCHBIN file required to create new generic dx10 dds header.
  (texture width, height, compression, mipmaps, data start)
• Writes collected data to generic dx10 dds header loaded as an instance to the tool.
• Cuts data apart from SWATCHBIN according to collected data-start value index to the end of data flow.
• Generates .dds image to the directory with SWATCHBIN containing bytes from newlty generated dx10 dds header instance and cutted (data-only) bytes from SWATCHBIN file.
• can convert all SWATCHBIN files from folder to DDS in one go.

- currently only standard resolution type textures are supported: 64^2, 128^2, 256^2, 512^2 ....
- has no UI at moment so...

But however, the tool is not ready to be released as BETA yet, because we need to discover differences between DX10 dds headers as mentioned by Andrakann in this post:

> Reply from Andrakann
>
> 
For DX10 it's position is 1Ch, but there's other changes always present:

Bytes at positions 6Ch and 6Eh, plus unknown counter at pos. 15h.

Maybe here you can get some clues...

So if anyone could provide some informations, please pm me.

well, long story short: quicksort seems to be the solution. (now, it wasn't! see version j2 and ignore this post)

I thought of quicksorting the faceindices from the very beginning but for some unknown reason 
I feared there'd be a reason for their scrambling and Qsort would spoil erverything.

gosh, it didn't.
Only problem is the multitexture for the body_a4 submesh.
Still no clue how to separate them other than manually placing "g forced_submesh_a4_x" lines.

(Also I've the strange feeling that we need to figure out the difference between material submeshes
and lod submeshes.)

Be informed that the quicksort version can handle ONE modelbin file only so far.

You wouldn't believe about the simplicity of the code used for creating the groups, would you?

```
            quickSort((int*)FImedian, (int*)indArr, 0, FIcnt/3) ;
            cntEx= 0 ;
            for (i=0;i<FIcnt/3;i++) {
                a= FIarr[0][indArr[i]] ; b= FIarr[1][indArr[i]] ; c= FIarr[2][indArr[i]] ;
                if (((a+b+c)/3 > dwUVsum[cntEx])&&(cntEx<cntMax)) {     // next Material-Submesh
                    _itoa(cntEx, szNo, 10) ;                            //
                    strcpy(szFileName, szTmp) ; strcat(szFileName, szNo) ;
                    if (bUV_28[cntEx+1]) strcat(szFileName, "_UVB28") ;   // +1, warum auch immer
                    fprintf( stream, "g %s\n", szFileName) ;
                    cntEx++ ;
                }
                fprintf( stream, "f %d/%d %d/%d %d/%d\n", a,a, b,b, c,c) ;
            }
```

Output for BMW_i8_15_body_a is very messy for me, looks like all lods for meshes put in one mesh.. 

Upd: I move them a little vertically for this pic, only lowest LOD seems to be separated:

you mean body_a_4?
If so, my fears come true: qsort merges the lods?

I'm sorry to say, that I don't have a clue how to fix that other than using previous versions of the exe (-gc, -j).
Reason is that the different algos are incompatible, i.e. I can't "mix" them.

Yes, it's merges them, but a little strange:
(another strange thing is i copied this part list from search results for "g" in NP++ and there's missing first mesh in list with weird (autogenerated?) name "object #0" - copied it from DE)
object #0 -  lods0-4 for black material
body_a_0 - lod5 for black material
body_a_UVB28_1 - lods0-5 for black material undergrille mesh
body_a_2 - lods0-4 for black/undercarriage material
body_a_3 - lod5 for black/undercarriage material
body_a_4 - lods0-4 for dark carpaint material
body_a_5 - lod5 for dark carpaint material
body_a_6 - lods0-4 for light carpaint material
body_a_7 -lod5 for light carpaint material

I don't know how hard to do it, but is your tool can see mesh is lod, or no? maybe you can just skip lods? just for test of course, and then split meshes by materials. j version merge lods in this lamborghini like: glass (3 lods), body_a (one lod) and in some meshes like bumpers, hood, trunk, lods contains parts of lod0 meshes.

Anyway, thanks for this big job that you do.

> j version merge lods in this lamborghini like: glass (3 lods), body_a (one lod) and in some meshes like bumpers, hood, trunk, lods contains parts of lod0 meshes.-j uses a brute force algorithm, as already mentioned several times. It creates 3 (to 10) times more groups than the qsort algo (which mostly produces exact borders) but in most cases -j doesn't hit the border between groups exactly.

There's a single line in the -j algo that "switches" between 3 and 10 times. But the later produces a bunch of superfluous groups
(guess, most people wouldn't like that).

Best results I got was gathering some "g" lines from a "-j x3" created obj file and inserting them manually into a -q created obj file.

Isn't the Forza model an Acura and LHD? Theirs is an RHD Honda. I doubt it's from FH3.

Acura NSX '16 from gamemodels.ru
and
YCA NSX are 100% same (3d models)

Cant check the texture as i still havent got it to work but would be nice to compare. Quick pic taken:

I think the uvmaps are ok (BMW_i8_15, exterior), more or less, it's a matter of manually inserting grouping lines so far:

I'm not sure if this issue is already noticed or not, but on some cars that i have tried exporting, the dashstructure and dashpad are usually misscaled, seems like the dashpad is following the steeringwheel scale and dashstructure is just plain wrong, here is some pics and the problematic files (dashpad and dash structure from 86 Audi Quattro).

Didn't know about the dash, but I consider it as a minor issue (as for the moveable parts I can't change it atm).

> and dashstructure is just plain wrongI'm no car expert, how should it look?

There's some major problem with separating uv maps when joining a_1000_ex and a_2000_ex to a_2000_ex
some unwanted map parts to appear ("ex" means autocreated modulo 1000):

The map in the bottom pic looks better but for some strange reason only a quarter of the mesh is selected.

Hey, I just want to share progress from swatchbin2dds conversion tool development.
Currently, it's still not ready to be released as public beta, because it needs an user interface.

Features:
 • Convert any swatchbin file from Forza Horizon 3 or Forza Motorsport 6 Apex to DirectX10 DirectDraw-Surface (.dds), where
  - any resolution, compression, mipmap level texture is supported
 • Supports bulk conversion of all swatchbin in folder or simple one-by-one

Currently the only way ahead is to code simple UI for public beta release. However, any ideas how to improve anything are appreciated.

yeah suspension on nearly all cars are fucked up and not scaled correct, it`s a shame 

but remember that this tool is not finished ^^

Very nice work man when will you release because not all of us know how to convert switchbin's to dds.

First public beta could be released within this week. I am not sure how long will take to write UI and handle possible errors.
It will also require performance tweak, as of Java Virtual Machine is well known for memory limitations. Currently it transfers up to ~ 10 MB per second (including time to write to hard drive as dds).

I continue digging modelbin format 
[First part](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?p=126552#p126552).
[Second part](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?p=126817#p126817).

Now i focused on 3D data parts, patient is the same AST_DB11_17 taillightL_a.modelbin.

IndB, VerB and Mbuf data parts have very similar headers 16 bytes in lenght, this is how they looks in decimal numbers:

```
	(just a counter added)
			Entries Count (DWORD)
						Data length in bytes (DWORD)
										Block size in bytes (WORD)
												Units in one block? (WORD)
															Unknown (DWORD)
IndB	 	7620		30480		 4		1		42
VerB	1	2541		20328		 8		1		13
VerB	2	1037		16592		16		4		37
Mbuf	1	1037		16592		16		2		10
VerB	3	  12		  192		16		4		37
VerB	4	 472		11328		24		6		37
Mbuf	2	 472		 7552		16		2		10
VerB	5	 986		27608		28		7		37
Mbuf	3	 986		15776		16		2		10
VerB	6	  34		  952		28		7		37

```

([better table is here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1yveToP90jzNJF4Lf7O71JbTxfCkXqnb6U68qRCXQjng/edit?usp=sharing))

VerB 1 have 2541 entries, and VerB 2-6 have the same amount in sum, but data blocks is different. I don't know what it means, maybe it's important...

Second half of 16 bytes long Modl data is identical to one from body_a.modelbin, and in first part we can find a four 2-byte words, containing numbers: 46, 10, 4, 6
I think 46 it's a count of Mesh entries in this modelbin, 10 is unknown (it's 13 for body_a), 4 seems to be VLay entries count and 6 it's a count of material entries.

And finally the most interesting part - Mesh data digging:
Some comparison pics for normal meshes and shadow ones (header part only):
[](http://fastpic.ru/view/90/2017/0130/ef48e507d8644eeb78aa4c837da1e430.png.html) [](http://fastpic.ru/view/90/2017/0130/594ca96e124c4f7e1c3d9ddd751444a1.png.html)
This time i cut out data with additional 00 00 00 at start, for better formatting by DWORDs.

Some numbers match with ones from AST_DB11_17_taillightL_a-j.obj, this give me first clues, and i finished with this table:
[](http://fastpic.ru/view/90/2017/0130/fc6b26e2d4e996c39367ad96fb49617a.png.html)
([better table is here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-D-LFWumW70ued0O13eAi18t6KjMoPYgb-KN8IcntTo/edit?usp=sharing) and [latest is here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14X-zIQORPpOoSzIOmLlWJQsm0g8e-7MGxe7Id3pr8ws/edit?usp=sharing))
Note that order for "Fist data byte" values is differs for LODS0 and LODs 1-5.
First mesh in table have same verts and faces count as taillightL_a_001 mesh in AST_DB11_17_taillightL_a-j.obj

Those strange hashes have matches with some of "shadow" meshes. Low detail parts share same hashes, even if other parameters differs.
I tried to find matches for lower hash in that part folder, and found it:
[](http://fastpic.ru/view/89/2017/0130/9e04b7ac2cc342cda04787cb945316d2.png.html)
Then i tried in whole scene folder:
[](http://fastpic.ru/view/90/2017/0130/de40762b4bc341c0db10d15817671138.png.html)
Lots of hits, but not much logic...
For detailed lod hash there's only hits with taillightR_a.modelbin, maybe those hashes are just data size of meshes in hashed form?..

Anyway, I hope this information and table of meshes is helps to make new algo for separation of meshes in Make_H2O 

Working folder is uploaded here (tables, obj's, chunks, modeldins).

In my table for Meshes i skipped 32 bytes in header, and there's one DWORD in them, looking very important, so i update my table:
[](http://fastpic.ru/view/90/2017/0131/f401d00f3c0de295f3a57244b18c6c3a.png.html)
([better version is here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_cOIQzGbN-YsnaXA62FaC0ag68oFjQAW5oRYxGM5WI8/edit?usp=sharing))

And about "Shadow" meshes - i think it's some sort of "detachable" 3-rd UV map for fake "AO shadows" with textures.
Devs make it detachable for skipping loading of them if game settings set to "Abmient Occlusion: off".

Upd: How this table looks if sorted by that new value, without and with shadow meshes:
[](http://fastpic.ru/view/91/2017/0131/dc766f08496d7d8efa0c9b79c08ecb32.png.html) [](http://fastpic.ru/view/91/2017/0131/db1b77f521a6dfcec405ac04d1018584.png.html)
This order of meshes matches with order in OBJ from "j" version, as far as i can see.

I'm no car expert, how should it look?

Here's an example from AUD quattro (also found on some other cars, (FER_250gt_60,FER_330p4,NIS_Silvia_66).

Here's how it (roughly) should look like


And here's how it looks straight from importing


Seems like it's scaled to the dials(?), if so then it might be hard to fix because of the problem with movable parts as you mentioned.

That's minor problem.
I think scale and position of some parts is more important. It's never the same when moving a hand the parts

I am going to say not before it's ready but defiantly after it's ready.   

Thought i might as well add to the useless comments.

Still ahead of tool which output model with materials, Lamborghini made for Assetto Corsa, in total, guys: manually carved out lods, meshes taken using version j. Known issues (most likely the same on many models), wipers, not all, only 1(but real lambo have 2 variations), dashpad wrong scale and position (also was attached to steeringwheel), model is mirrored, door speakers have some unknown mesh in there.

UPD. Thank you guys again for work on it.

hope, version j2 will make texturing a lot easier (no manual grouping required)
This was possible because of the amazing work of Andrakann!

WARNING: split your filelist into exterior and interior for example
or you'll experience a significant blender slow down because of too many groups.

For BMW_i8_15, exterior, for example, automatic grouping seems to be ok.

All LOD submeshes are separated but you've to select the LODs manually,
for example DB11, taillightL, LODS0 and LOD1:

LODS0: taillightL_a_000 to taillightL_a_005
LOD1: taillightL_a_006 to taillightL_a_011

Few uv maps and AUD_Quattro dashstructure for example still spoiled.

@shakotay2

I just tested the J2 version on the Audi RS2. I get an error saying "too many faces in AUD_RS2_95_skeleton.modelbin, then I get the standard Windows "*exe* has stopped working" message.

Here's the file it complained about if you want to investigate.

Sorry, it was my mistake to try and use the whole scene folder instead of trying to delete what wasn't used.

Removing it works perfectly though, thanks.

Grouping looks spot on so far. Will test with some others.
Thanks Andrakann and shakotay2.  

EDIT1: Interior groups are okay on the SVR. Still had to scale the top of the dash and steering column which is a 1 min job as the scaling is joined between the pair.
EDIT2: Ran into a problem with the Ferrari 355 doorLF_a.modelbin just crashes when trying to load the modelbins.txt.

On import the scale i use is 0.7813. As you can see in the picture below it's spot on with the old forza model.
I have only done this with the BMW 1M so far but if they all use the same reference for the scale they should all be fine i suppose.

dunno, if you know: 0.078125 = 200.0/256.0, btw

Since a scale of 0.02 was my suggested scale for blender import I used 4.0/256.0 now. [edit]

I had been hoping someone else (other than Andrakann and me) would take up the skeleton.modelbin analysing for example.
(It's small files so should not be too hard.)

The more annoying thing is the remaining uv issues, but that would need more time/motivation to solve:

So next thing on the list is the material names.

Wow, after a few years not viewing the forum, there is finally some breakthrough in Forza files! Awesome!

However, I am on Windows7 Home x64 and have downloaded FH3 for cars.
The file is eappx. Anyone can explain how to unpack it or is it difficult?
Or anyone can upload all cars? Probably too much to ask.

dunno, if you know: 0.078125 = 200.0/256.0, btw

Since a scale of 0.02 was my suggested scale for blender import I used 4.0/256.0
Sorry i must have missed that post. Good to know now anyway thanks.

As soon as I know a simple method how to get the material counts for the lods I'll try to understand "groups and parenting".

I just wanted to express that I followed your scaling rule. Now.

btw: version jms seems to do an unwanted texture mirroring; tried to fix it -> version jmsc

(It's small files so should not be too hard.)
It's really not hard 
If you mean Skel data in modelbins.
First WORD of data block is number of bones, then DWORD with name lenght for first bone, then name of this bone, then some bytes looks like connection order, then ~4 coordinate for each bone. And again - DWORD with bone name lenght, name itself, etc.
Main problem here is connection to meshes, bone names doesn't match mesh names, so i have no idea how to connect single meshes or complete meshbins to that bones.
How bones looks like splitted to separate files, starting from name lenght DWORD:

(ignore text zeroes here, i add them to end of names for better formatting by DWORDs)

meshes like doors, hood, trunk, etc have dummy, i think just need to know coords of bones then give this pos to dummies, somthing like that?

Dummies can be created at skeleton coordinates, yes.
If you then look at those dummies, figure out which where, then manually align pivot points of misplaced parts to them - you can complete model.
But for pre-align at convert stage, we need some clues, or, maybe, make an "atlas" of connections (or find where it is in game).
Something like: "doorHandleLF_a" aligns to "boneDoorLF coordinates #1 (2,3,4?)".
And repeat this for every sub-part name, but atm those sub-parts doesn't have ingame names.

PS: AFAIK, obj-format can't store skeletal information, so, only pre-aligning parts to it's skeletal coordinates can be made as maximum.

sry, forget to mention that I logged already skeleton data 3 weeks ago;
would have made an smd from it but was too busy with dozens of other issues.
strange skeleton, most bones "parented to 01 00"?  (=1, root)
Couldn't make sense of the assumed parenting (words), for example hubLF: 01 00 07 00  08 00,
hubLR: 01 00 09 00  0A 00, why 3 numbers?


Bone numbers from 0 to 36, seems to be ok.

Oh, now it's clearier where to find this "skeleton.modelbin" 
But you have strange numbers in front of bones in list.
Skeleton part of "skeleton.modelbin" is identical to Skel part in other modelbins for the same car.
But there's also Modl and BBox added.

Most interesting thing here it's a .gr2 copy of this skeleton, located in same folder. I have Granny Viewer and this .gr2 file loads just fine.
Now we can see how this skeleton looks like:
[](http://fastpic.ru/view/90/2017/0205/f119fae71a3f0bfd202749ac29f32304.png.html) [](http://fastpic.ru/view/90/2017/0205/aaf82436f96b820f21749c4f5a601e6d.png.html) [](http://fastpic.ru/view/90/2017/0205/1b41f731a85c517f7814893aa7bcd782.png.html)

I also found some sort of "atlas" we need:
[](http://fastpic.ru/view/89/2017/0205/d158aa34adf30eeb406617493062cba2.png.html)
But i can extract only the right part of this list from memory dump, and only text is here, separated by 00h bytes.
I replaced those zeroes to line end symbols and attached result as text list.

PS: Done quick sorting for this list, more detailed sorting and structuring can be done easy enough, if need.

Dummy is an "empty" object, placeholder for coordinate.
We have only objects itself, detached from skeleton.

Try to scale skeleton with values discussed [here](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?p=127200#p127200).


[New version of 3DSimED](http://sim-garage.co.uk/software-release/3dsimed-3-1g-released/) got basic swatchbin support (Tools>Texture browser), but crashes often.

DDS is lossy format, i think this conversion recompress texture, not just adds header.
So, it's better to wait for sb2dds - it's almost done

tested. as i can see, 3dsimed described above converts textures to dds like a sharm, but your tool converts all textures like this one.

Recompress from high quality BC7 compression to old ugly DXT5 compression, yeah "like a sharm":

Maybe you can't see quality loss, but i see it clearly, and this just unacceptable.
Conversion to PNG directly crashes 3DSimED (atm), but you can convert to TGA and see difference.

sb2dds has been updated to version 0.34

What has changed since 0.32 ?

 • Added support for swatchbins with BC4_SNORM and BC5_SNORM compression
 • The generic DDS header is no more in data folder, but has been loaded to application instead (increased portability)
 • Tool will automatically rescale texture canvas to match modulo 4 division for width and height (some applications and games require it)
 • Now it's possible to save your preferences (settings), where the preferences are loaded on tool startup

> Reply from dimon4ik6565

> tested. as i can see, 3dsimed described above converts textures to dds like a sharm, but your tool converts all textures like this one. • Updated readMe file, hope its now more visible.

I gave the bone a test and the scale doesn't seem to match unless i'm being stupid. Which is most likely.   
Has anyone managed to have any success with these.

> and the scale doesn't seem to matchare you sure that it's a matter of scale?
Did you move the doors manually to their correct positon to check their scale?
For DB11 it seems the size of the door (DB11, doorHandleLF_a-LodS0_006) is ok.
The position is the problem and as I wrote earlier: the positions of all moveable parts need corrections so far.

Another thingie is the overall scale. Actually I did how you told me. But Andrakann said some model being twice too big.
edit: ok, scaled down 0.5 now

Made some improvement to the lod naming (version j2l).

using j2l obj with blender
-------------------------
(blender is a little bit tricky (but it's free!) especially when it comes to outliner selections.)

THE REASON WHY it doesn't seem to work "custom" is that it takes care of which object was selected first.
Which other apps don't do in most cases.

So here we go (be sure nothing is selected neither in the outliner nor in 3D view, 
press A to select/deselect everything):
press B in the outliner
use the rectangled box to select all LodS0 groups for example
(left MB clicked, then release)
right click into selected box, choose select
in 3D view see what happens
with mouse cursor in 3D view press G and move selected

once you've understood the philosophy behind it it works like a charm!
(You might be required to deselect the highlighted (white) group name.)

The names seem to work like a charm.   
Made a planer of the official dimensions of the Aston DB11. The model is indeed twice as big as the real world dimensions.
As you see you have to double the dimensions for forza horizon 3.
Aston Martin DB11 
Length       4,739 mm (187 in)
Width        2,060 mm (81 in)
BMW 1M
Length     4,380 mm (172.4 in)
Width      1,803 mm (71 in)
Forza Horizon 3 model
[](https://www.mediafire.com/view/?68s2ia668fmfv1o)
Forza  Horizon 2 model
[](https://www.mediafire.com/view/?5c116v1mqg5irxx)
So the bones work fine when the model is scaled to 50 percent which is understandable now. 
FYI the right side was already wrong before using the bones.

Just aligned the other parts and found a couple issues.
The hood and truck are slightly offset to the center line. Also the wing is vertical on import, i guess that's wrong like all other moving parts at the moment.
The body, rear bumper, front bumper etc are all on the center line fine.

EDIT: To make things more clear the trunk is fine on initial import it's bang on the center line. As for the hood that's way to the left of the center line on initial import. Then to the right after aliment as you see in the pic.

The hood and truck are slightly offset to the center line.
DB11 have a slightly broken skeleton, maybe it's because this car is unreleased at moment of dev version leaked.
Hood and trunk bones moved, but childrens looks at good place:

Other car skeletons i checked have bones in normal positions.

I think best solution for this case is editing values in .dae file, change matrix for those bones.
Update: Bad idea, childrens moves also.
Better solution:

Just tryed with the CAD_ATSV_16 and that has the problem to aswell as the doors are offset. Was that an unreleased car as well as i don't know?

and what about gamedb.slt? There is table called CarPartPositions, it worked in previous Forzas for brakediscs and wheels.

Fantastic update of the tool. Now it's so easy to separate lods, thank you.

Ok, moving hood bone to center doesn't fix this problem, aligned hood not in place, just moves ~50% closer.

But i found working solution, and it's easy peasy 
That stupid skeleton just mirrored by X, like cars before fixing - driver wheel bone on the right side, but ingame it's left sided:

Hood_a pivot is also not in X-center, and after mirroring the skeleton everything aligns right in place:

I will give that a try thanks.
Here are the new files for the Aston and Cadillac, they are different size so thought i'd upload.
Aston

EDIT updated aston link, also it's the files size that's different not the scale of the models

Is it the doors, the fenders, the hood?

I would have to look and see where those textures are used to be able to say.
Though wasn't it said there is a couple of polys that go over the body that users those textures.

As for the alignment issue i tried what you said and still didn't work. So not to sure what you're doing that i'm not.
I gave the Audi R8 a try but still the same problem. Initial import is fine it's dead center and it's own pivot point is dead center.
So when you set the offset to parent dummy that is not dead center it clearly is going to be off center no matter if you mirror them.
Also i am having issues with the right door on what seems to be all cars now, is anyone else getting that?

Been applying textures to the lights and it seems we really need UV2 or possibly UV3 i don't no how many layers they have, to make them work.
Thought i'd mention it even though you are working on other things at the moment.

The texture tool doesn't seem to work with textures that are used for digital gauges. It does load what appers to be the gear numbers but nothing else.

So when you set the offset to parent dummy that is not dead center it clearly is going to be off center no matter if you mirror them.
Not sure what you tries to do, but i do this:
1. Select part you need to align.
2. Activate Align tool.
3. Select target bone dummy.
[](http://fastpic.ru/view/89/2017/0208/b0081a1fef5d60029ccd02f02aa5d8fe.png.html)
Works just fine:
[](http://fastpic.ru/view/89/2017/0208/639b6abd7a58aaf0558dacc4c7c90d4e.png.html)
(also works for groups of objects, but you must move group pivot to zero coordinates, before aligning)

> Also i am having issues with the right door on what seems to be all cars now, is anyone else getting that?
Yes, doorlf_a seems to be incorrect, maybe it's conversion problem, something close to wrong scaling problem for some parts?..
Right door parts is too far from pivot point:
[](http://fastpic.ru/view/90/2017/0208/1cf68c7c5e5c8f19b3ca14c01ca10b0e.png.html)
Must be like this, i think:

It's a bug in latest version of tool (or last two).

I found you made v-flip for UVs 
Looks good, but scale is wrong, looks like it maximized to fill all UV and goes oversized:
[](http://fastpic.ru/view/91/2017/0208/25d204cfb35facd80bd502ad0e93f5b2.png.html)
And this is "Shadow" UV3 i think, in UV1 here must be something for livery texture

There's too much UVs for this Ford, in LiveryMask folder we have masks for one UV-layout, but Livery texture have another UV-layout:
[](http://fastpic.ru/view/89/2017/0208/fecabff064d7b57b509d81acde34ae50.png.html) [](http://fastpic.ru/view/89/2017/0208/2ecae86e915a4a7717580c7da2e72078.png.html)
(i compose all livery masks into one file here)

So, it's a really good news about export for different UVs, because there's a lots of questions unsolved

@Andrakann I have updated the link to the Aston. Also the alignment now seems to work, i must have been doing some thing wrong last night.

@shakotay2 That it great news about the UVs as like i said it seems we need them.  

@viruscn use the attached file and load it in Advanced Renamer and you will see what the names are.
Also if you are going to rename large amounts of files i had to turn windows search/indexing for it to work correctly.

Why don't you guys just download the files that are ready to use right away.

Hey there!
Just want to note that we just updated sb2dds to 0.35 with following improvements:
 • Added support for swatchbins with TXQU headers ( ex.: Forza 6 Apex liveries )
 • Fixed issue with rescaling non-BC type compressions ( fix for @minime891 problem )
 • Removed pointless possibility to save preferences
 • Removed pointless file choosers
 • Preferences are no more in another window, it's much more simpler to change them for different task needs
 • Completely core rebuild with the best possible data reading/writing methods  (59% performance increase on huge tasks compared to 0.34)
 • It is no more possible to start new task while one is already running
 • New interface
 • Built-in user manual

Performance test snippet:

```
0.35 2:14 (134 seconds) avg. ~12.8 MB/s
0.34 3:45 (225 seconds) avg. ~7.6 MB/s

```

EDIT:
I've tried that "modelbin-digging-thing" series by Andrakann to list all references to textures from a modelbin and then from its materialbins. See quick video.

hello there.

I found a little bit bug with Make_H2O-ForzaHor J2l.

when you export something new with j2l you'll find the bumperr is missing.but it won't happen using J2ms.maybe we could fix it in the next version.

all in one,thanks the author,@shakotay2.

Hello there!
Just want to keep you informed that we are currently working on Modelbin Textures Extractor which was introduced yesterday. (For those who missed : [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2skjOCwDf-8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2skjOCwDf-8))

'Materialbin Textures Collector' (will be internal part of above) allow to programmatically read specified materialbin(s) for swatchbin entries. The tool will find collected swatchbins on specified path (hard drive) and copies them to directory with materialbin.
This allows to quickly get swatchbins required to texture a modelbin. These swatchbins can be converted to dds textures using sb2dds.

How is this done ?:
 • The 'sub-tool' will list all materialbins in specified directory
 • Collects swatchbin path entries from each materialbin
 • Finds swatchbins on hard drive using path collected from materialbin (path to game files is specified)
 • Put all swatchbins to subfolders where the materialbin is

Almost forgot to note, that the whole process take less than a few seconds!

Hope you like

That's a very nice feature indeed and a much needed one imo for the way the textures are set up this time round.

Another round of modelbin format digging 
[First part](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?p=126552#p126552).
[Second part](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?p=126817#p126817).
[Third part](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?p=127004#p127004).

Today focus is VLay and IndB data structure.

VLay is "Vertex data Layout" i think.
VLay data structure is:
Header entry with Id number.
Main data entry:

```

DWord - Name 1 lenght in X-bytes
X-bytes - Name 1 string
DWord - Name 2 lenght in bytes
X-bytes - Name 2 string
etc.

Word - Number of data entries

Data entries part 1  (xNumber of data entries):
Word unk. (name number in hex or data type (need to check more samples))
Word unk. (data block number (UV numbers here too))
Word unk. (number of blocks used in IndB)
Word 00 00
DWord unk. (data type?)
DWord FF FF FF FF
Dword 00 00 00 00

Data entries part 2 (xNumber of data entries):
Dword - unk. (data type related)

DWord (or byte byte 00 00) - unk. (VLay type? Matched for identical VLay entries in different modelbins (and cars))
```

How this data looks being sorted into table:
[](http://fastpic.ru/view/90/2017/0213/e987a932fa046fe7619b2b9ed5d9ce66.png.html)
([live version is here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1It5G9Bbg2wyEYXrKqqEg-Zto1-LZnBHCUqNQaeUvADc/edit#gid=1810736220))

Id part gives a way to connect VLay data with VerB blocks:
[](http://fastpic.ru/view/89/2017/0213/d063818f8b1a5dc6cd172ba888ab71ac.png.html)
(same Id for VLay, Verb and MBuf blocks, some of VerB (with lowest LODs) don't have a VLay and MBuf connected (maybe they use empty "FF" VLay))

This looks pretty enough for reading any vertex data we want, like UV1-5, so, it's time to patiently wait for shak-otay comes back (this saturday)

Thanks 
No, but i think it's a step forward. Looks like scaling issues it's not hard, but low priority task, doable after making UV working as indeed.

Hey Guys

Amazing topic ! 

I'm a little lost.. maybe some1 can confirm...

Currently, I'm using H2O to get Obj Meshes. They are mostly merged with all the LOD's. Is there a better way than manually going over mesh and fixing it maybe?

Yes there sure is just use the latest version. It's on the previous page so shouldn't be hard to find.

Awesome thanks !

He gives nice model, is there a way to get a skeleton/rig to know how to re-adjust the doors/etc parts?

Also how do you guys clean up the model? The H20 V1 I could just select all meshes and do merge verticles, But over here when I do that I get weird smoothing groups and errors... How can I merge them properly? -ok Nvm scratch that V1 dont merge either...

So how do you guys merge vertexes to make it smooth? Also should the mesh not have some kind of normals that are baked in ?

Currently its a really big - HAND job to get nice model, read the pages of this topic and you can get it, with skeleton, but mapping, scale and pos of some parts you need to fix manually.

Does Anybody has Fully Assembled or ZModeler file of Nissan Skyline GTS-R R31 Mk.VII '87? (Includes JUST SLOD/LOD0 and Converted Textures aswell)?

I trying get it work on Unity Editor. but it seems it's missing it's Interiors. and few texture UV is wrong.

Thanks,

@brucektrain Asking for a specific model to have all UVs edited manually and textures whilst the tool is still not finished is very unrealistic.

@shakotay2 I have come across a UV that doesn't seem to be restricted to the UV box. The trunkBay_a__SLOD for the Range Rover SVR. 
Has any one else seen this with SLOD parts?

A lot of textures are tiled and tiling info is contained in the material settings.

Tiling is done when the UV expands out of the UV box so i am not sure what you mean there. 

Material settings can cause tiling not to work if you say clamp texture instead of wrap. Maybe you can elaborate on what you mean.

I've been searching high and low for a thread like this. Thank goodness I found you guys.

I'm just doing part swaps between cars in FH3, and I've gone over the previously posted hex code translations very thoroughly, but I still can't figure out which parts of the code to copy between .modelbin files to get it to work. I've gone over every file in each car's .zip and the gamedb to see what determines just assigning a particular part filename to each upgrade (I want to swap exhausts) but arrived at more game crashes and bugs.

you are trying to swap files in game??

It's very possible, D3FEKT has been doing it in FH3 for months now.

EDIT: From what I can gather, changes need to be made to the target .carbin and .modelbin. Here is what I could decipher inside .carbin:



As for .modelbin, I can only guess from Andrakann's findings that the entry reference block needs to also be modified after the swaps between the materials, UV, LOD names, meshes, positioning, and the filesize after these changes had been made. This much is over my head.

D3FEKT, buddy.... you gotta come out of hiding more often.

Main difference between exhaust_a.modelbins for different cars is Skeleton entry. It's the same for all modelbins in car folder (or zip), so, you'll need to put Skel from old part to new one.
Would be easy enough, if new part have same or bigger Skel entry (in bytes) and more difficult if smaller - you'll need to change all adressing in Grub header after Skel entry in this case, because modelbin change it's size to bigger.
Also you need to check all links to swatchbins inside new exhaust_a.modelbin and copy those swatchbins to modified car folder too (only for "local" swatchbins, not for cars\_library\ ones).

And there's a big chance that you'll get new exhaust somewhere behind or inside car body, if length of cars is differs heavily.

Just my thoughs.

Alright, this seems logical. I didn't know if skeleton alone was what needed to be changed, but I did notice different skel references between cars. So far it's just been pasting the other blocks over to see what works. I'll give it a shot soon, thanks

EDIT: I've just spent around... 4 hours in hex editors learning the layout of the file and re-referencing every item's new position in the exhaust.modelbin.... to be met by crushing defeat at the loading screen. So many tears

This was the first thing to pop up, then it comes up with impactmask.swatchbin and so on.

It says compression wrong, are you sure you using the same zip compression as in game?
And what about using extracted folder instead of zip?

Using an extracted folder I was met with this:



Also I have no idea about zip compression settings. I've just been dragging the modified files into the existing zip. I'll have a poke around though.

I just wanted to share Ferrari F12tdf with swatchbins whose paths are found inside its modelbins. The whole thing is done by Modelbin Textures Extractor as shown here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_xZr8B8blUI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_xZr8B8blUI)
(also pleasure to post #1800 post    )

Structure example overview:
Nothing brand new, but let me summarise. Each modelbin file contains at least one materialbin | swatchbin entry. Each materialbin file contains at least one shaderbin or swatchbin entry.

```
 -> swatchbin entries (direct swatchbin texture)
 -> materialbin entries (reference to material container)
   -> shaderbin entries
   -> swatchbin entries

```


Like we shared on our facebook page, we are developing tool to make texture collection a bit simplier.

Materialbin Textures Collector (MTC) is able to:
 - read modelbin file to get material names, materialbin and swatchbin entries.
 - this same for materialbin to get swatchbin entries.
 - find swatchbins from both modelbin and materialbins in game files and copy them to subdirectory of modelbin location.

After process of MTC is done, subdirectory textures_%modelbin_name% should contain ALL textures to fully texture whole modelbin.
This is how it works:


Download Ferrari F12tdf (complete MTC output example) 
[https://drive.google.com/uc?export=down ... lozN1N6R2M](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=0B5-inY9Y2RrtYjdWalozN1N6R2M)

The tool release is pointless IMO, because requires large library of game files to work (22GB collection) so I'm not sure how this tool can come handy.

It would be handy for us who do have the complete files   . Could this tool, instead of actually collecting textures, just make a text list? With like maybe:

```
-screw013ao.swatchbin
-screw013nrm.swatchbin
etc.

```


That would be a big help to me  At the moment I am hex viewing each individual files to find out what the related textures are for each part.

I have to agree with SoniKalien it will be very handy as many of us do have all the files required. 

And i too have been doing this manually. So i do hope for a release.

It's not the only problem the williams have. door miscaled, hard part to disasemble from multiple LOD...

But i managed to do it maybe you want the .z3d ?

Hi guys, I was reading this thread for a while but this is my first post, I think you are making an awesome work 

I'm trying to make a tool through Houdini engine that can automatically process the cars, scaling and placing the parts, assigning materials and textures, fixing UVs, creating and placing wheels, calipers etc..

The end result will be a car configurator that would let you decide what parts you want (hoods, bumpers...) and give you a clean perfect mesh

My problem now is that I can't make anything work :/ probably I'm doing something wrong, I'm getting problems with bones on every car
I would love if someone can tell me how to do it, or direct me to some tutorial 

Thank you very much guys!!!!

Wow great to hear that. Will it also split mesh in LODs like ForzaStudio ?

yep TomWin, actually it already do it, also select what model you want for each part, like hood, bumpers, wings...
now I need the skeleton to place the parts and be able to animate open/close dors and others....
the idea is to have it working exactly like in the game

Thanks for feedback on Modelbin Texture Collector guys. We will figure it out how it will work, we could add support for those who have required library (copy support) and those who not (listing).

Anyways, we have been researching and we finally managed to achieve following in Swatchbin Texture Converter.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bl3nRfizCUA

Many of people have been complaining about dx10 dds format. So we decided to add support for more accessible formats like PNG, BMP and TGA. 
We are in touch that it reduce quality of DXGI formats, but it will be user choice to decide which format to use. (maybe we put warning or something about possible quality loss)
I guess that those people who convert Forza cars to GTA, NFS converting those textures to accessible formats like PNG, BMP, TGA so our tool could do a favour.

It's sounds very good, except that you do it silently "in underground", because you can save hours of work for us...

Anyway, for skeleton you'll need to process CAR\scene\CAR_skeleton.gr2 files, most of tools for other games make it through using a granny2.dll directly for import.

Maybe here's another way exist - CAR\CAR.carbin seems to have information for linking of bones inside, but it's not explored atm.

CAR\scene\CAR_skeleton.modelbin looks pretty useless for any case, it's just a copy of skeleton available in every other modelbin for that car.

Btw, do you plan to share your tool?

There are many other tools that extract models with UV's and skeletons and correctly scaled, but are all private, I hope this will not be another one of them

Of course the idea is to share the tool, would be really selfish to take what the people is sharing here and make something for myself out of it
Andrakann I'm trying to download the tools to export the skeletons, but they are no longer available, maybe you can give me a working link? (PM)
I don't have much time to work on this tool, only on weekends, right now I'm focus on the basic outside car parts, as long as the parts names are the same on all models it will work perfectly, if the names are too diferent it will take way more time
I'll try to put a video of how it works so far this weekend

Thank you again!

I don't have much time to work on this tool, only on weekends, right now I'm focus on the basic outside car parts, as long as the parts names are the same on all models it will work perfectly, if the names are too diferent it will take way more time
I'll try to put a video of how it works so far this weekend

Thank you again!

Glad to hear the news, good luck!

fixed a bug with the material names in lower lods
(FH3, view link in my sig)

(thanks, as always, go to Andrakann and minime891)

You may have experienced that it's a little bit hard to get the different uv sets (1 to 5) via manual selection.
Since I'm too busy with real life concerns and other private projects I can't care for the texturing.
So I don't really know to which degree a proper texturing is possible so far.

(I'm using automatic detection via VLay(ering) with an unreleased version but I can't release it as long as it produces so many wrong uv maps.)

Some textured (LodS0 or Lod1) model parts (body_a.modelbin, for example) which show what is missing could be helpful.
(It would also be great if someone could make some kind of table which shows what parts of a model are usually using the different uv sets.)

It says compression wrong, are you sure you using the same zip compression as in game?
And what about using extracted folder instead of zip?

Using an extracted folder I was met with this:



Also I have no idea about zip compression settings. I've just been dragging the modified files into the existing zip. I'll have a poke around though.

Can you send over your modified files/zip?

I'm getting crazy... the name of the bones doesn't match with the name of the objects :/ for sample some objects are called FR Door when is supposed to be RR Door and so on...
is that an exporter problem or there is maybe a relationship list?

In Granny Viewer you can see that list, but without relations:
[](http://fastpic.ru/view/91/2017/0306/697637a10ca8404441baad48ff6bfaef.png.html)

Maybe carbin-file contain relations, unexplored atm.

gr2-skeleton have all connection information, but you'll need to use granny2.dll to load it correctly i think.
Carbin contain only some numbers for skeleton entries, and idk, how to connect them to skeleton inside modelbins:

This tool read .modelsbin and get textures that are called, if there is. Textures can be found in folder swatchbin from where the exe was launched.

Like this one

only if they're stored as an image format and not rendered real time whilst in game, out of interest why do you need it? Surely this cannot be only source where such images can be found

Added _library folder, thanks to GTAIV Modder for pointing this out to me  and added an icon to the program..
Download here:[https://github.com/Frazzlee/MakeH2O-Plugin](https://github.com/Frazzlee/MakeH2O-Plugin)
Next update will hopefully use MakeH2O to open the files and create the obj directly so minimising work needed to convert to obj : ) 
p.s. Will also take a look at dash scaling issue when I have time...


Edit 20:56pm : Added new source so I don't have to do it later

I think some images like the one that i uploaded should be local stored because it's a stock car, i don't need the tuned ones.
And the reason is because i wanted to make a design and use this resources, and it's pretty hard to find a set of consistent cars, with the same scale and angle.

fixed a bug with Aston Martin Vulcan (ast_vulcan_16), body_a.modelbin, reported by SonyKalien; thx!

Be aware of such lines in the obj files:
# body_a.modelbin, # uv-sizes 24 24 32 32 28 32 32 32 32 36 36 
which should help to decide which uv offsets to choose.

There's 11 uv blocks. The first one has the uv channels 2, 3, 4 at offsets 4, 8, 12,
the 6th one should have 2 3 4 5 (at offsets 4, 8, 12, 16),
the 8th and 10th should have all 5 sets (unchecked, so this has to be proven!)

could you make it so that your program can open the files as a default settings, so as to say dragging the modelbins.txt into the exe would work?

I was thinking about command line parameters, or using the exe in a batch, but found it less important.

Separate obj files to be created for Exterior, Interior and _library (CAD_ATSV_16) when parsing a 
scene-modelbins.txt for example would make more sense to me.

The more important things on the todo list are complete uv maps, the movable parts, the suspensions, the dashboards.

Just in case it's of any use to someone - I did a comparison of UV mapping as produced by MakeH20.

This is the SLOD parts from Lambo Cenentario. In game it has a carbon fibre material. This is produced by a tiled normal map across the body. The map is mirror-imaged down the center of the body (via flipped UVs not normals?), so the car parts are also split down the centre, except for lower LOD's. Also, after a quick hex thru the meshbins to get material and map names, it appears that lower LODs may use slightly different materials. In this case I suspect that the lower LODs have a separate material for left and right instead of mirrored UVs using the same material. I could be wrong about this, this is just an observation

yeah the command line params need to be changed, what language is it written in?

It's possible to use WM_DROPFILES, i.e. you could drag 'n drop the modelbins.txt into the extractor's window but since it has a one-shot-only structure that doesn't make too much sense.

A professional solution would be doing a recursive search for modelbin files and having them displayed as a list where to choose from with multiple selections.

But since my time is limited I decided to use dir /s /b *.modelbin > modelbins.txt which I found to be a very efficient way of collecting.

Things are going pretty well with the last JM, JM4 and 5 are O.K., i can do things like that: 

 or 

Each model can take for me 30 mn to 2 hours to have something correct using Blender. 

At the end models are pretty good looking :



but there are some cars that simply don't want to be converted, as for example the AMC Rebel "the machine", which make every H20 version crashing, and lead to an incomplete obj. 

Does anybody here havec some insight wether its coming from the original modelbin and its extraction or from the conversion by H2O and so can be done at the end. 

Thanks in advance!!

ahh c, and idk if you've seen my plugin (collects modelbin files from all dir and writes to respective modelbins.txt), but I wanted to do it where it uses exe to directly produce the obj's too
p.s. could you take name of folder in which modelbins.txt is in and have that as the obj name pls, i'm happy to help

p.s. could you take name of folder in which modelbins.txt is in and have that as the obj name pls, i'm happy to helpI really appreciate this but after 30 min of weighting the pros and cons I found that handling a command line parameter would lead to further confusions atm.

I need a better understanding of the uv layering (i.e. a more or less fully textured model).

Atm in jm versions I use the BOOL CheckUV_offsets(HWND hwnd) function
to handle uv-offsets manually (line uv-offsets 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 (example) in the obj files).

This uv selection has to be done for each xxx_a.modelbin separately (I'm not even sure if once you found a suiting offset combination it would fit for all modelbins of a model).

The idea of your plugin processing modelbins automatically is good but it severely interferes with the manual uv selection (per model, or maybe even worse, per modelbin?). It would produce dozens of obj files containing many wrong uv maps which I fear could cause a shit storm.

I don't have the time for texturing so still waiting for a fully textured model, see above.

Does anybody here havec some insight wether its coming from the original modelbin and its extraction or from the conversion by H2O and so can be done at the end. 

Thanks in advance!!

MakeH20-J5 gives me "more than one v block" error. No crash but mesh has "invalid vertex index" on import.

I will try to narrow down the offending part.

It is:

```
amc_rebel_70\scene\Exterior\Hood\hood_a.modelbin
```


With that line removed I get no problems with MakeH20 but the resulting .obj is still slow to import but eventually does.

Thanks, you are my savior !!

It works smoothly, and i have a nice obj without the regular hood (whatever the LOD) and without error in Blender, but, wich is strange, is that if i use MakeH20-J5 on the modelbin.text generated by the dir_modelbin in the exterior/hood folder alone, i got the nice regular hood i need. Seems the error is just when MakeH20-J5 (and the others) run on the full modelbin text. 

How did you find the line, by try and error or you read it in the matrix?

Seems the error is just when MakeH20-J5 (and the others) run on the full modelbin text.

That is strange, as dir_modelbin.cmd generates absolute paths, and these paths have no influence on the generated obj. The only difference would be that you only have all the hoods listed instead of every single car part. 

I did try hood_a alone and with the same results and errors.

> How did you find the line, by try and error or you read it in the matrix?

I prayed, and Jesus showed me the correct path.   

No really, if you watch the MakeH20 it will list each part after it has been processed. So if it pauses with an error message, the problem lies with the next file that is listed in modelbins.txt after the last part that is displayed.

How do you know what parts goes on what bone? the names doesn't match and is quite difficult to identify some parts

To Sonik, i will send you the files if you want, i used J5 and Blender for import (and for what is worth, on a 32 bits WIN 7). And now i have a full AMC rebel

To be honest, i don't use the skeleton, it's the only file i remove from the modelbin_text generated. I run the H2O, now the J5, and i import the obj in Blender. 
After, i separate first the lods in another layer, using the outliner. 
after that, still with the outliner now in the layer with all the lods, i put doors, hood, trunk, wipers, suspension, wheel, dash, etc, each part that need to be adjust or rescaled in its layer.

Next, i just have to rescale the dash, steering wheel and wipers, an dmove the trunk and hood. 
For the doors, there is always one which is good, and the other just need to be adjusted. 

Now there is always some bad surprise, as having to look for some part in the lod1 (rims, pars of the dash, some hoods, etc. ) or dash so distorted that i take half an hour to adjust. And these fu...g wipers.

thanks for that, i don't have the time to make a list of all the problem i encountered, but thanks to Sonik i tried to find the issue for some of them:

Henessey Venom : error message : more than one V block! the engine is the problem, like the AMC by converting the engine line alone, and the rest without it, it works. I'm disapointed to see there is no real engin inside. 

Camaro 2016 : error message :  more than one V block problem are the Seats and the line below, work without them, not a big deal as the others camaro of the game are good, so i guess we can find seats, calipers wheels and rotor here. 

Fiat Abarth 595 68 : problem is the body, this time always give message : a more than 15 submeshes - break. Without the body, no error message but the mesh is still a mess.

-jm7/8 improves AMC; engine_a uv maps better (but still assumed to be uncomplete):

Many thanks for the jm8, i don't know what you did  but before there was some obj generated that blender was unable to open. 

With your jm8, i can open them without problem (for what i remember that was the plymouth prowler, the ferrari f50, the vauxhall astra, the two ultima cars, etc.)

And fiat 595 is ok!

Thanks again!!!!

Only [this tool](https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/nb-stor/dos/ExportTool-v1.7.3.zip) can convert skeleton to DAE (it's also have text/xml structure and can be edited in text editor like OBJ).
And you need to put fresh granny2.dll to tool root folder to work.
Archive  with Granny Viewer + GR2-to-DAE + granny2.dll is uploaded [here](https://yadi.sk/d/8xUQE3_z3EoadD).

If you mean those like I do, they are inside certain car archive. (#.\media\cars\fer_laferarri_13.zip\Textures|UI\*.swatchbin).
These textures are mostly 'unique', meaning there are no other cars using the same texture (dials, display, gauges etc.), otherwise they are inside shared library Textures.zip (Ferrari logo for instance, multiple Ferrari's use the same texture or a carbon texture, used by multiple cars).
They can be recognized easily by not containing "cars\_library\Textures*" in modelbin.

There are no engine or light textures in Forza Horizon 3 like we are used from previous Forza versions. Each engine or light is textured with 'materials' (pre-made commonly used references, let's say) instead of standalone texture map (similiar to Forza 4 Autovista). 
'Materials' use simple, commonly used textures like normalized plastic, aluminum, leather, carbon, manufacturer logos... or just simple diffuse color (regular plastic).
Instead of single swatchbin map, the modelbin entry may refer to materialbin, which can be considered as commonly used swatchbin container (with shader settings).
Some people may be confused seeing light or engine maps inside AO folder in each car archive. These maps represent ambient occlusion maps, whose are basically 'fake shadows' and some of the UV channels using it somehow, even if they are not listed in materialbin...

Short-answer: There are no light_lod0 or engine_SLOD maps at all.

Ah thanks for the explanation, so all the available Textures needed for a car are in the textures folder?

I found here secondary lights textures, which are textures for bulbs. Can somebody upload primary lights textures?
I have forza but its encrypted  no idea how to get files from it.

I was wondering whats wrong with skeleton, names arent the same as the ones in model, many bones are simply missing for placement of some car parts.

BTW its possible to make materials for models. It's ok that 3d models are separated by materials but all are assigned to default material.

Thanks,
A question: Doesn't it break the game after that? I mean it's pain download in my slow net all the game, so I hope it doesn't touch any original files just copy them and encrypt them somewhere else isnt it?

I have forza but its encrypted  no idea how to get files from it.

I was wondering whats wrong with skeleton, names arent the same as the ones in model, many bones are simply missing for placement of some car parts.

BTW its possible to make materials for models. It's ok that 3d models are separated by materials but all are assigned to default material.

Where are they? (and to dump game you gotta use UWP to decrpyt game files - https://github.com/Wunkolo/UWPDumper)

basic instructions - https://pastebin.com/raw/6JqqrXce

yeah I know for a fact it breaks the game, though to re download I wouldn't reccomend the Windows Store, I'd reccomend download it using IDM or something similar, it decrypts the files and dumps the in a folder next to the FH3 game directory

Google "OpusDev torrent" and download only files you need.

[viewtopic.php?f=16&t=4256&p=126817&hili ... ty#p126817](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=4256&p=126817&hilit=+pretty#p126817)

and you'll find out that a scanning of material.bins is required and some more. This will not become part of the Make_H2O-ForzaHor3 project because of lack of time/motivation.

It should be a separate project, the required coding skills are supposed to be simple but it's a tedious task.

I'm not sure if anyone took care for the positions of movable parts seriously; 
the problem I see is that the bone's tail position (boneDoorRF here) and the doorHandleRF location don't fit exactly when placing manually.
(other than the mesh the bones aren't un-mirrored so far, so LF and RF are swapped)

When using the values from the dae, it's totally shxt (lower part of pic).

Ued the values from the dae, adding the x,y,z components from root and child boneDorrLF (doorHandleLF):

I noticed that some parts also has wrong scale and rotation.

Eg. Ford Focus RS '03 (trunk/boot badges)so tiny and rotate bad without bone, also disc and calipers bone arent good.

BTW. anybody knows where FH3 stores now body paint colors and carPartsposition (apart from bones), in older forzas it was all in gamedb.slt

well, stupid me forgot to swap y and z for blender, how poor  
It's 0.811206, -0.740454, 0.601394 for the doorHandleLF, works like a charm, then, door position ok.

(rmh, seems noone is really interested in automatic positioning any more,
well I leave you alone with this, since I gave the idea how to perform it by python script.)

Keep in mind to parent the other child "doorHandleLF" parts such as LS0_doorHandleLF_a_LODS0_metal_RGH_001
to parent "LS0_doorHandleLF_a_LODS0|doorLF_a_LODS0_carPaint"
so that they move all together.

(Didn't test it, should work, don't have a better idea.)

Hey, I would like to share our progress with Modelbin Textures Collector - update 2.

Since this update (02-04-2017) the tool is able to read files in original archives, there is no need to extract anything. The tool directly, silently and quickly decompress archive chunk and finds required data of entries, matches file and copies it to specified directory.

Structure:

```
modelbin → swatchbin > materials\swatchbin

```


The only required thing is having car archive and required library (Materials.zip, Textures.zip and their 'pri' variants). 
* Repacked variants of archives will work too, if they do not lack of required files.

Rather than writing another hundreds of words, here's quick video:
https://youtu.be/bVcAz9gu1Kw

With the latest version of shakotay2's Make_H2O-ForzaHor3-jm8 and MTC it's possible to quickly match materials and properly texture model surface.
Our goal is to generate .mtl files for each material (materialbin entry) so maybe there will be a way to match objects containing material name with mtl materials (if not, then probably force with maxscript).

* UV-scale done manually

And you don't have a problem ([mentioned here](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?p=127399#p127399)) with RF door parts position in Blender?..

Does this mean we don't have to separate by materials or find Textures

And you don't have a problem (mentioned here) with RF door parts position in Blender?..well, from a sideview it looks ok; apart from that frayed edge (caused by the parenting, I guess?).
But yes, for RF the x position is wrong for some weird reason:

The hood values are not EXACT:
import bpy

bpy.data.objects["LS0_hood_a_LODS0_carPaint"].location = (-0.001401,-0.860749,0.800358)
(compare to manual chosen transform values in the pic)

from the dae it's:
0,000000 1.707395 1.263087
-0.001401 -0.907037 -0.402338
adding:

(rmh, seems noone is really interested in automatic positioning any more,
well I leave you alone with this, since I gave the idea how to perform it by python script.)

Second, i totally agree. Honestly, it takes me 15/20 mn for each model to move the parts at the right place, and i take my time. I just hard time for the wipers, and there is sometimes some parts missing in the dashboard (for example impossible to find a part in the dashboard of the camaro zl1 2017, the back or bottom of the thing blowing the air, and the speakers). 

But not a big deal. 

What would be great is to have the UV maps and the textures associated, at least for the superb engines that we find in these cars! I can do it by scratch but that would be really better.

(Guess, the problem will be solved more or less as soon as zwrtron's MTC will generate mtl files.)

Infinity Q60 dash made into obj makes it a pain to scale and join or make any sense of, as oppose to other dashboards which are relatively easy ...

I didn't use the cytium, since I don't have the gr2 skeleton file for it, but the one from the AST DB11_17.
The results should be similar, though.

From the picture you can see the problems. I used the locating script as before:
import bpy
bpy.data.objects["L01_steeringWheel_a_LOD12_Interior_LOD1|steeringWheel_a"].location = (0.383590,0.015409,0.689967)



DB11-dash.JPG (116.09 KiB) Viewed 285 times


but the wheel position had to be adjusted manually afterwards.

Maybe the original dashStructure position is wrong, too?
(But even if we corrected its y position, it wouldn't compensate the offset to the wheel; looks like it would move away from it then.)

will the tool be able to include normals with obj files?  i read through the thread but didnt really find whether its on the table to be addressed or not.

It's quite simple to fix in 3ds or Zmod, shouldn't think it needs looking into that much

i was just wondering because it seems the tool is quite powerful already, exporting meshes and even mapping - original normals would be a nice addition towards exporting complete models

I check the decompression of the 32 bit normals (11-11-10?) from time to time; were displayed as vertex-per-face-normals in blender but sum-of-squares of the components is not 1.0; texturing is not my main subject, too.

Yes, i mean whilst it would be great to have this, it's a few minutes to fix, so i think UV's or materials or scaling/positioning take priority

Hi Again guys, someone could give me a hand on the tires and rims?

I can imagine I need to scale them up, but I have no idea of how much, or if there is any standard scale for them
I saw that they are over stretched on X axis (or Y or Z depending on the software) but doesn't look like is scaled up, look more like you have to move some of the vertex down
Also on the tires they are all really fuck up, the thickness of all of them is always the same, so I presume they have some kind of morphing system that I'll try to replicate

At the end what I would love to know is what scale ratio did you use for the rims on other cars, or if someone knows where I can find the dimensions of the standard tires for this kind of cars
Again Thank you!!!

Take a fender and platform from appropriate car and scale to match that

Thank you Frazzlee, that would work if I don't care about precision and I had the tires with the rims, also that doesn't give me any reference for the tire width

What do you need it for, surely you can use in reference to something, because here we have no scale to put everything against

Sizes for default wheels is available in FH3\Media\DB\gamedb.slt - Data_Car table, columns: FrontTireWidthMM, FrontTireAspect, FrontWheelDiameterIN, RearTireWidthMM, RearTireAspect, RearWheelDiameterIN.

You can open gamedb.slt with [DB Browser for SQLite](http://sqlitebrowser.org/).

There is a problem with the UVs, the coordinates are correct, but they are adapted to cover the full UV frame, you can clearly see that on the small strikers, all of them cover the full frame, there is any hope of fixing this in the future?

That and the wrong scale on some objects are the only real problems so far...

It's not really a issue. I find it's not hard to scale and do all the skeleton door placements. Sure, it would help if it came out all perfect; what members here have provided is much appreciated and it is usable. Most models have weld issues too but easy to correct.

For right side doors that do not work with skeleton. I suggest mirror the left door components and use view points (Top, Left) to level the right side door parts to it.

I already said that they're in the stripped folder. And then in RC13HiRes.zip or rc14hires.zip and maybe some others i have not looked.

You said you already had the Dev build so if you need more help just ask.

Yes, sorry. I didn't know what the 'stripped' folder was, so i asked for the location of the files and didn't got a response. But now i found something with that name files. I'm donwloading part of the torrent again, thanks.

Edit: So, i unpacked every zip (Except RC14hires.zip because it wasn't there) and i only found .swatchbin files. Should i do something to convert them? Am i looking into the wrong folder?

@brianmoyano - Thumbnails are inside 
```
media\ui\textures\Thumbnails.zip
```


& you can convert them to dds using Swatchbin Converter and then to your favorite format quickly, using Photoshop actions and Automate Batch process. However, latest (not released) version of Swatchbin Converter 0.40 supports convertsion to PNG and BMP, but unfortunatelly, there is problem with BC5 compression on which the tool fails for no reason.

While using DirectXTex-master suite framework by Microsoft and their decompiler, it throws following error for BC5_UNORM only, even if forcing compression. Other compression are just fine.
The input is valid.

```
writing BC5_UNORM.BMP FAILED (80070032)
```

For myself with blender i use the gauges, the center console and other parts of the car as placeholders. Same for the size. 
Lod1 dashboard cas also be used to have the right place and size, especially for the steering wheel. 

One thing that can help is to use mesh from older forza extracted models, horizon or FM3.

is there a way to stretch the meshes out to selected points on the right scaled meshes?

Could be but i think it's faster to make it by trial and error, i take the mesh, scale it with "S", place it roughly on the right place and with combinaisons of "G" and "S" in the 3 axles separately i adjust until i'm satisfied. For an old dashboard it takes 2/3 minutes but for modern ones that can exceed 10 minutes, price for the design i guess.

btw: would be interesting to compare an extracted and textured model of the Scout to this video:

3DSimED seems to work now on the modelbin. Scaling and uv seems mostly O.K. But its only 20 days trial so be fast to use it 

Don't know if there is a batch script for that, but i had to import each modelbin one by one. Don't forget to use the export plug-in to export. The fbx generated is one single mesh, easy to split with blender but seems to give problem to friends of mine using 3Dmax. 

Look like there are issues of normal on some meshes too. 

For blender user, import all the fbx (fbx binary is mandatory), scale x100 and rotate 180° and you have the exact same thing that H2O generated obj.

I prefer the MakeH2O way, so i will use this one for the dashboard, wipers, doors and where uv are usefull.

yep, like i said work on MODELBIN for horizon 3 cars, works on carbin only for APEX cars. You have to convert each part modelbin. 

I tried with success with parts from F100 trophy truck, cadiallac sedan 2016, holden sandman....

You can export directly in 3ds.

For anyone wanting to import to Zmod3, export as rFactor2 and import with Zmod

Just export to kn5 and then import to 3ds max. Seems to work fine for the part i tested, all separated and mapping okay.

How to import LOD1 models with 3DsimED anybody knows?
Is just LOD0 models are to high for the game I mod (World Racing 2), so I always use LOD1 + some LOD0 parts.

I suggest to go to the 3DsimED forum to ask as i'm not sure this is the correct place. [http://thepits.us/board/viewforum.php?f=25](http://thepits.us/board/viewforum.php?f=25)

I shall still be using shakotay2s' tool as it has the other UV channels And as you point out other LODs.

There seems to be a lot of isolated vertices with 3DsimED, at least with the method i have chosen to get it into 3dsmax.

Forza Horizon 3. I have the resources extracted for a car from OpusDev(Ferrari F50). Rear wheels are different from front wheels and I successfully placed everything in place. I was looking for textures, but there's no texture for wheels. I've looked in every single texture folder (and checked every single texture present). Is there something I'm missing?
Thanks guys

They don't have textures like before but in stead just use an AO texture and material settings. At least that's how it seems to me, maybe some one will correct me.

Thanks mate, from where did you pull that texture, I wasn't able for the life of me to find it.

I have a simple question about lower LODs. Where are those located? I've tried to import a car package from GameModels in 3DSimED but seems those are not imported. Now, I don't know if the package is missing the lower LODs needed, or if the tool is not able to import them yet.

Sorry again but there's something strange in the UV map... it seems there should be another texture from this map

Nothing strange, the UV you are showing are in the UV channel 1 for the front wheel and you try to use it with the picture for the rear wheel. 


FBX generated by 3Dsimed are multichannel for UV, if you try the UV channel 3, for the front wheel image, it will be all right.

But I didn't use 3dsimed. Just the extraction tool from Shakotay2 and imported the obj into max
If I look into the id menu of the UV editor in max there's just a single id (number 1). Can't find other channels

Ah, that's the point. MakeH2O generate .obj files that don't support multi UV channel. I guess you have to play with the 44444444, 88888,  12121212, 161616 thing in the tool, or to use 3Dsimed to have .dae or .fbx.

High detail models don't use these textures (probably only low poly one's)
Btw if someone will correct me and say they do use them, I wonder how do they help because they're just shading textures and are useless. high detail meshes are good enough to generate shading with game engine.
[](https://ibb.co/f3GgrQ)
Instead there are few good textures for gaudges, decals and stitches that HQ models use, everything else is just simple diffuse color because there's a material for every part

@chasez i suggest you go read about ambient occlusion maps. The high lods use them including the interior. Game shading sucks imo, AO maps make a big difference.

Still stuck on how to find a way to texture rear wheels meshes of the damn ferrari.
AO don't match UVs that I have in max, can't find a way to pull other textures for wheels... would need a tutorial on wheels for Horizon 3...

 No. Only low poly models use ao mapping because it's generated from high poly model. I know, because I used to paint vertices on my GTA4 mods to make the car look better and believe it or not original cars had painted vertices aswell (you can actually see that when you flip the car over the bottom is darker). If you don't know what I mean just watch any video on youtube about painting vertices. You are welcome!

Well the fact is you're wrong. The AO textures cover body, front/rear seats, interior door panels, headlights, engine bay etc. All high poly parts that use the AO texture which is confirmed when you look at the UV layers.

And i fully understand what vertices painting is so i don't need to watch a video. TDU1/2 users painted vertices along with i suppose many other games. I suggest again that you go read about ambient occlusion or just look at the forza models to further understand what parts use AO textures.

Ok managed my way thru 3dsimed. It is unable to load the full carbin of the car, but it can load part by part from scene folder. I found the wheel mesh and I saved as FBX. Now in max I have the various UVW channels with correct names of materials. I found one .materialbin in the opusdev release but I can't for the life of me track back the related swatchbin... also the AO texture you posted isn't compliant with any channel of the UVW. I understand that the mesh should be painted via a generic swatchbin texture and then "shaded" via the AO map, but I just can't find a way to have a mesh and a UV related to a single texture.
I've seen that "Materialbin Texture Collector" should be the right tool to have what I need but it hasn't been released so I'm here stuck on a loop...
Any help?

Can't help you because i'm not a 3DMax user. In Blender, its fairly easy, there are 4 UV map for the Ferrari wheel, and one of them fit the AO map. Blender its a freeware, i don't see why a pro software like Max shoudn't be able to do the same. 

But to be honest, i don't find them not very useful. It's just a trick to fake shadows for game engines, whatever the lod, and i want these models for render only. The only useful ones are the doortages, the gauges, and some liveries.

Anyway, just some examples :

right bottom you have the UVMap on the AO Map and you can see in the pannel on the right that UV channel is 3.

i just used a simple node configuration, a mix 50/50 of a glossy shader and the texture.



same thing with a glossy shader more glossy but part only for 20% for the result. 



last one without the AO Map.

Ok, thanks a lot.
That's for the front wheel, but the situation of the rear wheel UV map (at least for me and my skills) is different. In channel 2 I have the aluminum clearcoat but map don't fit the AO:

you must "take ownership" of folder, and game's gotta be dumped with UWD, or just download the dev version which is un encrypted

Hey there. I would like to announce release of Swatchbin Texture Converter 0.40.

Key features:
 • Added support to convert input files to PNG and BMP formats with possibility of sRGB color correction.
 • Added feature to overwrite existing output files. The converter will skip existing file if already exists in destination folder. Enabled by default.
 • Added feature which informs the user of unsuccessful conversion together with three new ways to recognize invalid inputs. (InvalidSwatchbinHeaderException, UnsupportedCompressionException and the one for handling empty files with swatchbin extension) 
 • Added logging feature of unsuccessful conversions to text file. Folder: %appdata%\SwatchbinConverter\logs.
 • Added support for R8G8B8A8 compression.
 • Fix: It is no more possible to change preferences while the conversion is running.
 • Fix: One-per-launch warning dialog for "Delete once done" feature.
 • Fix: The tool will not process file if invalid/unsupported compression byte is found (line in previous versions) but throws error instead

DOWNLOAD HERE

Please report any issues immediately by using private message here, or use contact methods at download website.

Enjoy.

You also need a Forza Horizon 3\media\_library\ folder extracted, and content of Textures_pri_44 must be moved to Textures folder, then content of Textures_pri_45 moved to Textures folder with confirmation of overwriting existing files, because "pri_44" contains broken textures, and "pri_45" have their fixed versions.
Same for Materials_pri_44 and 45 in both media\_library and media\cars\_library folders.

Hey there   
I would like to announce progress with Modelbin Texture Collector in 4 points.

MODELBIN TEXTURE COLLECTOR:
Modelbin Texture Collector is tool, which scans modelbins of Forza Horizon 3 car archive and collects all textures required to properly texture whole car. 
In average, there are ~200 textrures per each car. 
If you are interested, make sure you watch all videos related to Modelbin Collector ->[Tado Hmn Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCx1Fn_wZHdxjIMOIgneq-Xg)

1.) LIBRARY ARCHIVES
In current state, the collector will need only four archives of _library folder to work propertly (around ~1GB) and the one of car being processed.
The archives containing textures COULD NOT be original archives, modified/repacked archives with correct names will work. If you do not own the game, you can download the library from somewhere.
NOTE: If you own the game, you CAN use original archives in "media/cars/_library/", there is no need to extract anything. The Collector reads only, also no backup needed.

2.) CAR ARCHIVES
The same about car archives. They CAN be original or repacked (downloaded from somewhere), also there is no need to extract anything.
During the process of collection, the collector scans car archive for modelbins, materialbins and swatchbins and CHANGES pointers for texture references. See reference down below.

3.) CONSOLE APPLICATION
A friendly "GUI". See video.

4.) ALL DURING A FEW SECONDS.

EXAMPLE (redirecting pointers):
Let's say we processing archive: D:\MyModels\downloaded_bmw_m2_16.zip and our library is located D:\MyModels\library\
If the entry refers original swatchbin in car archive : Game:\Media\cars\bmw_m2_16\textures...\gauge.swatchbin
The tool finds it in CAR ARCHIVE' and changes to (for example):
D:\MyModels\downloaded_bmw_m2_16.zip\2016 BMW M2\textures\gauge.swatchbin
If the entry refers to library: Game:\Media\cars\_library\textures...\badge.swatchbin
The tool finds it in "Textures.zip" OR "Textures_pri_45.zip" and changes to:
D:\MyModels\library\textures.zip\badge.swatchbin

Hard to explain, even harder to code.   

See latest video on Youtube!

Why bother if there is 3DSimEd ?

Hey, thank you for reply. Not sure if it's just me or your reply sounds frustrating, but the version of 3.1i of 3DSimEd I've tried collected the textures shown on the screenshot above. Next Version, do you mean upcoming? Perhaps next version of this paid software will do the same, no doubt. Maybe in next version there will be no need to make fake directories for library, who knows.

The sentense "Why bother if there is 3DSimEd ?" was supposed to say "look what is different" instead of "look my tool can do it better" as it may sound like   

I am posting an progress in here to get ideas for the development, how to do it better, how can I improve the collector to be better. For example like idea of hashless filenames you have suggested for Swatchbin Converter.

Exactly! 

Sorry for "your reply sounds frustrating", but your development cycle is tends to be overpolished (second time!) without any release, so it's need to push a little for birth something 

Congratulations with release

Yes you are right, thats because we always make sure that the tool will not fail or produce logical errors, have optimized algorithms with lowest possible O notation difficulty and does not perform any unnecessary operations. This results to fact, that collection of single archive using collector went from 9-15 seconds to 2-8 seconds (on my machine) and thats even without using parallelism.   
{ there is a parallel (mutli thread, stream allocated) version of Swatchbin converter in development, which does a 2 minute task of (latest) 0.41 version in ~28 seconds, but shhhh }
As I mentioned earlier, both me and Tado had exams term so we had no free time to spend on development, but as was promised, after the exams term, we started to work on it and the result is out.

Modelbin Texture Collector 1.0.3 Update
For those who have previous (console version), please redownload to this fixed GUI version. Link in my signature.

• Tado wrote our very own from-scratch adapter for accessing non-default filesystems (like ZIP archives are), with our own, very fast, filesystem provider and accessor. In short, that means that a truezip library which has enormous 4.7 MB is no needed anymore and the tool itself has only 300KB!

• Brand new approach of collecting files from archive. 
Instead of read -> write method there is new method based on path streaming, only possible because of our file system provider and it's very fast lookup feature !

• Collecting single archive is now more than 2 times faster! (depends on HDD speed, the collector wait until files are written and stream closed).

• Fixed issue with skipping built-in materialbins and swatchbins because of lowercase or uppercase letters. (non default filesystems are case sensitive, but those we have are not)

• Fixed issue with "&" symbol in material names instead of "%". (FER_500TR_54)

An old man has an interrogation ....

What am I doing wrong???

I create a folder with Textures.zip, Materials.zip etc ... and an encrypted Car_for_test.zip.

I work with console version. I get the message the way to Textures.zip etc. is valid.

I type COLLECT Car_for_test zip. After this action I get only a blank XML file, no collection with swatch.bin

Must decrypt the files? Have I read something not properly understood?

My old brain is now smoking ....

Make sure you used these inside cars media\cars\_library NOT the ones in media/_library ! Private message me if you have any questions.

If you are using console version, please switch to latest (GUI) version as it has some bugs fixed.
You have message that directory is valid, because the collector check archive existence, no its content.

Please, see this kind-of-outdated video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPM74dAOl80](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPM74dAOl80)

@zwrtron
Thank you for your offer, I will come back to it.

New question...

I can not find a complete axle suspension in the many parts for the cars. Only in the folder undercarriage are stub axles, but no springs and shock absurd .... strange! Or do I need a new pair of glasses?

3DsimED has small problems with the tire size, but this is not bad. The correct tire size and rim size I can calculate myself.

The game is well designed in many areas. Only the tuning parts for old cars disturb me. Wider tires or other exhaust is okay, but these wings ..... no no ...  

I like classic cars in original condition ...

my absolute favourites   

Opel Kadett
Opel GT
Volvo 1800
Volvo 123
Mercedes 280 SL
Holden Sandman

Hey there !
We have been really bored last days so we devised to bring something more enjoyable than just plain input-output tools. As Swatchbin Converter is being our absolute favourite we decited to bring it to another level. We are aware that is COMPLETELY UNNECESSARY, but what could be a better way to spend free time rather than in front of code.  

The main vision is to develop Swatchbin Converter to something like an original Forza Texture Extractor by Ernegien, which has been implemented in Forza Studio later on.

As we found out, reading is not favourite action of users of our tools   , so rather than explaining by thousand of word what we have done so far, see video down below:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eGsFxl1fok4
(sure, these sexy buttons will be replaced in future)

Any kind of ideas, feedbacks or requirements are very appreciated ! 

PS: You can use some new features on our homepage, if you are not Facebook-friendly.

My feedback ...  

After some start problems ...

The modelbin texture collector and swatchbin converter works very well for me. The DDS-converter can read and change everything.

very good work....

Swatchbin Texture Modding Assistant features yet:
 • Generate template for editing
 • Replace swatchbin
 • Create backup
 • Restore from backup
 • Tons of handling conditions

 I appreciate you trying. They don't seem to be up to date,with all due respect. There are still several Forza Horizon 3 cars that are missing and the site seems to update very slowly.
I am greatful they update at all. Anyways I appreciate you trying all the same. Enjoy Paris.

Modelbin Collector 1.0.4 - FM7 Support BETA

Hello there!
After release of FM7 we have been working on Modelbin Collector update since the old one will not work in most cases.

1.0.4 FEATURES
 • Added partial support for Forza Motorsport 7 UNENCRYPTED/DUMPED car archives. (see guide below)
 • Reworked library lookup mechanism
 • Library Manager - allows you to manage your library archives.



Quick guide for FH3:
Well, nothing actually changed when it comes to library setup.
1.) Open MTC
2.) File -> Library Setup...
3.) Add archives from (...\media\cars\_library) [except _pri_44]
4.) Close dialog
5.) Collect FH3/FM6 archives

Quick guide for FM7:
1.) Download unencrypted and repacked Forza 7 Library if you don't have your own. (Links -> Download -> Forza 7 Library Collection)
2.) Extract
3.) Add archives from downloaded library to Library Manager (File -> Library Setup...)
4.) Unpack FM7 car archive using quickBMS
5.) Pack back again to ZIP
6.) Collect FM7 Archives

WARNING Do not load both libraries at once (FH3/FM7), it may heavily slow down collection process.

BTW, does anyone found a way to access original ZIP archives? All we got is this:

```
invalid CEN header (unsupported compression method: 21)
```

Guys, welcome! Tell me, please, and the interior textures in the car all stand exactly? I took the Bentley Bantyaga model for conversion to GtaV, opened it in 3dsimed, and there are not half the textures of the interior, i.e. The texture of the cabin I found it is 512x512 but its coordinates on the model are flown and do not appear correctly. For example, the wood matrix in the model and the steering wheel also without a badge and buttons ... Help, please, how to eliminate this flaw?


Thank you!!!

@Pupsik - The texture you have talking about is used for lower LODs than you are trying. 
Here is list of texture maps used by "seat" of Bentley Bentayga for the LOD0/SLOD model you are using:

Well, the script actually tells nothing to me (being Java programmer) as some features may be implemented inside quickBMS application.

For me, not a programmer, it's contain a [link to zip specification](https://pkware.cachefly.net/webdocs/casestudies/APPNOTE.TXT).
And output log shows some offsets at extract stage which can be examined for better understanding.

Original Forza Studio 4 can read those zips directly (IIRC), so you can find some code in [released sources](http://codeescape.com/2012/05/forza-studio-4-0-forza-motorsport-resource-extraction-tool/) too.

Another strange thing is Name entry - this entry must have name lenght in symbols for correct reading, and it have it, but in strange format, like mirrored byte:

...or in some hex format I'm not familiar with:

18 is 12h and 31 is 1Fh - I can see some logic here, but it's strange.

...

An error here: "emaN`" is "Name 60h" where 60h is 6 symbols in name "Shadow".

This is (obviously) way late - but the short immediately preceding the string refers to the length of the String + that short, and the preceding 6 bytes. 

So...it's something like this:

```
short unk1;
short unk2; //unk1 & unk2 may really be a a single int - much like the unknown int in both the preceding header, and entry structures. 
short unk3; //len's length starts including from here.
short unk4;
short unk5;
ushort len; //(sizeof(short)*4)+length of string
char string[len-8];

```


or...
65 6D 61 4E E0 00 10 00 78 6F 42 42 80 01 16 00 62 75 6D 70 65 72 46 5F 61 5F 4C 4F 44 31

Where...
emaN

bumperF_a_LOD1 (14 bytes)

22 (8 bytes longer than string)

Part that's included in size

Now, one or more of those shorts likely indicate the type of name entry. Because there are at least two types. 

The first has 4 [s]null bytes[/s] an unsigned int after the string, and is recognizable by unk3 having the value of 8224 (20 20) and unk4 having the ASCII value of dI (64 49)

The second has 6 floats after the string, and is recognizable by unk3 & unk4 having the ASCII value of xoBB (78 64 42 42)

Edit:

I'm continuing to use bumperF_a.modelbin from the Crown Victoria Police Interceptor (Forza 7). 

I'm fairly confident that the entries look more like so:

```
char tag[4]; //emaN
ushort hshort1;
ushort hshort2; 
//end of "header"
char type[4]; "  dI" or "xoBB" (or even, MatI's "TSTA")
short unkShort;
short dataLength;
char text[dataLength-8];
//if type== "  dI"
uint unkInt;
//if type=="xoBB"
float unkFloats[6];
//if type=="TSTA"
//nothing

```


Now,  here's the fun part - after the full Name entries, there's a collection of "headerless" entries that omit the tag, and the first two shorts (i.e. first 8 bytes). With the exception of one, none of these have any actual text data - their "dataLength" fields are all set at 8 - or a zero length char array. The last of these name stubs, contains the seemingly nonsensical text of "feRTÀ " (66 65 52 54 C0 03 20 00) 

To make things more annoying, after the collection of the "headerless" entries, the section is finalized with an int, followed by a collection of ushorts. In the case of this particular file, there are 28 "complete" Name entries, the aforementioned int, has a value of half of that, and there are 28 shorts. I'm guessing these are just offsets to something. 

If the entire section needs to be read, including that short array, it's going to be obnoxious - especially considering that all sections make liberal use of padding. On the other hand, if it doesn't, then what's the point of it?

Is there anyone specifically working on the ability to extract textures for the existing FM7 models (both car and track) and edit things like tirewalls (add/edit branding), make tobacco liveries (example, the MP4/4) or fix some of the inaccurate adverts around tracks?

Are there any discord or other groups where people might be working to achieve this?  I'd like to contribute wherever possible.

I'm already tormented all evening)) I bought and installed forza 7. Can you please tell me how to copy Fz7 files from "windows apps" folder? I opened the folder, I can see the files. I can not copy files - they are encrypted and there is no access.
It turned out only to delete the archive of the car from there to a separate folder, but when unpacking it does not have access, in general it does not open it at least kill ((((rummaged everything, the owner of the folder changed nothing.) Help, please.

Hello,
Forza Studio v4.1, v4.4t2 and v4.6 were fully working for me until today.
Obviously for having those working i've installed the requiered frameworks in the past.
Since those stopped working (crash at start) I've reinstalled the frameworks, but nothing changed.
Any clues?

@zwrtron Will you be updating the Swatchbin Texture Modding Assistant to support Forza 7 zip? Or is it just me that can't import them?
I would love to edit some textures.

@minime891
The STMA unfortunately supports only regular ZIP files as standard filesystem (the one your OS can extract too without WinRAR) not the PKG archive they using. It will work if you unpack archive using Forza Studio or quickBMS and pack again using WinRAR for example.

Honestly there are no plans for me in future in updating it because using the system above is pointless as you cannot actually modify the game.

So, I have an interesting question with all this. Is there any way to take one of the liveries downloaded from the design shop in FH3 and apply that to a dumped model? I already have models that I can easily import, but I'd like a livery, and preferribly not having to manually repaint the livery in Photoshop. I would assume the livery downloaded from the game is saved.. Somewhere on the system, yes?

excuse me if this has already been discussed but how does one extract files from xbox 360 forza dlc packages
i've tried a handful of generic 360 package extraction tools but they all give the same incomplete results that all look basically like this:
Media/DLCZips/00[two random numbers]_pri_65/Media/audio/Cars/Engines/Soundbanks/LOD1/[and then a bunch of random .fsb files here]
and absolutely nothing else

one certain website has usually had all of the individual motorsport 4 dlc car archives i've wanted but there are certain car archives from motorsport 3 that just aren't available, so i'd like to just extract the files on my own, but i obviously can't.

So I've been trying all day to unpack the archives for Forza Horizon 4 but to no avail! I've tried changing permissions, I've tried injecting but the game crashes, I've tried quickbms and I have tried ForzaStudio but nothing has worked.

Now we all know models can be extracted as there's quite a few on Facebook and gamemodels but I want to be able to taker whatever car I want and do what I need to do without messing about downloading the models manually as I like to import the models into blender and do shit with it and right now all I want is the home space when you go into forzavista!

So yes, I really need your help!!

Thanks

The dumped/decrypted files consists of all the cars, wheels, tracks and some other little bits but the dumper failed before it could dump the rest of the track files!

The developer of UWPDumper is aware of Horizon 4 not being possible to dump, the dumper might eventually get updated to work with the game.

Thanks @verde57, just purchased it. Anyone have a link to a basic tutorial? The 'ol standby of drag-n-drop isn't working for me.

So far I have not found any files from FH4. I was able to rip the demo version of FH 4 successfully with UWPDumper. The files can also be unpacked without problems with quickbms. The files of the demo version can be opened with 3DSim. In the full version of FH 4, the dumper fails. We must wait patiently for an update of UWPDumper.

While not having updated the regular version in months the dev has recently essentially officially endorsed a very unofficial way of dumping the full version of the game.

Have their been any updates regarding wheel placement/positioning in the recent months? I’ve followed this thread for a while but been focusing on other things recently. Finally joined today

I know this is old message, but...

Well, I got a little problem while extract tracks from Forza Motorsport 7 game... I'm using Forza Studio to extract the whole data inside bin.zip track file...

It contains many Swatchbin files, and while I open it by using Swatchbin Texture Converter tool provided by Tado... I can't either view it or extract it ( it can't converted to PNG or BMP. It can converted to DDS but it won't open )... Can you help me with this please ? I really want to get texture datas from Prague and Rio de Janeiro tracks...

If this is works, I will look into Australia data in Forza Horizon 3 and Edinburgh data in Forza Horizon 4... But, the track minizip file can't extracted by using QuickBMS forza_minizip.bms  Maybe someone can help me please ?

Thanks in advance
~ Cheers

Unfortunately, I couldn't open their zip files in Forza Horizon 4 folder. They were locked by the small lock icon in the upper right corner, indicating that permissions were needed. I tried to change permissions, but it was useless to change permissions anyway.Anyone can help me, thank you.

Is there a way to get FH4 models without spending a fortune? I don't want to rip all my money on 3DSIMED... Free trials don't really help. Is there any other program that can get FH4 models for free?

Can anyone upload a link to the forza motorsport 7 engine audio folder with all the ".bank" files in it? It should be about 1.15 GB in size. Please pm me or link it here if you are willing to upload it on sharemods.com or other site.

I'm not sure if anyone took care for the positions of movable parts seriously; 
the problem I see is that the bone's tail position (boneDoorRF here) and the doorHandleRF location don't fit exactly when placing manually.
(other than the mesh the bones aren't un-mirrored so far, so LF and RF are swapped)
Doorposition.JPG
When using the values from the dae, it's totally shxt (lower part of pic).

Ued the values from the dae, adding the x,y,z components from root and child boneDorrLF (doorHandleLF):
Code: Select all          <node id="Bone_root_boneDoorLF" name="root_boneDoorLF" sid="root_boneDoorLF" type="JOINT">
            <matrix sid="Transform">0.999994 0.000000 -0.003383 X:-0.922483 0.000000 1.000000 0.000000 Y:1.707396 0.003383 0.000000 0.999994 Z:0.827334 0.000000 0.000000 0.000000 1.000000</matrix>
            <node id="Bone_boneDoorLF" name="boneDoorLF" sid="boneDoorLF" type="JOINT">
              <matrix sid="Transform">0.999994 0.000000 0.003383 X:0.111272 0.000000 1.000000 0.000000 Y:-1.106002 -0.003383 0.000000 0.999994 Z:-0.086873 0.000000 0.000000 0.000000 1.000000</matrix>
            </node>
          </node>(maybe I made some mirroring mistake?)

Don't think this will work due to the cars unfortunately being sized wrong.

Did you try to move LS0_hood_a_LODS0_hoodBadge_a_LODS0 (of Exocet), for example?
(You'll need to use ConverterApp.exe to create a .dae file to get the positions for moving parts, iirc.)

btw: would make more sense to continue in the concerning Forza Horizon 5 thread?

Hello, I was wondering, has there ever been any research done on the first Forza game for the original xbox? I've tried looking into the .carbin from the game, but could only find vertex data but only several submeshes contain face data, what could that possibly mean?

Can anyone make a script to open the forza horizon 4 .zip files for audio?

It gives me a message of "unsupported compression method" and is probably method 22 compression?

Nobody can dig into this and make a script to extract audio files with proper names?

Thanks to everyone who has been digging the game files and sharing their results here. I have summarized this knowledge into .carbin and .modelbin file patterns for the ImHex editor.
Work on the .modelbin is still in progress, but just for proof of concept, I made a converter that downgrades the .carbin file format from Forza Horizon 5 to Forza Horizon 4 so it opens with 3DSimED 3.2c.

The MBuf blob, which is also associated with the Mrph blob, is responsible for scaling rims and tires.
The Mrph blob contains N "weight[id]" lines. The MBuf blob contains N*2 cells in the following format

```
float16 y;
float16 z;
float16 weight_id;
```

They have the following order:

```
       ...
  N-2: x, y, z, 1
  N-1: x, y, z, 0
    N: x, y, z, N-1
       ...
N*2-2: x, y, z, 1
N*2-1: x, y, z, 0

```

These values are increments to the default vertex position. They are multiplied by a factor k, which is unique for each weight_id.
I've seen N=2 for rims and N=5 for tires.
For rims:

```
weight[0] is diameter, k = (WheelDiameterIN - 10) / 14

```

For tires:

```
weight[0] is outer radius, k = (TireWidthMM * Aspect / 100 - 225 + 12.7 * WheelOriginalDiameterIN) / 275

```

TireWidthMM, TireAspect, WheelOriginalDiameterIN - stock values, WheelDiameterIN - custom rim diameter (upgade).

In addition, the tire coordinates are multiplied by TireWidthMM along the X axis.

Here are the CRA_Series313 rim and the tireL_whiteWall tire from FH5 v1.405.2.0, imported under these rules with 145/80R10 parameters upgraded to 145/45R14 compared to the mesh ripped using Ninja Ripper 2. As you can see, they match exactly, except deformation caused by pressure on the bottom of the tire.
