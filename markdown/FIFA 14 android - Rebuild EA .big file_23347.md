These files are supported by Game Extractor, Dragon Unacker, MultiEx etc. Did you try them all?

More info here

There is also a Final BIG Editor which can add or delete files in the archive.

Edit: Try also big4f program.

So please upload a sample, because there are at least 3 types of BIG archives.
Also tell me full name of the game and a platform (because there are at least 30 FIFA games on several platforms... you need to be more precise)

Ok, I have checked your sample and it is standard BIGF archive.

You can use big4f to unpack, repack and add new files as you wish.
[https://github.com/withmorten/big4f](https://github.com/withmorten/big4f)

So you need to extract files first with command

```
big4f e/x <big file> <directory>
```


add your files and then pack it with command

```
big4f f/4 <directory> <big file>
```


Check this link if you will encounter any issues

To make it work you should put all files (BIGF archive, big4f etc.) in some directory on your desktop,
use "cd" command to go to that directory and execute something like this

```
big4f.exe e cro_base.big out_directory
```


Remember to check tutorials on cmd usage!

If your BIG file is in some other directory you have to specify full path for this file.
Also all paths with spaces should be conatined inside double quotes like

```
"C:\Users\User\Desktop\some file.big"
```

Yeah, for second sample just use BIG File Extractor [https://app.box.com/s/6g2lpct0trk1ylg11j4udcjso4bg4q9h](https://app.box.com/s/6g2lpct0trk1ylg11j4udcjso4bg4q9h)
It has a rebuild option.

Rebuild was completed and archive size is the same as the original, but there are
some changes in the offsets on the beginning of the archive.

So maybe it is just some bug in the tool. If that's the case,
you should report it to the author of this version in this topic

If you're lucky, he will fix it.
