- Post Title: NFS No Limits

Hello there!  
NFS no limits was released not long ago for IOS and I already have downloaded all the files.
Can you help me to get the stuff out?

The models are in .M3G format,which looks kinda like Real Racing 3 (EA title too) and the textures have .SBA expansion
*By the way,some textures can be opened in Dragon Unpacker 5 and they are PNG's*
The game has some awesome cars with extreme tuning parts,so it would be awesome to get acsess to them 
Also,the game uses "ISIS" engine

Here are the example files  

[http://www.mediafire.com/download/8baki ... LIMITS.rar](http://www.mediafire.com/download/8baki084ppisd5i/NFS_NO_LIMITS.rar)

[](http://www.imagebam.com/image/8a4890379696327)

The year was 2015,we were using 256x256 textures

I looked into it last night. Files are gzipped with what looks like a small custom header.

I didn't know Real Racing uses m3g as well, maybe it's the same format.

EDIT: I checked, it's not the same.
Real Racing 3 uses the old Java Mobile 3D Graphics API version 1, a format which is well known and documented.
No Limits uses either a custom derivative of the format, or the API version 2, of which I couldn't find any format specifications. It's also listed as "Dormant" on the Java website.

Hmmm,I thought it will be the same,because games were made by the same studio 
So,any chance we can get the models?

I was wondering to see some skins,like legendary "M3" skin,but I found a new folder with textures,in .SBA format
They are duplicates of others,but can't be opened in Dragon Unpacker 5

Strange,but i still can't find skins

Folder "published.texture_pvrtc" holds texture files,which can't be opened with Dragon Unpacker 5,and they seem to be the main game textures.

Faces are fine, at least for cars
[](http://www.imagebam.com/image/94f74e379827754) 

@Ferrari there are also some textures embedded in m3g files.

To be continued tomorrow, good night!

Great work! Keep It up! 

After analyzing some screenshots,I'm sure that cars have LOD's

In garage you can see the most detailed LOD 0 and In race,I beleive,LOD 1,because screenshots show me different details and every car in the game has separate LOD 0 model

This is epic!  

As I can see,the car is split in dozen parts,and @Chipicao has automatized the import process(?)
So,I don't know how this stuff works,but is there a way to automaticaly place parts at their positions?
(Or should we do this by hands?)

And if I'm right,the only thing missing now is UV's and normals?  

Would be amazing if you can find time and make a script\tool foor theese beautiful cars

Everything is fine once you use the correct vertex bias and scale:
[](http://www.imagebam.com/image/73a119380080468)
Assigning groups will probably put everything together even better.

UVs and normals are not missing, they are there and will be correctly loaded when everything else is ready. This is what's called a testing stage, you can;t expect to have everything in one go.

Because of required decompression (and other small things I've considered) I will not be making a MAXscript, but a FBX converter instead, similar to what I've done for Asphalt 8.

@Chipicao This is amazing 
Great news!  
Converter is a perfect type of tool  
Your asphalt 8 cobverter is awesome too 
So much body kits  
And what about lod's then? Although it is not so important,if it tooks the highest one

I suggest that someone make the all-m3g-supported script for 3ds Max.
In this software, I'd like to import not only NFS:NL's models but NFS:MW 2012's models anyway.

I'm not able to cope with the extraction of these models in the use of Mesh Extractor completely.

I do beleive that M3G's are different all the times.
Every game uses specific compression and stuff like that,so you can't predict every single one and make a universal tool.

We would probably get it long ago if it would be possible.  

And why do you need Mobile version of MW 2012? There's no special or interesting cars at all.
At least,you can get em from the PC version

I do have a working script for 3ds max but I won't release it. It would require an external quickbms script to decompress NFSNL files, not to mention the fact that it would be slow as always.

However, my M3G2FBX converter will work both NFS:NL and Real Racing 3, and if you say NFS:MW uses m3g as well, I'll have a look and add support if possible.
m3g models are indeed different from game to game, but they have as many similarities as differences, so it's not impossible.

In the mean time, here's a 8192x1024px view at all the tuning options, this time with vertex colors and complete transformations:

You did an amazing work!
And FBX converter is the best option.I don't think we need Max script if we can have a converter 
You also mentioned,that there's some textures inside theese m3g's,didn't you?
And if you want,i will convert Volkswagen's textures just right now for you for a test

Yes, it appears there are some textures embedded which my tool will extract. Another reason why maxscript would be a pain.

Ok 
Just i haven't found car skins and common textures like chassis or carbon fibre anywhere and I thought that they may be inside the cars

I can't open any texture from "published.texture_pvrtc" with Dragon Unpacker for some reason.
Only textures from "published" are openable for me.
Mabye I'm using wrong soft?

I haven't tried either. It's probably a format that Dragon Unpacker doesn't recognize, or maybe it's compressed.

I'll get to it later, after everything else is ready.

NFS:MW is almost identical to NFS:NL, so it will be supported without issues, even though models are really low-quality:

Tracks will work as well:

And RR3 has some very high-quality circuits (for a mobile game):

Just as I said about MW models  
Amazing work,Chipicao!
So excited
Yes,RR3 has great circuits like Laguna Seca .I've had a little problem after ripping RR3 circuits - I couldn't find a half of textures of it.
But mabye i was just searching badly.

My converter has been ready since Sunday, but I've been struggling with sba textures.
It's all a mess, multiple data chunks connected together like databases...

I might take a break so in the mean time here is the [M3G2FBX converter](http://www.mediafire.com/download/5b5gfesy459i4cg/M3G2FBX.zip).
- supports all models from RR3, NFS:MW and NFS:NL
- All LODs with normals, UV coordinates, vertex colors, hierarchy, transformations, materials, and texture names (for reference only)

Usage options:
- drag&drop an m3g file to convert it
- double click the exe to convert any m3g file from the current folder
- use the command line to specify a file: M3G2FBX.exe input_file.m3g
- same thing with a folder or a path, only this time it will include all subfolders: M3G2FBX.exe input_folder

FBX files will always be saved in the same place as their m3g couterparts.


I converted all 2196 m3g files from the above 3 games to check for faults, but obviously I wasn't able to visually inspect all models. So let me know if you find any issues.

Here's what I know so far about the SBA.
The file structure itself is very straight-forward:

```
int32 version

struct dataBlock
{
   int32 dataIdentifier; //4byte string
   int32 dataLength; //not including identifier, length or checksum
   int32 checksum;
   byte[] data;
}
```

This structure is looped until the end of the file, and each one is aligned to 4 bytes (although only CDAT needs it)

There are several types:
"ENUM", "STRU": groups of shorts(usually 6) that may give additional information about the other structures that follow
"FIEL": group of shorts; unknown at this point
"OHDR": presumably acts like a header with reading instructions for the "DATA" that follows
"DATA": contains texture properties such as format, width, height, mipmaps
"CHDR": header for the "char data block"; contains pairs of int32 offsets and lengths used to read strings
"CDAT": char data block from which strings are read using "CHDR"; the strings are null-terminated, but that's probably part of the writing process, not the reading
Examples: ImageFormatType, TextureFilterType, TextureWrapType, Image, format, data, width, height, Texture, mipmaps, filter_min, filter_mag, wrap_s, wrap_t, default, RGB, RGBA, PVRTC_2BPP_RGB, PVRTC_2BPP_RGBA, PVRTC_4BPP_RGBA, PVRTC_4BPP_RGB, DXT1, DXT3, DXT5, ATC_RGB, ATC_RGBA_Explicit, ATC_RGBA_Interpolated, ETC_RGB, PNG, JPEG, Nearest, Linear, NearestMipmapNearest, NearestMipmapLinear, LinearMipmapNearest, LinearMipmapLinear, Repeat, ClampToEdge
"BULK": unknown at this point; could be used to link everything together
"ALGN": used for the sole purpose of aligning the image data
"BARG" contains the actual image data

In case of PNG textrues the image data inside "BARG" is the whole PNG file and just needs to be extracted. That's why Dragon Unpacker can find them easily.
In case of DXT or PVR, the texture headers need to be rebuilt, that's why it's important to parse "DATA" properly and read everything.

The way I see it, property strings from CHDR need to be linked to property types and then to actual values from DATA in order to have enough information to rebuild texture headers.
It's just a matter oh "how"

Yeah, it may be a bit confusing. What I mean is texture names and file paths are registered, but they will fail to load.
So at the very least you will know what kind of texture should be used for a specific material.

Here is a small tool I made to convert textures: [http://www.mediafire.com/download/m00pm ... aBrute.zip](http://www.mediafire.com/download/m00pmunv9vjbvsg/sbaBrute.zip)
It is by no means a "true" converter. It basically guesses the image format and number of mipmaps based in width, height and image data size.
Only for NFS:NL! Most textures are successfully converted, except cube maps and some special sba files.

I have also updated M3G2FBX:
- fixed a small issue with rotations
- added option to make mesh names unique, useful if you plan to convert FBX to OBJ; usage: M3G2FBX -u file/folder
- the tool will now actively search for textures that have been converted with sbaBrute; keep textures in their original location or in the same folder as the model

I suggest you remove any special characters from folder names, for example the ™ in NFS NL, otherwise textures may not load.

Please re-download M3G2FBX. I have fixed a serious issue that prevented reading UVs on certain models, including a few cars.

Thanks to Automotive Gaming for pointing it out.

> Here is a small tool I made to convert textures: http://www.mediafire.com/download/m00pm ... aBrute.zip
It is by no means a "true" converter. It basically guesses the image format and number of mipmaps based in width, height and image data size.
Only for NFS:NL! Most textures are successfully converted, except cube maps and some special sba files.

I have also updated M3G2FBX:
- fixed a small issue with rotations
- added option to make mesh names unique, useful if you plan to convert FBX to OBJ; usage: M3G2FBX -u file/folder
- the tool will now actively search for textures that have been converted with sbaBrute; keep textures in their original location or in the same folder as the model

I suggest you remove any special characters from folder names, for example the ™ in NFS NL, otherwise textures may not load.

wow great... can u please share the garage FBX model???
Thanks

Um, is a support for NFS:HP possible (as it uses M3G for models as well)?

Hello,
The obb of this game is not extractable. I tried Ninja Ripper but the ripped models look as if they are crushed from all side. They are like a box.
When using the nfs_no_limits.bms script I get error as it's not the expected "ZBIN" instead it's "ZBDS".
They have changed the format. So does anyone has any knowledge how to extract the obb?
Anyone knows which was the last rippable version of this game??

Note: if you're gonna copy files to another folder, don't forget about the folders of the same names as the corresponding pack files, if there were any. Or you can simply leave the whole data folder untouched, the script will automatically create an individual folder for outputs.

I sending new samples. I hope someone will make script for .sb3d, .sba script need update beacuse I can only extract textures with alpha channel. In my view, the most important is models, texture can be extract using Ninja Ripper + Android Emulator on PC.

Did you still working of converter for No Limits? Textures we can get using Ninja Ripper+emulator for Windows but models with correct UV isn't possible.

No. I don't have the time for fiddling any more - just working on models when there's sufficient infos.

Here "I only have that wheel file mrstyx extracted" where he said it's modified then vanished (for ever?).

Hello,

There is really not possble to extract 3d models from .sb3d files, even they are uncompressed?

I mean, thanks to "DKDave" on Discord (thank you!), that made a script to uncompress the .sb3d files, once extracted it, there are like ~700 files from 1KB to 277 KB heavy, where I think there are stored the 3d models.

BUT I tried to open this file in 3d Model Researcher, but being me so ignorant in read hex code, I can't find the start address for vertices 

SO there is once again a way to open NFS: No Limits 3d models? 

P.s. here a folder with the chunk files: [https://www.dropbox.com/s/4lmr5haze130d ... s.rar?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/4lmr5haze130dhw/BMW_M3_GTR_Extracted_chunks.rar?dl=0)

The files extracted are bunch of vertex and face buffer (except for the largest one who contains the model information), for example, the file 359 is a vertex buffer that goes with the file 27, which is a face buffer.



(But you can see it need some scaling, which is exactly the same problem for the wheel that was posted)

yeah, I see, giving it a 2nd try seems it's a matter of "relative to absolute face indices conversion" for the wheel I previously dealt with
(or of collecting sub meshes one by one):

Just a bit more info ... the very last block (688 in this case) contains the data on how to put all of the meshes together.  If I can work it out, it should be scriptable (is that a word?).

@shakotay - This file contains the x/z/y scale at the start as 0.96, 0.80, 2.25 (rounding down for simplicity), so your wild guess is about right

Where did you find the scale ? Because It seems that the bounding box is tied to the scale and the position of the mesh, I think ? (I'm a bit a noob at this stuff, so I can be completely wrong)

The scale looks to be the 3 floats at offset 0x20 - they seem to match with Shakotay's info, but that could just be a coincidence!

So I wrote a (unfinished) blender script. However, the problem is, it's my first steps in blender scripting so you will need to install the [zstandard module](https://pypi.org/project/zstandard/) with this [tutorial ](http://www.codeplastic.com/2019/03/12/how-to-install-python-modules-in-blender/) (since I don't know how to do a blender addon with a module included), and then go the scripting tab and run the script here.
(The script I made is for the version 2.8, so I don't know If it's going to work for the later versions.)



While it look fine here, I kinda have doubt on how the meshes are placed (Not seen here, but some car model have the chassis just under them). And the way I placed the mesh according to the bounding box is kind of dumb. While the normals are read, some mesh still doesn't look smooth, and some UV are broken (or need scaling ?)

(it's funny that this topic is trending since I was working on this format last week, what a coincidence)

Chipicao's tool worked greatly. It just doesn't support the latest models because of the newer encryption, but I'm sure that the 3D format is the same. Wouldn't it be better to just continue his work instead of doing the research for this completely from scratch?

the SB3D format is really different than the M3G format from what I've seen, they did more than just add a compression in the new format. If you're talking about the vertex attributes, then, yeah, it would be lucky if it didn't change.

Oddly enough, the textures (.sba) doesn't seem to have changed, but for some reasons, the program (sbabrute) doesn't work.

By the way, It is possible to program a bounding box function from Advanced Mesh Reaper in blender ? It seems that the matrices at the start are important for the placement of the body kit.

So it's not sure whether he would agree that someone takes up/continues his work.

When you have a look at GreenTrafficLight's import_sb3d.py script, it's really great, imho.  

@GreenTrafficLight: it's your script, is it? Because it reads: "author": "Test"

btw: getting rotation/translation from a matrix is not too hard. Decide what type, 3x4, 4x4?
But having a look at mesh_bumper_rear_paint_a_lod00, 0x1EE70 for the bmw_m3, it might be quaternion rotation then translation (or vice versa, just a wild guess).

I only have basic knowledge about model format, but I guess those are 4x4 matrix. Something I noticed is that the float value -0.52 appear a lot, which fit for the translation of the body kit (for example, here, it seems the front bumper fit perfectly the body kit under it, could be just a coincidence though) :

I've managed to analyse the format in a bit more detail, and I can now see the information for which vertex files are matched with the relevant face files - some vertex sections also use more than 1 face file.

Those float tables near the start of the file seem to be skeleton data of some sort - standard 4 x 4 Float matrices.  In the Lamborghini file, there are 1060 entries of 0x40 bytes each, followed by another 1060 entries of 0x40 bytes each.  The first set is the normal matrix, the second could be inverse matrix data.  The table following this is the bone parent information.  After that you've got another table related to the bones, with names and other info, which could also be some matrix data.  Then you've got separate tables for the face and vertex information.  It's very convoluted!

I'm still trying to work some of it out (if nobody else already has), but there's lots of relative offsets to consider, and lots of unknown values.

yeah, too many parts. I made a list of possible translation values from the BMW M3 matrices, but only a few values are >1.0 or < -1.0.
(examples)

#   16     0x4c0:  0.945146 0.045282 1.545409 1.000000 
#   17     0x500:  -0.952803 0.032095 1.538241 1.000000 

I did move (and scale  ) the rear bumper manually:

(Don't have the sb3d file, the chunks only, so can't tell, whether the importer places that bumper correct already.
Plus dunno, whether it's really mesh_plastic_bumper_rear_a_lod0 that I used.)


When I have more spare time I'll care for porsche_911_gt3_991.sb3d, but from a quick glance the importer put all pieces correct.
edit: well, see, the "usual suspects"  , mesh_plastic_bumper_rear_a_lod00 is misplaced there (scaling correct), z coord too deep, it's easy to correct manually.
Same goes for mesh_headlight_cluster_a_lod00, y pos affected, too.

Yeah, those pieces are the reasons why I think the matrix at the start play a role in their position. 

I found that the matrix at the start aren't ordered, each mesh has a bone index (as highlighted in the image, at offset 0x275DC) which is tied to the matrix. For example, the mesh_bumper_rear_plastic_a_lod00 has a bone index of 301



Each matrix does 64 bytes, so 64 * 301 = 19264, which give the matrix located at 0x4BD0, that has a y translation of -5.96046447753906E-8. And when I try this translation in blender, the mesh does not move (as seen at the top-left).





However, I tried with the inverse matrix (they start at 0x8FD0), which is the matrix at 0xDB10, that has a y translation of 0.555474698543549 (the x coord is -1.18329133138289E-32 and doesn't move the mesh), the plastic rear bumper placed perfectly with the other mesh.





I tried with mesh_headlight_cluster_a_lod00 and it seems to work, it had the same y translation (bone index of 374, matrix at 0x5E10 and inverse matrix at 0xED50).

All of this can be a coincidence though, but It's the same problem that Chipicao had before.

Everything is fine once you use the correct vertex bias and scale:

Assigning groups will probably put everything together even better.

So, yeah, the matrix did play a role in the position of some of the object. I don't know what is the purpose of the inversed matrix though. 





Still, there are still plenty of things left like the normals (the rear bumper of the porsche doesn't look smooth) and the scale/position of UV. And also the hierarchy.

(btw, I managed to bring the origin to the center of the mesh instead of being at the bottom-right. And don't try to go into edit mode when you select all the object, it will crash Blender instantly).

quote from quora.com, Zachary Bingham:
"The only problem arises when we want to divide a matrix, as there is no division operation that can be applied to the matrix. Thus, we have the Inverse."

Seems it's faster to have those inverse matrices present in (RAM) data instead of calculating them during runtime.

Some issues what I find:
- Mesh doesen't smooth when export in Blender and import in 3ds Max
- Some parts have problem with UV Map, when model import in 3ds Max (.obj and Evo VI)
and what about textures? The only method what I know is NOX + Ninja Ripper maybe somebody making faster method?
Function from NFS Hot Pursuit/Most Wanted importer will be awesome - when import new file, scene will be reset.

For pack files from newer version game, use this script.
NFSNL_packUnpacker.zip


Note: if you're gonna copy files to another folder, don't forget about the folders of the same names as the corresponding pack files, if there were any. Or you can simply leave the whole data folder untouched, the script will automatically create an individual folder for outputs.

and also this script (for me) don't unpack all files, some cars is missing just like DMC or 718 Cayman GT4.

Am I doing the conversion from byte to decimal wrong ?  Because I wonder if it's why normal are broken.

```
n2 = vertexBuffer.readByte() / 127;
n3 = vertexBuffer.readByte() / 127;
normals.append([n1,n2,n3])

```


Edit : Seems to be char rather than byte ? (I don't know how to convert a char to decimal in python)




Edit 2 : So I remplaced the code with

```
n2 = vertexBuffer.readByte() * 2 / 255;
n3 = vertexBuffer.readByte() * 2 / 255;
normals.append([n1,n2,n3])

```


Which gave me almost the same results as Advanced Mesh Reaper



However, Blender doesn't apply the normals and I don't know why.

Nope, it seems to apply to all parts.

It's weird because it's seems that converting normals from byte to float doesn't seem to work on blender. For example, I did a blender version of the [Captain Tsubasa Rise of New Champions noesis script](https://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=22608), and it's also have the same problem since it's also use unsigned bytes to store the normals. 
(left is ripped with Advanced Mesh Reaper, right is ripped with the script)



However, when I was working on a blender script for Initial D Arcade Stage, the normals worked fine because they are stored as float.



I will probably try to do something like [DGIorio blender scripts](https://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=19910&start=15) which use the bmesh function to create the mesh, to see if it change anything.

Edit 2 : So I remplaced the code with
Code: Select alln1 = vertexBuffer.readByte() * 2 / 255;
n2 = vertexBuffer.readByte() * 2 / 255;
n3 = vertexBuffer.readByte() * 2 / 255;
normals.append([n1,n2,n3])
For unsigned integer types, what you need to do is to normalize the values into the interval [0, 2], and then shift them into [-1, 1].
In this case for unsigned bytes, you need to edit your code like this:

```
n2 = vertexBuffer.readByte() * 2 / 255 - 1.0;
n3 = vertexBuffer.readByte() * 2 / 255 - 1.0;
normals.append([n1,n2,n3])

```

But make sure this "readByte" method actually read as unsigned byte instead of signed one.

Probably it's because the values from your convertion fall   out of the range of -1 to +1, so Blender just discarded everything. Just a wild guess though.

> But make sure this "readByte" method actually read as unsigned byte instead of signed one.
Using GreenTrafficLight's code (typo correction 'b' ->'B')

```
        return struct.unpack(self.endian + "B", self.read(1))[0]
```


then
n1 = vertexBuffer.readUByte() * 2 / 255 - 1.0;
...

I couldn't get better results - best results I got not creating the normals by the script and letting blender do the job.
But we need the texture for the normals (bump map?) to judge.

Well, I couldn't see the images posted by GreenTrafficLight earlier. But from that screenshot where AMR interpretated the data as "char", you can clearly see that the square sum (the value on the right of the arrow) of every vector approximately equals to 1.0 within the acceptable error range. That's the most convincing evidence that the data type must be "char", or signed byte.

The error between using the formula

```

```

and

```

```

is really insignificant and you can even use 128 as the divisor if you'd like to. So from my point of view this problem isn't actually related to the convertion.

I wrote the script using the BMesh functions this time (well, to be honest, I copy-pasted since DGIorio did already something perfect), but i'm getting the error "Found the same (BMVert) used multiple times" (which can be fixed with a try/except). This error concern some mesh like mesh_glass_windows_a_lod01 (bmw_m3_gtr), but the mesh is still generated and doesn't have any problems. So I don't know if it's really a big issue.



The problem is, I feel that using these functions has more chance for blender to crash (like sometimes, using the script more than 3 times will crash, and sometimes, it will be fine). but the good news is, the normals are actually applied.
(Top is from Advanced Mesh Reaper, Bottom is from the script)



I think it's a problem related to Blender and not the convertion itself.
(Auto-smooth gives a different result, so It doesn't work as a fix)



P.S : The script is not finished at 100%

And for the UV coordinates? There are any news?

Some vertex buffer have different format, for example, at stride 24, some start at 12 and others start at 20.

And sadly turn out that the normals is kind of right, but also broken, the traffic_dodge_charger has a broken normal on the right side and selecting it in edit mode fix it, but also break all the other normals (that apply to all model)

(left is Advanced Mesh Reaper, right is from the script)


(It seems that normal are the right one, it must be something to fix in the blender script)


(Entering a mesh in edit mode break all the normals)


Man, Blender is so weird to work it, I kinda wish there was a way to attach the zstandard module to a noesis script (which I tried but didn't work)

Isn't too much normals? AE86 rear fenders doesn't look good.
Edit:
F355 also looking "plastic". Rear bumper of E46 looking nice but not perfect. Idk maybe it's problem only in my.

For me it looks fine (not perfect, though  ).

(But I have to admit that I didn't understand what you meant exactly with: "(Entering a mesh in edit mode break all the normals)"
 for your latest picture. The surface not to be perfectly smooth? Or those darker and brighter Areas?)

edit: well, I see, when rotating the reimported lod00 model around and around, it doesn't look perfect. (But for me it's ok.)

Yeah, but the reason why I think normals are important is because people will probably use these models in mods, and I think broken normals will change a lot how the model will look like in-game.   (But I admit I would have liked to ignore this problem   )

Yep, the surface isn't smooth since it's changed when you enter the selected object in edit mode.

(What the mesh look like before you enter in edit mode)


(What the mesh look like after you enter in edit mode, notice the darker faces that appeared)


I think it related to the fact that the mesh have duplicate vertex that aren't connected (which makes Blender to recalculate the normals). Sadly, merging the vertices doesn't solve the problem.

I can't believe that there were 2556 doubles in the lod00 I mentioned before, so removing doubles leads to 5431 -2556 = 2875 remaining vertices. Unbelievable. 

Even better, newer blender version have the merging by distance feature now, surprise.

Welp, I hate myself, turn out that fixing this problem is really simple (man, I've been on this for three days and tested everything except this), [thank to this code](https://github.com/Turk645/Hedgehog-Engine-2-Mesh-Blender-Importer/blob/main/io_import_hedgehog_engine.py)

I just had to remplace

```
normals.append([n1,n2,n3])
```


with

```
normals.append(Vector((n1,n2,n3)).normalized())
```


And now, there isn't any problem, also the normals aren't reset when you go into edit mode.

(the left is the one from Advanced Mesh Reaper, just saying)




(I hope I'm not wrong this time   , this is probably the only best solution that I have found)

Still, there are problems like, sometimes the car_decal_placement_shell crash Blender when you edit it. And plenty of things that I still need to add.

Hello,

I noticed that there are also many .sb files, in seperate folders (like Bodykits), I think there are prefabs, but prefabs for what? Idk if there fits into the 3d models but my guess is of yes.

In chase, I attached an example here.

.sb files is scripts in game like gamemodes, physcic, customize info etc. In my view is unnecessary files. The most importat with models and textures is sb3d and sba.

Need For Speed No Limits have different textures in different devices. Using script by Bigchillghost I can ONLY (from my version in mobile phone) extract textures with alpha channel but textures from Iphone looking like diffrent format.
Here is samples from Porsche 911 (991) GT3 R.S:

Sorry I do not speak english very well.

I wanted some NFS:NL cars and I'm new to 3d modeling

How do I extract cars and transfer them to the blender?
Can someone make a tutorial? Please

So I wrote a (unfinished) blender script. However, the problem is, it's my first steps in blender scripting so you will need to install the zstandard module with this tutorial  (since I don't know how to do a blender addon with a module included), and then go the scripting tab and run the script here.
(The script I made is for the version 2.8, so I don't know If it's going to work for the later versions.)



While it look fine here, I kinda have doubt on how the meshes are placed (Not seen here, but some car model have the chassis just under them). And the way I placed the mesh according to the bounding box is kind of dumb. While the normals are read, some mesh still doesn't look smooth, and some UV are broken (or need scaling ?)

(it's funny that this topic is trending since I was working on this format last week, what a coincidence)

Everything was explain here. Tool isn't complete. Please read topic and don't do spam...

In the new version of Blender, theres no needed install the zstandard module, because it comes already included in blender, but the sb3d importer crashes with the Beck kustom model
