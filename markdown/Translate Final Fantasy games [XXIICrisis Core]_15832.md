- Post Title: Translate Final Fantasy games [X/XII/Crisis Core]

Hi all!

I'm new at the forum and i'm searching some help. We translated Final Fantasy X in word documents and now we want to put it into the game somehow. There is any working method to make this?

We have Final Fantasy 6,7,8,9 in our language and we want to translate Final Fantasy X, XII and Crisis Core. Can you give me some advise and links which game have a good text extractor/inputor?

Thanks for the help!
