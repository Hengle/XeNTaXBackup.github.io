First, clarify what language you're talking about. Is it JavaScript or Java? Those two are completely different and unrelated languages, and it's hard to tell which one you're referring to. Second, are you trying to modify/make code for an existing program, or create something new?

Once you tell me what language you're using, I'm going to send you off to some website that provides a beginner's guide to that language.
