Hello how are you.
I've been trying for a long time to get the models and textures of this game that until now I couldn't.
Is there a way to get them?
what I found was a folder called CARS and its extension .car (in the internal files) What are the names of the cars, I have no idea if they are models or textures, I also have no knowledge of how to extract.
Thanks for your time
