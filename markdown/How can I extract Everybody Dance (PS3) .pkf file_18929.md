Hey guys, I'm just trying to extract the ".pkf" file from a PS3 dance game called "Everybody Dance"
Does anyone know how to extract it?

Thank you so much, I wonder if there is a way to extract these files. They are from Everybody Dance too.
No idea if they are extract-able or not.

The files are encrypted. Not much I can do there.
