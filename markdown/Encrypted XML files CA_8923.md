Hello,

i'm new here in this community and want to help, but need help too.
If i can help i will help you, if someone needs help please pm me.

At the moment i have a problem. ( >.< )
I need help by decrypting some encrypted .txt files.
I don't know how they got encrypted or something else. 
The files are from Combat arms.
I can't upload them all, but if someone is interested to help me, i will send him/her the files.

I hope you can help me.
