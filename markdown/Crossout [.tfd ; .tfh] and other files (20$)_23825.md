I could pay someone to convert models from .mdl to .obj or any other 3d extension? I have already tried crowbar and 3DModelConverter. It says unsupported type of mdl... All scripts for Noesis that I found here to unpack the mdl files aren't working.

Upd: could you also provide a script/tell me how to decompile it?
Upd2: all my mdl decompiled files are 128KB, maybe script is broken? I've attached it.

Thanks!

You're talking of blender!? 
But "ns" is your Noesis folder? I'd suggest a fresh install of Noesis (see zip here, [https://richwhitehouse.com/index.php?co ... project=91](https://richwhitehouse.com/index.php?content=inc_projects.php&showproject=91))

Tried the script without a problem:

Detected file type: Crossout (v940)

I have reinstalled Noesis :/
I just put my script in noesisv442/plugins/python and run it from Command Prompt.

What could I do with these files? Is it possible to view them in 3d?

The script is not assumed to be started from the command line. Just start Noesis.exe.

btw: your (real?) user name is displayed in your uploaded pictures.  Usually you would make it unreadable.

I have started it from Noesis and got errors (scroll up) I sent. And yes, I know that you could see my username there, is it bad?

Yeah, but that is still not my real name, that's why I don't care 

Could you please check your DMs?

image size is displayed as 2k x 1k, while filesize is 128k only.

Seems Acewell needs to have a look at...

But, simple enough, I gave it a fake DDS header to get:

I have unpacked new .grp file, as I see, there is no way to open this model in 3d? Would appreciate if someone could teach me :v

Thanks!

Thanks!I'd say so. If you uploaded a small .grp file someone could have a look at.

If you have a look at this thread there's grp files without compression, but dunno whether it's different grps:
