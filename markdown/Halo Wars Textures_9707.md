- Post Title: Halo Wars Textures

Had a look at Texture files for models in Halo Wars, and the footer had something very interesting:

```
SYS603.hwbuilds.c:\phoenix\xbox\work\art\flood\infantry\infectionform_01\infectionform_01_df.tga.DDXCONV -smart -file %s -xbox -compressedProfiles.
```

Would someone like to have a look at the format for me?
