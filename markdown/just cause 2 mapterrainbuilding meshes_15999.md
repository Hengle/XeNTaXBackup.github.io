- Post Title: just cause 2 map/terrain/building meshes?

hello,

has anyone tried to export terrain/map/building meshes from just cause 2 (or other just cause title)? i found a tool that let you view models and export them but according to the description, it works only with vehicles and some characters:
[https://justcause2mods.com/mods/just-ca ... itor-jcce/](https://justcause2mods.com/mods/just-cause-content-editor-jcce/)

is there an alternative tool that allow us to export just cause 2 meshes (especially buildings/terrain/map meshes)?
