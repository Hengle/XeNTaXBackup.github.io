- Post Title: Source code for Jedi Academy and Jedi Outcast released

With the closure of LucasArts, Raven Software has released the source code for two Star Wars games. I am sure it may interest some people here on the forums. 

Read the story here:

Indeed. I'd given up hope on this ever happening. I'm rather giddy and am planning on starting a googlecode project or something with it in the near future.

- Post Title: Source code for Jedi Academy and Jedi Outcast released

Recently a total of three sources were released:

[http://jkhub.org/topic/1941-jedi-academ ... -released/](http://jkhub.org/topic/1941-jedi-academy-and-jedi-outcast-source-code-released/)

The original two, dubbed 'jedioutcast' and 'jediacademy' are actually Jedi Academy for PC, and Jedi Academy for Xbox, respectively. The original Jedi Outcast source was later uploaded. I'm excited mostly for the fact that the Xbox source includes the complete code for Vicarious Visions' GOB/GFC container format, which was used on several games like Jedi Outcast/Academy, Crash Nitro Kart, and Doom 3 (all console versions). Hopefully someone will be able to use the source to create an archive tool so I can create some console-based mods on these games.

Wow, I wonder if the assets can be imported to another game...

I don't see any reason why the assets and such couldn't be made into mods for other games. Though if you mean like, using them as part of another game probably not.
