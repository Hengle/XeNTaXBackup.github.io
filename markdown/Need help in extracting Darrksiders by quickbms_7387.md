- Post Title: Need help in extracting Darrksiders by quickbms

Hi everybody,I'm trying to extract the Darksiders'resource by quickbms and take the files which is oppc type into HxD to see files content, but there has no correct path to read and something like "diff_spec_norm_emis_rimlight_diffcolor†Ð.ÙU9….!" in it.Does it be encrypted?
I'm studying quickbms now and read some script, like "[viewtopic.php?f=29&t=5090&view=previous](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=29&t=5090&view=previous)". I don't know how to discern which is the NAME, OFFSET, ZSIZE and SIZE from "clog NAME OFFSET ZSIZE SIZE".
Thank you for reading the question and answer them.
