- Post Title: GfxExport 2.x?

Hi all, 

Modding some older Bioware UI (the old Dragon age games), and using GfxExport 3.x from the very old UDK 3 source for DA2 and it works fine, but the original DAO doesn't like GfxExport 3.x that works with DA2 (GfxVersion 3.3.88) 

Was hoping that someone in the community has an older version of Scaleform/GfxExport (UDK starts with GfxExport 3.x, the earliest we found is GFxExport v3.110 for SDK v3.3.89)

Any help? 

Thanks!
