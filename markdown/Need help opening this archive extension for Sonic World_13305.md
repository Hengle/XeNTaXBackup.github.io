- Post Title: Need help opening this archive extension for Sonic World

Hi, my name is Bobby, I am trying to find a way to open this file from this Blitz Sonic game, I am a game modder and I tried dragon unpacker and it only extracts a few objects, mostly .jpg2000 images which are only 18 at the most, I have Quickbms, but that is useless unless I can find someone who can write a script for it, I would write one but don't know where to start, here is a screenshot of the archive I'm trying to open. [](http://postimage.org/)

It would be better if we talk to each other more than ever.

Is it possible to post here the file? Or send it by PM?
