- Post Title: Rise and Fall .gr2

Hi

I'm currently trying to mod this game i extracted the archive using help of this forum thx to all guys (bugtest)
and found some gr2 models and gr2 animations separated so i've downloaded granny viewer and gr2->ms tool
and started converting gr2s to mss (but they look tiny in 3ds max  (now i'm going to get 2008 for trying the other tool)
i was able to modify a hero model (from Greece team) and it worked but   all animations stopped from working, now i have a idle hero to play with,so if somebody has a way to convert .gr2 animations and reexport them to max back to .gr2 (i mean make them work again) i need help
when using the .gr2->.ms with the separated animation files the result was (this gr2 doesn't contains models , ill just give up)   
Help me plz 
thx

(for examining files pm or contact me)

You managed to convert a model back to .gr2??  
I'm not aware of any code that extracts granny animations nor do I know any tool to convert 3ds back to gr2.

yes I've did like what I've said the tools are form site   the secret is that you need to know what you need to export but it's now without animation 
so i really to need to make animations (which i'm not able to do now) i've contacted the site feedback no reply yet (he's not logging to net so much he's last visit was 1 month to this forum) so i'm seeking another help.

thx anyway
