- Post Title: [PC] Higurashi Daybreak (.dat)

I would like to know if someone could help me out with this one.
So:

-Every bit of data of this game is within 7 files (no subfolders with additional data, just those 7 files).
-They are in .dat format
-Most of them are at least 500MB - 1GB size
-Two of them are around 40 MBs, I could send one of those to the person who is willing to work on this

.dat format is an format used by most of the game developers, because I've seen it a lot.
So I think this shouldn't be too hard to extract.

The extension is common, but that doesn't say anything about the contents of the file.

Well, then I don't know what to say, then.

There are 7 data files (no folders, except one, but it doesn't contain any other data),
And there are three files that are over 1GB (I guess these are the ones where the models are), and two of them are over 40MB (I guess these are for sounds and pictures).
There is another one which is over 430MB (This is probably the one with music or few more models).

I guess I can send the .dat files that are 40MBs to someone who wants to at least take a look at them.
