I think this look pretty easy. Not knowing too much about Unreal I searched for tools and I got this: 
[http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/re ... ools.shtml](http://www.planetquake.com/polycount/resources/unreal/tools.shtml)

Looking thoruhg them by the end I spot that 3ds Max exporters and importers are available. So to answer your question, on the 1st glance  you need 3DSMax, but perhaps there are any other plug ins I am not aware which export/import from and to  other more freeware 3D programs. 

Again , perhaps I should sit put here and let the others more knowledgeable take a lead in replying to your Q.

Milkshape supports many game format conversions and is inexpensive.

Thanks all
But my problem is when Unreal combine their mesh (.3d or else) into .u* they have some conversion progress. Then when we extracted .ukx files we recieve .mesh and .meshanimation file. And their format is different, I can't found their format description and tools to show or convert them... Help me pls...

> But my problem is when Unreal combine their mesh (.3d or else) into .u* they have some conversion progress.
Let us try to go step by step. This first: what export tool are you using with whicj of the 3D editors (what version of that editor)  and what are the formats: ".3d" and ".u*" exactly?

Let me explain:
Base mesh format of Unreal engine is .3d, when we export from Max/Maya/etc format is .3d
But when we combined them into Unreal package (they are .ukx, .usx, utx...) that file .3d have conversion.
We used Game Extractor or UTPT to extractor .ukx file, that tool only listing .mesh and .meshanimation, .skeleton (or some else) and can extract them.
I think they are is conversion format of .3d
.3d is useable (conversion, render...)
and at last, I wanna convert .mesh, .meshanimation to useable format
Thanks

Here is I found another link 
[http://unreal.epicgames.com/Models.htm](http://unreal.epicgames.com/Models.htm) about modeling for Unreal. Tell me if it is helpful.

I have just installed Unreal on my drive.  Imagine I have picked up the Unreal Gold for $ .25  ...yes 25 cents,  but it sat in the wrapper until now. So I guess it was waiting for this occasion. I have no idea where I am going here, but together perhaps we wont get lost. So ... are we exporting or importing stuff here?

EDIT: 
[http://unreal.epicgames.com/Packages.htm](http://unreal.epicgames.com/Packages.htm) 
This is the part of the above linked article. It is quite complex and serious, but I bet that your answers are there.
