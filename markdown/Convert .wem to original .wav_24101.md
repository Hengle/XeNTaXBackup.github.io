- Post Title: Convert .wem to original .wav

I'm trying to find something that converts this .wem file to the original .wav but i was only able to convert it using vgmstream and it cuts off at around 18kHz. This .wem file is taken from Mafia Definitive Edition.

File: [https://www.mediafire.com/file/g9fdysa6 ... 4.wem/file](https://www.mediafire.com/file/g9fdysa67ihoc3u/460381424.wem/file)
Sorry for external. File too large....

If you rename the file to *.wem and drop it into Foobar with the vgmstream plugin, you can play/convert it from there with no problems.
