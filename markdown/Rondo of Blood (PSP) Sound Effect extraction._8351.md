- Post Title: Rondo of Blood (PSP) Sound Effect extraction.

Hello.

Someone on romhacking.net reccomended I come here for a question I have. I'll repost what I said there...

> As some of you my know I've been working on an English patch for the PCE version of Rondo of Blood that also includes the English dub from the PSP version.
>
> What I would like to use in the next release is a clean rip of the dub directly from the PSP in order to use the best possible quality (I was using the audio from YouTube videos before). 
>
> 
>
> I’ve already ripped a majority of the dub from the PSP since most of it was just in plan at3 format, but there’s still a small portion of it missing, all of which is voices that play during boss fights.

> I’m guessing these clips are considered sound effects and are include in a file called “_SE_ALL_E.BIN” which is 12.4 MB (13,054,016 bytes) and in the same directory is a file named “_se_all_e.h” which seems to have the audio from the bin file mapped out. Here is what they look like in MadEdit…
