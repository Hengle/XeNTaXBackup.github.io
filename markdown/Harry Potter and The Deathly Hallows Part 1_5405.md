I am currently downloading the PS3 version. For the moment I can only see *.pck files in there. The first 4 bytes are "AKPK", so it seems it's a relative to the *.pck files from Assassins Creed/II. I tried Rick's script for one of the files and it crashed, I guess it needs a little tweak.

PC version

Ok - i find way to uncrypt language files 

in total commander with plugin wcx_gaup_plugin_0.6.0.3pro.rar and 
rename frontend~frontend_eng_us.bin.gz to frontend~frontend_eng_us.bin
and then go to file and push buttons ctrl+page down it will be opened like archive

or same do Xentax MultiEx Commander if file rename frontend~frontend_eng_us.bin.gz to frontend~frontend_eng_us.lzb

Decompression and compression archive is "zlib" 

for compression back can use aplzltsetup.exe - u can found it in google.

Do u know where is language texts? probably in files

frontend~frontend_eng_us.bin.gz
frontend~frontendlocation_eng_us.bin.gz

I was try found how to extract texts ,but I dont found it.

I think - this is head - xÚě}. 78 DA EC 7D 0B 7C

Post these 2 files if possible, i would appreciate it.  

The 78DA header is definetely zlib compression.

It's hard work to translate the file format without any. 
- Looking at the file and see which parts are obvious. 
- Try changing the small things and to save again and see if the file will change accordingly. 
- Reverse save the game as its algorithm, the construction of a file, how to write. Search tips there.

IT SHOWs ONLY the FILE LIST, but better then nothing.

```
get POCET long

PRINT "HEAD (HLAVICKA): %HLAVICKA%"
PRINT "COUNT (POCET): %POCET%"   

for i = 0 < POCET
	
	get ID long
	get FILENAME STRING

	PRINT "ID: %ID%"       
	PRINT "NAME (JMENO): %FILENAME%"  

next i

```
