- Post Title: Help extracting information from Mortal Kombat 11 (MK11) mko files

Hello,

Can someone help me extract information from Mortal Kombat 11 (MK11) mko files?

MK11 uses oodle and zlib compression and although the mko files contain readable information with an HEX editor, there's lots of information there that I don't know how to extract.

Can someone help? I've tried some quickbms scripting, but I suck at it.

Here are two examples of mko files in annex. Any help is welcomed. 

Thanks.

Edit: I cannot attach the files, so here are the links
