- Post Title: .awc converting

Hello y'all,

I just got my hands on RDR audio files, most of them are .awc. I searched the Internet and didn't find much. Any way to convert that into readable format please?

Thanks!

Thank you for responding!

I got the audio files from the Xbox 360.
Yesterday, I already uploaded all audio files from the game on Google Drive, here they all are. There were also .dat files that came with it, dunno if they'll do anything tough.

Thanks again.

vgmstream supports .awc: [https://hcs64.com/vgmstream.html](https://hcs64.com/vgmstream.html)

Thanks a lot! 

But there is only one more problem.

I use this to select the streams:

```
test -s (number) -o 01.wav marston01.awc
```


I am only getting one audio file out of the .awc. I should be getting like 200.

```
metadata for marston01.awc
sample rate: 24017 Hz
channels: 1
stream total samples: 45568 (0:01.897 seconds)
encoding: Xbox Media Audio 2
layout: flat
metadata from: Rockstar AWC header
bitrate: 51 kbps
stream count: 198
stream index: 1
```



I was thinking using something like this, but I dunno really know how to implement it. 

```
test -s [0-198] -o 001.wav marston01.awc
```


So how do I select and export all the streams out of the .awc?

Thanks again.

test.exe only writes one file, so you'd need to call it once per subsong. A bit rudimentary but you can save this in a awc_extractor.bat:

```
set MAX=%2

for /L %%A in (1,1,%MAX%) do (
  test.exe -s %%A -o %FILE%_%%A.wav %FILE%
)
```

then in the command line: 
```
awc_extractor.bat marston01.awc 200
```


However, if you get the foobar or winamp plugins they'll automatically unpack all 200 subsongs to the playlist, then convert to .wav using their wav writer options, which I think is a lot more usable.

(also note, vgmstream has some audio glitches when decoding .awc from Xbox 360 at the moment, but I don't think it happend with .awc from the PS3 version).

Thank you very much, bnnm.

I used the Foobar method instead and it all worked out fine for me. The sounds are appealing and I love 'em.
No more problems, this case is closed.

Thanks again!
