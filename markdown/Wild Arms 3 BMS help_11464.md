- Post Title: Wild Arms 3 BMS help?

Hello to all who come across. Just recently, I came across some .bin files inside BTLDMEP.BIN and STGEVTP.BIN. I also noticed that shortly before the first file inside, there is some sort of id string known as "MWo3". After looking at the following pics, I can definitely see a pattern.





So I got idstring down when it comes to making a script for this. However, I am still a newbie at BMS scripting, so is it possible to ask for help?

Sample File (BTLDMEP.BIN): [Here](http://www.mediafire.com/download/q20zm9kepu2kcmf/BTLDMEP.BIN)

AFAIK MWo3 files are some kind of PS2/PSP bytecode.
