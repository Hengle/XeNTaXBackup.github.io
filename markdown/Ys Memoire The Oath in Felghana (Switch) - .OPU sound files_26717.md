- Post Title: Ys Memoire: The Oath in Felghana (Switch) - .OPU sound files

I've extracted the audio files from the game and they are in a format called OPU, which I haven't been able to find much information about online. From what I understand, it's a proprietary audio format used by the game.

I would like to convert the OPU sound files from Ys Memoire to WAV, OGG, etc., and also be able to convert any other audio file to OPU so I can insert the English voice acting into that version of the game.

I'm hoping that someone on this forum might be able to point me in the right direction to find a solution. The only thing I've tried so far is FFmpeg, but it didn't work.

Thanks in advance for any assistance, and here's a sample:

If you rename the files to .opus instead of .opu, they will play in Foobar/vgmstream

Thanks, Foobar with vgstream component played the file I renamed to .lopus but not .opus. Now we just need to figure out how to re-encode new files to that .opu format.
