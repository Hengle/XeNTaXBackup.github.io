- Post Title: Need help in Albatross18 compression method

I think this game uses some kinds of RLE method to encode the files!
And I had included some files which are compressed jpg, zip and xml, hope that anyone could help me in it!

[Here is the compressed files](http://files.filefront.com/RLE+Fileszip/;11915688;/fileinfo.html) (just about 5M) 

Thank you very much!

This is not RLE, this is based on LZ, but with a very strange encoding.

EDIT: Seems like they XORed the flag byte with C8
