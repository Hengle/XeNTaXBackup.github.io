I found this game and I downloaded and extracted the client files but it uses some kind of png and or tga textures from what I can read in the exe.
There are some plain tga files in the archive but the files i have a problem with are .shp files.
looking into the exe I found 
PNG file corrupted by ASCII conversion..Not a PNG file.
and I found 
Unknown zTXt compression type %d
I have attached some sample files and the main exe.
