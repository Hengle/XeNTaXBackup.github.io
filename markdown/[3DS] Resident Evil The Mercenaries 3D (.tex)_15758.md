Hello guys!  I tried to convert some textures from this game using some noesis texture scripts for games that use the same extension (for example Resident Evil 5, Monster Hunter 3 and others) but none works   

Could anyone take a look at this samples? Any help would be great

Works with the samples above. I need more samples to finish the script, there should be more formats.

The script uses [etc1tool.exe by onepiecefreak3](https://github.com/onepiecefreak3/etc1tool/releases). Put the executable into Noesis scenes folder.

If you know a better way to handle Ericsson compression, please, tell me!
