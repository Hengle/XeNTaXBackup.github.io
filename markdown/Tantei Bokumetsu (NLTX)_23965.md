- Post Title: Tantei Bokumetsu (NLTX)

I have been having a hard time with getting the things i have found so far to work for the nltx textures. 
I tried using the quickbms script and it throws an error and fails to export, and when i try to use the Noesis script made by TheUkrainianBard 
it wont show a preview, and when exporting it throws this error. 

[DEBUG] Calculated block_height (may be incorrect): 1
WARNING: Not enough texture data for specified image type! (2097152 vs 524288)

An from every single nltx file i have by Nippon Ichi they all do the same thing when i try to use these tools. I haven't tried Liar Princess but seeing as these tools were made around the time that game had just come out and people were wanting a translation of it i would assume the nltx files were smaller or different because they were also from the Vita.

I have dumped some textures from the four main games that i have that have this texture format.
