- Post Title: GTA V .ymt file

Some of the data file are saved in .ymt file, which cannot be opened, looks like it's encrypted using RAGE resources, anyone could do some research?

Sample file: [https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/868 ... arcols.ymt](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/8683955/GTA%20related%20content/carcols.ymt)
