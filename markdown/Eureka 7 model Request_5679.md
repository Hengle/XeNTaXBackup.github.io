I'm very interested in model files from Eureka 7 PS2.
Would like this converted into a more common file format.

for what it matters, I checked out the PSP game, being it actually takes place in the same timeline as the anime series. seems the models are just normal GMO/GMI files.. accessible with MrAdults tools of course.

models are supper shitty low res scum. it be best to remodel them from scratch, the PSP models act as a nice reference. of course there are a few good fan made models that I good too already.
