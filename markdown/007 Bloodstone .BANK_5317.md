The audio is stored in bank files with some information but not enough to convert the adpcm format given here. there are two streams inside but i can't decode because its all headerless, genh i couldn't find a setting to decode this.

I can assure you. It's not headerless. It's a special format.

Yeah, of course you're right, don't listen to OrangeC... 
I've managed to extract these files with their header. Some are MP3, but most of them are the new codec by Activition also used in Blur (on PC). We should call it "Activision ADPCM" from now on. Here's the link to my topic: [viewtopic.php?f=17&t=4542&p=44802](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=17&t=4542&p=44802).

Nope, everything just fine. 
So... anyone any ideas about the codec? Strongly reminds of PS2 ADPCM...

It's technically Bizzare Creations ADPCM or something like that. It's a mutation of Sony ADPCM which explains why it looks like actual Sony ADPCM. VGMStream already supports this. We added this format to our decoders a long time ago.

Oh, that's a relief!  Can you tell me what the header has to look like so I can adjust my extractor? Because as for now I can't play the files yet.
