Hello,

I'm trying to translate this game on PS3 version but the file that contains text data is compressed/crypted. The name of file is yeti.strdb.

Does anyone know how to decrypt ? Here is link to analyse: [http://depositfiles.com/files/ka1rt0h0x](http://depositfiles.com/files/ka1rt0h0x) - Some text is visible but the rest is only codes or whatever...

Thank you

Try the tool for FEAR. I remember that in the past i was using it for the first part of the game.
