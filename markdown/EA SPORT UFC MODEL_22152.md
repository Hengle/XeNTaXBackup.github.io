I'm not harassing anyone ... this guy came to the WWE community bringing something new that's cool I defended him a lot and he treats me like I'm someone who is harassing this is not true I am a modding enthusiast who would love to learn.
Because I speak bad English he thought I was giving him orders, it's just that I translate from French to English, which gives a bad translation.

If you do not want to help me I could ask you then to teach me how to do it I could get into modding if I have to do it myself.

I ask you kindly and you block you just have a problem with me ..
