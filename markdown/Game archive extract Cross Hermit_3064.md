- Post Title: Game archive extract Cross Hermit

I am looking into this game and I am trying to translate this game into English.
I have been able to do this through a very tedious task with a hex editor but this has limitations.
If anyone can help me with the file format that would be sweet.
there are 2 file formats one that contains what appear to be uncompressed text files and one that contains some type of gfx file. I have been able to replace the gfx files with bmp files if it helps.
