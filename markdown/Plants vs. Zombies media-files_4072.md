- Post Title: Plants vs. Zombies media-files

Hi, I'm new here and I'm working with the Open Source version of Plants vs. Zombies because I love this game and I have many ideas that I want to add.
To give credit to its original artists(animator and composer); I want to use the original media files.
So basically, the game engine is open source but you still need to buy the original game and use the main.pak file.

My problem is I don't know how to read this compressed file. If it is a rar, zip, 7zip, bz2, etc. I can browse the archive.
I can create a library to read this kind of archive if someone can tell me how to do it.

I've attached my copy of main.pak for research purpose. [http://www.mediafire.com/?nyjzodzymcr](http://www.mediafire.com/?nyjzodzymcr)

Thanks.

Plants vs. Zombies uses 7½7M archive. Read that: [viewtopic.php?f=10&t=3417&hilit=7%C2%BD7M](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=3417&hilit=7%C2%BD7M) and take a look at this site: [http://aluigi.org/papers.htm#quickbms](http://aluigi.org/papers.htm#quickbms)

Thanks for the response.
I've already tried that before but I don't know how to get the key.
My knowledge on Hex-hacking is very low or a n00b in short.

Please guide me if you can.
Thanks.

That only specifies how to decrypt a 7½7M file. How do you encrypt one?

I would like to also know how to make that .pak archive.   
Although it is not necessary to make translated main.pak, because game will run with unpacked files. (But I know it would be convenient to have ".pak builder" and it's easier to distribute your translation in one file than in many.)

That way you posted works, only that the game takes a little longer to load and is difficult to distribuition after.

If you know how to compile again, please post for us.
Thanks!

What am I doing wrong?
-I created a directory (C:\Intel)
-I've put PopPak.exe and the main.pak from Plants vs. Zombies into it
-Launched cmdline
-I enter C:\Intel
-I wrote: PopPak.exe /U main.pak C:\Intel

And nothing happens. So it doesn't unpack it to the directory, but why?

Because this is only for packing, for unpacking you must use this script - [http://aluigi.org/papers/bms/7x7m.bms](http://aluigi.org/papers/bms/7x7m.bms)

Hi.  Is there really an open source version of Plants vs Zombies?  If so, where can I obtain it from.  I would really love to experiment with it.

Thanx.

- download quickbms: [http://aluigi.org/papers.htm#quickbms](http://aluigi.org/papers.htm#quickbms)
- save the script on the disk
- launch quickbms.exe
- select 7x7m.bms
- select main.pak
- go in the folder where you want to extract the files
- all the files will be extracted

anyway when you launch quickbms.exe it will guide you in these steps automatically so it's really a joke to use it

Read first page of this thread. For packing use PopCap Framework.
