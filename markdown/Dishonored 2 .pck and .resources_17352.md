- Post Title: Dishonored 2 .pck and .resources

Hey there. I'm new to the forum but not new to modding. I recently modded Prey (2017), before that I made a bunch of small mods for Starbound, which are on Steam's Workshop. I've made small mods for many other games too. It's a hobby!

If a game doesn't have a walk modifier and I find the walking is generally too fast for my liking that's the first thing I try to mod myself. Then if I find anything else I don't like I'll mod that too then usually post it somewhere in case anyone else wants it.

Dishonored 2's walk speed is way to fast. I'm going to assume stuff like walk speed and other player modifiers are in the .pck files; what do I need to unpack these? Once I've made changes do I re-pack the files or can I put them in something like a pre-cache folder so the game will use them? Or do I need to unpack the .resources files?

If someone can point me in the right direction that would be awesome. Once I've got the files unpacked I'll use a program called Locate, which is generally a lot more useful than Windows own search. Then Notepad++ to edit the files.

This is of course assuming that Dishonored 2 can actually be modded. But it's been around for a while now so I don't see why not.

To unpack .resources, you can use this QuickBMS script.

[http://hl.altervista.org/split.php?http ... nored2.bms](http://hl.altervista.org/split.php?http://aluigi.altervista.org/bms/dishonored2.bms)

Repacking however is not possible yet.

Thanks lolwatt but having unpacked all the .resources it doesn't look like there's anything serviceable in there - nothing for modifying player movement speed at least. So perhaps those are in the .pck files? I've tried various unpackers on these and they don't work (including one for Doom). Mind you I get an error when unpacking some of the .resources so I'm not sure QuickBMS is unpacking ALL the files.
