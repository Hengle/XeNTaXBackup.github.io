- Post Title: OpenGRAF now open! Check inside!

I am starting an Open Game Resource Archive Format database (OpenGRAF), in which I intend to explain any new formats I come across and back-track all the MultiEx Commander-supported formats. 

Any coders interested in building some kind of editor for their game may then find their juice stuff here. 

Freedom for all! Open Source Open World!
