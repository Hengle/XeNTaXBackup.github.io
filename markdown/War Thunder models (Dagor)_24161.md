- Post Title: War Thunder models (Dagor)

Having a trouble looking at these files that the Dagor script someone posted here extracted.
_phobj seems to be for physics and skeleton is well either the objects themselves or just the skel.
Going to include some examples here, I'm very confused because it seems like there's verts info in these files but no faces?
