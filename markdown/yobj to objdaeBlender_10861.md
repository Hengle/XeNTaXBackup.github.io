- Post Title: yobj to obj/dae/Blender

Hey all,

Playing with Wii/Dolphin emulator and WWE 12. Managed to extract a wrestler and all the specific files. Have the texture and based on research it seems the mesh/3d model is the .yobj file. Spent a few hours researching ways/tools for converting/exporting the yobj to obj. Seems there is a 3DS Max script and a few RRxxxxxx.exe tools that seem to work only with rumble rose. Does anyone have any tools to convert yobj to obj or even .dae? Any working links appreciated. I know enough about Max to be dangerous but rather use Blender.

Thanks - jamz

I don't know, but you can try to import the mesh with this max script and export it as whatever you want:

Thanks for the nfo/link. I saw that but was not in the mood to install Max again. I did try Ninja Ripper and used  Noesis  and a Ninja Ripper plugin for .rip files but got some weird stretched looking mesh objects in Blender.
