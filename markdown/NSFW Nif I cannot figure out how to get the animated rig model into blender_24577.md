- Post Title: NSFW Nif I cannot figure out how to get the animated rig/ model into blender

Hi all

I hope to get some assistance from you fine people.

I have this series of NSFW horse and troll animations and would very much like to get this into blender

Please Note: NSFW file... If your offended or if this is going against forum policy I apologise.

[https://anonfiles.com/1fo2T7Lcu7/NSFW-Horse_nif](https://anonfiles.com/1fo2T7Lcu7/NSFW-Horse_nif)

The file attached is a nif and pressing play it is animated..
It's pretty naughty.. allows to add a 3rd character in between I guess hahaha

I have tried with 2.79 old version blender and just a rig shows up, no animation.
The latest nifimporter for 2.8/2.9 blender doesn't like the nif at all

Can any of you guys work out what's going on with this file?

Many thanks
Shaun
