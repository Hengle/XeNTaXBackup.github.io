- Post Title: PS4 -  Swizzled and Virtualized (PRT) Textures

Hello again!

after some research in ps4 game files I checked that there are some games that use DXT1 - DXT5 swizzled textures. ( Killzone, PS Playroom and others)

This swizzle method looks similar to PSvita but with some artifacts



here are some samples from Killzone Shadow Fall.
the dds header in files is not original, was added by me only for preview the textures.

maybe someone can figure out this.

thanks!

that is how looks a texture if I use the Vita unswizzling tools but all files are virtualized.

the virtualization method used here is called PRT (Partially Resident textures)
