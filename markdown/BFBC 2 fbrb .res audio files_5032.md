- Post Title: BFBC: 2 fbrb .res audio files

Ive properly extracted a ton of .res files from the PC version of battlefield bad company 2, and im having problems finding out how to get the .res files into audacity or vlc. has this part even been figured out? ive tried searching, but they turned up results for textures and other things that weren't audio.
