Depends  entirely on how you want it to look. 
Firstly you will need to extract the game models and textures ( as a side note MK9 is an unreal based game and all unreal games can be extracted using Umodel from gildors site)
Now this is where the " depends on how you want it to look" comes into play.   If you just want to change the textures to have your face on them, then you only have to load the texture into photoshop or some other art program, and add the picture of your face on to the texture for the characters face. 
If you actually want to change the shape of the head so its more like your head, then you will need to load the model into a 3d program like 3dsmax, maya, lightwave. Then edit the shape of the head, add the new texture and save it. If you want really high quality head models then you will need to get a program specifically for doing that sort of thing, such as " facegen modeler "
Then once you have your texture and/or your new model, you need to recompile all the files back into the game.

Thats the short version of what is needed.  but you will need to go look up what apps you need to extract those games ( most of that info can be found on this forum)  and most importantly if its even possible to recompile the game to run on ps3
