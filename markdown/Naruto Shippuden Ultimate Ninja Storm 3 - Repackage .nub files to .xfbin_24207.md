- Post Title: Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 3 - Repackage .nub files to .xfbin

So I'm trying to edit the sound of Ultimate Ninja Storm 3 (the process is probably the same for Revolution and many other games by Bandai/CC2). The process is different from Storm 4 (which uses nus3banks instead of nubs). 

So I extracted the sound files with nar_nub: [viewtopic.php?t=12842](https://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?t=12842)
And then I decrypted the nub files with NUBEx ([https://archive.org/details/NUBExt_R12beta](https://archive.org/details/NUBExt_R12beta)). And then I converted the BNSF files to wav files with VGSC.

That's all fine and dandy, but when I'm done editing the 80 or so wav files, how do I package them all the way back into xfbin format? Or am I doing it wrong?
