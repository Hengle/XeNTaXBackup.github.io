was wondering if you might take a look at these two games... i all i care about is file extraction (textures mainly some models wouldn't be bad either)

If I can dig up these games, I will take a look. What is KOTOR? Knights of the Old Republic?

Correct - kotor is knights of the old republic... i assumed that was rather standard for it...

Both are newish releases and neither seems to have a big mod community because everything is buried in unaccessible files...

The best site about the Legacy of Kain serie I know is : [Legacy of Kain: The Lost Worlds](http://www.thelostworlds.net/). There is some tools to extract datas. And lots of useful other infos.

EDIT : * watching at the post dates * Woops. Sorry.
