Hello.
Does anyone know if is there, tool that allows unpack VOICES2.BLK, edit sound files, or even replace of my own ones, and then pack file back together,  so i can replace it on cd image of game, and have my own sounds in the game. Thanks and im sorry for asking dumb questions, and yes i know they are extractors i have one, but it just extracts nothing more so i can't mod sounds in game. I also tried this [viewtopic.php?t=2059](https://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?t=2059) but i don't think this support this, and i dunno about this kind of stuff.  You can get file from here so you can check it out [https://mega.nz/file/mRp1zIQC#_eud1Eq96 ... IIj27gZH_o](https://mega.nz/file/mRp1zIQC#_eud1Eq96F8r6p23JFaQAKGFbadrbaTKFIIj27gZH_o)

How did you extract those SBK files?
