- Post Title: Lapis ReLiGHTS encrypted unity .bdl files with hashes

There's this game that came out last month and i'm unable to access these files in either AssetRipper or AssetStudio...
(P.S this game hates running on android emulators except real phones)
It has weird xor encryption and almost 20% of them were decrypted by aluigi's script from zenhax while the rest werent...  
(they also have .hash files besides them)

Sample files
[https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/ ... imCcF-7UiF](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ozD8mG86hMvXSCMeHWqVv-imCcF-7UiF)

These ones were almost the only ones working compared to the bdl files besides them

aaaannd these were the scripts that i had tried to use to decrypt but no luck.....

Thanks in advance.
