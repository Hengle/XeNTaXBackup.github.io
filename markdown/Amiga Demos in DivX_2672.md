- Post Title: Amiga Demos in DivX

Those of you that remember the Commodore Amiga days, may also have seen lots of cool demo's. These two are on my all-time favourites list. 

The track in this demo just raves on and on!
Jezus On E's (1992, LSD)

The sound is just excellent. I hope he can get round to upload more of them.

Starstruck from The Black Lotus apparently won the Assembly demo competition last year (2006). That's quite something, to win from PC demos. (Or the PC demo scene is getting sucky  ).
