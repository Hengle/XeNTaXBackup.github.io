- Post Title: Help extracting newer League of Legends .fsb file.

So in the past I could use fsbext to extract the LOL fsb and give them headers. I can't do that anymore. From what I've read that was 'fixed' months ago not too long after I stopped playing for awhile. Now I want to get the latest files, but have hit a roadblock. Has anyone had success with this? I've tried fsbext and FsbExtractor by Aezay.

Any help that can be given is much appreciated!

Edit: I'm running it through guessfsb 0.3, but it looks like that is going to take a very very very long time. At time of writing it's at 420 streams and has been going for around an hour.

As a general rule, if guessfsb doesn't find something immediately it isn't going to find anything.

Since guessfsb won't work can someone can link me information on how to do it manually? I'll research it and do it myself. Alternatively I can upload the file somewhere and let you guys look at it, but then I don't learn anything.
