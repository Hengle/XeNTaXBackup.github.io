- Post Title: Help With Extracting Eyes Of Heaven Stages

I've got Noesis, except 90% of the models can't be previewed nor exported. I've got the cpk unpack for the xfbin files, however i get a message saying that cygwin is too old. No clue how to replace it with a newer version. Does anyone have the stages or can someone help me>
