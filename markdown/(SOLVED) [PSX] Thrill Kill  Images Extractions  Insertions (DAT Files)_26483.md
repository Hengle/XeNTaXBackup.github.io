- Post Title: (SOLVED) [PSX] Thrill Kill : Images Extractions / Insertions (DAT Files)

Hello, hope everyone here feel good !

I just subscribe here for ask you a favor, an help about extraction/insertion of graphics compressed in .DAT format. I'm sure about what i say because i have read about it, and also try to replace an original .DAT file from an English ISO with a Russian translated one (by Vector) (MAINMENU.DAT). I just don't have the knowledge to extract, edit and reinsert back into the .DAT.

I have found lot of texts into other .DAT file, who not contain images in it as i know, the texts is visible in hexadecimal editor and can be edited, with pointers too. So for that part i'm ok !! 

Can someone help me to find a tool, or create a script for edit the contents of that archives please ??

Here is a link with all theses files...

Link removed (UPDATE)

Note : I most forgot to say we also have couple of .PSX "Sprites/Images" ? It's include because i don't really know what to do with theses files too...

Many thanks in andvance for who take time to read, reply and help me about this fan translation project !!

EDIT : All the XXX_PRAC.DAT contain the texts i have mentioned.

@Rabatini, i forgot to say "please", i'm sorry...

I work on options.dat right now, everything work wll with the tool you have suggest to me, thank!

So, can you give me the pallet's for other files, please again...  

Most important one is generic.dat for the missing texts. 
But i'm currious about the others files too (for the screens i have talk about)

If you can give me all the pallet's it can be really usefull!
I dont know how you find them, can you explain me that if is not too complicated?

I have (you have give me): options.dat & mainmenu.dat.

I still need: generic.dat

and... vs.dat, title.dat, kludge.dat & charac.dat.

Only the pallet's, i understand how the tool work in other way now...

And like i say, if you can explain me how to find them, maybe i gonna translate other game too containing .dat files (Bloody Roar).

Many thank in advance, and sorry to borred you with all my resquests/questions.

No, i can have the same result as you but it's wrong palette. I need to see the black outline around the texte, and you palette you tell me to use is black on black, i can't edit what i dont see... the picture i have shown you is for you see the ouline in question, wich white in this case... the texte need to be white/grey, so that is correct but we dont see the ouline... i can't edit if i dont see it...

Also this palette have red pixel on the text about memory card...

The pallet is correct, but its is almost all black, so trick the eyes.
the black is r:0 g:0 b:0 that one is r:8 g:8 b:8
Do a large zoom on it and you will see it.

It will not working with all file, some files uses differents cluts.

If i have to search and give you every clut of your file this topic will be 666 messages.

I will do a little tutorial for begginers, using a friend tool and $nopsx emulator.

Programs need:
NOPSX EMULATOR - LAST VERSION
psxClutW By denim (attached in this message)
Mummggtool or any graphics tools that let you use custom pallets like tile molester.

First open $nopsx emulator and go to the setup/files

change SAV/SNA file format to none
image below

I will use your game for example, but you can do this with all psx games.
Doing this you have to open the game and go to the image you want to extract the cluts

then save the file.
file - write snapshot, it will save a file as .SNA

Now go to these options

In nopsx choose WINDOW - VRAM/GPU VIEWER
the in window go line by line searching your image you want extract the clut.

[](https://imgbly.com/ib/ZPpbM34zLI)

as you can see the image has 240wx12h
And the second marked number 7871 is where the clut is locate in the vram/sna file

now open the psxClutW.exe
Drag the .sna file to the tool and write 7871 and them enter 2x
it will generate 2 files
paleta.bin and paleta.pal
you can use paleta.bin in mummggtool or tilemolester to use clut

like the image below.

I will not provide anything.
The tuto is there, the tool as well.
If you are assuming that the tool has some malicious virus, just don´t download and dont translate.

Abrazzo.
