- Post Title: Custom SWF format

Hi,

I'm trying to analyse the .xsf files out of RDR but they appear to be some sort of custom flash format that I'm not having much luck deciphering. 

This is a decompressed version of one of them, any help would be appreciated!

All I know currently is that the header is big endian, pointers begin with 0x50 and the filename can be found following the pointer at 0x168.
