Had little time.
But i looked through the file for about 10 minutes and i cudnt figure out how tog et anytihng from it.
I also scanned it with my own ripper and even with Jeader but i got nothing from it.
Mayeb STUNS might be able to get something from it.
Il look soon as i can, but like me everyone else here has been busy.
I got uni 5 days a week and weekedn = getting wasted with mates.

Sorry il see if STUNS throws out anything.
But im nto as good at this as people such as Strobe and Mr Mouse.
