- Post Title: old ubisoft adpcm format convert help.

So i ripped these files off of the 360 version of graw advanced warfighter 2 and noticed decubisnd does not decode these properly. Since its an lder verson of the format it migt be because it chokes up due to it being incompatible or some other error. I also tried VAGS prince of persia Sb0 decoder but it doesn't work. Strange.
