- Post Title: Tenerezza (Xbox) PAK Archive/Compression Format?

Hello!
I've been interested in figuring out how to fan translate Tenerezza on the original Xbox. One of the only action JRPGs on the system. 

After exploring the game's files I found out that all of its translatable materiel is stored in a file archive/compression with en extension of ".PAK". Here is a image showing all of the files that the game uses...


I'm hoping someone here can help figure out this games archive format to help aide in translation development.
Here is an example file for the script "SCRIPT.PAK"

I don't want to host any other files over fear of copyright issues. However if someone wishes to see them then I will definitely send them over PM.

Awesome, thank you! 
However, does this only extract, not insert?
