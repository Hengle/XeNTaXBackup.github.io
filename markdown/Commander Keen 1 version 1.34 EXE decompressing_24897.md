- Post Title: Commander Keen 1 version 1.34: EXE decompressing

Greetings!

Well, I have a little problem, so maybe you can help me.
So, since version 1.31 is the only moddable version of Keen 1, I tried to mod the latest v1.34. The EXE of this version anyway was compressed with PKLite that I successfully unpacked with UNP. However, there's a little problem:
While KeenGraph (a Keen graphic editor developed by Levellass) works with v1.31 (EXE compressed with LZEXE), with v1.34 it doesn't work. Whenever I try to extract the graphics from 1.34, KeenGraph mentions

'EGASPRIT.CK1 LZW-compressed, decompressing...' 
'EGALATCH.CK1 LZW-compressed, decompressing...'

And then nothing happens, but just hanging. I closed KeenGraph and checked what happened in the graphics directory (my folder for the extracted graphics). I found gibberish (probably compressed) 2 bmp files.

Help me, please! How to extract graphics? How to decompress, so that I can use KeenGraph? Since I asked people on Public Commander Keen Forum, even somebody else on ModdingWiki, but no result.
