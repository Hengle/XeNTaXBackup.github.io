Yo anyone had a chance to look at this format?

Using NFSHPExplorer you are able to open these files up however everything is corrupted and nothing will extract

Seems you didn't read the rules. That's not the correct way to describe a problem that needs help from XeNTaX. You could at least provide some legal example files, or offer others that had interest in this to have direct access to those files (Maybe via Remote Control or PM the files). This way, you're not gonna get any replies except for this kind of reply that tells you to Read The Rules. Try reading the rules first. I'm aiming to get car models out of this game too. Especially that Aventador since The RUN...

Oh... Well, aside from the rules thingy... I'm glad someone took an interest in this one. NFS File Format cracking has stopped since SHIFT 2... Hope this one's a sucess.

Don't bother with it.
It's useless since NFSMW2 has almost all the cars in previous NFS games.
Some are new but they are also in Forza and NFS The Run cannot be cracked because of Frostbite 2 engine.

The Run is indeed using Frostbite 2 but this game here is using Chameleon 4 or what it was named from Burnout Paradise since Criterion used their own game engine, same with Hot Pursuit I believe. 
(Albeit here it's updated with DX11 enhancements and probably other stuff, I doubt one could just use a unpacker from those earlier titles for the file format as it's probably undergone some changes as well.)

I'm definitely interested. The way I see it, if NFSHPExplorer can open and 'hack' at the files, then perhaps all is needed is a little change or two in the source code? I'm new to this extracting thing as far as coding goes, but have got pretty good at ripping and converting

Does anyone have any bundle files from NFSHP of the vehicles? I'd like to see how it steps through those and compare to MW.

Any progress towards .BNDL unpacking?

I am eagerly waiting for this, because NFS Run was impossible to extract, but if Most Wanted 2012 can be extracted, it would be awesome

Someone might wanna go speak to oleg about this. Zmodeler used to handle all the NFS games and if this one looks like it might be a similar format to another then he might be interested in checking it out.

Also, hi SoniKalien

I wrote this to extract textures from bundle files.
I attach it here in case anyone needs it.
usage : Drag *.BNDL files into the exe and it will extract textures into a folder with a same name as BNDL.

All files bodies and headers are stored separately in BNDLs.
I could parse texture headers but I don't know much about modeling.
But I can extract models bodies and headers if I'm not wrong.
Here is an example.If anyone can make sense tell me and I will make tool.

My best bet to get models out would have to be using ninja ripper since I don't think anyones working on tools.

Though ripping can be problematic.

I figured out how to export from zmod since it's really a piece of shit tool and yeah so far here is one of the cars.

See if you guys can help texture it or somethng. Since zmodel's obj export with the textures crash max

Here are the textures for this car

Did you actually bought zmod3, then exported the car as .obj?
So far, my try with ninja ripper regarding ripping from mw didnt succeed at all. But it does work for the run though.

Okay then. Guess i'll try texturing that vantage later on. And since imo, you wont take model export request, then someone surely needs to make an export tool for most wanted onstead of zmod3. :\

Had to agree. I actually had troubles texturing it. There are rips of the game on gamemodels website, but only problem is that they dont have main textures. And it seems like they depend on colors and in-game shaders instead of textures.

All files bodies and headers are stored separately in BNDLs.
I could parse texture headers but I don't know much about modeling.
But I can extract models bodies and headers if I'm not wrong.
Here is an example.If anyone can make sense tell me and I will make tool.

Simply... You can't. Fonts are textures not a ttf. Use offzip and raw texture cooker. Have no idea how to pack it back. There is for sure offset and comp/decomp size flags.

Someone just posted on zenhax tool for texts if you are interested.

I have succesfully extracted BNDL files with Noesis and a plugin, but now I am left with .dat files.... any clue as to how to convert that to mp3 or wav or at least is there a program which can correctly play .dat files? I am trying to extract the Engine sounds from MW so I can use that to make sound mods for other games.

It is not entirely clear what that guys answer is doing really.... I removed the first 4 bits of the header like he said in the corresponding files and then gave it the .gin extension (or I am doing something totally wrong), but all i get is a loud noise in audacity, and if you listen very very very closely you might just make out an engine sound under that noise. Now I am a total noob with all of this and been looking for a solution for days now as I have yet to find someone who claims he succesfully extracted the engine audio files from Most Wanted 2012. Specifically do I want that engine recording of the Aston Martin DBS, as the sound is near damn perfect and accurate.

Any further help and feedback would be hugely appreciated. If you need anything from me just let me know.

I only realise now it was your answer and not someone else (lol). So how do I do this exactly? Because as far as I know the engine sounds are not located in the sounds folder but thus located in the _low.bndl files right? And after unpacking you get numerous folders all with different numbers, and the folder with the 80 at the start has the engine sounds in it as you mentioned. In there are .dat files, and if I understood correctly, with a Hex Editor I delete the first 4 bytes, and then save with a .gin (so change .dat to .gin) extension? Because I did this and and made sure foobar2000 has the vgmstream component, but it still says it is an unsupported format... I am doing something wrong and i do not know what it is.

Little update, I got it to play now, bc the MW files have more than 4 bytes before gnsu starts in hex, only problem is that you only hear a loud crackling noise when playing the files. I also tried it with Hot Pursuit, and there it worked flawlessly, so somehow the most wanted files are a bit different

Indeed for MW2012 for GIN engine sounds you need to cut first 8bytes, the header starts with Gnsu30, while the SPS are still 128bytes.
Just sent a sample to one of the vgmstream devs, hoping we might see in a few weeks an update to be supported.

Hey, I was looking at the solution to extract those engine sounds myself. I managed to remove the crackling noise. Literally registered to send a reply, because thought this might be helpful.
First of all, I extracted the _HI version of .bndl file from VEHICLES. The sounds, as you know, are located in 80_00_00_00 folder. Removing 8 first bytes will make a Gnsu30 header, but we need to convert it to Gnsu20. It's pretty easy.
If you're using Hex Workshop, navigate to text and replace 3 with 2, so it the text will be Gnsu20 now.
Navigate to offset 32 (if you didn't remove first 8 bytes from the .dat file, it's offset 40), and remove 4 bytes containing zeros.
Then navigate to offset 236 (if you didn't remove first 8 bytes from the .dat file, it's offset 244). And replace 01 with 00.
And now it can be opened by foobar2000 vgmstream combo.

I've tried to follow your guide but i need some more detail since i've never used an hex editor before, first of all, how do i remove the first 8 bytes form the .dat file?
Secondly, using Hex Workshop, i couldn't find any 01 in offset 244, but i did change Gnsu30 into Gnsu20 and the same for the 4 bytes located in offset 40.
Last thing, is it possible to do the same with police chatters' voicelines? it's been years since im trying to get those!

Ok,  so, SPEECHEVENTSEQUENCES.SWC0 is where you'll get all cop speeches.
When you look for the the header 4800000C of each SPS segment/part how ever you want to call it, you'll find how many it holds, in this case a total of 7674 and they all end with a bunch of 656565656565 hex values.
There for in vgmtoolbox all you need to do is:

when you have correct options marked in red above just drag and drop the archive at the top where it tells you to drag and drop files to search here.
After that you'll get them all like this:

Then associate them to play/convert with the foobar2000/vgmstream combo.
there you go


have fun

I've tried to follow your guide but i need some more detail since i've never used an hex editor before, first of all, how do i remove the first 8 bytes form the .dat file?
Secondly, using Hex Workshop, i couldn't find any 01 in offset 244, but i did change Gnsu30 into Gnsu20 and the same for the 4 bytes located in offset 40.
Last thing, is it possible to do the same with police chatters' voicelines? it's been years since im trying to get those!

If you highlight first 8 bytes and press backspace, they will be deleted. 1 byte is 2 "letters" (examples: 00, EE, 1E, etc.). You probably could not find the 01 at 236 / 244, because you didn't select "View offsets in decimal" (the glasses with 10 on top).

After all of this I can finally extract audio and car models from the game. And that's fun and all, but is there a way I could extract code from the game, and even mod the game?

Hello everyone.
I wish to get under the hood of pursuit system of NFS MW'12 and make a mod of it. I managed to find out that the pursuit data is located in raw\1_block\21_Script-\390428_b.dat inside the GAMEPLAY. BNDL.
So how do i convert that .dat into something editable and back?

I've tried asking this guy

[https://steamcommunity.com/id/NIVSAYZ](https://steamcommunity.com/id/NIVSAYZ)

an author of a pursuit system mod, as for now without an answer.
