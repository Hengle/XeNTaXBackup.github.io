- Post Title: Renaming Control Audio Files.

Hi , 
been playing around with Control 2019 game . 
managed t extract the audio files along with the soundbanksinfo.xml + name text file
the problem is that there's so many audio files that use 32bit name and it's messy as hell can someone write a script that rename the wem ID using soundbanks and the text names ? 

here the files :
