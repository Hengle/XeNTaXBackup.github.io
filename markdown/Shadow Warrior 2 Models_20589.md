- Post Title: Shadow Warrior 2 Models

Hello,

I would like to extract some models from Shadow Warrior 2.
So far I was able to extract the contents of the .bin containers in the main directory.
Now I have a bunch of .htk/.mopp/.rhm files. 
My first guess is, that the .hkt files have something to do with the Havok engine, but I wasn't able to open these.
The .rhm files could be mesh files, but i haven't found any information about them yet.

Maybe some of you have already extracted some Shadow Warrior 2 models.
Any help is appreciated.

Have you tried to use Havok content tool to open te htk files?

I tried to open the htk files with Havok content tool 2014, but i just got an error message stating the file format is unknown
and the Preview Tool doesn't start up at all, it just crashes.

Ok, so apparently I needed the 32 bit version of Havok, now I can open the .hkt files.
The problem is, i want the non-rigged models of the game (and they only come as .rhm files not .hkt)

(and thanks for the quick response)

thats maybe a dirty way to do it, but you can rip those models and textures via NinjaRipper.

How did you extract the contents of the .bin files?

EDIT: Nevermind, I got it. Now to figure out some way to properly export .hkt files...

Messed around for a while, seems there's no real way to do it without a specialised model converter. So if anyone would be willing to whip up one for this game's .hkt files, would greatly appreciate it! Can provide sample files if needed

Any news on this? Been trying to extract game models from shadow warrior 2 for the past 2 years and no luck. Only managed  to extract assets from bin files and convert all textures from dds into png.  Tried using havok tools for models but no luck at all

for the past 2 years

If you want the rigging/skeleton included then it's not possible neither are almost all the weapons or any static model, but as has been mentioned you can get the main skeletal models & textures if you're willing to do your own rigging after.
