- Post Title: streetfighter character models?

I have been trying to somehow access the character models in streetfigher ex 3 for ps2. I put the disc in my laptop an noticed there are a dozen or so files. Some files are irx files and a huge .dat file named ps2 is 576 mb. I have been trying to do this for yeras now and finally discovered this forum. I just want to be able to access the character models/databse. A friend of mine said this is possible but I have lost touch with him please could someone help me figure out how to do this thanks!!!!!!!!!!!!!
