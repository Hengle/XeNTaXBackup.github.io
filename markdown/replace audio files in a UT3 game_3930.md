- Post Title: replace audio files in a UT3 game

hi,
is there a way to replace audio files in a UT3 game?
thanks to Gildor's extractor i can extract the audio files (SoundNodeWave), but i'm willing to alter them like dubbing in a new language, then replacing them in the game... is that possible? and if true, how?
