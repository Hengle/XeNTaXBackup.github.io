- Post Title: Bc7 and bc5 decompression and compression

So i've just started modding and was able to tweak some textures etc... But i can't make changes to bc5 and bc7 (which i assume to be normal maps). When i open them in photoshop, they appear to be corrupted or damaged (visually damaged). Do i need a tool to decompress them, i've already downloaded two tools but i can't find a tutorial online. Can someone provide help for this?
