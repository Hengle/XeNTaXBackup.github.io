- Post Title: UMvC3 PC *.mod Format

Another MT Framework game from Capcom, with yet another revision to their MOD format.
Current extractors\importers ( such as [FluffyQuack's](http://residentevilmodding.boards.net/thread/660/3ds-model-import-export-script) ) that I'm aware of don't seem to do the job, sadly.
Would be neat to start modding this game, there's certainly a large enough community full of artists just dying to dive into this, so any info at all would be appreciated.

Below I included a sample file, hopefully someone here will have an idea of what's changed from previous revisions.
