- Post Title: Way of the Samurai 2

Hi there,

I'm trying to make a language patch for the Ps2 version of Samurai dou 2 Kettouban (Way of the Samurai 2 Special edition).
I've managed to extract the contents of the VOLUME.DAT, using Gnie's Xpert 2, and the 
shinobido volume.dat plugin (If there's a more appropriate plugin, let me know)

But, I'm unable to repack it. I've not even tried editing the file yet. I've just unpacked it, then
repacked it. Just to see if it works. Unfortunately it doesn't. When I repack it, it seems to gain
30-40mb, and the game crashes when I run it (running it in Pcsx 2 1.2.1).
I'm assuming it's crashing because of the additional 30-40mb of data, changing the addresses,
causing the pointers to no longer point at the right address.

This is the error I get 



Here's the VOLUME.DAT

And here's the Shinobido volume.dat plugin I'm using with it.
