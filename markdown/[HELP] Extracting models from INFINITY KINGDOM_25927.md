- Post Title: [HELP] Extracting models from INFINITY KINGDOM

Hi everyone reading this post, recently i wanted to extract the models from a mobile game i used to play called "Infinity Kingdom". But upon opening the .obb archive file, i realized that the content files has been encrypted, already use AssestStudio and only show generic mesh 

If anyone know another method to descrypted those models let me know.

Thank for advance
