- Post Title: Dragon Quest The Adventure of Dai: A Hero's Bonds

The Dragon Quest AoD:AHB came out a couple of days ago, and I wanted to try to rip the contents of the game, the game was developed by DeNA the same people who worked on Pokemon Masters EX, I don't know if that will make it easier to get its files or if the formats of the models will be the same.
