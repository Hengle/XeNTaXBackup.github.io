Game's been released, but it apparently doesn't work with NOX. Can someone with a rooted phone (or Bluestacks) try to get the game's data so we can check the 3D model files?

Data extracting method

I prepare

・BlueStacks
・BSTweaker

・ I install this application in BlueStacks

・I download live data with a choice of 3D mode
Because the early days have few clothes, I can obtain more models by doing a live together.

・I open BSTweaker in the state that founded BlueStacks
You click Root, and please choose lower Patch

・ I click File Manager and go to the place of /storage/emulated/0/Android/data/jp.co.happyelements.boysm.

・ I choose files and click F5 Copy
As for the model motion, UnityCache, the music enter Data.

Hey! I would need some help with the files, if you would not mind? I downloaded the .zip file with all the extracted files however, they all are for me just as ".file" format & I can't access models, textures nor anything else as I don't know their actual formats or what to do with them to be able to use them

Use Asset Studio to extract the file.

Hello! Does anyone else here have a clue about how to extract models(outfits) which I don't have? because the method above seems to need the player to own the outfit in the first place so the client can download the data. Thanks!

Is there any updated info on the state of Ensemble Stars for PC? As far as my understanding goes, they implemented a patch that prevents the game from being played with emulators. Are there any known workarounds or does anyone have a backup of resources downloaded prior to the patch? I believe it was done a pretty good long while ago, but of course only just now am I looking for the little sprites from the Work section of the game...

* UPDATE *

It took a little digging, but I was able to find this resource for anyone just looking for EnStars assets: [https://wondergame.carrd.co/#assetdrives](https://wondergame.carrd.co/#assetdrives)

I have a data dump from JP of alot of the files and me and some friends have been slowly working through. However, not all costumes are available as the game only installs the files onto your device as needed. I can share it here: [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vrb54f ... sp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vrb54fxZOI4-4VqY0NlzTyFG_e8RO_vV/view?usp=sharing)

Note the files can only be decrypted with AssetStudioGUI. At least most of them.

Right now I'm more focused on extracting audio/motion data but if anyone would like to help compiling assets that would be appreciated.

Not really assets, but this guy cracked the code somehow.
[https://ko-fi.com/idolripperlover187908](https://ko-fi.com/idolripperlover187908)

I'm not sure how he did it, bro is a wizard crackin' into Fort Knox, but if you need a one-off commission then I can vouch, he's legit.

Otherwise, I've been searching for months and 3D Enstars rips are a barren wasteland. I tried Ninjaripper myself, but the game kept crashing so I think anti-cheats are at play. Or my computer sucks lmao, could be either, but for once I think it's the anti-cheats. This thread was the closest I could find to rips, but I was pretty bummed to see all the dead links. Hopefully we can make progress, I'm glad to see people posting here!!

But, I do not know how to use AssetStugioGui.
I would be very happy if you could tell me.

Download the file I linked in Google Drive then download Asset Studio GUI: [https://github.com/Perfare/AssetStudio](https://github.com/Perfare/AssetStudio)

Once downloaded open the program and click "file" then "load folder" and select the downloaded folder (make sure to have it extracted from the zip)
It'll look like this: [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fPz9g_ ... sp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fPz9g_DUQxGN_ZoNjEZ2uLwI8y3LgCBw/view?usp=sharing)

Then the program will begin decrypting the files. Give it time.

Once it's finished use asset list to look around and try to find what you're looking for. Good luck.

Thank you so much for this. I've been using NR for this game and it's fine on my end, at least, but rigging them was always a pain, and there's a bunch of limitations. Using the files you provided, I was able to successfully compile an idol together, and I can probably do some more if you need it.

I decided to get the models myself because a lot of them seemed to be missing from the original folder (or I just couldn't find them lol). This should include most of the outfits up until April.

edit: Link got taken down for DM//CA violations. PM me if you need anything.

I am a beginner with this sort of stuff, but I hope it was of help. If anyone has any questions feel free to send a PM :P

Note: I use AssetStudioGUI to view the files, but other programs work too, like AssetRipper.

i'm a bit of an idiot when it comes to this forum, would you be able to pm me first?   i'm able to decrypt them by myself, but was having trouble getting them from the game - if you have the full assets that'd be great!

I rip using a jailbroken iPhone actually so I haven’t come across this issue. The app doesn't work while it's jailbroken though, and will immediately crash. If there’s a specific outfit you’re looking for I might be able to help you get it

ive figured out how to get into (some) of the engstars files (zAssets). this might work for other overseas versions, im not sure.
you need a special version of assetstudio, which you can get [here](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1134674743648338022/1136786738086412308/net6.0.zip). go down to "options" and "specify game" as ensemblestars. hope this helps!
(also if any of you have kuromi mayoi or know how to view/use the live2ds let me know...)

EDIT: i linked the wrong assetstudio before, please download the new one

Does anyone still have the downloads to the models? All the dl links seem to be down. It would be a great help!

I took down the link because someone started using the assets to make money and i hate capitalism. That and the dump was getting very large so it's difficult to host on Goggle Drive. If anyone DMs me looking for specific things I might be able to help.

Hello, I have extracted the model and dance animation, but my current problem is that the face I extracted has no dance animation. I successfully extracted the facial expressions and bones, but there is no animation when I play it. How do you guys solve it?  Please let me know if you find a solution, thank you
