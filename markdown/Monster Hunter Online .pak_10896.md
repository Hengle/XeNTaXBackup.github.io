Hey,

would be great if somebody could help me with these .pak-files. The game is based on CryEngine 3 but from what I can see they are encrypted and thus need a key. No idea on how to find it, here are two example files.

Client Downloader: [http://down.qq.com/mhfc/dltools/MHO_Set ... signed.exe](http://down.qq.com/mhfc/dltools/MHO_Setup_1.2.1_XFDL_signed.exe)

Thank you very much!
