I am looking for some help to uncompress these files, they are graphic content from a very popular iOS game. I have uploaded the entire data folder as a sample.
Opening the file with a hex editor gives me LZMA default properties so I guess its some kind of simple archive maybe with their own modifications. Anyone have any ideas?
