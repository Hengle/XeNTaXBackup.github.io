Just out of curiosity i started hexing those files =D

the DT3 file seems to be containing ingame scripts, possibly
files that has game configurations, etc . no sound or graphic could be
found here.

The FSB contains some Modified RIFF header ,
these files would not be playable anyway if just stripped out of the
archive, but there seems to be enough similarities in this format
with a standard WAVE file, so i think a converter should not be
very hard to write. once the archive is fully extracted.
