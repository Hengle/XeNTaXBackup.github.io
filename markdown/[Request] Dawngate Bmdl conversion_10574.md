- Post Title: [Request] Dawngate Bmdl conversion

Hey guys i have looked all over the internet trying to figure out how to convert these files into usable obj/fbx files to work on in 3ds max. However i cannot for the life of me figure out a way to convert them. There seems to be no real information about bmdls on the internet. (possible that the bmdls within the directory are not really bmdl's or they are only readable by the Dawngate.exe/engine. 

I joined this site specifically to look for the answer, and im hoping you guys might be able to at least push me in the right direction. 

chrrox did an awesome job opening up the .snap files within the dawngate directory. i just need to get these bmdl's open or converted. Any information is greatly appreciated and i might even be able to compensate.
