- Post Title: Witcher 3 XBM Texture

Hi,
So I am trying to create some tool which would involve working with the textures of Witcher 3 but since the official modkit is extremely slow I am seeking for the help of the talented people of xentax to acomplish my goal. In theory the file is a DDS image compressed embeded into a CR2W file (these are the witcher 3 "archives")

So the problem is the unknown bytes which is the actual image. I tried hhrhhr's lua tools ([https://github.com/hhrhhr/Lua-utils-for-Witcher-3](https://github.com/hhrhhr/Lua-utils-for-Witcher-3)) which in theory would convert the image to some understandable format but they do not work reliably and properly. Any help would be apriciated with this because unless I solve this somehow I can't progress with my tool. I would even gladly pay for the person who reverses it but as I remember thats against the rules of xentax :p
Anyway thanks for reading and if you help for that too.
Cheers!
