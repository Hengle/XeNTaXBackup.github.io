- Post Title: Zoo Tycoon: ZT, Dinosaur Digs, Marine Mania

This isn't exactly a game request, so much as just filling you in on an archive that should already be supported by MexCom. For most all the necessary information, the game Zoo Tycoon (ZT) and its expansion packs, Dinosaur Digs (DD) and Marine Mania (MM) all use files with the extension .ztd. These files are, in fact, merely zipped files with the extension changed. (Just shows how cheap Bill Gates really is!   ) And when you open them, the only files that need a custom utility to be opened are those for the animations. (See? C-H-E-A-P) Therefore, you should be able to safely add Zoo Tycoon: .ztd to your Supported Games list.
