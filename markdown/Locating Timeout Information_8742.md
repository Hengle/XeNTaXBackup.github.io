So I'm new to this type of scene. I've had plenty of experience (okay, not plenty, but I'm about average) in the coding scene (Java, C++ and C#), but I've never messed with assemblies, on the fly RAM manipulation, process editing and the such. I am a bit of a computer technician, so computer terms aren't vague to me. But the majority of this is really confusing to me. So please be patient with me. XD I'm a quick learner, so it should be too much of a problem.    Anyways, on to my problem.

Monster Hunter Portable 3 for the PSP has an extremely low time out. Recently, PRO Online has been released that allows playing of this game across the internet, but due to how far everyone is usually from one another, the time out doesn't allow for enough time for data to be exchanged between two PSP's. So my goal is to decrypt the data.bin file that comes with MHP3 and locate the file dealing with the adhoc function regarding MHP3. 

I've managed to decrypt the bin file, however, I have no idea where to go from there. I've been presented with a number of folders each with files inside of them that have a different extension. The folder names relate to the extension of the files it holds within. I'll list the extensions here:

bin, dbst, gif, gim, head, mwo, pak, png, prx, tmh, uvf

From what I know, some of the bin files contain language strings, gifs are just pictures, gims are if i recall correctly, models files, png are more pictures and prx's are basically files that are ran during runtime. I'm suspecting that my goal lies somewhere in the prxs files, however, I've yet to find anything. 

Any help or a point in the right direction would greatly be appreciated as I'm basically in BFE as of now.

Would be helpful o have a sample of the data.bin. Either upload the whole file or cut out the first and last 1MB or so and upload it to a hoster so we can take a look.

Ah, my fault. :3

It's a rather large file (1 gig in size), so I'm just going to give you parts of the file like you suggested. I split the parts using a program called JR File Splitter. If that's isn't correct, let me know. :3
