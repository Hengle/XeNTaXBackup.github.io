- Post Title: Need Big Cow Help!

Hello everyone!
I am making an online game independently based on Unity3D.
He will be free, non-commercial operation, hope to bring happiness to himself and his friends!
Unfortunately, poor coders are not good at dealing with art.
Fortunately, I unpacked a set of materials.The Age of Wushu.
The problem is that the models and actions are encrypted and I can't open them with 3DMAX.
I found the unpack plugin from 4 years ago and successfully opened some files.
Missing face model, and action, I will upload.
Hope to get help!
Have a nice day!

PS: my game video

This is the encrypted face model.

Use the plugin provided in the post, can't unpack.
But you can unpack about 80% of the other models.
