- Post Title: Star Wars Battlefront II Closed Alpha

So i got into the closed alpha earlier and ever since i got it downloaded i haven't been able to get any of the python scripts to extract anything but the folders and i've tried both the SWBF and battlefield 1 scripts and that's about all i get.

The whole game is 7.25 gigs and the cat/cas files are almost all of that with 6.97gb but if anyone needs anything to modify the python scripts just let me know and i can provide what you need to get it working.

Any way you could post the entire thing? I wanted to try a few things with the .cas files and see what formats there are. I also would like to try something with the .exe file and see if I can modify any of my pre-existing scripts.

I can pm it to you i don't think it's allowed to post games like that, but i also found a program called FrostyToolSuite and works with the first game fully and is pretty awesome because it works a lot like the tool i posted up during the closed alpha of the first game.

That's one of the programs I wanted to try. Were you able to get it to work?

It errors as soon as i select it and it says Attempting to load game with no stored profile and i click ok and the program just exits unlike with Battlefront 2015 it loads it all just fine.

Huh. I'll try it out anyway, but I doubt it will work for me if it doesn't work for you.
