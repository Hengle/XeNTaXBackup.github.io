- Post Title: Reader Rabbit Preschool Movie.dll

Greetings, 

I need some help with getting a video file from Reader Rabbit Preschool's .DLL file format.

I have been able to extract .wav sound files from other .DLL format files thanks to QuickBMS with a parse_exe.bms script...
But whenever I tried it on the wanted file, it just comes out in meaningless .dat files. 
Here's my sample for examination: [https://www.dropbox.com/s/jfdjp2tzb9hrq ... e.zip?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/jfdjp2tzb9hrqnz/RRPData%20Sample.zip?dl=0)

If anyone could be able to find some type of video format type within the .DLL file (and possibly a way to extract it whole), then I will be very grateful for your help.

Thank you for your assistance.

P.S. If this topic feels like it should be in Game Archive instead of Video file formats, then I apologize.
