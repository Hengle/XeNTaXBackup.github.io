Hello!
I was wondering if someone could rip the Hyperdimesion Neptunia MK2 models for me.
I don't want any specific one; I'd just like some :>
I already have Gust and 5pb.
Please and thank you!
I am grateful for anyone to respond! c:
Oh, also, could you please include the information on the format they are in? I would prefer .obj since I can't find something that can open .DAE files.
Thanks again!

It's alright if not, but just wondering. :3I've been busy, so I haven't worked on anything yet. Green Heart, at least, will be up before the end of the week. The others may take a bit longer, as there's still that rigging problem that I have to try fixing up, first...

Well, that solves the major problem for me -- I found a LightWave script that basically sets the "missing" weights to a specified weight map, which was exactly what I was looking for. So, that means that I can start working on the rest of the characters now without worrying about some parts being improperly rigged. You'll probably know where to find them once they're up and ready.

Ah, okay.
That's good.
