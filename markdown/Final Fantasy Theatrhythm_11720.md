- Post Title: Final Fantasy Theatrhythm

Hello guys  

Today I saw some useful stuffs in the Theatrhythm game and I wonder if anyone here already managed to understand this game files structure and maybe successfully extract some resources.

Not sure if it's true but I read something about unity file format..(could be wrong    ).

Thanks for any answer!
