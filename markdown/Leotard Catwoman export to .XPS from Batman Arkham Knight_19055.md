- Post Title: Leotard Catwoman export to .XPS from Batman Arkham Knight

Hello there.

Looking to somehow move [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOtwrz2fRIQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOtwrz2fRIQ) / [https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B-t2fA ... lkdm8/view](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B-t2fAhN2YD9bGNsWmhCNTlkdm8/view) this one to .XPS with kind of "T" look model for futher edits.  Looking to do an update for this mod [https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/ ... 1526915957](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1526915957) => need .XPS to proceed.

Example for edits - [https://www.deviantart.com/sticklove/ar ... -544024034](https://www.deviantart.com/sticklove/art/Catwoman-544024034)

I'm new in this things. One guy on deviantart recommend this forum:

""Look up on xentax or other ripping related sites which formats AK uses and how to extract them, I don't know, I never bothered, practically everything has been ripped from it by now. I don't know if ninja ripper can pull stuff out of AK, someone on said forums might have tried, if it can, then you're doing something wrong. Still, ninja ripper should generally be the last resort if you can't pull the models out of the files.".

I tried [https://gamebanana.com/tools/download/5638](https://gamebanana.com/tools/download/5638), but, by some reason can't run mod + and ripper at once on my PC... Same as also need to somehow convert it after to specific format. .XPS is a few better to work with here specially.

Anybody can help me with? Any suggestions?

Upd.: Looks like [http://www.gildor.org/en/projects/umodel](http://www.gildor.org/en/projects/umodel), [https://youtu.be/nKBRBqLllj4](https://youtu.be/nKBRBqLllj4) might be useful. Can somebody help me get .3DS to .XPS by this?

AK it's an Unreal Engine game, so all you need is umodel by Gildor, it' very user friendly. And has it's own forums and AK thread there. If you don't have 3ds max, you could use Blender or even Noesis - to convert .psk (after umodel) into almost any format.
