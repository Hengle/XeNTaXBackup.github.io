- Post Title: Ripping/Opening The Walking Dead All Stars .bundle Files

Hello, I was trying to open .bundle files from the android game "The Walking Dead All Stars" in order to extract sprites/2Dmodels but i couldn't find a way to do it. Does someone know how i can do it ? (if someone already succeed and have link to download these sprites, i'm interested, instead of extracting by myself). Thanks.
