Hi,

The UAX/UTX/USX/... files are archives used by the Unreal series of games - you will be able to open them using any of the many programs out there that deal with Unreal games.


(I think) I had a look at the SS0 archive before and didn't come up with anything of any use - good luck to anyone else who can sort the format out. Alternatively I may not have even looked at the format, but I doubt it

Just to clarify, I have taken a look at all the major Splinter Cell files but havn't come across anything of any interest - excepting of course that most of the formats are from Unreal.

In other words, I don't know what any of the other files are - I don't think they are archives at all.
