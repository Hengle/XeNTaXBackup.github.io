Hi everyone! I'm new in packing/unpacking game resource files - about 2 months experience. But never the less I managed to create an UI tool, so I decided to share it with you. Everything (including the UI) is written in PHP, unusual for that type of work, but that's I know - that's I use.  Hope it will help someone and don't hesitate ask questions.

2 things:
- just if somebody registered on 4Shared, can download it
- there are icons, but no texts. Maybe you should use tooltips, to the user know, what does the button.

Wow, what a mistake - download link changed. And thanks for the tip about the icons, I'll try to think of something.

New version is now available with small optimization changes. Some new resource formats were added too. The link in the first post is updated with the new version.
