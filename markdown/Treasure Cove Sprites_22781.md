- Post Title: Treasure Cove Sprites

Hi.

I am trying to extract all the sprites and backgrounds from Treasure Cove, and I have some leads on where the sprites and backgrounds are potentially stored. Thereâ€™s either the TDL (which is presumably the precursor for the DLL format) / DLL (Version 1 uses the TDL files, and Version 2 uses the DLL files), or the DAT files. However, if I extract from the DAT files (I use QuickBMS), it extracts a load of DAT files. The TLD / DLL files, on the other hand, they show that they have Bitmap signatures in some areas, which is why they are suspect.

I am open to suggestions for how to rip the sprites and backgrounds from the game. Is there a tool that I may be missing, or is there a script that I should try out?
