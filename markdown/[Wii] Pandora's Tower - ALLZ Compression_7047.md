- Post Title: [Wii] Pandora's Tower - ALLZ Compression

[Samples](http://www.mediafire.com/?irafuyhz5uworcr)

The header for most of the files in this game start with "AL" (ALAR, ALIG, ALMT, ALOD, ALLZ), so I was wondering if maybe the last two letters mean LZSS compression, or a different version of it. If not, then is there any other way I can decompress these files?

your best bet is to run it on the emulator then dump some files from the emulator.
then you can compare the files or if your lucky you can just rip them all from there.
