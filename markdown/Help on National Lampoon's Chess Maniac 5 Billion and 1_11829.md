Hi,
I've wanted to this for ages but couldn't    
I couldn't extract nor even identify how they are packed.   

Can anyone please assist in identifying/extracting sound files from this classic game's packed file(s)?
Only sounds would suffice, not music, etc.

Many Thanks in advance!     

Here are all the data files from game dir.

Honestly I took a stab at it. it seems to me the actual audio is in the DEFAULT.3D0 file, but I can't locate any signs of audio data in it. the music is much simpler, XMidi in the sound folder. If you're really dieing to figure it out, try contacting this guy, [http://jratcliffscarab.blogspot.com/](http://jratcliffscarab.blogspot.com/) he seems to have a huge hand in something called "The Audio Solution" which was implemented in this game to support playback on many current audio cards of the time (adlib, media vision, sound blaster, etc). it might be good to read up about the tech used for the time before contacting him: [http://devtidbits.com/2008/04/26/dosbox ... emulation/](http://devtidbits.com/2008/04/26/dosbox-sound-emulation/)

Hi,
Yes, after all this time (and efforts) I couldn't figure out how to extract audio data.
I'm not dying but I really like to get this out of my head.
Thanks for the links, I'll read first then I'll drop him a note.
