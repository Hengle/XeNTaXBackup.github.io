Hi,

I need your help. I'm trying to find a 3D Gotham set, but i couldn't. And also i couldn't get any 3D content from The Dark Knight Rises (TDKR)mobile game. Can you help me and send me some map, set, models from TDKR and Batman Arkam series games.

Thanks in advance.

John

Hey mate, hate to say it but ripping maps from the Arkhamverse of Dark Knight Rises isn't possible. Best you can do is get the props. I've done a handful of props, and characters which can be downloaded at: [http://g-r.infinityfreeapp.com/](http://g-r.infinityfreeapp.com/)
