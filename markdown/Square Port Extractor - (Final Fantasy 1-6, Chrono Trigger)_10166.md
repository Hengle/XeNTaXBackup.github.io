Square Port Extractor

Tool for unpacking and repacking content of Square games on PlayStation like:

- Final Fantasy 1    a.k.a. FFI or FF I
- Final Fantasy 2    a.k.a. FFII or FF II
- Final Fantasy 3    a.k.a. FFIII or FF III
- Final Fantasy 4    a.k.a. FFIV or FF IV
- Final Fantasy 5    a.k.a. FFV or FF V
- Final Fantasy 6    a.k.a. FFVI or FF VI

This program was written to extract and compress the
compressed files of Final Fantasy VI PSX, furthermore
it also works with Final Fantasy V PSX and Chrono 
Trigger PSX. If you want to translate completely these
games this is the program for you!

For example you can extract the FF6 MENU.BIN file or
CT KOK.BIN file.
