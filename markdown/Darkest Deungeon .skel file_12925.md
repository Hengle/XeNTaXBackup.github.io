- Post Title: Darkest Deungeon ".skel" file

Can anyone possibly take a look at this file and offer help on who to open/edit the file? I've searched all over the web and there is very little information.

What i do know is the .Skel file is some sort of bones that are used for the models in the game.

The game it's self is a 2D sidescroller that uses 2D/Hand drawn models.

Here is a example.


Thanks!
