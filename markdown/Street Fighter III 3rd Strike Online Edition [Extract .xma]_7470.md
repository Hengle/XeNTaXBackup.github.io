Hi everyone,

I'm trying to extract SFIII audio files. The game file don't have any extension, the file extension is: file(?). I think all XBLA games look the same, i'm very new to this, but I think they're called CON/PIRS/LIVE files.
I've managed to extract this - no extension single file named: 668F6438875758443BE617C4AC63FB30B52981D258. I've used for this, program named: [Le Fluffie](http://skunkiebutt.com/?page_id=362). But there is a problem, the file before extracting is 702 MB big, but after extracting it with Le Fluffie, it has only 409 MB (the whole folder, with files).

I've explored the folders and it seems that, the only missing files is the game music (the most important thing, for me).



There must be hide the music in some way. I know it, because I've opened the data.toc file with NotePad++ and this is what looks like the original file list.



I've tried getting help with other smaller forums, and not related to game research, like XeNTaX. I don't know how to extract this hidden *.XMA files. Guys please help me with solving this problem!
