Which extension do the "CAB" have? Obviously not *.CAB

(It's near to impossible to tell more without a file sample.)

You should use forum's search before opening new threads on the same issue:

(If the files are encrypted they need to be decrypted first.)

A lot of mobile games are using the unity3d format these days, so maybe you should use Unity Studio to find what you're looking for.

Thank you, sorry if I did something wrong.
I think 'i've been able to open the cab files
Now I'm going to look for the 3d models I hope to not be encrypted
