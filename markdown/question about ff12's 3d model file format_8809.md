I've searching for a model viewer of final fantasy 12, in the end I found ModelViewerWXD3D9. I played with the program for a while and then I found that it doesn't handle skeletons and animations. So I want write a better viewer that handles these information. I got stuck by the file format, because I don't know how to reverse engineering a 3d file format. So can anyone help me about cracking these file's format?
