- Post Title: CPBC BoS .KLZ Extract &/or Conversion

This is more so a request  I guess, but does anyone have the Timtool or the Tim2 to TGA by Jamesuminator lying around on their PC and would be willing to upload it?

Now, if anyone wants to start over and create a tool from scratch that'd be greatly appreciated as well, now I'm not too smart with headers, strings, and such, but I did get to figure out that this was just a TIM2 file 

So if anyone could make a script to convert, thank you 

Edit: 
Sorry, can't attach file, KLZ not allowed? (not sure because it's just a mask type of an extension)
