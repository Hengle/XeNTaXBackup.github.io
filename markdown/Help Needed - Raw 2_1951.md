ok, not sure if this is the right place for this, but here goes..

i recently registered mexcom and have been playing with it.

i opened up "TexOther.fpk" and found the ring apron textures i was looking for, i then proceded to extract oner of the textures and edited it with photoshop, and then imported it back into the fpk. i then replaced the original fpk file in the game with the new modified version. i then loaded up the game without problem and selected the options that would use the ring apron i edited, the problem i have is that the ring apron appears as it should and not my new version?? what have i done wrong?

any help would be appreciated

The game is still reading that original texture. All indicates that you have not  overwritten it with new or to put differently the import was not sucessfull.

If it's an xbox, clear your cache on the x,y and z drives.
