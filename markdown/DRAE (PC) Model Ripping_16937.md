- Post Title: DR:AE (PC) Model Ripping?

Hey there, so I`ve recently been playing around with trying to rip the models from Danganronpa: Another Episode with Ninjaripper, and i`ve made some progress but there`s some problems I`m having. I can only get the ripper to work if I use the forced rip function, and although I can get the background models and certain parts such as the hacking gun and Komaru`s bracelet to rip just fine, this is what happens to Komaru herself





The mesh sort of explodes, and ends up split across multiple .rip files. This happens to Monokuma too, and even though I haven`t tested beyond the first area I assume it`d happen to any other character model too.

Can anyone help me out? I`d really like to get the models from this game. I could always go into the games files and try that way, but from what I`ve seen the model format for this game hasn`t been entirely figured out yet so I`m at a loss.

Update: I have also tried using the Intel Frame Analyzer method, and it produces the same results as Ninajripper
