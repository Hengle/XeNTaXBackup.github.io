- Post Title: [Request] Decrypted game files

Hi guys . Hope I am in the right area for making this request , if not I am asking for one of the moderators of this community to move the topic to the right section .

I am looking for some time now for game clients with Asian theme MMO , decrypted of course . Willing to pay for extra work that involves scripts for 3ds max to load full models (mesh , bones and animation ). 
If anyone interested in sharing or helping me with my request please contact me on skype id bodo1ro .

Thanks .
