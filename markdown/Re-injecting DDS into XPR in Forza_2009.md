- Post Title: Re-injecting DDS into XPR in Forza?

Hi,

I'm interested in purchasing a licence of this application but got a question for you.

I can see in the list of supported games that Forza is supported. However it is listed with CAB.
I'm interested in re-injecting the extracted and edited DDS into the XPR, is this supported?

By the way, is this utility Windows only?

Best regards,
Dossy

The utility is windows only. The XPR files are only marginally supported by this script for MultiEx Commander here: [viewtopic.php?p=6049#6049](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?p=6049#6049)

Also, this tool was mentioned by Rusty_LeCyborg as being able to open and inject into XPR files: [http://www.xbox-saves.com/pafiledb/pafi ... oad&id=713](http://www.xbox-saves.com/pafiledb/pafiledb.php?action=download&id=713)
