- Post Title: Seeking 3d modeling assistance (Sucker punch, Babydoll)

Hello Xentex forums, I started this thread to possibly get some help with a personal project of mine. I really like the movie and graphic novel Sucker punch. I have started roll playing as Babydoll another game and am in the process of creating her Avatar in the game, but I've run into a big problem with the head and face, my OCD hates anything I make no matter how close or how good it looks.

This is the project as it is right now(posted pictures below). I'm looking for a modeler that can take my work so far and turn it into that picture on the left with fine turning or tweaking. Any help would be much appreciated. The model is fully rigged and textured already, only the shape needs to be changed.

The end of the neck is very important, where the neck would meet the body can not be moved or changed or even subdivided, these verts line up with the body it is rigged to, if they are changed the neck will no longer line up.

If you have the time or a willing heart please post on the thread, I could use any help I can get. Thank you so much if you took the time to read my babbling.
