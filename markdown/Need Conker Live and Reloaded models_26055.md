- Post Title: Need Conker Live and Reloaded models

This is the biggest bane of my model ripping time: Conker: Live and Reloaded (Xbox). You may need to try various ripping programs to successfully rip the models from within the use of the xemu emulator:

The Class Twenty-Two Tank - both from when you first encounter it from the beginning of Chemical Warfare and when it gets destroyed during the battle in The Experiment, the Old War Steed with full health and both it's landing gear raised and lowered, the robot spider and jumping army crate from It's War, the 6 grenades - Frag, Stun, Magnova, CJ24, Smoke, and Napalm (from both old war and future war), the old war terminal, the Tediz submarine, and the ceiling earthguard (both solo and co-op mode models).

With the models extracted, I can see how they were better designed so I can interpret how they would function in a real life scenario.
