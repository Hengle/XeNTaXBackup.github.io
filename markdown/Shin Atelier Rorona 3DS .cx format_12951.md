- Post Title: Shin Atelier Rorona 3DS .cx format

Hey Guys.

Shin Atelier Rorona recently released for 3DS.

It still uses BCH (standard 3DS format) for its models, but they appear to be within a further container/light compression called .cx

Whats odd is the header still seems to be BCH.

I've uploaded a part of a file for anyone to take a look at, my guess is, once extracted/decompressed it'll just be a standard BCH file, complete with textures (I think).

Really interested in how they've converted the standard Rorona stuff to chibi.

Be great if anyone was interested in taking a look at this.
