This is here for other people's reference.

Format's pretty simple. A google search of the 16 byte header reveals the ".png" actually a .webp file. Rename xxx.png to xxx.webp and open in Google Chrome.

more info about which programs can open or convert them
[http://www.freewaregenius.com/convert-w ... ng-format/](http://www.freewaregenius.com/convert-webp-image-format-jpg-png-format/)

i think using dwebp.exe might be the fastest way to convert them
i attached a zip containing the dwebp.exe, a batch file for converting 
many at one time and a "converted" folder where the png files will end up.
you don't have to rename the extension from png, just drop the files
in the folder with the dwebp.exe and click the bat file.
