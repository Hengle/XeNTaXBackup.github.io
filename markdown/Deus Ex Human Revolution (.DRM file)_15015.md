Hi, continue discussion here: [viewtopic.php?f=10&t=7208](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=7208).

I told you this yesterday. Please don't open multiple topics on the same file format, you are free to ask in the thread I linked above. The last post is a few weeks old so there's no reason to open a new thread.

Cheers.
