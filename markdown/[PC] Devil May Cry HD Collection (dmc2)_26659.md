- Post Title: [PC] Devil May Cry HD Collection (dmc2)

I'm trying to find some tool to extract the textures of the DMC2 game from the hd collection. The file I want to extract is in .biz . I found something about a tool for that but the links are expired. If anyone has this tool or knows where to find it I would be very grateful. Help me

As far as I remember, it was a compressed dds file.
There was a TIM character in the header, but it was actually a dds file.
but I don't know how it's compressed.

I'm trying to do the same thing, actually I have the textures but they're not all, because I've used Ninjaripper on the opening of mission 7's gameplay, so I only have the surrounding models and textures (including Dante). I can't find the .biz file you stated, for me it's dmc2-0.nbz (I can extract it with WinRAR). It is in Games/Devil May Cry HD Collection/data/dmc2
where exactly is this .biz file?
