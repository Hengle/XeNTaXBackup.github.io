Hello everyone

I have a question is what I can access any FF9 3d Models with noesis of the PSX version "personal civil" "the map" "the effect" "and the city"?

because I saw this topic

[viewtopic.php?f=16&t=6250](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=6250)

but not all kinds of models

and is there another way to do this?

And thank you in advance
