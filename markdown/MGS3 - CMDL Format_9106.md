- Post Title: MGS3 - CMDL Format

In the Metal Gear Solid 3 - HD Collection, PS3 version, the audio, video, textures and models can be extracted with psarc.exe.
The textures are compressed in .gtf format (variable), but for models i can not find any software or script to convert these models to obj, 3ds or dae, for example ... 

If anyone is interested, I show some screenshots of a sample model.
