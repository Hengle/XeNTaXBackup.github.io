- Post Title: [PS2] [ŌKAMI] Ōkami PS2 Japanese Early Demo

Right off the bat, these are not the same files as from Ōkami HD! These files are from an early PS2 demo version, and feature different assets that I would like to extract. I've already tried using various tools from around the forums but haven't been able to find anything that works yet.

[This demo version](https://youtu.be/CnM0tAuuZFE) VS. [the HD version](https://youtu.be/2G8y-8QM-pQ).

[HERE](https://www.mediafire.com/folder/xz5ge6yj0kxcw/%C5%8Ckami+Trial+Promo+%28JP%29+%28DATA%29) are the files I would like extracted. I used [THIS](https://github.com/MaikelChan/AFSPacker) tool to unpack them. [HERE'S](https://www.mediafire.com/folder/53z7f6zs9j7cn/%C5%8Ckami_Trial_Promo_%28JP%29_%28ISO%29) the original ISO.

I don't understand your issue. AFSPacker works fine with those AFS archives you uploaded.

So what's the problem?

Extracting the AFS archives isn't the problem, it's extracting the .DAT and .BIN files. I'm trying to extract the content(s) from those. I hope that makes sense.
