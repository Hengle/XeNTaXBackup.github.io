Hi I opened this game files with POD extracter. I got a lot of txt files that i can edit right now. But I dont know how to repack. Can anyone teach me this QuickBMS thingy. I read a lot of documents in this forum but non of them helped me. I am simply a noob about this subject. If anyone can help me. Maybe we(I) can offer some money aswell.. We need a person who can open games language files...

TSTAMP is the 64bit timestamp, it's the time in which has been created the file (I guess since I tried only one of them on calcc and was Jan 2013).

I don't know what compression algorithm is used because the provided files didn't use compression so I left the default one (zlib).
If you have archives containing compressed files I would be happy to check them.

I know the topic is not quite about it, but since we are capable of unpacking and repacking (to some extent) the POD archives, I'd like to ask about the files that they contain.

I've already found the files responsible for the fonts. These are the .tex files in W32ART.POD and .fnt index files in W32ART02.POD.

I think the tex files are some kind of headerless DDS, because adding a random dds dxt5 header resulted in scrambled, though somewhat resembling a font texture, DDS file.

I am attaching two texes - one is the font I was talking about and the other one has a totally different structure so I thought I would add it just in case.

Fonts are easy format but that other file is Texture and looks compressed to me

You can use [TEX2DDS converter](http://www.theraffon.net/~spookcentral/pcgaming_gbtexconverter.zip) written by Jonathan Wilson for Ghostbusters: The Video Game.
