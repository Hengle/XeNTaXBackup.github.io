Hello, I have been following along with a lot of this forums topics, and I've probably figured out how to rip models from this game, but I can't seem to find any of the npc characters, only the player characters, so if anyone has this game, or has ripped these models for themselves, please let me know where I can find Aoko Aozaki, the character upgrade lady

I know that all the player characters are in chr, obj is for the treasure boxes, and other misc objects that are placed in dungeons, and cmn is for a default dungeon. I would have guessed that NPC files would have been in chr, but they were not, so I am clueless looking for the characters I want.

The model file for Aoko is chr/aok/0001.psp.im, you can find this file in pack/010007.cmp

Awesome, thanks for the quick reply! 

uhh, but how do you extract the cmp? I looked at this ([viewtopic.php?p=138978#p138978](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?p=138978#p138978)) forum, but it doesn't seem to work on my end, i used his decompressor quickbms script, but that just gave me another cmp file.

Every .cmp file in Extra is just compressed .pak. I haven't used that script but assuming it works correctly then you can rename decompressed file to .pak and run script for extracting .pak files.

I just renamed the decompressed_.cmp to .pak, and that fixed it
Yep that worked, man I wonder if I passed someone say that, but thanks for the help!
