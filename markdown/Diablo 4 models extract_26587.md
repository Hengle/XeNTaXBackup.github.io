Did anyone do this yet? Lilith in particular is what I am looking for. I am shocked there is 0 info on this considering Diablo 4 is probably the biggest game that will be releasing this year. Any info and help would be appreciated!

Maybe post some D4 model samples here?  Can't do nothing without seeing some samples.

Surely your not suggesting SOMEONE actually does some work on their own?

Beta testers have access to them.  I'm not a beta tester, so somebody has to step up and post something.

Try this tool for viewing and extracting.  They say D4 Beta is supported:

Yes CASCExplorer will work with the beta to access the files so use that. Would be interested to mess with the models as well.

Does not use .m3 files like other Blizzard games it seems. I have .app and .acr but seems like the .app include the mesh most likely but no idea how to check.

Attached is some of those extracted.

Looks more like their diablo 3 app format, rather than their m3. Different from D3 app of course!

May I ask what software do you use to view the model?

It's just a very, very raw maxscript I made to parse the model

Once it is in a usable state please post it, then I will do the usual batch conversion.

OK, that is great and all, but what can you tell us about the models for what you've seeing so far? Are a Polygon Nightmare like Forspoken? Texture size being 4k or less?

I imported only one model (lilith, well also a piece of some rock-wall lol) in order to check the format and make some notes. Used samples from above - don't have any textures, can't even test uv's. The series is very popular, I'm sure someone will make the tools quite soon, though if no one will - I will take this task myself

How far have you come? Have you been able to get the Vertices/Indices?
Or is this file format differently structured?

Asking due to interest in 3D printing the Lilith Shrine from the game and therefor not caring about normals, textures etc.

Well, they already started unpacking models in a NSFW way. They already made one for Lilith in one page.

Has anyone made any progress with importing the models into 3DS Max or Blender? I've tried several things, but failed.. Honestly don't know much about that side of ripping/importing/converting...

coredevel at zenhax was making good progress on the models and has created a working texture converter, but zenhax now appears to be broken so I'm now sure how to contact him to see how things are going.   Anyone know how to get a hold of coredevel?

Zenhax dead 
I was following the topic there too.

I hope you can share it, i'm helping a friend to work on a personal (non-lucrative) project and this would be very helpful.

Actually zenhax got hacked, so maybe they're taking the time to fix it and maybe upgrade it to a newer software version, i wish them the best and hope it comes back soon.

I know my first post was pretty short but i already contributed in the past on other games (i just forgot with which account/email), i'm not here to just beg stuff but the original work with diablo files is way too difficult for me, though i may be able to help with testing and improving existing tools.

Also the casual members might be doing this for fun and personal things (that's why i might have like 3 or 4 accounts and can never remember which one it is), the most active might be those who need it for lucrative projects. I don't want to complain, but i think the more casual who can help a little shouldn't be excluded..

Lol CASCExplorer has been updated to support the latest retail version of Diablo 4 (Fenris):

[https://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?t=26832](https://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?t=26832)

Also included in that thread is a link to the D4 texture tool.

It would be amazing if Griffon Studios could support Diablo 4 models.  Your Diablo Immortal script was excellent.
Let me know if any samples are required.

Thanks a billion :p ( so it was me being stupid again )

Looks like someone already said the model format is similar to the previous app format, so once I got everything exported, I'll see what I can do to get a models imported

Keep you posted

So when I took a look at the texture converter, it pointed to 2 different files, a meta file and a payload file.

That got me wondering, cuz I wasn't getting anywhere with the app files :/

So I found that there is a meta & a payload file for each of the appearances as well...

although it is in the earliest stage ever, I was able to import the 1mCube_AbsoluteBasic.app file and the 3m_Ring.app files.

both start with something that I don't have a clue yet, but then it has 2 zero int's and a 32 int, which I believe is the offset for the start of a glorious model.

From there one, I found the vertices, 36 byte each where the first 12 bytes hold 3 floats for its position ( the rest I didn't look into yet )

At the bottom, I found the faces represented by a UInt16.

For now, I manually set the offsets, but I believe that should be found in the meta files ( not sure where yet )

Here is the example for the 3m_Ring.app

Thanks Shakotay2 

not sure about the LOD atm, this file does not seem to have anything else, although a second part does exist, with less vertices.

Figuring out an way to avoid the manual offset and counting vertices/indices
