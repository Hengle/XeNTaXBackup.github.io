I need some help with DXT5A graphics format.

Here it is archive with three DXT5A textures (swizzled/tiled, xbox360):
[https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/123 ... izzled.rar](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/1237754/DXT5A_textures_swizzled.rar)
128x64
512x512
256x32

I have xbox360 swizzling code, but actually can't find out texel pitch and W/H values.
Also problem is DXT5A DDS preview in Windows (when they are already untiled).
Some *.dds examples are welcome, I need to research header.

This is for [GTA V Console Texture Editor](http://dageron.com/?page_id=4973&lang=en) development.

Very good! So, common information is that DXT5A is ATI1 format.
Thanks a lot, that helped. 

Swizzling attributes (if someone will be also interested):

Total size = dwWidth*dwHeight
W = dwWidth div 4
H = dwHeight div 4
TexelPitch = 8


I have added DXT5A support.
