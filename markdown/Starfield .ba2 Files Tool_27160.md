- Post Title: Starfield .ba2 Files Tool?

Hello, is there a tool to unpack the archive file to localize Starfield?

I think the language file is here.

You can extract the basic files from that archive with this QuickBMS script.  The extracted files are archives with a simple file table of file IDs and offsets to each string.

Thank you very much, my friend. How can we open the .gfx file for the font?
The file is here.

I wrote a C# project to extract and repack ba2 files
program: 
[https://www.mediafire.com/file/3sda9gau ... 2.rar/file](https://www.mediafire.com/file/3sda9gau8tq1ccb/extract-repack-ba2.rar/file)
Note: Put the Starfield - Localization.ba2 file in the folder where you extracted the program. extract extracts files, repack packs back


but I cannot open or extract the following files
starfield_en.dlstrings
starfield_en.ilstrings
starfield_en.strings
Files:
[https://www.mediafire.com/file/z10m4akc ... n.zip/file](https://www.mediafire.com/file/z10m4akcwbnoj1g/starfield_en.zip/file)

How can I extract/repackage these files. I want to localize this game.
