Hi, a few years ago I believe a similar question was posted but with no avail.

I'm wondering how to get files out of what seems to be these encrypted archives. They also exist in other games. 

I believe they also may be 2 part files, but not sure on that. I would really appreciate any help or any point in the right direction. Thank you all in advance!
