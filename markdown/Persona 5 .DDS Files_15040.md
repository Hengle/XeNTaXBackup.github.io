- Post Title: Persona 5 .DDS Files

I'm trying to extract portraits from Persona 5 (JP, PS3 version) and had modicum of luck getting most of them converted but some of them have weird format I'm not familiar with, it's similar to DDS but it lists DDS2 in the header and trying to export these as DDS results in garbled images like this:



Here's a few samples, hopefully someone will be able to help and figure proper way to convert these:

The portraits are split into two parts. You will need to manually combine them in a program like GIMP or Paint.net or Photoshop. This also goes for blinking frames and mouth frames.
