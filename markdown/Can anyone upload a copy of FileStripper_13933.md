- Post Title: Can anyone upload a copy of FileStripper?

Both Turfster and the other site link that hosts it is no longer available. I'm using it as I'm trying to extract audio from Far Cry 2. Someone said they get all the audio from it using FileStripper, but I can't find any downloads for it. Help would be greatly appreciated!
