- Post Title: The Sims (Xbox) XMA Files

Okay, So I extracted the XMA files from the .XWB file using unxwb and tried to convert the resulting .XMA files to PCM wav but wasn't able to using both toWAV and XMAEncode

I tried extracting the XMA files without any additional header info, added Alpha's XMARIFFHeader and it still didn't convert for me.

So I come to you Xentax for your guidance.

Here's the first 10MB of the .XWB file.

EDIT: Sorry, forgot that Xbox uses ADPCM and not XMA 

Anyway, I tried Alpha's Xbox ADPCM script in QuickBMS and it didn't recognize the audio either.

EDIT #2: Never mind yet again I've managed to solve the problem.
