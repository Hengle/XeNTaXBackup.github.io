- Post Title: Ripping Effect Objects from Jojo's Bizarre Adventure: Eyes of Heaven

Hi everyone!
So I've been able to finally rip my copy of Eyes of Heaven to just a bunch of raw as heck XFBIN files. I've been lucky enough to use CPK_Unpacker to pull them into something usable by noesis, however one thing is still eluding me: Where the heck can I find the stage elements? I'm honestly looking for the Death 13 model from the Stage marked sa03b.xfbin, but I haven't got the slightest on how to deduce its whereabouts. Might one of you in the know be willing to share some knowledge with me? I'm able to get things into an editor-friendly format as-is, so just locating the bugger would be sufficient for me.
Thank you all for your time reading this!

I'm having a hell of a time in general extracting anything stage-wise into a state of usability. Perhaps one of you wise-folk have encountered something similar in ripping different games and engineered a fix? Thanks again for your time!
