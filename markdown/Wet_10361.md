Hi, guys! 

I have a problem - music in this game (Wet) is in XMA format, so.. i tried to use xma2encode to extract it, but it ended with error for me..

Can you look this file, maybe i do something wrong, or maybe is has not-standart xma structure. Sure it can be extracted, but can't figure out how..

PS. I was looking for this exact track on the internet, and it makes me sad. This music written by band Anonymus (track called thrash and wet, pretty self-explaining, huh)specially for this game, and it's not presented anywhere..

Download [QuickBMS](http://aluigi.altervista.org/papers/quickbms.zip)

And [XMA Parse](http://hcs64.com/files/xma_parse011.zip)

Extract both QuickBMS and XMA Parse into the same folder.

Save [AlphaTwentyThree's XMA Transform script](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=17&t=9023) into a text file and put it into the QuickBMS folder.

Run QuickBMS, select the XMA transform script, then the "mu_l07_skydive.xma" and then where you would like to output the new file.

This will add a proper XMA header to the file.

After all that, convert it using [ToWAV](http://www.ctpax-x.org/?goto=files&show=24)

Look for the text ">>> Скачать <<<" on the page, click that to download ToWAV
