Unpakke is a small and easy to use tool for the modification of resource files. It provides an elegant solution to the problem of distributing large archives, as it gives the ability to distribute only the modified files.

More information can be found here : [http://nullsecurity.org/unpakke/](http://nullsecurity.org/unpakke/)

===================================================
Current version: 1.2 (build 1008)

I've just added another module - upkk_bf.dll (CryoBF - 2.02.0 header) for Nostradamus: The Last Prophecy and Safecracker: The Ultimate Puzzle Adventure

It will probably work for other games too, and i'll be happy to hear for successful modifications with it. 

P.S.
Anyone who can provide me with icons from other games using this type of archive will win a pint of virtual beer from me. 

Edit:
And another one - upkk_syb.dll (VXBG header) for Syberia 2

Yet another module for unpakke (now version 0.4b) can be downloaded from [nullsecurity.org](http://nullsecurity.org)
It's called upkk_pak_t2.dll and with him you can repack the "Dracula: Origin"'s PAK archives.
Unfortunately if you try to repack sounds_en.pak the game will not have any sound on the characters talk. The problem is mainly in the sounds_en.pak's logic (but ofcourse   ), and not in the unpakke module!

Other than that, you can do whatever you like.

A new module for unpakke is ready to be downloaded from nullsecurity.org!
This time you can unpack the game "A new beginning" using upkk_vis3.dll
Unfortunately all the PNG images in the archives are with broken dimensions in the IHDR, but you can easily bruteforce it and retrieve the right width and height. I'm writing a tutorial right now so stay tuned on [nullsecurity.org](http://nullsecurity.org) for more news!

Here's the game with some modifications - a little translation in Bulgarian language.

Probably this is not supported BF file. Send me some sample files from the game and I'll test it.

Few days ago I've made a Unpakke port of my "Scratches: Director's Cut" pack/unpakker. I did it by a request from a user called "micartu" and since i rarely do requests, (yeah, I'm that kind of ass) if you found the module useful for your translation project, thank him when you see him around.

Hi,
I had the same problem and I just registered to post a solution.

I came across the bfbs tool on this page [http://hcs64.com/vgm_ripping.html](http://hcs64.com/vgm_ripping.html).
It isn't intended to work with Warrior Within BF files BUT you can deactivate the "format error2" and "format error6" errors in the source code and recompile it.
It worked like a charm with me .

As much as i remember, the dialogs were in one quite big (i think about 50MB) XML file.
About the fonts i don't remember, but the game worked with Cyrillic alphabet, so Latin and Cyrillic should be supported by default.

Last few days I've made a research over "Ridge Racer Unbounded" encrypted resource files, so today I've released a module for the game. BUT, the module is a beta version, which means you can only "UNPACK" the files, and you cannot "PACK" them back.
The "PACK" support will be added soon (i hope), so stay tuned.

Here's another module. This time for "Shoot Many Robots" .SAR files. The file entries are key-XOR encrypted. The module supports both packing and unpacking as usual.

And before doing anything, read the included upkk_sar.txt !

Unfortunately I can't help you here. Most of the time I just pre-pack the game resources and if the game runs good I considered it as "job done". Therefore, I don't get deeper into the unpacked resources.
However, you will probably find more help here in the forums, since as much as I remember someone already asked a similar question about the fonts.

P.S.
I'm XpoZed, that "veteran" is my current user rank, set by the forum.

nullsecurity.org is not dead. Last few days my FREE hosting providers from 000webhost.com had some DDoS issues so the server where my site is located was shut down. That of course sucks, but you get what you pay for after all, and in my case I pay nothing (and I won't pay until I get enough donations to use a paid service).

Right now the site is working fine, so you'll be able to download Unpakke and its modules.

Anyways, lately I'm quite busy with my job that i do for living, so I didn't release anything new (well, i didn't release anything public...). However, when the game "Deponia" get to the stores officially I will release an updated version of the "upkk_vis3" module, so you can repack it. But not before the game is officially released...

Bye now, and have fun using Unpakke.

Using mangled PNGs again.
I didn't get that...

Oh... Which part?
My comment in brackets was about strange design of this "encryption", and not about your program. Or was it not this part?

If you are talking about VIS3, it has simple XOR encryption with a MD5 string, which is often used here and there.
I've seen few games using VIS3 (all made by Daedalic ent.) and all of them has used different version of the format, e.g. one uses unicode string for MD5, other uses ANSII string, the third one is using byteswapped DWORDs, chunked file entries, etc. etc.

However, they are all using PNG's with obfuscated IHDR chunk, that is easily bruteforced, like I did here : [http://www.nullsecurity.org/article/a_n ... png_fixing](http://www.nullsecurity.org/article/a_new_beginning-png_fixing) for the game "A new beginning".

So nothing strange here, just few light unpacking protections. 

You should check Fallout 3's BSA's or even better "Ridge Racer Unbounded"'s BFS1 format that it turns out to be a whole filesystem, with few encryptions, obfuscations and even its own compression algorithm.

Yep, I actually found that page before I found about unpakke.
Anyway, I gave the string for Satinav... It also seems to have a type 12 for xml, which can be decrypted with same XOR as header, then unpacked with zlib, but in several sections or something...

Yep, type 0x12 is a chunked zip. I have coded the module already but I'll put it on my site when the game is officially released.

Done! Can you test it? You will have to replace the "magic" variable in unpakke.ini with "d9ef88157bcbcae0"

Hi, i have big problem with Unpakke prog. I have two versions of A new beginning game - ENG and GER game and when i use unpakke old version, then after unpack/pack (without changes in xml), output file is smaller and game wont run. When i use newest version of unpakke, then when i try to unpack vis files, then UNKNOWN version appears and files have 0bytes. Same problem is with game Harveys neue augen. Please help me.

Download the latest VIS3 module that includes "unpakke.ini"
Open "unpakke.ini" and check the "magic" value. There is a list of magic codes for all the supported games in the file. Take the "A new beginning" hash and replace the magic value with it.
Now try to unpack the files again and they should have no problems (I've already tried ).

Hello again. No success. Still unknown file and then 0byte file.

i call prog with this: unpakke upkk_vis3 unpack data.vis scene

Please, download my files (check harveys neue augen auch - for right ID) and tell me, what i do wrong.

Like i said, you need to download upkk_vis3.dll again, including the unpakke.ini file in the same archive.
Then use:

```
unpakke upkk_vis3.dll unpack data.vis scene
```

I try it myself and it did work for both files (German and English version).

Read this: http://www.nullsecurity.org/article/a_n ... png_fixing

I have problem with compile the code. And is there any faster solution than passing through the pictures one by one? And one more question - Where are the actual texts to translate? In these png files?

Thx
The link i give you about fixing the png's is just an solution example. If you need to fix all the PNG's at once, you have to implement your own tool, using my technique. As much as i remember there was a tool already from some guy on the forums here, and was written for the game "A new beginning". However i think it might work without any problem for "Deponia" and other games using VIS3.
The text strings are located in the only one .XML file stored in data.vis (the largest file there, should be around 40-50MBs)

I told you I've used unpakke and upkk_vis3.dll downloaded from the site. Make sure you have the right unpakke.ini in your unpakke directory, and the magic value is the correct one.

The game is that: Harvey´s New Eyes

From the audio, it seems to be Deponia German/English/Italian/Spanish, but from the xml it looks like Italian/Spanish only.

there is a small problem with edna new eyes - english version

Key working fine, i think. I unpacked file with magic=a7fbf54a6e48f7bca7fbf54a6e48f7bc (with no errors), but when you repack SCENE directory back to vis file (with no errors), then data.vis is smaller and game wont run. I try it without any changes in xml file or file structure. Please check on english version file uploaded early. i use this command: unpakke upkk_vis3 pack scene data.vis  , Last Unpakke files, Last Zlib files, Last VIS command. When i then try to unpack smaller bad file, then "unknown code" message goes and unpakke window crashes.

original size: 71426994, size after repack 69320097

log of game:

20:47:31: Error: Failed to initialize the composed file 'C:\Program Files\Daedalic Entertainment\Harvey´s New Eyesa\data.vis'. Invalid header.
20:47:31: Error: Loading game from file 'data.vis' failed!
20:47:31: Error: Init failed, could not load game

> there is a small problem with edna new eyes - english version
I tried the english version of Harvey's New Eyes (harvey.exe version is 1.3.0.0).
I unpacked the data.vis with a7fbf54a6e48f7bca7fbf54a6e48f7bc magic value: 'unpakke.exe upkk_vis3.dll unpack data.vis scene'.
I edited (with windows notepad)  a sentence in the 00001552.cxml with miscellaneous characters. Then I packed back: 'unpakke.exe upkk_vis3.dll pack scene data.vis' and replaced the original file.
Original size:  73 129 216
New size:      72 801 511

[The game runs perfectly.](http://oi50.tinypic.com/2ry3qxz.jpg)
I'm using the latest unpakke.exe (0.4.0.0), the latest upkk_vis3.dll (1.3.0.0) and zlib1.dll version is  1.2.5.0.

Thank you for your reply. Please download this archive: [http://www.ulozto.net/xWoymrT/upk-harveys-zip](http://www.ulozto.net/xWoymrT/upk-harveys-zip) and try unpack and pack with my unpakke folder. I want be 100percent sure, that problem is in this package or is in my pc system. All files downloaded two days ago, i think, are latest.

Thank you

BTW: file size differencies are too, when i changes nothing! Only unpack vis to folder and then repack back to vis.

I tried it. It's OK.

I think the file size differences are irrelevant. Unpakke definitely uses different compress method/ratio than the game developers' tool.

Because that thread got pretty much flooded with requests for VIS3 based games like Deponia, Deponia 2, Deponia 8932894239, different language / release versions and so on, I've decided to write a "prediction" tool for the encryption key of the files.
The tools works with magic and dragon spit, so make sure you check it out before directly contacting me.

So, check out this thread [viewtopic.php?f=32&t=10065](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=32&t=10065) before posting questions about VIS3 games here!

Any feedback THERE will be appreciated. Really.

Here's something new from me: "The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing"



Here I've translated few strings in Bulgarian language. Unfortunately the developers didn't add Cyrillic alphabet support (even that the fonts are compatible), so i had to patch the CreateFontW function of the game's main executable.
Nevertheless, everything looks fine.

Could you help me with unpacking *.n2pk file that holding the strings for the game?
Or, is there any trick that you make any modification without extra program? I mean just opening with Notepad++ and editing directly in the file...

Hi guys,

XpoZed thanks alot for this tool  I have a question though, excuse for asking this noob question but I have no experience in any form of coding/scripting.

Can someone show me how to extract each file within subfolders for the game The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing into the same directory for each archive, I have tried creating a batch file but im doing something wrong  here is the batch as it is right now :  

for /r %%F in %%~ni.n2pk do unpakke upkk_n2pk.dll unpack %%~ni.n2pk
pause


I can do each archive seperately but that will take ages 
Can someone help me create the correct batch file?

Here's some batch code that will do the trick:

```
call :recurse
goto :eof

:recurse
for %%f in (*.n2pk) do unpakke upkk_n2pk.dll unpack %%f %%d_unpacked
for /D %%d in (*) do (
    cd %%d
    call :recurse
    cd ..
)
exit /b
```

execute it from the Van Helsing's main directory, but before that, you should add Unpakke's main directory to your Environment Variables Path.
Here's some information how you can achieve that: [http://www.computerhope.com/issues/ch000549.htm](http://www.computerhope.com/issues/ch000549.htm)

If everything is fine, then wherever you are located in CMD, and by just typing "Unpakke", the program's main screen should appear.

Hope that helps!

Got some free time to fix the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. module. It now works for all three parts of the game - "S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Shadow of Chernobyl", "S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Clear Sky" and "S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Call of Pripyat"

You can now both unpack and pack the files, so... yeah, whatever.

Here's something new from me... After a day of playing with the XOR encryption algorithm of "Castlevania: Lords of Shadow - Ultimate Edition", I was able to finally break and reverse it, so I'm releasing a module for the game.

As usual, you can both, unpack and pack the game resources. 

Have fun and happy modding!

Just a little update, since few days ago "Memoria" was released, you can unpack the resource files with unpakke, using this key "a986265a4cba51d3".
The correct key was successfully obtained by "VIS3 key hound".

Just wanted to say thank you for your hard work.  I was very happy with unpakke's functionality!    I used the unpacker to swap monster models within a game.  Thanks to you, I was able to enjoy the game more!  

> it seems n2pk dll does not work with the new released The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing II.

That's too bad.  Hopefully he will add that one too!

P.S.  I encourage everyone to use the help file at [http://www.nullsecurity.org/download/56 ... 586b54c3ff](http://www.nullsecurity.org/download/5686bdffbc01e4fe3dee29586b54c3ff) it was very helpful for me.

I'm currently working on a new version of Unpakke, where third party users will be able (if they have enough programming skills) to design their own modules.
It also has GUI, so... yeah.   

And that's why I was off lately (i have a job and real life too).

Don't get too excited, it'll still be "shit" as some people say, but meh.

- Post Title: Re: XpoZed's Unpakke project

How do I download Unpakke? The link in the 1st post doesn't work for me.

Also, I'm trying to use it to extract the RS2.$hd$.bik.BF file from Red Steel 2 for the Wii.
Online research showed that Unpakke could extract .BF files.
I know .bik is a Wii video file that I can convert to an .mp4 with FFMPEG.
I just need a way to extract it.

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

The URL should work.

About the .BF file, keep in mind that the extension doesn't mean anything. Unpakke can unpack with a 100% success only the package files from games listed on the Unpakke's homepage.

.BIK should stand for Bink Video video file from RAD game tools, unless it's something else, sharing the same extension.

Good luck!

It also has GUI, so... yeah.   

And that's why I was off lately (i have a job and real life too).

Don't get too excited, it'll still be "shit" as some people say, but meh.

Hello XpoZed

I have a problem with The Whispered World Special Edition.
I unpack the data.vis file with unpakke, but no xml file, only oggs and pngs. There's one big (5 Mb) ogg file (00003257.ogg), probably this is the encoded xml file. "VBIN" in the file's header.

Could you support these encoded xml files in the 1.0 version of unpakke?

Thanks!

Um... i've released a brand new Unpakke version.
It comes with a GUI and module SDK so you can now build your own modules and stuff.
The old modules are no longer working with the new version, but i left the (now) old 0.4b for download as well.

I've also released the first module for Wolfenstein: The New Order. It should also work with Wolfenstein: The Old Blood and other games using the id Tech 5 engine.

So, yeah. That's pretty much everything for now.

Thanks to everyone who supported the project one way or another during the years.

Is there a way to unpack .n2pk files that are from Neocore's new game Inquisitor Martyr? Tried using the Van Helsing module for unpacking it and it does not seem to be working.

*Edit: Nevermind, I'm an idiot. I just needed to use the older version.

Are you sure you are providing the correct decryption key in unpakke.ini?

Hi everyone!  
I need help to unpack old .bf files from “Return to Mysterious Island”. But, I don’t understand how to louche unpakke0.4b. Archive from “[http://www.nullsecurity.org/unpakke](http://www.nullsecurity.org/unpakke)” has only 29 KB .exe file. And, than I try to start this file, flashes window of program and its close. What I need to do, to louche it? And is it works on Windows 8.1 or 7?
Thanks!)

There doesn't appear to have been any updates to the Unpakke utility and modules for some time now.

Is this project stopped?

There are literally thousands of games that can be added to this project (via modules).

It would be really good if additional modules are created, especially for games that are password protected!

Anyone?

The project is not stopped, i just don't have time to make modules myself lately. However, since Unpakke 1.0 there's API reference you can use, to write your own modules.

I encourage everyone to use it and be involved in the Unpakke project.

Thanks for the prompt reply, and for confirming that this project is not stopped, as such!

However, in order to create modules for Unpakke, requires knowledge of Windows API, and also when and how to apply them. This knowledge is something I do not have.

Is there some tutorial or guide on how to actually create game modules?

There's a relatively self-explanatory API reference on the website. I'm saying "relatively", because i assume anyone who decides to bother with it, has some programing experience.

Ithink it would be helpful if you share the source of your modules. Or at least some of them as example.

There's literally an example module + somewhat detailed examples on each function the API has.

Hello dear forum users.
Didn't want to create a new topic, because this topic has already discussed the *.N2PK file format and maybe you can help me?
I need to access the Deathtrap localization files, which are in the Files.N2PK format
Please advise me how to do this. You need to unpack the file for editing and then pack it back.
Thanks in advance.
