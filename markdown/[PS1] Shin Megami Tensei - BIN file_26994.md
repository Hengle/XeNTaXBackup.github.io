- Post Title: [PS1] Shin Megami Tensei - BIN file

I'd like to decrypt the files in Shin Megami Tensei for the PS1, but I find myself stuck on a file simply called "DATA.BIN". I can't find anything on the internet for decrypting it. Someone made an English fan translation for the game, so it must be possible to decrypt, but the translator hasn't responded to my attempts at contact.

File link: [https://mega.nz/file/sTNxhSpR#B77-wo6C2 ... -UVDtAFUPU](https://mega.nz/file/sTNxhSpR#B77-wo6C2w9PHpbbgFm8zTLcV_YihR48j-UVDtAFUPU)

The file is from a version with the English translation patch applied, if that matters.
