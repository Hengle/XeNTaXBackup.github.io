- Post Title: Fate Extella Link MDL Models Decompression?

So I have the MDL files from fate/extella link and it seems like noesis isn't recognizing the texture pngs as materials for the model. I think I might have to decompress it, but I am not sure. Can someone help me figure out why textures are not exporting with the model?

Here is a sample model with all the textures attached

So you can load the model with Noesis but no materials are applied, is that what this is all about?

No, the file is not compressed. You can extract it directly with hex2obj:
