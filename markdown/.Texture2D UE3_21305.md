Hi,
I'm working on this format after extracting my desired upk successfully. Could anyone help and give me a hint or instruction to read and parse this file to another, such as .dds or .png? Thanks so much

Have you tried using Umodel?
Its specifically for Unreal Engine 3 and 4 models animations and textures.

Hi, this is for my own tool to use specifically in my favourite game, which is not supported by Umodel.

However, I've figured it out  Thanks for your concern
