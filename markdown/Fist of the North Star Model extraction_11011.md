- Post Title: Fist of the North Star Model extraction

Hi,

I've been working myself on extracting models from this game & thats how far I've gotton

I see the list of the models in noesisi but as you can see it shows a name but something else appears

For example 

Kenshiro's model and I only see a bottle.





others will not open and the big models will cause the program to crash

Can anyone help me with the next step ?

Thank you
