edat files are encrypted with NPDRM algorithm. 

if you bought the game off PSN and copied it off your ps3, and also can access PSN license files off your console (meaning that it's homebrew capable) you can write a tool to decrypt it. the NPDRM algorithm is mostly worked out on ps3hax forum, but requires that you extract some files off your ps3.

i think i saw a tool in circulation that could automate this task. don't remember where.
