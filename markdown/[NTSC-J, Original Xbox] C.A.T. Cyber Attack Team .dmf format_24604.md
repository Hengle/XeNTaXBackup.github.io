Hi, I'd like some assistance in extracting the ".dmf" files from this game, as far as I looked into CXBX-R's debugger tool, it's a graphic file I dunno how to rip from. I'll link one file from the game itself (purchased legally and imported), this should contain one of the main protagonists presented on the title screen.

Well, it requires much more investigation, but this article may be a good start

Also, it looks more like an archive to me which contain other files.
You can spot some filenames on the end of the archive and also some DDS headers in the data section.
