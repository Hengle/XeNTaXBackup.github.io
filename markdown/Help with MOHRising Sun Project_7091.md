- Post Title: Help with MOH:Rising Sun Project

Hi I was wondering if I could get help with a project that I am currently working on. I dont know much at all about what you guys do here but from what Ive read up on I think there's a possibility that I could use some of this stuff for a project I am working on.

Fist about my project:
     Medal of Honor Rising Sun Online for ps2 is probably my favorite game of all time but since it was terribly overshadowed by a less than mediocre single player campaign it didn't become extremely popular.  Never the less it has a very dedicated community of people that love that game and still enjoy it even though its out dated.  Unfortunately for us EA decided to shut down the servers in January of 2007 we haven't been able to play since.  However me and a buddy of mine have recently seen some light on playing our favorite game again.  You see Medal of Honor Allied Assault for PC is a very MOD and custom map friendly game that was released about a year before Rising Sun was.  We know these maps can be remade via the map editor which we are trying to learn, someone did a fantastic job making one of the maps already so we know it is possible.  This project is in its infant stages for us but we are continuing to learn and have already imported some gun mods and ps3 controller use.  The thing about the maps is I'm almost completely sure that the maps were made completely in the same map builder they used for allied assault.  The fact that someone created a map from Rising Sun so well only furthers this idea.

What Im Asking:
     What we think may be possible is actually accessing the map files from the game its self and seeing if they will load in the map building program.  I know it seems like a long shot but it would be incredible for our project if we got it to load.  Now this may sound laughable to you guys I have no idea Im not totally up to speed on what you guys are doing, if its not possible let me know.  Also, there were audio files that played behind each map that really set the tone of each map they would be great to have in our servers when playing the game on allied assault.  I believe the map files are .bsp or possibly .map not sure but I dont know what format the sounds are in.

If any of this is possible please let me know and if its not thats fine to were just looking for ways to make our project go quicker so we can get back to playing the game we love.  If you have any more questions just ask me, thanks for reading.

edit: if this is in the wrong topic feel free to move it accordingly
