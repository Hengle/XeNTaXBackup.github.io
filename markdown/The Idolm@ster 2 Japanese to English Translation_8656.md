- Post Title: The Idolm@ster 2 Japanese to English Translation

I'm recently began attempting to translating this game into English with a group of people but I hit a fairly large roadblock in trying to find the text in the game. Looking through both the Xbox 360 version files and the PS3 version files I managed to locate a gscripts folder that I have assumed would contain the  text to translate ( note that it's  all in japanese and is encoded as such). Within I've found a large amount of .scb files that when comparing the exact same files from two different consoles are completely different files. I'm not entirely sure what these .scb files are whether they are archives or maybe encrypted files of some sort but any help in finding a method to extract the text from these files is greatly appreciated.

Note: These files could possibly contain anything from paths to character models, names, dialogue etc.

I've uploaded an example file since there are quite a number of these files.

Thanks for any help in advance!

all the files are identical to the first game only they encrypted everything so without that key nothing can happen.
