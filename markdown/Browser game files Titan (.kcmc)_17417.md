Please, help to parse files (.kcmc) from one browser game.
Presumably (judging by the name) in the files are stored the animation of the sprites of the body and legs of robots.

I can't see anything in binaries. Tried scanning to find textures/images but got binary rubbish. Files doesn't have headers, no pointers, no sections. Total disaster, this may need game reverse engineering, nothing to parse from files (probably compressed using unknown algorithm)
