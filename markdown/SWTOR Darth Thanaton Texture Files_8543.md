- Post Title: SWTOR Darth Thanaton Texture Files

Well i'm new to the forums but i have a request already, sorry about that   . In the game Star Wars The Old Republic is a character named Thanaton who possesses a tattoo on his right eye. So i would appreciate it if someone gets the texture files of Thanaton or better the tatttoo itself, thanks.

I may be wrong, but I believe this is the texture for Darth Thanaton's tattoo, at least it matches up to [the screenshot at Wookieepedia](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/File:DarthThanaton0001.jpg).
File name: /resources/art/dynamic/player_character/face_customization/tattoos/tattoo_human_non_sw02_u.dds
(from swtor_main_art_dynamic_head_1.tor)

Based on the file name, any human Sith Warrior player character can sport it.
Please note that the texture looks distorted, but it will display correctly if it is projected onto a spherical form like Darth Thanaton's face.

And no, I will not answer any additional requests, so please do not start asking for files, but look for them yourselves.

Sorry for double post, but i have tried to get the files myself, but i got problems with that. If i try to use the normal Easymyp, i start the program, and it doesn't let me open tor files. Or i tried the Debug version, and than it can open tor files, but the dds files are not named properly and i can't extract them neither.

Is there no better version of this tattoo? Or is this the only size available?

In the next patch (1.2), they want to increase the texture quality but I am not sure if this will include the tattoo as well.

Therefore, the image I posted is the best quality you can get.
However, you can usually scale up an image by at least 50% without there being any noticeable quality losses.
And if you are really inclined, you can recreate the tattoo as a vector graphics file (e.g. a .svg file) that can be scaleable. But if you do not have any experience in that field, this will be a rather difficult task.

Have you tried my tutorial [here](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?p=69545#p69545)? You should have no problems following the instructions there. Just make sure to extract the whole archive and not just individual files since that may result in an error.

In case of further problems, please state what you tried to do, what did not work and any error message that was shown since we cannot help you otherwise.

Thanks, it works now. But now i have problems finding a file. I can view all of them and found the right one more or less. It's the complexion of Thanaton, his face looks older. I found the correct one i think but is has a beard and i cannot find the file without a beard.
