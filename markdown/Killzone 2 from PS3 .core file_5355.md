- Post Title: Killzone 2 from PS3 .core file

Hello everyone
I want to rip model file from Killzone 2 from PS3. I extracted all files from data_ps3.psarc and I got a lot of .core files. I knew where are model files but I don't have any experience about how to read and edit HEX code.

Here, This is sample file from Killzone 2.
