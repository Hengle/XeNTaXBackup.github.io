What is the minimum age to compete in an Ironman 70.3 Triathlon or a full Ironman Triathlon? How old do I have to be to compete in an Ironman 70.3 Triathlon, I am almost 16 years of age, will I be able compete once 16? Does it differ from event to event? Which triathlon events can I compete in during 2011 when I am 16? Thanks in advance.

That information is likely available since the event most likely has passed.
