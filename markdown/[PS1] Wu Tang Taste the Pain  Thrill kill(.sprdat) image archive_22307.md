Hi,
i need help to edit spr/dat from Wu tang taste the pain and thrill kill PS1 game.
the spr file should contain headers, the dat file contains images in unknown format, maybe in 16bit

is there any tool or script to convert raw image to bmp or png?

Well, The info above is correct, but unfortunately can´t see any offset filesize to make a unpack of those images.

Although, the image is uncompressed and with the color palette inside it, you can manually indicate where it is and thus remove the image.
