- Post Title: .bin file

hello

i make this post because luigi auriema request this one . in this post  : [http://aluigi.freeforums.org/mix-file-o ... -t400.html](http://aluigi.freeforums.org/mix-file-of-scar-game-t400.html)

he work on a extractor for mix file file used in some game like sbk09, scar etc etc

the last game who use .file file is : v8 superstars 

here the link of the demo :  [http://www.speedmaniacs.com/files_downl ... g_demo.exe](http://www.speedmaniacs.com/files_downloads/superstarsv8racing_demo.exe)

after the use of the mix tool made by luigi ,after extract , i have the dds in one folder , the 3d of the track for exempl is packed one one file , .bin

here you have the file in.bin i speak about : [http://lmdcs2.free.fr/v8/](http://lmdcs2.free.fr/v8/) 

after extract of the .mix file, there are some .bin file :

portimao.bin

PORTIMAO_WET.BIN

if you open the file PORTIMAO.SCN with window bloc note you can see this thing :


[SceneDatabase]
ScnFile0 = Portimao.bin
AfxFlowFile = [GamePath]\Data\AfxFlow.afl

EnvFile = Portimao_env.env
AdjFile = Portimao.adj
SplFile = Portimao.spl
StrGrdSplFile = StartGrid.spl
BufFile = Portimao.buf
CamFile = Portimao.cam
CutScene = Portimao_cut_scene.bin
CamPlaylist = Portimao_cut_scene_anim.xml
RenderPipeFile = [GamePath]\Data\RenderPipeline_GameWorld.rpl


[GameCustom]

same thing with PORTIMAO_WET.SCN :

[SceneDatabase]
ScnFile0 = Portimao_Wet.bin
AfxFlowFile = [GamePath]\Data\AfxFlow.afl

EnvFile = Portimao_Wet_env.env
AdjFile = Portimao.adj
SplFile = Portimao.spl
StrGrdSplFile = StartGrid.spl
BufFile = Portimao.buf
CamFile = Portimao.cam
CutScene = Portimao_cut_scene.bin
CamPlaylist = Portimao_cut_scene_anim.xml
RenderPipeFile = [GamePath]\Data\RenderPipeline_GameWorld.rpl


[GameCustom]

the 3d seem to be on the .bin file

and luigi say : the format of the GARCHIVE files is not much clear, maybe try to propose this file format on xentax.

This is a 3D Model request, so I've moved it.

It sure looks like all the 3D model stuff is in the BIN file you uploaded. Perhaps some of the Graphics/Modellers here can find out the format?
