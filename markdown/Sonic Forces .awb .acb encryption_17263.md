Sonic Forces main audio files are encrypted. Here's a matching ACB and AWB archive.

You can try out the newest version of [VGMToolbox](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/315859338650451978/377640516159799296/VGMToolbox-1045.7z). It worked for me, at least. Some files may be named incorrectly, though, which is probably the tool's problem.

I downloaded this compiled version earlier from Sonic Retro. It didn't work on the particular files I have but there are decrypted audio files leaking around.
