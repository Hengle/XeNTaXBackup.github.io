I'm sure I just read this on TRF...

But yeah, it'll get taken down for copyright I'd imagine.

You could try somewhere like GFX world  its a website dedicated to all things GFX. but its all warez so you can post pirated 3d apps, stolen models, anything you like as long as its GFX related ( its where i post all my game model rips ). And in all honesty, there probably isnt much stopping you from uploading all your models to somewhere like rapidshare / hotfile any other Hostfile service. and just posting a link on face book about it. as long as your not hosting files on facebooks servers i wouldnt think they would care all that much.
