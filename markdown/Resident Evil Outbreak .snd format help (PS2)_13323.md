- Post Title: Resident Evil Outbreak .snd format help (PS2)

After some digging around and a quite a bit of time on google I've learned that Cri Middleware dealt with the audio for this game and found programs to open and play their .adx format but along with the .adx there are quite a few .snd files and I haven't the slightest idea of how to open these files or even get them to play.

I've tried Ravioli explorer, vgmstream and a few other programs with no luck, but I'm starting to suspect these files are package files because there's only one or two files per enemy but in the game the enemies all have multiple sounds associated with them.

Also after opening the .snd in a Hex editor MOMO is the first line followed but stuff like IECSsreV and IECSdaeH@ hopefully that information is helpful to anyone.

So could anyone maybe shine some light on this? I can provide a few samples if anyone needs them.

I've solved my issue with a program called MFaudio. 
It's useful for almost any ps2 era audio files so you should really check it out if you're trying to get into any ps2 audio.
Just a heads up though, it has a few things you need to set up in order for it to work well but they're pretty simple if you know anything about audio.
