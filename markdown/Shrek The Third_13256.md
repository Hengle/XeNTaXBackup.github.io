I am trying to rip the music from the Shrek the Third game, but I've never dealt with these kinds of files before. I don't know where to begin. Can anyone help?

PS2, I just put the disc in the computer. I figure the files are the same.

The best thing I can recommend is uploading a sample of an audio file.

There isn't one, or I would have done it already. The audio files are packed away. I know it can be done, however. What I could do is upload the entire game files, if someone is up to looking through everything.

If you know where the audio is stored, upload those file/s.

This is the whole thing. I can't pinpoint where the music is, I've never dealt with something like this before. And it doesn't help that I'm not an expert at extracting.

Just look for a "streams" file, this is the archive that contains the music.

Streams, got it. Any program recommendation?

It is uncompressed. Just load it up in any sound editor as RAW PCM stereo 16 bit file.

In case you need proper filenames, you need to parse the archive somehow.

What I meant was, how do I get the individual files extracted?

It's not uncompressed. Streams.res is Sony ADPCM

EDIT: The PS2 version is Sony ADPCM whilst the PC version is raw PCM.

Also, does the audio have to be sped up or slowed down upon extraction? I extracted them with PSound (don't know if that's good for this or not). It seemed really... off.

Okay, thanks to the great help of Aluigi for making a BMS script to extract the Streams.res archive, here is all of the music for you.

[Shrek The Third](https://mega.nz/#!T41yCKwT!FFXiV1bwRFi13s6tN4Mz_5PDimNpHzMpKWjJcbh_zFg)

All you need to do is run the "Test.bat" file and vgmstream will convert the GENH files into .WAV audio files for you.

Enjoy

Yep, that it is. Uncompressed PCM raw. Just add the extension .raw to it save the following in notepad as a batch file for vgmstream.

```
pause
```

Thanks a lot, I got it! You're awesome. If you don't mind my asking, what is this that Aluigi came up with? Just so I could use it in the future.

This is the script. 
[BMS Script](http://aluigi.altervista.org/papers/bms/others/spiderman_web_shadows.bms)

The game the script was initially written for is different but they share a similar format.

He updated the script to work on these archives as well.
