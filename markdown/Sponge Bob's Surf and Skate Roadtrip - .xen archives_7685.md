- Post Title: Sponge Bob's Surf and Skate Roadtrip - *.xen archives

Hi everyone!

Can somebody help me to write a script for the *.xen files of the new Sponge Bob game? Here are some examples: [http://www.gamefront.com/files/20990532 ... Bob_xen.7z](http://www.gamefront.com/files/20990532/Sponge_Bob_xen.7z)
Seems quite easy but somehow I can't get it to work.
Thanks for your help! 

Regards, Timo
