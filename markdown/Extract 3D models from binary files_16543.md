- Post Title: Extract 3D models from binary files

Hi guys!

Recently I wrote a small tutorial for my program. There is a section in it that briefly describes the structure of 3D formats. Also an example is given of extracting a simple model with a texture. So I decided to create a separate topic in this section.
I think soon the article will expand. If the site does not work, you can download the tutorial in doc format.

Good morning,

The videos are very explicit, but indeed, the tutorial file does not work. Maybe the link has become obsolete after all these years. A little update would be welcome.
