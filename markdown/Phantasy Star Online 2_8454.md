yeah ill add bones this weekend 

its hard to do auto textures because from the files i have extracted it seems random what the texture names are. some times the textures match what is listed in the archives other times they don't also sometimes it seems to be based on the file names.

VCL - pretty much a library precursor to .NETs FCL, since the same guy that created Delphi also created .NET.

its hard to do auto textures because from the files i have extracted it seems random what the texture names are. some times the textures match what is listed in the archives other times they don't also sometimes it seems to be based on the file names.

Maybe it uses an external material library referenced by filename?

Works Perfect, its nice the textures go to the same folder of the model then its not a problem if cant preview in Noesis, thanks to Agrajag and Chroxxx.

The only Think i dont like its something objects have groups of meshes, and Noesis load all like one single object, if u apply the texture you get this.

Yes that its the file, this its 2 options, one its the plugin of noesis atach the 2 or 3 parts of the model to one single mesh, or the model its a single model with multitexture and Noesis Doesnt Support this format.

Something broke with the new update? 



I can view that missile model and some other things with the old plugin, but I get that error with the new one.

That missile one is inside the 53de4e6c7213d7b2b1bb002d6d8e1caf archive.

Ok its fixed in V3 of the script some objects did not have bone maps.

if you have trouble with normals in some programs just comment out this line in the script
rapi.rpgBindNormalBufferOfs(VertBuff, noesis.RPGEODATA_FLOAT, vertSize, vtxeChunkPos
just add # before it
then add a line called pass after it
then noesis will auto generate the correct normals.

Still getting the same error with the V3 Plugin.

Meant to say the 70bd6d80206e2bfd564b935157019e93 Archive for the missile.

Another example is de1c5b8c762da03793501d82603e273a with the Card.

Both of these worked with the first plugin.

After playing around with some PSO2 files. I found out some files like "a map" but dont have texture, just have mesh

 Was this things caused by "deICEr" or the default file structure of PSO2 ?

Another thing is the mesh cannot specify its material. Hoping Chroxx will upload plugin soon 

PS : Anyone know what file is "monster model" ? I tried to research all files "alphabet" but i only found some hair, doodad and effect.

Seriously isn't there a way to batch export with this GUI tool???

Anyone want to add material parsing? It's the TEXF, TSET, and TSTA chunks, though you could probably get away with just parsing the TSET and TEXF.

thats because they updated ice files to v4 
that tool will now only work for ice versions < 4 IE alpha 1, 2 & benchmark
might fix it, might not.
its a bitch working around themidas RISC VM and other crap that goes with it, so if anyone can get an unpacked dump working properly, fixing all anti-dumps etc, it would make it easier, though its not essential, would just push me more towards, will fix it

its a bitch working around themidas RISC VM and other crap that goes with it, so if anyone can get an unpacked dump working properly, fixing all anti-dumps etc, it would make it easier, though its not essential, would just push me more towards, will fix it

I would like to see the textures of the other scenes, because the game is only open two scenes ^^

So has anyone tried adding the additional accessories from the CBT to the Character Creator? the file "ca0214d81e78282b8490d4f91c171c51" is in both so I assume it could be possible.

Most of them are compressed, from what I'm seeing. Judging from the fact that there's a sega lz77 decompress file that's probably it. They are also encrypted with sega's custom blowfish apparently

fuck it, here, have it. i didnt want to play cat & mouse with ST, (what they did with v4 was pretty overkill, some encrypted 3 times some twice & compressed) but you can have it. if anyone is any good with a debugger help agra over at psumods to get the client to accept modded files (for the translation) i cant, i dont have internet access or the client, and to be honest at this point i really dont care that much until it gets released.

[http://depositfiles.com/files/1qmmgxv6d](http://depositfiles.com/files/1qmmgxv6d)

it probably has bugs, i cant remember i havent touched it for months, as i dont have the src, it on my mates lappy.

you may or may not require this for the multi extractor again i cant remember.

name it MD5_PLAINTEXT.txt and put it in the same folder as the deICEr.exe

New error I got with a wired lance model that didn't happen with the first plugin. (ad8de0631c3b36da954b8b8d550b87a3)

I am using the latest version.

Great work, I always loved to see some of the models from the game .

Is possible to make the animations exportable too? are those with the AQM extension?

Hello,

Firstly, a big thanks for this plugin, which is what made me register here.

But, well... That isn't exactly all what I've to tell...

I'd like to know if chrrox will continue to work on it.
I've "datamined" the PC version of the "PSO2 PS Vita CβT" client, and I've found inside some new files. Especially the 3D model contained in the "d22b2fb321131422145d53db951c5b39" file, which makes Noesis crash randomly without apparent reason :
[](http://image.noelshack.com/fichiers/2013/04/1358730696-en-draber-a-l1-aqo-01.png) [](http://image.noelshack.com/fichiers/2013/04/1358730692-en-draber-a-l1-aqo-02.png)
[This is the file](http://www.speedyshare.com/CdR2b/d22b2fb321131422145d53db951c5b39), in case of you'd like to verify if SEGA has changed something in their way to code the game...

The second, and last, things I've to ask for is related to the way I can apply textures to models. On some screenshots posted previously, we can see that can be done directly under Noesis. I'd like to know if it still can be done like that, and how. I've tried to do that too, without success. I also must mention that I know almost nothing about "models manipulation", and haven't any software dedicated to that. So if someone could explain me in a simple way, or redirect me to a tutorial, how can I visualize textured models under Noesis or an other freeware (like Blender, although I'd prefer something more "user friendly"), it would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks !

Edit :
I found out how to do with Blender :

I feel dumb...

But if it's possible to automatically apply textures on a fresh loaded 3D model, I am interested...

I'm also using the deICEr (.v4) posted on the top of this page, and I've never encountered a single problem under Windows 7 or Windows 8 64 bits. That said, I don't have any additional files with this tool : although I don't think they can make the program crash, you should try to launch it without any *.txt files.

Yup. Once you have "deICEd" PSO2's file contained the 3D model which interest you and opened it with Noesis (thanks to the chrrox plugin), You have to export it (as *.obj without any option works fine for me). Then, with Blender, you can import it (File → Import → Wavefront OBJ File). What I do before that is to erease every default items present on a new file : press A two times then del.

And to apply texture(s), I just drag the *.dds file(s) directly onto the 3D model under Blender (just be sure to be on editing mode, not on preview and to don't have every object selected). Usually, there's only one texture that must be applied on every object, but complexe models (like My Room, lobbies decorations, some monsters/weapons, etc...) have multiple textures.

As for the render, I don't know yet how to get it "smooth". For the majority of models it isn't a problem, but for some of them...
[](http://image.noelshack.com/fichiers/2013/06/1360031315-lillipa.png)


Ah ! And if you want to save your textured models without to have to keep the PSO2 extracted files, don't forget to pack into *.blend files the external data.

I found most of the files here, it seems that there ranges from 9-12 files in each set, they go up via number at the start and then run into the alphabet so instead of going from say 1 to 99, it goes from a to f in the alphabet and then the list stops, I had to check my list slowly to find some of them as I had missed the odd one or two.



Some of the textures have flipped UVW`s and incorrect scaling, just requires some messing around in 3ds to fix them.

Mainly the swords, breakers, gigushs, Claymore and Caliburs.I've started to list everything, but I haven't finished (I stopped to do this about 2000 files before the end, and before the PSV update), and, honestly... I'm unsure to resume this work. Or, at least, not immediately.

Anyway, here's a list of files you should explore, although it's incomplete, and not up to date :

If you'd like to get an accurate and up to date list of swords, it's easy : deICE every files, and then research the "wp_*_r.aqo" files.
Swords are the following ones :
wp_xx_01_xx_xx_xx_r.aqo

It's :
 - 01 for sword
 - 02 for wired lance
 - 03 for partisan
 - 04 for twin dagger
 - 05 for double saber
 - 06 for knuckle
 - 07 for gunslash
 - 08 for assault riffle
 - 09 for (grenade) launcher
 - 10 for twin machinegun
 - 11 for rod
 - 12 for talis
 - 13 for wand

What I meant is extract every ICE files. Of course, it won't "extract" HCA, CPK, CRID, etc... files   
Just run the deICEr, select "multi" then list the PSO2 data files directory (\SEGA\PHANTASYSTARONLINE2\pso2_bin\data\win32\), check all ICE, choose to extract them all and proceed to it.

That's what I mean, when I do that, it doesn't seem to extra them, unless it puts them somewhere else.
EDIT: It worked, but only for about 23 of them. After that, it crashed. Also, what about Item names? Particularly, the item drop boxes.

Ah ! Sorry.
I've no idea what happens to you. I'm using the deICEr_v4 posted a page earlier, and I don't have any trouble.

About the drop box... You meant drop's icons ? If so...

Maybe some aren't and/or missing ; idk, it isn't something I've double checked.

And for the item names... Not sure what you asked. If you asked if there were a file that contains every item names, as far I know, no, there isn't (I think the game stream item names from the server). And if you asked if there were an item name stored somewhere with this item data, once again, the answer is no. You've to guess it by yourself. Other reason that explain why I've stopped to list datafiles.

Um, is there any way to repack the extracted ICE files? I know the translated files have been repacked somehow, but I can't seem to find any way.

Hello, folks.  Pardon an odd question from a board newbie, but has anyone managed to figure out how the animation files work in PSO2?  If so, can these be translated into a different format, such as a .bvh file or its' ilk?  Thanks to this forum, I've been successfully able to extract and texture models from PSO2, but would dearly love to garner the animations as well in a useable format.

Many many thanks in advance for any answers.

Well, none of them except sn_hikari01.aqo. That's the only one that could be previewed and exported.

Well, none of them except sn_hikari01.aqo. That's the only one that could be previewed and exported.its header says "aqo.VTBF"
Others have "aqo.NIFL" which have a simpler structure so may be extracted using hex2obj:

This one from a while back should extract nearly everything but a few files. 
[https://www.dropbox.com/home/Random/PSO ... CEr_v4.exe](https://www.dropbox.com/home/Random/PSO2?preview=deICEr_v4.exe)

It crashes if it hits maybe 4 or so of the files out of all of them (its not very many at all), but if you separate them out you can get everything aside from those. You'll know which files don't work because it will crash when it tries to extract them after making a folder for it and dumping the first part of it. I used it today to extract essentially everything in the game for the current patch. 

Given how few files don't work with it, I think it should be very possible for you to work with the existing tools, if a little annoying when it crashes on them. There is an extractor that gets the few files that the one I linked doesn't, but you'd have to contact the people who do the English patch for the game since its private.

It's highly unlikely they'll let people use the private tool.

[http://www.mediafire.com/download/f1raj ... CEr_v4.zip](http://www.mediafire.com/download/f1raj3y3akesjr9/deICEr_v4.zip)
This file extractor will extract everything but these files at present:
17cc64bb922e9ef4be897b5c1fd85263
6d853ed891a0ec524ba5ab4a6cf5b667
9f2af7843a769fce9cc4a01d2352b0ba
e59b86227ee26dcd26502a3bc051e34c
fd238cec3dc65d6b573eaf8eb81c78c7
4f78ce7584205cd16b4d83c039690600

If you remove these temporarily from your folder, it will extract all files.

4f78ce7584205cd16b4d83c039690600 is a dummy file, but the other 5 can be extracted with another tool below by dragging them onto ice.exe while they have file extensions (The program tries to create a folder with the same name as the extensionless file which doesn't work):
[http://www.mediafire.com/download/d2pj4 ... _fresh.rar](http://www.mediafire.com/download/d2pj4r0vu041ro3/repacker_fresh.rar)

Hopefully, this is helpful.

Edit: One thing I forgot to mention. Some people report deicer being unstable after a while if it's parsing too much at once so splitting up the files into multiple loads would probably be a good idea.

Hi! I´m new here!
Sorry to write in a old thread, but I really need your help!
(I´m a noob so please don´t be rude...)
My problem is that my Noesis won´t work!
I´m very confused because when I first looking in PSO2 folder(I have only downloaded character creator demo for PSO2)the files don´t have any extensions!
I´m looking in C:/program(x86)/SEGA/PHANTASTARONLINE2_CHARACTERCREATOR/psocharactercreator_ep4_bin/data/win32 and there you have the unknown file extensions files. 
And when using DeICEr and I select all files in that folder I get BIN. files. 
I have repacker fresh (ice.exe,compressed.bat and uncompressed.bat). 
When I drag the file(s) in compressed.bat or uncompressed.bat I get AQO. files, which I believe should work in Noesis with a Plugin.
I´m have tried many times in Noesis but it says: File could not be previewed.
Is anything wrong here?
You may laugh at me, but how do I extract and install Noesis correctly? 
My plan was to convert the files in Noesis to Blender or Milkshape 3D to Wavefront.OBJ.
Thank you in advanced!

(There should be this line contained in the lower listbox in Noesis:
Phantasy Star Online 2 (*.aqo))

But if you had read this thread carefully you should have noticed Ayumi's remark in his post as of  Sat Jun 13, 2015 5:47 pm.

So watch out for the file headers and read this thread again.

It seems that I don´t have that plugin!
How do I get it?
I have read through the whole thread but I can´t figure it out. 
When I download chroxx zip file I only get 1 file: aqp.py.
Is that the only file I need?

if it's from 4th of March, 2012 with a size of 11kB then 'yes'

There should be these two lines contained:

```
	handle = noesis.register("Phantasy Star Online 2", ".aqo")
```


It's also checking for aqo type:

```
		return 0
```
(does the file start with 'aqo'?)
So if your aqo doesn't meet this condition then the file can't be previewed.

It has to be the wrong file...
There was only one file in the zip folder with the size of only 3kB.
And that name was aqp.py.
I can´t see the date the plugin was created.
Excuse my ignorance.
This make me rather confused.

There was only one file in the zip folder with the size of only 3kB.unzipped size?
If 'no' search this thread for the py script or google for it.

Also, please, read this thread again to understand that even if you have the latest version of that script it will fail to load some aqo files because something has to be updated before (deICEr?, whatever).

Oh! 
I think I got it now!
Sorry to bother you more, but it has to be that I just have the character creator demo?   
I should have told you that before, but thanks anyway!   
Do I have to download the full game and then extract the files to Noesis?
I will look into that later when I get some sleep.
Well, the zipped folder we were talking about, I looked into that in 7zip-archive and there was only one file there.

I think I made some improvement but some problems still remains.
I get some errors:
Noesis Python Error
Traceback(most recent call last):

RuntimeError: Tries to set offset beyond buffer size. (1146271766 > 291540)

Noesis also say the model cannot be reviewed but maybe still can be exported.
And when I try to export to Wavefront.OBJ I get the same message and the export fails!

And this error:
Traceback(most recent call last)

FaceOff = psetOffset(0) + 18
IndexError: list index out of range

What does this mean?

What does this mean?it means that the plugin has to be updated - but without the model file in question there's no chance

Okay, it seems that many of the links in this thread is deleted or invalid+some pictures is deleted too.
I have been searching everywhere in this thread! 
I feel so dumb but where do you find the fmt_phantStarOnl2.py???
I can´t really find it! 
Sorry, but as I may have said: I´m a noob, I don´t know where to look!   
I feel very stupid!
I don´t know if that against the rules, but if someone can be kind enough and upload it on mediafire I would be so happy!
Because, I can´t really find it in this thread!
And what do you mean with the plugin being updated(sorry to ask you...), do you mean aqp.py or fmt_phantStarOnl2.py?
And the model file?
Should I upload a file that you can see if the file is corrupted or extracted in the wrong way?
Because, I have no clue what´s the problem right now!
I think it has to do with the missing fmt_phantStarOnl2.py file.
(Which I really can´t find...  )

there is no script file by that name in this thread, the Noesis script is in the first post and it looks like you already have it.
some nonworking samples are needed if the script is to be updated by someone.

(sorry, my bad, seems I renamed that apq5.py when I downloaded it years ago to give its name more sense.)

> if the script is to be updated by someone.Except that workaround for files with "aqo.NIFL" in the header (which I mentioned some posts above) there's no "improvement" I could think of, to be honest.

Feel free to ask your questions in this thread: [viewtopic.php?f=29&t=10894](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=29&t=10894)
but I'm NOT a trainer.

Hello.
I have been tried Hex2Obj for a whole day and I can say my autistic brain feels completely exhausted...
Sadly, I don´t think I´m doing right in Hex2Obj.   
I have been fiddling around with the numbers in a Hexeditor but can´t seem to get it right.
Shakotay, you say that there´s no "recipe" on how to sucess in Hex2obj, I fully understand what you mean by that. 
But, I really want to get this mesh to import it to Blender and later to Sims 3! 
That would be awesome! 
Are there other ways to suceed than this way other than HEXediting?
I feel my dumb autistic brain won´t make it! 
Here´s a link I think might work for me(the only problem I get no Wavefront OBJ output files from this method)[http://www.pso-world.com/forums/showthr ... g-Tutorial](http://www.pso-world.com/forums/showthread.php?232836-PSO2-Modding-Tutorial)
And here´s a newer link: [http://www.pso-world.com/forums/showthr ... torial-2-0](http://www.pso-world.com/forums/showthread.php?237103-PSO2-Modding-Tutorial-2-0)
My main project is to convert the Vocaloid models including Hatsune Miku whole set, Kagamine Rin/Len Whole set and Megurine Luka whole set.
I really hope you can help me in some way, I would relly appriciate it!
Thank you in advanced!
