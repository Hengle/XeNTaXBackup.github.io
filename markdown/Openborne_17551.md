Openborne

Hello XeNTaX. I am working on a project with 3 other people called Openborne. It is a complete OpenGL re-implementation of Bloodborne. It is meant to be cross-platform so it will work on most mainstream operating systems that support OpenGL and SDL such as Windows, Mac, Linux etc. [Click here to go to the project page](http://github.com/openborne). So far we have been able to parse DCX, TXT and BND4 files. We are currently working on parsing FLV/FLVER files and TPF files. They seem to have a more unique format as opposed to the Dark Souls equivalents. We have a small OpenGL template setup, so we can easily draw models onto the screen afterwards.

We also invite you all to share your knowledge or learn more on [our Discord](https://discord.gg/wJjUq7R)!
Thanks for reading

Yes, I have seen some projects like yours, but all ended their cancellations, since original developers contacted persons in charge and told them to stop working on it. 
If you'll play a low profile and make it as private project, they might not notice.
Otherwise you'll be told to stop, since you actually don't own any right to use their assets.
You can get rights by contacting them/publisher directly, but chance that they give you any is extremly low.
