- Post Title: Need help please. Elite Dangerous

Ok so in Elite Dangerous we found this thing called Unknown Artifact. 

Its an object makes a bunch of sounds and such then it explodes. 

From testing we figured out it Collects the local system data and when its making its sounds in it is morse code for system name, star, and planet.  All the rest of the sounds are just sounds and no meaning. 

I am new to this I did figure out how to get the sound files for the UNknown Artifact. 

I am now trying to study the code for the model itself.

The files are
data.ovi
Data.ovs.models_l0
Data.ovs.models_l1
Data.ovs.textures_l0

I am new to this stuff but find it really interesting. 

I need some help I am just starting out on this. 
I just learned Hexadecimal well started to I got the basics of that.


We are sure the sound part must have to access the servers for the system your in info to get the name, stars, planets your in. Or at least be access that data on your computer system in a temp file of some kind. 

What i am trying to do is see if can figure out what they are and what they are doing through the games code. We have a guess it has something to do with an alien race thargoids that havnt been introduced into the game yet. 


Please help thanks
