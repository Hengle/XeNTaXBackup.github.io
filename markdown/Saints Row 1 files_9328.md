Hi,

I looked at your .rar file you have SR1 and SR2 files in there for mutile formats. I am guessing you just want the textures regardless of console.
Checkout this SR Wiki it has a link to a whole lot of tools, i tried to run them but my system is 64-bit and it didn't seem to like them, try on a 32-Bit OS.

Thanks for looking. These files are Xbox 360 version, so I have trouble extracting

By the way. Does anyone know some brute-force extractor than Dragon Unpacker?
