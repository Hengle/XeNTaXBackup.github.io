I've been wondering when someone was gonna start ripping this game apart.
I'm interested in this too.
I finished it the day it was released (i pre-ordered it so i got it 3 days before it was released omg i was so happy), n now I've gone over it again and gotten all the face camo except the colonel one...cos how the hell do i get that, got a bunch other stuff gonna go over it on extreme today too (god it'll kill me i just know it will).

One question...HOW did u manage to rip the entire game onto ur PC....and ontop of that...ist a 50gig game...how can u use up 50gig with a buncha stuff u cant yet use.

Unfortunately retail encryption has not been cracked yet.  i don't know of anyone who has a debug/test system along with a debug/demo version of this game, as currently that seems to be the only way to get unencrypted files from a game.  i would definitely like to get my hands on some unencrypted files from this game to compare against what i have so far for Metal Gear Solid 2 and 3.  Oh well, a lot of waiting it seems before that will occur.

You have files from MGS3?

I started on that game with ripping aaaages ago and the header for the stage.dat got decrypted by turfster but then he dissapeared and I kinda gave up due to work and other things.

I wouldnt mind seeing what you have from that game, if you dont mind sharing anything of course.
