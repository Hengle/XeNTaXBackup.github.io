Very nice, I especially like the first and the last one, but then, I come from the C64 days, perhaps that is of influence!  

Did you use Photoshop or something else?

I think a skinning feature would be a nice touch, and even perhaps considered a feature when you look at the fact that MexCom works primarily with games...

Another idea would be having all (or most) of the resources for mexcom in an archive, which mexcom will support with extracting and importing.

Actually, the DOS version of MultiEx Commander had a set-up exe and a setup.sad file that contained all the resources. 

(See also [http://filext.com/detaillist.php?extdetail=SAD](http://filext.com/detaillist.php?extdetail=SAD) )

One of the archives supported in the DOS version : SadCom Ltd. .SAD files.

not to be rude or anything, but I HATE fonts that you can't tell the difference between 0(Zero) and O(Capital Letter O), and 1(Number 1) and l(Small Letter L).

Cool, I've never seen that record... When did you find out it was listed? (or did you perhaps submit it yourself?  )
