- Post Title: Crysis3.xml for music.pak?

Does anyone have this .xml for scripting the music files? I have the music, but not this file, as was the case with the rip of Crysis 2. It will do a great job of identifying unnamed tracks, such as the fight music.

Please upload if one of you have this?

Thanks in advance...
