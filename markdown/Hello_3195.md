- Post Title: Hello

Hello all, 

I'm new here at Xentax.  I actually came across this forum during a google search (though the actual search escapes me).  The page that I was directed to actually caught my interest.  It was something about the Star Wars Galaxies MGN files.  I then decided to check out what Xentax was all about.  When I learned that it is a game research forum, I decided to join up.  I am currently attending classes to get a BA in Game Art & Design.  I am looking to begin modding something to add to my portfolio and thought this would be a good place to be a member of.

I also wanted to post to see if anyone would be able to assist me.  After reading the thread my search led me to, I can now tell that my one of my goals can actually come true.  I knew there was an attempt to build an emulator for SWG, but I also know that it isnt completed.  Up until I discovered this page, I was unaware that anyone was able to extract the 3D models from the game.  If someone could explain the process of extracting the MGN or MSH files from the game I would be greatful.  My eventual goal is to take these 3D files from the game and build higher poly models from them for use in a project that I am working on (non-game related, but still SWG-related).  

Over the past few months I have taken some of my free time and began modeling buildings and ships from Star Wars Galaxies.  While modeling them from scratch is possible, I feel I could get much more done in a shorter amount of time if I had low-poly models to begin with (Not to mention being able to keep each model in scale with each other).

Thanks for listening!

Joe

Maybe its me... but when I try to run 3D Ripper I cant get it to launch SWG.  Maybe because SWG uses the Sony launchpad to launch, but I cant seem to get 3D ripper and SWG to work together.  Anyone out here that has successfully used 3D ripper with SWG, please let me know how you got it to work.  Thanks.

if you try the GLOBAL MONITOR button it should not care about a launcher. IT injects itself to the game after the launcher is done
