Anyone else having trouble extracting the .TFC files?
I'm using updated umodel with -game=hunt -extract -all but I keep getting:

ERROR: zlib uncompress() returned -3
appDecompress <- DecompressBlock:block=18+1ABD <- FUE3ArchiveReader::PrepareBuffer <- FUE3ArchiveReader::Serialize <- FArchive::ByteOrderSerialize <- FPackageFileSummary<<:Ver=0/0 <- UnPackage::UnPackage:TEXTURES.UPK, game=0 <- UnPackage::LoadPackage:G:\Textures\Hunted\TEXTURES.UPK <- Main

Yet the umodel forum seems to say that everything is fine.

You can't extract .TFC files. They are used when uViewer exports.
