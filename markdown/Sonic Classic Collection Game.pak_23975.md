- Post Title: Sonic Classic Collection Game.pak

We're trying to figure out how to extract the Genesis ROMs within the Sonic Classic Collection, both the US and European releases. Both releases have 7 ROMs in them; Sonic The Hedgehog, Sonic the Hedgehog 2, Sonic the Hedgehog 3, Sonic & Knuckles, Sonic & Knuckles + Sonic The Hedgehog, Sonic & Knuckles + Sonic The Hedgehog 2, and Sonic & Knuckles + Sonic The Hedgehog 3. The problem is that the Game.pak file likely containing the ROMs has no header as far as we can tell, there's no documentation on how to extract it (probably because it's obscure proprietary bullshit), and we have no experience working with this stuff. Can anyone help us out with this? Thanks in advance! ~Red

Here's a copy of the US release's Game.pak file [https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/ ... 0/Game.pak](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/493153242104987669/847566234051543110/Game.pak)

There some guy, that manage to dump ROMs through RAM. Maybe you can ask him what he knows about your problem.

We're trying to verify the ROMs by dumping them from the .pak, though we have tried dumping them from RAM and it doesn't seem to be working, though we'll try an alternate method of dumping the RAM soon. The guy's a dick though, and I don't trust him for a second (especially since he didn't release the unmodified combined ROMs [i.e. Sonic The Hedgehog 3 + Sonic & Knuckles]), just modified copies. . ~Charlie
