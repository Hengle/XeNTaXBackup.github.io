- Post Title: The Humains EXP file.

Hi guys, can someone tell me how can i edit *.exp files from The Humans Game. I've attached english language file from this game packed in rar archive.

EDIT: Hexeditor will do but unfortunately I can't use all words I need 'cause it will have to be same characters number as oryginal word.
