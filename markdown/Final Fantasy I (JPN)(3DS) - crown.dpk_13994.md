- Post Title: Final Fantasy I (JPN)(3DS) - crown.dpk

Hey Guys,

I just got a copy of Final Fantasy I (JPN) for the Nintendo 3DS and want to decrypt the game.
So I found the crown.dpk inside of the romfs.
Unfortunately I'm not able to extract/rebuild this file format :/
I've uploaded this file here: [https://mega.nz/#!pl8nkAAS!Wj7fa6Ro-yid ... wwaFOAh75E](https://mega.nz/#!pl8nkAAS!Wj7fa6Ro-yidmx1NXuR38mv6D1b0JQBwswwaFOAh75E)

This is the header:

> FF 09 00 00 00 B1 AB 06 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00

Could someone check this file format and probably make a simple extractor/rebuild-tool?

THank you very much!

The File looks like this:

Doesn't work. Tried it already but the Files seems to be different.

Well, this script works pefectly 
Is there a way to modify/extract&Rebuild the .PCK-Files? And Is there a way to rebuild the dpk-file?

Uploaded some of the PCK-Files (WP16 header? probably the compression)
