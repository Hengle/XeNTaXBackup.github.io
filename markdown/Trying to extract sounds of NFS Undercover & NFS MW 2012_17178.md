Hey,

Recently I try to extract desesperately all sounds of NFS Undercover & NFS MW 2012 but after hours of search, I found nothing. There is very old topics about this subjects but found nothing.

There is a tool that exist who can extract sounds from there games ?
I want to extract .BNDL, .tmx, .sci, and .ABK files.
I tried with ealayer3.exe but it fail, it can't.

If you want I can put some files...

And sorry for my poor english, i'm french.
