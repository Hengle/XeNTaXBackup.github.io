Hi, I am looking for anyone that can assist me with hex editing Command & Conquer 3 Kanes wrath for the 360. I really enjoy the game and would like to make it better by modding it. I do not have the knowledge to hex edit . I have searched everywhere and have yet to find anything, I have tried sevensins, gametuts, and various other sites with no luck. 

If anyone would help me I would greatly appreciate it. I am looking for the ability to play online, as well as skirmish and all other game modes. Specifically looking to have it where there are instant building placements, instant units and by instant I mean no wait for having to build structures or train units. I am also interested in having unlimited resources with all upgrades and all powers at the ready without the cooldown.
