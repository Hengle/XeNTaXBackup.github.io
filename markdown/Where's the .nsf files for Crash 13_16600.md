Hi, I'm new to this site, and I found out you can hack Crash 1/3, But I need the .nsf files to hack the game. Does anyone have some .nsf files for Crash 1/3 up, I'm really excited to do it!

If you have ISO of the game, you can unpack contents using CDMage, edit unpacked .nsf files by CrashEdit and then pack it again with CDMage.
