Hi all!

Just wanted to make a formal thread and say hi to you all. This looks to be a really nice place to discuss 3d models and how to de-mystify all those model files that are out there.

For the past 3 years i have ripped alot of games using various 3d rippers and extractors. I love collecting 3d models and look how they where made. So far it has gone quite ok and i have almost been able to rip from all games that i like. These are often korean mmorpg (and other) games like:

Sword of the new world
Lineage 2
Cabal online
Soul of ultimate nation and so on

What all of these have in commin is really nice looking models.

recently the security for online games have increased with hackshield and such so sometimes 3d ripper is canceled witch leave me without models. This forum tackles the problem from another view witch compells me. You can get models that are later in the game so you actually dont have to play it 

Last year i bought an 3d engine and i love to play around with it. My goal is just to learn how to make games and i prefer to use already made models because i can more quickly set up a map and some models and just play around.

My hopes is that in this forum i can access more models and maybe even some animations. Can you maybe recommend something where there are model + animation? I for example have seen the game ROHAN ONLINE witch has exactly the same animation as Lineage2, total ripoff.

I want to be able to help in some way but my coding experience basicall like this:

```
20 goto 10
loop
end
```


And not even that will work 

I am learning angelscript because the engine uses that so maybe i will be a quick learner.

Well, thats all from me for now

Thanks for reading

This is a totally new world but it's really interesting. Hope i can learn stuff later on.

The only thing i have done before is memory hacking and i once was able to make a trainer but that is all
