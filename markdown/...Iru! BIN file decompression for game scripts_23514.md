- Post Title: ...Iru! BIN file decompression for game scripts

Good day everyone!

I'm a hobbyist trying to learn how various game files can be compressed/decompressed in order to get a better understanding of how they work. 

The game "...Iru!" is my first project, and unfortunately I'm struggling to wrap my mind around how the game's scripts are compressed and how I can decompress them. As far as I can tell, the game's scripts are stored in various BIN files pertaining to each "area" of the game, and from what research I have been able to do, I've gathered that it's possibly LZSS compression.

That where I'm stuck. Since I'm new to all of this, I'm having difficulty finding any apparent patterns in the file to help me write a script to decompress  it and if anyone on here could help me crack the code, that would be greatly appreciated!!

Here is a link to a sample file: [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Uwm-VE ... sp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Uwm-VEeatVbiAfmpM5cxen0a1SQRo5tw/view?usp=sharing)

Any insight would be more than amazing!!! Thanks again!!

EDIT: I almost forgot! I believe the files are also Shift-JIS encoded.
