Hello guys, well as I can see I unpack files of new Cabal 2 Online, anyway the engine used for this game is CryEngine 3, my question is if somebody can take a look of files, I can't import into Max, so well maybe somebody can take a view because i'm confused with some formats of this game, ok hope somebody can give me a hand, many thanks for support.

Yes, I can confirm that Noesis+Reveal8n plugin and all models you provided works great. BTW, can you share download link to download client? Thanks

Here is the part he share.

```
struct Res_Table {
 dword ChunkID
 dword ChunkVer
 dword ChunkOffset
 dword ChunkIndex
 dword ChunkSize
} 


```


PD: please chrox, if you can take a look and modify it really gratefull.

I downloaded new client, and bms script works great for it. I guess, you're using not latest version of QuickBMS, file samples in this thread extracted fine for me too.
