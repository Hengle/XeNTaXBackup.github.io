- Post Title: Model links collection on wiki

[http://wiki.xentax.com/index.php/Model_Import_Plugins](http://wiki.xentax.com/index.php/Model_Import_Plugins)

Will have a bunch of links to topics in the 3D models forum.
I made it cause it was too hard to find scripts to look at.

EDIT: I've added some links from the first 5 pages (I probably should've started at the end). I only looked at the thread-starter and assumed everyone else either posted requests or links to existing tools. Maybe my method of filtering threads is too biased.

chrrox, szk, Mariokart, howfie, revelation, and...some others.
