what is the name of the game from which the samples came?   

the archive looks similar to one here and you can use the same extraction and conversion method 
[viewtopic.php?p=132267#p132267](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?p=132267#p132267)

things to focus on in that post:
nxpk bms script
the extension rename script posted there
Mali Texture Compression tool
