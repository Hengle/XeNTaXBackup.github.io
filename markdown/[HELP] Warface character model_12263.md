- Post Title: [HELP] Warface character model

Hi everyone, i`m new member.

Anyone try to import CHR file to 3DS MAX ? I extracted some AI character from Warface PAK, then i tried open CHR file directly by 3DS MAX but it's failed. CryEngine plugin for 3DS MAX doesn't include import function.

How to import CHR to 3DS MAX ?

Thanks for help
