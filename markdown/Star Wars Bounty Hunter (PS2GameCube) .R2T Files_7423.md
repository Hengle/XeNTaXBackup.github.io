- Post Title: Star Wars Bounty Hunter (PS2/GameCube) .R2T Files

Hello!

I'm new here, so please forgive me if I'm not requesting this in the correct forum. I don't have any experience with this kind of thing, so please be gentle! 

"Star Wars Bounty Hunter" was released in 2002 for the PS2 and GameCube. I have popped the PS2 disc in my PC and looked at the files. I'm interested in extracting any/all graphics or images I can get from the game. 

I'm particularly interested in the 110 images that are included in a concept art gallery in the game. 

Here's where the images are on the PS2 disc:

DATA > IFACE > FRONTEND > CONCEPT 

In the "concept" folder, there are 12 folders, named "GROUP01" through "GROUP12." It seems like there are 3 files for each image, interspersed in these folders. I would assume that they are the image itself, then perhaps the border, and maybe the navigation buttons. They have the file extension R2T. 

Any other images that could be ripped from the disc would be awesome. I would love to grab some of the material used to put together the menu screens too. 

If anyone can point me in the right direction, or help me out here....I would appreciate it. Thanks!!!
