- Post Title: Era of legends models

Hello, I was reviewing this game and I was able to extract the models and textures, but I was trying to extract the mesh with its armature in .dae or .fbx format with AssetsBundleExtractor and AssetStudio respectively, but I could not, in case of the .dae format it loads but the armature has no bones. Hope someone can give a look to the model, to see where I'm failing.    . Thanks!

In the manifest file you could check the Assets / Surface / Res / horse / H_zhizhu / H_zhizhu_Action_bone.prefab
and when you load in assetstudio there appear the bones used by the model also in Assets / Surface / Res / horse / H_zhizhu / H_zhizhu_body_m2b.txt it appears all the bones and their respective weight.
