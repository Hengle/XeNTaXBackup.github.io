- Post Title: I had a major accident

For anyone that knows me, I had a really bad accident in my truck.  I had to get 9 staples in my head, the head wound was about 4 inches, and I lost alot of blood in the accident.  The hospital and people that found me at the accident scene saved me from a far worse fate.

Here are some pics of my head:




I have really bad memory loss and forget things short term, can't even remember the accident or how it happened.  Just wanted to let people aware of what happened with me.

They gave me a catscan and after they stapled my head up, they released me from the hospital.  I go to my regular doctor sometime this week, my wife knows the appt, I don't remember when it is supposed to be.  I feel really worthless and crappy right now.
