- Post Title: Help needed with model

Hi, can anyone help a newbie out.
I've managed so far to get this file and want to 3Dprint a 20cm model I need to make a .obj or .stl file, but for the life of me I cant seem to do it, always errors in the file(holes etc)   any ideas or advice or help would be much appreciated this is the first time I've done this so need all the help I can get. I used ninja ripper to get the data.
link to the model data is below.
