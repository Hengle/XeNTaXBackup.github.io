Hey guys! Sooo, long story short I made tools for For Honor game models/textures. Actually, ported some into Fallout 76 already.

They only problem, recent - latest client versions are encrypted, plus game is using denuvo has anti-hack system etc, so no way I can  get anything from them xD  Maybe, there are ppl, who made a backup and have more older clients (very end of 2017 - 2018) without encryption. So, if you have one, please send me PM. Thanks in advance!

Thanks for the tip!  Much appreciated (this will be useful info for many other games too), this DB has client which would be perfect for me, though for some reason it's not downloading xD I guess, they deleted this depot (developers) already, so if anyone has For Honor - Open Test: Marching Fire (For Honor – Breach Test Content 22.39 GiB) client, let me know

I think, now thanks to friend I have client from oct 05 2017, which was almost 49gb in size. This is very good, it's has 16 heroes! And a lot of stuff like ornaments and different title updates, so more content   Something perfect would be to obtain client, first release of beta Marching Fire, it will add +4 heroes, so it will be 20 heroes!!! and huge amount of content, because it was huge update even with arcade mode. On steam DB it's depot is showing but not working xD

Greetings, I was wondering if there is any update on this? Getting a model of Lawbringer has eluded me for as long as the game has been out and I'd love to obtain it. Any information is appreciated!

how did you manage to port those models to fallout 76? could you possibly use ninjaripper to rip the ported models from fallout 76 to for example blender or maya?  also any progress by any chance? its my dream to be able to 3d print my favourite heros from for honor

Hey! Why I should use ninjaripper in FO76 in order to rip For Honor models, which I by myself ported into there lol?! I made some tools for client which was released in the end of 2017. There 18 heroes are present (or 16?!) Not sure, all models with bones and weights and their textures I could obtain without problem. The problem is, that my tools are working only for this client and you can't download it from anywhere anymore, I can't re-upload it ATM because I have very slow uploading speed (tried several times and big forges 3-4gb in size are failing to upload), so this game is on a PAUSE for now, maybe someone will dercypt latest client. Then I'll just update what I have for it (if needed), and post it on xentax, it's a plan for now.

I tried  of course  Not working, well... partially working. It decrypts beginning of the .forge (table of content (files sizes, offsets)), everything else same encrypted data byte by byte!

Hey, I’m not one for ripping myself and I see the post is still fresh, so I wanted to ask, I believe I saw your YouTube channel and was very curious if you still have all the files for the for honor characters, seeing as you switched to Warhammer 40k, I love that by the way, gotta love terminators, but I digress, I wanted to know if I could get the files and or models, been dying to make some for Vrchat but they are nearly impossible to find, if not, completely fine, not gonna waste anymore time, I’m simply curious.

Would it be possible for anybody to rip the models from here?

A decrypted 2018 installation of For Honor surfaces.
I have the unpacked files uploaded here [https://mega.nz/folder/bf4HUSzY#f-VRaN10CnD-eE0rH4_rMA](https://mega.nz/folder/bf4HUSzY#f-VRaN10CnD-eE0rH4_rMA)
Zaramot has been largely unavaliable to look into them, so it will be down to someone else to investigate them for conversion.
