I've written an application which does this for you. It works with the ps2,wii and xbox 360 pac files. I've also posted tutorials. Check out my site for more info: [http://sf4mods.blogspot.com](http://sf4mods.blogspot.com)

Sorry for double post. Another request: how can i convert .txc files to something editable?
I know about header changing, but it's to complicate  
There is other way?

My app does this for you as well. Select export instead of extract and it'll convert to the editable tm2 format.

don't open the txc file directly in the app. Open the the texture archive and export the files from there. Go through the tutorials on my site for more info.
