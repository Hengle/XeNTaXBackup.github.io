- Post Title: Aura Kingdom new open pkg

Good afternoon, an update with new models has been released in the game Kingdom of Aura
The plugin that helped open the .pkg archives works fine, but some of the models do not work correctly, most of the non-working models are new models that were added to the update and which I would like to receive
Could you suggest or find a solution to this problem
sorry for my English
