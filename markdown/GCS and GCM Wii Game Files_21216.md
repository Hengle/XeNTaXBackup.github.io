- Post Title: GCS and GCM Wii Game Files

Although it sucks, the one thing that Rudolph game for Wii got right was models. I've been checking out the files lately to see what I can find, only to see it's full of gcs and gcm files. I've looked it up, and it seems like these filetypes are used in a fair bit of other games, but I haven't seen anything that can extract them. Anyone up for a challenge?

Here's some samples. I've also included a pair of gcs/gcm files from a Dora Wii game, since they seem to use the same type and same engine, in case you want to compare. I quickly compared the one from each game in a hex editor, and they both look pretty similar.
