Has anyone looked into this? There's a bms scripts which can unpack the *.pak files for crysis 2 and crysis 3, but it doesn't work with this game. Looking at the files, it looks like the basic format is the same but maybe the compression scheme used is different [http://rghost.net/44346840](http://rghost.net/44346840)
