Hi,

I found a Blender python script that imports the rigged models for this game, but unfortunately it doesn't support the *.animation files.
Then I tried Fat Importer for Max because it seemed to support this format (Legendary Champions uses similar BigWorld Engine extensions: *.visual, *.primitives, *.anca), but it wasn't able to import the TianYu animations.

I would be very grateful for it, if someone share with us a Blender/Max script that supports animations for this game.   

Bests,
nkms
