- Post Title: Android - Heroes Arena by UCOOL.3D Models

Hello,
I have some experience extracting models with tools made by the awesome internet community. Nevertheless I m trying to figure out how to extract the models from this MOBA. The biggest folder in Android data has like 600 mb and is full of .ddx files. I have already tried to scan those files with Unitystudio, but the program doesn't recognize those files. 

Please help me and thanks in advance.
