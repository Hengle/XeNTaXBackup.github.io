- Post Title: [PSP] 'Digimon Adventure' .GIM files

Hello. 

I'm trying to translate 'Digimon Adventure' for PSP into spanish little by little in my free times, but I don't know how to do something: I can extract the .Gim files from a "packed file" without extension (they go from ID00000 to ID03841) and transformed them into .Png

I can edit them without any problem, but what I don't know how to do is to "repack" them again, make the IDXXXXX file complete again.

I'm using 'TextER' to extract the Gim files, but when I try to "repack" them it says that the new edited file's size is not the same.


Can somebody help me please? Thank you, and sorry for my bad english x)
