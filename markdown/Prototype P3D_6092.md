Yes, I am also interested in these models, but P3D archive is too complex. 
I've seen topic related to P3D files, and it is old - I don't think that someone could do something. Sorry!

Thank you very much for the information. In another thread I found a tool - P3D structure viewer - it shows structure contained in a P3D file and lists names for types of sections. You can save any kind of section of P3D file with this tool. Maybe somebody will extract meshes in such a way? And then make converter or importer? Thanks in advance.

All my attempts to get models from Prototype were unsuccessful. 
I'll pay money to anyone who can get model of the main character T-Pose with proper UV's!
If anyone can help please write here or send me PM. Thanks!
