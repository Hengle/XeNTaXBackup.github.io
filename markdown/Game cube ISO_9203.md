- Post Title: Game cube ISO

Been looking around for information on unpacking game cube ISO's but haven't found anything useful beyond "unpack the rar file, then burn it to a disc. Congratulations!"

Are there any standards for GC stuff or tools that I can try?
The file starts with the ID of the game, but I'm guessing most GC disks are like that.

The Dolphin emulator can view the file systems for Wii/GameCube games. Just set up a folder for the game(s), set that path up in Dolphin, and right-click the game you want to export files from and click "Properties". The "Filesystem" tab has the contents of the ISO, right-click a file and choose "Extract File", or "Extract All Files" if you want to unpack everything.

That's pretty convenient. No need for separate unpackers lol

[VGMToolbox](http://sourceforge.net/projects/vgmtoolbox/) has an ISO extractor included.  It can unpack GC/WII (with ckey.bin) as well.  

It has plenty of formats included: "GameCube, Green Book (CD-i), ISO 9660 (PSX/PS2), NullDC GDI (Dreamcast), Opera FS (3DO), Wii Optical Disc, XDVDFS (XBOX/XBOX360)" at the time of this post.

Just open Misc. Tools > Extraction Tools > Generic > ISO Extractor

Oh, that's a lot of consoles. Looks like something nice to have around.
