- Post Title: Help me convert tex and ctex to jpg

Hello,

please everyone who can help me. I would like to extract jpg or png textures from Fluidity wii ware game and Fluidity spin cycle 3DS. They are in .ctex and .tex format and I tried almost everything, but I can't open them as an image. Can someone with experience help me convert these files to an image? I am sending a link where you can download these files, please help me.

Hi,

Converting .ctex and .tex files to images might require specialized tools. You could try using texture extraction tools that are specific to the Fluidity game formats.
