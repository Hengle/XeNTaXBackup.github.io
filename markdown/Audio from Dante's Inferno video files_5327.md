- Post Title: Audio from Dante's Inferno video files

Anyone knows how to extract it (and possibly convert it if needed to play it back)?

I extracted the game's files: [viewtopic.php?f=10&t=5326](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=5326)
And I found out that the video files are those that in hex begin with "MVhd ...vp60"
I have converted these files with "EA's Video & Audio Decoder" but I get no audio.

The following ~ 38MB archive includes: [http://www.multiupload.com/KQHG4NDWIP](http://www.multiupload.com/KQHG4NDWIP)
the eaconv.exe and a .cmd for easy conversion
sample.vp6 a ~ 22MB extracted from the game
sample.avi a ~ 16,5MB video file converted from the above vp6 file with the help of eaconv.exe

Thanks!
