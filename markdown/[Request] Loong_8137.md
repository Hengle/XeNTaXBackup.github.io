WUT?
I can't see any encryption or compression, in fact all I can see are header data, floats, and triangle lists.
Even opening it in notepad shows you the materials ie. data\model\weapon\c01\C01_1.tga
(i'd get new friends)

Looks fairly easy... must be if I can see it.
Surely someone has converted this already!!!

well so I think need resign :/, I like this game, and here we have a good ppl, with great skills but nothing respond my topic just you and Ninja, and in this case him say is really easy format so why is something easy nobody do before a bms Script? anyway thanks a lot for try Rimbros you're welcome.

lol ya I see the same things that ninja sees. I think your friends might be trying to read the FSM files but couldn't open it with their hex editor. For some reason 010 editor doesn't want to read the FSM files (FAK files are fine).

But I tried HxD and it opened it.

For FSM files, some counts in the header, then there are 6 floats (bbox?), followed by a bunch of nulls, followed by probably the vertices, indices, and some material info.

FAK files are probably static meshes while FSM have skeleton. They are similar, but FAK has the indices first, followed by the vertices.

My friends try unpack or read the FSM file, but fail, i think you are fine finale, jajajaja you are true expert, something hope to finished script to unpack or convert the format to redeable in Noesis?.

Like I said - easy format.


FSM - file C01
I don't know what those 6 floats are at the beginning, there are 6 more just before the triangle data, maybe there are position data, i'm guessing males and females have different statures like most games.
Anyway the 11 floats for the vertex data:
X,Y,Z : 4 bytes each
Normals? x3 : 4 bytes each
dunno x3 : 4 bytes each
U,V : 4 bytes each 

The header only contains 2 counts as far as I can see, object count? and vertex count, the rest seem to be file offsets, plus the 6 floats plus empty bytes.
Number of triangles are at the beginning of the triangle list.

the read_ustring method is just for reading ascii strings that store each character in 2 bytes for whatever reason. I won't be including that in the future and will just be putting that in sanae.py

Hardcoded material name.
There are two vertex types; one is your typical 32 bytes, the other is 44 bytes.

I really don't understand why 010 editor can't read fsm and fskin.

The fak files are a little odd. The indices don't look too bad, and then you see a bunch of stuff...but then if you keep going down there's even more strange stuff that doesn't look like anything....

The files were already packed. How did you get the files then?
I'm looking for an unpacker for those cpk files.

well really thanks for your work but I get error n Noesis when try load it, I put Sanae3D too in plugin folder but anyway still my error take a look.

my path where put files is here.

C:\Program Files\Noesis 3.27\plugins\python

take a look this when rename your script to Loong I get this error.



This is with your default name.

If you put a folder called Sanae3D with two files, __init__.py and sanae.py it should work. I use package importing in python.

Anyways here's a version that doesn't depend on that package.
It's probably better if I use the package only for testing cause it only adds overhead to the performance.

[http://xtsukihime.webs.com/Noesis%20Plu ... g_fsm_s.py](http://xtsukihime.webs.com/Noesis%20Plugins/Standalone/fmt_loong_fsm_s.py)

.....

anyways

.fscn files are models for map assets (buildings, etc.)
.fskin files are skinned models.
Formats are all very similar.

I just don't know what .fak is doing.

EDIT: nvm, I used the open dialog in 010 editor directly to open the fsm/fscn files rather than drag and drop, and then it worked. Bug? lol

Seems to be different vertex types, but not sure how.
It's possible that some of the values in the vertex change its size.

The header contains offsets to the vertex/face/material sections, and the vert count is there as well.
But I can't divide things evenly into the vert count.

Some of the files come out to 88 bytes per vertex, which is nice, but then some other files don't divide evenly at all (89.xxx, 92.xxx, etc)

Which files? can find one that differs, format type x18 and x19 is all I got.
The values:- 01000000 04000000 in the 88 bytes are always followed by 4 floats, is there an 01000000 03000000?? or other value followed by that many floats?

NVM - I see it now. 48 bytes + 00000000 + ???????? + 2 floats + long (num_of)
Then there are num_of fields
each field is long + 4 floats

Sounds about right but i'm tierd

Hmm ya, that makes sense. When it's just 1, then we have the 88 byte vertex. When it's 2, we have more. Similarly for 3....etc

I don't know what the vertex type is for then lol
But I think the struct is slightly different for the two, even though they follow the same idea.

Now that that's out of the way...
Those might be the bone references. bone ID + 4 weights maybe?
You see them referenced after the face section...though there may be multiple face sections.

EDIT:

There we go.
Anyone want to upload the skeleton files? They're located in the animation folder (don't have the files on me)

The .fscn files should be pretty simple now that we've identified a couple patterns that the devs used.
The .fak files are still a huge mystery though, and most of the weapons are fak 



[http://xtsukihime.webs.com/Noesis%20Plu ... g_fskin.py](http://xtsukihime.webs.com/Noesis%20Plugins/Standalone/fmt_loong_fskin.py)

Yeah, upload the female parts CriticalError 

4 weights per bone sounds good, looks like some vertex colors as well in all that data.
Anyway, those .fak files, looks like 8 shorts per vertex, dunno what the chunk after the vertices is, damned fixed point data.
Looks like icon data in a few files as well.
Think the 6th long from the start is number of objects, there seems to be that many chunks in the triangle lists.
260 0's instead of 320.
chunk for each objects triangle list seems to go:-
0000 + short(duno-might be 2 bytes) + 6 floats + num_of_tri (long) + triangles + 5 longs(all 0?) + long(with value)

They might be half-floats. I didn't try that. If it's your typical coords/normals/uv that would be great. But I don't have noesis on me right now   

It sucks that 010 editor doesn't display half-floats as one of its inspection values.

If you go to the vertex section (assuming that's what it is), you'll see a bunch of FF's and then followed by an integer.

Then the following section is that integer * 2. Maybe a whole bunch of half-floats?
If you take that integer and divide it by numVerts, you'll always get 11. It might not mean anything of course, but always turning up as 11 is rather curious.

But ya, seriously, what could this be lol

Guess they're not half-floats.
Or at least, nothing nice came out.

It looks like a lot of the file is chunked, where you read an integer and then read that many bytes (or maybe twice that many bytes). This continues until you get to the material section, which is just a typical Loong material.

Header for FAK files

```
int32 ?
int32 vertType
int32 numVerts?
int32 numFaceSections
int32 faceOfs
int32 numMat?
int32 matOfs
int32 unk
int32 vertOfs?

```


And then after that..

```
byte[256] nulls

#a bunch of face groups 
numFaceSections {
   dword ?
   word[2] ?
   float[6] ?
   dword numFaces
   word[numFaces*3] index
   dword[5] null
}

#vert section start
dword ?
float ?
dword count
byte[count] FF's
dword size
byte[size * 2] data?
...

```


Someone post up fscn files.

With half floats the scale will be off, ie really tiny, try scaling up?
11 shorts is 22 bytes, similar to the 44 byte format in the fsm, so it's either half floats or ints(signed).
Ints look similar in scale to the other files.

How come half-floats throw the scale off?

It's not 11 shorts, but literally 11 bytes assuming vertSize = chunkSize / numVerts lol
Anything bigger than that, and you'll be going past that particular section.

Of course there's a whole bunch of similar sections that observe the same pattern, but I don't know...

Anyways when I say "nothing looks good" it's really just a bunch of random points scattered all over the place. Nothing that resembles a weapon of sorts.

http://www.4shared.com/rar/TdP7YgfC/fscn.html

Ya the format was pretty much the same as fsm.
Except there is some odd struct at the very end of the file...

Some textures would be nice also.
Get the textures that are named like M01_01, M01_02, etc so I can post a screenshot that looks colorful.

The game's music is pretty nice: [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHn4xB_j4jo](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHn4xB_j4jo)

Half floats don't, having your scale set to 100 does that, silly me.
No, it's 11 shorts, chunk size given is half the actual chunk size.

Using ints, I put that second set of data in, it's 6 bytes per vertex, I got very similar results, the corners of a cube distribution of points.
I noticed though that filename_a is an FSM and without the _a it's fak....
Some models like j06 use the same texture for a few of models.
Going to go through the files see if there is anything that suggests it's not actually a model format, or if it reuses verts from another file.

Oh. Ya, 11 shorts.

The bows are the g items.
the first couple g's are FSM, but then the rest are FAK's.

I guess it's possible they might design something like that...

I like how multiple models that use the same texture simple duplicate the texture in each folder.

Lol - i just tried it with half floats, came out very nice.
Guess you been doing the rapi.rpgBindPositionBufferOfs(vertBuff, noesis.RPGEODATA_FLOAT, 32, 0) type thing with 11 instead of 22.....
That'll make it read crap if you use 11.

So basically it's the same vertex format as the fsm files that uses 44 bytes per vertex, but using 16bit floats instead of 32bit floats.
Not sure if vertex data has multiple chunks if there is more than 1 'object' like in the triangle lists.

That's it!
lol ya I was reading numVerts*11 as well   

Some sexy bow...like things in those FAK files.



Well, there goes that mystery.
It never occurred to me that 11 bytes doesn't make too much sense lol

The integer before the vertOfs might be the number of vertex groups, but it's not obvious which faces reference which vertices.

Each face group has a short that indicates how many vertices are referenced.
They even throw in some ascii-encoded strings in there lol

Maybe it'll become clear once the entire file is parsed and all of the unknowns re-evaluated.

The face groups are definitely referencing different vertex groups. Some of them just happen to load up fine.

It seems like I'm assigning the faces in the wrong direction though...

EDIT:

here's something that I noticed, if you didn't notice this already.
As already known, in each face group, it starts with an integer, followed by 2 shorts. Then 6 floats, the numFaces, followed by the indices.

The first integer is useful because it gives us the vertex offset.

So the first face group references the first n vertices starting at vertex 0.
The second face group references the next m vertices starting at vertex n.
The third face group references the next i vertices starting at vertex n + m
etc

In simpler terms, supposing I have two face groups, a vert list = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8] and my first face group referenced the first 5 vertices [0, 1, 2, 3, 4], then the next face group would reference the remaining 4 vertices [5, 6, 7, 8], where the indices are relative to the subset of vertices.

With that said, here's G11.fak



Sadly, I'm still skipping a whole bunch of data. I'm basically reading the vertex data, and then seeking straight to the material section.

Awesomeness.
Didn't notice that about the integer being vertex offsets.
The face direction looks intermittent, even on some fsm models the faces are wrong way around.
I'll have a look see if it's model type.

Now...skel files.

It is not obvious which skel file is associated with which model. Kind of weird.

At a glance, it looks like you have the skeleton names, followed by a list of integers which I guess might have something to do with indexing and parenting and stuff. Then you get a whole bunch of floats, which I would suppose are the bone transforms among other things.

There's way too much info in the Fskel files to be just skeleton data.
Also the 'skeleton' is identical in all 5 Fskel files I have.
Looking at it with the data visualizer in hex workshop, you can clearly see large chunks which are about 3k each, reckon this is the animation files for the characters. 
Chunks are Poses?

Considering that it's in a folder called "animation" that would be a reasonable guess.
But there aren't any other files then.

Maybe the skeleton is at the top, followed by animation?

Yeah, I think they are animation frames, but I don't really know how they work.

5th byte in the header gives the number of frames.
Header also gives the offset for the start of the frames.
Each frame seems to consists of:

```
7F00 - num_bones
00 - dunno
byte + 7 floats (num_bones of these)
00 - byte
8988083D - dunno
00000000 - dunno

```


Edit - seen this before, each file might represent a set of animations for a particular action, like attack, defend, jumping, casting spells....

Oh uh actually when we were looking at those fskin files we found that there was a section of stuff right after the indices, which corresponded bone indices that were referenced in the vertex section.

So....that might be it lol

The format for each struct is

```
float[16] matrix

```


But if you were to ask me how to connect those, I would have no clue.
Parenting might be implicit based on how they are stored? Though I've looked at a lot of formats, I never really went to look at skeleton data, so I'm not sure of the various ways to store the data that would optimize stuff.

Sorta found a hierarchy for the skeleton, it's in the numbers after the names, no idea how it works mind.
Was a bit confusing coz the number of bones x 16 was the chunk size for that data.
Don't know what the extra 0's are at the end.
Makes some sense, the second column goes 0 to num_bones and the end value is the parent bone?
Needs a diagram.
BTW, did some cutting and pasting in the text prog, so it might not be as accurate as it should be.

Anyway:

Might be a different vertex format that I didn't catch.

It may even be the same game just published under a different name.

It's a rat type thing on a chest.
You got the texture for that? TW_d.TGA (or .dds)

16 bytes per vertex instead of 22.
Had to hash out 4 lines of materials code for it to work.

```
        
        for vertCount in vertGroups:
            vertBuff = self.inFile.readBytes(vertCount*16)
            self.vertBuffs.append(vertBuff)

```


```
            rapi.rpgBindNormalBufferOfs(vertBuff, noesis.RPGEODATA_HALFFLOAT, 16, 6)
            rapi.rpgBindUV1BufferOfs(vertBuff, noesis.RPGEODATA_HALFFLOAT, 16, 12)

```

Ok I've fixed my script.

The vertType appears to be that float when you start the vertex section (0.125 vs 0.033333....).
I rounded it off to 3 places in the script cause I don't like floating point comparison.

The matNum I wrote down before is correct.
It's just that some of them might be -1 and I didn't check that lol

I still haven't figured out how to determine whether the faces should be drawn backwards or not...

Thanks, btw errors on D06.fak (in the original samples)

A lot of the models need both sides of a face drawn.
Maybe they just don't bother? they are fairly low poly.

Hmm, maybe it's not actually a float? Maybe I should treat them as 4 separate byte flags?

0.03333333507180214
0.03354166820645332

Anyways I decided to stick with floats and rounding...

Hmmm, 4 byte flags sound good.
if vertType == b'\x3E':
or '\x3D'

if the 3rd bytes 1st bit is 1 then culling is on?
(don't work for the blood soul file though)

I went back to this game to look at the skeleton but decided to fix some of the plugins.
It looks like I didn't actually finish the .fsm plugin and so I went and fixed that up.

Then it occurred to me that I didn't know whether the .fskel files are actually the skeleton or animations, and nothing really makes it obvious which .fskel file I should be opening.

Hello! someone can provide .fskel support for the .fskin script of finale00 please?!, due many meshes are in weird position, like running or attacking position and is hard to re position it in T-pose.  Thanks in advance!
