Nobody can tell you what formats these files are merely base on the filenames if you neither upload any samples nor telling where the files are from.

Sounds like XNALara/XPS files to me. Especially if you downloaded them from deviantart or something.

Yeah, sounds like XNALara.

I use this plugin for Blender to open the files, seems to work really well: [https://johnzero7.deviantart.com/journa ... -629778749](https://johnzero7.deviantart.com/journal/Blender-2-74-XPS-tools-1-7-0-629778749)
