I have to ask, why do you want to download v.4.2? The current version is 4.3, and there's a download link [here](http://multiex.xentax.com/) (scroll to the bottom of the page).

Pardon my ignorance, but what code are you talking about? Is it something you've posted about somewhere else on the forum, or is it a BMS script you've written?

The older ones are no longer up on the pages.
Youl have to PM Mr Mouse about it.
Though i think something changed in the system for th most recent one so you might have to ask mr mouse for a new code in replace for ur own.
