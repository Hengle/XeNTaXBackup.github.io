- Post Title: SC1 Activating Subtitles

In the game: Splinter Cell 1 at the beggining there is cut-scene video where Lamber and Fisher are talkin at the firts time.

So these text were given in the subtitle file (In the russian version, .rus, .int)

Can I somehow enable subtitles for that cut-scenes?
Game on Unreal Engine 2
