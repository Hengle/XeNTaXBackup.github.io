- Post Title: WWF Smackdown 2:Know Your Role ED1 Files (ED1H-L-B)

Since its been discovered how to extract textures from the latest smackdown games I've been trying to figure out how to extract models from the game. I do believe that the ED1 files hold model (textures). My goal is to have them extracted and be able to re-import them back into the game. There are three ED1 files. ED1H (head model textures) ED1B (Body) ED1L (legs)
If someone could look into exytracting textures from these files, I could do more in modding the game.

I just found an old post of mine and realized that there was no link posted. Here are the files.

Is it possible that someone could make a tool to extract texture files from the pacs in the download?
