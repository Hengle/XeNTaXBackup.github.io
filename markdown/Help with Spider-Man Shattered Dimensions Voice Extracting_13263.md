- Post Title: Help with Spider-Man Shattered Dimensions Voice Extracting

Hello, I'm new at this forum and I would like to ask how to extract voice files from the PC game Spider-Man Shattered Dimensions. The format for these files are .dat.
I Googled around, tried some tools but none of them worked. I would be grateful if anyone helped to extract these voices. If I need to upload them, they are around 1gb big each.
If this in the wrong section, I'm sorry.
Thanks!
