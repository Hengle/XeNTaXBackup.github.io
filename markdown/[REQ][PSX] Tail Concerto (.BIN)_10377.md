- Post Title: [REQ][PSX] Tail Concerto (.BIN)

Hi, guys 

Can someone look at DATA.BIN archive in this game - Tail Concerto on psx?
I will be very grateful if you could try to create some tool or quick bms script to unpack/repack this file.

In this game there are also files like XA.BIN (music) and STRA.BIN (cut-scenes), but they are too big to upload on my website 

But if it is necessary, just send me PM and i'll try to upload them somewhere else
