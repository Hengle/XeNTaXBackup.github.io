- Post Title: Hot Wheels Crash (lwo)

I found a game called hot wheels crash, which has a file that is unusal, it has the file called LWO, the textures are bmp which paint net can support. I have plans to convert those assets to midtown madness 2 or something like MMD

Get assets here

the header starts with FORM which is consistent with this being a standard LWO (Light Wave Object)

try the LWO importer plugin for blender
