- Post Title: Re-Installed Multi-EX 4.3.0...Cant register??

I purchased my Reg code to Unlock everything for $10 about a month ago.

last night I was making a track and went to use M-ex when I got an MRF file failure upon startup. after a few failed attempts, I thought I d just re-install it, since I have my code. 

It installs fine, but when I go to register it, it says Registered version in the window, and won't let me type anything. however the Buttons for Editing and extracting files are X-ed out still in the program window

Is there something I need to Delete before I re-install Multi-ex? maybe a registry setting that will give me a clean Install? I tried to delete the leftover files from uninstalling it, but no-go.
I have attached my About window and Debug log for you in a rar file.


thanks for your help. john

Well, the X-es are normal, because only when you actually open an archive will these be removed. Or did you have an archive open?

The shortest way to get it to work would be to uninstall it, making sure the original directory is deleted with all content (especially the config dir). 

Then re-install it. It is normal for the program to detect it was already registered. But I think you had not completely removed it yet? Lemme know.

No problem, as a matter of fact, looking at the log I noticed another problem with the online MexCom resources at the Xentax WIKI (Game File Format Central) and fixed that. So your post came in handy

Yes. There's more info on this forum on that matter.
