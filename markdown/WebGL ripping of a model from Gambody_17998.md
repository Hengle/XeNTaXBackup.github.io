- Post Title: WebGL ripping of a model from Gambody

Hello friends

after a long battle to get models ripping on other sites. I came across Gambody, there are incredible models there and it would be interesting to work on it. I tried to use some traditional methods, already knowing that it would go wrong but even then I tried and I could not.

I got this part directly from HXD I do not understand, I generated this file through ctrl + s hahahhha

Anyway I believe someone will find out something about it.
