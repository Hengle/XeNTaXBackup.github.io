Hey everyone, I am sorry for not putting up any releases. I was caught up in improving the texture support. Check back 1/23/2019, when version 1.1 will be live.

Steep's compression has been figured out. I present you the first texture from Steep!



edit: Until Version 1.1 goes public, you must manually hunt for the extracted textures. They are found in the Temporary Path set in the Settings. Version 1.0's release is now on the Releases page.

Thanks for reporting the error. However, I cannot see the entire error. Could you copy & paste it onto Pastebin, for further inspection?

Textures can be extracted with Versions 1.0-1.1. Version 1.1 releases today with full texture support for Odyssey and Origins.

Version 1.1 will not support 3D models. 3D models are very complex and I am still performing tests on them. No ETA on those yet.

Attempt to research the format of Origins models

[](https://ibb.co/Bgt96G1)

[](https://ibb.co/CJ4kYRF)

[](https://ibb.co/RCtXCtX)

Very-very raw script for "-combined" decompressed mesh files  (there is a strange  vertex format with inversions)
May be help for further development of the tool.

Also there is a request (proposal)
- make functions for export the entire file structure as xml (to find the necessary resources)
The project has a function "Create FileLisr", but it seems it does not create anything.

This is great, I really appreciate the work you're putting into this. Not to make assumptions, but I can't be the only lurker who's been hoping someone would come around and open up these games. I realize that a code illiterate peon like myself couldn't be much more than a cheerleader, but if there's anything I can do help out, just let me know.

Hello everyone. I wanted to provide an update:
- I am currently investigating materials and texture sets
- Version 1.2 is in the works, due sometime next week

Who knows? The fruits of my research may eventually lead to auto-texturing. Though, no promises.

Thanks for the update, I'll definitely be keeping an eye on this thread. Auto-texturing sounds intriguing, but I imagine that's probably fairly complicated, right?

At any rate, very exciting, much appreciation for your efforts!

I would first need to figure out how materials, texture sets, and texture maps are interrelated. Yes, auto-texturing would be complicated. I mentioned it as a possibility. I hope that shaders are not involved, as they might be compiled.

Are you sure that the unpacker displays all the resources?
I can not find the diffuse of both Odyssey playable characters (Kassandra Alexios).
Those that I found are more like to combine spec gloss , etc.

update - ALL heads diffuse map is very strange. Do you can look it?
Or may be Odyssey use specific shader for skin, without "classic" diffuse...

They are like that, there's no diffuse maps in common meaning (for human skin, or I think for any material with subsurface scattering). That's why this game sucks xD (IMHO)

Armors and weapons/shields are fine, diffuse maps I mean. Only skin, bare skin parts are bad - sadly 
Btw, I don't know how exactly this tool extracting files, so anyone who want to try alternative method, you could use this bms script to extract all files from .forge. They will be grouped by type of resources, works for both origins - odyssey. After extraction you could use another bms script from aluigi [http://aluigi.altervista.org/bms/assassin_creed_raw.bms](http://aluigi.altervista.org/bms/assassin_creed_raw.bms)

As of now, no. Localization is a possibility in the future. However, I have not looked into localization files (subtitles, UI elements, etc.). I'm guessing they might be compressed/encrypted.

Here is ACD_CHM_PLA_AlexiosHead_DiffuseMap, using DX10 and BC7_UNORM.



It is evident that the skin color is not present. This leads me to think that the skin color is applied in a shader as @erik945 said.

In response to what I said above, the shader probably uses one (or more) color channels from a texture that looks like the one above. It applies a color to that and the result is the skin texture we see in-game.
Only speculating.

I don't know if it's any help but here's a video by the person who was responsible for creating the shaders for the characters; given his response in the comment section, the different channels are used as masks.

More or less working prototype of the script for Origins(without bones and slin). It was checked on models of weapons and animals.
It does not work for models of heads - there is generally a very different structure.

Hello all, here is an update. Version 1.2 will release tomorrow (2/2/2019).

It will contain support for Steep textures, FULL SOUND SUPPORT (.pck files; with extraction), a find tool, texture conversion for the three games, and several other changes.

I am also working on localization. Support for localization is TBD. Of course, I will notify you all of its readiness.

Version 1.3 is in the works, with FULL texture support (UI/HUD textures) from the three games and an improved Image Viewer.

I am also working on localization data (subtitles, UI). Let's see if I can get this in Version 1.3...

By the way, are there any errors/crashes in Blacksmith that I should be aware of?

I haven't run into any catastrophic errors yet.

- I've noticed an error being thrown after extracting an entire forge archive.
- Many Odyssey textures aren't displaying or exporting properly, though it sounds like you're on top of that.

Update regarding Version 1.3
Here is a list of changes to expect:

- the 3D Viewer will be ready
- PRIMITIVE Origins 3D model support 
--- I emphasize "Primitive" because only geometry will be supported; not every model will work
- full texture support for the three games (including UI/HUD)
- improvements to the Image Viewer
- a Find feature that works
- no localization support (despite what I said in my previous post)

Expected to release sometime 2/15/2019-2/17/2019

Title say AC Odyssey,but it support AC Origins?

I ask that because I run into few errors

I can't see MESH models and textures are not above 64x64 inside Blacksmith,

and the message I get when I want to decompress file after exporting
[https://drive.google.com/open?id=1g67sp ... mhhgt4LWpA](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1g67sp-X_bI3NACwqqAUMbmhhgt4LWpA)_

It's very much in development right now, as I understand it. With the current released version of Blacksmith (1.2), I've been able to export most textures from origins, as well as decompressed mesh files which can be imported with the maxscript from the first page- though some meshes have errors and artifacts. I haven't had much luck with either meshes or textures from Odyssey yet, so you're not alone there, its WIP functionality. I don't have Steep so I'm not really sure what's working yet on that game. I'd say just do what the rest of us are doing and keep your eyes glued to the thread.

Thanks for reporting the error. The error comes from the "Tools > Decompress File" feature. It will be fixed in Version 1.3.

The reason why I named the thread "Blacksmith - an Assassin's Creed: Odyssey extraction tool" is because of:
1. a character limit
2. original intention was to support only AC: Odyssey, but I discovered that AC: Origins was very similar
3. AC: Odyssey is the newest game in the AC series, and the title would cause curiosity
4. once a user clicks on the link (with the user assuming the tool only support Odyssey) and discovers that Origins and Steep are also supported, the user would be delighted or overwhelmed

Version 1.3 will still release this weekend, probably Monday (2/18/2019) at the latest.

Update - Version 1.3 released
This 3D model stuff is quite a headache. Expect it later. In the meantime, here is Version 1.3 with everything I mentioned above WITHOUT Origins 3D geometry support and the Find feature.

Here is some of what is new:
- working 3D Viewer (with the Utah teapot loaded by default)
> you can play around with it to get a hang of the wacky controls
- better Image Viewer
- MUCH FASTER LOADING and EXTRACTION
- full texture support from all games
- all entries from a .forge are displayed
- zoom works with all images

I signed up just to say thanks for developing this.  Every time I've searched for any kind of extractor for Assassin's Creed Odyssey I have been disappointed until I found your thread.

One person used a photos-to-3D-model software to make a bust of Kassandra, and another apparently managed to extract Kassandra in certain clothing but neither enabled me to do what I wanted.

I am looking forward to being able to extract meshes for 3D printing!  I create action figures (as limited as that is with an FDM machine)--and I hoped to test a new personal technique on ACO characters.

Nice, everything loads way faster now. Having some issues, though. I ran into two errors right away when browsing through DataPC_ACD_Greece.forge. When trying to preview ACD_GEN_ALL_MarbleRed_01_DiffuseMap, blacksmith crashes without an error. So far this has happened on every Odyssey texture I've attempted. Also, in the same forge file, attempting to decompress any mesh causes an exception. You can see the text [here](https://justpaste.it/71ue0). Both of these errors are also occuring with Origins files as well. All of the meshes I tried to decompress were ones that weren't visible in the list in version 1.2. It almost seems like the script can't figure out what to extract. As for texture extraction, I haven't been able to test it, as every time I click on a texture map, blacksmith crashes.

Many thanks, and as always, if there's anything I can help with, just ask.

Update - Version 1.3.1
User @cire992 discovered an issue that I overlooked. If a texture has TopMips or Mips, the texture will fail to load.

Version 1.3.1 has been released, with this fix and other fixes.

Excellent, just tested with a bunch of textures from Origins and Odyssey. Everything previewed and extracted successfully. Glad to hear it was just a minor issue. I haven't been able to reproduce the exception with the mesh decompression in either Origins or Odyssey. In both cases, meshes seem to be decompressing normally, so I think its safe to say that both bugs I mentioned in my last post are well and truly squashed. Stellar work as always, man. I'll let you know if I run into anything. In all honesty, though, I'm having a blast just rummaging through the art in these games. As a fan of both 3d art and ancient history, these games have a special appeal to me. so, at the risk of sounding like a broken record, thanks again for all your efforts on this program.

cire992 what have you managed to extract? I am new to both the Assassin's Creed series and poking around this file format. I am looking for Kassandra and Alexios to make action figures on my 3D printer and have no idea where to start digging.

Thanks!

Start rummaging through each .forge file, then you will find 3D models and textures. 3D model support is nowhere near completed. Texture support is complete.

Once a search feature is implemented (ideally wildcard supporting) finding files should be easier--like *Kassandra* or *ship*.

Is it possible to code something that would pseudo collapse the lengthy file prefixes like GEN_STUFF_HERE_ActualTextOfInterest? So Gen, Stuff, and Here would be treated as virtual folders.

Correct! There will be a functional Find/Search feature in the next version. Wildcards and RegEx are possibilities.

Yes, that is normal behavior. Look in the .forge file itself (with a hex editor) and you will find hashed names like this.

Amazing Work

I peak in to Origins Textures
Diffuse and Normal Maps are readable only,some dds are not,even some other tools can't read it.
I can't export Alpha Textures properly even with dds programs,hope you will also see what's up with that.
(they are without alpha mask that's all)

I can't remember last time someone dedicated time to make a good program for exploring game archives like this.
Keep rocking.

#legendary

Edit:
Looks like Alpha is with Normals,so it's not Blacksmith mistake

I would focus on exporting geometry over correct texture previewing, but that's my opinion and the decision's up to you.

Can you show me the fregment shader of your model?
You can check vertex color and normal vector first.
I think you can use simplest shader to just display diffuse and normal map, because AC's shading is very complex(it is a PBR material, skin or hair shading is more complex).

You need more time to render model as it looks as game.

Many DiffuseMap can't display correctly, when I click it, it will pop a dialog:
"Texture failed to convert to PNG. Alternatively, you can right-click the TEXture_MAP node, select "Texture > Save as DDS ''


When I Save it as dds, there are many noise point in it.
You can try "DataPC_ACE_Egypt.forge" >> "CE_U_Juno_Anubis_Hand_DiffuseMap".

Environment Mesh(such as Olive Tree) seems can't be extracted correctly.
I used the maxscript in page 1, It works well on Character model, but when I import environment mesh in 3ds max, it just show me disorderly triangles.
You can try this mesh of AC: Origins:

Announcement:

Version 1.4 is in development, and will release on or before March 10, 2019. Some changes to look for:
- Find feature with Regex and wildcard support
- ** Partial Origins 3D model support (exporting too!)
- texture extraction and exporting fixes
- better 3D Viewer
- support for more Resource Types
- bug fixes and UI improvements

** Note: Partial does not mean full support. Blacksmith will not be able to load every model. I intend to support at least vegetation, clothes, animals, weapons, and statues.

This is fantastic work, thank you!  I've been using it to extract textures and compare them to the ones intercepted by Resorep. I've noticed a few things that might be helpful for you.  For the TEXTURE_MAP type, the TopMip structure in ExtractTextureMap should have Height first like the DDS format.  They're also not strictly dimensions.  Many of them are scaled up by a factor of 2 or 4, and often just correcting the width and height in the output DDS is enough to fix them.  I thought the scale factor would be determined by the DXTType, but I haven't found any definite patterns.  Also, the _TopMip_* entries at least have an extra 8 bytes at the end that aren't image data.

Hey, thanks for the info. I will update the TEXTURE_MAP code for Version 1.4. The last 8 bytes that you mention is probably a file ID (int64).

I had a revelation regarding Origins 3D models. That it why the update will be here before the estimated date.

3D model support for Origins has yet to be implemented, until Version 1.4.

Version 1.4 (The long-awaited update)
Partial Origins 3D model support (viewing and exporting as OBJ) (DAE is in the works)
- geometry
- normals
- basic UVs
NOTE part 1: As I previous mentioned, the 3D model importer does not support every model. I tried samples from each category (vegetation, clothes, animals, weapons, and statues) and all worked. Your success will vary.
NOTE part 2: Blacksmith will not crash if interpretation of the 3D model goes awry. Instead, an error message will appear.
NOTE part 3: The 3D model importer is slow. Please be patient.
NOTE part 4: Not all meshes will render, due to parsing issues.
NOTE part 5: Lastly, there might be excess faces. Use Blender, 3ds Max, or a similar software to remove these.



Find feature
- you asked, here it is
- RegEx
- wildcards
- all results are displayed in the Find window
- right-click > `Show in List` (will jump to that entry in Blacksmith)
- it searches the first expanded .forge from any game
- in the future, you will be able to specify which .forge to search in

3D Viewer improvements
- better controls
- colorful models, for clarity (I use a shader that renders each vertex's normal)
- statistics and Reset Camera button on the bottom

UI improvements & bug fixes
- go here [https://github.com/theawesomecoder61/Bl ... ANGELOG.md](https://github.com/theawesomecoder61/Blacksmith/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) to see a full list of changes
- I left in a few grayed-out features for a reason.

Ready? https://github.com/theawesomecoder61/Bl ... h/releases

Version 1.5 is on the horizon. Mid-late March 2019.

Heroic work, man! It's working good so far, no major bugs outside of what you described above. I'll keep you informed of any weirdness if I notice anything. I haven't been having any problems with vegetation, characters, weapons etc. But the environment props (buildings, props, rocks etc) have bugs from time to time. Inconsistently, though, some don't have any problems. DataPC_ACE_Egypt/EGY_MON_Temple_Rampart_6m_01A_LOD0 is a good example of a glitchy mesh with the current importer. The Temple_Rampart set is all over the place, actually. Some meshes work fine, others have glitches, some load but throw errors and a couple don't load at all. Mysterious. Other than that, though, this is the best update yet, by far. I'm having a blast digging around through these files, it's astounding how much stuff was in this game.

Thanks again for all your hard work!

In Origins, No luck over here Sir, I can't see no mesh but also textures?
in 1.3.1 I am fine with textures, now I lost both with 1.4 .
Anyone else have this issue?

I can't seem to download the source for 1.4.  The latest commit 53fb55f is a 1.3 version and when it launches it still shows the gray teapot.  The binary package on the other hand shows the teapot normals and reports 1.4 in the About box.  Was this a binary-only release?  Thanks

There is a bug on exporting model as obj format.
When I use 3ds max to import exported obj file, some obj can't be imported.
3Ds max will  pop up a error dialog: "Invalid vertex index".
You can check this bug with this asset:
DATAPC_ACE_Egypt.forge >>  BIO_VEG_DatePalm_Tall_01A_LOD0 >> MESH

It will export 5 obj files. 2 of them can't be imported correctly.

It's really good work so far, 
I hope you will focus on OBJ format in next update
I open some of models in 3ds max (no UW mapping currently and objects have few mesh issues)
Can't wait for next update.

Just found this thread and i'm
so excited to when you get to DAE extraction and Steep support

Perhaps ASCII or SMD support in future?

SMD? Yes.
Fix OBJ? Yep.
Fix DAE? Surely.
Improved model importer? Yes.
Version 1.5 (Mid-late March 2019)

I think DAE is greater than OBJ, because obj can't support multi-UV and other vertex property.
As I know, Human skin mesh(Face, Body) contain 2 uv coordinates.

Can you support view and export textures named "*_TopMip_0", I think these are mipmaps of texture.
And I find most of GFX textures only have MIPMAP(don't have TEXTUREMAP)

Hello everyone. My break is over. Time to get back to work on Blacksmith version 1.5.

I have been poking at certain AC: Origins models (namely DataPC_ACE_Egypt.forge > BIO_VEG_DatePalm_Tall_01A_LOD0 or DataPC_PresentDay.forge > PRE_ALL_Jeep_01_LOD0). The Faces chunk has more faces than the total of each mesh/submesh's faces. For example, there are 12608 found in the Faces chunk of BIO_VEG_DatePalm_Tall_01A_LOD0, but only 12364 totaled by the meshes.

This problem might explain the random excess faces. My hunch is that there is padding between each mesh's group of faces (in other words: after the first mesh's faces, there is padding, and this repeats).

Quest for the community
Could any of you investigate this? I attached BIO_VEG_DatePalm_Tall_01A_LOD0. Use 7-Zip or WinRAR to open the file. I appreciate your help.

Useful information: The Vertices chunk begins at 0x133 (307) and the Faces chunk begins at 0x567BF (354239). The end of the Faces chunk is at 0x68F42 (429890).

You are totally ignoring the submesh table, which is "int[][] cluelessData" in your code. It contains info on starting index and starting vertex for each submesh. That is the padding you need.

Alright, everyone. I know that you all have been waiting patiently for an update regarding Version 1.5. I assure you that it will be available by March 27, 2019 and you will be delighted.

In the meantime, I have been investigating Origins models further and improving the importer in Blacksmith. I want to share with you a discovery.

I found three unknown chunks after the Faces chunk, of which I have yet to figure what each of these chunks are. These three chunks appear before the MeshData chunk (which begins with 0x645ABB5). This is the part of my 010 Editor template for these three chunks:

```
    byte data[48];
} Unknown2Type;

struct Unknown2 {
    int size;
    Unknown2Type unknown2Types[size/48];
} unknown2;

typedef struct {
    byte data[48];
} Unknown3Type;

struct Unknown3 {
    int size;
    Unknown3Type unknown3Types[size/48];
} unknown3;

typedef struct {
    byte data[28];
} Unknown4Type;

struct Unknown4 {
    int size;
    Unknown4Type unknown4Types[size/28];
} unknown4;
```


The count of Unknown2Types and Unknown3Types is referenced in the Compiled Mesh chunk (0xFC9E1595) 34 bytes after 0xFC9E1595, at the top of the file.

From the file in my previous post (BIO_VEG_DatePalm_Tall_01A_LOD0), I extracted these three chunks for you to test the code above yourself with 010 Editor. This is attached.

Moral of the story: If any of you could help me determine what each chunk is, that would be much appreciated.

No, I have not identified those chunks. They will remain unknown. For our purposes now (extracting only the geometry, normals, and texture coordinates), these chunks are probably not important.

Version 1.5 may or may not be delayed by a day or two, because of an ugly issue with the model importer.
Fear not, though! Tomorrow I will provide a Noesis script for Origins to tie you over until Version 1.5's release.

This is great! No errors so far, and I've been testing out lots of different kinds of meshes. Even the problematic architectural meshes are working fine. You're doing an awesome job with this, I really appreciate it.   

As always, I'll let you know if I notice anything interesting while I mess around with the script.

I could look into incorporating For Honor. I have before, but the structures are quite different than the latest AC games and Steep. Those games are the focus of Blacksmith.

Version 1.5 (preview)
I hope this was worth the wait! This is not official Version 1.5, but a preview (so that you all may try out the new features and also a vital feature no longer works).

Better Origins 3D model support
- Proper geometry and normals
- UVs (not UV sets)

Initial Odyssey 3D model support
- You read that right
- Same features as Origins 3D model support

Exporting/Saving
- a nice window with some configurations
- 3D models: OBJ only for now
- Textures: fail (read below)

Find dialog
- "Forge to search in" - choose which open/expanded .forge file to search in
- Double-click an entry to reveal it in Blacksmith

Others
- 3D Viewer and UI improvements (including Show in Explorer)

NOTE ABOUT TEXTURE CONVERSION
texconv, the backend that Blacksmith uses to convert textures went brain-dead. It fails to convert textures now. Once I resolve this, expect the full Version 1.5 release. However, this does not stop you from extracting textures. I implemented a temporary solution. Or you can right-click and select Show in Explorer.

So, why am I releasing this version with a broken texture viewing function? The reason is because I did not want to keep you all antsy for any longer. Thank you for understanding.

Thank you Sir

I tested it, OBJ is good no UV slots like you said, but that's the only thing missing for complete model, can't imagine how hard was it so far for you.

I remember in last version I exported this tall Egypt Forge palm to obj but now it's gives me an error
[https://i.imgur.com/9UExuCu.png](https://i.imgur.com/9UExuCu.png)
So please guys try this to export this model from image(tried with some other options (it gave me trunk only=half of palm)

rest of models were exported successfully, textures to are ok.

Can't wait to for full package to start window shopping Origins Forge archives

Excellent job man!  I'm always impressed on how some people is able to work so hard to help others

Do you think it would be possible to have the option to hide the waning messages? I spent more time closing them than actually exporting something 

Keep going man!!! we are waiting forward to make some sweet sweet mods 

P.S. you should give us some way to donate or help you man!!

Here's something I discovered from a "not-reading-instructions-closely-enough" perspective.

1.  Open Blacksmith Find tool.
2.  "Forge to search in" is blank and the dropdown is empty.
3.  Wonder why.
4.  Type query, press search.
5.  Receive null exception.

Upon closer reading, I realized I needed to expand a Forge under one of the games first.  Once you do that, this error won't occur again until you relaunch Blacksmith after which it starts with no Forge selected.

Thee exact error is: 

```
Parameter name: source at
System.Linq.Enumerable.Where[TSource](IEnumerable`1 source, Func`2 predicate)
at Blacksmith.Form1.<>c__DisplayClass44_0.<OnFindAll>b__5() in
C:\Users\pinea\source\repos\Blacksmith\Blacksmith\Form1.cs:line 775
```


I'm currently eating breakfast and don't have Visual Studio installed (I'm just reading in Notepad++).  From this quick glance, to reduce this incidence of [PEBCAK](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=PEBCAK) I'd suggest some way to catch situations where x.GetForge() and thus args.ForgeToSearchIn come back null on line 762 in Form1.cs.

Then notify the user they done goofed, like "Please expand a Forge file under the left-hand navigation tree before searching!"

Thanks for clarifying this. That feature is intended to work like that, where you must select which Forge to search in, as the name suggests. When I release the next version, the error (that you provided) will be countered with a warning.

Edit (4/1/2019): Version 1.5.1 is released. Enjoy the texture conversion and fixes!

Fantastic! I've tested a few origins models, exporting is working fine- including uvs. Testing Odyssey for the first time, the models are exporting fine. For Odyssey, the only model type I've had trouble with yet are character meshes (DataPC_SharedGroup_00/ACD_CHB_SPA_H12_Helmet_LOD0). The error message is usually: 'Failed to read model. Unable to read beyond the end of the stream'. I haven't found anything besides character models that throw this error. I've tested various environments, weapons, trees, and boats, all working just like with Origins. 

Can't believe you've already moved into Odyssey, though. Seriously impressive stuff, man. Can't thank you enough.  

edit: Oh, jaysus, he uploaded another version while I was typing. I'm gonna test out 1.5.1, I'll amend this post as needed.

1.5.1 edit:

Textures are working! I'm trying textures from both games. I noticed a weird glitch last week regarding textures. It only happens on some images, and I can't find any pattern with it. I've attached an image of what it looks like. Here's a path to one: DataPC_ACD_Greece/ACD_SHD_Wood_03_DiffuseMap.

The issue with the Odyssey character models is still applicable to 1.5.1. The error message has some extra jargon, but seems to be the same problem I described above.

Other than that, two giant thumbs up from me.

Very nice Tool! Finally i got a chance to try Blacksmith and it works well. But i got an Import Error in Blender, and then in 3DS Max too.

1. i extracted from Origins DataPC_ACE_Egypt the following two files:
   -CE_A_Hyena_Body_LOD0
   -CE_A_Hyena_Hair_LOD0

Hello,
I think this is a great tool and thank you so much your incredible efforts but I got a failure message when I tried to pick some meshes. Not every mesh especially under the DataPC_SharedGroup_00.forge.   
[](https://ibb.co/8N7zfm7)

Also I have to same error in the top message when I tried to mesh import into blender. I imported mesh into 3dcoat successfully.

Tried in 4 programs to open your new OBJ format, failed.
Something funny tho, Zmodeler2 can open it but can't export.

That and few textures format program can't read right
Just as guys above Reported.

Edit:
tested on animals
Noesis acor script can load anything but, without UV data.

If you could focus on UV for now, since acor python can read mesh data

Thanks everyone for your explanatory feedback. The issues you all face seem to surround how Blacksmith handles models with skeletons. I assure you all that I am poking at models with skeletons (animals, armor, heads, etc.), and these errors will be resolved in the next update.

If any of you read the changelog on the GitHub repo, you will notice that I write "Initial Odyssey 3D model support". This is true of Origins as well. When I write this, it means that I have laid the foundation of the 3D model importer, but the importer is far from perfection (working with every model). I want you to be aware that I know that the importers will not fully work upon their debuts in Blacksmith.

The next major update could release mid-April 2019?

of course, we thank you for all your work. I just wanted to report the issue, looking forward to the next version and still looking every day to this thread

Seems like 3D model export was ok in 1.5 preview,
but in 1.5.1 the models have issues with vertex maps
(completely messed UV's, which is crucial, and absent normals, which is not a problem cause baked normals must be dealt with anyway)

This tool is fantastic so far.
Static meshes are great, but skinned model export would be even greater.

First of all thank you for your exceptional work. 
But I can't use it: where am I wrong? I didn't install Assassin's Creed Origin but I have the .forge file available. So, I open Blacksmith 1.5.1 then I select the Assassin's Creed Origin file folder. I save a mesh in .obj but nothing happens. Also I don't see the preview of model in Blacksmith. Maybe it's because I didn't install the game?
Please can you help me?

Thanks

Hi, I'm trying to get a 3d model from Assassin's Creed Odyssey (more precisely the Immortal hood to print it with my 3d printer). I found the file but every time I try to open it I get this message : [](https://www.noelshack.com/2019-14-7-1554672326-dddddd.png)

What should I do to get the mesh ?

Thanks a lot for this tool, was waiting for it!

The issue I'm having is about normal maps in Origins. I've seen that it's not the tool's fault, but I was wondering how others are actually extracting them or having them to show up correctly in photoshop.

Version 1.6
Here is a taste of the changes in 1.6. Go to the GitHub repo to see the entire changelog.
500+ recognized data types
- Blacksmith can now recognize over 500 data types (Resource Identifiers)

Texture Set - new supported data type

New tools
- "Show File in the Viewers" allows you to select a file to be displayed in the Viewers. Found in the "Tools" menu.
- "Multifile Entry Exporter" lists and exports all (or selected) files contained in an entry. Accessed through right-clicking an entry, then select "Multifile Entry".

"Filter By" - new Find feature
- I teased the "Filter By" on Discord. This feature filters by 3D Models, Texture Maps, and LOD Selectors currently without a query.

Automatic normal map fixing
- Found in the Settings
- Thanks to @cire992 for providing details on how to fix normal maps

Rewritten texture map importer logic
- For all three games

Other changes
- several internal changes (ex: custom texconv, renamed classes, etc.)
- DDS generation fixes
- OBJ exporter fixes
- models with skeleton/skeleton-related data are handled better

Can't wait to see what you come up with next   

Oh and when will Steep support 3D models is it planned on the next update or is it when the support of the 2 AC games is completed 100%?

Well it's a good thing I just got more 3D printing filament--my "sci-fi Kassandra" may yet actually happen!

EDIT: Thank you for the search filter!  (All I want is meshes, meshes, meshes!)

EDIT 2: Protection from the user derp I mentioned earlier in the thread!

EDIT 3: Is it feasible to have the search remember your last-used parameters (even for just this session of Blacksmith)?

EDIT 4: The mesh stuff works, though given the odd coloration on the hair I probably set something wrong somewhere.  I had to delete the original head OBJ and replace it with a NURBS item because Rhino was rendering it solid black.

Dumb luck.

The head mesh name is "ACD_CHF_PLA_B01_B01_KassandraHead."

A search in DataPC_SharedGroup_00 for "kassandra," case-insensitive, filtered by "Mesh/3D Model" does NOT turn up that item.  Some other search I was doing while digging turned it up.

hello everyone, i found some body parts of the kassandra model, there is so much more tho but i don't want to spam the whole list here.
Found in: DataPC_SharedGroup_00.forge
If you scroll further down that part you'll also find the textures and other stuff which i have no idea what it all is, f.e. mipmap. Anyway i'm no modder just a desperate kass lover who'd like to get my hands on her model to play around in render programs.
Just thought it might help some of you if i put a couple of my foundings on here.

put search filter to : 'none' and case-sensitive

ACD_CHF_PLA_B01_A01_BodyKassandra
ACD_CHF_PLA_B01_B01_KassandraHead
ACD_CHF_PLA_B01_E01_KassandraEyelash
ACD_CHF_PLA_B01_F01_KassandraEyeshadow
ACD_CHF_PLA_B01_G01_KassandraSowet
ACD_CHF_PLA_B01_H01_TeethKassandra


UPDATE:
here's  a link to all the obj, textures and other stuff i managed to extract of Kassandra so far, it's a rar file [https://sta.sh/0ta9ltqm854](https://sta.sh/0ta9ltqm854)

UI resources are in DataPC_extra.forge
Look for entries with _Map suffix. Those seems to be extractable ("Texture Map" sub-section).

Most of sound data can't be converted to ogg.
When I extract AC Origins package 'sounddata/PC/sound_eng.pck', I select all of etries of this pck, then push the button 'Extract Selected'. 
Blacksmith will crash, and it extract .wem files, but I don't get any .ogg file.

Hello guys, can someone help me?
I have a problem with the body of Aya amunet, (CE_P_Aya_Amunet_body_LOD0.acor), inside CE_P_Aya_Amunet,
if I open it by Noesis, the complete model is seen, but when exporting it loses the Texturemap 
[https://drive.google.com/open?id=1TIVCb ... 2J9gD26kQ6](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1TIVCb4eWuu8QQuS7zQwAOA2J9gD26kQ6)
and when I export from the same Blacksmith parts of the model collapse.

Click the green "play" icon, that compiles and runs the code, you opened the source code archive and the file opened is the "solution" file defining what to build

Thank you very much!! Man...

I have a another question;...

The .DDS number extract from the textures of Blacksmith, and the .DDS number extract from the textures of RESOREP seem to don't mach...

It's possible to achieve a texture injecting in resorep using files i get from blacksmith?

Been looking all of this and trying to replace,(or make invisible) for the breast, bracer, and bracelet... Cause I researched those itens until  the ultimate level, and I dont like the visual of they now, trying been a long time to replace those texture, or at least make some parts transparente, to look back as a rustic item again not to much gold.

I could't find the textures and maps from those itens using resorep, Look after more then 8 thousand files, but I only found then with Blacksmith, the point is that a make some changes and resorep did not make any changes, because I think it's not the correct dds number.

For example. The last quiver research found in black smith dds adress is:

CE_P_Crafting_Quiver_07_DiffuseMap-    1579992435904     .dds

The one extracted by resorep is:                4294678141



Thank you for the attention.

What do you think about adding "full support" for Ghost Recon: Breakpoint? Beta will be online next few days 


I tried 1.9 and and I'm getting a lot of "Failed to locate the Mip0. ..." errors.

Repacking is not a goal I had in mind with Blacksmith. Blacksmith will never repack, only extract. You might be interested in Forger: [https://www.nexusmods.com/assassinscreedodyssey/mods/42](https://www.nexusmods.com/assassinscreedodyssey/mods/42)

Text files are not supported. Plus, you cannot repack files with Blacksmith.

To everyone who asked questions within the past several months:
- No second UV channel support planned as of now
- No localization help
- No repacking help
- No researching other games' files
- I am interested in translating/localizing Blacksmith into more languages. Send me a private message if you wish to help.

I only help with issues and suggestions in Blacksmith, nothing more.
