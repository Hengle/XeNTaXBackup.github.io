- Post Title: [OGG] [.SPC] Need help extracting!

Hello, I've been trying to figure out how to extract these SFX files. They are not compressed. I've been trying for several months and need your help!

[Download](http://www.mediafire.com/?3k6mm82iw6jdv5q)

I had someone create a script for the PS3, PS3 archive format is the same.... Format is the same but the actual sound file format isn't which is making it hard for me to convert the script to PC.

The process would be extracting the actual sounds first via quickbms, then replacing the header with a suitable one which allows the OGG file to be played.

Could someone help me urgently?

File info:

0x4 = UNK Endian little
0x8 = Files? Endian Little
0x10 = Files? Endian Little
0x14  = Position 1 Endian big
0x18 = Position 2 Endian big
0x1C = Data start Endian big

Regards
