- Post Title: ASTC files in CSR2

Hello everybody!

I need some help regarding CSR2's car archive files. Up until v1.11.3, car archives in the UnityCache/Shared directory were in ETC2 format. These were easily accessible and I could extract the meshes/textures from those with ease. However, with the latest update - v1.12.0 - the file extension was changed to ASTC, which makes them a texture format. The problem is, the file size of these files remain unchanged from their ETC2 versions, which implies the car objects do still exist in these.

I've tried runing these through UnityEX, but after exporting, all files are corrupted or cannot be opened properly.

Does anyone have an idea what should I do to bypass this and properly extract these?
