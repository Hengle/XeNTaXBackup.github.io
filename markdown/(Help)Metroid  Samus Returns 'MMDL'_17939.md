- Post Title: (Help)Metroid : Samus Returns 'MMDL'

Hello its me.
A while back I asked for help with the pkg archives for Metroid : Samus Returns 
and was assisted by "AceWell"
And that got me only one step farther as I was quickly derailed by how little I could comprehend the models
I hope someone could help me
thanks in advance

Here is a mesh from "system_2.MMDL"


There are offsets and counts in the beginning of the file. For example vertex count and offset at 0x180, index count and offset at 0x2E0. So you can find the model data easily that way.
