Hi
Here is an importer for planes from this game.
It requires Blender version 249b and Python 2.6.6.
How to use:
1.create new folder e.g. "E:\\World of Planes"
2.copy folder "aircrafts" from  "...\Games\World_of_Warplanes\res\scripts\db" to "World of Planes".
3.unpack all vehicles_airplane_....pkg files - use your favorite unpacker. (7zip,Winrar)
4.move folder "vehicles" from each unpacked pkg files to folder "World of Planes"
5.run Blender249.blend
6.in Blender Text Window- go to line 99 and paste your path to "World of Planes". 
7.save blend
8.one more time press alt+p and select  xml file from  "aircrafts" folder.

Textures are not complete. It imports only detail textures.
For fx-meshes uv is wrong.
Script is free. 
I used for decoding strings: [viewtopic.php?p=43825#p43825](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?p=43825#p43825)

Oh!
I figured out what the problem was. I installed python x32 instead of x64 (. I apologize. And thank you, that vie responded!
