- Post Title: Lamp of Alladin - Archive

I'll appreciate any help or guidance to unpack the "*.boo"-archive from the "Lamp of Alladin" game. 
The head.bin and tail.bin may be downloaded here: [http://www.motionpress.com/uploads/Lamp ... adTail.rar](http://www.motionpress.com/uploads/LampOfAlladinHeadTail.rar)

Thanks in advance!
