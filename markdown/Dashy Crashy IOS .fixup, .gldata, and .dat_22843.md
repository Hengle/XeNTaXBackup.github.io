- Post Title: Dashy Crashy IOS .fixup, .gldata, and .dat

I can't figure out how to unpack these files. There's game_assets.dat,fixup,gldata, and gameassets_64.dat,fixup. There is ui_assets which is like the game_assets file. How do I unpack these?
Assets: [http://www.mediafire.com/file/qm2fzhxjg ... y.zip/file](http://www.mediafire.com/file/qm2fzhxjgbrxyeu/DashyCrashy.zip/file)
I'm not sure which one contains the actual game assets. Can somebody help me?

Oops, can somebody move this to the game archive forum?
