- Post Title: Street Racing Syndicate Car Extract (.ar File)

Well... i seen a topic that has discussion about .ar files... but it's Racer.nl's .ar file. What i'm talking about is this game made by Namco for PS2, PC, and XBOX. Street Racing Syndicate. This game was not so popular. I Hate the sexy girls... pisses me off... well, what i'm trying to ask here is about extracting the .ar file. I got the game and it's located on "SRS Game Root Folder>Data>archive.ar(1,162,226 KB)"
Other files on the game folder were not as big as that. The Game size is around 1.71 GB. Videos are 569 MB. And 21.2 MB for Bin folder. Doc folder is around 12 KB. So i knew that the Car Models, Wheels Models, Parts Models, and Textures were packed on that .ar file. My question is : Can Anyone on this forum make a BMS script to extract the .ar files? and maybe making the car files into some useful formats like .obj. If nobody cant make the car files into useful formats when the game is extractable, then i need Oleg from ZModeler 2 Forum... So please... Someone please make an extractor for this. I'm desperate to get my hands on some C-WEST Nissan Skyline GT-R R34. I ripped one b4 but the models was way too messy to be in GTA San Andreas.

And sorry if i post this topic on a wrong place. I'm a newbie on XeNTaX Forum.
