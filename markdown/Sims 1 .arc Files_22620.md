- Post Title: Sims 1 .arc Files

Does anyone know of a BMS script for Sims 1 PS2 archives? I've tried probably every single script I could find around here but I could only get the Bustin Out script to work on the QUICKDAT archive. I'm looking to extract audiostr.arc and SAMPLES.ARC. You can find one of them below.
