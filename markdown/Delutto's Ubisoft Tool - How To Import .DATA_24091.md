- Post Title: Delutto's Ubisoft Tool - How To Import .DATA

Please read this first before continuing, it is important that you know this:

I would like to thank Delutto for this magnificent tool that has served many of us, but not others. So I have come to fix this misunderstanding with Delutto and his followers. The tool is 100% functional and has no fault, despite the fact that many said that the import system was failing, since the file we edited, it was always replaced by the original file. I've been looking for a way to fix this (I'm not a moderator), I looked for everything on programming and nothing. 
While reading many forums on the subject, I came across certain comments that said "you have selected the wrong folder", but did not explain why. So I started looking for more answers in forums around the world, such as Russia, Hungary, Thailand, and among others who were looking to translate versions of AC, such as Odyssey and Unity into their native language, (And that I'm from Latin America) . 
They all said the same thing, "The import system is damaged", but there was always one that said "Wrong folder", so I decided to pay attention to the "wrong folder" thing. So I did about 10 tests and finally found the flaw, "We were selecting the wrong folder". So let's get started.


1. The first thing you have to do is create a folder on the desktop. (Give it whatever name you want)



2. Inside that folder, create one with the name "Ubisoft_DATA_Tool_By_Delutto" or whatever you like.



3. Extract the file "Ubisoft_DATA_Tool_By_Delutto.7z" inside the created folder.



4. In this step, I will use an AC4 file called 2115-CHR_U_adewale.data, this step will skip it, because we all know how to extract.



5. They edit the file they want. In my case I will use HxD (a hexadecimal program) to edit the Visual_Master.Build_Table file for testing. As you can see in the image, the first frame is the edited file (I wrote down numbers and letters on the rise) and the second is the original file.



6. Save the file and we go to the tool to import our edited file.



7. We select our Adewale .data to continue with the important step, the folder selection.



8. Now in this image is our mistake and that of everyone in the world. Extracting the file "2115-CHR_U_adewale.data" creates the folder "2115-CHR_U_adewale" containing all the .data files. Our mistake in the folder selection was that we always selected the folder of the .data file that we wanted to edit. But it turns out that this "NOT" is the folder to select, but the folder (in my case) "Ubisoft_DATA_Tool_By_Delutto", the folder containing the tool and the files.



9. This is the folder that we have to select, the one that contains the tool and the .data, not the one for the .data files, but the one for "the tool". We select the folder and continue.


10. Well, here we have our file "2115-CHR_U_adewale.data.NEW" that the Delutto tool creates.



11. Here they delete the .NEW so that they change the format to .data. Here I put "Adewale123" to extract it again and verify if I save the .data with my edited file.



12. I open my edited file and "YES", as you can see, I save with the edited file, not with the original. Check out step 5 to see the file I edited.



13.  Here I deleted my edited file and extracted the original again and you will see that the hexadecimal codes are different.



14.  And voila, this is the "Big" problem of importing the Delutto tool. I hope this has been helpful to you.


With this im out. Delutto's problem was that he did not explain the import system very well, so we did it as we imported the .forge, but the big problem was that some knew how to do it well and remained silent, and some said about the problem , but they did not explain. I sincerely thank Delutto for their support of the community of moderators, but we did not receive it very well, so I want everyone to get up from where they are, cross their arms and say "Delutto forever". Now if you go through this process and it doesn't work for you, I guarantee that there is something wrong with your computers, because mine is a toaster and it worked great. Well greetings to all and I hope you are in good health and happiness.
