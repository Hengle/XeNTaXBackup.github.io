- Post Title: Where is the rewind section text file in 'TWD Season 1'

Hi everybody:

I have the next problem.



wea.jpg (106.84 KiB) Viewed 60 times



I want to change the text below the photo (Capítulo 5: Motel) but I can't find the file. I've checked all the content inside every .landb file and I don't see anything. It must be in another file.

Someone would know where I can find the file with this text by any chance?

Thanks.

You've talked about .prop files and I can see there is one file of that type inside it. The only .prop files related with the rewind menu that I found are those:

But how can I open them? I don't find anything about it on Internet.
