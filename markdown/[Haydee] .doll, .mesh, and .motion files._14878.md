- Post Title: [Haydee] .doll, .mesh, and .motion files.

I unpacked this Haydee actor .pack, now I got these three different files. So did anyone find a max script or made a max script for Haydee models and motions. I sure would appreciate it. 

Here is .doll of haydee. [https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/zqf ... .doll?dl=0](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/zqf5ba7tkwtoiko/Haydee.doll?dl=0) 

Here is .motion [https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/fxx ... otion?dl=0](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/fxxuv98f7q3b57t/AimIdle.motion?dl=0) 

Here is .mesh [https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/1th ... .mesh?dl=0](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/1th871ms1i36z4g/Hair.mesh?dl=0)

BadhornStadnent,

I added the Haydee .mesh/mtl loader module to the 3D Object Converter [http://3doc.i3dconverter.com](http://3doc.i3dconverter.com).
I released it as a web update, so just use the Help/Check for updates... function to get it.

Hi!
Would You consider adding .mesh exporter too? The game become huge success apparently, for some reason   .
I'm sure few people would buy Your converter just for that, like...  my friend

Haydee author just released the Modding tools. Seems to be the Haydee model in Max format, and a 3dsMax Exporter script for their format. Can probably use that to reverse engineer an importer.  Seems to include an archive packer/unpacker and possibly a level editor too (though I can't get it to run, and no docs yet).
