I've made a tool to view/extract these archives some time ago.
You can download it from [http://gamefileformats.the-underdogs.in ... orer10.zip](http://gamefileformats.the-underdogs.info/files/bs4explorer10.zip)
It's in German but should be easy to use. If you have questions just ask.

Thanks john_doe for the BS4 extractor.

Did you have coded or know if exists a tool to recreate the pack files? I'm asking this because our team want to translate the game, and no luck until now for such a tool.

Thanks!
