- Post Title: How to edit the MainData file? (extract and repack) [HELP]

Well guys, I've been trying to open a file Main Date of the game The Forest. The game uses Unity 4, and the .assets editor does not work in this file because it has no extension, appears only file. Could help me extract the text and make the repack them again because a long time, I've been trying to translate it, but I can not extract, edit and repackage the files again. I would be very grateful if someone could help me.

Follow the link below the file you wish to edit the texts.
