You can use Aluigi's offzip commandline tool. [http://aluigi.org/mytoolz/offzip.zip](http://aluigi.org/mytoolz/offzip.zip)

Here is the file decompressed.  Zlib is pretty easy to decompress, it's totally open source, and easy to make your own decompressor if needed, but as was mentioned, Offzip and I even think QuickBMS will do it for you.
