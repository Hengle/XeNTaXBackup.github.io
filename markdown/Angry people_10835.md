Just thought I'd might open an thread for any messages sent to us by disgruntled people.  

Most of those have this effect:   

Here's one we got today from someone named A. Stones:

> First off I want to say, How dare you people charge for registration to a forum. you are scamming people out of their hard earned money, it is criminal that you are forcing people to donate so they can post or download attachments,
>
> Also removing outside links from posts because it gives people a way of avoiding your begging for money ? SHAME on all of you ... this site will NEVER get any money from me or any of my friends, I have black listed this site as nothing more than a huge scam and will make sure as many people as possible know about this scam.

Every sentence in that letter has WRONG written all over it.

My reaction to it, mostly:


On another note, I'm not sure if that sob is serious (albeit oblivious) or just plain trolling.

Here's another, be it more civilized letter:

> Hello - I am posting this to ask if I can get an account on Xentax. I want an account simply to contribute to the research done on GTA V (for the Xbox specifically), but cannot due to the fact that I cannot register an account without donating.
>
>     I can assure you that I will not pay for an account to contribute to a forum that shows great interest in open game modifications and research. The thread I am specifically refering to is this one, and I find it quite ridiculous that many are complaining about software developers releasing only screenshots of GTA V modification programs, but at the same time - you guys are charging to contribute to the free and open research of GTA.
>
>     Now, don't take this the wrong way, I just said what I think is true. I understand that you guys have bills to meet, and I'm sure that's why you are charging to register an account. I am just hinting you on to reconsider, with the fact in mind - contributing to a thread that believes in free, open source research should additionally be free, and charging to help your forum just seems crazy. Free, open source, and public research is the best - and this problem seems to be reducing the amount of information available to the public (because I'm sure I'm not the only one who'd like to contribute and help).
>
>     Again, don't take this the wrong way - I'm just suggesting here. If I didn't care, I wouldn't have taken the time to write this email. I am just concerned because the thread has great information (the best anywhere on the web), but I cannot contribute.

And my reply:

> Your points are understood. Still, this forum has been around for 10 years, and only this year we had to start asking for donations, since Google Ads and Google continously start to protest at our content, primed so by disgruntled users. We had to find other means to keep it up. Also, it's nothing like a subscription, as it is one time only, for a life time of access. Additionally, the 5 euro donation is the lowest possible. If you can get into the forum for 1 year or more, based on your own interest, there after, you can calculate the actual cost per month (40 cents, for two years 20 cents, for three years 10 cents etc.). You cannot call that having to pay any substantial amount that warrants your purist (and archaic, if I may add) stand on "open information". Besides, the forum text is completely open for anyone to read. An added benefit of this method of forum entry is that spammers and fools are not registering, it keeps the forum clean of people that just want a quick-fix, and brings in the more serious users. Nevertheless, if anyone can show us that they mean well and have stuff to offer to contribute and promote our community via one or the other, they get registration without having to donate a single buck. We've added people this way in the past, so there. Anything is possible.

[Here's one I found](http://ioscheaters.com/topic/593-gameloft-glitch-engine-gla-file-modding/#entry8084) while searching for how far my Gameloft GLA extractor has spread. I guess the problem is people from outside XeNTaX are usually more interested in leeching the tools rather than contributing back. I signed up before the forums started requesting donation to register, but I made it up by getting a copy of MultiEx Commander.

I didn't really mind donating to get in, but I will admit: I was a bit tithed when I had to wait until my account was activated to actually log in. Are there really still spammers or other malicious users actually paying money to try to register?!

It's leechers like these that annoy me the most, Everyone here that has made extraction tools have posted it on this forum as attachements for a reason, if they wanted their tools to be available off site then they would. So anyone claiming they have the right to download tools that other people have made without contributing in any way is pretty upsetting. They're the type of people that would download scripts and not even leave a 'thanks' message.

My only real problem is seeing ads appearing inside people's posts now. It looks like it's the beginning part of their post itself. I'm not sure when this actually started, or if it's even directly related, but I noticed it at the same time I noticed that this change was introduced.

Just my opinion here:

I'm here from many years and I have seen that a forum free to anyone first introduced advertising everywhere that became more invasive, then forced donations (forum no longer free) and now it's even closed to public.

I guess that many people like me joined the forum to help others and sharing knowledge, and not for having their work shared only to a limited amount of paying people.

As far as I understand the main problem are the copyright complains and the costs, correct?

Is it possible to have some statistics about these complains?
I have read the recent blog post and basically it seems that have been received 1000 complains, so it looks like maintaining the Xentax forum is very expensive and dangerous... at this point why continuing to keep it open in this status?

Don't get me wrong, I'm really interested because the only complain I remember was something of many years ago (but don't remember) and I don't think it's necessary an expensive powerful dedicated server with lot of space for the forum.

With MultiEx and Noesis downloads no longer being hosted here, I'd be pretty surprised if the bandwidth usage is still really all that high. So if bandwidth cost is still an issue, I would just go with shared hosting at this point, it's very cheap (usually 100-200 per year) and most shared hosting services will just throttle you when you exceed a certain cap rather than hitting you with fees and higher costs. I move hundreds of gigs per month on mine with my various projects and have never even noticed any throttling.

Cracking down on copyrighted and/or illegal file distribution is still the right thing either way, though. It's only a matter of time before full internet fascism kicks in across the globe.

I was actually thinking about this and i guess i will offer Mr.Mouse to move the site to my ded. server(very powerfull) if he want to. But before this can happens i need to know some stats, how much load this site will generate and then we can remove some ads and might some other things from the posts. Not sure what Mr.Mouse want to do with the site, but i can also help with transfer  Will see... ill try to speak to him.

Well, first off, the forum is taking most of the bandwidth. 
Second, the ads were more invasive now because Adsense no longer wants to do business with us and we had to look for alternatives, as well as close the forum for the general public (because we were getting notifications of this or that breach on a monthly basis, and believe me when I say I do not have the time for this bullshit each and everytime). PayPal also closed us off and took our money for hostage - it was only my compulsory complaining with them that made them release the money (but still close us off for further business). They reassessed our site after the changes I made and concluded it was of "limited risk". But would conduct a further analysis and block the account. 

I intend to look into the matter of reopening the forum for public viewing at least. I also think that the ads are not effective at all at the moment, so they may go. I am just making sure the funds are there. 

Hopefully, I won't have to explain myself why we are doing this the current way. I was on the brink of closing this forum altogether but decided not to (yet). Yes, the forum is open for posting only to those who donate a little, and only a one time donation is all there is to it. It certainly keeps a lot of trash outside, and there are alternative ways to register at the forum for those worthy enough.

The coming week(s) will see probably the public reopening of the forum for viewing, and the ads gone. I may even be tempted to bring back the wiki. I spent 11 years on this forum since I started it, dedicated a hell of a lot of time to it that has been a waste if it will have to stop.  We have a good host that is ready for us 24/7 and also that is better than running our own server with the time we got on our hands (next to nil).

Thanks for the information, Mr Mouse.

I guess there are some alternatives to solve the problem.

What I think is that the content released till now is too much and too valuable to be made private and going lost from the search engines.
In this case you may opt for a "historic" section which goes public and all the rest (the new posts) kept private as is now.
Basically, what is done is done and it's already "sanitized" (links removed, edited threads and so on), so it should be no longer a problem.

Regarding the new users and those who desire to talk more in deep about some topics, it's possible to redirect them to other resources.
I have a possible project in mind and I guess it may be useful to remove some "pressure" from Xentax.

I was re-reading what you wrote and, apparently, the copyright issues are not related to the server itself but only to the money-related services (ads and paypal), is it correct?
Being the server hosted in US I would have expected more complain.

I'm new here and I had no issue with making a donation to access the forum. It's a fair trade when you consider all of the information and software provided here, and it isn't like you guys are asking for a fortune. I wish I could contribute, but me not knowing a single programming language doesn't do me any favors.

Very mature move to remove the link to a free resource, my compliments.
Almost mature like having a thread where you joke and insult people who don't like your forum for various reasons that it's hard to claim are false or wrong.

Yes, we're all very mature. Apparently. How it looks is: you post a message in a forum that's been around since 2003 and say: everybody! Come here instead! 

I find that odd, perhaps even impertinent. At any other forum, if I did something like that, I'd probably be banned straightaway. Surely you agree.   But after some consideration, I have returned the link for your personal benefit.

True. However, I do find it ...amusing... to see that Aluigi uses the name ZENHAX. I also see that the forum titles are the same as over here. 
What I find equally ...interesting... is that he states that it is quite "normal" that posts are deleted or changed at this forum.

I have never said that people must move from here to there.
That's even written in the FAQ where I call my project a "complement".

Till a week ago Xentax was closed to public, full of advertisements, payware, no wiki and with tons of posts edited.
In fact in my post of some days ago I already introduced this idea, I don't remember anyone discussed about that idea or was interested in it.

The names of the main sections are the same with my descriptions, and so?
Xentax is a known community and people will find it confortable to see those sections.

Zenhax is a name with a logic, there is even the explanation of the name in the FAQ.

The layout is the default subsilver2 of phpbb3.

And yes, it's normal to see edited posts on Xentax due to the link policy and other reasons, it's a fact that anyone can see by viewing the current and old posts.

Well, I don't think I need to discuss semantics. The intent is quite clear. 

I do notice there are some rules for this new forum of yours as well. It will be interesting to see how these rules can be enforced without a single edit to a post, or other intervention by moderation. All big forums have moderators to ensure things go the way they need to be. This has been so for decades since the early bulletin boards. And for a good reason as well. Nothing new there.

Part of the celebration of the 25th anniversary is free forum access. For less than two days now already. Over 130 new "members"

And guess what, Aluigi, the first spammers have already entered the building. And yes, anti-spam control is in place, these are humans.
[viewtopic.php?f=40&t=11765](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=40&t=11765)

I also got messages from members that hope that we restrict access to this forum as it was, so only serious members get in. Well, we'll see. 

For now it's a free forum as stated.

I personally see no reason why these people are being "made fun of" for having a different opinion on what was done. And personally I agree with those people. I was someone that refused to ever pay to be part of this site because to me I found it criminal what was being done. You literally stole public information for personal gain by locking it behind a required donation. The forum was free and open to the public for years, where people posted and shared public information, then you decide to lock it behind a paywall. 

Did you get written permission from every public contributor before you moved to a paywall asking if they were ok with you profiting off their work? No, I really doubt that. Regardless if you want to state it was for costs or for profit, the fact of the matter is what was done is basically illegal, and on some ways could be considered extortion. Having new information going forward be locked and old information still public would have been a better way to handle the choice of going paid vs. free.

If you don't have time to be a host of a website then pass it to someone else. Dealing with things like that are part of the job.

> Reply from Mr.Mouse
>

And just like everyone you made fun of, the same can be done for you here. You disagree with what someone did as a result of your actions, but it's ok for you to make the site paid and expect everyone to be ok with it? 
Seems kind of hypocritical.

Again, if you can't handle being the host, pass it to someone else. Holding other peoples work and efforts hostage is literally doing you nothing but problems as you are putting it. Based on your posts in this thread, you don't give people much of a reason to trust this site will be free or even online the next day.

And the same can be said by every contributor of this forum. To have an admin that may just randomly enforce payments or even just randomly shut down the forum because of his own ego makes people uneasy and upset. From your responses in this thread, you don't give people much reason to want to stay on this forum or continue contributing to it. On one hand you seem dedicated to keeping the site around, then on the other you seem quick to blame the community and want to just shut it down and run. 

I see nothing wrong with people feeling uneasy, and wanting to open alternatives in case the site does shutdown without warning.

> Yes, we're all very mature. Apparently. How it looks is: you post a message in a forum that's been around since 2003 and say: everybody! Come here instead! 

I find that odd, perhaps even impertinent. At any other forum, if I did something like that, I'd probably be banned straightaway. Surely you agree.   But after some consideration, I have returned the link for your personal benefit.

I see nothing wrong with what aluigi did. He gave people a free alternative to post their public and free information in the event this site decides to start charging again or disappear altogether. There is no law stating he can't host a site similar to the purpose of this one. If anything it just seems more like you are butthurt that someone else is doing the same thing as you so you no longer have an easy ability to make this site paid for again in the future because they have somewhere else to go now.

I posted several things here, shared my time and work to help others while gaining nothing back but a simple thanks. I include a donation link with most of my work if people feel inclined to send a thanks back that way, but rarely ever does that happen. Sure it sucks that not many people want to offer anything for my time and efforts, but to have a site take my public and free work/information and start charging for it is definitely the worse of the two. I would rather not post here at all anymore and have all my posts removed than to see a paywall go back up and have my personal work locked behind a required payment that someone else is pocketing. If you want to charge people for your personal work, posts, and programs go for it. But to charge them for other peoples contributions, work, and programs is a totally shit thing to do.

> I personally see no reason why these people are being "made fun of" for having a different opinion on what was done. And personally I agree with those people. I was someone that refused to ever pay to be part of this site because to me I found it criminal what was being done. You literally stole public information for personal gain by locking it behind a required donation. The forum was free and open to the public for years, where people posted and shared public information, then you decide to lock it behind a paywall.

I'm really sorry to hear, that you feel the people who have contested the forum Admin's decision to accept donations in-order to have an account, are being made fun of. I would like to assure you that this thread is clearly nothing more than bringing awareness to the situation and gain more feedback from forum users. I do feel that you are slightly mis-informed. Nobody has "stole" information, anyone who is logged out has access to everything standard users do except viewing attatchments and posting thus there is no information that has been "stolen". It may seem like an irrational reason to make the said change but the justification provided in the first post is more than enough to understand why this route had been taken.

Did you get written permission from every public contributor before you moved to a paywall asking if they were ok with you profiting off their work? No, I really doubt that. Regardless if you want to state it was for costs or for profit, the fact of the matter is what was done is basically illegal, and on some ways could be considered extortion. Having new information going forward be locked and old information still public would have been a better way to handle the choice of going paid vs. free.

When everyone joined this forum they were made aware of [Xentax Forum's terms of use agreement.](http://forum.xentax.com/ucp.php?mode=terms) To quote "As a user you agree to any information you have entered to being stored in a database." Thus no permission is required. The decision was nothing to do with making profit from other people's work. This is cleared up in the first post of this thread.

And just like everyone you made fun of, the same can be done for you here. You disagree with what someone did as a result of your actions, but it's ok for you to make the site paid and expect everyone to be ok with it? 
Seems kind of hypocritical.

Not hypocritical, this thread's purpose is to bring the situation to light so that everyone understands why said decisions were made. You are in your rights to disagree with anything you wish, it's unfortunate your post so far contests the system yet a lot of the reasoning behind actions have been cleared up and you don't acknowledge this to help move the discussion forward.

I don't understand why this is now being twisted into something else. Nobody's work is being held hostage, if you sign out you will clearly see everyone who is signed out has access to the same information as those who are signed in.

Aluigi is fine to make his own forum, but he can't just post the link here. It's advertising which affects the site's traffic and community quite drastically. Due to the similar nature of that forum, it could also be considered a clone/impersonation of this forum. We cannot be held accountable for something that happens off-site because a user clicked that link and ended up in trouble thinking it's the same website when it's not. We value our community and wish to ensure everyone remains safe at the cost of certain measures being put in place. I am tempted to flat out delete that link but unfortunately I cannot override the Admin's decision to reinstate it.

Nobody has suggested that Aluigi cannot create a similar website. It's not against the law as you said, that is right. However, understand that XeNTaX staff reserve the right to remove content off this forum at their own discretion as stated in the terms of use agreement.

The problem boiled down to Google Ads no longer supporting this website. As a result, the donation system is the only current solution (from what I am understanding) to ensure the website stays up. This is not about profiting from other people's work but simply to have an account here.

After reading through your post it is quite possible you are being defamatory towards XeNTaX forums. I say this because a lot of what you posted is based off assumptions, already cleared up or flat out wrong/made up to make the site seem like it has sinister motives when it's not the case. I would like to remind you that hostility towards XeNTaX members or staff is not permitted and stirring up nonsense in an attempt to defame the forum isn't either. Please be careful as future instances may result in warnings or suspensions applied to your account.

I understand your frustration but please also respect the forum rules. Frustration is not going to help move things forward, discussing things in a respectful manner is what we expect of this community and try our hardest to enforce.

Cheers.

Pretty much the kind of response I expected from you.

Indeed? Then you must be a troll, responding to a discussion that was more than 3 years old. 
That's what anyone would call a necropost. And that is a sin, as you too must know. 

Also, you don't seem to have your facts straight: 
1. This forum is free for anyone since that particular discussion above, so for years up until this day. Also, it has been free for anyone a decade before that discussion.  Your necropost just doesn't make any sense, unless it is to create confusion. Which would be pretty dumb, but then... trolls usually are.  
2.  As Gh0stblade pointed out to you as well, nothing - no information - is held hostage. The site only requires registration to post and download stuff, but registration is free to do, and has a very valid reason, besides the ones mention by Gh0stblade: stop spammers. We want this forum clean of spammers and leechers. 
3. Aluigi and I have been in contact since the above discussion and we have cleared the air on this already years ago. We bear eachother no grudges, we're totally fine. 
4. However, you seem to have a grudge, I just suggest you don't hold that grudge on Aluigi's behalf. Since he has none. It wouldn't be fair to him and I'm sure he would disagree with you. 

As to point 4, it is clear you bear us ill will, based on your post history and the editing that you have done. Here's an example attached below. 
You urge people to go to YOUR site as well, besides Aluigi's. Funny that. Dragging Aluigi in your personal vendetta. 
Anyhow, necroposters are usually bad company. Your posts tell us more about you than anything else.
