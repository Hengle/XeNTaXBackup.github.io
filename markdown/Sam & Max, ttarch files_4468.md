- Post Title: Sam & Max, ttarch files

Hello there!
I'm from Poland, and I want to translate this game. files are packed in ttarch files. On this forum I found [this](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=3254&st=0&sk=t&sd=a) topic. I found this - [http://aluigi.org/papers.htm#ttarchext](http://aluigi.org/papers.htm#ttarchext). But when I'm trying to run it, cmd opens for a second and closes. Also, I can download only version 0.1.10, but author said that there are new versions.

it's a command-line tool so it must be launched from the console (cmd.exe), search on internet if you don't have experience with it or take a look [here](http://aluigi.org/about.htm#howuse)
