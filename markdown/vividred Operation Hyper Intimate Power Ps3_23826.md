superch exe, for phyre engine, by daemon actually works with the character models(i only tried those)
However, textures won't work unlike the other games (example: uta kumi 575)

sample tex and how it comes out
edit: a friend suggested it might be morton order, if that helps
edit 2: confirm it's just ps3 swizzle, also textures really sucks.
