- Post Title: Need Help Extracting Legend of Cao Cao Files

Does anyone know how to extract files for Nexon's Legend of Cao Cao? I used to be able to rip them without any fuss using Unity Ex, but the latest update has rendered that method useless by making them unreadable. Samples of the files can be found right here: [link](http://www.mediafire.com/file/vecox1t1225flhd/Legend_of_Cao_Cao_Files.zip/file)

I hope I'm not asking too much here. All I want is a way to get these files extracted properly.

I finally solved my problem! It took me a while to come up with a solution, but now I'm able to get the graphics I want with these steps.

1. Open Unity Assets Bundle Extractor.
2. Create bundle pack per file.
3. Check the info of the CAB- file.
4. Click on the Texture2D file you wish to extract.
5. Click Plugins and choose Export to .png, then rename it however you wish.

your samples extract in one step with "Asset Studio" (formerly Unity Studio).
