- Post Title: Andari Systems Configurators  (.bin models)

Has anyone tried to convert the models from these configurators yet?

The textures are simple .jpg.  The models however are a combination of .bin and a javascript which implies a .obj was the original format.
Here is an M4 from the iPad app as an example: [http://www.mediafire.com/file/q5y311wwa ... BMW_M4.zip](http://www.mediafire.com/file/q5y311wwalcbrvn/BMW_M4.zip)
