I have just reversed the algorithm which, ironically, was also very very easy.
I have implemented it natively in [quickbms 0.3.4b](http://aluigi.org/papers.htm#quickbms) and it's needed the usual [zip.bms script](http://aluigi.org/papers/bms/zip.bms) to extract all the files.

Somebody can tell me how I can repack the file?
Because extract I know, but repack them I don't know.

rezipping them with a normal program (7zip, winzip and so on) should work
