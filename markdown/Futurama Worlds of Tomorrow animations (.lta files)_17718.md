- Post Title: Futurama: Worlds of Tomorrow animations (.lta files)

Hi everyone, just trying to view the animations from this game - I can open the texture files okay, but by the look of it the character is split into pieces, so it can be applied to a skeletal animation, which I'm fairly certain is the .lta file. Trouble is, I have no idea how to view these files! Here is an example .lta and its corresponding texture, in both the original astc.ccz and .png format: [https://www.dropbox.com/s/2e9mhs7ldit8h ... 8.zip?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/2e9mhs7ldit8hz9/PF0001-dialogue1-008.zip?dl=0)

I suspect it may be similar to Family Guy the Quest for Stuff if it helps, a similar game by the same company. Does anyone have any idea on these?

Update, something that may narrow it down (or not), when I open the file in a txt viewer, I can recognise strings that I think are the names of the animations amongst the other data, so does that mean they're not encrypted/compressed? In that case, does anyone know how I could proceed from there or what I should be looking for?
