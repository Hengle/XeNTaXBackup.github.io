- Post Title: Looking for help opening Metroid Dread Gravity Suit model

Hi, Im sorry if this is a dumb question but im new to this stuff. Im trying to find a way to view a 3d model of the gravity suit from metroid dread for referencing. I have all the files extracted and have found files like Samus.pkg or Gravity_body_at.bctex etc but I have no idea exactly which files I need or what program to use to get a good clean view of the full model. Im going to be using it as reference to make 3d models to print as wearable armor so movement isnt necessary.

Thank you in advance!
