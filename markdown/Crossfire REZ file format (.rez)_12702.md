- Post Title: Crossfire REZ file format (*.rez)

Hello. I have archive file format for you skilled reverse engineers. It's from crossfire online (the Chinese version) 
You can check the game here: [http://cf.qq.com/main.shtml](http://cf.qq.com/main.shtml)

I have uploaded 2 samples, in earlier game versions the archive type were supposed by a tool called cfrez, however those archives I'm sending you looks like split archives, and cfrez no longer supports them... I have uploaded 2 of them (they are 9), if someone wants I can upload them all (on dropbox)

[https://www.dropbox.com/s/kzzw7tj8q73c4 ... 7.rez?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/kzzw7tj8q73c4ec/rf017.rez?dl=0)

[https://www.dropbox.com/s/d8kviqbd5ny38 ... 1.rez?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/d8kviqbd5ny389l/rf017_1.rez?dl=0)

like you see from the names of the archives, they really look like split archives, the file names are rf017.rez, rf017_1.rez ...... fr017_8.rez

Those archives are supposed to contain *.dtx texture files. Any help will be appreciated. 

Thanks for the time and understanding.
