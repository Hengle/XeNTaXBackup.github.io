The models for the maps in Raging Blast are likely encrypted differently from the characters themselves. I've been able to rip textures from the maps, but as for the actual geometry, there's nothing there. You likely can rip the textures for the models themselves with the current plugin for Noesis, but either the .VRAM or .IORAM are encoded differently from what the plugin reads. Other than that, I haven't the slightest idea as to how to get them ripped. Sorry.
