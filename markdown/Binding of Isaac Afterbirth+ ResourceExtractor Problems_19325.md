- Post Title: Binding of Isaac Afterbirth+ ResourceExtractor Problems

Hi guys, I know the game is old but I can't for the life of me get the ResourceExtractor.exe to extract anything. I just get a list of warnings in the command prompt window with nothing extracted. I want to extract afterbirth.a to get at the sprites. What should I do?

Thanks.
