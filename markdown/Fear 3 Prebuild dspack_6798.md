can you upload the crc.map file you got from Audio.dspack?

the file that was provided didn't contain compressed files so I needed to guess these fields, that's why it's not working.
for the moment I have checked various algorithms but without much luck

This was the "Pre/BETA" - Release.

THX for try out.   

I/WE hope the Final-Rel/STEAM/DVD-Version had another BETTER filesystem, that this one.

anyway, considering that the only limitation at the moment is the compression algorithm, I guess I will reverse when the game will be released.
so don't get mad for the moment :)

Has anyone found a way to set subtitles in another language? for instance english voices and spanish subs.

Both english and spanish dspack files contain no files regarding subs or text.

Nvm: I just set the language in the ini file and renamed english to spanish.dspack

Provided file does not contain a compressed file, so I need to guess in these areas, which is why it does not work. Currently I have checked, but not much luck of the various algorithms....

I don't know what's the correct script for this specific game/version.

maybe others that I don't remember
