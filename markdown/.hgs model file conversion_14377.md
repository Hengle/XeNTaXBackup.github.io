- Post Title: .hgs model file conversion

Hey guys,
I have a .hgs model file from the game "Monopoly" (Steam version by Sperasoft) and i dont know how to open that file format. Noesis cant read that format.
Its 100% a model file, cause the name of the folder called "models". Iam trying to open this file with a hex editor (Hxd) and iam found some strings like "HG3D" (at the head), "root", "skeleton", "car_mat" and so on. Iam try to searching for this file extension, but i found only hgs = harvard graphics.
But i dont know, if its the right keyword for that.

About the game files & folder structures i believe, some hgs files contain animations, too.

Can someone help me please? I searching for a few days for that and its hard to find about that...   


Best regards,
NJ

Once you've found out that the FVFsize (vertex stride) is 56 here the format appears to be pretty simple:

Just re-script it using the video, and stop being so demanding.

@mariokart64n
you should consider moving all your tutorial links to a new thread in the "Tutorials" section of the forum like what daemon1 did so they don't get buried and lost  

@PhillipGamer3264
are you refering to yourself in 3rd person? it is very confusing
