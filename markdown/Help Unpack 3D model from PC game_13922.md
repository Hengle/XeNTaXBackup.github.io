- Post Title: Help Unpack 3D model from PC game

Hey guys, ive gone through your forums, tutorials etc , downloaded a bunch of tools including zlibc_gui_decompressor , but can't get this model open.

Hex edit says theres bones etc there, but the header dosen't say its compressed format, any ideas guys ?

Thanks mate,thats it....  hex2obj the one i didn't try, because i thought i had to decompress .bin 1st. Awesome, will go through your tuts, but basically what i'm understanding is different areas in the hex of the file will have the parts of the model. Cheers
