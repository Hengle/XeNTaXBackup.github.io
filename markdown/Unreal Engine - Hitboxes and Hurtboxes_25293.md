- Post Title: Unreal Engine - Hitboxes and Hurtboxes

hi,   

So i've been trying to mod unreal engine games for a while now and i know how to do some basic stuff. 
Something i don't know yet but i really want to know about and figure out how it works are the hitboxes and hurtboxes (or collisions whatever you prefer naming it). I don't know where to find it. Could i find it in the blueprint file of an object or model? Or is it somewhere at a completely different location? I have been trying for a while, but i see no result and i'm still here with the same knowledge as at the moment i started trying. 

Hopefully someone can help me out here.

Collisions are held within the static mesh or skeletal mesh.
If its an animation then a hitbox may be custom to specific frames of the animation.
