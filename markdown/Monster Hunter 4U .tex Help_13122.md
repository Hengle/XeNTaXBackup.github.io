Sorry I know it's not wise to open a new tread here with these problem.

But I've been a lot of research, and still couldn't find any solution as well as reply from the people who are doing it.

I'm here request help from professionals who could help me to convert Monster Hunter 4U .tex file into a usable format such as dds, tga etc.

I've attached an example below for you guys to download and convert.

Thank you very much.
