- Post Title: KwonHo .PAQ files

I've opened KwonHo, an online fighting game that has many features, and was abandoned by HanGames/Ijji. At a certain time, I've faced some .PAQ files, that hold the gross of all data of the game. But I've found nothing that can help me to open/uncompress/extract/whatever them.

Would somebody send me a light?

I'm back, and tried every ways to uncompress the .PAQ, until the HP backup and Winzip, that (said) would uncompress .PAQ files. And nothing.

My plan is to make this game playable offline, once that Hangames/Ijji has abandoned it.

The .PAQ sample link is still working.
