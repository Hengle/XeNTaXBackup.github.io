- Post Title: Forza Motorsport 3/4 Engine Sound Files

Hi there,
I was wondering if anyone still has the extracted engine sound files from Forza 3/4, or if someone knows how to extract them? Any help would be hugely appreciated, I am looking to create sound mods for Test Drive Unlimited 2 and the sounds from Forza would be a great start.

Thanks in advance.

I'm looking for the same thing at the moment, I had .ISOs for the game but could never get past the VIDEO_TS and AUDIO_TS

This is easy and has already been solved back in 2012. Just use the towav.exe and drag and drop the .fsb onto it and it spits out all engine sounds with rpms for you.
