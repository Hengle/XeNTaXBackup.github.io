Hi there,

Yes, we will help with this game. Could you please use one of our cutter programs to give us a piece of the archive that we can look at please. You can grab my cutter at [http://www.watto.org/extract/download/cutter.zip](http://www.watto.org/extract/download/cutter.zip) but you will need to have Java installed to run it. Mr Mouse also has a cutter program somewhere that does the same thing. When you use the cutter program, it will make a *.zip file that you can email to us.

Thanks mate.

Um yeah I had a look at this game a while back but I don't think I found anything useful  - I will take a look at it again soon and will tell you if I progress any further.

Yesterday I released a file extractor for the GRP archives used in Codename Outbreak which uses the Vital engine just like Boiling Point so you can try my extractor with your newgrp.grp file to know if it works.
If doesn't work please upload your vital.dll (if this file doesn't exist search for the dll file containing the string gfUnpack).
The tool is available here:
