Also the .PACK files from the soundbank folder? The filenames are also stored in wwiose_project.bin and a .json file.

Hi there,

haven't been here for such a long time (YEARS...)
I'm really interested in extracting the game's music files, since no official soundtrack exists.
I can provide samples of the .pack files inside the common\Wolfenstein.II.The.New.Colossus\base\sound\soundbanks\pc folder.
I barely remember a program in here that let you gather the necessary file information from the beginning, middle and end of the file, so that you don't have to upload hundreds of megabytes. What was the program's name? I'll upload file samples if you tell me the name of it again.
