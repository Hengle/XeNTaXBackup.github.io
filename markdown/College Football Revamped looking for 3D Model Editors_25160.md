- Post Title: College Football Revamped looking for 3D Model Editors

Hi, I'm CBarber3 of College Football Revamped, the NCAA Football 14 mod for PS3, 360, and RPCS3. We are currently looking for someone who can edit and reimport 3D models into the game so that we can further update the mod with stadiums, helmets, player models more current to help make the mod even more up to date and current. Please join our Discord at  [https://discord.gg/u5uFKVDB](https://discord.gg/u5uFKVDB) and message us if you can and know how to export, edit, and reimport 3D models. We can talk more about all the details there on our Discord.
