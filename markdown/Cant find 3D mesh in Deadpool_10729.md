- Post Title: Cant find 3D mesh in Deadpool

I am using Umodel GUI to extract the models from the game but there are no meshes, just textures. In the UMODEL compatibility list it says meshes, animations, textures etc are supported but only texture files are showing up? where are the models?

cmd version works correctly and it extracts all meshes.
umodel -export packagename.xxx
and get the latest version of umodel.

Maybe the package doesn't contain any mesh.

I am using the xbox 360 version, I used xbox360 backup creator and extracted all the files form the disk and I have tried the cmd version and the gui for multiple files but I just get textures.
