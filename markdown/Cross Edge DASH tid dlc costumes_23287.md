Hello, 
can someone help with tid files for Cross Edge Dash dlc (xbox 360 jp only)?

i managed to unpack the .sec files of the base game with this tool:
[http://asmodean.reverse.net/pages/exsec.html](http://asmodean.reverse.net/pages/exsec.html)

the .sec files contain all images in .bmp format

now, there is a dlc costume pack exclusive to the japanese 360 version
the .sec tool also worked for the dlc, but unlike the base game, the .sec file contains .tid files instead of .bmp

i have tried multiple tools from this forum, but nothing worked 

here are is an example:
