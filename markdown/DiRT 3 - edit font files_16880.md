- Post Title: DiRT 3 - edit font files

Hello, I'd like to translate DiRT 3, but some characters of my language missing. I'd like to add them.

I found the .PSSG files. One of them is 3D (mesh font) and the rest 2D (texture font). Can please someone add characters there? OR tell me how to do it?

I have PSSG Editor, but have no idea what to add as there are no textures, just plain 3D models of letters that I can see when I open it in cinema 4d or 3ds max etc... But I have no idea how to convert it back into PSSG.

I'd like to add these characters:

```
Á á Č č Ď ď É é Ě ě Í í Ň ň Ó ó Ř ř Ť ť Ú ú Ů ů Ý ý Ž ž
```


Here is a ZIP file containing all fonts (I can't upload it here, because the ZIP file is by few kbs larger than the maximum allowed size here).
