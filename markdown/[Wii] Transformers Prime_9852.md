Here is the d01.dat file from Transformers Prime. [http://www.sendspace.com/file/jxdm3b](http://www.sendspace.com/file/jxdm3b)

I thought it wouldn't be too hard to get (what I suspect would be brres model files), but having a harder time than I thought.

Although perhaps there's no point, and waiting until the Wii U version comes out would be best (better model quality?)..... but then, learning whatever format the Wii U uses, would also take time.

I don't see any brres or mdl0 headers into it.

Hm, I'm not sure where else they could possibly be:



Unless there's a entirely different model format being used?

Unfortunately there are a lot of the wii games that don't use the brres(mdl0) format. This seems one of those.

Darn... Well perhaps this will just have to wait until someone tries their luck with the Wii U version of the game? I'd love access to the models, but sadly lack the skills.
