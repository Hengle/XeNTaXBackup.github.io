PS3_GAME/USRDIR/FATEGAME/COOKEDPS3/COALESCED_INT.BIN
that file in the all subtitles COALESCED_INT.BIN
you will translate that file.
if you wont take error black screen, you must edit PS3TOC file
download that file.there is in the COALESCED editor and Coalesced repack-unpack program

thank you .. but I need to edit the fonts in the game and add arabic characters to make the translating appear in the game .. and the file that you gave me (Editor) it's only for gears of war not for all .int files
the fonts format in the game is ( .Texture2D ) and there is ( .SwfMovie)
I want to know how to edit them ?

If you want edut texture2... Try hex editor
Texture2d have a open hex footer becuse dds dxt3 and dxt5 is different
This problem just for upk files
Good luck
