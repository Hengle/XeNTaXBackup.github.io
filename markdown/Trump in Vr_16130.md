The demo is made in Unreal Engine, so depending on the version it should quite simple to extract and convert the model.
The tool that you need is umodel, made by gildor. You can find more info about the use on it's site (just google it).

It's UE4, but it's using a VPK format, for example: "pak.vpk", "exe.vpk", "txt.vpk".
Just removing the .vpk does not seem to work, so just a warning.

Can you provide some sample files? My OS is not supported by that installer.
