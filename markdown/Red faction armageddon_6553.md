effects archive has no compression, just a new version of VPP archive. anims is also new version, but has unknown compression scheme (probably the 360 specific XMemDecompress junk).

did you mean xbdecompress? If so it doesn't work so must be something else.

I don't know, I don't follow 360-specific compression schemes, previously zlib was used in RFG, SR2. It isn't the case for RFA.

no one worked out the compression yet? Had a look round the executable and found a bunch of references to zlib but nothing else in terms of compression. Starting to think they may have also been encrypted as none of the file headers share any similarities.
