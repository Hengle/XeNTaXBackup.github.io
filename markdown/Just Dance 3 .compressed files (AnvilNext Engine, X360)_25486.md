- Post Title: Just Dance 3 .compressed files (AnvilNext Engine, X360)

Hello. This game uses AnvilNext engine. There is enough documentation for me to extract a .forge file. Inside is this .compressed file.

I have spent an entire day of researching for any form of tool that can convert it into something
readable and came up with nothing. If someone could help that would be GREATLY appreciated,
