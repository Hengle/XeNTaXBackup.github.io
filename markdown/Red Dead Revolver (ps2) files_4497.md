- Post Title: Red Dead Revolver (ps2) files

I use game extractor from watto to extract files from:

BANKS.DAT
FRONT.DAT
PUPSHOW.DAT
STREAMS.DAT
SWAT.DAT

but i don't know how to open this files. Most of them without any extension. How to open/extract/convert this files?

I need models and textures.

[Here](http://www.sendspace.com/file/sukaj7) some of extracted files from each archive above.
