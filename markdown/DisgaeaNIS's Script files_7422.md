- Post Title: Disgaea/NIS's Script files

[http://dl.dropbox.com/u/32409323/Rips/scripts.7z](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/32409323/Rips/scripts.7z)

I'm wondering if someone would be so kind as to make some type of extractor or convertor for these (mostly the "script.dat" ans scriptXX.dat in D2 DHD) to txt or readable format. I think someone made one before and and it look like lua, but that was another forum.
