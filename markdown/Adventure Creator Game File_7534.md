Hi guys, is there someone who is experienced with AGS resource files? I know there is everything compiled to exe file in CLIB block after end of exe part. But Is there any way how to export/replace data? I need to change resource in version 3.2.0 file. I'm looking for ANY help or info. Thnx

I did, but
1) Gobread doesn't work on my Win7 x64, so it is useless for me
2) There is info that Gobread is not able to extract 3.x exe file, so again, it is useless

You can translate texts in AGS 3.x. I'll explain it soon.
