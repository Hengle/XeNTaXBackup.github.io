- Post Title: Monster Hunter 3D Models Conversion Help

I have a 3D model file of Zinogre that I did find thanks to the work of Rough Chrysalis over on a DeviantArt if anyone can help me convert this into something that uses .obj rather than the other 3D model files in the .rar file in this [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dZH77I ... p=drivesdk](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dZH77IdJ7S2utF23p1eHCh9JVWoz7_Ca/view?usp=drivesdk)
If someone could help me convert that would be awesome.

Edit: It appears that the drive link goes to the selection of the 3 variants of Zinogre, please disregard the Stygian Zinogre and Thunderlord Zinogre files. Please focus on the regular Zinogre please, thank you!

go grab a newer version of Blender and download and install the latest xps plugin for it here:
[https://www.mediafire.com/folder/76g7rvt4ec661/XPS](https://www.mediafire.com/folder/76g7rvt4ec661/XPS)

i tried in Blender 2.79 with XNALaraMesh.1.8.7 and the sample opened fine.

The problem is I don’t have a computer. I only have an iPad. This is not to say I can’t view 3D models on my iPad, for instance I can view files like this [https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/ ... 7SyUPyJJCv](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Unx8Bx6knSP_lxHFWgfAvy7SyUPyJJCv) perfectly fine with no problems whatsoever. But with the Zinogre one the .pmx, the .mesh, or both are not agreeing with how my software is set up.

This works beautifully! All I needed to add were the .png textures and it worked perfectly. Thank you very much! I really appreciate it.

Hey Acewall (or anyone else that is willing to help me out a bit more) could you do the same thing you did to Zinogre but with some or all of these [https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/ ... 9EETdV17lJ](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-0Y3XFuN5khJnwbAeSXHVr9EETdV17lJ) 
I want to cover my bases so that I won’t need to ask for more assistance in the future for future projects of mine.

Notes: 1. The Nargacuga model only has an xps file for the model.
           2. The Tigrex model has several variations, if you decide to do this please only do the regular Tigrex.

Thank you in advance and happy hunting!
