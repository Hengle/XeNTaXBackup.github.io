- Post Title: NHL 10 texture files (Xbox 360)

Hello everybody!

I have been trying to "crack" the texture file format for EA Sports' NHL 10 game on the Xbox 360 for quite some time now, but I don't get anything done. I'm not exactly a programmer/coder and I rarely have had to work with HEX-Editors etc. before. So this is the status quo:

- the files on the DVD can easily be extracted onto a PC's HDD (surprise, surprise...)
- most files are stored in big archives, and by saying big I also mean that they're stored in *.big file-type archives.
- these archives can be opened using BIGEditor and files can also be extracted from these archives.
- these newer files also consist of *.big archives, in which there seem to be four files without a file header

Among these files usually are one texture file, whose header according to HEX-Editors is "RW4xb2" (might be a hint at the file being some sort of compressed RAW-file, like "Raw for Xbox 2" [=360]), a file that weighs in at 1,0 to 1,5 kbytes and two more files at 32 bytes and 288 bytes. I tried changing the texture file (always around 120-150 kbytes big) to some file headers and when changing it to RAW, IrfanView is even able to open it - but it only looks pretty weird.

Here's some screenshots of what the structure etc. looks like:




This is what IrfanView shows, if you rename the files to RAW:


I uploaded one of the big-archives within the big-archives here: [http://www.sendspace.com/file/j4jj4p](http://www.sendspace.com/file/j4jj4p)
It should, if the numbers stayed the same they were back in PC days, be the cyberface texture of player Teemu SelÃ¤nne.

In case you don't want to download BIGEditor for this, here's the files included in the archive: [http://www.sendspace.com/file/g2549s](http://www.sendspace.com/file/g2549s)
"268" seems to be the texture file. All I can say is, that EA used to use *.fsh-graphics back on their PC version and later on switched to some kind of *.dds files.

Any help would be greatly appreciated!

Thanks for your help,

- Ben

I cant shed any light on the texture files but looking at the files numbered 0 and 1, what I see are references to APT.

APT is a format that is used for the user interface of a number of EA RTS games (such as C&C3 and RA3) and (at least in the form used in those RTS games) is loosely based on Macromedia Flash.

The files I see there (0 and 1) are a different format APT file to the ones I have seen though.

Thanks for this reply already, I could see these files being there for facial animation purposes maybe? The players mimic and gesture a lot on the ice, so maybe this could be some kind of "key" to the X/Y/Z positions, where the face's model needs to be moving. Everything we know is valuable, so thanks for already finding that out

Sorry for the double post, but I wanted to provide another texture file so one could probably start to see the schematic with which these textures are created. By looking at a hex-editor, it seems every of these files has "454.000" written at offset 00000010.

Here's the second texture, should be 512*512 and containing a jersey if opened correctly: (texture within the archive)

Bumping the thread a bit. Anybody got any idea on how to handle these texture files? By now we can pretty much only say, that the file seems to be tiled, swizzled and uses a format that seems to be based on DirectDraw-Surface.

Thanks anyways to everyone, who tried to help me out.

I found out one thing a few days ago (haven't been able to do much thanks to University):

- according to an internal text-file within the game archives, the format seems to be somewhat related to .swf flash formats, as they're named like that within some kind of a file list

If anyone could probably help me out somehow, I'd be glad.
