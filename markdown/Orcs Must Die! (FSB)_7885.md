Because the same thing happens. The first track is converted properly but the rest are all static.

EDIT: Out of the 92 FSBs I extract, only 7 of them are fine. The other 85 are all static.

EDIT #2: Worked it out. I managed to successfully extract them with FSBExt and play them with VLC Player.

The FSBs use IMA ADPCM according to FSBExt.
