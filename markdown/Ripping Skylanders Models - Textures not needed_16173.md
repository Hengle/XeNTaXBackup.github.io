- Post Title: Ripping Skylanders Models - Textures not needed

Ok folks, here's the scoop:

My daughters are huge fans of the Skylanders games and will regularly play with the figures outside of the game. My eldest requested that I 3D print some of the villains from the game, since they don't make figures for them.

Here's where I'm at:

I found a tutorial that showed me how to unpack a Wii ISO of Skylanders: Giants. Now I have a bunch of model files in .ARC and .BLD format. I grabbed Quickbms and that's as far as I've got. I've also tried unpacking various Xbox versions of the game but once I get down to .PAK files I'm lost.

What I'd like:

If someone could share a good tutorial for, specifically, ripping models out of the Skylanders games that would be awesome. I'm also happy to start from scratch if someone could walk me through the process. I have original game discs for the Wii, Playstation and 360.

according to google this game was released on these platforms
Wii, PlayStation 3, Nintendo 3DS, Wii U, Xbox 360, Microsoft Windows

i don't know anything about this game but i would say it would be easiest to get resources from the PS3, X360 or PC versions.  

looks like others have been wanting stuff from this game for a while too
