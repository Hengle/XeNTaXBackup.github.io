are you 100% sure that doesn't exist a small index file somewhere?
because the archive starts immediately with the content of the files (a jpeg) and also the last part looks like a file content without an file info table

I'm quite sure, but I made you screenshots of the game's folders.
There's only the main folder and one sub-folder called "data", which only contains some jpegs in different resolutions.

I don't know what files could be index files in there.

I got the stuff.
JaederNaub was able to extract the it. Lots of jpegs, lots of pngs and some ogg files.
