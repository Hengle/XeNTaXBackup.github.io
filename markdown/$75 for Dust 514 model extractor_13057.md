- Post Title: $75 for Dust 514 model extractor

Dust514 is an f2p UE3 PS3 shooter. I have posted about it in the past.

and I also enquired on Gildor's site

```


but to no avail.

However I do know that it is possible. Some random guy from Ukraine was able to rip the models.

I offered him the same amount of money, he sent me a sample model with textures, norm & spec maps that confirmed the files were real, I was all set up to pay him... and then he disappeared. I'm too frustrated to let this go so I'm offering $25 for the character models, $25 for the weapons, and $25 for the vehicles in OBJ format.

The game is free for anyone to download:

The previous guy mentioned that vehicle and weapon meshes came out all twisted using the tool he made for the characters. Don't know if it helps but the file names for the Minmatar M-I dropsuit character were MI_L_D.dds (albedo), MI_L_E.dds (emissive), MI_L_N.dds (normal), MI_L_S.dds (texture mask), and MI_L_SPEC.dds (specular).
