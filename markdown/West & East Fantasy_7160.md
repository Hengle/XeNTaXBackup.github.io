I'm not sure where to put this so I figured I'll put it here.
I'm looking for this client or its files. Anyone have a copy?

[http://we.goorm.com/index.html](http://we.goorm.com/index.html)

Only people with a korean SSN can register for the site (or...I guess also people that have their "ways" of obtaining such information aka fraud, theft), and unlike the other games hosted on goorm I can't find a link to the exe in the page source.

ya, didn't seem to do much.
Actually, I haven't tried viewing source after installing that thing. I don't remember how I got their other client (aside from viewing source and searching for exe, but I couldn't reproduce it again recently).

that may be the missing piece I overlooked.

Were you able to download any of them successfully?

thanks iaw.

lol I went to the site and tried the links but they were the links that didn't work before.
In general I'm supposed to take the stuff after "[http://weonline.krweb.nefficient.co.kr](http://weonline.krweb.nefficient.co.kr)" and just replace it with "[http://weonline.download.xcdnplus.co.kr](http://weonline.download.xcdnplus.co.kr)"?

For anyone interested, it uses the same archive format as Trinity Online except the KCS files are called "KRG_PackFile_xxx" instead of "Trinity_PackFile_xxx"

[viewtopic.php?f=10&t=7071](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=7071)

The models are NIF format 20.3.0.9, and should be supported by nifskope.
