Need some help with these dx10 textures of mafia 3.

this is [the texture](http://www.mediafire.com/file/jv2pv9yxz8o6vb3/00000005.dds)
and here's [how it should look](https://www.mediafire.com/convkey/f1d8/qvqvjiwpfozzblx6g.jpg)

I never got this result and don't know how to proper convert it though some of dx10 textures opens normaly with photoshop.

did  you add the DDS header yourself, or did it come in the game that way?

Studying the file provided, there's no way that's the same texture. If it's supposed to be, then something is corrupted.

ok, well I used that BMS script to unpack the *.sds you provided, and I got completely different results than you did. 



you can see the file sizes for 2 and 5 are different. I can only guess either you have an older version of the script (latest is 0.21), or maybe and older version of QuickBMS.  I used version 0.7.7

this smaller 5.dds appears correctly.

case closed.
