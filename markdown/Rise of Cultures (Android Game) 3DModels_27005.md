Can anybody help me to open and convert these models?

I managed to unzip the apk and to extract the unity .bundle to get these assets but now I'm lost.

I guess it's rather simple so maybe someone can point the way...

Found it.

I could extract the bundle and export the models with "AssetStudio.net6.v0.16.47".
