- Post Title: Oddworld: Munchs Oddysee Animations Ripping (Please help!)

So, I can get the Models, textures, etc from the game, but I can't for the life of me get the animation files open.. Help?  They are .kf files, and nifskope is too new, and can't read a file as old as .kf. Atleast, these ones. I will post screenshots soon, have to resize them
