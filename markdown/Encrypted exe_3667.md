- Post Title: Encrypted exe

Hi!

Just wanted to ask if some of you have anny knowledge about encrypted exe files. I have a exe file from TERA online and it seems it has a themida protection but I have tried some decryptors but none works. Would someone mind if I share the exe? I guess that maybe it would be easier to crack it open at runtime but the whole game installation files are around 5-6gb

Forget about Themida, it's way too heavy for beginners.
You may get tutorials and stuff from SnD's site and forum: [http://www.tuts4you.com/](http://www.tuts4you.com/)
But as I said only information, no crack requests are allowed there.

Sharing the .exe of a MMO (while in terms of 'moral laws' is somewhat iffy) doesn't represent illicit activity since/as long as:

a) Everyone can get access to the game (EI: Download game, acquire Exe.)
b) You're not getting a unique ID game (EI: Steam account tied, specific code for online play, etc...)
c) No malicious function is inserted (EI: Phiser for Account, Hacks, etc...)

I have been able to decrypt 2 exe files before that was aspack protected. Guess themida is harder. I wonder what to do next?

AsPack only compresses the exe, AsProtect also encrypts n stuff. But the new SKE version is heavier, uses a VM IIRC.
