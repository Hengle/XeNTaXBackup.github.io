- Post Title: Any Czech speakers around?

Could anyone who is fluent in the Czech language translate the following phrase into English:

> Vyvojovy tym AGDS varuje: Hackerovani skodi obchodu!
By means of an online dictionary I came up with something like "AGDS development team warns: Hackers (Hacking?) hurts business!", which probably covers the intended meaning, but I'd like an actual correct translation.

Sounds a bit like the warning labels on cigarette packs. 

(The source, by the way, is [here](http://wiki.xentax.com/index.php/Nibiru_GRP#Notes_and_Comments).)

I think It can be translated (but IÂ´m not sure(: "AGDS development team warns: Hacking do harm to business"
