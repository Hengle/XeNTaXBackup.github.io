Yes, dunno if anyone would care, but there have been requests for PS/PSP/XBOX file formats, so I guess there will be people out there with consoles. 

I'm a proud owner of the Nintendo Wii and DS.  

I used to own a Playstation 2 and Gameboy, but I just couldn't be attracted to those, so I sold them . 

Anyway, the line up for the Wii seems to brighten a little (no big titles since its launch), looking at the E3 stuff they showed. Super Mario Galaxy and the new Metroid in particular. 

Two gadgets are also geekishly cool: the Wii Fit board is an obvious winner to grab hold of the casual gamer and the non-gamers, but this is supergeekishly awesome:



Look how the Wii Remote and Nunchunk are clicked in the zapper. That looks like a very good way to start playing FPS on a console, Operation Wolf style! Let's face it, FPSes suck on the consoles, because of the lame control methods. Pit any experienced PC players against experienced console players and the PC players shoot the crap out of the consolers.

Duuuude! WTF is up with that controller?! Damn, I want a Wii so bad!

BTW, all I have is... well, nothing really. I have sometime access to PCs, and I "sort-of" have an N64, but it's over at a friend's house. I *could* also play on a Gamecube, but I think the motor's dying in it, and you have to spend more time trying to get it to read the disc than you actually end up spending playing it. *cries*

According to the article, it'll be available for download onto the Wii via the Wii Shop Channel, but will also be available for the PS2, PSP, and DS.

People - young people - think crap of it, they haven't seen the original. Me, I picture myself sitting in the bedroom of my cousin who owned a c64 and playing this fantastic new game, that had digitized voice and extremely addictive gameplay! My cousin completed the game a few weeks later !

Honestly I wouldn't sell my PS2 for the world. But thats because I'm waiting for Persona 3. I'm a Megami Tensei geek myself. XD
