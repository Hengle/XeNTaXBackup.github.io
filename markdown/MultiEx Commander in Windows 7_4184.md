Just run the Troublshoot Compatibility by right-clicking on the MultiEx Commander icon in Windows 7. Then select XP SP2 after it is done and save its settings for next time. It worked for me on a clean install.

After starting MultiEx Commander in compatibility mode, you can change the settings back to normal again.

True, and no need to do anything but admin run in Windows 8.
