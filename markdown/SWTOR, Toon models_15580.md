- Post Title: SWTOR, Toon models

hey guys!

I have seen a few threads on getting models from SWTOR but i have yet to see any discussion on how to pull a 3D model of your toon (player character), any thoughts on this ? 

I was contemplating importing screenshots into 123D Catch and going that route to capture my toon, but i was hoping there might be a better (higher detailed) way.


F.Y.I my end goal is to make a paint-able 3D print of my main toon for my desk.

i mean you could always go through the files and find everything and align it all one piece at a time, or any ripper that works off the scene in game may work.
