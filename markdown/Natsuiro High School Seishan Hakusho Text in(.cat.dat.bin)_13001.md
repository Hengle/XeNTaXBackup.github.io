Thanks and dawn...

Oh, i remember one thing! You can use Simple Text Splitter to split txt script in pices and upload them (if it helps)
And here mail script, can you help with it? 
[http://www.mediafire.com/download/tv03i ... t/mail.cat](http://www.mediafire.com/download/tv03icvviu2qubt/mail.cat)

Better send it to me on mail [ever17@list.ru](mailto:ever17@list.ru) and not upload it here.
Or code for unpacker to compiler it (with C++? or Python?), or program for it
And thanks again for help!

Not bad, you translated clothes and text in options (i still don't touch it)
Many stuff that you done looks similar to mine)
I already done translation of buttons and other image stuff
Well, would like to see you patch in future too =) 
Better have many options than none)

I want to ask you how you managed with hex editing insert eng text in game... 
Because when i try it game not booting anymore (i don't try change text other than game story scripts, but still maybe you done it other way than me...) :\
And what hex editor do you use?
