- Post Title: S-Tuner Car Builder .3DM and .CON

Hi there,

Some amazing-quality models on this website with infinite numbers of customization for multiple cars (all that would need to be done is abit of texturing but that would be minor at the very least).

If needs be, take alook yourself or at this screenshot: [http://www.stuner.net/](http://www.stuner.net/)

Scroll below images for info!







Somewhat recently they released an option to Export your car to be loaded into that editor another time, with a warning about it being buggy. Anyway, the file type is a .3dt (archive) which contains the following:



a .3DM file is commonly associated with the Rhino3D program but the .con and the .mtl contain all kinds of co-ordinates and sizes for all the parts/etc, therfore something different is going to have to be done (perhaps). the .JPG is just a screenshot of the model when it was exported, no textures inside of it.

The game uses the Away3D engine, if that's any consolation.

.3DT Export example file:

Thanks for reading.

Good news, the .3dm file is just an .obj file encoded with base64. You can use aluigi's bde64 tool to extract it.
