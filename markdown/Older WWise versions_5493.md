- Post Title: Older WWise versions

There are only new versions (2010) of WWise published on its official website.
I'd appreciate if someone could share WWise v2009.1 or older. Seems like Audiokinetic made changes in their vorbis format in the recent versions so it's not possible to create vorbis file a game can read properly (and ww2ogg couldn't convert those files saying "bad vorb size" when original game sounds were easily converted).
I'd be thankful to anyone who can help.

I'd be happy to look at the unsupported files in order to add support to ww2ogg.  Check that you're using the latest version first, I did add support for a different vorb chunk size just recently.
Also I have the installer for 2009.3 if that'll help?

I hope, it will. Can you upload it somewhere? Thanks a lot.
