Anyone looked at Black Ops cold war files .XSUB. XPACK?

I also cant seem to find the .SAB audio archives in there as well so maybe they changed he format?

Came here to ask this but I see someone beat me to it. I dont think greyhound works with the newer Cods? I may be wrong but I think from 2019 onwards they changed it or something but it seems BOCW changed the formats again. Would like to bump this thread as well.

Because it doesn't seem so, in fact the only way i can access audio files of the game is by clicking on "load game" while the game is running, and even doing so, all i get is thousands of randomly named files, is there a way to sort them out?
Thanks!
