Great to see the thread and tools back.

For FFX is it possible to extract all UV maps ? The map files are missing quite a few

With Oreimo Happy End, does this only do meshes? or does it work with textures too?

Possibly I'm doing something wrong, but this utilites doesn't working for me - programs give an error at startup and closing  I tried to run them at Win 10 (64-bit) and Win 7 (32-bit) and have the same negative result...

so long as its the same format I don't see why not, I can't imagine them changing the compression or the model/texture formats honestly.

The tool works (according to TC in the original thread) with DLC models but an extraction script for the DLC files was never released. I asked numerous times here and on zenhax but never got a response.

how about adding support for Sword Art Online Hollow Realization PHYRE formats? Here's 1 from the PC version. The phyre format is almost similar to FFX/X-2, but doesn't extract anything, or gives me a broken SMD.

The tool looks great, well done, I havent digged much into this but I have a doubt, since the Akiba's trip game for the Vita uses Phyre engine, how hard could it be to addapt this tool to extract/inject textures of it?

I don't know if you're still working on phyre tools anymore or not, but I was wondering if you could look at Genkai Tokki Castle Panzers files. I can't get any of the tools you have out to work, ffx is the closest at least it spits something out but its broken... 

Heres some samples if you dont mind taking a look.

The Godzilla tool doesn't work but Daemon I seen you one time on a forum about the problem
with the models because they had LZS compression. So I would like to know the steps to decompress those files

I have to bring this topic up again because the Onechanbara Z2 tool doesn't work for me (System: Win7 64bit). When i drop any of the .cat files on the tool, it immediately crashes with the message "LZS Inpack has stopped working". That's odd because it seems to work just fine for other people. Do i need any Frameworks or other extra stuff installed?

Is there any chance you might be willing to release the source code for the FFX extraction program? Looking to try to see if there's any way to fix the UV map issues and perhaps match up the texture .phyre files. Also, do we know if the FFX modelsl have vertex colors?

No worries, in that case is there any possibility you’ll be able to look into the UV map issue on FFX maps? It seems certain objects are exported without any UV mappings.

Absolutely, attached is the bsil00 phyre file, there are several meshes that have UV mapping issues, specifically-

-The Outer cloth mesh of the tent doesn't seem to use correct UV mappings for its texture as the texture never quite lays right on it.
-The inner cloth mesh doesn't appear to have any UV mappings at all
-The leaves/grass on the island seem to have two meshes. One has proper UVs while the other has none. Not quite sure why they export like that.
-The boats on the sand have a similar UV issue to the outer tent cloth where no textures quite fit on it correctly.

[https://drive.google.com/open?id=17deVP ... 2Wgl_Xuvdd](https://drive.google.com/open?id=17deVPxbec_LBI2fmtW8VQB2Wgl_Xuvdd)

I've noticed that people have said that some maps export with almost no UVs but I haven't quite had the chance to go applying textures to everything yet as the model exported by the FFX utility doesn't export/match up textures to the materials. Been using the Noesis utility and my best visual matching skills to try to get that going. xD

This is because current tool is only exporting 1 UV pair, and map objects surely use many.
I will fix that, but not now. Now i'm working on getting custom characters from FFXIV

I've notice something funny about FFX textures, at least the PC version: some come out without alpha channels, when, they're clearly have alpha.
This happen even using NinjaRipper. Kind weird if you ask me, but, maybe the game has it own way to render them


About the .phyre, from the day it got on PC, I've always dream they could be a way to reverse the conversion. But, its clearly impossible (I guess, just a nOOb though).

hi daemon1, could you update 'superhc.exe' or support newer phyre?

AKIBA'S TRIP 2's phyre could be exported mesh and bones, vertex weights with superhc.exe.It worked almost perfectly.
However, the UV was lost from the mesh that should have multiple UVs.

- Post Title: Re: Phyre engine (Godzilla, Super Heroine Ch., Onechanbara, FFX)

Hi, the tool works on FFX, but it seems that the UV maps are lost in the process.

I tried assigning a texture to some of the model parts on Tidus's model, but the textures are not where they should be.
Here's an example :


Any ideas on how to fix this ? Is it a known issue ?

EDIT : Nevermind I figured it out, the UV maps were simply flipped upside down and side to side. I just rotated the UV map 180 degrees and set the X scale to -1 and now everything's fine.

The tool for Oreimo Happy End isn't included in the download.

Yeah, any of the PS3 ones work. Thanks for still being active and giving out support!

Hi daemon

Is support for Journey feasible?
I tried the existing tools on its D3D11x64 RYHPT 4611 models, but they did not export anything.

Is it a game using the PhyreEngine? I don't know that acronym
These tools are all for PS3 PhyreEngine games,  not PC games.

From what I can see it is using PhyreEngine.
The PS3 version uses PSSG, for which I have not been able to find a compatible model tool.

Can you extract animations with this tool? I'd like to rip the animations from the Godzilla game if-possible

Hey guys quick question : I am trying to convert the dae.phyre from hajime No Ippo : The Fighting.
Do you know wich exe I have to use for that convertion back to .dae (if there is any existing) I found the texture script for Noesis but all the .exe here doesn't look like they work for that specific PS3 game.

Kind regards!

It's pretty simple to get the models. Go to USRDIR -> Data -> GCM -> Characters which has a folder for each of the characters in the game. Go to the models subfolder and run kiseki2.exe on them, you'll get a useable .smd which you can open in Blender by downloading the Source modelling plugin that opens smd's. This won't work with the animation files though which are also .dae.phyre... hope someone can figure out how to get the animations working on the models (which have useable skeletons)....

Hey dear! Cool I had not tested all the .exe files provided in the first post of the forum, my bad!
Kiseki works fine.
I am myself an animator so I just need the characters and I will make some boxing animation.
Is there a .exe file to extract the .dds.phyre textures or just the Noesis plugin?

I would love to know how to code such an exe file congratulation at the people who worked on it. It is impressive.

Hello, everyone! How are you?
I'm new here on the forum and I'm researching ways to create mods for FFX (I'm a animator and 3d artist). 
Is it possible to reverse the extraction process? Convert the mesh file back to .dae.phyre?
