- Post Title: Castlevania Symphony of the Night Saturn and PSX Audio Rip

I've been trying to extract some songs from these games, but no success

The audio files for both versions are in the SD folder, you can mount the CDs with daemon tools or similar, if someone knows how to convert them to wav or flac i'll upload them here

Saturn version uses .PCM format but when trying to play them back using audacity they have a huge amount of noise, are sped up and the pitch is very high

PSX version has 2 files, a 43 MB file "CD1.DA" and a 416 MB file "XA_STR1" with no extension

I tried renaming the pcm extension to adpcm and using a foobar plugin to play but no luck, it's just static noise.

When I had to solave the same issue, I have just decided to download this version [https://romsmania.com/bios/psx-playstat ... 1001-bin-1](https://romsmania.com/bios/psx-playstation-bios-scph1001-bin-1) cuz this is much more stable and time-tested one. But your varient is also an interesting for me. Try to download and check, I think this should completely fix all the problems that you have. Successes to you in this.
