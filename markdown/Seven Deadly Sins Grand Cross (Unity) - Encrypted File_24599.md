- Post Title: Seven Deadly Sins Grand Cross (Unity) - Encrypted File?

I have this file (Probably its header is UnityFS because all files have UnityFS header except this one). Would you help me to know what causes the problem and how to solve it?. Thanks.

Their assets aren't the problem, they have a duplicate header, if you eliminate it solves the problem but this file is different
