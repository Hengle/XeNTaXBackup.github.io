Owww. Mr. Mouse is on vacation and I don't have access to the system. You'll have to wait until he returns (two weeks I think). Really sorry about that.

Well I'm still sorry about that slip-up. I put up a warning on the donation page so others know what's up. I guess you took one for the team. For consolation, I've changed your rank to "VIP member."
