- Post Title: Talesweaver 2 versions to focus on.

I have a private server for J404 and need the English files for the game client TW404J
.exe which does already exists and just need someone who has a copy. All links found up to this point are broken.

Version 808 latest on official Japanese server.
I can do the translation, but the files seem to be encrypted.
Maybe someone can help with finding out how to edit the files?

I have very little reverse engineering experience but a bit of programming experience.
