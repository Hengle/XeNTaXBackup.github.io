Hello! I'm sorry if this has been posted comprehensively somewhere else, but all I'm finding is since then deleted apps and plugins and I'm quite lost. 

Ninjaripper does not seem to work with BDO right now (It must have something to do with the anticheat) 

Is there another way being used these days? I'd very much appreciate a little help! 

Thanks for reading!

Above mentioned post points to another one including a blender 2.49b plugin:

I guess because I'm a little lost and dense! 

A lot of the instructions talk about .pac files, but the ones that I need are .pam files. Noesis doesn't seem able to read them, and I can't seem to find a way to convert them either.

I'll give your blender plugin a try.

Some people don't want to pay a small fee for a GREAT program.
I am a paid owner of your program and I love all your work!

I'm sure it's great, but for me it isn't a small fee. I live in a third world country, my money is devalued af, and I also get charged extra for buying digital software internationally. 
Believe it or not, what is a fee to you, is worth a month of rent in here. Crazy world, innit?

@Meria: what's your progress with the blender plugin?

(Never used it with .pam files, to be honest, because I don't have any samples of static meshes.)

I downloaded the correct version and tried to install the plugin, and it displays as it has installed properly but it doesn't allow me to activate it afterwards (it's not on the list of installed plugins) and thus I can't import files. 

I'm probably doing something wrong, so I'm going to keep trying.

Oh, I'm used to newer versions of blender and installable plugins, lmao.

Could you elaborate further on what the process to get it working is? What I've done so far is...

1. Downloaded blender-2.49b-win64-python26.zip from [https://download.blender.org/release/Blender2.49b/](https://download.blender.org/release/Blender2.49b/)
2. Downloaded the pam plugin. 
3. Extracted the pam plugin. 
4. Opened blender 2.49b. 
5. Tried to load the save in the pam plugin folder. 

And then blender abruptly closes.

UPDATE! 

Okay! I got it working... Ish! I've managed to open the save successfuly and get to the Import window. However, when I select the .pam file I want to import, nothing happens. I'll attach a sample in case you want to test it.

hah, in blender's console window:

Compiled with Python version 2.6.2.
Checking for installed Python... got it!
WARNING:unknown version: 1542

What a bummer.    (supported versions: 1030 and 1286)

Wait, the static mesh format is not that hard (using hex2obj, view ink in my sig):

Woops! Update on that! 

As I continued to extract models I started noticing that more and more were not working properly. I got lucky with the first ones I tried, but most of them give this error: 

It does not allow to preview nor to export.

The plugin works 100% smoothly now!

On the topic of .pam files, has anyone successfuly managed to extract all textures? Most of them on noesis look white and are missing textures even though I extracted every single .dds using the PAZ extractor. In theory, I should have all textures, yet a lot of them are missing. I've tried finding them manually as well, to no result. 

Any ideas?
