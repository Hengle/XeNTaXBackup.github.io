horrible archives because they don't have a fixed format:
- i.dat is the index for the files contained in mcp.bin, cp.bin, ep.bin, vp.bin and tp.bin (raw containers, no headers)
- those that end with the 'p' like sdp.bin have the size after the filename
- all the others (like mt0.bin) have other 2 fields before the size field

what real terrible chaos... anyway I wrote a script for them:

How to re-import modded file to *.bin ?
I tried to QuickBMS's reimport method, but nothing changed.
