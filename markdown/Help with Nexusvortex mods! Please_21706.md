- Post Title: Help with Nexus/vortex mods! Please

So I’ve done what I’m supposed to as far as I know to get mods onto Skyrim but it’s not appearing to work. On the vortex tab, “mods” they’re all there and ready to go, but in the next tab, “plugging” only shows a few mods in. Idk what to do and it’s so frustrating.
