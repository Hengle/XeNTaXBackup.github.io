- Post Title: Exporting Landscape from Fallout New Vegas

I am going to attempt to recreate (or port) a small part of FNV, probably goodsprings, into the cryEngine 3 as a sort of experiment or study. It is for my own personal use, so I will not be uploading anything illegal. That said, I am going to start with the landscape or terrain. The problem is that I cannot find the landscape mesh files. I have a ton of LOD files, but those are not what I want, are they? So, am I just not looking hard enough? Or can the landscape mesh even be exported?

EDIT: i found out that the terrain is generated from a heightmap. i could use the heightmap to generate similar terrain in the cryEngine, but it may not be exactly the same. is there some way to generate the mesh in GECK so i get the exact shape that appears in game? if not, then I would at least need the base mesh which the heightmap uses. as a last resort, i may be able to recreate that base mesh so that my heightmap can be applied properly, but i'm not sure how i would be able to recreate the base mesh without actually having access to it.

so, if anyone can help me out with this....
