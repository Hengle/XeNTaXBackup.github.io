Hi everyone.

I have following two samples from each console, and I cant tell if they are encrypted or compressed, or if they are even possible to be extracted from them, meshes/textures.
Its just a random sample, those of you experienced please have a look and maybe something can be done?
Already where extracted from the RPF archive and they have no names or extensions, just similar header it seems.
Also the extraction key is interchangeable between consoles to dump the RPF.
If necessary I can provide other samples for future research, thank you.

From the biggest file (0xbada2c0c) in your PS3 zip, "offzipped":

The files will require further unpacking after decompression.

I was told to post here instead of a thread i created
I managed to unpack one of the map files from the game but i'm not entirely sure on where to go from there
I think it's a format used in a game made around the same time (i.e GTAIV or Max Payne 3 etc) but I don't know where to start in opening or extracting this file

It seems to be one of those PS3 games, difficult to work with due to compressions and what not, one of the reasons no one ever had a crack at it per say, due to its complexity, was too interested to export the map as in-game, who knows maybe in the future.

Someone has ported the map to GTAV once

you can unpack them with XTD editor for rockstargames(Red dead and so on), it will say RSC files though, those should be the same format, once you unpack them you get the raw information, though, there is little to not much support on specific tools for unpacking, and highly doubt anyone will be taking the legal risk anytime soon

What ya mean with legal risk there? like, the tools needed to use this are like in the line of possible legal use stuff?
