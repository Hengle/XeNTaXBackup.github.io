- Post Title: Little Big Planet (PS3) - RAW audio files

Hello, I have extracted audio files from a game called Little Big Planet and need help converting it to and from any other standard audio file format. I have no clue where to begin doing this however, this is why I have come here to ask.

I have already tried using audacity's import raw function and detect feature, however that didn't result in any recognizable audio. This game uses .fsb audio files for any other audio needs, however I believe these .raw audio files are different because they can only be made by the user when recording them through a mic.

I have attached two test audio files I recorded, they are just some clapping and finger snapping for test purposes and the entire audio should be no more than a couple seconds long.

My goal here is to convert existing audio files, like music, to this file format and try to get it running in the game.

Thanks in advance!

It's hard to recognize audio codec with only clapping and finger slapping sounds.   
Can you record and upload something longer? For example this one minute song from Star Wars

Also, what platform is this file from? PS3 or PSP?

Ok, now I've recorded that song. I've put it in the attachment as well as a recording of it playing in the game, for reference. (that video however was recorded on an emulator so the audio might sound worse than it actually is but it sound almost exactly like it does on a real ps3) The audio can only be recorded over a PSEye camera and the game does some compression of its own as well, so the audio is usually quite distorted.

Also this is on ps3, the audio was recorded on a real ps3 with a genuine PSEye camera. The raw file was extracted from the save using a tool someone in the modding community made. The video I had to make on PC with an emulator, since I have no capture card and PS3 doesn't have any recording built into it.

Thanks for your reply!   

Video recording was too large so here:

Well, I've checked your samples, but I couldn't figure out what codec is used here.
Maybe some additional compression or encryption is applied on those files, I'm not sure.
