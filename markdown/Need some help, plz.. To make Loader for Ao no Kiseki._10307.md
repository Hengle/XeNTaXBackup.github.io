- Post Title: Need some help, plz.. To make Loader for Ao no Kiseki.

I sent mail [http://svinovod2012.livejournal.com/?skip=30](http://svinovod2012.livejournal.com/?skip=30) but no answer to me.

 Anyway, I'm succeed in making translation patch, chinese data to japanese psp data.


But I can't edit system/battle/tutorial text message which is confined in ED_AO.exe files.

And it is protected by Starforce Protection. Can't debug or edit exe file.
How can I make loader for ED_AO.exe..? I want to change system message on ED_AO.exe file.

Download whole setup files => [http://pan.baidu.com/share/link?shareid ... .Setup-3DM](http://pan.baidu.com/share/link?shareid=382400&uk=4213943399#dir/path=%2F3DMGAME-ED_AO.CHS.Setup-3DM)
Everyone can install Ao no Kiseki. But the one who wants to play the game should buy CD-Key.

Download exe file => Download exe file =>[http://www.mediafire.com/?hk2e433nr9q3779](http://www.mediafire.com/?hk2e433nr9q3779)
[!] StarForce 32 Bit v4.50 or higher ? [<Unknown>]

Download ed_ao.dll file => [http://www.mediafire.com/?ys15o3j1s8nvryq](http://www.mediafire.com/?ys15o3j1s8nvryq)
[!] StarForce 32 Bit v5.70.043.001 [SF ProActive]
[!] UPX 3.02 compressed !
