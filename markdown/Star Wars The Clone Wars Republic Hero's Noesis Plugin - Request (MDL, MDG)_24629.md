- Post Title: Star Wars The Clone Wars Republic Hero's Noesis Plugin - Request (MDL, MDG)

I have not been able to find a noesis script that can read MDL and MDG files for this game. If there is one, send a link down below if you could kindly please. If there isn't, I'll drop a few samples.

It looks like the same format used here:
[viewtopic.php?t=15853](https://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?t=15853)

But instead of MDL3/MDG3 headers, they use MDL5/MDG5 headers, so the data is organized differently.
Like before, both files are needed, as the .mdg file stores the geometry, and the .mdl file describes it.

Sorry, I can't find any info on MDG5 files.

Would using this tool extract any armatures inside the files?

They may have bones, but the link I posted was for MDG3 models, not MDG5 models.  There is no tool for MDG5 models.

Ah, I see. Thank you for clearing that up.

When a file format is difficult to figure out, the most determined people usually resort to decompiling the game executable. I would guess that's what they did to make their MDG3 tool.  Maybe find someone who likes decompiling games.

Executable = .exe.  It's machine language.  They use a decompiler like IDA Pro to dump it.

It's not for newbies.  If you don't know a thing about assembly language, then you're not going to understand how to use it.  And if you have to ask about it, then it's probably above your skill level.

If you want something free, google for OllyDbg.
