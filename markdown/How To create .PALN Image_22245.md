This is the structure of the files.

```
long64	Sig // "PALNPALN"
long	fileID
short	width
short	height
long	unknown1 // 1
long64	Null
long	unknown2
string	fileName
long	pixelSize
byte	pixelIndices[pixelSize]
long	paletteNum
byte	palette[paletteNum][4]

```

There're still some unknown fields (unknown1, unknown2) which might be significant to the format. It's not possible to produce a PALN file without known how these unclear fields are generated. Buf if you simply want to replace the images there might be a way.
