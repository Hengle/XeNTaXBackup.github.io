- Post Title: PPSSPP Directx9 - Proper ripping tool.

Hi,
Sorry if this isn't the right place to talk about it. (Also sorry for my poor english)

PPSSPP work now with Directx 9 feature. I was just wondering if people can help me to figure out which rip program we must use for this one.

The game I tried with is Toaru Majutsu no Index.

And here are the program I used:
-3D Ripper DX: WORK ! But no T-pose and mesh look flat.
-Gameassasin: Not work (Or don't know how to use it...)
-Ninjaripper: Don't know if this work since I can't import .rip files into blender.

If somebody can tell me how to use gameassasin on PPSSPP, or even if other rip software exist? Thanks

JPCSP has a built-in feature to export a scene to OBJ.

Use NinjaRipper in combination with the emulator. Then use the noesis plugin to import them into Noesis, where you can view them before you convert them to FBX,OBJ or whatever format you're after from there.

It's easy to fix,just work with the model and get right meshes together.
It will be splitted anyway

you could also post the model samples and make a real model converter.
Being on psp it might already be a common format.

NinjaRipper seems to have worked. But I can import .rip files into Noesis (Even with a plugin)

If you know a to easily fix jpcsp issue on blender, tell me how.

This isn't a common format, some people already tried to do this: [viewtopic.php?f=16&t=6456](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=6456)

Thanks all for helping me

I tired Ninja Ripper on 3 different games Star wars battlefront:Elite and Renegade squadron along with killzone liberation and for some reason they only grab some of the models in the background and not the foreground like this

NinjaRipper will grab the planet and the ship and maybe the wall behind these 2 but nothing else not even their textures unless you hit F9 then it gets the textures.
 

And 3d ripper dx doesn't grab everything either like when i tried to capture the inside of the hanger of the acclamator and the surrounding rooms in it they wont capture it either.

As for killzone liberation with NinjaRipper i get part of the map/props and some of the characters but not the character you are playing as same goes for elite squadron it wont capture the character you are playing as either.
