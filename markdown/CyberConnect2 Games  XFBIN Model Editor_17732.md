- Post Title: CyberConnect2 Games | XFBIN Model Editor

Hi everyone. I noticed that nobody over here mentioned this so I decided to go ahead and do it myself.
Some time ago, a well known user inside the Naruto Ultimate Ninja Storm modding community called ZealotTormunds (or just Tormunds) created a Model Editor for Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 4.
I assume that, since it basically opens .xfbin bod models, it can work with most of the games created by CyberConnect2 like the previous Naruto: Ultimate Ninja Storm games, some of the PS3 .Hack games and JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: All Star Battle and Eyes of Heaven that also uses the xfbin file format.

The tool's source is hosted on GitHub, you can check it right here.
Releases are posted right here.
There's some videos on how to use it on Tormunds' Youtube channel.

And that's it. I was wondering if maybe some people over here could help improving it, expanding it and such, that's why I decided to bring the tool over here.
