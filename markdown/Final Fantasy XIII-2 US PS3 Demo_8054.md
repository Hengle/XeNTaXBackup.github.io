I don't know if I'm allowed to post this but [here](http://www.mediafire.com/?iwe447ar74mcsnx) is the song you wanted. I didn't extract it myself just found it online.

EDIT: By the way, you need to rename the one file to white_trial_u.ps3.bin and the other should be named filelist_trial_u.ps3.bin. I tried with the files you uploaded but since I believe they aren't the complete file I got a different error:

"Error: incomplete input file number 0, can't read 4 bytes. Anyway don't worry, it's possible that the BMS script has been written to exit in this way if it's reached the end of the archive so check it or contact its author or verify that all the files have been extracted"

Haha thanks for the link, it sure does look [familiar](http://vgmblog.tehmiker.com/).  Just out of curiosity, where did you find the link for it?  I only posted it on Twitter.

Anyway.. I ripped that from the 360 version.  Still haven't figured out how to extract the PS3 files.  I tried what you suggested and I also got the "incomplete input file number 0" error.

Did you ever figure out how to rip the music? I got the PS3 version of the game now and it would be great to rip the music and movies from the game.

In this case, VGMToolbox is your best friend. Play around with it a bit and extraction should be easy.
