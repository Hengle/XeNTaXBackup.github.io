The problem is this game is on The Dunia Engine. Which has proven super hard to crack and seems rather immune to ninja ripper and the lot. I wish it was easier cause I'd buy the game just to get the revelator out of the game as well as most vehicles. Hell I'd love the vehicles from Far Cry 4 as well but it doesn't seem it's likely to happen.

That said if you own the game and can get into the files posting a sample tends to get a response by these awesome code monkies of this site and might yet yield the model you want. Hope that helps.
