I successfully opened the file. But I couldn't find a means to repackage it.

Thanks.

How did you open it? And what is your issue with packing exactly?
Can you share some samples?

[blog/?p=112](https://forum.xentax.com/blog/?p=112) with this tool, I opened the .rcf file.

[https://zenhax.com/viewtopic.php?f=12&t=8391&hilit=rcf](https://zenhax.com/viewtopic.php?f=12&t=8391&hilit=rcf) >> Scarface P3D Text Tool > also with this tool, I opened the P3D file that came out of the rcf. I can also make txt files P3D again. But

I can't make p3d files rcf again. There's no tool for that. 

Sorry about the bad English.

Ok, how about those tools? Did you try them?

I have also started my own research on RCF files 
a while ago (maybe it will help a little). But it is still in progress

Thanks.

One of the vehicles says no entry was found.

One has a extraction, but no packaging.
