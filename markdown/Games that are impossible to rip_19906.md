Does anyone know of any video games that are (as of late) impossible to rip? I know Titanic: Adventure Out of Time and all the other games by CyberFlix and the DreamFactory engine come to mind.

the only games "impossible" to rip from are games you can't get decrypted executable from. Or gain access to the raw games files
like any newer ps4 games.

I have some other examples, notably Snoopy vs. the Red Baron and Pac Man World Rally. Maybe you could take a look at the .XPC files?: [https://ia801407.us.archive.org/zipview ... 02006).zip](https://ia801407.us.archive.org/zipview.php?zip=/23/items/SnoopyVs.TheRedBaronPC2006/Snoopy%20vs.%20the%20Red%20Baron%20%28PC,%202006%29.zip)

Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory spring to my mind being that assets for the PC version are encapsulated in a StarForce virtual file system iirc. I may be wrong though.
