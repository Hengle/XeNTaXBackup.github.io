- Post Title: Vital Engine 2.0 cached textures (*.dt1,*.dt2)

Hello.

Please help to find method for decompressing Vital Engine 2.0 cached textures. 
Cached textures have specific compression. Algorithm of that compression possible get from dx8render.dll by reverse engineering. I'm more 3d artist than programmer, so I can't found solution by himself.
