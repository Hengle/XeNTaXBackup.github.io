Thanks,Rick!!
But.. I have no idea what to do.
I tried open your files at MS Visual Studio 2010.
but dialoged "cannot open,because different version".
I have no idea what to do.

and I could some model(GMO files) rip with gitMO from *.pac files. but they have no textures...
I want to extract textures. 

Sorry for my poor English.ã€€I hope you'll understand.

YATTA!!
I learned extractable file type from reading Rick's code.
Fortunately,I can found tm2(headed "TIM2") file from pac.

Thanks a million, Rick.

Thanks to Rick's code and thanks to porimac's hint.
I'd never learnt C# but I wanted the models, and I almost made it through.
But they look..sort of..sniffy.. in MS3d.

Hi, porimac, u must be using Metaseq to import .GMO and .tm2.
Did u wrote an importer plugin for Metaseq on ur own?

Hi,szfzafa!

> Did u wrote an importer plugin for Metaseq on ur own?
As Mr.chrrox say,I use Noesis.

> But they look..sort of..sniffy..
It's so hard...
I used this tool to extract *.tm2 files.

[http://www.geocities.jp/noretales/tool.html](http://www.geocities.jp/noretales/tool.html)

..This Tool made by Japanese, myself included.
I hope this isn't too awkward for you.

How To use it,
1. drug and drop .pac file to edamame_aru.exe
2. type TIM2(header word)
3. type tm2(extension name)

look my attachments picture!   

thanks.

I used GitMO for extract GMO files.

Noesis supported GMO,TM2.

Noesis is a beautiful piece of work like that, it simplifies a lot of these matters. It also intrigues me that they use GMO instead of a proprietary format. Lately Atlus has been using NIF and GMO it seems.

I think there might be convenience of the "Subcontract developer".
They were using RMD in the former work,"Persona 3 (PS2)".
