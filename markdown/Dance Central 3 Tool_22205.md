- Post Title: Dance Central 3 Tool

I know, I know. No one wanted it, but there you have it  A tool for loading models from the Xbox 360 game Dance Central 3. Supports geometry/skeleton/skinning/materials. Tested with dancers only. Teeth mesh is positioned wrongly, but I won't bother fixing that.

You can use [GameArchives](https://github.com/maxton/GameArchives) for extracting the ark files.

Tool overview and example exported model



How to use

Load

milo_xbox: Loads models (skinned) in milo_xbox files. Textures are also contained inside these files, and will be applied automatically.
Export

NUX: Exports the model in custom binary format (.nux), intended to be loaded by Noesis. Noesis script for this format : NUX Script
Textures : Exports textures in PNG format.
Note  : Models and textures will be exported into the folder Export.

File structure is a bit confusing. Models are in "gen" folders and should be around 4-5mb.

This is amazing thank you so much!!! I'm surprised no one has done this for any of the games of this franchise. 
Do you know if there is a way to get the animation files for the routines?
