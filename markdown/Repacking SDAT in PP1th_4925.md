- Post Title: Repacking SDAT in PP1th

I want to replace the voices in Puyo Puyo 15th. As a test, I unpacked the sdat file, then repacked with kiwi.ds. I tired it in a emulator (NO$GBA) and everything is out of order, and the music's off. I didn't change anything. So, is it possible that Sega/Sonic team did something weird to the sdat file or do I do a some hexing?

Note: The files I want to replace are swav and swar.
