- Post Title: An animation problem.

First off, I apologize if this was not the right place to post this.
So, today (after wasting almost 6 hours again) I encountered a problem that has been bugging me. Every time the animation changes ( the game client loads the new. ani file for moving/standing/ etc. (Or so I think?!)), the animation scretches for about a second in another direction, after which, it comes back to it's place and continues with the proper animation, until it's pose is changed again. Also, the animation runs smoothly in 3ds max.

This is what I mean: [http://screencast-o-matic.com/watch/c2nn2wnQLX](http://screencast-o-matic.com/watch/c2nn2wnQLX)

Has anyone got any idea why is this happening? Thanks!
