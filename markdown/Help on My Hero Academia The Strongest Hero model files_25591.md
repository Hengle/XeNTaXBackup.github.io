- Post Title: Help on My Hero Academia: The Strongest Hero model files?

Hi! Out of curiosity, was a publicly available way to convert the .axmd model files for MHA:TSH ever discovered? 
I know zATOMIC over on VRChat was able to rip the models and recreate open-world areas of the game with the original meshes in tact, so I believe it's possible. I just cannot figure out how.

I've been trying to sift through the unwrapped files for months now in an attempt to retrieve one model in particular that's unique to the game. I also used Spiritvoid's bms script and have been able to view the .pmx files via Noesis thanks to it, but with little to no luck regarding the .axmd files. I'm attempting just to retrieve the mesh files so I can import them into Blender as either .fbx or at least .obj.
