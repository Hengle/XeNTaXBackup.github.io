Any information regarding how to Decode the ADPCM streams that
are located in the "STRM" wave blocks of this console are very helpful.

Ive been integrating a prototype ripper that rips out the ADPCM data
from NDS ROMS, but so far no luck in decoding it into
normal PCM streams.

I saw a site that had a conversion tool, let me see if I can get any information.

Edit: So far I have found out a little here: [http://translate.google.com/translate?h ... f%26sa%3DG](http://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&sl=de&u=http://www.portablegaming.de/hardware-nintendo-ds/8436-nds-audioformat.html&sa=X&oi=translate&resnum=9&ct=result&prev=/search%3Fq%3DNintendo-DS%2BAudio-Format%26num%3D50%26hl%3Den%26safe%3Doff%26sa%3DG)

Not much but I'm still looking. I know I saw some audio tools somewhere that converted to and from. Hm...

I was able to get an archived version of the wiki dev site mentioned in the thread.

Edit #3: Oi, thats about all I could dig up that doesn't run around like a chicken with it's head cut off.

Edit #4: I've submitted a query to an emulation board. Perhaps sombody can fill in the gaps.

Good news Strobe! I found a program on a Japanese site:

[http://nintendon.s6.xrea.com/](http://nintendon.s6.xrea.com/)

That extracts AND converts Streams and Samples to WAV, and SSEQ2 files to MIDIs. It is the best shot at this time. Hope it helps.

hehehehe, tried it on a GameCube image, and my whole system froze =P

i guess that program was made for NDS images and note GameCube! 

all i know is that GC uses STRM format for audio aswell.

and thanks for all the info!
