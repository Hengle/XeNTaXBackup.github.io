- Post Title: Dark Souls III 3d mesh issues

Hi I need some 3D models of dark souls 3, but using the Binder Tools 0.4.3 found in this forum and the Noesis 4.2 software with plugin for importing .flver files I found a problem that even reading the various topics on this forum does not I think I understood how to solve it. Can anyone explain clearly and without words how to solve it? I am not very keen on the subject and if you will help me I will be forever grateful.

I also don't have 3D studio max and I would like to know if there are ways to make it work on Blender or Rhinoceros
