- Post Title: The Curse Of Monkey Island

I've been looking for a tool to extract the sprites for this incredible game for a while, but I don't find many things about it

I only find old tools that are not compatible with this specific game, some programs even allow you to view some images but it is not possible to extract anything

like the ones below:

Akos View:


ScummBR Editor
with this open source program I just can't import them, but it is still open source and free for anyone to analyze how it was made


Scumm Revisited
this is one of the best, with a good game support, however,
it is also not possible to extract Actor Costume (AKOS). only rooms or game scripts
