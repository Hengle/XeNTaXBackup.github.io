 Added Hex pattern search Tool

This tool was designed to help users find patterns
in hex values of game files while reverse engineering them.
It can display 4, 2 and 1 byte values converted to ASCII and integers
in multiple files. By changing input parameters user can
modify flow of actions during script execution.
For example user is able to search for 2 byte value, treat is as
little endian in files containing name “texture” and with extension “.res” or “.img”.
Data is viewed at once in one print statement to compare values in many files.
