Hi. I'm trying to rip sound effects from the game Mr. Bean for PC. The sound effects appear to be in WAV format in this version (the PS2 and Wii versions are in SDF format, but WAV is obviously more convenient). They are referenced in GAME.BRA. It contains more than just audio files, but those aren't priority.

It seems that this script is working fine with your sample

Thanks. I didn't think this format was known earlier.
