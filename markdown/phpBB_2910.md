Which version of phpBB does this forum use? Are there any plans to update it?
It seems a bit old and outdated to me, other boards have more features.

It IS old. Dinoguy1000 has also asked me this. I do think we should upgrade to a new version. Problem is phpBB is a bit of a pain in the mod department and code is not always flawless. But you're both right, we should upgrade.

Glad you like it. It's a standard theme though. But a bit tweaked.

Heh, I didn't realize you went ahead with the upgrade. I really need to pay closer attention... Have you gotten the custom BBCodes I requested installed?

Hey, I here 3.0 isn't so safe, and that security flaws have already been found! A client of mine (Hosting), had his hacked a few days ago.

Might want to read up on those : (.
