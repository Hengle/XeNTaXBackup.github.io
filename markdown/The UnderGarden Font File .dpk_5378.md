I've done it manually by offzip and then renaming the extracted and unpacked files (names may be inaccurate, i've just guessed they by .dpk file). It contains 8 DDS textures.

Very good, thanks!
Well, is there any way to pack it back?

There's always a way. But unpacking is much easier than packing. I'm not a programmer nor a BMS script writer so I can't do that. Maybe somebody else could make a packer. 

In that .dpk file is a path to the original .dds files used in building that game. 
Something like C:\AutoBuild\BuildUndergardenWork\Undergarden\PlatformData\Win\Fonts\DDS\Arial_16.dds

I don't if it's somehow related to playable game, but it's possible that game can run with unpacked fonts.

No, game don't work with unpacked fonts.
Thanks, anyway
