- Post Title: Ripping from RWBY Amity Arena APK?

Hey there, I'm trying to rip models from the mobile game RWBY Amity Arena by using Asset Studio to extract the files from the APK when I'm emulating it through Nox. But for some reason, Asset Studio can't view the models themselves, and can only recognize basic Unity files that come with any game made using it.

I have the APK file here, if someone wants to help me figure out how to extract the models and textures.

Hi there, I know that this is an old post but I have just recently extracted the files from RWBY Amity Arena. The thing is, the models, textures etc are not stored in the apk itself. They are downloaded when you run the game and to find them I plugged my phone into my Win10 Machine and they are located at This PC\[name of phone]\Internal shared storage\Android\data\com.nhnent.SKRWBY\files\UnityCache\Shared
