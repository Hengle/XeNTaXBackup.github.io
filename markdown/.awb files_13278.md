- Post Title: .awb files

I'm trying to rip some sound files from a game. After extracting the cpk files I got myself some files in awb format.

I've looked on the internet pointing me to extract the file to several hca files which I can convert to wav. However for some reason I can't extract the awb files.

I've tried the utf_tab07b6_special, however it gave me an error saying cpk signature not found.
I've also tried quickbms, however it gave me a list of dat files. I don't know if I can rename these to hca and continue, but that doesn't sound possible.

So yeah I'm basically at lost of what I should do over here, I've tried every single things suggested on the internet and haven't found a solution yet. So any help would be appreciated.

This is the awb file I mentioned: [https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BxGbIf ... sp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BxGbIfzPkopsMUo4bm1PTEVZOFU/view?usp=sharing)

Can you post the .ACB file as well for that archive?

EDIT: Seems there's something else going here. There's no HCA magic in the header but it still shows the frequency and number of channels in extracted files.
