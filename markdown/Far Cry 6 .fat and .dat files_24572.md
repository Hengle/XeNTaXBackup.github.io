- Post Title: Far Cry 6 .fat and .dat files

Preload has started on PC I managed to get some files beforehand.

FAT version has been changed from 10 to 11, with it fat stuct might have changed as well (Previous unpacker extracts null bytes for compressed files)

It didnt work for me for some reason either but Ekey managed to get it to work on his end. I tried unlocking the DLL ut that didnt work either.

Anyway heres the latest log.

EDIT: Okay i got it working. thx to Ekey, the FC6 log posts in the main game directory and it overwrites each time you run the game. so rename the log to get new versions.

heres now the latest one.

Updated to r2 . Now the log will have the date and time format in the file name to avoid being overwritten

Did some research in some .xbg files, DJ Normality posted them here: [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IVS3Ef ... rwXmy/view](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IVS3EffMi3nFv78FnWSGGlsXGz1rwXmy/view)

Verts appear to be split in some or most files if not all, example file: CABBAB432E7A1932, verts appear to be short signed.

In said file: 0x1130 short sign, 10209, padding 2
In same file: 0x044180 - 5478 - short sign, 2 padding
Probably nothing new for more experienced people like bigchillghost or shakotay or daemon or akderebur so have to wait for someone more experienced like them to figure it out. Faces I could not figure out unfortunately, pretty sure they're byte but couldn't get any of the files to work, verts did however work with short sign but like I said they appear to be split throughout the file.

EDIT: After looking at the file once more I realized at the top there's LOD0 - LOD1 - LOD2 listed, so the split verts etc are most likely just different LODs packed into the same file for performance.

EDIT 2: (thanks DJ Normality)

If you look at file A08F7270CE7E2467 - here you go, faces appear to be short, verts also are XZY format, also this is probably LOD1-2, couldn't get faces for LOD0



If you also change the vert offset to 0x8b00 it's the exact same verts count but faces don't match, possibly because different LOD?, unsure what this means.

Now when it comes to bones, weights etc I can't help since I don't have that knowledge or when it comes to automating etc. Materials appear to be at the very top/start of the file too.

EDIT 3: Also found multiple split parts, if you open the biggest file in the link above it's a helicopter and I was able to find that the interior and exterior were separate so keep this in mind also.

I have this, somewhat unusual question and if I posted it in the wrong thread then I apologize. I am looking for the location in the game world of several documents, the so-called Hidden Histories. Do you have any hints where (which unpacked files) I should look for their "coordinates" in the game world? If there are some coordinates that I can compare with the coordinates of others that I know where to find, then maybe I will figure the approximate location of the ones I'm looking for
