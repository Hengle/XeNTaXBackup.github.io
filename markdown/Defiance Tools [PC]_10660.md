- Post Title: Defiance Tools [PC]

I'm going to start using this thread for all the release updates instead of spamming the board with every release

These are a set of command-line tools for extracting textures, static meshes, skinned meshes, and other tasks with the PC version of Defiance by Trion Worlds. 

More details can be found in the [README.md](https://github.com/zeiban/defiance-tools/blob/master/README.md) 

If anyone has access to a 360 or PS3 ISO and would be interested in knowing if the tools work with them. I've been asked but I don't have access to any console version.
