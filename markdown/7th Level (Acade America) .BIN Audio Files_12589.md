- Post Title: 7th Level (Acade America) .BIN Audio Files

Hello everybody,

I extracted some [audio files](http://noneatme.de/download/sounds.7z) from the Acade America 7th BIN files.

These sounds are very very old. (around 1995), I think [this might be the right source.](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/ff538799%28v=vs.85%29.aspx)
There is no audio header so I can't find the right audio format / codec.

Any help would be appreciated.

Greetings
