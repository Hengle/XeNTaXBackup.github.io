- Post Title: XBR, P3R and BPB formats of files

Hello guys, we really need your help!

We are the modders of the game, called Cars: Mater-National Championship.

We have the mod, named Superdrive (Hi-Octane earlier), and here we have a XBR, P3R and bpb files formats, and we can't extract them.

We didn't find anything about these formats, and as we understand - it is custom file formats. 

We need some programmers to help us. Please, write down in the comments if you want to help us. If you can make the extractor - please, write down in the comments too, and give us your Discord name or other contact information, so we can contact you and talk about it.   

Thank you for your attention guys! We are sorry for our grammar mistakes!
