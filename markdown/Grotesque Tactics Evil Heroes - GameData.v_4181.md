its just a pk zip file xored with 0x55
use this command
the xor program is not mine
xor.exe F:\Grotesque-Tactics\GameData.v F:\Grotesque-Tactics\GameData.zip 0x55

the vmesh model format is very easy to read if you need help with it let me know.

Hi, chrrox. Can you finish this project someday? I need models with bones and weight data.

Same file format is in Trapped Dead.

3DObject Converter can open the .model files but no luck with the vmesh files (props/buildings, etc..) 

Would love to have this max tool you showed the pix from for that game.
