Is it possible to extract the models and textures from this game? If so, please let me know how. I believe it uses the Dawn engine and the files are pc_resourcelib files.

Oh, don't be rediculous, all they're demanding is to know whether it's possible.

Wait, what? It isn't?  
My point is that it should be a common sense for those who seek help. I'm sorry if you failed to see the sarcasm in that comment.

I assume it's gonna take a while to get tools for this game.

Just wanted to say that the tool that was linked, made by RandomTBush, is for Guardians of the Galaxy: The Telltale Series, which is a game that came out in 2017. It will not work on the new Guardians of the Galaxy game that was recently released, it's a completely different engine and game.

Another thread was opened recently and someone posted samples over [here](https://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=24701), but it unfortunately doesn't look like anyone made any progress yet.

Thank you for clearing that one out. Hope someone can come out with the tool soon.
