Has anyone ripped Starcraft 2 sound effects and voices yet from the beta?  I would be interested in listening to them for fun.  

BTW: I know the music from the beta has been ripped.

they're just mpq files, download the beta and a starcraft (the original) mpq editor. they haven't really changed the format besides giving it a different extension.
