we can found sample here 

Gildor say 
2. Audio files contains some custom sound object which doesn't exist in UE4. 
I see it contains some binary data inside, so probably there's some wave data inside,
 however it doesn't have any known sound header, so I can't recognize it.

any help is welcome

Soulcalibur VI uses CRI ADX2 audio. The HCA files can be extracted using VGMToolbox from the .uexp files.
