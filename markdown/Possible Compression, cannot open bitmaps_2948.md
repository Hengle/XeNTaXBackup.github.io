- Post Title: Possible Compression, cannot open bitmaps

Hi Guys,

Need some help with some images from Simfarm. Thanks to Rheini and Rick i have managed to extract the files from the archive, but i need help with the images. I dont know if there are using some kind of compression (RLE??) or not.

Any help would be much appreciated. Below is a screenshot of the image when imported into photoshop using the params specified in the header of the file, which is believed to denote the width, height, bit level, and frame. On all files the depth is 4-bit.
