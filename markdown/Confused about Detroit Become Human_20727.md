- Post Title: Confused about Detroit Become Human

I've been seeing DBH models popping up around the net, so I decided to try finding the game files to extract some myself.  So far, though, the only thing I've found is a set of PKG files, which are apparently encrypted against the PS4 firmware (version 5.50), and that there's no way to extract the PKGs because there's no exploit for the firmware (no way to get the encryption key).

The confusing part is, how are people getting models then? EVERYTHING I've read so far states the only way to get the decrypted files is to dump them using a jailbroken PS4, but that isn't possible since the firmware hasn't been hacked past version 5.05.

Where are people getting the files?

Does anyone have a link to the game archives?

How big is the game?  30GB...50GB?  You're not going to find torrent links here.

I'd love to port some models as well if anyone still has the link. 

Cheers
