Deronar extracted many models,but seems like he never share those models in public

I tried to learn how to find face indices end address,but I can't understand it at all
Can you tell me what's the end addressï¼Ÿ

You don't need to know the endaddresses. Just try a face index count of 500 then increase this value.
There's some trial 'n error required until the max index count in the lower left list box gives a useful value.

Or use this:

But rename your model file to arcadia.mdl for example because hex2obj will crash without a dot in the filename. (just another ugly ptr bug  )

btw: nice babe with a realistic real life face.

Out of curiosity, how would one deal with multiple UVs the mesh seems to have. The body and hair bits UVs seem to come out fine (albeit flipped) but the face one seems to be completely borked. 

I've been able to get a sort of salveagable one if I set it to WordUV. Though I'm working out what all the entries on hex2obj are

Yeah looks like face and eyebrows. But like I've said - if I set it to wordUV I do get more or less something that remotely looks like a face UV in one of the corners. Albeit quite stretched.

There is no clipping with WordUVs (but nethertheless the uv format should be half floats).

Thank you for the feed back!

Yeah this looks correct 

In the meantime I'll go back to the tutorial to try and understand what I'm looking at
