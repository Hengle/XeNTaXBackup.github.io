Does anyone know to do tire tracks for the mvau editor? I have photoshop and PSP7 (Paint shop pro 7)

What is "mvau editor"? 

Can you upload some texture samples?

The Mx vs. ATV Unleashed editor that comes with the Steam version of the game, I'm wondering how this is done. Those tire or dirt tracks on the landings? It's probably done through a photo editor just how is what I'm trying to figure out. It confuses me how this is done, I'm trying to get something like those tire textures on my tracks.

The tire track generator that comes with the editor is not the best, especially if you bump up the tire track count, looks really crappy. I don't think there is a way to replace the stock tire track textures they give you, from what I've been looking at in the game files.
