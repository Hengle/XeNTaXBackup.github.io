Salutations,

I have recently tried to look upon this game, with some tools like GLIntercept and GLXtractor, since it runs on OpenGL, but it didn't work.
I looked upon the files, and found PNG headers, so I tried to isolate them, but failed. I'm not good at coding.

If anyone wants to look at it, here's a file:[https://mega.nz/#!MOpExaDC!ug_BEHVJRrxS ... 0e0X4-V5yC](https://mega.nz/#!MOpExaDC!ug_BEHVJRrxSCZTpcGUhpSpecWxaTlbE0e0X4-V5yC)

you can rip pngs and wavs from your sample with "Game Extractor".

Ah, alright. Do I need a specific plugin, script, or action? Since I have tried all scipts and plugins separately.

no all is included in the download link, you just launch it and open the sample.

Opened the exe and just selected the file. Am I missing something?

all i do is launch the program and double click the sample in the browser window
on right and then it shows a list of files in middle window that can be extracted.
its not a plugin but format scanner to find known types from the sample.

edit
looks like the scanner doesn't work with the "Basic Version", bummer.   i use the full Version.

let me see if we can find another scanning tool, maybe Dragon Unpacker or something works.
yep it works too using HyperRipper in Dragon Unpacker.
