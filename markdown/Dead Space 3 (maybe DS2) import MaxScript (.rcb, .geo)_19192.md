Hi guys! Here's maxscript to import [PC] Dead Space 3 (maybe DS2 too) character's/monster's models with bones and weights (3ds max 2009-2016). 



P.S. Used picture provided by Tosyk, thank you very much!

Don't know if you don't have time, but is there any way you could add batch support for the mesh files?

Is it possible someone could make that into a batch version? Much appreciated
