I use the DDS plugin for Adobe Photoshop.

I'm checking into that now.  I'm reinstalling Photoshop 7.0 and have already obtained the plugin.  My only problem now is, once i compile the new skins for Unreal 2, are they going to work.  Are the DDS files that Unreal 2 uses compatible with the PS plugin...
I'm soon to find out and i'll let you know what becomes of it.
I appreciate your help Mr. Mouse.  I've been searching for a way to do this since midnight last night and i'm dying to get things working and get an hour or two of snooze time.

One way to make sure you have the right format (I think) is to open a DDS file from Unreal 2 and examine its properties. So that, when you save, you can make sure you set the right properties. Also, perhaps its possible to simply edit a DDS file from Unreal 2 straight away and save it when you're done.

Not quite so easy.
For some reason you can not open pre-existing dds files with photoshop and the plugin.  You can however make new files and save them as dds.  I did this and was one step ahead of you on checking the files info so as to save the file as close to the original form as possible.  I am not so sure tho, that i have all the information that is needed.  I am using a quite simple program called Irfanview to look at the DDS files and as for the inforamtion it gives on the dds files, well, its quite 'lacking' if you will.
anyways, i went so far as to create a new dds file and save it.  when viewed in Irfanview, the entire picture doesnt come up, like half of it didnt get saved.  Also, when i go into the game after replacing the original dds file, the player skin still looks the same, even tho i changed it (Aida should have breasts now - work for game-de.de) and also, from what Irfanview showed, half of it wasnt even there.  So, how the hell is the original skin there !?
Mr. Mouse, if you have an instant messanger i could speak with you in real time on, please let me know.
email me at [tripp_head@hotmail.com](mailto:tripp_head@hotmail.com)  if you dont want to give out said info on here.

weeeeeeee
so, i've gone so far now as to make post in atari:unreal 2 forums, sking how to edit skins.  i find that unrealed comes with unreal 2 and supposedly can be used for skins editing(i guess) yet i have yet to see ANYTHING pertaining to it in ANY tutorials, forums, etc....
guess i'll wait to see what people say in the next few days in the forums.
for some reason i get the feeling i'm going to have to go about this in a not so easy manner.

grrrr, nevermind.  not even the people in the skinning section of the Unreal 2 forums know how.  No one who uses the UnrealEd mapping tool know how.  No one even has a topic close to what i'm trying to do.  Some guy wanted to import an UT2003 skin, but thats about it, and all he was told was "it's not possible"
*kicks the ground*
I'm not giving up yet, but i'll stop bugging you guys with posts about it.
