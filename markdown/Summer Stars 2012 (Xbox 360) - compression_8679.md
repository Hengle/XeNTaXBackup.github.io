- Post Title: Summer Stars 2012 (Xbox 360) - compression

I've just written a script to extract the contents of the two pak files from Summer Stars 2012. However, some files within are compressed. I've used comtype_scan2 but it didn't find anything useful, at least not with the desired file size.
I've uploaded the smaller pak file, including the script: [http://www.sendspace.com/file/z0rh2r](http://www.sendspace.com/file/z0rh2r)
If anyone could please take a look at the compression, I'd be glad.
Thanks for your help!

The first 1/2 of the file looks like it is compressed with the new xmem compression not yet supported in quickbms(supported in noesis) the 2nd half of the file looks like a model file no compression.

Ok, the info that it isn't yet supported is sufficient for me.  Thanks.
