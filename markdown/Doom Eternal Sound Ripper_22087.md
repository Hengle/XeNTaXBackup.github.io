- Post Title: Doom Eternal Sound Ripper

Made a Doom Eternal Sound Ripper, it can extract sounds from .snd files preserving their IDs for future renaming, also third-patry converters included to convert from .wem. While restoring original sound names seems not to be possible, renaming using data from bnks (event names etc.) allows to atleast distinguish and group them.

06.07.2020 Update: fixed reading of soundmetadata broken after recent updates.
