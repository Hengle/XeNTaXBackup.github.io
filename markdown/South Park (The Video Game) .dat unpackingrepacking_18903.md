- Post Title: South Park (The Video Game) .dat unpacking/repacking

Hey there! Does anyone know how to repack/unpack south park's audio from spsounds.dat? I wanted to change some audio from the game. I tried various tools but with no luck. 

Here's the .dat file for download: [https://files.fm/u/b3xtdxpg](https://files.fm/u/b3xtdxpg)

edit: After spending couple of hours i managed to find watch dogs file extractor, which seems to kinda-of work with the games dat file which contains text files and audio files., however i still cant find a way to repack the .dat file. So i'm stumped, could anyone help me out?

You're talking about that old South Park game using the Turok engine, right?

I remember digging through the files a while ago. I did manage to open the .dat/.mrg files in my quest to find where the model files were located. 

I used this program to open the files.

I'm pretty sure the file formats are the same as Turok 2.

Yeah.
I tried the tool and it seems to extract the data perfectly! thanks, however it doesnt seem to work with "spsounds.dat" as it extracts only one big wav file. (I used Watch dogs extractor [https://www.moddb.com/games/watch-dogs/ ... -extractor](https://www.moddb.com/games/watch-dogs/downloads/wd-files-extractor) and it seems like it extracted all the audio files. Though it also extracted a lot of text files with it aswell).

Also any idea how to repack it?

Not sure, haven't looked into it. 

I'd try looking for Turok modding tools, since South Park uses the same engine as Turok. (Turok 2 I think?)

Unless they modified the engine itself, any Turok tools should work. I think the game is essentially just Turok with a different skin.
