OpenIV 2.7 - 7 Years Anniversary


Exactly 7 years ago, [Dec/28/2008](http://openiv.com/?p=117), we released the first public beta version of OpenIV. Since then, we have been constantly working on it. Today, we are proud to announce a new version – OpenIV 2.7.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gzLHzd5eto](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gzLHzd5eto)
In the three months, since the last release, we have added many improvements and enhancements.
All new features can be divided into the three major groups:

openFormats development
openFormats support in Grand Ttheft Auto V was significantly extended. We have added support for editing .gxt2 with openFormats for all moddable platforms: PC, Xbox 360 and PS3.
Editing textures (.ydt) and collision models (.ybn and .ybd) is now supported for the PC version.
Last, but not least, openFormats now has new improvements for editing .awc files both for Max Payne 3 and GTA V.

Brand new Package Installer
We are glad to introduce a new version of Package Installer, which supports Grand Theft Auto V.
With a new version of OIV-packages, you can change appearance of Package Installer and display additional information about the author of the mod.
Complete documentation for the OIV formats will be published in the next few days.

Improved support for "mods" folder in Grand Theft Auto V
We have added new notifications and functions, which make using "mods" more convenient. Now, when you install the OpenIV.asi plugin, you will be prompted to create "mods" folder.
If you have both OpenIV.asi plugin and "mods" folder, you can see new options: "Copy to mods folder" and "Show in mods folder".

Bug fixes and minor improvements
In this release, we have also fixed a large amount of bugs and added some minor improvements.
As always, you can find full change log [here](http://openiv.com/bugs/changelog_page.php).

Today, we are happy to announce the new release of OpenIV 2.8. This release focuses on openFormats, Package Installer and user interface improvements. As you can see in the video above, we are finally bringing support for basic GTA V models into openFormats. Soon, you will be able to edit and create YDR and YDD models using 3DS Max.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvqBXlF0Y1c](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvqBXlF0Y1c)

Here are major changes in OpenIV 2.8 release:

openFormats for Grand Theft Auto V
We have added ability to export and import of YDR/ODR and YDD/ODD model files. To work with new formats, you will need new tools, our plugins for 3DS Max will be released soon. However, openFormats still have some limitation with formats, but they will be eliminated in future updates.

Package Installer
Package Installer now have log, so you can easily check, what is going wrong in the installation process. Also, we update OIV Package format to version 2.1, which brings commands for editing XML files and more. Please check new specification [here](http://docs.openiv.com/doku.php?id=packages:version_21).

Administrator mode notification
Starting from this version, OpenIV will show you notification, if you launched OpenIV as Administrator. If you need, OpenIV will help you to set correct permissions for your game folder, so you will no need to run OpenIV as Administrator.

UI Improvements and bug fixes
The user interface has many minor improvements and bug fixes. For example, you will see new commands for global search results.

Excellent update! Being able to work with the game models in max is always such a treat. Unfortunately the latest EVO imports the model's skeleton set orientation at 90 degrees to the right, hope a fix will be available soon.

Try this:

> There's one thing you all should know about ped models import:
>
> Some models haven't got full skeleton in them. To import the skeleton and skinning properly, you should get the full skeleton from corresponding .yft files using OpenIV.
>
> For an example, if you want to import some of player_zero models, you should go to the player_zero archive, click right mouse button on the player_zero.yft file, and select "Export skeleton".
>
> Then, you place that .skel file near to needed .odr or .odd, and change the skeleton file's name.
>
> If the model name's "uppr_000_u.odr", you should name the skeleton "uppr_000_u FULL.skel"(note the space between the model name and "FULL" part).
>
> GIMS will find that skeleton and use it instead of the model skeleton.
