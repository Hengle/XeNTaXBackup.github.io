- Post Title: Billy Hatcher and the Giant Egg .arc files (HELP NEEDED)

Through research on a hex editor, I can see that these .arc files are likely to have object files. Thing is though, I can't find a way to extract them. They are not the same as other SEGA games that have used the .arc format.

HELP WANTED PLEASE

1. Why do you need this. 
2. What about providing an example?

I was planning on extracting texture and model files from the game directly instead of using injected model rippers (for example 3DRipper DX) which output poor results, and maybe even import new textures and models into the game.
Examples of these files include: superbilly.arc
ani_model_owl.arc
lib_model_68.arc

I will not be providing links to these files since they are copyrighted.
