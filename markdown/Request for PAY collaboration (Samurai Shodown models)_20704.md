- Post Title: Request for PAY collaboration (Samurai Shodown models)

Hi everyone.

I do these figures:

To do that i use 3d models from games.

Now i´m trying to make a youtube channel but it´s too much work to do it alone.
SEO, Image record, Video edit, Audio edit, rip models, edit models pose, voxelize, make it on fuse beads... its simply too much...

Now on november it´s gonna be released Samurai Shodown (a game that i love from the arcade game... many many years ago) and i want to make sculptures made of fuse beads.
But i´m tired... too much work.

So i would be glad to PAY for the models in cool poses in fuse beads.
I´m interested in original models posed in cool frames of the game animation. Textures is secondary cause i have to color manualy the model in voxelization process.

And if no one is interested  can anyone showme how can i extract the game animations of the models. Only point me where to start another travel through the desert.

Bye and thanks in advance for any help.
