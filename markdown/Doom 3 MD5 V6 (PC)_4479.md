Guys, I always wanted to bring Alpha Shotgun back, but I tried many times with no luck. now I want to convert MD5 V6 to MD5 V10 correctly. I really need your help. I'm sure that Doom 3 fans will be appreciated.

Here are the Alpha versions of shotgun model & animation:

People are crazy nowdays, bumping 10 year old post.
This is a result of 10 minute search:

I looked on those links already, I tried downloading different plugins to import .md5mesh however the only thing that worked is a model previewer, then again, I cannot export anything with it.. Sorry to bump an ancient thread, I didn't want to create a duplicate of this and figured this would cause less frustration..
