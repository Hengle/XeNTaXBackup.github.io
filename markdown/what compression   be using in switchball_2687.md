Unlikely that VNZ file is compressed. 99% it is not.
however its really too small for me too analyze it properly.
please submit a larger file.

I think it's LZMA [http://www.7-zip.org](http://www.7-zip.org)

Surely, it is not LZMA, and it is not compressed at all.
d_airball.dds can be compressed itself by 70%
