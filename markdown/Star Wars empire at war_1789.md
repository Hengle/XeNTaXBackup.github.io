Looks extremely easy to extract from :X
and Jaeder Naub had no trouble in reading the DDS files that were inside
the cutted archive. it should even read all the rest of the files.

Mr Mouse kindly made a MexCom script for the Empire At War .meg format.

You can find it in [this thread](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?t=1700&start=0).

In the end of that thread are also a couple of links to other EAW extractors...the one you arleady linked to, but some additional ones as well.

Cheers
