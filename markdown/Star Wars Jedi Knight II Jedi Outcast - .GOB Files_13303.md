- Post Title: Star Wars Jedi Knight II Jedi Outcast - *.GOB Files

Hello! I'm looking for a way to extract and recompile this GOB archive from the Gamecube version of Star Wars Jedi Knight 2 Jedi Outcast.

File Samples: [http://www.mediafire.com/download/uxvbw ... +Files.rar](http://www.mediafire.com/download/uxvbwoxazjf5mmg/SWJK2JO+gob+and+gfc+Files.rar)

The GOB file is usually about 113 MB. I included the GFC file just in case it's needed.

Thanks in advance!
