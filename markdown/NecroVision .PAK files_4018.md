- Post Title: NecroVision .PAK files

Hi guys, I need your help to do a translation mod for the game "NecroVision". When I extract a .pak file in the same folder that the original .pak with the same name, the game automaticaly load the files from the folder, example: "lscripts.pak" extracted to folder "lscripts". But when I do the same thing with the file "subtitles.pak" it don't work. The game ignores the folder "subtitles" with all subtitles in .srt format, even if I delete the original "subtitles.pak" file, the game just load the cutscene without subtitles. I need to translate all the game to my language (Brazilian Portuguese) but i'm only able to translate the files in the folder lscripts, because the game just load the files in this folder. I used a tool called "Painfull" from Xentax forum, this tool says that "insert" new files in .pak files that uses the "Pinkiller Engine", but the game (NecroVision) don't load the new .pak file repacked with "Painfull" tool. I don't know any other tool able to build a .pak file compatible with "Necrovision", and the game insists in don't load the extracted folder of "subtitles" files.

Can you help me in something? I really wish translate this great game to may language, and many Brazilian players of this game are waiting for that translation.

Our web site did contains several translations of many games, and we do not support piracy. All content it's legal. Here is the link: [http://www.gamevicio.com.br](http://www.gamevicio.com.br)

Thanx for your time and support, I'll be waiting for a response! Have a good day!

PS1: The Necrovision .pak files can't be open with winrar or winzip, but only with Dragon Unpacker or Painfull!
PS2: Like I said, I'm a Brazilian guy, so, sorry for my poor english...

To extract use Dragon UnPACKer 5.
