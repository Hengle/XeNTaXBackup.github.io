Hi,my name's Joseph.I would like to discuss on WWE RAW Modding.I'm from a forum named The Wreck Room.This community has been modding WWE RAW for PC For over 10 years now.We achieved success modding this game.Members there have made great discoveries including myself.We were unable to crack the character model file .fml and the animation file .fmo.
I'm here to request  for .fml character model file support for Noesis model tool.I request the developer of Noesis to add the model file support in his tool.His effort will be much appreciated.
The model uses textures in DDS Format.I'm attaching sample textures and models.Each character has three model files H,L and M.a and b model files are for the items the character wears on his body.I'm attaching sample model files and textures.
More info on the game-[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWE_Raw_%28video_game%29](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWE_Raw_%28video_game%29)
Thanks in advance.
