- Post Title: .g32 graphics files... how to manage?

Hi Guys
this is doppiapunta.
I'm registered some time ago even if I follow you from a lot of time.
I have a trouble with a proprietry graphic file I really need to manage.
Unfortuntaley doen't exist a tool or program able to manage this kind of file.
I don't know which format is...so please..can you check it and tell me if there a way to convert this files to a know one ( BMP, JPEG etc) and to reconvert it to the original format?
The file belongs to Xanadu Next game..a very cool japan rpg.
I attach a sample file to this thread, its extension is .g32.
Bye Bye guys thank you for all your efforts
