- Post Title: Sheep, Dog 'n' Wolf / Looney Tunes Sheep Raider

Hey there boys and girls, dude and dudettes!

I want to translate a game called Looney Tunes - Sheep Raider, or Sheep, Dog 'n' Wolf, as some of you know it. It's an older game where you control Ralph, a coyote, and you have to steal lots of sheep while avoiding Sam, the shephard dog.

Now the text can be found in the MLT files in their respective folder. My problem is that when I modify even one bit of the file, then it wouldn't load, so no text will be displayed in the game. It doesn't matter if the file is exactly the same in size as before.

Does anyone know a solution for this? Note that I'm trying to translate the PC version, but I thought I'd translate the PS1 version too, but that's for another story

Bumping up this topic.

Here are level 00's files, maybe you can see where it's got a CRC check or something like that. Please, have a look at them -> [https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B2kV4D ... sp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B2kV4DFRb2cIQmtIVU01bDhmTTA/view?usp=sharing)

I loved this game as a kid. The piano part in the beginning confused the heck out of me. That scene couldn't be skipped, and it lasted quite a bit of time, so I always thought I should somehow avoid it. Silly me.

Anyway, I am interested in this too. I just tried to change an English text in Lvl-00 folder, and that caused the whole text for that level to disappear in game. I reverted the changes and saved the file once again, and it went back to normal. Strange.

Edit: I found the Russian version of the game. I compared it to the English version and I noticed that .dav files are modified as well as .mlt files. DAV files contain graphics of the game (including the font), judging by this link: [http://warsztat.gd/projects/sth_w_sdnw/info](http://warsztat.gd/projects/sth_w_sdnw/info). All the files in the Russian version are of the same size as in the original. Also, the Russian translation inside .mlt files isn't in Cyrillic. It uses the combination of Latin characters and numbers, but it is rendered perfectly fine in game. I would recommend you to somehow get in touch with the Polish guy from the link above since he is working on dissembling the game. I already left him a comment hoping he would see it.
