- Post Title: Prince Of Persia: Sands Of Time .BIN format

I'm looking to extract skeleton and anim data from .BIN files for Prince of Persia: Sands Of Time. I've downloaded the PersianRug tools already and that lets you get static model data and textures. I'm just looking for a bit more   

I've chanced my luck and I've already emailed Turfster since he's the one behind the PersianRug tools while I waited for my XeNTaX account to be activated. I just thought I'd ask here too to see if anyone else had any information.
