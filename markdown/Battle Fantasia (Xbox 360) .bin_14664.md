- Post Title: Battle Fantasia (Xbox 360) .bin

I'm trying to rip mugshots(from the Story Mode) from Battle Fantasia, but all I got is a decompressed(using xbdecompress.exe) .bin that I can't do stuff with it(the first 4 bytes are ....), I've aleardy tried everything that I can do get stuff out of it.

I would be appreciated if anyone can help me with this

EDIT: Here's a link with the .bin in question [assassidn.bin](https://mega.nz/#!P8JBlBrJ!BTCCYcI-AhNzCF4ohZ60QRt35OmvuS4a0bxxUnsmEjs)

There is an arcade version which is running on Windows XP Emebded (taito type x2)
You should look for that first. It might be easier to extract stuff from arcade version than xb360 version

The problem is, the arcade version doesn't have story mode so I can't rip the mugshots from them

you have an uncompressed archive here with what looks like 124 files inside
aluigi could possibly make a bms script to extract everything with their names   
Noesis can open the xpr textures in there
