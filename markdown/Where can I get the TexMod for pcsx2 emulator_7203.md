- Post Title: Where can I get the TexMod for pcsx2 emulator?

There's supposed to be a tool called TexMod which can mod/rip textures in ps2 games when using the emulator "pcsx2" but I can't find it & can only find a similar named tool for guildwars when I search using google, if you know where to find it then please give me a link to it.

TexMod is not only for PCSX2. The guildwars TexMod program may be the one you want. It works with a number of programs. I don't recall where I found mine though.

Apologies if this is necro, but it at least seemed pertinent info.
