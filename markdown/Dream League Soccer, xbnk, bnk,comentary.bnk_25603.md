Hi!! I need some help please!
I did an extraction for my [commentary.bnk](https://www.mediafire.com/file/qasv6333toduim0/commentary.bnk/file) using this script: [score_hero_bnk.bms (0.2.3a)](http://aluigi.altervista.org/bms/score_hero_bnk.bms). and I get a lot of oggs files, I edited some of them but the probleme is that I can't repack them into the original xbnk. I tried with reimport.bat using the same script above but no luck.
that's what I got...

Are you sure you're using reimport mode correctly?
You need to use the script on BNK file, not on OGG file.

Here's more info [http://aluigi.zenhax.com/papers/quickbms.txt](http://aluigi.zenhax.com/papers/quickbms.txt)

It should be something like this:

```
quickbms.exe -w -r score_hero_bnk.bms commentary.bnk output_folder
```

> I want to export/view a database file .DAT with 78 9C EC as a header

This file is compressed with ZLIB.
You can use offzip to decompress this [http://aluigi.altervista.org/mytoolz/offzip.zip](http://aluigi.altervista.org/mytoolz/offzip.zip)

```
offzip.exe -a teams.dat
```
