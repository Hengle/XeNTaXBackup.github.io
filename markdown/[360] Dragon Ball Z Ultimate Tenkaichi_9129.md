- Post Title: [360] Dragon Ball Z: Ultimate Tenkaichi

Hello all fellow game-engineers, 

Recently I came across a bizarre file format on a game called Dragon Ball Z: Ultimate Tenkaichi. I have successfully extracted the .afs files from the game's .iso file, however once I extract the .afs files with Noesis - i.e. from "st_pack_battle_character_pt_x360.afs" to a new folder, the files are just "0000_battl" or "0001_battl" they don't seem to contain any file extensions. The same goes with sounds and other files - accept for movies, for some odd reason they are not compressed and are "as is" in the .wmv format and are viewable with any default media player. However I'm completely stuck with the other files. 

I'm pretty new at extracting models and sounds from games, especially console games so don't be too harsh. I've tried searching the forums and Google but so far, nothing. Any help would be greatly appreciated. 

Thanks,
Brian.
