- Post Title: Pokémon HG/SS slot machines?

I found the way to restore the slot machines in Platinum, where the censorship was only via script and the graphic resource cleared.

In HG/SS the graphic was cleared too, but the script value that is the same of the japanese version, starts the censored Voltorb flip game.

Someone could try to discover via debugging what's happen in both version, US and JP, to discover if call a different ASM and if the original code is still in the international releases? I think yes, 'cause they cleared the graphic and the texts, to avoid of see and read gambling references discovering the game maybe trough cheat codes.

I have to say that I have never been a big fan of Pokemon, but I guess there are people who might be excited about having these slot machines.

Giving the amount of time that has passed since the initial post on this thread, I would like to get an update if you have managed to discover via debugging the script value that starts the censored Voltorb flip game? I am really glad that you found a way to restore the slot machines in Platinum, and I congratulate you on achieving that. I must say that I have no idea how to solve this issue and what happened, but I will be glad to have the answer here for those who might need it. Until then, I will continue to play [แทงบอล](https://www.u12x.com/%E0%B9%81%E0%B8%97%E0%B8%87%E0%B8%9A%E0%B8%AD%E0%B8%A5/) online for free at home, expecting better times for everyone.
