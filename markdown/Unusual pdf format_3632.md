- Post Title: Unusual pdf format?

Hi, I have recently came across this pdf, which as far as it is possible to prove is NOT corrupt, 
yet I can't open it with FoxIt Reader.

Viewing it with a file viewer shows different structure compared to my other pdf-s, 
but it does show a definite structure (and NOT something that looks corrupt)

Please help to open it!

there are 2 problems with your pdf

1. it's cut off in the middle (of stream data), it means it is not a complete file - i.e. corrupt
2. it's encrypted pdf


imho: combination of these 2 factors makes this file unuseable beyond repair
