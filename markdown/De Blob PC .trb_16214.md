Hey!
I know it's probably a little bit late    but made an Model Extractor for de blob!   
Only rips meshes (vertices, faces, uvs)
Use TrbTextureConverter to extract textures in tga format.

TrbModelConverter: [https://www.mediafire.com/file/101qd1ts ... r.exe/file](https://www.mediafire.com/file/101qd1tsfj7475s/TrbModelConverter.exe/file)

Have a nice day!

I have no clue how to parse bone data with the fbx sdk so if anyone could help me there I would be thankful.
And I haven't implemented Nicktoon Globe of Doom yet (main focus is still de blob).

Have a nice Day!

I recently looked into this thread again and I saw that the author actually wants to extract de blob 2 files but in the title it says just de blob. There is a major difference between blob and blob 2 because blob 2 uses the Prime Engine which is a bit like toshi but still very different. Anyways I made only for blob 2 (the prime engine was never used again) a extractor. I've made a github repo: [https://github.com/AdventureT/Bl2ModelConverter](https://github.com/AdventureT/Bl2ModelConverter)

And for de blob or in general the toshi engine, I'm currently rewritting the whole program because it was/is unclean and unstable. I will update any news about the toshi engine extractor here.   

I'm in a discord server where one of the creators of the toshi/prime engine joined and I'm more active there than on xentax. So if you would like to join: [https://discord.gg/thPqVRd](https://discord.gg/thPqVRd)

Sorry for hijacking the thread, but do you know how to extract Barnyard's TRB files? It uses Toshi engine.
