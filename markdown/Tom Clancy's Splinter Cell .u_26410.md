Hello, I need a tool to unpack/pack .u file of Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell
This file contains fonts, I checked it with Dragon UnPACKer 5

This file is archive from Unreal Engine 2.

You can see list of tools supporting Unreal Engine games here 
[http://wiki.xentax.com/index.php/List_o ... gine_Tools](http://wiki.xentax.com/index.php/List_of_Unreal_Engine_Tools)

One of them which works with your sample is Unreal Package Extractor --> [https://www.gildor.org/downloads](https://www.gildor.org/downloads)

This tool can extract the file, but not repack it

So... check out some other tools. You have the list now, don't you?

This may be helpful as well (but only for basic concept of importing in UE games - using hex editor etc.)
