- Post Title: character extract from a ps3 game or xbox 360 game

Hello everybody! I want tomorrow to buy a game (dragon ball z raging blast 2) and then try to extract the caracters from the game and import them in ,,esf" (  a mod for half life, dragon ball mod, really cool). I know how to rig the models and import  in the esf (earth special forces), but i don't know from which verson is easier to extract the caracters. Is it easier to extract them from the ps3 version or the xbox 360 version?

I would assume 360 cause everyone seems to be ripping 360 games all over the place.

I would still assume 360 because PS2 seems to have all sorts of hardware-related optimizations embedded in the format.
Compared to other platforms, PS1 and PS2 seem to have the least amount of importers I think.

I used 360 version for the first ragging blast with revelation's plugin for noesis. So that's your answer.

See ya

Use noesis to extract the content of the game or look for xboxbackupcreator. The data is encrypted so unless you have the correct browser and extractor you won't be able to extract the files.

I did extracted everything from the game arhive, here is a picture [http://img12.imageshack.us/img12/6838/dragonballb.jpg](http://img12.imageshack.us/img12/6838/dragonballb.jpg) . As you can see all i extracted from the game are these .afs file. i though the 3d modles shoud be in the ,,st_pac_game_at_pt_x360.afs" because is the bigest file, so i use noesis to extract everything that was in that file. But now what program do i have to use to open the extracted files from the .afs file ?

change file name extension *.asf to *.afsd, open with Noesis 

here's a afsd plugin for Noesis.

YEEEEEEES finally i extracted 1 model, but i have some problem with the texture, here is a picture [http://img442.imageshack.us/img442/2668/111231.jpg](http://img442.imageshack.us/img442/2668/111231.jpg) . And is there any plugin to extract the maps ? I saw some filer called map.spr and i imported in noesis, but when i import them nothing hapends. Do i need a new plugin for the maps, or it's impossible to export the maps ? And is it possible to import the characters animations and characters voices ?
