Hiya all, ive been told to look for someone called 'FatDuck' who may be able to help our community find a way of converting IL2 msh files - to & from 3ds max / 3ds file format.

We are desperate and have been looking for help in various places. It would totally revolutionise the game if we were able to put our own meshes into the game. Currently we can only borrow other parts of 3d from the game to create new parts. So for example if we want a new cockpit we would have to borrow one from another aircraft & then you obviously end up with a cockpit that dosnt belong to that aircraft!

Our community is growing rapidly & i would love to give you the address of our web site but im not sure about your policy regarding links ect. Once we started we got 4500 members in just under 3 months! however sadly there is so much we cant do as we have no way of getting new 3d into the game.

Please can someone help us make this a reality

(if anyone can help please pm me for a 3d sample from the game)

many thx in advance
Jolly

Hi,

I have been trying to crack the msh format for a few months. The result is the program which can be downloaded from [http://www.cmmods.com](http://www.cmmods.com), see section Theatre of War and "Msh Binary Reader v0.1", problems are decoding the data itself. They have some compressing technics for floats, vectors and indexes.
