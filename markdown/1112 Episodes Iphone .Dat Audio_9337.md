- Post Title: 1112 Episodes Iphone .Dat Audio

Hello.

I'm new on the site and I'm not very familiar with quickbms language.
I'm looking for a way to extract the musics from the Iphone game serie 1112 Episodes.
For now I'm working with the first episode.
Inside the .ipa file, I've found 3 files : Data1.dat, Data2.dat and Data3.dat.

With notepad++ I've seen some MP3tags inside those files.
Is there somebody to help to figure out the code to use with quickbms to extract the files ?

Thanks in advance ^^.

EDIT : Of course I can send you the .dat files if you're interested.
