- Post Title: modified dxt textures from warhammer online

I've managed to extract out the textures for armor/mobs/chars in warhammer online, and they appear to contain dxt texture data, but I'm not very good with reversing texture data, and haven't been able to figure it out. the header seems to contain 10 entries with uint32 size, uint16 width,uint16 height, uint16 unk1, uint16 unk2 which i thought might be mipmaps, but the lengths don't seem to account for the entire file, so I don't know, here's an example of some of the files, they are named .png, but they aren't actually pngs
