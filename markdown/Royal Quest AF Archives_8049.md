I have done everything but the only missing field is recognizing what files are referred to what AF archives because I see no informations about them.
and no, the entries are not sequentials so there is no trick to use for automatically doing it

Download and install [Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 Redistributable Package](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=5555). This is necessary to run the unpacker.

Then download [rqaf_extract.zip](http://narod.ru/disk/55579461001.13478f9a3359a98fc110630228dde8a1/rqaf_extract.zip.html), extract it and place rqaf_extract.exe to root of Royal Quest game.

Files of game will extracted to data.extracted folder in root of the game.

If you find errors, please contact me.

Yes. I know about this problem. Some files have incorrect index equal to 0xFFFF or 0xFFFE. This files may be obsolete or anything else. I can not identify the package in which they are.

I checked it out.

Total size of files in .toc table is 1,856,860,055.
Total size of valid files is 1,784,384,645.
Total size of invalid files (with index 0xFFFF or 0xFFFE) is 72,475,410.

Total size of files in .af files on hard drive is 1,832,910,848. Subtract from this value service data of archives and you'll get the value 1,784,384,645.

Files with index 0xFFFF or 0xFFFE are obsolete or are somewhere else. They are not in the .af packages.

Great tool! But does anyone know how to pack files back to *.af for modding purposes?
I mean: unpack data -> change some textures -> repack.
