- Post Title: NexusTK .epf Tile Palette

Hi all,

I actually stumbled onto this forum trying to figure out this format from this post: [viewtopic.php?f=11&t=1726â€‹](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=11&t=1726%E2%80%8B)  

NexusTK is a 2D MMORPG.

There is a Map Editor for the game:
[http://www.mediafire.com/file/zxsuz45jv ... Editor.zip](http://www.mediafire.com/file/zxsuz45jv9g72k4/NexusTK-Map_Editor.zip)

This editor will use the provided /Data/ to allow a user to create .MAP files

I am interested in converting the EPF/PAL/TBL format to some sort of spritesheet.
I wanted to use graphics from a game I use to play years ago for a hobby project 2D game   

I believe that the relevant files are:

```
TileA1.pal
TileA2.pal
TileA3.pal
TileA4.pal
TileA5.pal
TileA6.pal
TileA7.pal
TileA.epf
TileA.tbl
```


In the other thread (link above), Omnilord suggested the following for each image type:

> .tbl - describes the structure 
>
> .pal - describes the pallette 
>
> .epf - stores tile data as described in the .tbl and .pal files.

Tiles are 24x24 (in the editor program)

I am assuming the actual data for the images is stored in the EPF files, which gets the colors from the PAL (palette file)
I further presume that the variants of TileA{0-9} is the "shades" of lightness/darkness as the game goes from night to day.
Maybe all that is needed is: 1 PAL file, 1 EPF file, and 1 TBL file (TileA0.pal, TileA.epf, TileA.tbl) -- further simplifying my end goal (I only need the brightest version, 0 or 9).

Diffing hex versions of: TileA0.pal and TileA1.pal show very small differences, so maybe it's variations of itself (shades).
Diffing hex versions of: TileA.epf and TileB.epf shows many differences, which smells like the actual data.

I'm uncertain how the TBL file fits into all of this though.
"describes the structure". I would think that the EPF file was doing the description of how to present the PAL colors, but that doesn't include the TBL file.

Any help would be appreciated, thanks!!

This should be the file format (In C-like syntax).
Convert the files to bmp shouldn't be a big deal but I don't have the time for this right now.
Maybe someone else can work with this information.


Tile*.tbl:

```
int numbPalettes;
byte[3] unknown;
short[numTiles] paletteIndex;
```

Tile*.pal:

```
color[256] palette;

typedef struct {
  byte blue;
  byte green;
  byte red;
  byte padding; // usually 0x04
} color;
```

Tile*.epf:

```
short width;
short height;
short unknown; // always 0
int pixelDataLength;
byte[pixelDataLength] pixelData;
tableEntry[numTiles] table;

typedef struct {
  int unknown;
  short width;
  short height;
  int offsetPixelData;
  int offsetUnknown;
} tableEntry;

// additional info about the pixelData:
typedef struct {
  byte[width * height] paletteIndex;
  byte[height] unknown; // usually 0x98
} tile;
```


I haven't figured out what's going on in SObj.tbl. Apparently the tiles from TileC are put together to bigger objects in this file.

Thank you so much herbert3000 for taking the time to look into this!!

I should be able to piece together the headers in a script to create the bmps, no worries there   

I am extremely curious on your process here..

What tools did you use to analyze these files? Was it file extension knowledge, or was something obvious in the hex that gave the structure away?

Thank you again!

TileA*.pal Format:

```
color[256] palette;

typedef struct {
  byte blue;
  byte green;
  byte red;
  byte padding; // usually 0x04
} color;
```


The header for the PAL files may be byte[32] (or byte[0x20]).

This adds up to the files size:

4 bytes * 256 colors + 32 bytes = 1056

$ du -b TileA0.pal
>> 1056

The TBL syntax should be correct though (I wrote a Python class to store it for now)

Success!

I'm gonna write a simple PyQt5 interface to export individual tiles (or all tiles - bulk).

I added MAP file handling to the EPFViewer Github repo as well. I am starting to understand how the SObj.tbl incorporates. This appears to be "Static Objects", where groups of 10 Tiles are arranged vertically.

MAPHandler is not complete. MAP files appear to have full integers dedicated to storing an ID (short -- bytes). The other short appeared to be unused, but I am now beginning to think Tile C are for the other 2 bytes (short). This allows walls to "mix/blend" with ground tiles

I am getting really close. I also have incorporated much of the SObj.tbl (grouping TileC tiles).

What I'm struggling with is the alpha layer, and it appears that there may be compression some sort of cipher to mix pixels around?

Anyone have any ideas?:

Thanks in advance!

Counting the pixel padding (top and left) of alpha layer, I'm recognizing a pattern:

08 00 06 00 18 00 18 00 00 00 00 00 20 01 00 00

Using our structure for a tile_entry:

```
  int unknown
  short width
  short height
  int pixel_data_offset
  int unknown_offset
} tile_entry
```


I think the first unknown int is the "top" and "left" pad for alpha

08 00 and 06 00 (8-top, 6-left):


This is usually 00 00 00 00 for TileA and TileB, but those don't appear to have alpha layers.

Getting closer!

Added some logic to put the cropped images in 24x24 blocks for rendering. Looking better:



The 10th block in doesn't look right, but its tile_entry is:

[08 00] [00 00] [18 00] [0E 00] [EA 11 00 00] [CA 12 00 00]

pad_top = 0x08
pad_left = 0x00
width = 0x18 (24 pixels)
height = 0x0E (14 pixels)



Looks like the assumed height and width are swapped 

Here's another odd one:

[13 00] [00 00] [18 00] [03 00] [16 E8 01 00] [25 E8 01 00]

pad_top = 0x13 (19 pixels)
pad_left = 0x00
width = 0x18 (24 pixels)
height = 0x03 (3 pixels)



Appears to check out..

Figured out the "Static Objects" (SObj.tbl) file and incorporated a viewer scroll area for it as well:


This is to mimic the Map Editor functionality:


Roadmap:

* Add functionality to read in *.MAP files and view/export to BMP
* EPF tile injection/deletion
* Map creator? X-by-Y maps

Added MAP Viewer functionality (Open > Map File (*.map)).

This reads in and displays MAP files made with the Map Editor Program (not EPF Viewer).

Github's [@DDeokk](https://github.com/DDeokk) generously provided more information pertaining to EPF and PAL file structures in the [EPFViewer Issues section](https://github.com/DizzyThermal/EPFViewer/issues).

Planning on implementing soon - stay tuned

Hi Dizzy,

Not sure if you need any of this information for your tool, or even if you want your tool to work with other images in the game, but here is some additional information about the following archives...
arrow, body, bow, coat, emotion, face, facedec, fan, hair, hairdec, helmet, mantle, neck, shield, shoes, spear, sword

These archives all have 2 corresponding entries in the file char.dat with the extensions PAL and DSC. The PAL one is the format you describe on your GitHub, but the DSC one is different. It kinda takes the place of the TBL file used by the tiles.

This is the DSC format, to the best of my knowledge so far...

```
  7 - null
  1 - Unknown (1)
  4 - Number of Parts
  
  // for each part (610 bytes per part)
    4 - Part ID (incremental from 0)
    4 - Palette ID Number
    4 - First Tile Number for this Part
    4 - Number of Tiles for this Part
    1 - Unknown (2)
    4 - Unknown
    1 - Unknown (4)
    4 - Unknown
    4 - Unknown
    4 - Number of Chunks (12)
  
    // for each chunk
      4 - Unknown ID
      4 - Unknown (-1/0)
      4 - Number of Blocks (4x4, then 4x2, then 4x6, to make the total of 12 blocks)
    
      // for each block
        1 - Unknown ID
        4 - null
        4 - Unknown (-1)

```


On order to read the images from the EPF files and map them to the correct PAL palette, you need to use the following fields above...

```
    4 - First Tile Number for this Part
    4 - Number of Tiles for this Part

```


For each Part, you can read the 3 fields above. The first one gives the palette ID for all images in the Part. The "First Tile Number" is the ID of the first image in the EPF file that belongs to this Part, and the "Number of Tiles" tells you the number of images in the Part.

For an example, the first entry in the DSC file might have "First Tile Number" = 0 and "Number of Tiles" = 20. In this case, all the images from 0-19 in the EPF file belong to this Part, and all use the same Palette. The second DSC entry might have "First Tile Number" = 20 and "Number of Tiles" = 8. In this case, images 20-27 belong to the Part.

The EPF file is basically the same as you wrote on GitHub, but I needed to work out the width of the image data in the EPF file as "Width = Width + (0-X Position)" and similarly for the height of the image data.

As for the Chunks and the Blocks - I have no idea what they represent, and I haven't really looked further in to them, as it isn't needed for reading the images. That said, I assume it's either something to do with the animation of the images, or placement of the images relative to other images, something like that I guess.

Hope this helps.

And for the remaining archives...

Effects (efx.dat)...

```
  4 - Number of Tiles
  
  // for each tile
    4 - Color Palette Number

```


Very simple. Seemed to be 40 images short of the number listed in the FRM file, but the images looked ok when I applied the palettes to them, so not sure what's going on there.


Monsters (mon.dat)...

```
  4 - Number of Monsters
  
  // for each monster...
    4 - First Image ID
    1 - Number of Blocks
    1 - Unknown
    2 - Palette Number
    
    // for each Block
      2 - Number of Chunks
      
      // for each chunk
        2 - Unknown ID
        2 - Unknown ID
        2 - Unknown (-1)
        2 - null
        1 - null

```


Pretty sure the chunks represent the direction that the "monster" image is facing, and things like that. Haven't really explored in to it though.


For the EFX and MON, they both have EPF and PAL files as well, which are the same as all the others.

Hope this helps you, if you're so interested.

friendsofwatto, thank you for the information, I appreciate it!

The file_reader module is intended to handle all TK file formats, so these are great additions!

As for where/how to present all the different image formats/types in the QT5 GUI is another question. I'm open to suggestions on GUI/layout structure as this is not my forte

friendsofwatto,

I got more time to look into the other file types. I am trying to read a Shield:

Shield0.epf
Shield.dsc
Shield.pal

Shield.pal expands into multiple palettes, which I handle, but when I try to read the EPF similar to the tiles (w/TBL) I get back negative numbers.

Here is how I am reading the DSC file:

```
class DSCHandler(FileHandler):
    _PART_COUNT_POS = 23

    def __init__(self, *args):
        super(DSCHandler, self).__init__(*args)
        self.seek(self._PART_COUNT_POS)
        self.part_count = self.read('int')
        self.parts = []
        for i in range(self.part_count):
            part = {}
            part['id'] = self.read('int')
            part['palette_id'] = self.read('int')
            part['frame_index'] = self.read('int')
            part['frame_count'] = self.read('int')
            self.seek(14, whence=1)
            part['chunk_count'] = self.read('int')
            part['chunks'] = []
            for j in range(part['chunk_count']):
                chunk = {}
                chunk['id'] = self.read('int')
                chunk['unk'] = self.read('int')
                chunk['block_count'] = self.read('int')
                chunk['blocks'] = []
                for k in range(chunk['block_count']):
                    block = {}
                    block['id'] = self.read('byte')
                    self.seek(4, whence=1)
                    block['unk'] = self.read('int')
                    chunk['blocks'].append(block)
                part['chunks'].append(chunk)
            self.parts.append(part)
```


I then wrote this script to try to save the first 20 frames of the first part:

            sub_image.putdata(pixel_bytes)

            image = Image.new('RGBA', (24, 24), background_color)
            image.paste(sub_image, (frame['left'], frame['top']))
        else:

            image.putdata(pixel_bytes)

        image.save('C:\\Shield\\frame{}.bmp'.format(i))
```


I get the following error when I try to run it:

Anything wrong with my interpretation of your DSC post?

Thanks!

I think the blocks are where I'm misreading:

```
4 - Number of Blocks (4x4, then 4x2, then 4x6, to make the total of 12 blocks)
```


I started working out the file and the blocks stopped making sense:

```

```


I'm sure it's due to the block offset being wrong

Updating this a bit with some calculations:

```
Length of Header: 0x1B
Number of Parts: 0x38

(0xE94B - 0x1B) / 0x38 = 0x42A || 1066 bytes
```

Part Size is 0x42A (1066) bytes

I could parse the file by part boundary and ignore chunk/block data, but I'd like to figure out how to properly read it

Figured out my issue.

The issue was that in the EPF File's frames, the top, right, bottom, left - shorts are suppose to be signed, not unsigned.

how do i do this? i downloaded and compiled your github thing. i can't get the tiles to display. all it brings up is a viewer of items and stuff but no tiles.
