- Post Title: TEXTILE IMGS  / GRAPHICS

Hello everyone, new to the forum.

I was looking for help on something, it's a very specific question. It's regarding Vectorman 1 & 2 for SEGA genesis.

I was looking to extract the image/textile/graphics of only the backgrounds.

Everytime you start a new level there is a wallpaper of sorts in the background. However, since this is not moving or gif, it should just be a regular img file.

I don't know much about decompiling .smd or rom files. I could decomp DUKE3D and DOOM in my sleep. I'm lost on this subject though.

Anyone who knows how to extract the images? I have been wanting these wallpaper type graphics for a very long time. 

However I could be wrong, they could be 2D/3D models, it seems that all the imgs are setup that way. Like I said though, don't know much on this.

Thanks.

I'm really looking for one background in particular. If someone could grab it or extract it and post it here, I would be very grateful.

It's from VECTORMAN 1, Level/Day 13 "DARK RUINS"

I just want the bg, no vectorman or anything else included.

Thankyee
