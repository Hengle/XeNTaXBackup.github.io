- Post Title: 3dxml to any file format

Sup guys. I have an account with Dassault Systems. If you have 3dxml files I will convert them for you for free, just send me the 3dxml file.

I also have other 3d modeling programs that have a wide range of exported file types so let me know what file extension you need your 3d model to be in.

If you want your file to remain private, PM me with a download link. I will not share your model with anyone and your 3d file is deleted from my hard drive after I send you the converted file type.
