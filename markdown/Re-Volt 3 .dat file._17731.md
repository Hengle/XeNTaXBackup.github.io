Hi,
It's been a long time since i last tried to rip from this game. I got the car and map models but still can't seem to figure out the textures.There are sort of shader files in the materials folder but can seem to convert it to other format either or maybe I'm talking about the wrong files.
Using UABE I found that these files might contain the texture files.
Here are some .dat files from Materials folder: [https://app.box.com/s/s4k10m8osyixltrvyywon66hyg36otm2](https://app.box.com/s/s4k10m8osyixltrvyywon66hyg36otm2)
Any help would be much appreciated.

The shader files are just plain text files and contain no texture data. I'm not 100% certain but I suspect the textures may be in a non-standard file format and need to be extracted from the .dat files themselves and then converted. When looking at a car's .dat files I can only view and extract textures for the antenna and shadow. The diffuse and normal textures for the body and wheels are not there or are not able to be viewed. It might also be a case where the textures are in a separate location from the models and must be downloaded from the game's remote server cache.
