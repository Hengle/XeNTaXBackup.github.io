- Post Title: Request for Wolverine and Captain America models

Hi guys

Currently we are working on a project which deals with data visualization. We want to visualize the sales figures of some comic characters (Marvel and DC). The result will be an animation with Cinema 4D. Therefor we need 3D models of each character. Most of them were found in the internet, some others were provided by kind 3D artists for this project. It's a project for the HfG Schwaebisch Gmuend, which is a university of design in Germany, we are studying Interaction Design here in the 2nd semester (so sorry for my english at this point  ).
Is there someone who could either extract these models from a game or already has them in an appropriate 3D format, so that we can rig and weight them in Cinema (can be .obj, .fbx, .max or something like that)?
It would be a huge help for us if we could get the models because we are really running out of time and unfortunately have to leave these two characters out of the animation if we don't have the models.

Kind regards 
Sven
