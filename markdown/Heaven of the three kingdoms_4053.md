- Post Title: Heaven of the three kingdoms

Here is a game from hanbitsoft called Heaven of the three kingdoms:



I am still downloading but I have put up an archive on filefront(forgot to look at acceptable upload pages so hope its ok). It's called npc.pfs.

I just copyed ~10mb of the beginning and the end of the archive. I searched in it and found PK and ZIP in some places but PK was not at the beginning like it always is. So trying PKZIP did not help me.

The whole client takes 4.5gb so I guess dropping some smaller files here is better

where are the archives?
have you tried the zip.bms script of quickbms?
if it's an incomplete or invalid zip it will extract the contained files without problems
