- Post Title: Sudeki - Modding Capabilities

Hi all,

I'm just posting to enquire about Sudeki, an old game I've actually been continuously playing since its release.

Has anyone had any prior progress on an extractor, any research done or being able to rebuild the game from the existing files?

I'm looking for people who are interested in getting some sort of modding capability going with this game as an end goal, or at least begin to.

Thanks,
Xlatyl.

Do gex files load up in Gamemaker studio ?


I saw that web page about a legacy extension for gex files:
[https://docs.yoyogames.com/source/dadio ... sions.html](https://docs.yoyogames.com/source/dadiospice/001_advanced%20use/extensions/legacy%20extensions.html)

Gamemaker Trial:

The big baf file:
BAF stands for Infinity Game Engine Script ( BioWare Corp.)
No idea if it's the same BAF type.

I remember playing this on an old console many years ago ,one of those games i always remember.

Not a great deal of info out there about this game .

EDIT:
Found this interesting topic ,looks like it was an in-house custom game engine:

Mary Ann Skweres talks with the developers of the role-playing game Sudeki about their creative and technical processes.

" All the technology was created for Sudeki from the ground-up. The rendering engine, animation system and sound system were all created specifically for Sudeki. In addition we use the hard-drive of Xbox to stream the game data, so the player encounters a minimal number of loading screens during the gameplay."

Have you had a chat with [lezisell](https://www.deviantart.com/lezisell/art/Sudeki-Buki-Mist-Tiger-XPS-ONLY-663850766)? 
He managed to extract a few characters from the game.
