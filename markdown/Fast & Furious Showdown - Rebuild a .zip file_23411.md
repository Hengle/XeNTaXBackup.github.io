Any tools to rebuild vfs.zip of this game? I tried rebuild with Winrar and 7zip. Both results crash the game.

Is it some special kind of zip file? Is it password protected or with custom compression or something?

Its not password protected. I can extract the content freely. Btw the vfs.zip is related to vfs.bin and vfs.dat.
