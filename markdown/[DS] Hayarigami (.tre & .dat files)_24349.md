- Post Title: [DS] Hayarigami (.tre & .dat files)

Can someone help find out what Hayarigami DS's .dat and .tre files contain and are used for? Each .dat file has a .tre file with the same name so I think the files are connect to each other. Help with this is would be much appreciated   
Sample files:

As for DAT file, it is some data compressed with NitroSDK compression. 
You can use this script to decompress data [viewtopic.php?p=177118#p177118](https://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?p=177118#p177118)

As for TRE file, it seems to be some index file for DAT file.
But as far as I know it is completely custom, so someone would need to reverse engineer file format to tell you more.
