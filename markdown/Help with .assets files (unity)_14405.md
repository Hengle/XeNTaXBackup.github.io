- Post Title: Help with .assets files (unity)

So I'm using the Unity Assets Explorer (Version 1.4) to extract assets (specifically I was looking for .dds files), and I was extracting the assets just fine. Then, the game updated and new .assets files were added. I tried to open them, but I got an error that says "TProgressBar property out of range".

Also, before anyone says anything, I have all ready googled to try and find something to help, but all I found was some scripts I have no idea where (I'm assuming the UAE) or how to use.
Can someone help?
