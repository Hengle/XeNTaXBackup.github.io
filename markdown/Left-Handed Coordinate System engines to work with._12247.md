- Post Title: Left-Handed Coordinate System engines to work with.

After being in 3DS Max in a while, it's okay when you just want to get some meshes, but when it comes time to something more advance, it becomes more complex in my opinion.

The reason i'm going to ask this is because i have been stuck for a year in trying to get animations from a format, and i belive no matter how hard i try i won't be able to get them right.

So the question is, What 3d left handed coordinate system engines would you recommend me to do the same thing?
With left handed we can also say that Y is the height.

The short answer could b e maya, but my format has a lot of models with the same name and special characters, something Maya gives a lot of issues, so i'm forced to discard it.

I was wondering if there was more stuff out there to work with that has some binary readers to use.

Thanks in advance:
