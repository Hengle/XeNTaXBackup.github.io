Yes, and don't think I don't want to help Rahly fixing this, but I'm in the midst of my marriage system.  

AND I plan to fix my piece for the tutorial Watto and I are working on this weekend, so you begging people can figure out your own formats next time  

Cheers!

Well, we will have a new plugin system, that will allow other programmers to format plugins, that will integrate with Mexcom.  This system will allow one plugin to handle multiple formats or even multiple games if need be.  Although, its my plan to have one plugin per game, or per gaming format, like 2 or 3 games have the same format, but just slightly different.

I see you don't fully understand. 

We will make the plugin available for download when it's done, in effect, when it's completed (finished, put together, coded, tried and tested). 

The Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA), also known as the Time before Completion (TBC), of the plugin is as of yet still unknown. 

Thus, ETAplugin = TBCplugin = Unknown.

The encryption is a XOR with an incremental value.
I have written an extractor for this game:
