Is it possible to extract the content of a .ar (Racer) file? As I know the .ar is a crypted file to protect the .dof files inside.

Thanks Aluigi !!

Was looking for this...

Works perfectly !

======================
Just a question about the dof file which gets extracted, does anyone know if that file can be easily converted to 'known' format like obj or even collada ? 

The reason is, Ruud (C++ coder of Racer) didn't implement any function in his 'modeler' program or even 'tracked', so the 'existing' cars & tracks can't 'actually' be fixed/exported to 3DS/Maya/SoftImage...

Check it, it's a free & powerful car simulator
