- Post Title: How do I edit a font file with .dat format?

I want to translate Kindergarten 2 game into Turkish language. Since the game engine is Unity, files (such as resource.assets) are prepared with Unity 2020, UnityEX cannot open it, I used UABE Avalonia instead. I found and extracted the text files. Back packaging is being done. But Font file export is "different" There are txt, json and RAW options to export, it exports as dat with RAW. But I cannot edit the font file because it is not ttf. This is my only problem.

In-game view of characters that are not displayed:

As can be seen, some characters cannot be displayed at all, while some characters are displayed with another font.

Below are the pictures I opened the file with notepad and hex editor.

Hello, what is the name of the game?
For what platform?
What language are you translating to?

I want to translate Kindergarten 2 into Turkish, but some language-specific characters do not appear.
Characters: Çç İı İi Ğğ Öö Şş Üü âÂ êÊ

I have edited the subject content, thanks for the idea.

I think he had a version of UnityEX available for purchase so he could extract it in otf/ttf format. Then he would edit it with Fon Edit and repackage it.
Since UnityEX is paid, I looked for an alternative, I could only find UABE Avalonia, but I couldn't extract font files, so I asked for help. Then they recommended UABE Avalonia, which is very good for tex files, but for font files... It breaks some supported characters when extracting font files. I think it will be fixed with an update. If it is fixed, I think it can be a free competitor to the paid UnitEX.

I did not need to use UnityEx to create new accents or change them as you suggested.
I just edited and created them using UABEA.

Using UABEA I was only able to learn how to extract, edit and repackage TXT. I wanted to learn about fonts because I don't know anything about them. Also you did a nice job with adding characters, good work.

In 2018 I had the same problems as you, but I dedicated myself and studied.
After 1 year of study discover and learn how to edit font in unity, I did it by myself.
Today I know how to edit the simple ones and the more complicated ones.
I had several experiences in other languages, I played several games, I dedicated a lot to understand. In short, it was not easy.
It doesn't matter which tool you use, the important thing is how you know how to use the tool.
And this game's font is the easiest to edit.
