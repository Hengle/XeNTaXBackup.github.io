Some indication how "easy" would be to open it could be found in this interview with the creator of this game: 
[http://web1.vs185237.vserver.de/TCNY/th ... d53a452839](http://web1.vs185237.vserver.de/TCNY/thread.php?threadid=6&sid=0ec39fc860aebb9d8ef8c8d53a452839)
Nevertheless I must admit it looks very impressive. Is it like Simcity?  Or you can rotate views smoothly around the models?

Hi guys
I have made some progress with Tycoon City models, you can read about it here : [http://ffab.mypage.sk/viewtopic.php?t=42](http://ffab.mypage.sk/viewtopic.php?t=42)

I would be happy if someone could continue on the model research.

Mirex, great and interesting work. 

I have d/l and tried your nifty Biturn viewer/converter and just wanted to confirm that those shimmering surfaces are as a result of several LODs "sitting" on one another in the main DM model. I can easily split them and separate in any 3ds Editor. 

I and afraid at the moment cannot assist or help you in decoding DM, but if you need anything in terms of cleaning or editing the models etc. let me know and I gladly try to assist you.
