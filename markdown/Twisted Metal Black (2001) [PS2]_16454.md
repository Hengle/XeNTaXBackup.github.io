nice point clouds but autocreated face indices don't work - maybe use of quads required?

I used PCSX2 to rip the textures and models then the PCSX2 Model Converter to fix RGB values on the textures and projections on the mesh. Only problem is that deleted the UV map, or twisted it beyond repair. So what I did was imported the rip, merged the layers I needed for the textures. Exported the model, opened my fixed projection model. Cut the parts out that were the same on the UV map. Then replaced the map from the projected to the regular. Yeah.. time consuming lol but in the end it worked. I did all the Twisted Metals.
