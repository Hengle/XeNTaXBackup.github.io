- Post Title: str extensions???

Hi I am looking around in my godfather game folder and I see that all the objects and mission scripts are all *str extension files. Does anyone have an idea what is this str??? or how do you open them? I tried to replace model str files like you did in mafia if u wanted to replace a model. I replaced the boxer with a butcher model and the game worked fine until I went into bar on the second floor where the boxer supposed to be and when the boxer model object came into my render area the game crashed. 

Thats sad

I don't have the game, so i can't check. Perhaps you should attach an example.

Thanks, now we can take a look at it!

[EDIT] It sure looks like a model file, this is more in Xela's league, I think. Why not post it in the 3d Models forum?

i didn't know that there is a model file .
i examine it with Hex Workshop  and saw that it contaned some DDS files.
so i guessed the package conntaine of several DDS.
these file don't have header but when i changed them the game crashed. 
i want to know that can we extract these DDS files or watch there by using a header.
or change one model by another model it 's a best ....
u think we can ?
