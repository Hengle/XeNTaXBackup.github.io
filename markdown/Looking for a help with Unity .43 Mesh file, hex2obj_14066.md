Hello everyone, I want to extract some 43 mesh files from unity
But I am not very familiar with this binary format
I found shakotay2's hex2obj here, but because of my poor hex knowledge, after some days researching, still no progress on the files
sorry about that, because I think hex2obj is very powerful, but I can't use it well 
Is there anyone can help me with that?
there are two files

finale00 has a noesis script on his dropbox that opens your samples

I have attached the script because his dropbox is generating too much traffic and is disabled

Wow! Great it works!
This script can support the latest version of unity models
