- Post Title: Baldur's Gate 3 textures

Hello!

Ive got a problem with the textures.

The texture come in couple of variations: NM, CLAE, HMVY and MSK.
NM and MSK are normal maps and masks.
But CLAE and HMVY are pretty strange to me, and I cant figure out how to work with them. Ive tried combining them but no luck, its all looking strange and wrong, I mean, the colors - I cant get them right and make them look like in-game.

How do you make them look good? (Software Im using is Blender)

Sorry for bad English :p


Edit 1: The files are .DDS. Attached an image example (wich is jpg)

Assuming it like Larian did in DOS2 is PBR and each channel holds a different map, try separating the channels and see if that works for you.
There is a dedicated Discord for BG3 modding, i think some are alraedy working on this so I am just waiting patiently  and letting the DOS2 veterans figure it out.
