- Post Title: Final Fantasy X model rendering

I am interested in rendering models from Final Fantasy X (I have the PC HD remaster game). I unpacked all the files with the VBF extractor and got to the point of the dds.phyre and dae.phyre files. After that I tried using the phyre engine tools ([viewtopic.php?f=16&t=16930](https://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=16930)) but the ffx.exe  keeps crashing. So I used the extractor from [viewtopic.php?f=16&t=11107&start=30](https://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=11107&start=30) thread. This worked and I ended up with obj and dds files. However I am unable to put them together and render them in a meaningful way.

I have no experience with modding whatsoever. I tried to render the model and texture after seeing some blender tutorials, but I didn't get anywhere.

I actually don't intend to modify the models. I just need to render them (I plan to use the game for a neural networks project). Also, I only need to render the character and monsters (and maybe npcs). I don't need to render the maps. 

Can someone please point me in the right direction? Thanks in advance.
