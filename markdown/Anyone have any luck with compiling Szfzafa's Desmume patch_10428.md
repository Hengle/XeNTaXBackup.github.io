- Post Title: Anyone have any luck with compiling Szfzafa's Desmume patch?

OK, so I tried pasting the code posted here:
[viewtopic.php?f=16&t=5709&start=75](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=5709&start=75)

...but the problem is that while some of it seemed straightforward, I'm bloody puzzled as to where the hell do I have to append the lines in their respective files. Compiling it always results in numerous build errors in gfx3d.cpp.

I needed to get some 3D models from a bunch of DS games so bad. Problem is that none of them use the standard Nintendo resource formats.

I had similar trouble, and eventually left a comment on their blog before giving up... I wonder if they replied to me...

He did once, but his instructions for patching the source is waaaay to vague. He could've at least posted a modified gfx3d.cpp file instead.
