> In all the cutscenes, the characters repeat the line, then it goes to the next section. This happens with all of them. Here's an example: https://www.dropbox.com/s/blhu8dl51pzr26w/BFW_19687.wav One cutscene, for some reason, no khz works on it. It will not sound right no matter what khz it's on. This is the one I'm talking about: https://www.dropbox.com/s/2muj2hejmslpa1v/BFW_21049.wav
seems to be stereo (with a channel interleave) 22khz. (my bad) the reason it repeats is because its interleaving between left and right channels when you do it as mono. I could be wrong about that though, but interleave/offset is my guess.
