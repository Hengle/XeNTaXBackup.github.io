- Post Title: Secret Agent Clank [PS2] "san.cooked" file.

Well, though I'm not a total fan of the Ratchet and Clank series, they do interest me. Clank himself and the villains mostly. In particular this specific game interests me most of all. Fortunately, most of the internal files are simple enough to decode, for example the videos are all simple BIK files which can easily be played with the proper player. Most of the other image files are bmp, dds, or tga. However the models are an unknown format to me.

Here are two examples. Have a look if you can and let me know what you find out. I'll do more researching myself but I'm not very intelligent in this aspect.
