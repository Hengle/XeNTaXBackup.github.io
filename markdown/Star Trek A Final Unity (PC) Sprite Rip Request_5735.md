- Post Title: Star Trek: A Final Unity (PC) Sprite Rip Request

Greetings everybody!  I'm new to the board, and I am very excited to see if anyone here can help me with something I've been struggling with for YEARS.

I'm currently in the process of building a Star Trek TNG adventure game (in the spirit of old-style Sierra point-and-click adventure games like Kings Quest and Space Quest) and need some help ripping sprites out of an old-school PC game. (Star Trek: A Final Unity)

I have saved what I believe to be the sprite files here: [http://www.thesequelpolice.com/tng-SpriteFiles.zip](http://www.thesequelpolice.com/tng-SpriteFiles.zip)

If anyone can figure out how to pull out the individual frames, I would be forever indebted to you.

Thanks in advance for anyone who takes a stab at this!

Best,
Ian
