Hi , I have some troubles analyzing the league of legends ' audio file , that's SFX audio , and it's( .bnk) file format , when I unpack it, I find it consists of some (.wem ) files , so I know it's made by Wwise , so I use Wwise to make such soundbank,too. However , when I also make a .bnk file , and it also consists of .wem file ,but the problem is  :  the file name of .wem file in the .bnk file is not what I have named before , and I also dont know how the .wem file in the .bnk file is named.         I hope you can help me ,and tell me how I can make the name of the .wem file in the .bnk file to be what I have named before , in the software of  Wwise , Is there a setting for that?  and in the wwise soundbank , can I control the file name? I hope you can help me,thank you very much !
