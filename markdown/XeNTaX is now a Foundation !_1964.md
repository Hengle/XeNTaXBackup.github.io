Sounds good, that means you can't charge for MultiEx anymore though.

That system does not change. We need the donations to the MultiEx Commander project to ensure it's continuity. 

Users/Volunteers/Supporters can donate to different projects or to the general Xentax Foundation cause, that is up to them. The total funding will be spend on projects that need it. It is our aim to let people propose support for their projects, and if deemed priorty the Xentax Foundation will do just that.
