- Post Title: PSP Legends of war Pations campaign DATA.PAK tool.

How to:-This tool will extract the .png .at3 .pmf files (124 MB) from the DATA.PAK from "Legends of war Pations campaign" PSP

1.Extract the ripkit folder (with winrar) & put your DATA.PAK into the same folder(extracted with UmdGen) and run the extract_DATA.PAK.bat this will extract all the .png .at3 .pmf.
2.Then downsample but keep the same name,but if the files are bigger it will not be added.(to downsample read the tutorials)
3.Run the update_DATA.PAK.bat this will then inject the files back in!!(Put the new DATA.PAK back in using UmdGen or WQSG_UMD_R31)
4.When you cso your iso it will be smaller!!
5.Make a ripkit!!!!!

many thanks to Gnie and skybladecloud for the tools
