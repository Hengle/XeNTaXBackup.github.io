- Post Title: Official DPK4 Format Specification

I received this format specs quite a long time ago, and I thought I've lost it after the author removed it from his site. In any case, here it is.

(Actually, I think he made the specs for me in particular, after I was asking about the model format. It wasn't very useful for me at the time, considering I already made a fully functional packer/unpacker that took into account specific details of the format.)
