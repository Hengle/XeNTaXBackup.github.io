You know that file format that is described on that site belongs to ArmA and Operation Flashpoint? Are you sure that you have the same format in Hulk Ultimate (or what is the game you are researching)?
Nevertheless, on the same site there is an editing package called BI Tools, which contains Oxygen 2. That is a model editing and animation package, which reads the .p3d format (their format). So you can download BI Tools (25Mb) and try to read your .p3d model.

I did some research a while back on this format. It is heavily compressed but it is the same format that is used in prototype.

I was able to find this: [Link](http://pages.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/~parker/cpsc585-radical/the_site/example_documents/DarkAngel_ArtPipeline.pdf) which is basically a rundown of how they make the p3d files and the pipeline for the game engine (Hulk Ultimate Destruction & Prototype share the same engine).

Ya there isn't much information on the format. As a matter of fact thats all the information that we've got :\ All I know is that it's encrypted somehow and that it has a hash check so if you modify it your game wont work.
