- Post Title: How To Extract .Bundle Files?

Hi, I was wondering is there a way to extract .bundle files on windows? 

I have some .bundle files from a extracted mobile game (.obb) but I tried to get all of it's 3D models mostly have them all but I noticed some were missing and I found them in another folder but they are only available as a .bundle files that are named "character all assets" and I can't import them into any Unity extracting program because they are not .assets files.
