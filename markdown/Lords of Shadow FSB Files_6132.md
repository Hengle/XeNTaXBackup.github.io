they are "fake" fsb files, indeed the real FSB file is compressed.
maybe use offzip over them and then fsbext on the generated files and don't worry if some of them can't be extracted because there are not only FSB files (for example there are also ogg).

I will work on a new version of offzip that will add also the correct extensions to the generated files

really weird, they are mp3s because they start with the classical bits of the frames in use in this format (for example the bytes 0xff 0xfb) but the content is strange.
