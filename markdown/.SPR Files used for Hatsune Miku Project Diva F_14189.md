- Post Title: .SPR Files used for Hatsune Miku: Project Diva F

I am trying to extract 2d sprites from the game's .spr files. I've tried TextureFinder with no luck on a clear image.
Thanks if somebody can help

I also searched all forums but I didn't find anything related to this particular file format.

That's the best I could get out of TextureFinder:
