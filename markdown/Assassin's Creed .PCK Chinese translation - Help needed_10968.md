> We are the one of Chinese game dubbing groups. Although a non-profit organization, but we also have some professional voice actors here. We all love dubbing and our accents range from all across china's vast expanse. Once I met Assassin's Creed, I was absolutely riveted by the story of it. So special, so exquisite. What an amazing game! Exactly, I make a decision at once! Therefore, I organized a group of dubbing speicalist who love Assassin's Creed game highly. We decided to put the Assassin's Creed into Chinese dubbing! But I need some more help and support in addition to my friends, that’s why I write to you, to your group. Will you please give me some help? For that I am very grateful! God bless you and your group!

i can have a look but as i said AC1  was kind of stupid coz there is no texts, we went to try work on localization, but we could not. I can send you tools i have but not sure if that would be usefull for them coz repacker is not there and to make one would take weeks of work, which i dont have

I see there is text, in a Localization.lang kind of file. But Turfster never got round to making extract/replace possible for sound .forge files. Also, XForge does not replace. I do understand that text is encrypted.. .

There is only minumum of the text, like menu and so on, no dialogs. I can have a look on it, but im not sure if i would be able to do something about it, BTW That forge tool was not extracting data correctly, just information. Also need files from AC coz i dont have it.

This is also a rather valuable piece of information to start with

It was never my intention to replace/re-pack the forge files or provide a tool for any kind of localization.  Not sure if I have ever stated that publicly in the forums, but I have said that to everyone who has ever asked.

It has always been my intention to provide a visual way of extracting game assets (models, textures, etc.).  For that ForgeX and its successor Archive X does what it is intended to do.  And as soon as I can wrap my head around the way WPF works with multiple meshes, model viewing will be working in Archive X.

Back to the subject at hand.

I was able to find string files in Prince of Persia.  They were simple enough, not encrypted, easy to read.  I found the same file designation in Assassin's Creed, however, those files appear to be encrypted.  Everything about the header of the file was the same as Prince of Persia, except where the strings were to start nothing looked even relatively close to anything legible.  I was never able to figure out the encryption, so I shelved that section of the project until a later date when I had more time to dedicate to it.  Unfortunately, Ubisoft continues to make AC games.  So for the most part my time gets spent figuring out the small differences in the forge file each time a new game is released.

Thanks for reading,

MDA

MichaelDarkAngel, I merely stated that your tool did not allow rebuilding, just like Turfster's Animus also can't do it. The issue is: is it possible to rebuild the sound files with new sounds.

Apologies, if my last post read as if it was directed at anyone.  I didn't mean it that way.  I was merely stating what can and can't be done with my tool.

If re-packing can be done, it would probably be easier to do with the sound files as opposed to the art assets.  Not even sure what it would take to replace the art assets but a single texture can be found in multiple locations across multiple forge files.  So, in theory, the limited number of sound forge files may make the job somewhat easier.

Just my thoughts,
