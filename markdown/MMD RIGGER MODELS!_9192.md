So seriously like, whoever is doing this could you stop? Because it's me here. THE REAL LITTLEBJD. I would never do that and another thing is I was sick so that's not me. THE HELL IS WRONG WITH THIS TROLL.

(My friend made this acc. name for me so yeah..It was because I couldn't make accounts in here..)

Ohh and here, it's 10:32 PM from Philippines time. I only found out now what mess you did.

Again?
Are my models really that awesome? Just to tell you no they are not. They suck. Vert has like a million issues and the others are noob rigs so really to tell the truth I don't care. Plus it isn't something I made with Metaseq or any other 3D program all I did was add bones, physics and joints that was it. So really trolls get a grip on life and see how valuable these models really are and get a life. Especially since its over a whack of damned pixels.

:I If your expecting me to do anything more about this besides my thoughts your wrong I will just keep doing what I'm doing and you trolling me isn't going to stop me because who ever is doing this is being a immature brat who doesn't have a life and wants to troll over a whack of stupid pixels.

Yeah, the eyes aren't that great but the models do make for a good anime reference. I learned a lot from this game and from totori and meruru rips. Totori and meruru use very interesting anime facial morphs. They aren't animated textures but rather vertex morphs that distort the face texture.

However, I really regret releasing the mk2 ripper now  . I was going to go back to it and try to get the animations since the motion ISM2 files just store a list of time keyframes along with joint euler angles, but after all this stuff nah... forget it lol. I ain't working on the new game when it comes out either... somebody else will have to do it lol. I'm tired of working on these scene graph based formats; they are no fun.

 at the bottom of the information tags for each of my model uploads, but it seems that nobody else bothers to thank you for that...

Nah, I don't care what people do lol. I dont need or want any credit. I get a kick out of it  though sometimes and makes me lol. My main complaint is this...

Da user comes to xentax.
Extracts models.
Posts screencap of model on da.
Another user on da asks where they got model from.
They say they ripped it themselves.
Other user asks how can I get the models?
And their reply... you have to wait for another ripper! Wtf! Lol!

I do this to share with you guys... but some of these da children take the free cake and won't let anyone else eat it too hahaha. I mean come on...just tell people where you got access to the models from so they can have some fun too!

But for neptunia v I am expecting another scene graph format and it takes a month of work to map out nodes. Just don't have the time.

So I went to [look](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scene_graph) at what scene graphs are about

> The scene graph is a structure that arranges the logical and often (but not necessarily) spatial representation of a graphical scene. The definition of a scene graph is fuzzy because programmers who implement scene graphs in applications — and, in particular, the games industry — take the basic principles and adapt these to suit particular applications. This means there is no consensus as to what a scene graph should be.

We need more standards in the computing world. Maybe life would be easier for everyone.

the format is based off of sony's sdk that uses collada as a base.
so in a sense it is using a standard just a really annoying and complex one.

Yeah, for example, this is my [IGB parser](http://code.google.com/p/sticklove/source/browse/trunk/source/xentax/ripper/x_igb.cpp), which so far parses the entire tree, but doesn't yet parse the data section yet... that and the header file is already almost 5,000+ lines of C++ scene graph madness lol! The totori PSSG one was 6,000+ lines of code and I didn't even process all the nodes. I think Neptunia with its bugs was around 3,000 - 4,000 lines of code as well. Considering by software engineering standards 10 lines of code per day per worker... it's a lot of work.

I can see why that nifskope tool is some several million lines of code.

:X

But lol @ comments in that vid I linked.
The tools are freely available, so anyone can rig it

"I recognize the physics" LOL

I should start telling people that they copied my code cause only I make certain types of coding errors.
And type in a certain way. 

I should haiku in code, with a specific number of syllables per line.

To be fair, I've never actually rigged a model so I'm not sure if there are specific techniques that distinguish one's physics from anothers' physics.
For example, when an artist draws something, you can tell that it's likely by a specific artist because of certain techniques, styles, material used, etc.

Maybe in the world of 3D modeling, you can also establish certain rigging techniques that make it symbolic.

I need to start making my own brag list.
No one writes model parsers like I do! Always half-done!

I guess there are a lot of game reversers out there...whoever this RTB is lol

Rtb rerigged the neptunia models for the guys on facepunch. The mmd and deviant art people got a hold of these models and are fighting over ownership of them lol. "these are mines lol I recognize the physics hahahaha."

"these are mines lol I recognize the physics hahahaha."It's not really my rigging, it's mainly using the original rigging/weightmaps that your program exports with some fixes where necessary. But yeah, that is fairly annoying, and honestly the first time something like that happened for something I uploaded... Well, first time in a long while, that is.

Are some Neptunia fanboys really that crazy?

lol I was wondering why the acronym seemed familiar.

Damn I see some sengoku basara models.
I wonder if it's from one of the games or hand-made.

I couldn't figure out how to unpack the PS3 disc.

Not necessarily... the point of that comic wasn't to completely discourage the development of new standards, I think, but to make potential standards authors stop and think about what they're doing. There are definitely still areas where a standard would help.
