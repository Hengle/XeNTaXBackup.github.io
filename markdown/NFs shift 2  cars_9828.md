Hello! I tried to export some cars from nfs shift 2 using the bms script made for shift 1, but when i import the min zmodeler, it only export the wheels of the cars and a bunch a planes . Does anyone know any other bms script, or another way to export the cars from shift2 ?
I only need the BMW_M3_E30
