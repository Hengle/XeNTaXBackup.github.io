Took a look at the pak files from this and none of the pak file extractors could handle it.. Unrecognized format...

Loaded up ultraedit and looked at the first part of the pak file, this is what it included:

Sr
â€¡
PACKA


then a long list of dirs/filenames..

I can supply ftp for you to get the file from if need be, but the 2 pak files are HUGE !

panzers.pak 1.45G
panzers_de.pak 205MB

Anything else i can help out with let me know, really like to take a look inside these files.

thanks
