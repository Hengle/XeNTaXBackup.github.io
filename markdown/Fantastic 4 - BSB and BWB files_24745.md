- Post Title: Fantastic 4 - BSB and BWB files

We at MarvelMods are trying to get into the audio files of PC version of the 2005 Fantastic 4 game so that they can be repurposed for Marvel Ultimate Alliance 1 and X-Men Legends II modding.
But I can't find any info about the file types.
There are 2 types of audio files.
The .bsb files in a hex editor are a list of what's in the .bwb files but not every bwb file has a bsb file and even Dragon Unpacker couldn't do anything with these files. 
Does anyone have any idea how to get these files extracted?
Thanks to anyone willing to give this a shot.

So, if anyone cares, while I couldn't get into the PC's bsb and bwb files, the PS2 version has different files that can be opened in PSound. You'll get thousands of randomly named files and you'll need to double the speed on all of them, but it's a way to get to the audio, at least.
