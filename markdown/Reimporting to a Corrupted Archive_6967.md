- Post Title: Reimporting to a Corrupted Archive

I was wondering if it is possible to add a file to a corrupted archive.

I am working with a file from Team Fortress on the Xbox 360. With quickbms, I have found that the archive contains a folder called /cfg. I need to be able to ADD one file in there that has a max size of 1kb and is called "1.cfg" with modded settings.

Is there any way I could do this?
