i know this thread has been dead for over 6 months, which is a shame
because the animals in this game look gorgeous and would be great to have
in a common 3D format such as .fbx (if there's even bone support possible).

the request of the thread starter goes out to "Cabela's Dangerous Hunts 2013", right?

you can use this script for quickbms which can be found here.
source: [http://www.extractor.ru/ipb/index.php?showtopic=8588](http://www.extractor.ru/ipb/index.php?showtopic=8588)
to extract the conent of the game.

however, now that these files can be extracted, i'd like to know if there's
someone around here who might have a look into the mesh files.
for a possible import into 3DSMax, Blender, Noesis or C4D via script or plugin.
i know the most talented people are around here, so i try my luck.

here's a sample containing 4 animals from the game.

thanks for your time.

The .msh files in this game are exactly the same as the ones in Dangerous Hunts 2013 (PC version).
Here is a quickbms script to convert the .msh files into .3ds files with UVs (the UVs need to be scaled down ALOT, they will be so big that it will look like there are no UVs)

Use the script with the instructions I posted here:
