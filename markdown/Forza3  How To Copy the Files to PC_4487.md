- Post Title: Forza3  How To Copy the Files to PC

Hi,
I have the Forza3 Limited Edition with 2 Cd's and i want to copy the files ( car, wheels...) onto my pc but how ?
I read that you have to have a special cd driver ( the thing where you put in the cd on pc) (i don't know the right word for it:D)
Is there a possible solution?





If the thread is in the wrong topic, sry then,i don't know where to post it.
