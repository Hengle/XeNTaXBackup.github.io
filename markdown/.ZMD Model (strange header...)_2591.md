I don't understand the file but some of it is clear

the file seems to have more than just the box you rendered, it has 132 vertices total, and I believe some vertices are also at the top

string
{
	int32 NumChars
	char* string
}

at offset 639 is some sort of index, right before it is a int32 indicating the number of entries

index
{
	short index entry
}

then there is one vertex for each index entry(132)
the vertex structure is as described in the first string of the file

vertex size : 64 bytes - 8448 bytes total
then there is some more floats and the name of the texture, fiel then ends

the structure that the strings lay out seem to indicate some sort of hierarchy, like a graph and its sub nodes,, so maybe the floats at the beginning of the file are the transformation matrices or something, I don't know :(

Scene_Root
{
    _00
    {
        _Box
        {
            NULL // an empty node?
            {
            }
            _Box_Obj
            {
                *matrix index and all that stuff*
                *texture filename*
            }
        } // end of _Box
    } // end of _00
} // End of scene root
