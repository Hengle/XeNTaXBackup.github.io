hi there guys, im just new here.. i found this site hoping for tweaking NBA 2K12 PC version... theres a bit difference on xbox 360 version in comparison to PC... regarding graphics... it seems that on PC - Slef shadowing on players are not present.. like an ambient occlusion/shaders, etc.. i hope someone in here can help us PC users to atleast have the same graphic experience like on consoles..
