Hi !
I've been trying to extract voice files from the first Assassin's Creed using Dec Ubi snd, but it don't work. Files are incomplete, same things for other rippers. Does anyone have a solution ?

So I managed to extracted perfectly readable and complete audio files using Quickbms scripts scimitar.bms and assassins_creed_raw.bms (then just scan the .dat file with a file ripper), but it doesn't work for most of the forge files (for example Datapc_Acre.forge), and gives uncomplete audio files. How can I extract them properly and have the complete sound file. I'll let a sample of the .dat file obtained with Quickbms and an extension less bao file. If anyone can help, it'll be cool

Use foobar2000 + vgmstream plugin. Make sure that all BAO are in the same folder.
