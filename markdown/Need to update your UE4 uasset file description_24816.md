- Post Title: Need to update your UE4 uasset file description

With each new revision of UE4 (such as UE 4.26 instead of UE 4.25) there are changes to the structure of the uasset files. The structure you have documented in [http://wiki.xentax.com/index.php/Unreal_Engine_4_UASSET](http://wiki.xentax.com/index.php/Unreal_Engine_4_UASSET) is NOTHING like the latest revision of the UE4 uasset files. Somebody really needs to update it. I've attached a recent uasset file (actually it's a umap file, but their structures are the same, just that umap files are specifically used for defining terrain used in games).

Sure, I can update the article, but you would need to send me a file format description for this new version.

You can start reverse engineer it, because there are no other volounteers for that, I suppose.
