- Post Title: Compressed .RAW file

I'm trying to translate a PS2 Japanese game (Bleach: Blade Battlers 2). After failing to find any file which could be a dialogue script, I've decided to take a look at the textures. i've managed to extract the CFC.DIG file using a QuickBMS script... but the .RAW files seem to be compressed.. does anyone could help me with that? it looks like .CSS files from Dot Hack.. that contains texture, animation and models in the same file.

.Raw file sample: [https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B1E6h ... 0lUbHByQ0U](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B1E6hxvkD7n0NFU4Z0lUbHByQ0U)
