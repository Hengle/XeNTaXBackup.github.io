- Post Title: Kingdom Hearts BBS - Save Editor v0.4 [All Regions + FM]

Hi,

here's a GUI save editor for all Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep games
it's based on the Save Edit Enabler ([http://www.mediafire.com/?w04hmve8mnc565l](http://www.mediafire.com/?w04hmve8mnc565l)) tool I made



To use it you have to use Savegame Deemer [http://psp.dashhacks.com/downloads/savegame-deemer-v111](http://psp.dashhacks.com/downloads/savegame-deemer-v111), the savefiles being the SDDATA.BIN files

(src included, GPL v3)

Changelog :  [http://pastebin.com/f0ywuDqV](http://pastebin.com/f0ywuDqV)

How to Use : 
- First download the [Savegame Deemer](http://psp.dashhacks.com/downloads/savegame-deemer-v111) plugin, enable it and use it to obtain your decrypted savefiles
- Then in the SAVEPLAIN folder that appeared, you only have to locate in which save folder is the save you wanna edit (for example your first save slot is ULJM057750000, your second ULJM057750001, etc ...)
- So launch the program, click on the "Open" button, go to your save folder and select the SDDATA.BIN file you see inside.
- Now you can change everything you want, click "Save" when you're finished. You're done !
- Now just start the game with Savegame Deemer enabled and load from the save you edited, enjoy 

+ be aware that US / EUR savefiles are completely identical, you can freely swap their .BIN files as you like
