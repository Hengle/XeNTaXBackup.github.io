- Post Title: Collada .DAE open and convert

How I hate this format.

I have a model from the game Godzilla PS4 2015. Model in .dae format.

I do not know how to open it, Blender, FBX Converter, 3DS Max, all these programs give an error.
There is also an option to edit .dae through XML, but when I open .dae in NotePad++, strange hieroglyphs open up for me.

When the computer is free, I'll drop the archive with the models.

They're not Collada .dae.  They're PhyreEngine game files.  They're binary files with reversed 'RYHP' magic header.  PHYR = PhyreEngine.

You can use hex2obj to display the mesh:

Don't have the time to get the joints (in pl06_mechagidra.dae for example) atm, sorry.
