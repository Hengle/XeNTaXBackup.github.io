- Post Title: WWE All-Stars Unlock ALL Code!!!

Wasn't really sure where to post this info, but this may come in handy for people that actually like this game, and want to unlock everything easily.

To Unlock Everything, on the main menu, enter this button combination:

Left, Y, Down, Left, Y, X, Left, X, Y, Down, Right, X, Left, Up, X, Right

You're Welcome.
