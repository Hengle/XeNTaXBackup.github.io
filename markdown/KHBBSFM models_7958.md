I'm looking for pmo files that are from Birth by Sleep Final Mix. From what I've read, it seems like the only way to get them is from a process where the PSP is connected to the computer at one point. I am unable to due this. Would anyone be able to point me in the right direction on how to get these files, or better yet, does anybody have these files for download? Any help would be appreciated.

I've looked for the files, but I can't find any pmo files. The only person I know of that has been able to get the files is Zerox.

Then extract it from the archive using some tool that they use.

What archive? What tool? Your answers are a bit vague.
I've tried extracting all the iso and dat files I could find, but nothing I have done has produced any pmo files of models from BBSFM

I don't remember what tools I used when I was looking at them, but I got them from that thread (or at least the names anyways) and was dumping files out of BBS#.dat as several members have mentioned.

Have you looked through the entire thread?

I've looked through the entire thread and used all the tools I could that they had and still could not get the pmo files I wanted.
