- Post Title: Split/Second - Can't open .MODEL files

Hello,

just as the topic says im unable to open .model files from game split second made by black rock studios. I tried looking into hex code of the file however i wasn't able to find anything that would help me with understanding how to open that file. I tried importing it to 3ds, TransMagic and Blender however every time im getting an error.

I was able to rip the model by using 3dripper/ninjaripper but these programs are not allowing me to check the scale of original model and they are not allowing to reimport those files.

I would be extremely happy if anyone could tell me how to open these files.

Here is the link on google drive to that file:

Import the rip into 3ds Max, check "convert" in the "Units/Scale" box and select meters to get accurate scaling.
