GFD is file storing character definitions and probably coordinates.
TEX is compressed texture file.

After converting TEX to DDS you can view them with IrfanView [https://imgur.com/a/eZuV8mI](https://imgur.com/a/eZuV8mI)
and edit with GIMP + DDS Plugin.

Thanks for reply
I Know how to edit and recreate Tex file
But my problem is I need to add like 100 new char to game font, so I can't just replace some existing char with new one, I need to create new font, i found some useful information about gfd file in this site [https://sigyn.tistory.com/6](https://sigyn.tistory.com/6) - [with google translate to english](https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&tab=wT0&sl=auto&tl=en&u=https%3A%2F%2Fsigyn.tistory.com%2F6). its explain gfd file format

Character  (red box)
Character position (green box)
Character size (blue box)
Offset-character size deviation (orange box)


 but becuse i dont have much experiment with these stuff, i cant create a tool by myself
i think its possible to create a new bitmap font with BMFont, then somehow convert BMfont char mapping (xml file) to GFD but i dont know how
can anyone help?
thanks
