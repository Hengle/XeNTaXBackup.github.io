- Post Title: Assassin's Creed II (Fonts)

Hello to all forum members. I have one question. I translated the text into AC2 (AC2 Delux Edition). 
But the English version does not support Cyrillic. 
Who can help me to edit the font, or tell me how to do it myself. 
I would be glad for any help. Thank you for attention.

Are you using the Kramla scripts?
Those scripts extract the entire packpage, so the font stuff should be in extracted files.

Maybe I'm using Kramla scripts as I personally do not know it.
And he did not give me any tools. And definitely it's his scripts.
The script only unpacks the archives and everything.... But the textures themselves are not. 
Maybe you remember exactly where the font is located? In what archive...

Textures should have a custom format or extension, I don't remember, it was a many years ago...
There's any file with a suggestive name?
Post a printscreen of the extracted folder.

I understand you perfectly. Translation of the AC 2 you have done a long time ago.
I unpacked only DataPC.forge Fonts are definitely in another archive. Thank delutto for your willingness to help.

What tool did you use ? I'd like to try if it works also with Black Flag.

Fonts are in DataPC_extra.forge.
For the video subtitles, use BinkMod.
