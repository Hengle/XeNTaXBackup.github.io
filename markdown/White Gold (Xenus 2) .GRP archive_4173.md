Hi all!
I know there is an unpacker to Codename: Outbrake, someone made it, thats Vital Engine too. To Boiling Point there is too, (offical sdk) but for Xenus 2 (White Gold) there is no any extractor... And I have a contact with the developers, and they told me, they won't be release offical SDK... So I think maybe somebody could make an extractor program for this file format. I think the whole Xenus 2 community will thank it, like just me! 

Its the Vital Engine 3, and here is the vital.dll:

I was thinking the same but I doubt that Deep Shadows games has anything with Hax.

Edit : You are right pixellegolas, seems Roman Lut (Hax) is the guy behind that game.

I already asked Hax, but he answered this:

So I think we can't expect to any support from them.

Deep Shadows won't be help.
Somebody can make this extractor?
