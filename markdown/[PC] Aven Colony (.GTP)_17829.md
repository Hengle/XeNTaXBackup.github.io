Hello

Is there any software that can extract (repack if possible) gtp files?
The files are in a folder called "...\GraniteSDK\ImportedTileSets\Characters_E92A89EE4A307104879D3C9C872238E9", I do not know if it helps. I tried to search on the internet for information about granite or sdk but without success.

I hope someone will do something. Thank you in advance
