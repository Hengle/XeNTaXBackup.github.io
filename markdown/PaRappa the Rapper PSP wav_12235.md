- Post Title: PaRappa the Rapper PSP wav

This game's got a bunch of .wav files, which are all the vocals tracks of the raps in the game. 
They can be played with ffplay however they are broken up with equal spaces in between each break up, it's not just a single vocal track.

Could someone take a look at these and help me out a little?
