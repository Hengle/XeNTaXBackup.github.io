- Post Title: Are you afraid of the dark The tale of orpheo's curse *.UMV

Hello Im currently looking at the game in the title and attempting to document the files and formats
I have documented as much as I am currently able to. this can be found here
[http://gracesdisposal.bpweb.net/AFRAID/](http://gracesdisposal.bpweb.net/AFRAID/)

Im currently looking at the movie and animation resource files. These files are *.UMV files and I have been unable to find any documentation on this particular format. 

The game itself was based upon a hit nickelodeon kids show from the nineties and was produced by Viacom's game division

I have uploaded some sample UMV files here some from the ANIMS directory and some from the MOVIES directory
they all appear to be the same format.

Any help on this would be greatly appreciated.

This would be a question preferably posted in the Graphics section.

Sorry I did spend a while debating which section to place it in, any chance it can be moved? I dont see the point in clogging the forum up with duplicate posts

Thanks 
Rob
