I'll appreciate any help or guidance to unpack the "objects.dat" archive from "Samantha Swift and the Hidden Roses of Athena". 
The head.bin and tail.bin may be downloaded here: [http://motionpress.com/uploads/Samantha ... d_tail.rar](http://motionpress.com/uploads/Samantha_Swift__head_and_tail.rar)

Thanks in advance!
