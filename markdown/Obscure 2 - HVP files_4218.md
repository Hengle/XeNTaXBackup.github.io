- Post Title: Obscure 2 - HVP files

I unpacked the HVP file, but contain only DAT files. That's no problem. But, all DAT are compressed with some kind of LZO or LZ77, I don't really know.

Knows somebody what compression use the file?

Any chance you can share your method or tools to unpack the .hvp and uncompress the .dat files.

Thanks

Dat files:
Maybe, but I can't repack. I mean I can, but the repacked file is not equal with the original file, just the size, so it's doesn't work. So it's useless now.
I downloaded the official Russian version, and if I replace an eng file to rus, the game also doesn't work. I think the game contain somewhere filesize data or something. I'll compare the 2 language game version to see what changed, I hope this will the key.

To hvp: Xpert2
alucard.cc (free reg, recommend), or Google

I remember this trying to hack and i got the same problkem than you, if you unpack the data the game crashes..what i did it's:
-Unpack (decompress) the data (i found a russian tool)
-Then pack the uncompressed data in compression 0
Game still crashing

-I split the first 30mb's of the header and attached to the packed data with compression 0 with the silly command 
```
copy /b header + compression0 datafinal
```


Maybe i'm wrong it was time ago..but i remember this, decompress, pack with compression 0 and attach a big header (compressed) from the original.

I know sounds strange..but it worked

I'll give a try. But if I recompress the data with compression 0, the size of the files will changes, and than the header contain the wrong offset/size values. Or am I wrong?!

Do you remember who made this russian tool? CHEATER maybe?
Or do you have a link or something to this tool?
Because as I saw, the Xpert2 tool can unpack (not decompress) the data, but if I repack the hvp, this mess up the header.

Hello,
How can I extract the Obscure II .hvp file?
I tried using the tools "obscure.hvptool" and "unhvp" but it didn't work.
I'm dubbing the game to my language and I want to extract the video and audio files.
Thanks.

- Post Title: Re: Obscure 2 - HVP files

I have some good news for Obscure 2 fans. 

I've spent some time researching HVP archives and now it's clear to me what type of hash function was used to store filenames.
It turns out it was just regular CRC32.

File format is available on the wiki here [http://wiki.xentax.com/index.php/Obscure_2_HVP](http://wiki.xentax.com/index.php/Obscure_2_HVP)
with all the notes/comments that should be useful for further research.
My focus was mainly on PC version of the game, but afaik PSP/PS2/WII versions uses the same file format.

I was able to correctly guess 80-90% of all hashes for PC release.
Here are the current results:

```
kinepack.hvp --> 89.29%
loadpack.hvp --> 84.32%
datapack.hvp --> 91.37%

```


Some of the hashes are identical or similar in PS2/PSP release, so you can use it as a starting point in further research.

To make a good use of filenames, I've created a HVP extractor (and some other tools as well)
All of them are available here: 
[https://github.com/bartlomiejduda/Tools ... bsCure%202](https://github.com/bartlomiejduda/Tools/tree/master/NEW%20Tools/ObsCure%202)

Usage is explained in the readme file.

It is possible to get 100% of the correct hashes, but it requires a lot of time.
If you want to help, you can send me a PM with correct filenames and I will add them to the tool.

Here is a tutorial with explanation how to do it:
[https://ikskoks.pl/tutorial-how-to-rest ... -archives/](https://ikskoks.pl/tutorial-how-to-restore-hashed-filenames-from-archives/)

Also, game is able to read files outside of the archives, but I didn't figure out how to do it yet. 
(even with the files unpacked in the correct directory, game preferred to load files from HVP archives)

If you know how to help with that, please let me know.


By the way, if you are interested in my "Obscure 1" research as well, here are the links:

> Just found my old research stuff, might be useful

Thank you, I have compared your logs with my filenames list and there is some progress:

```
loadpack  --> from  84.32% to 85.97%
datapack --> from 91.37% to 94.2%
```

Here is a commit with new filenames [https://github.com/bartlomiejduda/Tools ... 9934073e86](https://github.com/bartlomiejduda/Tools/commit/3c89e49c695e4eef9d7ecba851df3f9934073e86)

as for PACK_EN.hvp and STRMPACK.hvp, in my version of the game (PC version) those files comes already unpacked, 
so I should have 100% of names for both of them, but to be sure I need to do some testing.
If someone could upload those archives, I would be able to test it.

STRMPACK is missing 3 files and these filenames are in french encoding. You can check soundfx.xmc or streams.xmc files to get them, I don't remember which one 

PS: PACK_EN.hvp and STRMPACK.hvp present in Russian version from 1C Company. You can download torrent here <link deleted by moderator> if you need it

Ok, thanks, in the newest commit I was able to get those missing french names
[https://github.com/bartlomiejduda/Tools ... 40da9c5900](https://github.com/bartlomiejduda/Tools/commit/bc411cd78e0c62c40e748972c483fd40da9c5900)
(I had encoding issue in my tool... but now it's fixed)

So I can confirm that we have 100% names for STRMPACK.hvp (for PC release)
and 22.22% for PACK_EN.hvp (for PC release)
