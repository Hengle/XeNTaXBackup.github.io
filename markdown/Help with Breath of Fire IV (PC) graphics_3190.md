- Post Title: Help with "Breath of Fire IV (PC)" graphics

I'm starting a tiny program to extract files from Breath of Fire III (PSX) & IV (PC and PSX):
- texts (PC, PSX)
- sound & music (WAV & MP3 for PC, VB+VH & SEP for PSX)
- fonts (PC)
- graphics (PC, PSX)
but i dont know the graphic format of the PC version.

[This file](http://rapidshare.com/files/156867605/BoF4.rar.html) (1.59MB) includes:
BoF4-PS\ -> some files extracted from BoF4 PSX
- *.pal - palette files (512bytes, R5G5B5)
- *.raw - raw graphic files (48KB, 8bpp)
- *.bmp - the final result (size 256x192, 256 colors)
BoF4-PC\ -> same files from BoF4 PC
- *.pal - same as PSX version
- *.gfx - unknow format

I think that the result must be the same as the PSX version but i'm not capable of decode it.
Can someone help me?

Thx in advance

A bunch of us have been trying the PC format against the PSX one for ages now but weve come to the conclusion that they're different but weve never figured out exactly why as were all working on other stuff on the sides.
Anychance you would be able to post the TOOL so far that you managed to crack the PSX version with?
Also...are the imaegs on the PSX REALLY that tiny...as i usd to play that game on a normal sized (well normal back then) tv and the images were clear so i cant imagine the images are really all that small.

I no need a gui, sorry.

The new file is attached. Now you can extract all text files in a readable format (PC/PSX versions, BoF3/BoF4 games). I converted all control codes & non-printable chars (not 100% sure, i need more checks). The INSERT mode isnt finished yet.

Hi, CUE, you finished your tool? Insert mode already works?
