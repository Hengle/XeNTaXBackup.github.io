The vertexes are stored as signed16byte integers, There is also a face index when I tried to view it after using some microsoft excel formulas the vertexes appearead fine, but when I added a face list the faces do not align properly. Here is a picture, I will do more work on this later this week.

great thanks; 

almost gave up on this

dunno if you still plan to continue on this;
but I would appreciate it very much if you could share with me what you have found so I can continue working with it

Edit: got 2 coords of the vertices (side view of the model is correctly) but the 3rd is still a mess

It is a part of python script in blender.

for i in range(numverts):
        xyz = struct.unpack(3*'h',plik.read(6))
        v1 = xyz[0]*2**-12
        v2 = xyz[1]*2**-12
        v3 = xyz[2]*2**-12        
        vertexy.append([v1,-v2,v3])
        uv = struct.unpack(3*'H',plik.read(6))
        u = uv[1]*2**-10 #???
        v = uv[2]*2**-10 #???
        uvcoord.append([u,v])
        plik.read(28)

numfaces = struct.unpack('i',plik.read(4))[0]
print struct.unpack('i',plik.read(4))

for i in range(numfaces/3):
         f= struct.unpack('HHH',plik.read(3*2))
         faceslist.append([f[0],f[1],f[2]])

Thats great can you tell me how to use this script in blender , if for example I have 3 files, one with the 32bitVertexes, one with the UV, and one with the Face index. Where would I insert the number of vertexes into the script?

i hope you can modify this script to import other models as well.
if not generally possible could you please post instructions on how to modify the script for other models

Thanks for reply.
Blender import materials and textures but they are not joint with objects,
because i have problem with UV coord for meshes.
To see textures:
1. in 3d view select object
2. in buttons window select material button and click on existing materials.

thanks again! now it works.

if i see it correctly, the converted mesh originaly consisted out of several different meshes and also out of different textures (3 in the case of corp_samson_01_closeddoor.xbg). could it be, that the textures should only be applied to the individual meshes? i hope this is a solvable problem.

In the case, that this is not scriptable but still only a problem of texturescaling, is there a practical way to correct this by hand? I tried to tweak "sizeX" and "sizeY" by hand 0.10 each every step but havn't found anything good looking between 0.00 and 5.00
Is there a script that can run through this, where you can press stop if you think it looks correct? other question: is the ration between scaleX and scaleY 1:1 at all?

i made a screenshot with activated "shadeless" option to see the texture better.

I see someone has beat me to it.    The problem with the way I was doing it, was that my Excel formulas used were off by an offset.

it would be so cool to have correct textures.

To begin I  would like to thank for the tool. The problem with multi-uv mapping is very annoying.
I'd like to know if it's possible to import skeleton and animation too.
sorry for my english ^^

maxnuke, how did you manage to get the uvmap being correctly assigned to the model?

If I import the Thanator model with the script, then the UVMap is not correct :/

what version of quickbms are you using? please download the latest version, mesh/anim/tex files are located on data.pak
and take note that the script only works for pc and 360 pak files

Sorry for the late reply. The UVmap was not imported correctly: I repair it manually, but I don't know how to do with multi-uvmap. I use maya.

Sorry for bumping,

is anyone still working on the Blender script or has work been abandoned? Would be sad, because now there are finally proper working unpack and re-pack tools, only either Blender or Maxscripts are missing, so that we can import the models, maybe modify them, MAYBE!? re-export them and implement them into Avatar.

I hope anyone is still up to work on the Blender script or even on a Maxscript.

I've made a small patch:

```

		g.seek(x+16)
		mesh=Mesh()
```


but as you can see there's the next hurdle in PMCU chunk. Don't have the time to fix this so you might wait for the author.

Problem is that vertex stride is 32 for the first submesh; script is very hard to debug for me.

Is there a way to get mesh from this file?

Using hex2obj (view link in my sig) you need to load the xbg, enter the parameters from the picture in my previous post then File/SaveAs mesh and you're done.

You can also copy the following lines into a text file, rename it to whatever.H2O and load it with File/Open H2O :

0x406D4 22899
Vb1
40 12
0x9E40 5425
020400
0x0 255

I've attempted to use both the blender script and hex2obj with no luck. the blender script is having difficulty finding newGameLib, even when the folder is in the same directory. Someone who's done this before, how did you get it to work? Hex2Obj was a bit too technical for me, I loaded the .H2O file and tried a .xbg file, but it said something about the vertex count. I'm looking for anything that'll work here.

How would I use the files provided? I've tried to install the Avatar.py addon to my Blender but it won't work. Also is there a safe download of the game so I can rip what I want from the game's files?
