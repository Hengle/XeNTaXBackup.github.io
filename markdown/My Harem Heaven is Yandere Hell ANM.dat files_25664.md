- Post Title: "My Harem Heaven is Yandere Hell" ANM.dat files

title aside, this game seems to generally use the "CASN" archive format, it's a ps3 Nippon Ichi game and that's what the header seems to be for the dat files

ANM.dat seems to contain 105 smaller anmXXXXX.dat files (x's being numbers), and instead of having a CASN header, they just have no header
i've tried out a bunch of tools and scripts meant to unpack other nippon ichi games but it seems like most of them are for other formats
it's possible that these arent archives, but that wouldn't explain their unusually high sizes, and since it's a visual novel it doesn't make sense for it to be anything other than character sprites
there aren't any other dat files with a high file size, movie.dat is just an encrypted fmv, DATA.dat only has background images and event CGs, and the three dat files in the sound folder just have audio files

[i've uploaded one of the anm dat files if anyone would like to help](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/818006237320052737/1004079139571122277/anm00020.dat), thanks in advance!
