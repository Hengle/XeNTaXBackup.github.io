- Post Title: MARIO + RABBIDS SPARKS OF HOPE (sdfdata )

Im just checking in to see if anyone found a way to rip dump content from sparks of hope yet? In the search i see it was mentioned but unsuccessful and i was wondering if by now any progress was made to the ubisoft_sdf.bms script? i see some models online from the game and was trying to see if they are fake.

im running into this error


Error: incomplete input file -1:
       Can't read 3 bytes from offset 00851b0b.
       Anyway don't worry, it's possible that the BMS script has been written
       to exit in this way if it's reached the end of the archive so check it
       or contact its author or verify that all the files have been extracted.
       Please check the following coverage information to know if it's ok.

  coverage file -1  100%!  9857837    8723211    . offset 00851b0b

Last script line before the error or that produced the error:
  99  get fileId long MEMORY_FILE
  coverage file 0   100%!  7241104    3742661    . offset 00000010
  coverage file -1  100%!  9857837    8723211    . offset 00851b0b


and with a modified script i found from someone i get this error
