- Post Title: Metal Gear REX from MGS4/MGSurvive

Hello, I was trying to rip the Metal Gear Rex model from Metal Gear Survive (I see is the same model from MGS4). I unpacked the .dat files with GzsTool.v0.6.0 but I can't find the .fmdl files of the models to open with Fmdl Studio v2. Any help to getting this done? Thank you!

Do you have the dlc it comes from?
Sorry, this sounds like a silly question, but it happens fairly often.

Nope, so I guess this models comes only in the DLC...Ehm so any chance to rip the model from MGS4 for PS3? Didn't find a lot for it, only Fox Engine stuff...

Edit: I managed to extract some stuff from PS3 .dat files but I have no clue where to find the rex model and how to open it...
