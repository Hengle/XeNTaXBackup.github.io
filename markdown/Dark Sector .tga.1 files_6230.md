- Post Title: Dark Sector .tga.1 files

Attached below are some files of the game: Dark Sector. 
It seems to be the font files. I've tried to rename them,
but doesn't works, and in hex editor, i've fixed the header
but doesn't works too. I think is a modified .tga file, but 
i'n not sure. Can anyone help?

The files are attached below.

Thanks in advance...
