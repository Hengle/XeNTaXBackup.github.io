Hi!

Ok, it's time for noob question - I can see a lot of bms scripts for unpacking X360 files, but my question is how can I get those files - do I need to have some sort of connector console-pc? I ask my friend to put x360 game into PC dvd and there was viedeo and aduio folders only (I don't have working dvd right now so I'm not able to check it myself).

I tried to find answer on forum but no effect..

Thanks in advance for help

Theres stuff like Xbox360 iso extract and Xbox backup creator.
I'd recommend backup creator one because it lets you pick which file you want to extract. iso extract one takes out all files and most of the time you wont need them all, also might take longer. :3

I always use PowerISO to get the iso off the disc, then use Xbox 360 ISO EXTRACT which extracts the files from the iso

I'm trying to do some trial and error stuff to learn how to do this, and I'm clearly missing something.  I've been messing around with Exiso and PowerISO, but that still isn't doing anything for me beyond access files viewable to Windows.  Could someone point me in the right direction in terms of tutorial or the obvious fact I'm missing?

Noesis does the job automatically, just pick up the file from you window browser.

Well remommaned you to use Xbox Backup Creator latest version, because old one does not supprot XD3 games, such as Skyrim, etc.... All others are pretty much usless, i did not try latest Exiso, but it could also work well. I dont know what is PowerISO for, but surelly does no work with X360 format!

PowerISO is a generic disk ripping tool; if your disk drive can read a disk, PowerISO can rip it, irrespective of the disk's format.

Only proper tool to rip, read X360 games is Xbox Backup Creator for sure. Special if we talking about XD3 g.

Thanks for everyone jumping in.  I think the quoted facts are the ones I was missing, so is Benq a hardware or software solution?  I'm trying to assess if I can do this with minimal hardware changes, since I haven't done hardware mods in almost a decade for a console and would prefer not to mess with my PC either (if possible).

You need Benq DVD drive from X360 and flash it with modded firmware what is call 0800. There is no any other method how to dump X360 dvd's! And i bet it wont ever be. I'm doing this for almost 7 years, so trust me, there is not other way. And of course you need Xbox Backup Creator latest with XD3 game support. However x360 scene is on the crossroad right now...

The #1 easy way to extract xbox games.
buy a usb thumb drive that is atleast 8gb
format it as an xbox memory card
install the game onto that drive from the xbox
plug it into the pc
use [http://digiex.net/downloads/download-ce ... lorer.html](http://digiex.net/downloads/download-center-2-0/xbox-360-content/apps-pc/4098-best-version-xtaf-explorer.html)
to copy the files off your usb stick
then use [http://digiex.net/downloads/download-ce ... erter.html](http://digiex.net/downloads/download-center-2-0/xbox-360-content/apps-pc/7115-god2iso-xbox-360-games-demand-iso-converter.html)
to convert it to an xbox iso
then you can extract the xbox iso with any program that supports it.

Brilliant! Thanks chrrox. That was the kind of methodology I was looking for.  Will try that later.

Did u actually tested ? I'm not sure if this is even possible. 

EDIT: This wont fork for normal flased driver!! Reguire JTAG xbox.... I was talking about proper ISO format, where you can burn and play it on normal not modded X360 with modded OOD only.

JTAG is completely different story

If I'm still able to get the data that's fine.  I'm not looking to play it, just extract the data for modding.

Even easier (if you have a spare DVD drive): hotswapping
Tried it myself and it works flawlessly (if you only want the gamedata and not the secured sectors, which aren't needed, except for pirating the game)

[http://gael360.free.fr](http://gael360.free.fr) (probably Win XP only)
wx360: after hotswapping select the drive and a folder to extract to (may take some time and the DVD drive will sound strange at times)
Important! Only remove the DVD after it stopped spinning for some (>2) minutes, the progress inside the program seems to be flawed.

well, GoD and installed games on HDD look exactly the same, except that GoD have the additional file that identifies the owner.

Success!  

Finally got a successful extract.  It required 3 parts.  I used the USB method & god2iso that chrrox mentioned and then the Xbox ISO extract that TRDaz listed.  I'm on Windows 7, so the Xbox Backup Viewer didn't work for me.  

Thank you everyone for the help.  I'll probably have technical question's on data stuff soon,
