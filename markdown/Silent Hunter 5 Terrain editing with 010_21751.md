- Post Title: Silent Hunter 5 Terrain editing with 010

Although not many may be interested in SH5, the Scripts I have written may help others.
I'm better known for my work on the GR2 file formats under the name Privateer.
I was asked to look at some terrain files using the .raw extension. After some conversations and help from the original Devs?
I was able to write a few scripts for 010 that take the raw files, convert them to an obj format for editing, then re-convert to the raw as SH5 needs them.
This thread is intended as an example of thinking outside of the box and using a VERY high power bit of Software to achieve a goal.
I hope it will help others as I report the information and post the Scripts.

Here is an example file.

I'll give you all a few days to see if you can figure it out.
