Hi all! I really need your help. I am very sorry if I posted in the wrong section, but I really want to learn how to do this.

I am wondering, how I can extract these 3d model files from this chinese game Onmyoji Arena 5v5 Moba game. I have tried all the things that I can do as far as my knowledge goes.
Onmyoji Arena 5v5 MOBA

Sample Model I want to extract: Yoto hime and all her other skins.


I already tried the Ninja ripper + Nox method, but this is the result...

Yes you are in the wrong section. This'is not the place for model requests. Please post in the 3D/2D models section.

That's what that section does. Here, instead, is a place for sharing knowledge if you've figured out how to solve a specified problem. 
Otherwise, "read" what other people already wrote here.

However, unfortunately you picked a not-so-easy case to start with. The archives from this game is compressed btw.
You can't do nothing before solving the compression.
