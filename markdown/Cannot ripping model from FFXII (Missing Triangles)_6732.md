- Post Title: Cannot ripping model from FFXII (Missing Triangles)

I try to open model FFXII by ModelViewerWXD3D9_0.3.
First i rip model by 3D Ripper DX and i get the model like this :


Second i try to use Game Assassin , but GA only support plugin for 3DSMax 2011 ( iam using 2010),so i cannot take the model from GA, and i used 3D Ripper DX again to rip model from 3D View of GA, and i get the same result.

Someone know other way to rip model from FFXII, please help me ! I just need model, no need animation or bone

those black areas are just flipped polygons, all you need to do is to flip normals on them... i think

right click -> flip normal mode and then click on the black triangles (it should work)

Anyway could you post the procedure and the tool for extracting ff12 models (starting from the iso)?

I had some problems and viewer didn't show me the models correctly..

Has anyone consistently exported ff12 models?  As far as I've seen, they all have either the black triangle problem, or have multiples of the same layers.
3DReaperDX appears to be flakey and yeilds the splotchy black triangle mess.
