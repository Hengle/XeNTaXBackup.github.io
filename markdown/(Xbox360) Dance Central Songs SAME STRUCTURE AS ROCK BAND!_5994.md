- Post Title: (Xbox360) Dance Central Songs: SAME STRUCTURE AS ROCK BAND!

Hi,
looking at work made by mahoppiangoon for rockband content:

[http://sites.google.com/site/mahoppiangoon/](http://sites.google.com/site/mahoppiangoon/)

I would like to deassemble and create custom songs also for Kinect Dance Central that is much similar to rockband standard...
I cannot open the .mogg file is quite similar to a new encrypted method...
the midi chart is similar, the subfolder "gen" instead contains other 2 files i havent' understood the utility of...

Here an example:

megaupload: ?d=7IT9RQ6L

you can extract them with wxpirs.exe

Can anyone please help me?

I really would like to create new dlc songs for this title...encouraging others to do the same for using with JTAG boxes!

Thanx in advance!

So any luck syncing this? 5 years later and I'm trying to do the same thing you did.
How are the animations triggered? MIDI notes? I can probably make a tool to assist in syncing charts.

I can't get the Milo_Xbox files opened and extracted? Can't find a tool for it.
