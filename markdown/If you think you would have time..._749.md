- Post Title: If you think you would have time...

Hey Mouse, I know you've posted that this is just a hobby for you, and it is one which I and everyone else here appreciate the results of - but I was wondering if you think you might be able to zero in on how to decompress the bin / cue / iso files ( whatever they are ) on the PK cd's that hold all the master files used / copied during install.
Maybe there are files in those which would make the editor much more usable, but just aren't being copied during install ?
I did try opening them with ISO Buster, but to no avail, of course.

There's no reason why I would not try to help out. Yet, I do not have the game, so I do not have access to the files you describe.

Can it be uploaded here ?
Realizing, of course, that it is over 600 MB in size.

Unfortunately, no. That would be too big a file.

Well, I don't know how much help this will be, but here are the first few bytes

Yes, but I'd prefer that in a file, not pasted here. If you could upload a snippet (up to 1mb is ok)?

Hmm, the piece is too small to be able to figure anything out.

Hmm, the file obviously has a lot of bytes of 32 (spaces). I have no idea how this works. And why they "fill" up these files with spaces.

I was afraid of that, it must be yet another proprietary thing, though I was hoping that the " ESIVmrg " would give the greatest clue as to what format this is.

Yeah, that certainly is an ID-tag of some program, but I have not yet found what ESVI stands for. mgr probably stands for manager.

My main CD has a setup.exe and the other 2 have something like painkiller.002 and painkiller.003.  The setup.exe on the first disk takes up the whole disk as do the 002 and 003 files.

My copy is probably different than the retail store copy.

Not really, I have the retail version and it's the same files on the 3 CD's as you listed on yours.
