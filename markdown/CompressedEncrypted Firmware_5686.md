- Post Title: Compressed/Encrypted Firmware

This is a dump from a nand chip in a <a href="[http://www.vtechkids.com/product.cfm/V. ... 38/">Vtech](http://www.vtechkids.com/product.cfm/V.Reader_Interactive_E-Reading_System/1838/%22%3EVtech) V.Reader ebook reader/game player for children.</a>

I've been told it's either compressed or encrypted and that this forum would be a good place to find help with it. (#win32asm@efnet)

My goal is to eventually be able to write my own games for the V.Reader, or at least figrure out what can and can't be done with it. (Install linux, load custom software, etc)

I've attached two files, the VTECHDUMP is the NAND dump file, and a zip file of what happened when I mounted the nand dump to be accessed as a file system.

Thanks for any help you can give me here.

there is nothing in the files you posted most are empty or filled with the same number repeating.

My apologies, I'm a fucking idiot. 

Uploaded the wrong file.

On a 14.4kbps right now and it's 66mb.

No goskies tonight.
