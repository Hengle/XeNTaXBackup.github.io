- Post Title: Cars Video Game 3D Models?

So I managed to get the textures from the Cars video game (PC) converted...now I need models.

Except, I can't really tell what file is supposed to be the model...I think it might be one of the files in the "ANIM" folder....I did see a few files and I think it might be the .DXG files...so have the zip of McQueen: [https://www.mediafire.com/file/1xp5xq3k ...

the plugin works great...except the eyes are weird and the car paints are flipped.
