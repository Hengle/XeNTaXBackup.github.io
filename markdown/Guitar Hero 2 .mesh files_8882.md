- Post Title: Guitar Hero 2 .mesh files

I wanted to extract some Guitar Hero 2 models, and I'm really close to it, but there's a problem. 
The model is locked in a file with .mesh format. I have no idea how to open it.
I've tried to convert it to .mesh.xml, but that didn't turn out so well.
And I've also noticed there are few threads about this already on the forums, but none of them contained my solution. And I'm sure you can extract them because I saw couple of GH2 models on Garry's Mod.
I would share some files for you to see, but I can't due to the new rules and stuff.

If I remember right the Scorehero forums had something on extracting them. Check out [http://www.scorehero.com/forum/viewforum.php?f=16](http://www.scorehero.com/forum/viewforum.php?f=16)
