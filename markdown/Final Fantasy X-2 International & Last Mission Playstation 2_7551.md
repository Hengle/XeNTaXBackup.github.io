I am wondering how one would extract models from the iso of this particular special edition of the game ( think it is a special edition). FFXtools, FFXdump, FFX Universal Extractor, FFXtool_03, FFXII Dumper don't seem to work. TOOLEXTRACT seems to be working, but it only gives me events. I want the models for ModelviewerWXD3D9, and only that.

FFXdumps all seem to either open a command prompt, then exit without doing anything, or Open and then quit working. Universal Extractor gives me a Layer 2 error for extracting LDZ and the Extract, and The tools are just the same as the dump.

I am running Windows 7 Ultimate 32 bit, with a high end processor, graphics, and 8 RAM (only 3.22 usable)

By the looks of it, you may as well run PCSX2 in accelerated mode (like GSdx or sth) and use 3DRipperDX to get some models out. It's not the "canon" way and you don't get any animations that may or may not come with them when you extract them the proper way, but it's a start. Can't advise anything else, I'm afraid. Sorry if I haven't been of help.
