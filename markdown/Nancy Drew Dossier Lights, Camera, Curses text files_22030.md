- Post Title: Nancy Drew Dossier: Lights, Camera, Curses text files

Hey guys. I am trying to make a translation for Nancy Drew Dossier: Lights, Camera, Curses. I've used unpakke and I have the files that I need to replace. I tried with HEX editor to replace the text and everything is working properly. However I can't figure out a way to do this without HEX editor. It will be impossible to do it in hex because of the length of the text that will definitely be different. Anyone can help me out? I will upload 1 of the files here:
