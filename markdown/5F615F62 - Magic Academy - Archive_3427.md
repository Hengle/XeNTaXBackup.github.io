I'll appreciate any help or guidance to unpack the "objects.dat" archive from "Magic Academy". 
The head.bin and tail.bin may be downloaded here: [http://motionpress.com/uploads/Magic_Ac ... d_tail.rar](http://motionpress.com/uploads/Magic_Academy_head_and_tail.rar)

Thanks in advance!

none of your links work. also why do you want to open these archives?
if you want textures from a 2d game use 3dripper dx it can rip all the textures for you automatically.
