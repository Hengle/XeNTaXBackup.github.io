I've been looking at Unity games a lot lately, so I checked. The global version is titled Basketrio: Allstar Streetball.

It appears that some files are encrypted and some are not. The header is a common XOR key, but from some extent each file seems to have its own independent key.
Obviously there is some degree of law in the XOR key, but I don't know. The law seems to be 0A 0B 0B * * * 7C 7D 7D * *, where one value is followed by two +1 values, then random data, then another value, then +1 values, and so on. 0x0A and 0x7C are examples only, and of course they switch randomly.
