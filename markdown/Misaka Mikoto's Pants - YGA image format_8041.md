- Post Title: Misaka Mikoto's Pants - YGA image format

Alright, so a friend and I are working on ripping the goods from "Misaka Mikoto's Pants", a wacky japanese game that is a megaman clone. We have the ripper source code [available here](http://pastie.org/3175798) that rips all the good stuff from the DAT files.

However when we rip, the image files are in some YGA format. I was wondering if I could get one of you guys/girls/etc to analyse the format, we seem to think it'll be a simple decoding task. They originally looked like TGA files, but they are different.

A demo of the game in question can be found here: [http://werk-zwei.jp/railgun/](http://werk-zwei.jp/railgun/)

Files needing attention are attached:
