- Post Title: [PC] Awesomenauts Localization

Hello, I'm trying to translate this game into Korean. 
(So, I'm not good at English. Please excuse that )

I found [an old post](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=21&t=9396) about translation of this game, so I tried that way, but I couldn't succeed. I used quickBMS for decrypt Localization.settings file, but decrypted file looks weird.

I'm veeerry noob at this topic, so somebody help me, please

OMG THANK YOU SOOOOOOOO MUCH!!!!!
But how can I encrypt files to apply changes to Awesomenauts?

I've fix dumper to encrypt dumped files using encrypt/compress functions inside program, but it's not working properly.
Awesomenauts alerts that the files have been changed, then can't start game.

Encrypted files' sizes are not same with original files'. I think this is why...
