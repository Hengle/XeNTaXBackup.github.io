It's been out for weeks and no one has looked into extracting the models? 

Anyone here or in some Discord server (I dunno) working on it? The DLCs too.

People couldn't even name a game properly, Starlight Stage and Starlit Season are two different games.

I found that out and didn't make an update. But however UE Viewer doesn't support morph export yet. Anyone has workarounds? I've read there are umodel builds that exports the morph separately as .psk so that it can be combined back into the main mesh in say, Blender as shape key.

So the topic is about Idolmaster: Starlit Season after all.

@kitakamikotoha: You can find custom umodel build with ability to export morphs [here](https://www.gildor.org/smf/index.php/topic,7112.msg39276.html#msg39276).
