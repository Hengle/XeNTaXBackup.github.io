I have extracted these files from the game archive but I need help playing them. The magic is "INDYWV"

Care to give some more info about the game like FULL name and platform? 
Also, one of the files looks cut because there's a size given that is bigger than the file itself. Apart from that, it looks like either some compressed format (though comtype_scan2 didn't come up with usable results) or some headerless psycho-acoustic format (MP3, OGG etc.)...
Upload some more files (at least 10) to take a look at them.

Hm, no new information within your reversing I'm afraid. Tried ScummRev and GAP since these are the only pre-2000 tools that could apply to those files, but no success.
Seems to use the same format as some Indiana Jones game, maybe "Indiana Jones and his Desktop Adventures" from 1997. Can't find any information about the format either. :-\ Could be anything. 

Well, was worth a try but as long as somebody with really fond information about audio codecs won't post here, there doesn't seem to be any possibility to play/decode those files.
