- Post Title: ILBM images - Les Manley 1 Game - Accolade 1990

Hi!

I need to view the extrange ILBM format images from Les Manley in search for the king game, to modify the images and then reimport it to the ILBM format of the game.
It is a extrange IFF/ILBM file.


The header from ILBM is:
FORM ILBMBMHD
(CMAP)
BODY


I want to do a translation of the game.

I extracted the images from a DAT file with Dragon Unpacked.

I tried a lot of view programs (commodore amiga programs, too), but allways I have an error that the files are corrupt.

A DAT and Some extracted ILBM files:
