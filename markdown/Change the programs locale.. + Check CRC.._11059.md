Here is a loader. [https://www.mediafire.com/?7z0d1k861ei86jn](https://www.mediafire.com/?7z0d1k861ei86jn)
This loader can't run on another windows except japanese window. Can I change the locale and charset
of this executable file? It was compiled by Borland Delphi 4.0 - 5.0 (You can check it by PEid)

 No, I mean that I want to run it under default window(not a japanse locale) and change the charset from Shift-JIS to Hangul. Like below.

 Can I add a CRC check before running a game? [https://www.mediafire.com/?2dt27iirggomqfs](https://www.mediafire.com/?2dt27iirggomqfs)
Run fixed.exe => check paul.dll => Run the game.
