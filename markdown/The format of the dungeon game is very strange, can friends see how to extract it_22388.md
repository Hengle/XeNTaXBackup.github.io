- Post Title: The format of the dungeon game is very strange, can friends see how to extract it?

Hope to extract resources from this dungeon game, the format is very special.     
I tried a lot of bms, but did not find the available script
Do guys know how to extract?

From models.csp you can extract meshes  using hex2obj (view link in my sig):

To get the textures search for "DXT" then cut of the data at the preceeding "DDS".

but there are still large model files that should be extracted to get a single one. I am uploading some samples.

I was not clear enough, it is not an .ogg file, it's a metafile of .ogg files.

there is no need for a script, just a file ripper which can extract .ogg files.

effect.csp contains dds textures, jpg and bmp files

It makes sense that I tried 2 rippers, and indeed extracted dds and jpg, but the model file seems to be unrecognizable. I uploaded a sample, do you have a look?

I cannot help you with the models. 
Have you managed to get .oggs (music files)?
