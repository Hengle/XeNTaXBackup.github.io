Excuse me for bringing this up, but there must've been a change in the .pak files,
here's a sample cut(filecutter)for you to check out when you have the time:

^ as of 1.2.1 the .pak files use different encryption. Please look into it.

I'm interesting to get some files from the game but I have no idea to how to extract these files. Any update?

Edit : I'm looking at end of the files. It will have "50 4B 05 06 00 80" in every files. So, Is it the key to decrypt?
