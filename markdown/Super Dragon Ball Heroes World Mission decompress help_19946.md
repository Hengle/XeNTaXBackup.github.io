- Post Title: Super Dragon Ball Heroes World Mission decompress help

so the files for that game are stored in .cpk which can be extracted easily. And the file extensions match up with the one from the xenoverse games.
but the files itself seem to be compressed.
im attaching the .emb (textures) and .emd (model) if anyone wants to check if its possible to decompress them.
those are the tools used for xenoverse games to convert the uncompressed .emb and .emd

would be nice if anyone could look into how to rip the models from that game as it would make a great resource since there are alot of character models in that game.
