- Post Title: Can anyone make a Custom Model Importer/Exporter for Far Cry 5?

Think anyone can try and make a model exporter for Far Cry 5?
I know what file types go in and what kind of file comes out
I may just talking nonsense, i'm not a genius when it comes to this kind of stuff, but if someone could make one, the whole Far Cry 5 modding community would sure appreciate it!

So it seems the community is not interested in it?
No one tried the tool, no one asked anything.
