- Post Title: Shadow of the Colossus PS4 Model files

I've recently extracted the models and textures from Bluepoints Shadow of the Colossus remake.

It seems Bluepoint are using an updated version of their old Ps3 formats (cmdl and xtxr) along with 2 new formats ctxc and cmsh.
These 2 new formats are dramatically larger, leading me to wonder what the other formats are actually for, as they're all 1kb, and sit inside the 'precached data' folder, so its possible they're for something else.

I've uploaded a few here for anyone to take a look at.

The models for this game are great, so it'd be pretty awesome to see them upclose outside of the game itself, if possible.

Second this request, I've done all the research I possibly can on these files and come up with precisely nothing. Can also provide files, and maybe this page can help:

I don't understand, why would that page help?
Its a different game, different engine and different formats entirely, there are no similarities even in extensions.
Are you sure you linked to the correct page?

Yes, I just checked, here's a hint: .cmsh

I'll link some files soon.

A 19 kB rar file? That's useful as a file names list only - all files contain zero bytes.

[Heres](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1IgY1_n2vPilLEb8dKcHBzg4ExgZXOaHD) a link for a few files for anyone who's interested in checking
Its just static models, the games files are organised but most files are kind of large so i just grabbed these rocks instead.

I can only see a few point clouds.

I was surprised by the small archive after I zipped it too, but I triple checked them, I even just downloaded them from the google drive now and they extract to 15mb and 76mb...

millions of bytes CAN'T be compressed to 19 kBytes, as simple as this.
Except for zero bytes, and that's what I see: zero bytes:

Clearly you worded your reply wrong, I was under the impression you were getting files with a size of 0kb extracted from the archives.  

But, I've uploaded the uncompressed archive [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1OA8GvyXsLrx0x9wr9_nsZe57z83PM0PS) in case it helps anyone as being able to extract these models would be nothing short of a dream come true, and I'm sure not just for me!

It might stay as a dream though, since there are no proper samples to work with

There may be something wrong with your file extraction procedure as all files are just 0 bytes.

I uploaded a bunch of files in my post last week, those are all compressed but are of a significant size, so try those, let me know if they don't work, I'll upload others.

There is only one extraction procedure essentially and that's the one I've used, so I'm out of ideas unfortunately.

Hi! I'm very new and very curious about the procedure to extract these models. More specifically, I am wanting to get a model of the landscape if possible, or if someone has done so already. I assume landscapes/environments are a different process, especially considering the modern LoD implementations? Any help is greatly appreciated!

EDIT: I did come across this: [https://www.psxhax.com/threads/unpackin ... post-22322](https://www.psxhax.com/threads/unpacking-fate-extella-the-umbral-star-pkg-files-help.2165/#post-22322)
