- Post Title: Ascendancy's music, and the sheer Awesomeness of MexMod

Okay, so an ancient game I used to have when I was but a wee lad was called Ascendancy, a similar game to Master of Orion, but the gameplay isn't really what's important.  For a game of its era, the music was absolutely stunning.

I've been modding Baldur's Gate 1 & 2 for years now, and one of the things I did was extract its music so I could burn it to CD or just listen to it with winamp or whatever, and then one day I was sifting through my old CDs, and came upon Ascendancy.

Hey! I thought, I can extract the sounds from this and listen to the fantastic music score again.  Long and hard did I search, and for a while I was on the brink of giving up, but then I found...

Multi Ex Commander!

To conclude this long-winded and boring tale, let me say that Mex kicked ass and took names, and I just want to let you know how grateful I am as I sit here listening to the theme songs for each race.  Woo.
