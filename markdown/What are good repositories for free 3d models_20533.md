- Post Title: What are good repositories for free 3d models?

I'm running a Fallout tabletop RPG and I use Tabletop Simulator (steam game) for combat sometimes.

They're about to deal with a road battle, so I'm looking for vehicle models to use in the game, especially a bus since that's the player vehicle.

Even so, the sites I've come across are either 100% paid, or just janky. What are some good collections out there?
