- Post Title: Assassin's Creed 1 - BAO Audio Files

I have been messing around with Assassin's Creed 1 files and managed to extract the bao audio files using the bms scripts provided in the XeNTaX forums.
Though, I have listened to all the audio files(yes.. I have listened to thousands) and it came to my attention it didn't really extract all the audio files. for example: 
Some of the dialogues between Rafiq and Altair, Malik and Altair as well, the music files as well have not been extracted at all. I am not sure if I am missing something here? 

I have also tried extracting every single .forge separately and also batch extract using the bms scripts. I tried putting the output in different folders and another in one folder and listened to them all many times. The files I have mentioned, have not been extracted.

Can someone please, assist me with this? Thank you!

Here are the bms scripts I used to extract the files in case someone wants to check them out. Any help is really appreciated!
(Don't know if this info matters but I am trying to extract the Assassin's Creed 1 the one from steam not the 360 or anything else)
