- Post Title: Ultraman Fusion Fight Ultra File+ Mons Rancher help

Good evening, I'm here looking for someone who knows about decrypting Unity files on mobile games, specifically Unity3d files and Nintendo Switch .gz files.


The files are from two games, Ultraman Fusion Fight Ultra File on mobile and Ultra Kaiju Mons Rancher for the Nintendo Switch. [https://www.deviantart.com/mmdcharizard ... -943872082](https://www.deviantart.com/mmdcharizard/journal/Ultraman-Fusion-Fight-MonRancher-Raw-Files-HELP-943872082)

Attempts to use software such as Assetstudio have ended in failure, here are the original files [https://www.mediafire.com/file/qedlmgam ... S.apk/file](https://www.mediafire.com/file/qedlmgamv22izhs/Ultraman_Fusion_Fight_FILES.apk/file)

For those that need original APK, it can be found here
