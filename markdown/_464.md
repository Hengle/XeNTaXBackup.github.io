Features in development for next release:
* [finally decided on API and implemented it for SAD archives] add/replace files in archive
* [implemented, but needs menu support and keyboard shortcut] remove file from archive
* [made more progress] make things configurable / remember old settings
* user should be able to cancel extracting
* buildscript should build .exe of command line tool
* [Made a start] create new archive


Necessary code improvements:
* [made more progress] unit tests
* unit tests for create / add / remove
* logging
* better argument parsing in command line tool
* [not necessary] change import file API to resemble zlib

Bugs / issues to be solved for next release:
* [Works well enough. Not solving] file view uses extension to guess the mime-type, should use file body. However, for quick viewing sound files I want to use the BASS library, which is Windows only. That can probably not be ported to other platforms. Another solution is to code handlers for the hundreds of soundfile types around, but that would take years.
* OpenMex seems to crash on windows 98

Bugs / issues to be solved for later release:
* wxWindows (or wxPython, not sure) bug causes MS Word .doc files to be non-viewable: find workaround or wait for fix.
* wxWindows bug makes icons look ugly in win32 builds: find workaround or wait for fix.

External issues:
* [Currently at about 20%] expand collection of test archives
* write user documentation
* write developer documentation
* improve OpenMex homepage

Wishlist for later release(s)
* drag&drop + clipboard operations
* quickview
* export archive to different format
* more detailed error reporting
* alert dialogs where user can choose not to display the dialog again
* command line tool included in build process
* make buttons platform/settings independent (right now the buttons rely on the classic Windows 98 color scheme)
* tooltips
* refactor hardcoded messages
* Optimizing
* context menu's on list view and toolbar
* enrichen descriptors
* make columns configurable
* make toolbar configurable
* file associations
* Windows explorer context menu addition + make configurable
* Keyboard shortcuts
* ** some supar secret improvements that won't be revealed until a future  release **

I understand.  It's no problem.  I'm just happy if you download them and keep the files for a while and atleast try to figure them out.  If there's anything else you might need, be sure to let me know what to look for, and I could get you something perhaps more useful.  Afterall, I don't know what these files are!  That is the point, I want to open them and see. 

As for OpenMex, it keeps getting better!  And I have to say I am very impressed with your guys' organisation.  You list exactly what you want and for a realistic release date, and you update your progress.  Nice work truely.

This seems to be a Windows 98 issue, which I'll try to fix for next release. The problem is that I currently have no Windows 98 installation (I only have access to XP and 2000 installations), so I need to get that set up before I can fix it.

Suggestion: use MultiEx

The next release will be a Beta version, and I promoted some of the outstanding code and functionality goals to reflect this.

Along with the usual maintenance (bug-fixes and refactoring), key features the beta will support are:
* Creating new archives for selected formats
* Modifying archives for selected formats
* Usability improvements
* Windows 98 support

We'll also make an efford to support many new game-formats, but that largely depends on the essential archive-analysis by Michael (and perhaps other contributors?)

Essentially, what this means is that it will be a while before next major release. We won't be announcing any dates. We're doing this in our free time so it's impossible to predict when we have time and energy to do work on this.

However, we may do intermediate releases of new archive-types. These could be added to the current, limited version of OpenMex without problem.

The good news is that, after much consideration, I finally decided to go ahead and create the final specs for the import API. As a test case, I have successfully implemented 'create', 'add', and 'remove' on our own crappy archive type. Now I can start to update the legacy scripts to support modifications, for the beta release.

Lots of work remains to be done though.

Yes, new archive types will be analysed with due time and due energy.... I have been working on LOD files from Might and Magic VI, and examined some of the Metal Gear 2 files. Time is not on my side at the moment. Nor is energy. It will be back, and that will be the time more archive formats will be presented, in OpenMEX and OpenGRAF.

Well ofcourse, you are making these programs free to the public and in your own spare time.  Take your time.  Everyone is patient and you are doing great work.  Have fun with it, and as time goes on, the program keeps getting better and better.  

Once again if I can help any more with the metal gear files don't hesitate to message me.
