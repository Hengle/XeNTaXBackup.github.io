- Post Title: obj import to xps 11.8??

hi could anyone tell me if its possible to import an obj (without textures) or stl file into xps 11.8?
wanting to pose a few models to print i have and xps fits my needs perfectly with its user friendly way to do it, as i am a total noob at rigging ect
or is there another way i can accomplish it?
tried mixamo and it doesnt work too well with the majority of models ive tried
any help and advice would be graciously recieved

best regards
