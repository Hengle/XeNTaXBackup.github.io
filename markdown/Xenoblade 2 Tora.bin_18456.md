- Post Title: Xenoblade 2 Tora.bin

I've been browsing around in the Xenoblade 2 game files and found a file called tora.bin in the minigames folder. It's got to be the game file to Tiger! Tiger!, right? If so, what could be done with it? Messing around in a text editor didn't get me anywhere... Answers would be kindly appreciated!
