- Post Title: Importing isolated vertex

Hello, There is a game which models have Isolated vertex, so once converted into obj format they have for example 629 vertex, but when importing them into 3DS MAX the vertex cout is 627, this is because the obj importer deletes isolated vertex, is there any script, or anything that will let me in 3ds to import isolated vertex? (3DS necessary since the export tool is written in MAXScript)

Thanks in advance
