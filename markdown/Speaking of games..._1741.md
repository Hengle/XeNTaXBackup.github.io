We all delve into game resource archives, but what about playing them? 

Which games do you play at the moment? 

I am currently playing Dungeon Siege II with much enjoyment.
The game I really played before this one is Painkiller + Addon. Completed it as well. 

Waiting for:  Elder Scrolls 4 (Oblivion) to be released! [http://www.elderscrolls.com](http://www.elderscrolls.com)

Excellent, I have played HOMM as well, I personally feel HOMMIII is the best of the four, but I hope that HOMM V will be as good, even though its not created by the masters of 3DO. [http://www.nival.com/homm5/](http://www.nival.com/homm5/)

I am mainly into simulations and particulary main interest of mine are game 3D terrains and 2D/3D modding. However,  I have noticed that this fills up my time completely, leaving nothing to play per se. No too good deal I am afraid.

ATM, I am playing through Enter the Matrix a second time, and am working through Dave Mirra Freestyle BMX 2 and Tiger Wood's PGA Tour 2004 (or is it '03?). I also play a handful of other games off-and-on, including Super Mario Sunshine, Nerf ArenaBlast, NFS: Underground, Jurassic Park Operation Genesis, and, of course, the game that got it started for me... Carnivores 2. Apparently, I have more free time on my hands than I thought...

Do you mean flight sims and stuff? Or also management games, like Railroad Tycoon and SimCity? I have played Transport Tycoon Deluxe to death in the past, great fun. I just couldn't get Railroad Tycoon 3 to please me though. A shame of the money I spent on it.

@Mambox, are these all PC games you talk about? What are they like?

Mr. Mouse, 
nowadays mainly flight, naval and tank sims and occasionally some strategy. Those you titles you have mentioned above I know pretty well.  Railroad Tycoon Deluxe I played, but nothing was so involving as original RrT by Sid Mayer from MPS.
I totally agree about RT3 - it was just trying to revive old fame and make some buck while doing so.   

I got to know you and your site through my interest in Gunship! when you helped and assisted to open cat files of that game. So I bookmarked your site and never lost touch ever since. Trying to explore all those coded resources in the games is the coolest thing after, or sometimes as the case is currently with me, before playing games. Lately I am trying to changing those habits and priorities though.

I'm playing World of Warcraft a bit (some friends of mine collectively lured me into it...so I'm in this guild, blah, blah, blah) and Red Orchestra (a WWII First Person Shooter UT2004 mod going retail soon). I've also fooled around with the Empire at War demo (will buy the full version when I have some cash to spare).

Studies take up most of my time though, so gaming is very sporadic atm. Checked out the Elder Scrolls 4 videos and screenies...looking sweet.

Yes, that's great stuff! I also really love Home of The Underdogs. Excellent archive. I'm somewhat of a retroman myself, having played computer games since 1982 ! ( hence : [viewtopic.php?t=857](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?t=857) )
I often read old computer magazines from around that time (Crash, Zzap64 etc.) and then get interested in some game, that I then download and fire up in an emulator.  

@NinjaMuffin: Concerning WoW, I never actually had time to play MMORPGs, it seems to me you have to spend all your daily life to ever gain a level that is acceptable. Captain once did play Ultima Online, and had some good stories to tell.

Ironically, since I started Game Extractor, I've hardily touched any game. Quite frustrating actually - I bought The Sims 2 when it first came out, but I've probably only played it for about 3 days 

My brother buys a few games a year, so I usually complete them and then stop playing - often I finish them before my brother and then he just takes my saved games  . Some of the more recent games he bought that I have finished are GTA San Andreas and Need For Speed Most Wanted. I bought Civilization 4 and I love it, but still havn't played it much. My brother just bought FEAR about a week ago, but I havn't played it yet.

Thats about it - they are probably the only games that I've played over the last few years. Oh, and I did finish Halflife 2 when that came out, and I did about half of Doom 3.

I can't speak for other MMMORPG's, but in WoW it seemed like a cool idea for a couple of IRL friends to join this guild (which we where invited to by one of my friends hardcore WoW playing little brother...I blame him for everything  ) and I guess it was ok and pretty casual for the first 30 levels or so, but when you get up to higher levels (especially after reaching the cap level of 60) all of a sudden it becomes this huge apparatus where 30+ people are involved and all of them need to work perfectly together and can't even visit the bathroom for like 6 hours or more, or the whole raidgroup risks getting wiped out. 

It's amazing how many players quit the game after reaching level 60, because after that it becomes really tedious and all you to is try to get better gear and weapons etc. However, now Blizzard will soon release an expansion pack which raises the level cap from 60 to 70...making sure the poor suckers who got hooked enough to play until level 60 will still be "using" for an extended period of time. 

A word of warning, if you haven't played WoW yet, think twice before starting. It's highly addictive and before you know it you'll be having dreams about your in-game character and all the cool gear he/she could have (if only for the sole purpose of impressing fellow players).

In the end, WoW feels more like an actual job than pure fun. Many higher level players claim to feel this way and many quit for that very reason. If it's not fun and just makes you feel bad...then what's the point of playing? Besides, it's not like it's for free either.

Elder scrolls sound more like my cup of tea. Granted, you can't play with your friends and it's not the same social experience, but on the other hand you can quit anytime you want and catch up where you left off anytime you feel like it.

Exactly. You can just continue when and where you want, and don't have to take other people into account in your decision making. I really loved Daggerfall and Morrowind as well, I think Morrowind is the best RPG ever made. I hope they can top it with Oblivion. 

@Mambox: [http://arnold.c64.org/](http://arnold.c64.org/) for a huge collection of Commodore 64 games, and [http://www.worldofspectrum.org/](http://www.worldofspectrum.org/) for a huge collection of ZX Spectrum games. 

@Watto: Civ games are excellent indeed. I still have to play Civ IV though. I fear my computer isn't up to it. Doom 3 I started and then quicky removed from my hard-drive, I thought that was a load of bull. Gameplay from the Stone Age. In my opinion, they should have stopped at Doom 2. Id software just released a game that is not of this day in age. The only thing they are good at is building an engine. They totally lack skills in the gameplay area. But for me that's not enough. 

Half Life 2 on the other hand was very good, though still linear. But the story and gameplay was excellent.

I think you're dead on about Doom 3. It was insanely hyped up and when I finally tried it I just got the "been there done that" feeling...nothing new whatsoever. Sure, the graphics are nice, but so where HL2 which I also thought had a good story with good atmospehere and gameplay you easliy got involved with. Because of this, the linear style of the game was not hard to forgive.

Speaking of engines, I'm looking forward to the Unreal 3 engine. Sure, it will hardly have much new in terms of gameplay...but what I've seen of the graphics so far it looks really sweet.

Then again, so does Elders Scrolls 4. I heard rumors about it using the Unreal 3 engine, but now I read somewhere else this is not so. Anyone know something more about this?

Oblivion uses a custom Gamebryo engine.

Is there anything yet with double digit prefix? 

I think no wonder that those titles make us attracted like moth to light, but there is NEVER anything like the originals. And even now going back to the originals it is not anymore the same. 
Very fleeting and special relation those old games had with us. 
I must say that I sometimes I feel very lucky that I had a pleasure to enjoy them exactly in the moment of their highest glory. Graphics were klunky (Zork had none), sounds primitive (beep beep beep), but they were to me like the Visions Out of this World.  The originality and the storyline, creativity of the authors and the fact that my own imagination was always "on" like in the books. 
Very special time...  and feel very lucky and thankfull.    

PS. Here are some of them and they might sound really maybe lame now: 

* found the card in the pocket of SQ1 character after I typed "search body" ....
* got the beeped by the game character the following morning after I entered my real beeper number during previous evening game sesion....
* met first alien in Starflight, later found and recognised forgotten Earth in AD 3000, or something like that ....
* found an answer to the puzzle by licking   the wall in Stationfall...
* saw the glint of the light of somebody watching me in the eyeholes of the  portrait over the mantelpiece in "Colonel Bequest" ....
* got chilled scared by Shodan voice in System Shock 1....

Hehe, yes...I too have got a lot of memorable moments in gaming. Starting from that ol' Commodore VIC20.  

* Lords of Midnight completely took all of my spare and not so spare time until I won the battle against Doomdark. I wrote complete stories of Lords battling it out in the game, created a huge map etc. Today the graphics mean nothing, but at the time all you needed was fantasy..it was like I was really in that world. 

* At the time of Doom and Doom 2 we (The Gee and I) were living in a flat in some suburb of the city, where you could hear the wind howl around the flat, much like the sounds of wind and machines in the movie Alien. Playing Doom 2 at night with this sound at the background was excellently scary. 

* The first time I played Thief made me bow in honour to those excellent people at Looking Glass studios (yes, the same that brought you System Shock). Thief was excellent, and also very exciting as you had to actually avoid battle with people, which made it a very tense experience as you waited in the shadows until guards passed by, afraid to be spotted. Thief 3 was an excellent experience as well, with the Shalebridge Cradle level the scariest level of any game I have ever played. Supreme! 

ah and many more memories....

The point I was trying to make that something has changed in the game industry. It is sad observation and let me hope that it is because of ... not quite advanced yet,  but shall we say ... progressing age. I find hardly any originality and creativity, or fresh ideas. Is it me, or PC gaming is visibly in the decline. 

I used to come to game shop and I wanted to play most of the games found there. Now I see so many colorfull boxes, but nothing really catches my eye. No more surprises, I know already what is there inside that box. Besides, PC gaming goes to the most remote corners of the shops. Is this the begining of "gone with the wind" era?  

Little sad, but this is the reason I perhaps turned to modding. Nostalgia after the past  and trying to relive those memorable moments.

Ouch...

Maybe I'm also just getting old, but I also find good gameplay is good to find nowadays. I remeber the C64 with extremely crappy graphics by todays standard, but perhaps becuase the developers at that time couldn't depend to much on cool effects (which to me seems to be the main focus today), they had to put more energy on creating a immersive gameplay?

Btw, anyone played a game called M.U.L.E.?

Extremely simple graphics, very simple sound and when you first look at it didn't seem like much...but man what a great and fun game that was.

I also remember me and my friend sitting up many long nights with Elite (the mother of all spaceship travelling and trading games) getting killed over and over and having to save and reload the game on TAPE RECORDER which took like forever...but we still did it.

I wonder, is actually the games that are getting crappier...or are we just becoming harder and harder to please with old age?

Lets face it...maybe it's time to start going to the park and play chess with the rest of the old geezers...

Oh yes. M.U.L.E. is a definite classic. 

So is Elite, I have spent day and night playing that game. Simply excellent.

The C64 is my mothercomputer, even though I have had a Commodore VIC20 and MSX 1 and MSX 2. The C64 was simply brilliant and I have had good times in the C64 demo scene in Europe.     

Crazy Comets, Monty On The Run, Commando, Return of the Mutant Camels ... to name but a few classics. Rob Hubbard's music even now is superb and I listen to sid music weekly. Ok, so I am an old freak, so be it. 

In the early ninenties a bunch of Dutch and English wizards even pulled it off to convert Lemmings to the C64, truly an amazing feat considering the limitations they had to overcome at the time, with only 64K max, and only 8 hardware sprites.

Oh I could go on and on....  

Dune 2 on the Amiga was also a way of life for me, as was Syndicate. I have played that last battle of Dune 2 over and over and over to perfect the time I completed it, and even recorded it on video just to review what I had done and how I could improve it next time (there was no "replay" option as in C&C Generals and Warcraft III eh!).  

But the call for innovation in games is really not new. I can show you editorials from game magazines as early as 1985 that already complain about the lack of innovation and "been there-done that" feel they got. 

But you're right. There are few games these days that attract my attention. Young people see these type of games for the first time, so it a first for them, but I know better and know where the original games came from.  Yep, must be getting old.

I also think sometimes that the original games were little like art pieces. There was much more there than just a piece of computer code.  They were really making us to live those stories, but maybe because they were able to engage our imaginations. 

Today the push is to make it just "glitzy". And there is no more diversity inside the games. If there is a shooter you may expect nothing but that.  And I think they are little shallow. No offence hard working game developers, please.

Game like Loom comes to my mind. Not the most prominent , but nevertheless special.  Not only good story, but idea of glueing music to the puzzles was simply creative and original. That is all what was and still is expected and awaited from the games.  

I tried MULE, but that was already 386 remake version, not the original.  Sadly did not make too much impression on me, but I have heard it was good. Harvesting, finding resources and goods and selling it later in Starflight was the same idea. I think that entire Privateer was  built around this concept, but since it was already nothing new I did not like it. 

Oh ... I could go on and on ....

The last good game was ....... ???

Hehe, well, it's not all that bad. For instance, like I said, I loved Daggerfall and Morrowind, and I can't wait to get my hands on Oblivion, which is GOLD and should be released the 20th of March! 

I also thought that S.T.A.L.K.E.R. would be something different as a shooter, but it is plagued with setbacks and delays that makes me wonder if it will be as good as expected when it's released.

Sadly, publishers often set unrealistic deadlines on developers for the completion of games, rather than doing the *logical* and most likely *money-saving* thing of giving the developers enough time to actually finish all planned features, get them tested, and add extra stuff they might think of towards the end... I think if publishers would just start pushing deadlines back, we could potentialy see the quality of games increase. But then, this is just the humble opinion of a game-programmer-to-be...

S.T.A.L.K.E.R. seemed very promising and I read that the pulishers were unhappy whith all the delays and setbacks so they are now pushing to get it released regardless of what state it's in...which really would be a shame.

In general, I agree with your statement that not stressing developers with short deadlines would be better for quality.

However, as long as cool graphics and supporting the latest hardware is expected from the consumers (or the publishers firmly believe this to be the case) the developing timeframe will be dictated by the release of new hardware (graphic cards etc). No one seems keen to take the extra costs for switching engines in mid-production for example...and we all know too well about games like Duke Nuke 'em Forever...which has been in "development" for how long?  

Also, as games become more and more linked together with movies and the movie industry, keeping deadlines becomes even more crucial. You need to release the game title roughly around the same as the corresponding movie...or the positive mutual promotion effect will be lost and so on.

Bottom line, I agree with you that quality should not be compromised...but that would also mean that we as consumers also can't ask for our games to utilize the latest technology. The stakes are just too high on the producing end...longer developing times are extremely costly and a high riskfactor for all involved.

I'm not saying I like it any more than you do. I'm just saying that us consumers might have a big part in it by always wanting the latest and coolest looking stuff. To be completely honest...aren't we all in the end just suckers for shiny and pretty stuff if we can get our hands on it?

I tend to disagree on the latter statement. It's not that we as consumers want the latest technology, it's the industry that forces this on us. 

Developers no longer push the maximum possibilities out of the hardware that is available, coming up with brilliant routines. No, instead they rely heavily on new hardware to come out to support their sloppy routines. As an old geezer, I remember programmers did their very best to make brilliant use of the Commodore 64 hardware, by very clever coding routines.That is of the past, obviously, as developers no longer have time to sit down and make their code as efficient as possible.There are deadlines to meet. 

I seriously hate it when I have a perfectly ok system and some game comes out that requires a huge upgrade to run smoothly. Thus, the industry forces this down my throat, it's not that I ask for it. Coders should instead use their brains to create fast routines, and not rely on the latest AMD chip and Gayforce card make the routine faster.

Good points...sorry for not replying sooner, been very busy IRL.

I'd agree that the envelope is probably not really pushed for the hardware as it used to be (except for perhaps in some degree certain gamingconsoles, when the hardware might be around for a bit longer at least compared to graphics cards).

The C64 is a very good example, however it was also around and used for quite some time. Nowadays, the whole consumer market is focused on short term usage. Hardware is built with shorter durability lifespan as consumers are expected to change "models" pretty quickly.

I agree that this is forced upon us, but it's not like the games industry are alone in this. The whole market economy is based on consuming...and the concept of giving the customers "what they want" when it is in fact the producers who in large dictate what that is. Although I think you are right in essence, I also think that as long as most people rush to buy the latest stuff (whether it be a graphics card, TV or stereo) the producers will continue to do their best to supply what people "want".

Of course it is in their best interest to sell a new product every 2 months or so...effectively "recycling" old customers and their cash over and over again. I also think many customers are getting fed up with the situation...and when it comes to gaming communities like this one is a good example of sticking to what "works" and being creative and add their own longterm value to for example games by modding etc.

In all I agree with your points 100%, but I also think consumers play an important part in this. There is a certain demand from buyers...and as long as that exists producers/sellers will take advantage of the situation best they can. It is hard for one to exist without the other so to speak.

Cheers

I have to chime in even my view is so pesymistic here. 

IMHO the industry simply has abandoned "educated consumer". It caters no longer entertainment with some "food for brain". It mainly caters only and purposedly the same, brainless, repeateable, easy, short and frankly boring pieces of gaming with hardly any contents. All that to buy new, buy again, buy more.  Nothing personal, but just simply business. 

And yes, the "new" games are always glitzy and more technically shinier than previous title. That thanks mainly to new hardware, which is compulsory of course. What we have now Playstation 3 ...? Is something really so obsolete with previous Playstation2 or whatever there? Xbox?  and all that other modern console stuff. Its a race of a giants and they really dictate and tell what the crowd suppose to "want".   

PC gaming is in the remission and regress. Is being simply pushed out - just take a good look at your software shop. My opinion and "conspiracy" theory is that PC crowd is no longer recognised as a buying mass. Why? Perhaps because they GETTING OLDER  , they like to think sometimes how those game things are made, they have those memories of past good times and ... behold, those PC users dare to mod.  

I know, I know ... a rant of the old geezer. So now is all out...

Just saw Elder Scrolls Oblivion "live" so to speak and it looks absolutely gorgeous. Gameplay also seems pretty cool too from what I could tell.

However, no chance in hell for me to run it smoothly on my current computer, so I guess I'm looking at buying at least a new graphics card.

Mr Mouse has a good point indeed, I bought my computer last year and it was then considered "mid-range" performance wise. Stuff you buy sure gets old very fast nowadays.

Same here. I bought Oblivion only to be served a slideshow. Now, I do have the "minimum" required specs. Apperently this is just the minimum to even show anything on screen.    

So, I'm planning an upgrade the coming month. Already ordered a better mobo. I'll just do a budget upgrade though, not going for the latest of graphics card, but mid-range. 

It's a real bummer to buy the game you've been waiting for since ages and not being able to play it.

I'm addict to Rainbow Islands and Bubble bobble , okay sometimes pang and out run.

And i agree the "old games" are better than the actual games, can found a game with 10.000!! levels in 48 kb's? (The sentinell). 
You can found remake called Sentry [http://www.remakes.org](http://www.remakes.org).

Talking about creativity of older titles, great story ideas and grand potential of gaming media brought (purposedly  ) to the ground.

Did you know that Sierra's "Gabriel Knight 3" was actually "Da Vinci Code" story. It was limited to French area and obscured by  "Gabriel Knight"serial title, but the concept was there and the same.  Now talking about that copywrite rights and all that pre movie hoopla.

Anyway, I have now upgraded my system. 

New:

ASUS A8N-SLI Motherboard
AMD 3700+ 
NVIDIA Geforce 7600GT
2 GB internal memory

Oblivon runs smoothly now with all knobs on!   

Speaking of games, 

We (Captain Corny, The Gee, Rogue and I) used to play Micromachines 2 against eachother, which was hilarious. We used to go to one of our places, buy lots of beer and then play MM2 on one computer (sitting with 4 people around a screen, three using the keyboard and one unfortunate one with a joystick) until the early hours. That was great, great fun.

Still on the subject of games, this page I created in the past 

[http://www.xentax.com/taoc/swsounds.htm](http://www.xentax.com/taoc/swsounds.htm)

My favourite sounds! Actually, our group of friends found Shadow Warrior's Lo Wang's comments absolutely hilarious. 

Captain and I used to play this game against eachother when living in the same house during our university years. Fucking brilliant. In the game you can send these sounds to the other players whenever you feel like it. Image the agression boiling when you were just gibbed to pieces by your "friend"'s rocket and hear him taunting "You so stuuupid,  you can't find ass with both hands!". With total lack of patience you slam the keyboard to spawn as soon as technically possible to make him pay dearly.

Just a coffeebreak thought. Between all the hassle of daily life, I always try to find time to play an actual game. 

My recent games include Oblivion, which I've completed and currently I play the odd game of Company of Heroes. 

Oblivion was fantastic throughout, though I got a bit bored by those damn Oblivion Gates. They were more like a nusance, and at one point I had to destroy a lot of them. But I used a simple but effective tactic. I rushed them. I went in and ran all the way up to the top of the main tower, never stopping to fight once. Once up there, I could destroy it and all enemies would be killed anyway, give or take a few.  Another thing that griped me was the fact that NPCs responded inappropriately to me when I was clearly their superior. For instance, I made it to the top of the Mage's Guild and became Arch-Mage. Now, I still got the odd "I'm sure you have something very important to say, but I don't have time right now" or something similar from other - lesser - mages at the compound. Now, as I'm their boss, they'd better bow if I so much as blink an eye at them!
Or here I go, just having saved the world as we know it, and given the rank of Imperial Legion or whatever hugely important title given to extremely skillful swordsmen, and upon visiting the Fighter's Guild I have to start all the way down like some amateur, even though they recognize me as The Saviour Of All. That sort of thing should have been properly implemented I think. Oh and the fact that enemies levelled-up with me got irritating, as you'd never really feel that you've gained in power. Having just killed some important evil mage in a hard-won battle, I had to run from simple beasts in the wilderness as they could still kill me with a simple few blows. That's a load of bull in my book.   

Company of Heroes was nice in the beginning, but the micromanagement is starting to piss me off. :/

Lol, this is getting a monologue. Oh well, one more post..   Currently playing Overlord, a sort of 3d person Dungeon Keeper, but without the RTS bit and more focused on tactical combat. 

So far it's turning out a quite nice experience, and you can be really evil. Yet, the evilness doesn't seem to effect missions much, which is a shame. Still, i may be tempted to start it up once again to destroy all the do-gooders and let my Minions have at them.

Well, I don't know if that 99% is accurate, but yes, I agree a lot of it is bullshit. 

There are however some real gems. Honest!

I name Command and Conquer 1 and Red Alert, Elite, Morrowind, Oblivion, Baldur's Gate, Homeworld, Master of Orion, Civilization, Worms 1, Doom, Unreal, Counterstrike, Half Life, WarCraft, Fallout, Starcraft, Dungeon Keeper and many more. 

But, on the whole, these might indeed be 1% of the total available.

I love classics or anything that makes me feel nostalgic.

My ranking old games that I play in a given week are:
Jedi Knight: Dark Forces II
Master of Orion 2
Star Control 2

I also play several other games throughout a given week. These include:
Neverwinter Nights
Dungeon Siege
Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory
Voyage Century Online (MMORPG)
Homeworld 2
Hitman 2
Freelancer
Team Fortress Classic.

I run a Freelancer Server and I have a friend who runs a TFC server so I play those more often than anything else. I love many games, but the classics will always hold a place in my heart.

Oh my god, yes, Operation Wolf! During a summer holiday - waaaay back - at some bungalow-swimming pool paradise, my mate Mr.Ammo and I nearly spent every cent we had on Operation Wolf at the on-site arcades. The game was brand new and we were totally addicted to it. We played on and on, taking turns, until we had reached the final level and the plane was already lifting off with us and the hostages. Only a few seconds more.............but we were shot. And had no more money to continue..........what a bummer, I can tell you ("WTF!! NO!! ALL THIS FOR NOTHING!!!"). But a great game. 

And of course, Out Run is a favourite as well. Afterburner I did a couple of times, could not really get into it. The others I've only played at home computers.

I must say, I have seriously enjoyed Episode One and Episode Two of Half Life 2, more or less recently. 

Both Episodes end with nice cliff-hangers that urge you to play the next Episode. Though the duration of the gameplay is not that long (compared to Half Life 2), it is well worth it. There's a real sense of being part of something in these Half Life games, something that happens very rarely in games (Morrowind and Oblivion, for instance, also do that for me, but even they don't have that much interaction with NPCs as convincing as in the Half Life series). 

A part from that, the voice acting and story telling is also very good in Half Life 2 (and the Episodes). Quite funny and entangling, with realistic comments made throughout by NPCs.

Spore definitely sucks big time. Childish, lame phases, dull, unchallenging, boring. EA has delivered a very poor game indeed, with a awfull DRM. Avoid at all cost. This has got to be the Duck of the Year. Highly anticipated, extremely bad final result, not living up to any of the expectations.

There, I had to say it. Fuck EA.

oh yeah, i forgot about this thread, i wanted to post about dracula: origin
its a third person point-and-clink adventure game, its not anything special and its puzzles are kinda annoying
and the voice acting SuCkS!
all in all, its kinda lame, i ripped its movies
they were in .bik format inside one of the game's .pak archives, sadly, they didn't have audio since the audio is stored in 2 other .pak files and generally everything content based is inside .pak archives

ps it would be pretty easy to make a Dracula Origin .pak extractor since the game uses a data.txt to link to files or just list them or something...i'll upload the data.txt if someone's interested

but there is already a post here anyways:

We'd usually meet up at one of our place's at 8 pm (Captain Corny, The Gee, Rogue and yours truly), well, mostly Captain Corny and mine, because we were housemates at the time . We stack a few crates of beer and played Micro Machines 2 on one PC: six hands on one keyboard, and one with the joystick. Those with the keyboard had the advantage over the one with the joystick, so we rotated to make sure everyone got a fair chance. Mind you, playing the red car (also keyboard) is an established advantage as well.  Naturally, as those who have played that game will know, these races could be hilarious, hectic, humorous, but extremely competative!! While we took up more beers, the laughter turned to screams of anger, taunting and general complete loss of sportsmanlike play.  We would play this until the early hours, regularly going out in the city afterwards. We must have done dozens of those MM2 + beer sessions!!! Those were the days!!!

I remember the time that a "not named" person ran off back home in frustration without the other ones even noticing untill after the game (hehe, shows the tension and dedication to the game      ). But really it was all in good funm !!!!(hehe, untill the neighbours downstairs complained about our session, which we usually ignored  )

Just for the record, that "Unnamed" person wasn't me.  But I remember we looked all over the house, to find him (perhaps he was just getting fresh beers ), but then realised he wasn't in the house. We traced his footsteps (it was snowing at the time) from the porch to the lightpost on the paveway where he'd parked his bike. It was gone, along with him, obviously   Later he would testify that he left in anger as he couldn't handle the frustration any longer.
