- Post Title: Sudden Strike 3 .psy

Hello,

I am new here, not sure if it is the correct section, so pardon me if it isn't.

Recently been playing around with Sudden Strike 3, an old favourite of mine. The game had its own tools to import and deal with modelling, but not for particle systems. Does someone now how to work with these files? I'll attach examples.

EDIT: Apparently, psy extension is not allowed. I uploaded a rar with two psy files.

Thanks.
