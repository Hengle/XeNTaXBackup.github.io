- Post Title: AW models Vertex error

(i hope i'm in the right area of the forum) 
I'm new to 3ds max atm, and i need help with the models vertex errors.. i searched google but idk if i'm typing something in wrong or what, but i'm not finding anything. The stretched triangles are not in the render though.
Any help for my slow brain will be greatly appreciated.

i'm guessing bone scale is bone size maybe? i lowered the bone size in the actor x importer, and the bones were thinner but still spiked out of the mesh. or is it in the script text? srry for my lack in this.

change the bone size to something like .01 or .03 and see if that helps.
