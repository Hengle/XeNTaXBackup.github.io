- Post Title: New compressed NCGR

[http://www.sendspace.com/file/hadd9n](http://www.sendspace.com/file/hadd9n)

So far the other "NC" files work, but the NCGR from this game has an extra header and some form of compression. This isn't the only game I've caught with this certain problem. If more examples are needed just ask and I'll be happy to supply them.
