- Post Title: Dishonored 2 .edgeanim and .edgeskel

Hey guys. I started this topic in hopes that a skilled reverse engineer could figure out Dishonored 2's .edgeanim format (used in several other games), and create an exporter. There is already an exporter for the .bmd6model format available here: [viewtopic.php?f=18&t=15518](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=18&t=15518)

I would make a thread over in 3D/2D models as this is the Graphic file formats section, and these aren't graphic file formats.
