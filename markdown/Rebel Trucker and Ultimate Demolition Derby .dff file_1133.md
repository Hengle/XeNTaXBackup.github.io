Here's a .dff file from the games Rebel Trucker and Ultimate Demolition Derby. They're both made by 3Romans for Global Star Software, so they're probably the same format. But I'll upload one file from each game for you to check.

And here's from Ultimate Demolition Derby...

(I'm not sure if these are archives or not, there are a couple other extensions for these games that might be though...)

Hey,

Sorry for not replying - I have been away for a few days.

I did take a look at the files when you first posted them, but I don't think I found anything useful in them - are you sure they are archives?

No, I'm not, and from their small sizes, I'm pretty confident in saying that they are not archives. i just wanted to be sure. I'll get the next type uploaded, then...

Me neither, I did not find anything useful in there. 

By the way, thanks for the email on the downtime of the forum! Although we knew it, it was up to our host to fix the problem. It seems they did!

You're welc, for the email that is. I still don't know enough about determining file structures at a glance, otherwise I probably wouldn't have bothered with this post...
