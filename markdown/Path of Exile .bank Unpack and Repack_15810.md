- Post Title: Path of Exile *.bank Unpack and Repack

Interested as I can unpack files *.bank then to remove unwanted sounds and repack back.
Files located in a directory FTOD\Desktop which suggests that the program is used FMOD Studio. 
I tried using FsbExtractor and I get to unpack the *.ogg files, but how do I pack the files back?
Also there is a problem when reading *.ogg, they can not be played.
About the game, it does not swear even if completely empty the contents of files *.bank but this is not necessary. 
I need to delete only specific sounds.

Edit: I can to unpack *.bank files using the quickbms and fsb_aud_extr and received the normal files *.wav but how to pack the files back?
