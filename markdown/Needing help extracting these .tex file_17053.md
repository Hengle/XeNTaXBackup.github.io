They are PNGs with added "header". If you will want to change the texture, you need to discover the meanings if the header. If not, just remove first 28 bytes (until you reach â€°PNG...) with some hex editor and save it with .png extension.

this bms script will automate the cleanup of header and will write out original header for reimport i guess 

```

get NAME basename
get SIZE asize
math SIZE - 0x1c
string HEADER = NAME
string HEADER + .header
string NAME + .png
log NAME 0x1c SIZE
log HEADER 0x0 0x1c
```
