Game pack files can be unpacked using Pack File Manager [https://sourceforge.net/projects/packfilemanager/](https://sourceforge.net/projects/packfilemanager/)
Textures are standard DDS.

Models are have the rigid_model_v2 extension with a RMV2 header.
However the existing Total War Warhammer II (2) 3ds max script is unable to import meshes.

Is that with a new script or the TWW2 script?

Sounds good, once it is usable I will do the usual batch conversion and upload.

A Noesis script would be great too! I found it much more fiendly to people like me who know next to nothing about 3d modeling.
Not to mention free

Yeah, noesis script! There's a great one for total war 2, not made by me of course. I'm sure very, very soon it will be updated  I could and will make maxscript for some people to use, main tool is noesis script I'm aware of that

I would not count on a TWW3 noesis script, there is one for TWW2 but it does not get skeletons.

Well, I'm always glad to see other people making tools for games - so, I hope it will be updated  Noesis is a great tool - plugins for it are great assets. As for certain total war noesis plugin - I believe, someone told me it's importing meshes with working animation! It's amazing  Though, of course I'll do my part as maxscript release if there will be a need for it!

What are you talking about, there's one in a thread on this same page that gets skeletons, animations, UVs and can even cycle between LODs

I guess i will come back from my RE break at least to update my noesis script 
but as i havent touched this stuff in 8 months or so i am kind of rusty.. it will probably take me a while depending how many changes were made to new format.

your original maxscript for total war warhammer was the basis for my first real script in noesis - so for me maxscritp is main tool

I tried to use Ninja Ripper but the meshes were all 'exploded'.  Has anyone had any luck using Ninja Ripper with TW3?  I tried forcing the game to run on Directx 11 but NJ still didn't work even with D3D11 wrapper. The other options just cause game to crash.

I had the same issue even taking the models directly from the .pak files I think its just an incompatibility with the tools atm
