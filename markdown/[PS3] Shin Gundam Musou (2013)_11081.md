C:\Workspace\Xentax\[PS3] Shin Gundam Musou\

that's why. now it should scan the program directory instead.

Wrong dds header. Open that crap in texture finder in order to know the exact dtx format.

actually i know about that problem... i could have fixed it, but it would have broken the textures in One Piece KM lol. this also works with OPKM 1 and 2. don't know why they changed the format for those useless GUI textures.

with shift+RMB select armature
press ctrl+p =>make parent=>armature=>don't create groups

that's what i'm looked for, thank you.

EDIT:

do we need those .bin and .arc files after extraction? or we can delete them?

thats too bad, i really want to rip the 2D characters images
is there any way your ripper could detect which textures are loaded from? (OPKM or SGM)

you're welcome. 

it's been a long time since i worked on this tool and i haven't been very active as of late so i don't remember if my tool worked on the DLC files, that is, if you can unpack the PKG files. i just don't remember. some people sent me the DLC files for the arios gundam and others but i think i deleted them a long time ago. you can also google for "Steven's Gas Machine" which should lead you to the latest version of the tool, and it should say whether DLC files are supported or not.
