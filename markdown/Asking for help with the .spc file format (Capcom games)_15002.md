- Post Title: Asking for help with the .spc file format (Capcom games)

Hey guys,

So I was attempting to mess around with the audio for Dragon's Dogma on PC, but I ran into the same problem as with other Capcom games, like RE5 and RE6.  Namely, all the voice files for the character soundsets are inside a file format called .spc.

I am going to post a link to a .spc that I was able to extract using the ARCTool in case anyone wants to try helping out with it.  Here it is.  I think this is one of the main character sound sets:

[http://www.mediafire.com/download/nbvsq ... vo_f01.spc](http://www.mediafire.com/download/nbvsqkk6zfnen84/pl_vo_f01.spc)

Apparently, there was a guy on this forum, Gh0stBlade who actually figured out how to do it and created a tool, but something happened back then and now all the links are dead.  Maybe he is still around and can help out, but I figured I would post this link up here if anyone wants to give it a shot.  

Thanks for any help that can be offered.  Take care.
