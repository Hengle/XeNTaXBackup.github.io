- Post Title: DOA2U, DOA4, DOAX2

HELLO GUYS I'm THESIERRAMAN, Can you help me, I have some situations for resolve:

FIRST SITUATION:
I have DOA2U (FOR XBOX 1), DOA4 (FOR XBOX 360) AND DOAX2 (FOR XBOX 360), all these games in "ISO", and I would like to extract the archives, I tried with MagicIso, but in the 3 games MagicIso didn't show me the archives, only some videos about "THIS IS A XBOX GAME, ONLY CAN BE USED IN A XBOX CONSOLE", my question is: What programs can I use for extract the archives from these 3 games (DOA2U (FOR XBOX 1), DOA4 (FOR XBOX 360) AND DOAX2 (FOR XBOX 360))??? and if is possibily can you put the links for download from mediafire please.

SECOND SITUATION:
I have "Noesis" program, but i dont know how can use it, Do you have a tutorial for use it??? I said that because in the program I'm watching a extention for DOAX2 and would like to use it for this game.

Thanks for your help and attention
