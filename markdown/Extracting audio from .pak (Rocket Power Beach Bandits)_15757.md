- Post Title: Extracting audio from .pak (Rocket Power Beach Bandits)

So, right off the bat, I have pretty much no experience working with programming, so apologies in advance if I don't quite understand something.  I have an ISO of an old GCN game, Rocket Power.  When I explore the ISO contents in the Dolphin Emulator, the file that contains all the textures, audio, pretty much everything, is a .pak file.  For the life of me I've scoured the internet for some kind of tool that can open the file or extract the contents from the .pak, but to no avail.  The very few tools I've found simply can't open it for unknown reasons.  Does anybody have any idea how to extract the audio from the file?  Any help at all is appreciated.  Thanks.
