- Post Title: Looking for a xenontexture converter

I am looking for a copy of the converter seen in this thread:
[viewtopic.php?f=18&t=9189](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=18&t=9189)

I did not want to bump the original, so I made this post instead.

Sorry for the late bump, but I still have not found a way to open these files.
