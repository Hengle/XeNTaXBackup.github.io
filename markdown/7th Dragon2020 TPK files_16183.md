- Post Title: 7th Dragon2020 TPK files

Hi there! 

Uh I hope this is the right place to post this but I'm trying to get the portraits from 7th dragon 2020 and 7th dragon 2020 II. Managed to decrypt and extract all the files in the cpk but now all of the files are in .tpk format. Does anyone know how I would go about unpacking this?

Edit: I forgot to add a sample file. This is one of the .tpks I plucked from the UI/Face folder
