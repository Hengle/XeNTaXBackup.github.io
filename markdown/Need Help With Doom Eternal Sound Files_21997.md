- Post Title: Need Help With Doom Eternal Sound Files

I've been trying to find a way to extract Doom Eternals files to get my hands on the weapon sound files as well as the Doom marine grunt and voice files so I can make a mod out of them. I've tried DoomEX and a SFX/Music extractor so far with no luck as of yet. Any help?

Use RavioliGameTools. But you don't get any filename.

Ravioli did it for me, just ripped the sfx a couple of days ago. I got around 10k files out of it, of which ~780 are voice files, 8.3k sfx and ~950 music files. Files will be named just something along the lines of "File####" so it wont be helpful to find what you need, but if you're patient and listen to them, you will. Good luck!
