Hi all,

Is there anybody here how to make à private serveur for an Android game called marvel future fight ?
It's just for a test.
All the inventory are stock on netmarble servers.
With a friend, we want to make a server test.
So i've got more questions, is there a possibility for examples to snif network With a tool like wireshark and bluestack ?
The idea is install game on bluestack With a random account then laucnh the game and launch wireshark to know how the route Will be choose by the game to connect.
Then With a test apk, connect the game on other ip adress(server private test).

Thanks.

I remember that a pc game like gunz the duel could connect on a private server.
And this private could manage inventory, shops, etc...
