Can the MultiEx Commander program identify any files not specifically supported by it?

No, not as yet. 

But there are plans in the pipeline for a new tool (also runable from within MultiEx Commander) codenamed Eureka, that will help you identify unknown formats and will go a long way in recognizing unsupported formats. But don't hold your breath yet, because it is still in a rudimentary stage.
