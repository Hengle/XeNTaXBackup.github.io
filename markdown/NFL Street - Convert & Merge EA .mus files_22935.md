- Post Title: NFL Street - Convert & Merge EA .mus files?

Hello everyone!

I want to merge & export 1,950 .mus files from a PS2 .DAT file, from video game NFL Street (the first one). Each file is two seconds long, based on VLC Media playback. 

Link to file for those interested: [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1L8x9EF ... sp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1L8x9EFDTxzb8rBATO-buYAfj4SYfoDzX/view?usp=sharing)

Unfortunately, converting .mus files to .wav using VLC Media player because of lessened bitrate quality, and each converted file lops off vital nanoseconds for seamless playback when grouped. Interestingly enough. NFL Street has a FEMUSIC.DAT file that has 12 or so licensed music tracks all intact (nothing broken up)

Tools I am using:
- Audacity
- Nova Extractor v1.3
- VLC Media Player
- PATHFIND.DAT file from PS2 game NFL Street 1

I stumbled upon this EA Sound eXchange wiki - [https://wiki.multimedia.cx/index.php?ti ... d_eXchange](https://wiki.multimedia.cx/index.php?title=Electronic_Arts_Sound_eXchange)
And this video guide based on EA .mus Skate - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKFY7QPot4E](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKFY7QPot4E)

But I am at my wits end. Help is very appreciated!! Thank you

bump. i'd also like to figure this out. if you run the game through PSound it gives you a similar number of audio files except they come out as noise bc they haven't been decoded
