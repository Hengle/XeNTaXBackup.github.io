- Post Title: motherboard from another ps3

My ps3 is broken. Is it possible to put a motherboard from another ps3 into it? I have been reliably informed that mine is totally beyond repair, but I have found other faulty ps3's for sale from about Â£40. Has anyone got any experience with this? Or any suggestions? Cheers, guys and gals!

you can not swap motherboards from ps3 to ps3 unless you swap the drive also witch at that point its a new ps3.
also if you swaped motherboards all your data will be lost.
