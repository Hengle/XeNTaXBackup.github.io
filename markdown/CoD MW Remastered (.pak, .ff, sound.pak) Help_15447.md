Can anyone please analyze the following resources ? Most probably compression used on imagefile pak's and .ff's is LZ4 and for sound pak's FLAC audio format is used mostly. Here are samples :-

imagefile18.pak

```
https://www.datafilehost.com/d/b5bd75c1
```

techsets_sniperescape.ff

```
https://www.datafilehost.com/d/d138e485
```

soundfile28.pak

```
https://www.datafilehost.com/d/ce288dae
```

A note, after opening the download link, pls untick "Download with Secured Download manager" to download the file.

Please share your thoughts here or if possible write an extractor.

soundfile28 is a normal uncompressed package. I used Wraith to unpack and interesting enough when looking at the pak it starts with 

```
fLaC...".........h.ÄBð.D.¾z).m.„.Y.Üâ.ËØäÀ...( ...reference libFLAC 1.2.1 20070917........fsizß¸
```


however the extracted file shows 

```
RIFF.'..WAVEfmt ........D¬...±........dataø&..........þÿ........................ÿÿ..........................ÿÿ..ÿÿ......ÿÿ..................ÿÿÿÿ......þÿ..................ÿÿ........ÿÿÿÿ......þÿ
```


Your normal RIFF wave format....

Does anyone have access to texts of the game? I've translated the original game with the help of ModTools, and now I'd like to both update and adapt my translation into the Remastered version.

Thanks in advance.
