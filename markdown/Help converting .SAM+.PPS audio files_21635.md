- Post Title: Help converting .SAM+.PPS audio files

I have a folder full of sound effects with three filetypes in it from the Nintendo Gamecube game, Lost Kingdoms 2. SAM, which seems to be the audio file itself, PPS, which I guess is the script for the audio file, and a HJD file, which seems to be the directory and names of the sound effects. Can anyone help me convert/extract these? Searching has only brought up a couple other unanswered questions about the format ([here ](https://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=17&t=11581&p=95884&hilit=sam#p95884)and [here](https://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=17&t=11853&p=97731&hilit=sam#p97731)). [AudioKonverter](https://www.logipole.com/audiokonvertor-formats_en.htm)'s page says that it's a signed PCM raw audio file, but I don't know how reliable that is, and their program didn't work (and was horribly buggy).

Any help is appreciated. Thank you.

The audio is in Nintendo DSP format.

This script will extract the files from the .pps/.sam archives.

Thanks. What do I do with the *.vgmstream files though? VGMStream doesn't seem like it'll convert them.

I wonder why they used a different audio format here despite using DSP for all their other audio in the game.

Edit: It looks like I'm meant to put them into foobar2k and convert from there. Just for future reference, can I convert vgmstream files without having to drop in foobar?

Hi,

I did it that way because it was easier for me as I already had a script.  I don't know if you can convert them without Foobar, but it's easy enough anyway.

If I had more time I would have created them with a proper DSP header

No problem, I was just wondering as I'm still learning this stuff myself (so I don't ask so many questions here!). Thanks for the help.
