- Post Title: [REQUEST] DK 온라인 (korean client)

Hi guys,

I'm looking forward to get client of DK online (korean version). I already know there is a global version available at [https://dk.masanggames.com/?mid=DKONLINE_MAIN](https://dk.masanggames.com/?mid=DKONLINE_MAIN) , but it's quite outdated ( reached only episode 3), while korean version is the most updated. 

The korean website is this [http://dk.masangsoft.com/](http://dk.masangsoft.com/) , I got automatically redirect to the global site and can not access to the korean one ( I managed to go with waybackmachine but client it's now available), and also using a VPN, I don't have the skills to get the downloader link without register ( that will require a I-PIN). 
Is there anyone capable of getting client or downloader from kr website? 

Thanks in advance, 
Drawing
