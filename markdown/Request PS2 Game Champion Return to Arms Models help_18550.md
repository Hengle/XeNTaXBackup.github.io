- Post Title: Request PS2 Game Champion Return to Arms Models help

Hi I found these scripts that are for the PS2 Game "Champions Return to Arms" on this page 
[http://ps23dformat.wikispaces.com/Champ ... rn+to+Arms](http://ps23dformat.wikispaces.com/Champions+Return+to+Arms)

I am interested in the NPC character models in the game, mainly Firiona Vie, Sylea and Natasla

however the scripts seems to be incomplete or needs a little improvement as the 3ds model it creates leaves some parts of the mesh in the wrong places, and I have not been able to do anything with the texture converter

can someone take a look at the scripts and the Character file I've attached and maybe improve or fix it to create complete mesh with texture?

ugh. this animal code stuff again? i converted one of those already. i don't wanna do another tho. it's exhausting. this script needs an entire rewrite and further snooping, again. the author of this stuff is a damn moron. it doesn't work and it's not readable to improve it.
