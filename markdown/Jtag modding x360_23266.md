- Post Title: Jtag modding x360

Been trying to mod as couple games , Boarderlands for one . I can unpack the file but all textures for characters are tiny. 100 x 100 or so. Again this is the xenon version. 
  Injustice is a game I'd love to mod. My dotxxx archive doesnt  take a dds injection . I've used mk9 mostly mod tools some unreal engine tools. I thought xpacker would be my best bet , I cant find any tutorial except one on his sf4 site. Sf4 or ssf4 ae I was able to recreate some fastoooo type mods. Again on console. The good obj days. 
   Any help would be appreciated,  "hack the planet".
