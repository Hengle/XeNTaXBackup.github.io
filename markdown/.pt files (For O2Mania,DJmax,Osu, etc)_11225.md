- Post Title: .pt files (For O2Mania,DJmax,Osu, etc)

I have .pt files that are used for some rhythm games. They are pattern/chart files just like .bms/.dwi/.sm files that layout the notes to hit during songs. I can't figure out how to get into these though. They seem to be formatted/encrypted in a weird way that other chart files aren't. So i am just wondering if anyone has knowledge of these files.

If the .pt is from DJMAX Online there are many converters from .pt to .bms, for example this one in .py

(I didn't test it but it should work)

If they are from DJMAX Trilogy i guess it won't work because the encryption changed i guess, if it's from Trilogy (which i suppose beecause Feel is from there, or DJMAX Ray can be also but i doubt it due to the name of the file) i  would like to know how you managed to open the .pak files.

Is how you can extract everything for trilogy. Also that tool only supports 5 and 7 Key so most of the charts would not even convert if it was compatible. It does not work anyway. It wouldn't make sense to encrypt these .pt files when they already encrypted the entire data into .pak. The rest of the files are all accessible (music,pics,configs,etc)

I have no actual clue on how to read them since i don't know naything about coding, but i it doesn't make sense at all how you can extract the files and you can't import them back :C

The file is encrypted.
here the decrypted version of you file.

the format is different from the one know IN DJMax online. it can support more stuff in it. Its used in DJMax technika too and maybe on some DJMax portable versions.

have you planned to use them back in trilogy?

I have the same issue as Manwell. The .pt (pattern) files from DJMAX Ray are somewhat encrypted. See attached:
Dark Lightning (http://www.mediafire.com/download/z3q24 ... _6key_3.pt)
Seolaim Part 2 (http://www.mediafire.com/download/xiutn ... _6key_3.pt)

I was just wondering is there a way or a script to convert it to a readable .bms (pattern) file?
Example: http://www.mediafire.com/download/7rxv2 ... MVC_7n.bms

TwisteroidAmbassador's converter doesn't seem to work on those newly encrypted files but it would be good if it can be played in o2mania, lr2 as well. BTW, .bms files can be created/edited by BMx Sequence Editor.

Hellow, 

I decrypted one of your files,
[http://djmax.shadosoft-tm.com/darklight ... y_3_dec.pt](http://djmax.shadosoft-tm.com/darklightning_6key_3_dec.pt)
it seem to be encrypted with the same code than all the other DJMax
Trilogy, PSP games, and technika pt files.

I also tried to open it on my Technika 2/3 editor and it seem to be kind of same format


I'll try if I have time to put it in my unpacker or maybe you can email me some files you'd like to decrypt.
