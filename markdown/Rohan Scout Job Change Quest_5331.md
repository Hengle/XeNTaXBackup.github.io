This Rohan guide will tell you on how to change from Archer into a Scout. The Scout Job Change Quest  is divided into four parts and is quite difficult, chances are, you will need extra help from your guild mates and friends. But at the end of this Rohan Quest and you changed into a scout, it is definitely worth it.

Rohan Quest First Part: Find a Statue
Rohan Quest Second Part: Kill Berg
Rohan Quest Third Part: Locate Felix Box
Rohan Quest Fourth Part: Kill Morvols

Rohan Scout Job Change Quest Requirements

    * Level 50 Archer (Half Elf)
    * Solo Rohan Quest (you should not be in a party)

Rohan Scout Job Change Quest

1. The Scout Job Change Quest starts at Kai’non. Talk to Senecca. She will ask you to go find a statue

2.  The Crumbling Statue can be found at the center of Gray Down Tower(Elf Map). Outside the tower are Ekzine monsters, just make your way passed through them. Click on the statue.

3. You have finished Quest1 in the Scout Job Change Quest. Go back to Senneca in Kainon to receive the second part of the Rohan quest. You will get a level 1 dagger. Use this dagger to kill a BERG monster, one will do. Once you have changed your job as a Rohan scout, you will be mastering the melee attack skills using a dagger.

4. You can find the Berg at the Akhma Cave. Also, Berg is the mini-boss in the Human Village coordinates (E-2) or (Pine Plateau at coordinates F-8 F-9), you need to kill it with the dagger given to you.

5. After your successfully kill Berg, return to Senecca. You have accomplished the second part of the Scout job Change Quest. On the third part,  Senecca will give you a key to open the Felix box

6.  The Felix box can be found inside Black Dragon Sanctuary (Geizan Map). This is the most difficult part because there are lots of monsters inside the sanctuary and this is not exactly your Rohan race territory. I suggest that you party up with a friend and just leave the party when you are about to open the box. Go inside the sanctuary and head straight then take two right path whenever you see a split path. After the two split paths, head forward and you will a room with flame spites and monsters.

7. You need to open the Felix box to accomplish the third part of Scout Job Change Quest
