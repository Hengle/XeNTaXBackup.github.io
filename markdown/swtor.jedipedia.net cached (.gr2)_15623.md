here is a Noesis python script to open the gr2 files from your browser's cache 


 fmt_SWTOR_Jedipedia_gr2.zip
(820 Bytes) Downloaded 129 times


supports mesh and UVs

the idea here is go to this webpage and search for the character you want
[https://swtor.jedipedia.net/en/npc](https://swtor.jedipedia.net/en/npc)

after the character page loads clear your browser's cache to make it easier to find the files

then refresh the page and click on "Click to load 3d" under "Appearance"

after the model and textures load you can find the files in your browser cache using
ChromeCacheView from here if you use Chrome,
[http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/chrome_cache_view.html](http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/chrome_cache_view.html)
there are other programs linked there if you use a different browser.

the cached textures are png files


example
[https://swtor.jedipedia.net/en/npc/impe ... l-droid-20](https://swtor.jedipedia.net/en/npc/imperial-medical-droid-20)


the purpose of this script is to speed up finding that character you want,
i think it is easier to search jedipedia than to go through the game files
and they seem to keep their database updated regularly too so props to them
