- Post Title: NinjaRipper - Textures messed up

Hi there!

I've been trying to rip a car, the model turns out great but the textures are all over the place.

This is what it looks like after importing it into 3ds max.


It needs to look like this so yeah it's not exactly right at the moment haha.


I know my way around 3d editors but 3ds max is fairly new for me so If anyone can guide me into the right direction, or maybe im doing something wrong with ninjaripper.
