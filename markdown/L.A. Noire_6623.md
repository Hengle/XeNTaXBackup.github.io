Sorry I can't understand you. What is "ajuidar"?

I hope together we will find where texts and fonts are located and will able to translate the game to our languages.
Stupid Rockstar doesn't make Russian, Polish etc translations for their games while the most of other publishers do. 
only multi5.

That's easy, also not tested in game: out.wad.360
At the end of the file, you can see the name of the files. Find the "string" string to find the texts. (I think this is also the beginning of the text files.)

Thx, see texts now. gonna try  replacing one string and launching the game.
but what about fonts? For Russian translation I need to paint these stupid cyrillic characters 

and how to convert texts into "readable" format? 

translating in HEX is very stupid activity.

Yeah, need editor. The text use UTF8, so every accents need 2 character place.

Some news:
- the out.wad.360 contain texts in UTF8 format, but mostly tutorial strings. The other strings are compressed?!
- The Naked City... DLC contain only big.360 files. But where are the texts? The basic game already contain the texts of this DLC?!

Apparently they couldn't fit all the crime cases onto the already massive 3 discs so chances are the text for the extra mission are on the discs and all the other stuff is found in the DLC.

Good news! PS3 version has the same structure as 360 one.


and one more question, how to recognise TGA file in out.wad?

the problem is, TGA format doesn't have 3-character header in the beginning. so how to recognise it in that mess of code?
i want to find textures of fonts, copy them from archive (in hex), paint Russian characters and insert them back. but how to find them...
e.g. PNG format has PNG header in the beginning of the file, so i found 2 png files in this archive without any problems..but they're useless


> Reply from michalss

> Is there allready know the way how to extract the texts ?

not yet... but you can edit some of them directly in out.wad using hex editor. 
i think the changes will appear in the game if you change text in hex.

Yes, texts are in root.atb file.

I's quite a messy file, i took a quick look at it and couldn't come up with nothing useful. 

Before each text block there is the size of the text. Not useful at all so...

If we had another sample of these .atb files we could compare'em both to see what differs.

Thanks for the sample.

The .big.360 files are different from the .wad?

You can't repack the wad at the moment.

EDIT:The root.atb file seem to have only the cases texts, i couldn't find the menu\subtitles texts there..

[http://dl.dropbox.com/u/1237855/unpack_big.zip](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/1237855/unpack_big.zip)
.big.ps3 unpacker. Source code included. 
Replace zlib with LZX decompressor to unpack .big.360 (my own LZX library is extremely ugly, so I didn't include it) 

Filenames are stripped from archives. Instead filenames used crc32 of name. names can be reconstructed, if someone find name/resource list.

Most of the resources are serialized objects. I have found serializer initialization in the code, but I need to write .idc to extract all registered names, types and offset (~2600 objects and ~10500 fields registered). Maybe, something useful can be found in the Havok 5.5 User Guide, ch. 3 (Serialization).

When you say replace the zlib decompressor with a LZX one should I just replace the zlib.h with LZX.h?

Something like that. You can use your favorite LZX decompressor (e.g. xcompress.lib)
I'm using piece of code, ripped from the cabextract sources.

You guys are making a good progress!
Keep going  
waiting for repacker

now what about texture format (*.ps3tex)?

.big.ps3 unpacker. Source code included. 
Replace zlib with LZX decompressor to unpack .big.360 (my own LZX library is extremely ugly, so I didn't include it) 

Filenames are stripped from archives. Instead filenames used crc32 of name. names can be reconstructed, if someone find name/resource list.

Most of the resources are serialized objects. I have found serializer initialization in the code, but I need to write .idc to extract all registered names, types and offset (~2600 objects and ~10500 fields registered). Maybe, something useful can be found in the Havok 5.5 User Guide, ch. 3 (Serialization).

Here is the unpacking procedure of my tool:

```
var
wad,ext:tfilestream;
filesize,filepos,nfiles,filenamepos,filenamesize:integer;
pos,i,i2,tx,other:integer;
buf:pchar;
fname,path:string;
begin
opendialog1.Execute();  other:=0;
wad:=tfilestream.Create(opendialog1.filename,fmopenread);
pos:=4; filesize:=0; filepos:=0; nfiles:=0; filenamesize:=0; tx:=0;
path:=getfolder(opendialog1.FileName);

wad.Position:=pos;
wad.Read(nfiles,4);

writeln(filelist,inttohex(nfiles,10));


inc(pos,8);

Memo1.Lines.Add('Unpacking...\Extraindo...');
memo1.Lines.Add('');
for i:=1 to nfiles do
  begin
    application.ProcessMessages;
  wad.Position:=pos;
  wad.Read(filepos,4);
  inc(pos,4);
  wad.Read(filesize,4);
  inc(pos,8);
  end;

filenamepos:=filepos+filesize;
pos:=$0c;
forcedirectories(path);
progressbar1.Max:=nfiles;
for i:=1 to nfiles do
  begin

  wad.Position:=pos-4;
  wad.Read(other,4);
  writeln(filelist,inttohex(other,10));

  application.ProcessMessages;
  progressbar1.Position:=i;
  wad.Position:=pos;
  wad.Read(filepos,4);
  inc(pos,4);
  wad.Read(filesize,4);
  inc(pos,8);

  //extrair nomes dos arquivos...
  wad.Position:=filenamepos;
  wad.Read(filenamesize,2);
  inc(filenamepos,2);

  fname:='';

  for i2:=1 to filenamesize do
    begin
    wad.Position:=filenamepos;
    wad.Read(tx,1);
    write(filelist,char(tx));
    if tx=$2f then tx:=$5c;
    fname:=fname+char(tx);
    inc(filenamepos);
    end;

 //nome extraido. extraindo arquivo.
 memo1.Lines.Add('Unpacking\Extraindo...'+extractfilename(fname));

  wad.Position:=filepos;
  buf:=allocmem(filesize);
  wad.Read(buf^,filesize);
// showmessage(path+extractfilepath(fname));
 forcedirectories(path+extractfilepath(fname));
 ext:=tfilestream.create(path+fname,fmcreate);
 writeln(filelist,path+fname);
 ext.Write(buf^,filesize);
 ext.Free;
 freemem(buf);
 end;
progressbar1.Position:=0;
memo1.Lines.Add('');
memo1.Lines.Add('All Files Unpacked\Todos os Arquivos Extraidos');
wad.free;
end;
```


I also coded a function to extract all the english texts from the root.atb file. 

I attached the .txt that it creates.

Great Work,
Are you think this are all texts ? Can you give me a bit explanation of the format please ?
I should only translate the texts and this tags "[]" should remain right ? I guess it is time in the video secvention ?? 

What lang did you use to make the unpacker ? And are you think you would be able to repack that file as well ?

thx

Something like that. You can use your favorite LZX decompressor (e.g. xcompress.lib)
I'm using piece of code, ripped from the cabextract sources.

Can you please post complete unpacker with all libs together ? thx

What format? The texts or the .wad?

I used Delphi. Yes it's possible to create a repacker but we gotta find a way to edit what's inside the wad (like the texts).

> Reply from michalss

Well, if you're talking about the .wad files then yes, despite what i said i created one but i couldn't test it like i wanted so no point in releasing a tool that might or might not work.

No, these aren't all the texts. Just what is inside the root.atb.

There is a ID of 4 bytes before each kind of text (like 0B2C8302 for english strings), i used these id's to extract the text out just for fun.

I care only abou the texts, nothing else, are you think there is a good possibility to make a repacker for text files only ? thx

Not the textures are the problem (ps3 textures handleable, x360 almost), but the texts. Until not editable all texts, no reason to working on textures.

hmmm it's very interesting, but I don't need change the text only need access to the textures to do some changes .

Finding a way to edit the texts must be quite difficult (pack / unpack, A Rockstar does not seem to like to translate their games and does not like the others to translate because it gets very difficult text editing). Also, once found, must be very hard work to translate a game with so many texts to edit.

(I also use a translator to write here,...)

I'm pretty sure it is well worth it to translate this game.  I dont care about some models and textures, i care about the texts, that is main important thing on the game i guess.

EDIT : On this forum ppl care about the models and textures, but i would like to know why? What is the main reason ? You want to modify the game for what purpose? For me it is just a huge waste of time. Ppl should really focus on texts from the games, coz my opinion is, that is the main reason why i would like to mod some game.

no sir, I have been misunderstood. Do not want to pack / unpack the textures, unpack only for my projects.
On translation, this is a good game to translate but I think it is hard work because you have to pack / unpack texts, translate thousands of words and uploading.
I've seen in recent months has been almost impossible in games like GTA IV Rockstar: Ballad of Gay Tony and TLAD or Midnght Club or Red Dead Redemption  so I think to be very complicated.

example: PS3_GAME \ USRDIR \ final \ ps3 \ out.wad \ out \ trunk \ characters \ notebook \ notebook_01.trunk.ps3 or example alpha_circle.ps3tex ? Is that my limitations as a programmer, must add my limitations with the language ...

No matter, I'll find how to open it. I do not want to waste people's time.

the textures are in .gtf format.
use gtf2dds.exe for umpack, and dds2gtf.exe for repack.

I just want to edit subtitles/texts. Please create an unpacker/packer if you can.

Bump. The PC version has been released an the current tools released for the console versions are not compatible with the PC files. Took a quick look at them, they do not seem to be encrypted. Anyone else look at them?

It's out now in North America. November 11th is the European release. FYI to those who are getting it on Steam, you'll need to run Steam as admin for the game to work. Steam has a problem running games as administrator.

Just wanted to say how excited I am about this forum. I learned about XeNTax through a thread I posted in GTAForums.

[http://www.gtaforums.com/index.php?showtopic=492471](http://www.gtaforums.com/index.php?showtopic=492471)

It is awesome to see that there are people who are just as excited as I am to work on modding this game. I am 37 years old and I have been working with computers since I was 9 years old. Unfortunately I have never coded or done anything real professional except hardware and software installation and trouble shooting. But I would love to learn or even help financially those who have the talent to mod. In other words I want to help however I can. I absolutely love this game. I have never been so enthralled by an open world like LA Noire. It is a the most beautiful game I have ever seen. If I was a modder and I had a dream open world to play with I think it would be LA Noire. Its exciting and massive in scope. There is so much potential for something incredible. I want to help make it happen. 

If there is anything I can do please let me know. Thanks!!

judging from the link you gave, you're talking about the pc version?

i made a thread for the pc version of la noire a few threads down, so if you have anything pc related, post it in there.

as for how you can help, ask gamerzworld if he can give you a link to that program he's talking about and post that link here.

i've played the pc version about half way through now and i've a pretty good gauge of what can and cannot be modded. i think it's possible to assign different models for body and weapon. for example, giving phelps and npcs different clothes.

.big.ps3 unpacker. Source code included. 
Replace zlib with LZX decompressor to unpack .big.360 (my own LZX library is extremely ugly, so I didn't include it) 

Filenames are stripped from archives. Instead filenames used crc32 of name. names can be reconstructed, if someone find name/resource list.

Most of the resources are serialized objects. I have found serializer initialization in the code, but I need to write .idc to extract all registered names, types and offset (~2600 objects and ~10500 fields registered). Maybe, something useful can be found in the Havok 5.5 User Guide, ch. 3 (Serialization).
I'll quote it to bring it to the top. Perhaps the PC version is using LZX like the 360? Would explain the lack of support by the tool.

i'm trying to replace the bodies of the characters. for example, i'd like to replace one of the suits phelps wears with the uniform he starts the game with. would this require actual repacking or could it be done through tinkering with memory address?

from my limited experience, there's always a text based file responsible for cataloging and referencing different assets within the package. is that typically the case with console games or are they constructed differently? because they seem difficult to mod. is that more to do with data encryption?

I heard the game files are encrypted (on PC). The likely encryption scheme used is Blowfish. Decryption key is unknown at the moment.

Could you give us a link? I can't find it on google (it keeps showing me Dragon unpacker instead of this and unfortunately DU is not working for this files, at least on my PC).

it comes with dragon unpacker. what you do it open the file and it'll automatically switch to hyperirpper, after which you select all the files and attempt to rip them. it'll recognize some things like dds files and audio.

Problem are not big files in final/pc folder. Some contain compressed files (they are segmented - they can be uncompressed by using offzip - the main table is in the end of file, in xbox they use xbox lzx), some are not compressed (but also segmented), but main problem are files maincontent (it contains out.wad.pc and mouse.txt), cases (cases.big.pc) and dlc in main game folder (these files also contains text from game (i managed to get text from these files in xbox version)), and these files are encrypted by blowfish (i am 75% sure), i managed to get main.dll for gameshield from game exe, but i failed in getting the password out.

Thats does not sounds good at all, however would you be able to put the translated text back to X360 version at least, if PC is out of question right now?

Which is likely to be so, considering an average Live user's financial standing, and their desire to mod things.

They decrypted also the archives from files cases, maincontent and dlc and they inserted them into final/pc folder, where they belong. So translation is now possible.

PS: I've got some scripts and templates to unpack and edit the archives, so if there will be big interest I can put them here. But not for now, I promised to keep it for myself, until the game translation in our country will be finished and I'm also right now in big time pressure, co I can't translate them all and write sufficient guide (So yes, i was able to change the game text  ).

What about the models and texture files? I'd be interested in shooping, or having someone shoop Cole and his buddies' face textures as the ones that came with it were low-rez.

So does this mean that we can now edit textures and stuff ingame? I'd like to put some lulzy billboards instead of the Cola King crap.

Awesome! As soon as you will be able to give this scripts, please, do it. You're not the only one who wants to translate this awesome game 

P.S. What language are you translating into?

Models and sound mods, perhaps. If only that we can crack the former.

Any chance for Unpacker/Re-packer for the PC version?

There are many fans of this game who want to translate it but for now i see that no one is working to create a tool(s) so the game archives can be opened normally and the text, textures can be translated/edited. 

I read all the pages in this thread and nothing about the PC version (a way to open the game archives or something)

Respect all the guys here in XeNTaX for their work and for helping us and i'll wait if someone can help us (the PC modders/translators) to translate the game.

Thanks in advance.

apparently that kramla guy had something, but he left and isn't answering any pms. i assume he's busy translating. 

seriously, do you get money for a translation or something? why does everyone want to do it? i'd rather edit the game itself. model replacements, textures, etc.

I wrote Python scripts for unpacking PC/PS3 WADs and BIGs. And I will try to write scripts for packing it now. It'll take some time. Also we need a tool working with attribute files (ATB), I have some progress in this direction too.

That is great news mate. Dont need any gui or something, just to make text repackable. Let me know if you need example files from X360 version later on, i will post them ASAP 

Thx again

Nope, the notebook textures are in the out.wad.pc package. I haven't opened the bigs, though, well since the tools for them aren't out yet.

You'll have to get the SKIDROW crack first, as they have the decrypted wad and cases files.

i just looked at the case file again, it's only 10mb. is the decrypted version significantly bigger? could you upload it in a rar or something? i'd appreciate that a lot cause the prospect of downloading the huge cracked version from skidrow is a little daunting. still at something like 50 percent on the last file.

For information.

Please correct me if i'm wrong. For translation we need 2 crack 2 files, 1 file like (menu and others are somewhere in out.wad) - we have repacker, rest text is in cases.big file.
So basically we need wad tool which is done and also Big Repacker tool to repack big files + for translation also need text file repacker, not sure what files are correct one, since i have not seen the extracted big file yet.

Interesting part is if we wont have SKNDROW group than there wont be any files cracked/encrypted, so it is a paradox because without the warez scene there would be none

We need WAD and BIG packers and ATB packer. However not only cases.big contains texts, so almost everyone BIG contains ATB files. Currently I rewrite my WAD/BIG tools in C++, this process will take some time. After that I will try to write packers that we need.

Yeah, but that only unpacks things. What's more lulzy is to put the hacked files back into the game.

Yes, but that will be more complicated. apart from the difficulty to extract and package the files, you need specific tools such as import models in 3DS Max. Someone should make a script.

At least, I would like to see models of vehicles.

It is a problem with your PC or tool? I tried but my pc is slow and would not start but I made a screen capture of the load. I think the tool works, it may be failure of the PC.

I'm using 3D Ripper DX 1.8.1, and all I ended up with is the game being stuck on synchronizing. The "Ready to capture" message does appear, though.

That would be great if you or someone else really success with repackers. This game really deserve to be translate into many diff. languages. So good luck to you and i hope you manage it very soon 

Dont really get ppl why they want to mod textutes and models or such a things, does not make any sence to me at all. What is the point if you dont ever understand it on the first place??

It's mostly because some people are just plain unsatisfied with leaving the game vanilla. And besides, some of the textures seemed blurry (like the character faces).

I don't think that ripping models and textures are complicated process. Besides, I'm already working with textures in PS3 format and converted it to DDS and vice versa. I will release tools somehow later.

Yeah, but we'll have to look for some logic/script files for that to be enabled, or find some way to hook into the already Fort-Knox'd EXE (being that it's protected by GameShield, and that certain hooks like the DirectX PIX won't work).

i think 3D Models have "trM#" header, textures are dds

FSBs are trivial enough, as most ripping utils can handle it.

all extracted file will have the filename with "nmbr_offset_crc.dat" 
for uncompressed files and "nmbr_offset_crc.sges" for compressed files.

i think 3D Models have "trM#" header, textures are dds
audio files are *.fsb files, use fsb_mpeg to convert them (http://hcs64.com/vgm_ripping.html)
Code: Select all#

# script for QuickBMS http://quickbms.aluigi.org

# goto header
goto -4
get szFileTable long

math START -= szFileTable
goto START

# read File table header
get unk1 long
get numFiles long

for x = 0 < numfiles

# read entry

# build FileName

You're awesome bro but can anyone post script for Maincontent file?

You don't need it. Just simply use SKIDROW crack which already contains uncompressed and decrypted files.

I downloaded it but after unpack I have few files and some ypatcher.exe which after executing it shows me "Runtime error 216 at 00403F5C". Should uninstall the game, run this ypatcher then install the game again?

We don't need it because my script can unpack compressed data (SEGS).

I can't say anything about it because I downloaded a torrent release with already decrypted files. I didn't do anything manually.

In the process. I don't have a much time. There are some little stuff that I still not understand.

No, I don't. There are two links: first is the script that I mean, second is collection of my thoughts about ATB file structure. You should use the first link.

And it will unpack Maindata file? I tried and it didn't work.

I forgot, it shows me error in command "import" in argument 3 in line 1. BTW I asked for unpacked by skidrow files not a script for quickbms.

Here are steps needed to unpack cases.big.pc:
1) Install Python 2.7 from [http://python.org/ftp/python/2.7.2/python-2.7.2.msi](http://python.org/ftp/python/2.7.2/python-2.7.2.msi) to C:\Python27, for example.
2) Download the my script and place it to: C:\tmp
3) Launch the command line and change the working directory to: C:\tmp
4) Then launch: python unpack_big.py C:\Games\L.A.Noire\final\pc\cases.big.pc > result.txt
After that you will get uncompressed files from cases.big.pc in the 'entries' folder. Besides, you can get unstructured files from  some archives, for example, reftextures_populated.big.pc.

Just forget about Maindata, etc. As I said before after applying the SKIDROW crack you will get all needed files in the 'final' folder.

Sorry, but editing is still not supported. It will take some time to research the repacking process. I don't have much time to do it for now. Just wait a bit.

That's all what the tool can do for now. We'll have to wait before proper filename and repacking support is implemented.

In other news, there are also a bunch of TRM files on the out.wad.pc archive. Same header as the ones found on the big files.

repacking should be easy, because the game loads extracted files ^^
it just needs the proper filename+path, i tried to trace the hash function, but i'm not good in this stuff
i came to the function 00D2B410 (skidrow crack), it calculates the crc32 of every filename

some progress:
[http://www.imagebanana.com/view/hxdpjov0/971.jpg](http://www.imagebanana.com/view/hxdpjov0/971.jpg)
i converted the file 971.trm from characters.big.pc to obj, 
"trM#" contains infos for textures, mesh and bone offsets, "ptM#" are the bones

Nice... Did you manage to get the UVW maps correctly? And I'm looking forward to extracting Cole Phelps from the game, too.

For those who want to play with textures I attached two tools that doing conversion between ps3tex (gtf) <-> dds.
[http://dl.dropbox.com/u/11973972/texconv.zip](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/11973972/texconv.zip)
Also some extracted files contains textures with invalid header. I can write a tool that will fix it if you need it.

In the Xbox 360 version they use an another compression algorithm (LZX). I need to write a python module that will work with it.

that button is only for pc version, i made it for debugging while working on the decompression

segs/sges = segmented compressed file, they can be anything, PC/PS3 uses Zlib, x360 uses lzx

Hmm great got it working. Just very interesting how it is used and why PS3 and X360 are not the same. But its ok what ever it will work i'm glad it does  
- Would be also able to do repack for X360 files after you done all your todos?
- Would you be able to do also replack tool for atb files as well for X360 ?

I just want to say you are really great u doing it for ppl because it really worth to transalte this game into all langs and special for me and millions of other yr implementation for X360.

maybe xbox is not allowing zlib or whatever,
i could already repack these files, but i never wrote any repacker and first i want real filenames ^^

with real filenames you don't need to repack anything, the games loads them from "installdir/..." where lanoire.exe is
example filename:
intermediate/chunks/animation/conversations/ua008/ua008_00_01_dispatch_any_available_unit_citizen_reports_a_459.chunk

i found also some other stuff in lanoire.exe, -dx11 starts the game in dx11 mode, but crashs ^^
and i think it has an hidden editor,

editorui/interesting_location.dae
editorui/traffic_light_indicator.dae
models/designers_tools/invisible_prop_indicator.dae
editorui/portalroom.dae
editorui/spawnedglobalactor.dae
editorui/game_location.dae

PS: i updated my previous post with Beta2&Beta 3 of the unpacker, with support for PS3 and files bigger than 4 GB

maybe you shouldn't try that button ? i made it only for debugging the decompression, it decompresses a input file sges (pc, little endian) to out.dat

progress:
i found the hash function ^^

VB.NET code:

```

        If str.Length <= 0 Then Return 0

        Dim bCmp As Byte
        Dim hash As UInt32 = &HFFFFFFFF

        For i As Integer = 0 To str.Length - 1

            bCmp = CByte(Asc(str(i)))

            If CByte(bCmp - &H41) <= &H19 Then
                bCmp += &H20
            End If

            hash = crc32b_table(CByte(hash And &HFF) Xor bCmp) Xor (hash >> 8)

        Next i

        Return Not hash
    End Function
```

crc32b_table = 256 * 4 Byte table at 0xF741D8 in cracked exe

now it's time to create a filenametable ^^

if you check "decompress *.sges (Zlib)" then the extracted file *.sges will be decompressed, you don't need to decompress it again.
it's a little design bug that the decompressed file still have *.sges extension, my tool builds the filename before decompressing.

well, then see if I understand correctly. You can decompress files  BIG  in SGES files but maybe I misunderstood and I think you can decompress files in other files SEGS texture or 3D models. Click the tab sometimes and sometimes not, I've tried it both ways

I successfully got the hash that corresponds to the hash of extracted chunk.
Here is the script that calculates CRC32 value of a string: [http://pastebin.com/JakBdBcL](http://pastebin.com/JakBdBcL)

That is:
> python crc32.py intermediate/chunks/movies/logos.bik.chunk
intermediate/chunks/movies/logos.bik.chunk => 0xc2216ace

Voila!

Great Work mate. I hope you gonna finnishit soon  . Also thank you for X360 support, that is most important for me and i beleive for millions of others 
Once you fininsh it i have to send you some Czech beer

> Good job! Where did you find some file names?
i think all filenames can be found in *.atb files, but they are the real files, LANoire.exe converts them

example: 
real filename: characters/dead_bodies/pt007_kenneth_temple.dae
converted filename: intermediate/chunks/characters/dead_bodies/pt007_kenneth_temple.chunk

it could take a while to dump all filenames (over 40.000)

here some of the dlc, my current tool already loads a filenames.txt und displays/extracts the correct name

```
intermediate/chunks/attribute/root.dlc.dlc1.atb.chunk
intermediate/chunks/attribute/root.dlc.dlc1.AT004.atb.chunk

Hey Falo, A doubt. the chunk´s files  Are containers for files. DAE and DDS or simply: DAE with another extension.?
With the translations sometimes do not understand the half. By the way, know means that your nickname in Spanish ,...? You do not want you to know ...

Are the DDS files for the characters embedded in the TRM chunks? Oh, and what about the model files? Are they easy enough to be opened in Max, or better yet, make custom peds, weapons and even new vehicles? *thinks about modders making ricer shit in LAN*

Good news, guys, I have successfully modified root.atb.ps3 and added a custom russian text for a PS3 version of the game. And it works too!  Here is the video:

Now we are able to translate the game in any language.

No, I can't. I edited the file manually without tools. And for repack I used caws's WAD tool. If I will have spare time, I will try to write tools to do so.

i found also some other stuff in lanoire.exe, -dx11 starts the game in dx11 mode, but crashs ^^
and i think it has an hidden editor,

editorui/interesting_location.dae
editorui/traffic_light_indicator.dae
models/designers_tools/invisible_prop_indicator.dae
editorui/portalroom.dae
editorui/spawnedglobalactor.dae
editorui/game_location.dae

PS: i updated my previous post with Beta2&Beta 3 of the unpacker, with support for PS3 and files bigger than 4 GB

This is indeed very interesting!

No, I can't. I edited the file manually without tools. And for repack I used caws's WAD tool. If I will have spare time, I will try to write tools to do so.

Where can I find this tool to repack?

Если вас интересуют ps3tex текстуры, то нужно просто ее преобразовать в DDS при помощи утилиты gtf2dds. Я, кажется, ее выкладывал несколько страниц назад. Если же интересуют текстуры в mtr-чанках, то утилиты нет, я хотел написать, но не было времени. Там всего лишь нужно выделить ее из mtr-чанка и подправить заголовок. Я делал это вручную, это не трудно.  Ну и для самих текстур-чанков тоже самое.

If you have a PC version of the game you have textures in a DDS format already.

reftextures_characters.big.*
reftextures_populated.big.*
populated.lowlodenv.big.*

all 3 doesn't have a filetable (numfiles = 0), that's why script & tool doesn't work

textures are .dds in pc version, but they are build into "trM#" files, i know how to extract them, but that requires a new tool / script.

i don't get why you all want a translation, the game supports already English (UK/US), German, Italian, French, Spanish, Russian and Japanese, all texts are in all 7 languages

```
start LANoire.exe -language English/French/Italian/German/Spanish/Japanese/Russian
```

there just seem to be a bug that the game uses English text when you choose Russian, but pictures are loaded from "/russian/" folder

Maybe because most ppl cannot speak this languages well. For me is to translate game making more sence then do something wiht models or textures which is just waste of time. And if ppl dont understant the game why i would mod some models , it does not make any sense to me at all. Thats why 90% of ppl here want text repackers.

I'm sure you already knew that there are more than 7 languages worldwide, so why the question? Isn't it obvious? It's not like people have nothing better to do than translate the same languages that already exist within the game... 
Of course those 7 languages you mention are the ideal marketing approach for selling something but players do exist beyond the profiting potential. Not to be rude, but since you asked why, take a look here:

I can understand that people want a game in their native language, but in opinion i'm german and i only need english, because most of the time a translation is not good and much better when you play it in english, i'm not a big fan of translations if an english version is available.

> Can you tell us how to force game to use extracted files? Because you say that repacking is not needed.
place the files in the same folder as LANoire.exe, 
example: "C:\Games\LANoire\LANoire.exe" then "C:\Games\LANoire\intermediate\..."
but this only works with the real name, not the generated names.

text is in *.atb files, this is compiled binary script format, use an hex editor like "MadEdit" for translations, to unpack it we have to write a decompiler/compiler

*.dae are the raw source files rockstar uses, but the finished game uses a custom model format inside of "trM#" files

Good work everyone. I see there is much progress being made. My question is from a very limited understanding of what is being said. I just wanted to know if someone can use these tools, that all of you have made available, to mod the game itself rather than just change the language. Will these tools help, if for instance, I wanted to make weapons available while just driving around town? Or if I wanted to be able to press a button and enter hand to hand combat at any point while I was walking around the city? Do we need different tools for that? Is that even possible at this point? I am wondering about the PC version specifically. Thanks!!

forget about translation and answer the question: can you write soft for porting subtitles from PC into XBOX360?

Like this is impossible to do, since PC and X360 would have different of text measurements. Thats why you need atb repacker and BIG repacker as well. If you dont then too bad. I'm still waiting for Big Packer and ATB repacker to make it possible to work on X360.

Now it is possible to write the script that will be doing a reverse process. If I will have a free time I will do it.

Thanks a lot, man. Can't wait to make this script. And 1 question, if after you make this script what can happen when I put back a PS3 strings into pc version (that one you provided cause in pc version (probably) you removed some strings and left only russian).

> I'm sure you already knew that there are more than 7 languages worldwide, so why the question? Isn't it obvious? It's not like people have nothing better to do than translate the same languages that already exist within the game...
Of course those 7 languages you mention are the ideal marketing approach for selling something but players do exist beyond the profiting potential.
I can understand that people want a game in their native language, but in opinion i'm german and i only need english, because most of the time a translation is not good and much better when you play it in english, i'm not a big fan of translations if an english version is available.
Can you tell us how to force game to use extracted files? Because you say that repacking is not needed.
place the files in the same folder as LANoire.exe, 
example: "C:\Games\LANoire\LANoire.exe" then "C:\Games\LANoire\intermediate\..."
but this only works with the real name, not the generated names.
who can write clearly and distinctly the structure of files containing subtitle, text menu ... and how to unpack it?
edit in programs:
DDS = photoshop(free analog gimp)
DAE = photoshop(free analog blender)
text is in *.atb files, this is compiled binary script format, use an hex editor like "MadEdit" for translations, to unpack it we have to write a decompiler/compiler

*.dae are the raw source files rockstar uses, but the finished game uses a custom model format inside of "trM#" files

Hi Falo,

Can you please fiinish pack for BIG files on X360? I would really need it. We can also chat about reward if that will speed the proccess? If you want pls contact me on PM wiht your ICQ, MSN or Skype details.

Thank you

Fonts are in out.wad -> out\fonts\
They can be generated via BMFont: http://www.angelcode.com/products/bmfont/

thanks! I want to add polish characters(or replace existing characters), I must edit only dds files? And can you tell where are language files?

No, you must not. You need to create a new similar font in the BMFont with the Polish character set. Textures will be created then automatically.

All localized texts are located in ATB files.

Hi, we've just finished our translation of the game ([http://la.noire.cz/index.html](http://la.noire.cz/index.html)), so if there will be any interest i can post in few days the tools I have. But as I can see here, the extraction tool is better than mine, because mine is much more programeer's version (without file names, just numbered files). Also my repack tools are done only for some of the big files in pc version and only for packing back the texts, fonts etc.

I think it will be better to finish the tool here than use mine to mod the game. So if there is needed the help with repacking the archives, texts, font or something back to files and archives i can share what i know about it.

Well, sorry if I posted this on the wrong section, but I'm not that arsed to make a new topic about it and end up with no replies. But anyway, is it possible to put a custom model back into the game like in GTA? Mafia II was promising but afaik I haven't heard of any new news regarding models for that game.

i think it will not be posible because of complicate face animation, maybe it will, but without face expressions  

btw, i'm making detailed heads for each character (right-ingame, left-mywork):

Maybe, unless if the facial animation engine's just a glorified, bone-driven mocap of sorts. Making custom cars might be an easier goal, though.

No, you must not. You need to create a new similar font in the BMFont with the Polish character set. Textures will be created then automatically.

It is a lot of work. Is it possible to convert binary fnt to text fnt?

So the promised tools from me are here:

[http://www.wupload.com/file/2605715047/ ... -TOOLS.zip](http://www.wupload.com/file/2605715047/LANOIRE-TOOLS.zip)

It's based on scripts and templates for program 010 editor. For pack and unpack I used extarnal called compression algorithms from bms from aluigi (thanks). In folder "pc-text+font packer" is folder LANOIRE (path is defined in scripts - C:\LANOIRE) which is used for packing back text and fonts (for pc version with patch) (you need to insert there dlc big archives (all 9), out.wad.pc and cases.big.pc). To pack, the text must be edited in folders root and cases and dlc folders (dlc5,dlc6,dlc8) (.txt files, utf format) (fonts in out/fonts) and structure of it must be the same as it is unpacked by me (number of lines and also the new line character 0D0Ah must not be changed!). For pack you need to use scripts in the correct order (for root (gui) - 1 then 2) for cases (1-you can choose the cases texts you want to pack,2,3 (this will edit text in dlc archives - there are duplicit texts from cases and only dlc texts))

In folder "some tools" you will find some tools for unpacking the archives and templates for example to edit fonts. (unpackers are capable of extracting only some of the archives!) I will not include a guide for this one, sorry, it's up to you to understand it.

The tools are forbidden to use in another czech translation of this game!

I also made a xbox repacker, but it's not tested in real  I only compared the results with the original files and made unpack to be sure it works.

[http://www.wupload.com/file/2605903227/xbox-pack.zip](http://www.wupload.com/file/2605903227/xbox-pack.zip)

Use is the same as for pc version - put lanoire folder in the C:\ folder, add big.360 and wad.360 files in lanoire folder, edit text or fonts and then use scripts in correct order.

(for those that dont know how to use 010 editor scripts and some comments how to repack pc (xbox version)) :

When you open the archive, there is folder pc-text+font packer (xbox-pack), open it and inside is folder lanoire - put this folder in C:\ directory then inside this folder you will have folders cases and root, there are only english texts - replace them with translated ones and then go back to folder C:\lanoire\ (dont forget to insert here required big and wad files! (.pc or .360))
there are five scripts for program 010 editor - now you must to use script one for root-atb-importer and after it finishs close it and open script two root-wad-importer and apply it.

The same for cases scripts, there is only one difference, you can choose what txt files from folder C:\lanoire\cases\ will be used (less is faster) and after it finishes use script two for pack into big file (it will use external command line tool so it will be "flashing"). And then the last script 3 for dlc (only for pc).

(scripts are used without other opened support files)
Script can be used be clicking on the upper program bar where are the icons that are resembling pergamens - small paper like icons - on the right side of white ones is empty space for choosing the script - choose one you opened and then apply it by white one pergamen with green arrow and wait for finish  (it will take about 1 to 5 minutes to finish)  (it will write at the bottom of program script finished succesfuly)

Nice! Can't wait for the model/texture tools, too. Sure, translating things would be 'swell for those who need to play it in their own language, but it would be a lot better if we can do some enhancements or just plain fun to the game.

Yesterday I made a module that working with LZX compression algorithm and now I can deal with Xbox 360 archives. I will release my tools soon. They includes scripts to archive processing (BIG & WAD), ATB's text processing and texture processing. Besides, I plan to start working with 3D models.

i think it will not be posible because of complicate face animation, maybe it will, but without face expressions  

btw, i'm making detailed heads for each character (right-ingame, left-mywork):

if you are putting in the effort(excellent work btw), then you must have an inkling at least that it's possible?

btw, have you located where models are? so i can do replacement by changing file name?

Ped models are located in the characters.big.pc archive. We can do some simple switch-e-roo stuff on it, but we'll have to wait until Falo, Flatz or some kind lad manages to crack the TRM model format.

What I meant was rename one of the files to another. And I'm not sure about Kram's tools, either.

do you mean the falo unpacker? i am using it now. he says the game loads files directly from harddrive once you extract them and it has the proper name. however the change i have committed does not show in the game. what i did was experiment with cole phelps chunks from character.big.pc.

now i have the folder in the install directory ie. intermediate/chunks/characters...etc

but the changes are not taking effect.

Yep, still waiting for 'em. IDK why Boris of ENBSeries fame and the guy who made ZModeler were so egoistic about not modding the game.

What do you mean by egoistic, as in they were selfish about NOT modding the game, or selfish as in they're not sharing the mods.

The first answer to be specific. Just because R* was being dicks at porting the game doesn't mean that you won't be doing your part in making it better.

Yeah I agree, even though there my favorite Publisher, I have to agree they were a little bit dickish about porting LA Noire to PC, and not announcing that they were porting it to PC till 3 months after release making us think they were giving up on PC since it looks like they were not going to do a PC Port for their second game in a row, ala Red Dead Redemption. But it was a GREAT SURPRISE when they announced it, and the fact that they brought it OnLive has made up for it I would say.

not modding the game on principle? i've never heard of such a ridiculous thing. 

if i have gotten so popular at modding that i think i'm being clever by refusing to mod or claiming to refuse on principle when i was never going to mod something anyway, i think i wouldn't want to be that "good".

Even though I hate MW2, and even if I'm a bit disgusted at the "No Russian" mission, Boris cited it as a reason why he chose not to mod the said Call of Duty game, saying that it was a negative propaganda against Russians. He was even sarcastic at releasing the RE5 graphics mod that removed the coffee filter, so I think he was a bit emo about doing such things.

NINJA EDIT: Can anyone provide me a texture file from the PS3 version with the controller fonts? I'm making a Playstation buttons mod for the PC version, y'know. There's a pic of it in one of the previous pages here, but it's a JPEG and there's no alpha channel.

Sorry for the double-post, but here's what I did so far:

Thought of doing this especially for those who play LAN with a Playstation controller. It's pretty obvious that the onscreen joystick controls are for the 360, and I thought that it would be a bit confusing especially for interrogations if you're using a PS2/PS3 stick.





Somewhat inspired by Fabio206's [360 to PS2 Joypad Mod](http://www.gtaforums.com/index.php?showtopic=390877) for GTA IV.

You'll obviously have to use the X360 controller emu by Racer_S for non-Xbox devices to work. And if you have a PS2 controller lying around an adapter such as this, which costs around 5 dollars, or 200 pesos at a local electronics supply store, might do the trick for you:

[http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001AA ... B001AATQ0Y](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001AATQ0Y?ie=UTF8&tag=inproduction-20&link_code=as3&camp=211189&creative=373489&creativeASIN=B001AATQ0Y)
[http://www.cdrking.com/?mod=products&ty ... 4&main=145](http://www.cdrking.com/?mod=products&type=view&sid=2994&main=145)

And oh, you'll be needing the unencrypted out.wad.pc, a fixed 1.0 or 1.1 EXE, (and DLC files if you're going to play the bonus cases). The SKIDROW release group has one, but I won't be telling you where to get it - Google's your friend.

To install, use Caws' [L.A. Noire WAD Tool](http://www.mediafire.com/?t5ebjbbrnpn9r4p) to unpack the out.wad.pc file. Once unpacked, you'll see a new folder named out.wa on the final\pc directory. Navigate to that folder, double-click on out, go to fonts, and then paste the modded tutorial_font_0.dds file into that directory.

Then, on the WAD Tool, click on Repack WAD, and then find out.wad-filelist.txt. Click OK, and it should generate a new wad file, which you'll rename as out.wad.pc.

In any version of the game, you can delete or rename those files, and use the files from final\pc.

With Skidrow crack, the game already read the files from final\pc. With other versions, like THETA/Steam, you can move/delete the files from root, and put the equivalent files in final\pc:

Cases: cases.big.pc

DLC: dlc.dlc1.big.pc, dlc.dlc2.big.pc, dlc.dlc3.big.pc, dlc.dlc4.big.pc, dlc.dlc5.big.pc, dlc.dlc6.big.pc, dlc.dlc7.big.pc, dlc.dlc8.big.pc and dlc.dlc9.big.pc.

MainContent: out.wad.pc

You can get all these files from the L.A Noire DLC Addon by Skidrow.

I tried here and it worked.

Yes, you are partially right, but that's not what I'm asking for  I'm asking for blowfish key or any tool for extracting archives. Because version 1.1 on steam is crashing and Skidrow version runs fine, I want to check what is inside files in steam version, because all are different from retail version.

I'm not talking about cracking. I just want to know if someone knows the blowfish key that Skidrow used to decrypt data. That's all. I tried to get it on my own, but can't get over that stupid DRM in exe. And as I said, all I want to do is to know structure of files and extract data to compare it with Skidrow version. Steam version is not working for me. And I don't want to play cracked version (I bought game on steam sale), because it is not compatible with steam and achievements

i replaced phelp's first suit with the lapd uniform he wore in the patrol desk. i also tried doing the same with his partners.

none of them worked. either i got the file directory wrong or the game just doesn't notice the changes and a packer is needed.

Would it be possible to remove the correct / incorrect answer chimes when interviewing and interrogating in the PC version? I'd rather just let things play out naturally without the game telling me immediately that I fucked up.

I just want to say you are really great u doing it for ppl because it really worth to transalte this game into all langs and special for me and millions of other yr implementation for X360.

maybe xbox is not allowing zlib or whatever,
i could already repack these files, but i never wrote any repacker and first i want real filenames ^^

with real filenames you don't need to repack anything, the games loads them from "installdir/..." where lanoire.exe is
example filename:
intermediate/chunks/animation/conversations/ua008/ua008_00_01_dispatch_any_available_unit_citizen_reports_a_459.chunk

i found also some other stuff in lanoire.exe, -dx11 starts the game in dx11 mode, but crashs ^^
and i think it has an hidden editor,

editorui/interesting_location.dae
editorui/traffic_light_indicator.dae
models/designers_tools/invisible_prop_indicator.dae
editorui/portalroom.dae
editorui/spawnedglobalactor.dae
editorui/game_location.dae

PS: i updated my previous post with Beta2&Beta 3 of the unpacker, with support for PS3 and files bigger than 4 GB

i tried that, doesn't seem to work unless it requires specific chunk files. so we keep the file structure intact as you wrote starting with parent folder "intermediate"?

edit: searched your post and it says you need real filename. so "chunk" is not real filename? needs original name or perhaps "phelps.chunk" = "phelps_body_model.dae"?

anyway to decipher the names? thanks.

i tried changing the "chunk" extension to "dae", but i think what falo actually means is trying to find the format so he can extract it as such. meaning the chunk file itself needs to be decompiled or decrypted.

Could be. The game's great by itself but I'd like to see something new or fresh to it.

well there's no repacking yet so it's pointless anyway.

developers need to stop packing their game so tightly. it makes me very wary about the next game to come out. it might be impossible to develop proper tools.

I can write repacker, but it will only be able to repack files in big.pc and text in atb files. Theres a lot of more files, I think most textures are stored in havok files. Theres also a lot of dgad and ptm files.

Does anyone know how to contact with Falo? He knows how to force game to use extracted files, I sent him a pm, but he was last seen here on 10 June...

Oh god...the wupload link is dead, due the the whole Megaupload scare, they've gone upload only, so you can't download the tools.
BTW-anyone interested in editing models, please try to fix the models of both the Packard Clippers. The rims have screwed up transparent chrome, I think it's a bug with the matlist.

Either the matlist or the shaders. And yeah, Bondi/R* really did screw up on that one.

```

http://www.wupload.com/file/2605715047/LANOIRE-TOOLS.zip

It's based on scripts and templates for program 010 editor. For pack and unpack I used extarnal called compression algorithms from bms from aluigi (thanks). In folder "pc-text+font packer" is folder LANOIRE (path is defined in scripts - C:\LANOIRE) which is used for packing back text and fonts (for pc version with patch) (you need to insert there dlc big archives (all 9), out.wad.pc and cases.big.pc). To pack, the text must be edited in folders root and cases and dlc folders (dlc5,dlc6,dlc8) (.txt files, utf format) (fonts in out/fonts) and structure of it must be the same as it is unpacked by me (number of lines and also the new line character 0D0Ah must not be changed!). For pack you need to use scripts in the correct order (for root (gui) - 1 then 2) for cases (1-you can choose the cases texts you want to pack,2,3 (this will edit text in dlc archives - there are duplicit texts from cases and only dlc texts))

In folder "some tools" you will find some tools for unpacking the archives and templates for example to edit fonts. (unpackers are capable of extracting only some of the archives!) I will not include a guide for this one, sorry, it's up to you to understand it.

The tools are forbidden to use in another czech translation of this game!

Here are the scripts to the LA Noire GOTY PS3 version. If you edit the filenames in the scripts, you can use these to the basic LA Noire too.

PS: .ps3tex files are basically .gtf files, so you can convert them with gtf2dds and dds2gtf tools!

Like I wrote before: "Here are the scripts to the LA Noire GOTY PS3 version. If you edit the filenames in the scripts, you can use these to the basic LA Noire too."
GOTY = Complete Edition

I'm almost sure, you want to repack cases.big.ps3 file, which doesn't exist in CE edition, where used the cases.goty.big.ps3 file.
And because you didn't edited the script for the basic game, it can't find the big file.

Basic level: open "cases-big-importer_ps3.1sc", find "cases.goty.big.ps3", rename to "cases.big.ps3"

It is repack. The script read the cases files from the "cases" folder!

I'm just as interested in editing the models too. Characters could be a PITA to edit given the facial mocap technology used, but I'd like to do some corrections especially with some vehicles.

Somewhat of an odd search of mine, I've been looking for the individual footstep sounds used by the game - I've extracted about each .fsb I can find within the .big.pc files but can only find the backing sounds that play during cutscenes that contain a few footsteps - oddly enough, I cannot even find individual weapon sounds (firing, reloading, etc.)

Does anyone know where these are located it? It would be of great assistance.

i've looked over and over the key is definitely in getting real file names. they've trying to do this for the dunia/disrupt engine for watchdogs.

sadly, 2 russian modders working on that for la noire are mia for months now. i fear the worst. they could be sick or conscripted

Exactly. So far the most that I did for the game was to change the Xbox button prompts to their PSx equivalents. The game does have some modding potential imo, and it is in need of some TLC like with certain vehicle models being either off or with errors.

And to expand that "taxidermy collection" (read: archive of character/vehicle models) of yours, perhaps?

And to expand that "taxidermy collection" (read: archive of character/vehicle models) of yours, perhaps?

Heh, mostly the same in my case. It's either that I have a bunch of character models strewn all over my HDD ready to use or stare at for like five minutes, convert it to some other game, or better yet, shove whatever model I have into a game to which I would like to mess with, in this case L.A. Noire.

Most especially if they cobbled up a well-crafted model without being ridiculously high-poly.

people working on the filenames are saying game reads any file with same name placed in folder as newer version of that file. 

i need to know the file responsible for character object blocks. torso, leg, hat, etc. i want to redirect those to different objects.

So let me get this straight: Did you mean that as long as the file's hash remains the same, even if the filename isn't known, it would still work?

Someone actually did some reverse-engineering work on the .chunk files if I'm not mistaken, where he posted a pic of a flamethrower ripped from the game.

Oh and huge props to Blackbird88 for continuing on my Dualshock buttons mod too. I never knew that Bondi left over a feature where loose assets can be loaded for as long as they're in the proper folders:

Well i needed some audio files from L.A. Noire and i found it quite difficult to search for one specific track in like a few thousand audio files.

Soooo i made a little tool to make the process of converting all FSB and renaming the files (remove leading/trailing "1_", "_1" or ".wav.mp3" and such) just 2 mouse clicks. It's basically just a small frontend for the fsb converter tool.

 




Hopefully this is useful to someone.

Switch version doesn't have any compression and script doesn't work and doesn't show any errors. Just after couple of minutes working it shows "executed succesfully", even when there are no files.

this is relevant part from [aluigi's BMS script](http://aluigi.org/bms/la_noire.bms) with just big-endian removed to make it work with your Switch sample.  

```

goto -4
savepos OFFSET
get SIZE long
math OFFSET - SIZE
goto OFFSET
get ZERO long
get DUMMY long  # 3
get FILES long
for i = 0 < FILES
    get NAME_CRC long
    get OFFSET long
    get SIZE long
    get ZERO long
    get XSIZE long
    if XSIZE != 0
        math SIZE = XSIZE
    endif
    math OFFSET * 0x10
    log "" OFFSET SIZE
next i

Does anyone know whether PS3/X360 have better music quality (~80kbps mp3) than PC version?

Does the music game archive file was noticeably bigger than in PC version?

Maybe someone already ripped VR version, or PS4/X1, or maybe know whether music is in better quality in these versions?

Hi everyone!
I am currently trying to extract text files from the game in Czech language, but I cannot figure it out.
I open unpackerbig-cases.1sc in 010 Editor and then run this script on file cases.big.pc. It produces only .dat files that, when converted to .txt, are unreadable.
I am new to this, could anybody please tell me what am I doing wrong?
Thanks so much.

- Post Title: Re: L.A. Noire

So after almost 2 years and learning a bit programming I came back to LA Noire and made my own scripts + modified existing to make them work for Switch version.

Few words:
- Python scripts are designed around Python 2, didn't test for Python 3. You need "numpy" for Python installed
- It is advised to not use cmd on Windows for python scripts. Use bash from WSL to unpack/pack correctly all big.nx files + unlock long paths in regedit/gpedit
- Textures are swizzled, format used for specified texture matches format used on PC, so you can copy DDS header from PC and replace them in .nxtex (0x78 bytes belong to header) or add them to .raw file at the beginning. Fonts are using BGRA8 format, rest textures either DXT5 (most cases) or DXT1
- Console versions of game are not using strings of root.atb to render text in main menu for "NEW", "RESUME", "EXTRAS", "CASES", "VEHICLE SHOWROOM" and "CREDITS". They are baked to props files you can find in props.big.nx/intermediate/chunks/props/game_menu/*language*/

bignx.unpack.py and bignx.pack.py were tested with:
- cases.big.nx + cases.big.nx.offsets.txt
- dlc.dlc1.big.nx + dlc.dlc1.big.nx.offsets.txt
- dlc.dlc2.big.nx + dlc.dlc2.big.nx.offsets.txt
- dlc.dlc3.big.nx + dlc.dlc3.big.nx.offsets.txt
- dlc.dlc4.big.nx + dlc.dlc4.big.nx.offsets.txt
- dlc.dlc5.big.nx + dlc.dlc5.big.nx.offsets.txt
- dlc.dlc6.big.nx + dlc.dlc6.big.nx.offsets.txt
- dlc.dlc7.big.nx + dlc.dlc7.big.nx.offsets.txt
- dlc.dlc8.big.nx + dlc.dlc8.big.nx.offsets.txt
- dlc.dlc9.big.nx + dlc.dlc9.big.nx.offsets.txt
- ui_streamed_textures.big.nx + ui_streamed_textures.big.nx.offsets.txt
- props.big.nx + props.big.nx.offsets.txt

Put those files and scripts in one folder. 
Edit mainfile string in python scripts to any ".big.nx" file. ".big.nx.offsets.txt" files are used to get filenames and paths for packing and unpacking files.
bignx.pack.py is packing ".big.nx" file to "output" folder. It takes file table from original ".big.nx" file, puts it to new file and patches it with correct sizes + offsets.
If in file table in ".big.nx" archive file has two sizes described, first data is pasted with original filename, second data is pasted with original filename + ".raw".

Because different big.nx files are using different page aligning, packing original files may result in different size. This is normal as I'm using page aligning "size & 0xF" because this is used by game for all big.nx files.

For extracting and patching wad + atb files I have modified 010 scripts from kramla's LANOIRE-TOOLS
USAGE
- cases-atb-unpack.1sc (it works with DLC files too):
Load this script to 010 editor
Press F7
Select .chunk.nx files in attribute folder for any unpacked .big.nx archive
.chunk.nx.txt file will be generated in the same folder as .chunk.nx

If you want to extract different language change 0 from at lines 83 and 92 "k==0" to
0 - English
1 - French
2 - German
3 - Italian
4 - Japanese
5 - Russian
6 - Spanish

- cases-atb-pack.1sc (it works with DLC files too):
Load this script to 010 editor
Press F7
Select chunx.nx.txt files in attribute folder for any unpacked .big.nx archive
.chunk.nx file in the same folder will be patched with data from .chunk.nx.txt

If you want to replace different language change 0 from at lines 83 and 103 "k==0" to
0 - English
1 - French
2 - German
3 - Italian
4 - Japanese
5 - Russian
6 - Spanish

If 010 editor exits at some other language than English when importing data from txt files, try to open this txt file with Notepad++, convert EOL from Windows to Linux and go back to Windows from Linux, then save. If still exits, try to delete last 2 empty lines in Notepad++ and put one empty line by pressing enter at the end of file, then save.

- out-wad-unpack.1sc:
Load out.wad.nx to 010 Editor
Load out-wad-unpack.1sc to 010 editor
Focus 010 Editor on out.wad.nx and press F7
If list of scripts will be showed to choose, choose and run out-wad-unpack.1sc
Files will be extracted to C:/LANOIRE/out

- out-wad-importer.1sc
Put original out.wad.nx to C:/LANOIRE
Load out-wad-unpack.1sc to 010 editor
Press F7
Files from C:/LANOIRE/out will be imported to out.wad.nx in C:/LANOIRE

- root-atb-unpack.1sc:

Load this script to 010 editor
Press F7
Select root.atb.nx file that is in C:/LANOIRE/out/attribute
root.atb.nx.txt file will be generated in the same folder as root.atb.nx

If you want to extract different language change 0 from at lines 83 and 92 "k==0" to
0 - English
1 - French
2 - German
3 - Italian
4 - Japanese
5 - Russian
6 - Spanish

- root-atb-pack.1sc (if this script doesn't work, use cases-atb-pack):
Load this script to 010 editor
Press F7
Select root.atb.nx.txt file that is in C:/LANOIRE/out/attribute
root.atb.nx file that is in the same folder will be patched with data from root.atb.nx.txt

If you want to replace different language change 0 from at lines 83 and 103 "k==0" to
0 - English
1 - French
2 - German
3 - Italian
4 - Japanese
5 - Russian
6 - Spanish

BTW. thanks for 0 help from kramla because spending 15 minutes on explaining scripts seems too difficult for him.   

EDIT: Uploaded scripts again, by accident i put wrong version of cases-atb-unpack

Does anyone know whether PS3/X360 have better music quality (~80kbps mp3) than PC version?

Does the music game archive file was noticeably bigger than in PC version?

Maybe someone already ripped VR version, or PS4/X1, or maybe know whether music is in better quality in these versions?

Sorry for the late reply. I can definitely say that the PC version of the VR case files has the music stored as 320kbit/s MP3 files. I doubt all the music is there, though.
Here is a screenshot comparing the original spectrals (80kbit/s) with the improved vr version (320kbit/s):

So after almost 2 years and learning a bit programming I came back to LA Noire and made my own scripts + modified existing to make them work for Switch version.

Few words:
- Python scripts are designed around Python 2, didn't test for Python 3. You need "numpy" for Python installed
- It is advised to not use cmd on Windows for python scripts. Use bash from WSL to unpack/pack correctly all big.nx files + unlock long paths in regedit/gpedit
- Textures are swizzled, format used for specified texture matches format used on PC, so you can copy DDS header from PC and replace them in .nxtex (0x78 bytes belong to header) or add them to .raw file at the beginning. Fonts are using BGRA8 format, rest textures either DXT5 (most cases) or DXT1
- Console versions of game are not using strings of root.atb to render text in main menu for "NEW", "RESUME", "EXTRAS", "CASES", "VEHICLE SHOWROOM" and "CREDITS". They are baked to props files you can find in props.big.nx/intermediate/chunks/props/game_menu/*language*/

bignx.unpack.py and bignx.pack.py were tested with:
- cases.big.nx + cases.big.nx.offsets.txt
- dlc.dlc1.big.nx + dlc.dlc1.big.nx.offsets.txt
- dlc.dlc2.big.nx + dlc.dlc2.big.nx.offsets.txt
- dlc.dlc3.big.nx + dlc.dlc3.big.nx.offsets.txt
- dlc.dlc4.big.nx + dlc.dlc4.big.nx.offsets.txt
- dlc.dlc5.big.nx + dlc.dlc5.big.nx.offsets.txt
- dlc.dlc6.big.nx + dlc.dlc6.big.nx.offsets.txt
- dlc.dlc7.big.nx + dlc.dlc7.big.nx.offsets.txt
- dlc.dlc8.big.nx + dlc.dlc8.big.nx.offsets.txt
- dlc.dlc9.big.nx + dlc.dlc9.big.nx.offsets.txt
- ui_streamed_textures.big.nx + ui_streamed_textures.big.nx.offsets.txt
- props.big.nx + props.big.nx.offsets.txt

Put those files and scripts in one folder. 
Edit mainfile string in python scripts to any ".big.nx" file. ".big.nx.offsets.txt" files are used to get filenames and paths for packing and unpacking files.
bignx.pack.py is packing ".big.nx" file to "output" folder. It takes file table from original ".big.nx" file, puts it to new file and patches it with correct sizes + offsets.
If in file table in ".big.nx" archive file has two sizes described, first data is pasted with original filename, second data is pasted with original filename + ".raw".

Because different big.nx files are using different page aligning, packing original files may result in different size. This is normal as I'm using page aligning "size & 0xF" because this is used by game for all big.nx files.

1. You're using Windows path in bash, which is wrong.
2. You're not putting script as argument for Python.

They are not the issues with scripts. You don't understand how WSL and Python scripts work.

The scripts were made using an old patch, so some things are outdated now. The contents of cases and out are different on the latest patch (like there's some dx11 files in graphicsdata that weren't there before). So contents of cases.big.pc and out.wad.pc from latest patch need to be unpacked again and replace those.

Problem is that root.atb.pc on latest patch doesn't work with the scripts.
[https://mega.nz/file/n0wmAbJS#D-_ARYUVH ... F95EaxAjcs](https://mega.nz/file/n0wmAbJS#D-_ARYUVHcg6-xl0zGCvfUYhgYPlVgR7CF95EaxAjcs)

They also won't work with root.atb.ps4.
[https://mega.nz/file/X5g2BJwD#N2s76hixF ... bIShIwkdt4](https://mega.nz/file/X5g2BJwD#N2s76hixF3oDfDwq4W6sH07rzbdRJ_5kRbIShIwkdt4)

It does still seem to work though with cases.big.ps4.

I can definitely say that the PC version of the VR case files has the music stored as 320kbit/s MP3 files. I doubt all the music is there, though.
Thank you very much for your reply!
But does it sound better for sure? Wasn't it simply recompressed from regular PC 80kbit/s version into 320kbit/s?
I don't know If I remember correctly, but in regular PC version there were also some music files in mono. Do they occur here as well?

It wasn't transcoded from the 80kbit/s version (see my spectral comparison from March 22) and yes, it sounds better. Only a handful of tracks, though (about 57). The rest is either missing in the VR version or is identical to the PC/PS/XBOX version in terms of bitrate and channels.

I would like to make a HD texture pack for L.A. Noire,  but I'm stuck on if there even is a way to extract/repack the textures.
Does anyone know?
