- Post Title: Echo of Soul [March 2013 CBT]

Ello' there. I'm wondering if anyone has a copy of the Echo of Soul client from back in March of 2013 that they could provide a download for? This version of EoS was scrapped by Hangame and now is being done by Aeria Games. The Aeria Games version of EoS isn't compatible with any known method of extracting models, however, the CBT from March 2013 can be.
