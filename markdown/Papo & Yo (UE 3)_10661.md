- Post Title: Papo & Yo (UE 3)

Hello.

The game Papo & Yo runs on the Unreal Engine 3.
I can't open the files with the UE Viewer aka umodel.

The file extension is .wem
I try to rename one in .upk and opened it with umodel, but umodel won't open it.

Can someone help?
I've uploaded a file as a attachment.

.wem file contains sound  
And Gildor's tools have no support for Papo & Yo, yet.

EDIT: They have support for that game.

.wem audio?
I dont think so there are a few .ogg files in the directory as well 

170 MB .wem files and 25 MB .ogg files.
There are also .bnk files (133 MB).

I know that its not supported.
gildor has written .wem is an unknow format and he can't support it then.

Thanks to someone of the gildor forums.
The character and animal meshes are in the file "PYGame.u".
You can open it with the UE viewer.

The rest of the models are in the map files.
