- Post Title: RuneScape decompression code

By decompiling and deobfuscting Java code from RuneScape, I got this code: [http://pastie.caboo.se/181708](http://pastie.caboo.se/181708)

Right now it's possible to decompress the archives from the cache. The problem is we can't figure out the algorithm, to be able to compress it afterwards.

Hope someone can help, thanks.

Well normally noone invents a completely new compression algorithm.
Maybe it's similar to any algo out there you can use as a base.

I have no experience in compression algorithms, was hoping some of you could notice any similarities with existing compression algorithms.

Maybe you could go through the code and summarize a little bit what it does. Perhaps you can also find out how the compressed data is saved/encoded.
I don't have the time to look through all that code.

Lol, that's what i was thinking when I hit line 56
I found it a bit messy, I never understood why professional programmers use 'i' in a forloop.

It has to do with something like FORTRAN or COBOL; don't remember the exact context, but it's been around for a long time, its kind of a precedent thing.
