- Post Title: Dragon Ball Z: Budokai Tenkaichi 3 Textures

Hello!!!
I am wondering if anyone can help me extract texture files from budokai tenkaichi 3 archives.
There are quite a few tools and scripts for models with uvs already, I just need the textures. I have a tool by KKTeamTenkaichi that lets you browse the ".unk" archives. I've gotten the textures of a character already, yet, it is in the ".unk" format. There are multiple textures in this one file. I was wondering if someone could unpack the textures from the file.

Much appreciated!!!

Use NinjaRipper and make sure the wrapper is D3D11.

Press F10 while in-game to rip textures.

.dds is the texture name.
