- Post Title: The Muppets Inside CD-Rom various filetypes

Hey - recently my friend got his hands on the game The Muppets Inside, a game released about 1996. It has these really weird file compression methods, and both he and I have no idea how to open them or what they're for. His project is taking all the sprites from it and submitting them to the Spriters Resource, and he's trying to find all the sprites he can. I'm helping him. Now, I'm not sure if these are compressed files or archives or what, but we can't open them in any way, so I decided I'd post here.

The two filetypes are .cd and .scf, and I've zipped up one of each. If you manage to open/decompress one, could you let me know how you did so, so we can open the rest?

the CD archive doesn't seem to contain a file table.
SCF is unclear anyway it does not contain the file table of the CD file.
