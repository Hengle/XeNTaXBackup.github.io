- Post Title: Parappa The Rapper 2 Bad/Awful Instrumentals

So, I'm from the Parappa modding community, and I'm trying to figure out how to edit the bad/awful instrumentals for the stages, but when I play it in MFaudio like a normal good or cool instrumental, it sounds really bad. But actually, good and cool both have 2 channels, so what I'm thinking is that the interleave could also be 400 (the normal 2x) and have 2 channels, because bad/awful are in the same file, and 2 channels for each. However, I run into a problem. MFaudio will not let me play or export songs into 4 channels. So the only way I know how to play those files is using Winamp with the Vgmstream plugin, which I highly doubt that method would let me edit the files and put them back in the game. So does anybody know how to export audio in MFaudio as 4 channels? Or just get a way to edit the bad/awful tracks in general?

Nevermind, solved the problem by tricking MFaudio to use a stereo .wp2 as a mono, like the ones in the bad/awful glitched tracks.

wow, thanks, your tricking method actually worked, but actually the interleave value is still 200, not 400, just typing this for random wonderers

How do you trick it into using a stereo .wp2 as a mono one?

For those that are having trouble with Bad/Awful instrumentals, Please find attached a program I made that can convert them to .wav and back. It also works with Good and Cool instrumentals. I'm still working on it and plan to add support for more PaRappa 2 audio formats in the future, so if you find bugs please let me know. (Note: The tool is windows only but should run fine through WINE)
