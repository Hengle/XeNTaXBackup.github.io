1) On Xbox 360 and PS3 blood look like better than PC version (but PC cutscenes have this splashing blood with body damage), how to unlock it to gameplay ? 2) 7 Gen consoles have better textures, models, effects, shaders, weather better than PC - how to extract and convert it ?

i think you can't export model from ps3 version to pc version because i'ts not the same engine. The ps3 and xbox version are built with the same model has the godfather 2
