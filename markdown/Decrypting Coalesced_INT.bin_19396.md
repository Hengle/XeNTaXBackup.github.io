- Post Title: Decrypting Coalesced_INT.bin

Hello,

So I've been trying to decrypt Coalesced_INT.bin from some Unreal Engine 3 game released in 2013. I've opened the .exe file in HxD and only referrence to Coalesced was this part of:

```
.....C.o.o.k.e.d.....%.s.=.%.s...1...Y.e.s...T.r.u.e.....O.n.....%.i.....F.a.l.s.e..xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx.....E.N.G.L.I.S.H.C.O.A.L.E.S.C.E.D.....%.s.C.o.a.l.e.s.c.e.d._.%.s...b.i.n....Coalesced.ini......b.i.n.....C.o.a.l.e.s.c.e.d._....‚AÏ.‚AÏ ‚AÏ°‚™üp‚B¶p‚B£¸‚B¡`‚BŒ.‚B.(.-.g.A.B.C.=........?Ä_0mÉÈƒG€......¿Ä_0mÉÈƒ‚Gûx‚F¦.‚™üp‚™üpƒ.. ƒ.. ƒ.. ;€€.=¢ùƒ....?.6âë.C-Äl@.....@.......Dl@.A...ÂR..@€..¿ð..A¨..A`..B|..BŒ..BÒ..ÂÒ..Àð..À ..@à..>...Að..?ø......Áp..¿À..À@..?tvE¿....U.S.P.S.t.a.t.e.O.b.j.e.c.t.......%.s.......S.c.r.i.p.t. .c.a.l.l. .
```


How do I determine what part of this is key to decrypt the file (if it even is the key) and what kind of encryption was used on the .BIN file?

Lost Planet 3 for Xbox 360

Uncrypted, uncompressed .xex file - [https://anonfile.com/G6F5M7r4b2/default_uncrypted_xex](https://anonfile.com/G6F5M7r4b2/default_uncrypted_xex)
Coalesced_INT.bin - [https://anonfile.com/HfFcM7rebb/Coalesced_INT_bin](https://anonfile.com/HfFcM7rebb/Coalesced_INT_bin)

I would like to know the process that goes through decrypting these files, not just getting the ready key or tool.
