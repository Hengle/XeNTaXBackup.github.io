- Post Title: Models from FusionFall

I am trying to extract 3d models, animations, textures etc from these really unique Unity Custom Asset Bundles, made in the rather exotic custom editor of Unity called 2.5.5b4, and I have had no luck on getting anything from them (except music and a bunch of corrupted/missing header files.. I'll include a sample to download. Also I believe the headers are broken/corrupt, as a lot of the models are supposed to be .nif and I am unable to open them in NifSkope, same with the pictures

Here is a sample of the files - [https://www.mediafire.com/?cct8539ch9gcell](https://www.mediafire.com/?cct8539ch9gcell)
