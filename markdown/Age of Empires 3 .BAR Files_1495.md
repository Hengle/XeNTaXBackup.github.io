Plugin to extract from Age of Empires III demo version *.BAR files. 

Unzip in the data/plugins folder of MultiEx Commander. 

Then you can open the Age Of Empires 3 BAR files. 

Replacement code is being worked on, so you can really add your exact national language to the game. Be patient.

No, I cannot open these BAR files as Age of Mythology BAR files. That's why I wrote a new plugin.
