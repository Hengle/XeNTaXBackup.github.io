- Post Title: Star wars the old republic - Gizka model

Hey! I recently got access to swtor models however i encountered a problem. Noesis does not seem to want to export the pet_tauntaun_gizka file from swtor_main_art_zed_1.tor or any of its textures or animations. I do not know why exactly this is the case, however could some one see if they can export it and send it my way?

Eh, I didn't read properly. I thought you were using EasyMYP.

So here's the files.
I even added the skeleton, should you want that.
