I'm a starter in extracting game sounds, so I don't know much. The most I've done is extract MIDIs and Soundtracks from DS games, however I am making a fan-game that requires me to extract the voices from Ultimate Ninja Storm 2 for PS3/Xbox360 so I can do voices.

The main issue is the fact that I have extracted NUB files and I cannot find anything to convert them to WAV or any other sound format.

I have tried googling it, youtube searching, asking friends, searching on other search engines, and on forums (even these forums) and found nothing that seems to work.

I have previously tried the Ultimate Ninja Storm 2 XMA converter (however I didn't get XMA files), VGMStream, and some other programs.

If you guys could tell me how to convert those NUB voice files to WAV, I would really appreciate it!
