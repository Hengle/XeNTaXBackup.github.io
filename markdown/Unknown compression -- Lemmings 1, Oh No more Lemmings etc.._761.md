- Post Title: Unknown compression -- Lemmings 1, Oh No more Lemmings etc..

Hi
I am interested to play the original tunes from "oh no more lemmings" &
"X-Mas Lemmings / Holiday Lemmings" (and more too).
The onliest available tool which can play Lemmings-tunes is "rdosplay".
(Greeeat tool to play maaany different adlib-tunes.)
And here are the tunes:
[http://sorry.vse.cz/~roman/dimension/rd ... us-lem.zip](http://sorry.vse.cz/~roman/dimension/rdos/rdosplay/mus-lem.zip)

I cannot reach the author of "rdosplay" so I only can ask here.

How can I extract/get the original tunes from the different lemmings games in the (same) original format?
The mentioned zip-file only contains the tunes of "X-Mas Lemmings / Holiday
Lemmings" but I would like to add more tunes with the same "lem"-format.

Well I allready tried to dump the memory of
"dosbox-emulator"([http://dosbox.sf.net](http://dosbox.sf.net)) while lemmings was loaded, but I
could not find anything (while using a hex-editor) which looks like the
"*.lem-tunes".

Furthermore I am interested in the adlib file format in different
lemmings-games.
In the early different Lemmings-games it seems to be that different
compression/encryption-methods for the game-files were used.
(some executables of the different lemmings use pklite, but what is about
the other files like adlib.dat?)
I am interested in more details too.

Could you help, please?

as those games are in the nostalgia era,they are for sure ripped since a while.

deliplayer is a win player who play almost every custom formats tough.

I have created a script to extract from archives that are like Lemmings 2 : VOC-format. Will be updated online soon. just check if there's a new update (from within MultiEx Commander).

Oh and get the quick-fix, this will remove a bug in the downloadable version, and re-enable downloads of new formats from within MultiEx Commander. Find it in the News or Troubleshooting forum. 

Lemmings 3 has its tunes saved separately (HMI files, play with WinAmp!).
