- Post Title: Earth 2150 .TEX format?

Hi there here is ny first post,
Does anybody know the format of the Earth series (Earth 2150,The Moon Project & Lost Souls) .tex files? 
I know they are a strange tiled version of a TGA file with some kind of pallette. 
What is really clever with them is the faxct they can be perfectly scaled with different screen sizes right up to 1200x1200 pixels.

I have managed to extractsome of the TGA files from the .wd and .tex files using 
Total Commander and 
GAUP (which is available from here...

Any body have any ideas as to reconstructing them?
