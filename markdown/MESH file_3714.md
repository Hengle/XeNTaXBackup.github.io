you need to be patient there is no documentation on this format and it must be reversed and coded to get any kind of viewer.
you also posted in the wrong section.
you need to put some effort into your posts of you want help use complete words and sentences.

i found this.

[http://www.8monkeylabs.com/technology](http://www.8monkeylabs.com/technology)

the dudes who made the game released somekind of viewer for the models. you can open anything in from the game in it. but it dosnt have an export option 

the god news is i tryed a F.E.A.R 2 mesh in it & it worked, so this shows promise on 2 fronts  "woooooo"

in the download theres an exporter for maya that will export your own models into the MESH format that the game uses!.
---

now my question is:....

can anyone do anythng with this that import the models into 3dmax "or maya".

thanx
