- Post Title: Vertex attributes - Are this bones or something else?

Hello everyone,

I've been working on a Noesis script to import some models. It's working pretty well, however there are some data at the vertex that I'm not using, because I don't know what they are. I think they are about bones. I tried to read them as bones but it didn't manage to get it working, so before spending more time trying to read them as bones I think it's better to know exactly what they are.

Below is a print of some vertices. I think that the unknown1 are 3 bones index and the unknown2 is a bone weight.


I have attached a sample file.

Thanks in advance!

I figured out what are the unknown1 and unknown2, now the damage are working well.
