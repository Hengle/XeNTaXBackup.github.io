- Post Title: Cig format: Wizardry tale of the forsaken land PS2

Hello. I'm mostly a lurker, and not much one of reserve engineering or file formats however I exhausted nearly all possible avenues as to how extract this archive short of either brute forcing it or learning the method myself 

As stated in the title, the format in question is from a early Atlus PS2 game, Wizardry tale of the forsaken land PS2

This is the file: [https://mega.nz/file/jlI1mbpB#E91PQOlNp ... ABf3j7l-k0](https://mega.nz/file/jlI1mbpB#E91PQOlNpkq7URhn-qN02vqA3TMkf5I3bABf3j7l-k0)

As far as I know, the only other Atlus published game that uses this particular format, is Growlanser generations  

I looked all over for information of this format, but in Wizardy's case, the only thing that can extract it is this old bms script from ps23dformat: [https://web.archive.org/web/20180724222 ... ken%20Land](https://web.archive.org/web/20180724222335/https://ps23dformat.wikispaces.com/Wizardry%20Tale%20of%20the%20Forsaken%20Land)

However this script only extracts the 3D models, I'm looking to get the actual in game 2D artwork which is TMX format like many Atlus games, or at least a full extraction BMS script

All the other information I could find related to this format is Growlanser related (Which I would also like to get into but that's for another time.)

Thanks to whoever may read this and takes some interest
