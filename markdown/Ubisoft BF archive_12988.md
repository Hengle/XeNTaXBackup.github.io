- Post Title: Ubisoft BF archive

I've been trying to extract this bf file with the script for The adventures of tin tin. But whenever it gets to a certain file, I receive this error "the compressed LZO input is wrong or incomplete (-6)"
Another error comes up below it "the uncompressed data (-1) is bigger than the allocated buffer (89711)"

Archive example: [https://www.mediafire.com/?dn6rlgn7ylnnwkc](https://www.mediafire.com/?dn6rlgn7ylnnwkc)

Does anyone know how to fix this?
