- Post Title: 300 Heroes \ 300英雄 Data exctract

After several updates, it seems to me that the character models from the game have been recoded or something like that, since I personally tried one script in two updates: 
In the first case, the update later than the present time did not extract all the models
In the second case (now) there is a refusal to extract the game files at all

Maybe i wrong somewhere , I will be glad to help.
