- Post Title: Tom Clancy's games music ripped

i finally found how to rip the music in tom clancy's games after 129 hours of searching    
first for ghost recon advanced warfighter2 G.R.A.W. 2 Use BUNDLE Extractor. Then use Novaextractor to extract the wavs from the BANK files
 and put them together.
for splinter cell double agent and rainbow six vegas (r6 vegas) use goldwave to play the SS0 and SB0 files u may also need dragon unpacker as some SS0 AND SB0 files may have 2 sound files rather than one

-for goldwave:

-for bundle extractor:
