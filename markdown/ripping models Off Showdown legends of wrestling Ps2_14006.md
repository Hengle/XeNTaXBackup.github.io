- Post Title: ripping models Off Showdown legends of wrestling Ps2

I've been trying to rip models off Showdown Legends of Wrestling for PS2 using PCSX2 Emulator,tried it several times but to no avail.
Is it possible to rip the models from the games files?
I see someone has ripped the textures but not the models.

The archive is in .dr format and two files according to me might contain the model files
wrestler.dr
costumes.dr
