- Post Title: Hitman Sniper Challenge (.pc_resourcelib) files

Welcome.
In this thread i want to ask if anyone has an idea of how to open and extract models and textures of these .pc_resourcelib files, hopefully someone is already working on it since this would be the perfect time to do it, since the actual game Hitman: Absolution will use the same file format.
