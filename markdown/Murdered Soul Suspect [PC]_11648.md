- Post Title: Murdered: Soul Suspect [PC]

This game technically run only on 64bit with a modified unreal engine, I think it was UE3.
The issue is that you cannot change the key binding on it.
I made change in My Games\Murdered Soul Suspect\FateGame\Config with FateInput.ini
I made change in Murdered - Soul Suspect\FateGame\Config Samr with FateInput.ini and DefaultInput.ini

Tried a save and a new game, no luck, yet the change on all 3 ini are not reseted to default. It seem that the game does not even read them at all.

So my question for those who know the engine, is it possible that the input.ini is compiled within the .exe or inside a .upk ?

I have already used the extractor.exe and the umodel, could not fnd anything.
Nor I could bring the dev console or anything alike.

I think you should try setting the ini files as read only mode, and also ini files in Document folder.

When i start the game, then close it, the .ini files are left untouched.
Whatever change I made on it did not take effect. So it make me wonder if the .ini are really used or not on this context.
