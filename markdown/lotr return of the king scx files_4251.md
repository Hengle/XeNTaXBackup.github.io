- Post Title: lotr return of the king scx files?

Hi,
Has anyone had any luck extracting sounds from the scx archives found in lrod of the rings return of the king?
I have been trying with game extractor and kesbox but their scanners find nothing.
If anyone knows anything please tell me, as this game has the best medieval sfx ever.
Thanks.
