- Post Title: PvZ Heroes (Unity) - Replace fonts

So i just want to replace the font in a game named "PvZ Heroes" which is a Unity game on Play Store/ App Store. To add a font that supported my language, but i'm kinda stuck with it. Would appreciated if someone can help me finding the method for this (maybe i will donate lol).

The font file is located in this path on Android: Android/data/com.ea.gp.pvzheroes/files/cache/bundles/files/autotagged/a0620d8a921064dee86c36e95ccf5151_63

yes I know how to add the characters you need without changing the ones that already exist, 
but I have only done it on the pc platform.
Never on other platforms.

I need all the game files.
Only this file I can't do anything with.
They have to be striated like on the pc.
Send your discord that then we talk better.
But as I said I know how to do the pc platform.
I have never done in others.

The character problem has been solved.
I added new ones, not replaced any.
It has all the original characters plus the new ones.
The font is SDF.
And I don't know how to create an SDF font.
heehehheheheheh.

Hi.
As I already told you in unity no one ever helps me with anything. I had to study and pay for those studies for 1 year. 
Always ask for help and nobody helped me, recently I asked for help to create the characters of the game i am setsuna nobody even answered, then I studied more and solve my problem.
Understand that not even a clock works for free, why should I do it for free?
