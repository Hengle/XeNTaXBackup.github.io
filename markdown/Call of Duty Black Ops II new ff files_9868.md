- Post Title: Call of Duty Black Ops II new ff files

CODBO2 has just released yesterday and it uses all new file format. Sound formats seems still be wave sound but stored inside sabl/sabs container, not iwd/zip anymore. And also fast file *.ff is difference from old versions, not zlib compressed anymore. I have tried old ff file extractor/decompressor but they all didn't work. Can anyone help me to extract/decompress the new *.ff files. This is sample files, both sound and ff archives.

As far as I know with small knowledge , *.sabs files contains "flac" audio file format 

each file is a container of many files , extracting them is very simple I may write a small tool to extract them

about *.sabl still don't know what they are 

*.ff I guess they are using some kind of encryption , beside zilb , I'm not sure I probably be wrong 

so we need someone to debug the .exe to find out the structure of the file , and it's not me 

*.ipak just another container of "Iwi" texture but modified than the latest versions that used in COD

that's all I know hope it helps

Cheers

About the .sabs files, I just did a simple rename. Mind you, that was on an individual file . Will check out a multiple file archive soon!
