UPDATE : It seems I will have to fill this forum myself. Note that far more requests are complete, but not yet transferred to this one.

seems that this section is wrongly used by all the newbies who are looking for models and other similar stuff.
I guess you would prefer to restrict it only to moderators to avoid that all these *nice people* use it as a trashcan.

Yeah, or perhaps I should just dump it back into the Game Archives section if possible.

Should be possible; phpBB should give you the option to move all affected topics to a forum of your choosing when you delete a forum (though you may want to test first to be sure).

This may be a good time to think about/discuss possible guidelines in regards to how threads should be named, and decide whether we'd want to adopt a "one thread per game/format" policy or the like.
