Here is a chinese mmo with nif files in it. Archive seems encrypted. Here is 14 mb from beginning and and end of a 700mb archive containing models and textures:

it's a normal zip file encrypted with zipcrypto and the password should be something like "Mw2zd198703k" followed by a number ("%s%d").
maybe I could have some updates later but I don't know.

if you want to help me in the meantime open MwEngine_Shipping_dll.dll with a hex editor and place the byte 0xcc at offset 0x17706 (obviously avoid to auto-update the game if it requests).
if the program crashes and you can attach ollydbg then the password should be visible in the stack window and you can paste it in this thread

Reviving 



Found this in a hidden dll file

[http://www.2shared.com/file/rjVfwgyL/Mw ... g_dll.html](http://www.2shared.com/file/rjVfwgyL/MwEngine_Shipping_dll.html)

Might the key be there?
