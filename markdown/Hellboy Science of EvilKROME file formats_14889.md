- Post Title: Hellboy: Science of Evil/KROME file formats

Hey folks, I'm wondering if someone here might be able to take a look at these for me. I know there's been a few people take a stab at the older Hellboy ps1 games for whatever reason, but nobody really took a look at the more recent stuff. Thanks to Luigi's RKV script, I managed to extract the texture files (which I'm not sure what to convert with), along with a bunch of other files I'm assuming relate to the models themselves. Here are a few samples; if anyone's up for taking a look, I'd appreciate the help! 

[Here's a link to one of the .RKV files](https://mega.nz/#!rZYiHazI!7L5bAKW8cVn5AZeMQS8m46-dk1ZCAR04ghZNpbcZslI) and if anyone wants to take a look at it using this script that Luigi put together you can [find it here](http://aluigi.org/bms/rkv4.bms)

[Here's a sample .mdl](https://mega.nz/#!bQRlUZCQ!3Z1TvbxuhJUd5fWPw5nCUWDStWiQUVAyLMFiis9MBDg)

[Here's a sample .mib](https://mega.nz/#!7JYH0LRJ!A4un96vkJB-MrBj_WRVJH3AoDuwlLjq3qKo29CvkHfM)

[Here's a sample .tex](https://mega.nz/#!iNYlWBZT!I_DdVFfVKAg-9TZZ5TGfe3ftT87eCYxR-EdVdZhhO1U)

I THINK that's pretty much all that's needed, but anyone wanting to look further into them might need to check the RKV above.
