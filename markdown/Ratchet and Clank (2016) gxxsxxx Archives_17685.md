- Post Title: Ratchet and Clank (2016) gxxsxxx Archives

Hi there! I'd like some help from one of you brave souls courageous enough to take on this archive format. It's from the PS4 version of Ratchet and Clank (the one based off the movie, based off the game). There are a number of these archives and unfortunately it's not the standard PSARC I was expecting. I included one of the smaller archives as the majority are 1-3+ GB in size as well as some associated files (tables or filelists?). Please and thanks!
