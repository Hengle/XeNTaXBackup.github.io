- Post Title: 3ds max Star wars Battlefront 3 model unwrap data missing!?

CanÂ someone please help me out with this model??.
Attached are images of the A-Wing I extracted from SWBF3 via Ninja Ripper x64 (this I don't understand this as the game is x32 and  NRx32 doesn't work when try to extract, though the x64 version does!?) 

Once imported into 3ds max via NR max script, I add the 'Unwrap UVW' modifier to the model..
Problem is when you go into the UV Editor within the modifier, it fails to display the model unwrapped!?
I've done the same process with Disney Infinity 3.0, add the modifier and the model is already unwrapped but no luck with this game? 
I know.. different game/different engine etc but I'm praying that I can find a workaround to avoid redoing the unwrap & seams.

I'd greatly appreciate anyone's suggestions!!!?
