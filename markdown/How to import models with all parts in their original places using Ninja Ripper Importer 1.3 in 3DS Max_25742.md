- Post Title: How to import models with all parts in their original places using Ninja Ripper Importer 1.3 in 3DS Max?

Hello. Is there any way to import all the parts (at once and in the right places) of a model ripped with Ninja Ripper 1.3? An example: I ripped some Arma 2 models using Ninja Ripper and when I imported them into 3DS Max, all the pieces appeared in the center of the 3D scene of the program, all being out of their correct places. I noticed that the configuration window for import has some configurable parameters (as can be seen in the image of the post), but I don't know how to use these. Does anyone know how to do the correct import?

Simple answer is NO.

You must use the updated version 2 located here on the official website: [https://ninjaripper.com/](https://ninjaripper.com/)

Oh yes. I only asked this because in some games this problem did not occur. But thanks

You forget to add that you need to PAY for the program, because it is no longer a free program.

Is there any other such program that is free?

Oh, thanks friend  I've been hearing about him for a long time. I will check if it is effective and I will test it. Ripping models with a lot of parts and having to put them all in place is difficult

You can still download the 1.71 version of NinjaRipper, the last version before they turned greed. It comes with a Noesis plugin for preview & later chose which to import.

I didn't forget anything, there was no question to begin with IF free or paid tools are available for such tasks.

You need to slow your roll, this type of self entitlement is beyond unacceptable, yes, HE used to develop that software for free back in the day when it all started, it didn't get HIM very far, due to actual greed of its USERS, NOT himself, because HE was very serious in to making it work with the modern alongside older games too, technology has advanced rapidly ever since, to reverse/test the amount of games, their shaders and such, it requires monumental effort and not to mention lots of time, there was no THEY it's a one man job that HE does, and HE IS entitled to charge what ever HE thinks HE deserves for HIS hard work, ever since HE joined Patreon, HE finally made huge progress in a short time span, all HIS expenses are covered there for more time is spent towards developing a better, proper ripping tool, so you see, it is a win/win situation.

Legend:
HE/HIS/HIM = blackninja, the main dev of the tool
THEY =  non existent
USERS =  greedy people who think HIS work values zero and are self entitled to HIS hard work

cheers

Not gonna fall for it, sorry.

Yes, I have this version. I use it to rip games and, in some cases, as I said in the post, there is that problem of importing objects into 3DS Max and they are in the wrong positions. An example of this is some vehicles that, when imported, have all parts positioned at 0,0,0. But anyway, thanks for responding. I will try to resolve this.

I too have tested the older versions many times on various games, on some games you can be lucky to have certain assets positioned correctly as you see in-game including collisions too, which i find that odd, but for the most part everything else will be ripped at 0,0,0.

Have you tried the Snap tool inside 3dsMax, it can be of great help for such tasks to place parts for a vehicle as in your case, i believe only positions might work that way though, not proper rotations too, since there are no dummy bones to guide yourself with that have rotations as well as angles.

Yes, I'm using Snap from 3DS Max. Maybe it was just my laziness to think that putting it all together would be a huge job XD But, doing it now, I realized that it's even fun to assemble the entire model and get to know how 3D is actually done. In my case, I'm dealing with the parts of a tank, and the round entrance door (which is on top of the turret) has the pivot exactly on the axis of rotation of the region that fits the turret. I found this really interesting and intriguing, since, generally, all ripped models have a pivot in the center of them.
