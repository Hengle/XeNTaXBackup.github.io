- Post Title: Gran Turismo HD Concept Soundtrack extraction

I have the games PKG extracted on my PC, but I cannot for the life of me figure out how to extract the GT4.VOL file to get at the soundtrack of the game. 
Can anybody offer any help? 
I have tried gttools and no dice, even with the file named as GT3.VOL. Has anybody ever cracked this encryption? All I want is the soundtrack but cannot find it anywhere online either.
