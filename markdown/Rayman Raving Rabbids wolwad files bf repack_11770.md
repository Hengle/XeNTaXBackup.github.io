- Post Title: Rayman Raving Rabbids wol/wad files /bf repack

Hello guys, I extracted Rayman 4 bf files, so I got wol files but some of them are prototype of a cancelled game and may be loadable, but they have some bytes then zeros, So I'm wondering does anyone knows how to repack the bf files? Also it has bin files which when extracted gives bin.dec files, and those one contains textures, sounds,texts, so does anyone can extract this?
Bf unpacker: [http://www.xentax.com/downloads/tools/h ... packer.rar](http://www.xentax.com/downloads/tools/hosted/gamespecific/rayman4/rayman4_bf_unpacker.rar)
Bin extractor: [viewtopic.php?f=10&t=3400](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=3400)
Thanks!
Edit: I can also provide sample of bf file, but it's 800mb, and it's against forum rules but this could be done by PM, and if someone wants to check I can upload the 800Mb but I can give by PM wol files
, bin files and .bin.dec files
