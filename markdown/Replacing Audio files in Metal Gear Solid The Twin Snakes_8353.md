- Post Title: Replacing Audio files in Metal Gear Solid The Twin Snakes

So I've been trying to work on a little project where I swap all the audio files for the different areas in Metal Gear Solid The Twin Snakes with the original audio files from the playstation version. I've used GC-Tool-gamecube to view the content of the iso and I believe I've found the audio files that I need to replace. However when I extract these files to my desktop, I've noticed that the extensions are spt and spd. I found the plugin, vgmstream, that works with winamp but after properly installing the .dll in the plugins folder and the windows system folder the spt/spd files won't play. I get the following error message: 
Error creating DirectSound buffer. Error code:80070057.

I would like to play the songs so I know which track it is since each audio file is named by a number and nothing that can indicate which area in the game it takes place in. I guess I also would like to know if there is a program that can convert music files into a spd/spt format so that I can replace the songs in the iso. I've found a program that rips the audio's but I'm not really sure how to use it. It is called SPTex and it is found here: [http://hcs64.com/vgm_ripping.html](http://hcs64.com/vgm_ripping.html). Any help with this would be greatly appreciated.
