- Post Title: [Request] Bridge Constructor

Hi,

this is my first post here, even if I'm following this forum since a long time!
And for this first post, I would like to ask for your knowledge and give a try to this indy game called "Bridge Constructor". [https://www.facebook.com/BridgeConstructor](https://www.facebook.com/BridgeConstructor) (yep, no official website, just a damn facebook page).
A really simple but also funny and addictive game, where you have to build your bridge with some limited ressources and use your creativity.

Well, that being said, I've finished this game and now I would like to have some more fun with it, like editing the gravity, the limits, the textures, ... 
But so far, I've not seen any tools nor mods for this game (once again, it is an indy game, so not as popular as AAA games).

Here is a .zip file with some files from the game : [https://www.wetransfer.com/dl/48fX6h2B/ ... ac127b6221](https://www.wetransfer.com/dl/48fX6h2B/f0926fe7c020dda8e4f436e0ad46ed34c141da89d917d1b283e9654156748aed9d26aac127b6221)

The "Data" folder of the game contains "level0, level1, level2, ..." files, with no extention, each one has a size of 1 ko up to 714 ko.
Also there is a lot of "sharedassets.assets" files, from "sharedassets0.assets" to "sharedassets41.assets", with filesize going from 1 ko to 77864 ko.
There also is a "Managed" folder within the "Data" folder, with .dll files, such as "UnityEngine.dll", "System.Core.dll", etc.

Thanks a lot in advance for any information and possible unpack/repack tool. It is a really cool game, give it a try!

Well, that's too bad. Thanks for this quick answer, sir.
I hope soon there will be a way to edit games based on the Unity3D engine!
