- Post Title: FIFA 11 - Possible squad editor?

With the squad update came various changes to players appearances. If this data is contained in one single file (Squads), then surely if someone can figure out a way to open up the file we may be able to manually change things such as the Boots, Hair styles etc.

This is just a thought as this stage, and I have looked into whether or not there are editors out there such as this, but found no results.
