- Post Title: Extracting encrypted sounds.dat from an unknown game

Hello,
When I was deleting old files from my external drive, I found 1 sounds.dat file, I know that there are a lot of great sounds in ogg or wav format, but I can't tell what game it is.
Maybe someone would like to try to decrypt the file?
I will be very grateful for your help, and I put the file on my server and provide link below:
