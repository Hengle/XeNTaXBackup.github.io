- Post Title: Dissidia NT Steam Unknown Compressed Data

Because the main topic its more focus on the PS4 & model.
I decide make this separate one for the Steam unknown data.

So far, nobody has being able to unpack the data of the Steam, neither here or on Zenxax.

In my case, haven't get much luck. Besides, as I say before, I'm more interested for get the CG video data more than the models (IF someone have that data of the PS4 version).



Sorry for my bad english too.
