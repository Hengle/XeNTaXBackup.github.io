- Post Title: Lords of the fallen audio files

I managed to extract a bunch of ogg files from the file called audio_shared_streamed.fsb. however I can't seem to figure out how to convert or play them, or even what kind of audio file they are within the ogg container. I was wondering if anyone here could help me Identify them and/or figure out a method of converting them to a playable filetype. 
The audio_shared_streamed.fsb archive as well as the tool I used to extract it is inside the following zip file

the file comes from the pc game Lords of the fallen

This tool works just fine on any FSB OGG Vorbis files.

I compiled the .EXE for 32-bit only. So no need to put 64-bit DLLs with it.

But if you think 64-bit version may work faster, I can build them too.

It seems it would be way too hard to configure the compiler for 64 bits. I'm not going to do it. Sorry, I thought that must be easier.
