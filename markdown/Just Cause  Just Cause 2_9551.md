- Post Title: Just Cause / Just Cause 2

I'm about to complete a Unpakke module for "Just Cause 2", so i need someone who own that game, and can help me test the pre/packing.

1. what I'm looking for, is a guy who can first unpack some of the game archives (I'll provide him with the tools needed)
2. change something form the contents - image, text, etc.
3. pack the archives back (again tools will be provided)
4. run the game to see if the changes works.

* Everyone involved in the testing will be credited in the module's readme file.

P.S.
I'm also looking for someone who can test the same thing for the first game - "Just Cause"

I've publish an experimental module for the "Just Cause 2" TAB/ARC files, and another one for the SARC files.

Any feedback will be appreciated.

I've got your unpacker working. Is there any converter for the rbm files that you know of?

I'm not familiar with the format, sorry. Maybe it's a good idea to create a new thread for the RBM's and the rest of the game formats?

Sorry for pulling an old thread, but i've just released a module for the first "Just Cause" game.
