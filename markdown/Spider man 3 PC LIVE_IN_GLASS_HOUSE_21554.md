Hi everyone  
Firstly I'm from poland then sorry for my english, secondly I opened game.exe in HxD to search for code responsible for invisible wall and I found 2 lines of code  "LIVE IN GLASS HOUSE" that was used in ultimate spider man and with game.ini easly could turn off but in spider man 3 game.ini isn't working then i tried copy debug files from spider man 3 xbox 360 debug version and as suspected it doesn't worked either, even I opened files from scorpion mission because there invisible wall is disabled but found nothing.

There is anyone who tried to disable invisible walls in this game?
