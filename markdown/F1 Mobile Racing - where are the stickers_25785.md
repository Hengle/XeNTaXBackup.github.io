- Post Title: F1 Mobile Racing - where are the stickers?

Hello everyone! 
I was looking in the game files of EA's F1 Mobile Racing, which has really good models of 2022 F1 cars. They're Unity files, so it's extremely easy to rip models and textures. However, the complete models only seen to have plain liveries without sponsors. There are folders named "tattoos", but there are only texture files containing all the sponsor stickers on a transparent background, there's no 3d mesh to apply them. Would you please help me figure this out? Thank you!

Sounds like the stickers could be applied with a 2nd or so uv channel... iirc the stickers on codemasters f1 games work like this
