Alright so im doing a little mod project, I want to take the game BLACK and make a newer HD version for pc. I want to add some extra levels and some other things alike. But Id like to keep some things from the original source that made it so great. The gun animations, sounds, and 3d models, I figure HUD elements will be easy enough to grab, and to make a new general build of the game layout won't be too tough either in UDK or something. So Ive got the game, and im trying to extract the files off the disc on make sense of them in blender, but of course blender wont have it. Theres 8 foulders of the root of the disc, in which one hold the files for guns. the gun file extensions are .WDO, does anyone know how to get the info I want out of these files? I've seen the 3d Ripper dx, would that be my best option, or is there a way to load this up in an emulator and get the emulator to dump the files for me?
