Could I get a little help on opening Xsyons model files? I have tried countless model viewes with no luck 
Any help would be appreciated.
Thanks.

Another little bump after talking to the devs I have been told they use 3dMax 9 and Photoshop for textures Not sure if this will help out with opening the files?
Thanks for any replys.
