Long story short; i'm a Dark Eldar tabletop player.
Dark Eldar have been added to WH40K Inquisitor Martyr.
I'm good with 3D models, terrible at extracting / ripping models.
I want those models.

I'm not sure if this is the place to offer commission work but i'm willing to cough up benjamins to back up this request. A simple static, T-posed .obj with UV maps and textures is all I need, no need for skeleton / rigging since I do that myself.

Am I doing this right..?!
