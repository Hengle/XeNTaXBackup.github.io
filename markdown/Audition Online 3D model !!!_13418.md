- Post Title: Audition Online 3D model !!!

Hi ! Im new on the forum and i need your help...
Well it will be like days that i want to open audition 3D model but it seems that i can't...
The audition 3D model are ".rgm" files and nowadays we can open them, chinese people can do it thanks to a script that i have ( a script that permit us to load rgm from 3ds max) the problem is that i don't work for me when i try to import an audition .rgm file to 3ds max i have an intense freeze and i have to shutdown my computer lol ! 

If anyone have idea how can i open RGM it would be extremly kind....

Regards,

ps : rgm is both animation and 3d model

Someone on the discord was inquiring about writing a new file for this game as they had some plugin source code but some issue. the person wasn't able to share the source code so I ended up reversing the format myself so that I would be able to read and write models to the format.

Anyway here is a incomplete script, it only parses the file but the blocks are not researched so I dont know what anything means.
Hopefully it serves a a baseline for anyone wanting to write a (open source) plugin in the future

Thanks for sharing this! What more info would you need to complete the plugin? The Audition community would be blessed to have the tool to edit such files. I'm happy to provide more info you might need on completing the script..

Hello 
I just wanted to let you guys know that we have our own audition 3D community.
If you are interested to join, just contact me.

mariokart64n helped the audition community so so much and we all want to thank him for all he did for us
