- Post Title: Wipeout (1995) track UVs

Hello,

I'm looking for info on Wipeout 1 (1995) and found this very useful website [http://rewiki.regengedanken.de/wiki/Wipeout](http://rewiki.regengedanken.de/wiki/Wipeout) , it seems the regular models are stored in the PRM files but the track models however are in .TRF (for track faces), TRV (track vertices) and the textures are in TIM files but I didn't find anything about track UVs, does anyone know where they're stored ?

Thanks
