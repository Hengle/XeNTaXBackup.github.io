Dissidia 012 Duodecim Final Fantasy [PAL] DOS tool

How to:-This tool will extract & repack all files from PACKAGE.BIN PAL only....

1.Extract the ripkit folder (with winrar) & put your PACKAGE.BIN into the same folder(extracted with UmdGen) and run the Run_me.bat and press 1,This will then extract the files to an extracted folder.
2.Then downsample or modify your files but keep the same name & type, if the files are bigger it will not be added.If the files are smaller this tool will pad out to the original size.
3.Run the Run_me.bat and press option 2 this will then inject the files back in!!Remember the file PACKAGE.BIN will be the same size as the original because of the padding(Put the PACKAGE.BIN back in using UmdGen or WQSG_UMD_R31)
4.When you cso your iso it will be smaller!!
