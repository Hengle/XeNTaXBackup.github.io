- Post Title: "Color map" textures

Hello,
I would like to learn more about these textures. They're usually pink, blue and green and from what I can understand they're used to color specific parts of a texture by taking individual R, G and B channels and multiplying them by a color. Unfortunately I don't know what phrase to search for to get some information about them. So if anyone knows what their real name is, or if you have some more in-depth information about them, please let me know.

Valve seems to have something similar for Dota 2 called a shader mask. While the masks differ from game to game, you may find some similarities. See [this PDF file](http://media.steampowered.com/apps/dota2/workshop/Dota2ShaderMaskGuide.pdf) for details.
