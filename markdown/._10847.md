I never said it reads plain uncompressed files i said you need to repack them as uncompressed pkg files which should be very simple for you to do.

You mean the general pkg files that contain USRDIR or something..?
Or just recompress the uncompressed files(bin files) to pck file via
quick bms which is used to split original pkg to dat or tbl files?

Someone needs to make an app or script to create a new pkg file that contains the text files uncompressed inside.

it can not because the new files will be bigger then the old files.
You can use that as a template to make your own script for repacking.
just set the size and zip size to the same value.

Ar.. Is it hard to make bms script? I'm not the one who made above script.

No it's not.
In general, the pkg files of PS3 or VITA contain USRDIR and EBOOT.bin.,etc.
But the pkg files of sen no kiseki is not the normal pkg files.
It contains gamedata. And can not extracted from all of the pkg tools.

Just start with repacking ui.pkg
just copy the entire header to  anew blank file in a hex editor (0 - 0x2D8)
then paste the entire uncompressed files one after another in order at the end of the file (Only 9 files)
Then you will have to update the file table by hand
example 
battle_menu.dat
E8 01 00 00 - Uncompressed Size
E3 00 00 00 - Compressed Size
D8 02 00 00 - File Offset
01 00 00 00 - Compression Flag

Now for the first file you only need to change
E3 00 00 00 
into
E8 01 00 00
Also set Compressed flag to 
00 00 00 00 

The rest of the files you will do the same copy the uncompressed size over the compressed size.
But you must also update the tarting offset
In this case the 2nd file would start at
D8 02 00 00 + E8 01 00 00
which is
C0 04 00 00

If you want to mod it that badly make a simple script to do this or manually do it with a hex editor.
You can test with this small file by hand.




On a side note you tried creating a directory called ui and placing the extracted files in there and deleting the original pkg?
