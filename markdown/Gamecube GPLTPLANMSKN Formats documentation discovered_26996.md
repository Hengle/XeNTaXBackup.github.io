- Post Title: Gamecube GPL/TPL/ANM/SKN Formats documentation discovered

hello folks, just wanted to make this post because I've found from poking at internet archives a lot of documentation on how 3dsmax had a library for converting models to the gamecube's .gpl format, which is huge for me, because I was always wanting to rip some models from some small obscure games like harvest moon a wonderful life but there was just nothing for it

I found a zip file full of example models, pdfs, and text files to accompany them that appear to fully document and describe all the data inside the gpl model it was with 



that seems kinda huge tbh!

Knowing this, I wonder if there was anyone interested in perhaps writing some sort of script to view these models in something like noesis or blender perhaps, i know the original documents and stuff was for 3dsmax, but thats not really accessible for everyone, so i was kinda hoping someone might be able to help whip something up for Blender if possible

here's the zip file i found on the internet archives that goes over all of this if anyone wanted to see any of the documentation of example files:

Secondly I don't want to be a grouch but apart from the models I don't see too much helpful. No one would spend the time to make the sources run.
But there's sources for actor, anim and skinning which might be worth to have a glimpse into.

With this said here's a point cloud from viper.gpl which looks like a model:
