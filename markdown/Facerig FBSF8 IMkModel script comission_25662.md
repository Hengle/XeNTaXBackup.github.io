- Post Title: Facerig FBSF8 IMkModel script comission

I recently got the facerig archives extracting using offzip.

Textures are DDS but models appear to be proprietary format, .FBM and .FBS.
Both types have the starting hex data "FBSF8 IMkModel (x64) (build 4130, rev #57089 for Holotech Studios - Dec 15 2015)", which I cannot find any info on and lack the expertise to analyse.

I have packed and unpacked samples here <Link removed due to site policy>
"DATA_FLORAN unpacked using offzip.7z" contains the models and textures.

I am willing to pay/commission for a working script.

Thank you in advance.
