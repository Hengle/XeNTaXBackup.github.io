- Post Title: SAO Alicization Lycoris 3D Models

I'm looking to extract the 3D models from the PC version of Sword Art Online Alicization Lycoris
I've gotten as far as unpacking the data.CPK and have successfully converted sound files to usable formats (.acb -> .adx)
However, the model files (and a few other files) are unnamed filetype. I asked someone I knew and they took a look into the files with a Hex Editor and neither they nor I could not determine the filetype.
If it's any hint, the Map object models are .dae.phyre.
These are some of the extracted files [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Tz9hlxadt2ZFQ99DRmSV9hUQrCA8ZVq2?usp=sharing)
