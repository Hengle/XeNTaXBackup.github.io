Someone, please, write a script on importing 3d models and animations from Starship Troopers.
The script can be written for any 3D editor (3ds Max, Blender, MilkShape 3D or other), the main thing for me is that the script correctly imported 3D model and animation.
Very much you I ask, please, there is no place for me to address on this question any more.
I think these file formats are not too complicated for decoding, but I do not know anything about it.

Here all the models and animation from Starship Troopers.

3D Object Converter does not correctly display models of beetles, people, technology, weapons.

P.S. Sorry for my English. I use a translator.

I know that 3D Object Converter imports only 3D models. Screenshots of models in 3D Object Converter showed only for an example.

I need a normal script with the ability to import animations. Without animations 3D models will always be displayed not normally.

How can I ask the author of this program to add the Starship Troopers script?

Could someone help me ask him?
