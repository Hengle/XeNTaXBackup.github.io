- Post Title: Oddworld: Munch's Oddysee HD - PS3 Models

Hello, everyone! I've been going through a list of old projects I had and unfortunately came to a dead end when I couldn't figure out how to rip the models and textures from Oddworld: Munch's Oddysee HD.  The only thing I found besides shaders (stored in .cgb format) and sounds (stored in .vag format) is a file approximately 250 MB large, titled "data_en.pak". I tried extracting it but I obtain only cover art. Does anyone know what to do? Thank you for your time!   
Here's the file: [https://mega.nz/#!EB5xWACZ!OUafzODOhGYj ... RnMp_lC--0](https://mega.nz/#!EB5xWACZ!OUafzODOhGYjBZD4ln37QWGfPEBdqaeKORnMp_lC--0)
