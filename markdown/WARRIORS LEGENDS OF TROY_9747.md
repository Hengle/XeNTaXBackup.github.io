Hello everyone good'm new to the forum, thank you in advance for your help. And excuse my English

I have some game models WARRIORS: LEGENDS OF TROY, are compressed in a format called mpkg, and my question is does anyone know I can unzip or indicate a tool to do so, the game models would be something.













I again thank you in advance for your help, thanks.
