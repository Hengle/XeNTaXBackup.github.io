- Post Title: Hot Shots Golf: Out of Bounds SGB files?!

So, like a few other PS3 games, this game has SGB audio files in it, and they are meant to be multiple ways to get these to work, like renaming them to AC3, using vgmstream, and so on, but none of these have worked, and i'm not sure if i'm doing something wrong or if these are unique SGB files, I know for a fact they actually have the music because when imported as raw data into Audacity, it's horrible and distorted but I can hear the melody of the actual song in it, i'm just wondering how to go about this because i've always wanted this games soundtrack, that isn't on YouTube, I would really appreciate help, thank you!
