- Post Title: GRID 2 *.nfs Audio files

hello, i found that the muiscs in GRID 2 are really awesome. So I try to take a look of the music file.
It located in GRID2 main folder\audio\soundbanks,named music.nfs. But I can't find any tool to unpack 
the files,so can anyone take a look with the .nfs audio files and makes a script to unpack??
MANY THANKS!!!and sorry for my bad English...  

here is image of hex editor,the file has a "NeFS" heading

also i have uploaded another smaller nfs files for example because music.nfs is 350MB big.

I just went back and checked an nfs file from Dirt 3, and it's a different format to GRID 2. I tried the nfsdecode code against it too.
