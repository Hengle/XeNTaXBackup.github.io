- Post Title: Inkle ink script localized

I know i can edit json file with notepad ++, but i have a problem that when editing such a large file, it will be very laggy
I wonder if there is a tool that can export and import the text to be translated
I found a tool but it doesn't seem to have an input function and I don't know how to use it
Here is tool: [https://github.com/YongHeeK/InkLocalizer.jl](https://github.com/YongHeeK/InkLocalizer.jl)
Is there a way or is there another tool?  Someone please help me ðŸ¥ºðŸ¥ºðŸ¥º
