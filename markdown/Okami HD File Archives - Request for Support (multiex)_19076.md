- Post Title: Okami HD File Archives - Request for Support (multiex)

(Deleted old post, moved to here as the wiki directs game requests here.)

Hey there, I hope you guys can help. I've been trying to get into this game for awhile, reacharounds haven't been working very well so this is my last resort. I feel bad asking like this, so if there's any other way I can help I would. I kinda want to ask how you guys get support for these in the first place, but that can be saved for another time, or more digging to be found.

Anywho! Okami HD files, I had to split them up a bit. I wanted to give you guys a taste of each file type for maximum support, so I decided to make different archive samples of different sizes. Trying to make small ones is difficult, I feel like some of these files require other files from other folders to support it, which are all put in the biggest file. But the wiki also says to keep it under 1mb, so I'll have multiple options out.

Heck, even if there's 50% support for multiex I'd be pretty happy.

Even Smaller Sample Archive - 21 kb.

Extensions in this archive:

	.dat
	.pac
	.bin

(download embedded in post)
These are files most requested for I've noticed, for support, so I tried the smallest of each type.

Small Sample Size for the experts:

I tried to include even more, standalone file samples that may not require other files to work. Unfortunately, the devs pack a lot inside each one. 47161 KB

Extensions used in the sample:

	.dat
	.pac
	.csv
	.vsq
	.bin
	.usm

Lastly, the big one, I tried to include the most important files.

	.dat
	.usm
	.ses
	.afd
	.afs2
	.chp
	.bin
	.adx
	.pac
	.vsq
	.idd
	.csv
	.acf
	.cip

It's in separate parts and until there's definite interest, I put part 1 on mediafire, so you can take a look. If there's parts that you think don't belong but other parts you need, I can make a special archive for that. 

Part 1: 102,400 kb

[http://www.mediafire.com/file/q5393qtqj ... 1.rar/file](http://www.mediafire.com/file/q5393qtqjozatnn/sample_files_for_the_experts.part01.rar/file)

Each Read-Me has information for which folder each file came from.


I've taken a look at other forum posts, but I don't know how they even find support through Noesis itself. Besides that, a few friends and I really want to start creating mods for this game, and quickbms/noesis is far too complicated for them, and I feel like I could teach them multiex, it's fairly easy.

Thanks in advance.

(if download links look weird in this forum, let me know, media fire has a forum-imbed option)
(edit: forgot to write size of part 1 download)
