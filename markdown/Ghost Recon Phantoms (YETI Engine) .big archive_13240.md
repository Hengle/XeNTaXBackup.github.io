- Post Title: Ghost Recon: Phantoms (YETI Engine) .big archive

Hello guys!
I returned to this game, in order to finish my model-import script for 3ds max.

Unfortunately, script I used to extract yeti.big archive (where everything is stored), doesn't extract most of the files, just few % of entire archive. 
[http://aluigi.altervista.org/papers/bms/yeti_ybig.bms](http://aluigi.altervista.org/papers/bms/yeti_ybig.bms)
So, I'm kindly asking if someone could help me out with this, and extract all game files from .big archive. Thanks in advance!
Here's the sample

I'm not sure so we can do something better like this script.

Thanks a lot for looking into this Ekey  That's a bit sad, since this game has nice content, weapons and armor customization.
But at least we can get some models already:)

@Zaramot

"Textures are plain .dds files, just remove first 12 bytes and paste .dds dxt1 ot dxt5 header. I'm working on texture converter, though maybe it will take time for me to finish it."

When you said that, what do you meant? The extracted "dds" files are just a bunch of mess, if I delete the first 12 bytes and insert a new dxt header, the result just a rainbow

Maybe they changed archive? Since it's MMO developers could do that, so after extraction you're now getting compressed texture for example. Attach one texture here I'll take a look
