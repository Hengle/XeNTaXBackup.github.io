- Post Title: HGM and HGA files for 3d models

Hi all,

I am having trouble trying to get the core assets of this winamp visual plugin.

When I install it dumps a bunch of .pak files which I can extract using winrar.
Amongst the pak files are script files in LUA and XML.
There are also shader *.fx files 
There is a model pak with *.hgm files and a bunch of dds, tga files in an animation pak, the later of which can be opened 

[http://www.hirahira.net/cgi-bin/HiraHir ... Trial.html](http://www.hirahira.net/cgi-bin/HiraHiraNet/download_counter/downcon.cgi?down=http://www.hirahira.net/products/ringoTrial/ringoTrial_v5.zip&name=ringoTrial_v5.zip&hp=http://www.hirahira.net/products/ringoTrial/downloadTrial.html)

I am just wondering if anyone can help me out with the model and animation files to see if they can be converted back to their original format which I am hoping are something that can opened with a 3d model editor like max etc..

Kind regards and my thanks in advance
