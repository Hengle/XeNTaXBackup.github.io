- Post Title: Papers, Please! language pack .zip files

Hi there!

An update came out to Papers, Please! which includes language packs. We can freely create our own, and I started making a translation for the game, yet when I try to .zip the files in it doesn't work.

I tried opening the .zip files with 7-zip instead of WinRAR, and I noticed that there's a folder with absolutely no characters in it, and it appears as "\" in 7-zip.

Let me demonstrate it with 2 pictures:



Here you can see that the folder has "no name".

Here you can see that on the top bar where the file's address is that it just appears as a "\"


How can I create an archive like this? I realised that I only need to "Store" files, but I still can't create this folder, and if I try to edit any of the .zip archives then any file that I add becomes "Archived", "Deflated" or something like that, and it isn't "Stored". The game also writes an error on the screen stating that some files are archived and it's not supported.

Any ideas on what to do? I don't know if I can include the english text/zip file here, but it's given to anyone who owns the game/wants to translate it.



EDIT: Okay, I figured it out. Turns out I accidentally compressed the english text files instead of the translated ones, and my translation worked already *epic facepalm*

Still it intrigues me how to create an archive like this (it works now via a simple "Stored" files as .zip archive, but still...)

With 7zip, you can just create a normal zip from a folder and then clear the name of the folder in the zip file (rename + backspace).
