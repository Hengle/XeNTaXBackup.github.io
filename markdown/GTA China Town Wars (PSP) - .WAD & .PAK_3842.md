- Post Title: GTA China Town Wars (PSP) - .WAD & .PAK

Hi everyone, im new to this kinda stuff so please excuse me if i say n00b things lol. And if i have posted this in the wrong place. 

ive been nosing around my GTA:CTW disc trying to find out where or how the textures are stored and i found a a fair amount of audio and video files (.at3 and .bik) and a couple of large 100mb+ files, 2 with .PAK extenstions and 1 with .WAD. ive spent many hours searching google and found loads of tools that can open these extenstions from other games but none that can open the GTA ones.

So i opened them up with Frhed hex editor and basically found alot of mumbo jumbo with lots of space inbetween it.  So i have since used CWCheat for the psp to dump the psp ram, i have searched the dump using game extractor 2.0 and again there was nothing found inside the dump (i had previousely scanned a dump of WWE Smackdown vs Raw 2010 and found a couple of .png images) so i opened up the GTA dump with Frhed and found some (in my eyes) intresting stuff altho i now have no idea what i could do with the stuff found. The stuff i found instresting was some of file names of files which as far as i can work out are included in the .wad file as they are not found anywere else on the disc, There are to many files to list but here are a few of them. 

SS_Radar.bin
HES.bin
SS_MissOverviewCHAN.bin
SS_MissOverviewHSIN.bin
SS_MissOverviewZHOU.bin
SS_MissOverviewBIK.bin
SS_MissOverviewMOB.bin
SS_MissOverviewXIN.bin
SS_MissOverviewMEL.bin
SS_Windows.bin
SS_HOTWIRE_EASY.bin
SS_HOTWIRE_MED.bin
SS_HOTWIRE_HARD.bin
SS_Dumpster.bin
SS_SNIPERIFLE.bin
SS_SNIPERARROWS.bin

and this very long one:
ObjectPickupDynamicCollisionMeshExplosionParticleEmittersPedPlayersVehicleDynPropDynLightattractorsSegregatedLimbSmokegarages.dat

I will attached a files list from the umd. incase that may be of any help. 
Ive also uploaded the dump i made with cwcheat incase u would like to have a look yourself. I can upload Any of the files in the file list if requested (because of the size of them). 

So finally my question is. how can i get these files out of the .WAD and .PAK files to hopefully view, edit or replace them. 
Which is hopefully where some people on here could help.

The ram dump will not help without having an original pac and wad file.
