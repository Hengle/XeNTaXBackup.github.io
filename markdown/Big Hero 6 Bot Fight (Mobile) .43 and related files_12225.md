This game uses the Unity engine, and the models (what I think are the models) are in .43 format. When searching up the format on Google, I came across a thread on here that was discussing another Unity mobile game that uses this format (some kind of Fast & Furious game), and when I downloaded the 3DSMax plugin and used it on the Big Hero 6 models, it kept getting error messages.

Is there anything you guys could do to help me out?

Thanks in advance.

Thanks! That helped so much!

But now I'm having trouble trying to export the textures. I make it open the folder where the .pvr textures are stored, and nothing happens...

EDIT: Ignore that last part, I figured out a different way to export Unity textures.
