- Post Title: [PC ] Secret of Mana remake OST, how to make sab files

Hi!

I'm looking into replacing .sab files from the Secret of Mana remake with remix versions. I was able to read said file with foobar2000 and VGMstream, that helps identifying each song. Now I'm stuck I have no idea how to use mp3s to generate new .sab files. Any clue on how to reverse the process please?

edit: I ran into file details, the codec is CRI HCA which is proprietary, there is also mention of  a Square-Enix SAB header, looks like it's not gonna be easy :s
