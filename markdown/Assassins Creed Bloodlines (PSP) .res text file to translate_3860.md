Could you please look at the *.res  file from Assassins Creed Bloodlines (PSP) - I think they contain the texts from the game

What about [Resource Hacker](http://www.angusj.com/resourcehacker/) or [Resource Hacker FX](http://rammichael.com/resource-hacker-fx)? I heard it can edit .res files.

Dunno if it'll work on a PSP game, but it's worth a try.
