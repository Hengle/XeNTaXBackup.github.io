- Post Title: Translate PS1 games (Extract .bin file)

Hey there guys!

Lately I thought of an interesting thing: I want to translate PS1 games. Now I know this is hard, but I'll write down what I've accomplished so far:

1. I need to extract the PS1 files from the disc, because it doesn't work via simple copy -> paste functions. I managed to do this by extracting it with IsoBuster.

2. I need to put the files back in, which I'll deal with later, as I've put the files back in using ImgBurn and various tricks, the game starts but freezes (it may or may not be the 3rd things fault that you can read below).

3. I noticed that most game text are inside .bin files. I know decrypting these are hard, and it would take many hours to code a program for it. I saw in Kagero - Deception II's KOKU_DAT.BIN file some text, I translated just a tiny sentence in it (using Hex Workshop), and saved it.

Now when I run the game, it simply fails to load, or if it loads, then it's buggy, and it hangs in one of the intro screens.

How can I translate a PS1 game so it's not bugged, runs fully EVEN ON PSP, and a REAL PS1 (not just emulators)?

Thanks in advance!

sorry but... it's diffucult.  PS1 and PS2 games are either in .ISO or .que .bin format.  it's easy to extract. but the hard part is to check out the files the games use. it's different depending on a game. in some games it actually is possible to translate it. via some easy other compressed file extracting.

Well for Kagero Deception 2 I know which file I need to translate, and it's a .bin file, and my problem is that I can't redo the ISO, because when I extract it it's bugged and messes up the files.

So it's like 350 mb big, I extract the files and it will be only 140 mb, so a lot of data is missing. How can I extract ALL the data?

If someone knows the answer, please reply, thanks in advance!
