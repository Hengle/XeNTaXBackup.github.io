- Post Title: Dragonball Online PAK Files

Hi,
I'd like to extract the pak files of the game Dragonball Online to make a english/german translation
of this game. I tried many different tools but not one tool was able to extract the text/script, textures and or sound files in those archives.

The following files are in the archive i uploaded to sendspace:
-flash0.pak
-gui0.pak (is just a plain text file, no need for extraction)
-obj0.pak
-tan.pak
-tbl0.pak
-terrain0.pak

Link to upload: [Click](http://www.sendspace.com/file/hp2fec)

I hope someone can help me to extract those archives.
And I wanted to ask if I can pack them again after I extracted them.

So Long
Dragula

So here i am again,
I found out that most of the files can be read in a hex editor, but i havent found the files i searched.
My opinion on this is that the files I am looking for are in the obj paks and those are encrypted.
Hope this will help a bit.

I hate to bump up an old thread but I was just about to make a thread on whether or not anyone knew how to dump 3D models or textures from this so I can take a look at them outside the game.
