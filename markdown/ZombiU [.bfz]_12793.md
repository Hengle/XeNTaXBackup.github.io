- Post Title: ZombiU [.bfz]

Probably similar to The Adventures of Tintin: Secret of the Unicorn(The Adventures of Tintin: The Game), Michael Jackson - The Experience, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Turtles in Time Re-Shelled but with differences.

ABE header, table with file names in the beginning.
Audio ripped to two parts: data in SndStream_Common_X.lin.bfz and headers in SoundHeaders.bin.

Few filecuts for research - [http://dropmefiles.com/ARPim](http://dropmefiles.com/ARPim)

Additional information:
- Several tables in the beginning.
- Filenames in the beginning
- Audio Format is SON. Header - SON RIFF WAVELySE
- Audio format isn't standart UbiSoft audio format with layers, etc. (DecUbiSnd dont find anything)
- AlphaTwentyThree's scan bms scripts dont work. (44 getDstring AREA_NAME 4)
- Dragon Unpacker can detect and rip RIFF WAVE data with Hyper Ripper, but they probably dont be playable. Founds over 4214 files(SndStream_Common_X.lin.bfz).
- Audition CS6 detects slices of not compressed samples, part looks like compressed. (2 samples - [http://dropmefiles.com/g50Ld](http://dropmefiles.com/g50Ld) ; shot - [http://i.imgur.com/ktp8Acl.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/ktp8Acl.jpg) )
