- Post Title: Where to start?...

Hey guys and sorry if I'm posting in the wrong section.


I was messing with some PSOne roms using Hex and psx-mode2 to import the file, so far, text-wise it works. But i wanted to know more...  

My question is: where to start digging these game files? can't wait for people to make tools for me, I wanna make them myself :p I have a basic understanding or programming, that's all. but I  keep hearing a lot of stuff (header, tables, routines, reverse engineering...etc) and I have no idea where to start...

What do you guys suggest?
