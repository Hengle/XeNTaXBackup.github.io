- Post Title: scarface (after extracting rcf) tapeplayer help!

Hello, this is my first post.
Im interested of scarface soundtrack
I have read that [post](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?t=2168) and followed the *steps but I still can't understand one thing. How do I search the ''header'' for ''tapeplayer''? I tried total commander to search the directory with rsd but it says no results found. That happens both in sound1.rcf's and sound2.rcf's extracted folder. I also tried rsd2ogg and after i finishing running it to seperate folders i found a total of 40-55 songs instead of 117 or something. I also tried to search that ''tapeplayer'' using windows search but still nothing. I tried search for the ''tapeplayer'' in wordpad but i can't understand anything there (everything is nonsense)
Can you tell me what im doing wrong? I really need that OST.

Help me please!
