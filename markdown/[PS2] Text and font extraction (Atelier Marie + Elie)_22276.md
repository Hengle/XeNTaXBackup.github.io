- Post Title: [PS2] Text and font extraction (Atelier Marie + Elie)

Hello everyone,

I would like to translate the game Atelier Marie + Elie from english to french. The game is quite old, and even after some extensive research, I didn't find any useful resources/tutorials about text extraction and insertion for PS2 games. The most forceful technique would be to modify directly all the text opening the ISO in some hexadecimal editor, but this is excruciatingly painful because I cannot change the length of my dialogues without making the whole ISO crash (even when simply deleting to compensate some seemingly harmless zeros) and furthermore, in french there are special characters (such as é, è, ê etc.) that obviously won't appear because the encoding/font are not correct.
That is why I am in desperate need for some tutorial or resources (I know these are scarce, unfortunately) to be able to do the standard stuff, in particular how to find the pointer table and how to extract and inject back the text. Any help/link would be extremely helpful, given that I simply never found anything clear and explicit for the whole pointer table stuff, for instance.
