- Post Title: Mdl model files HL2?

Hello, I found some world of tanks models on facepunch in mdl format. And I'm looking for how to use view these files. They seem to be version 44 half life 2 mdl's.

Do I need to have half life 2 and their sdk installed along with steam to use them in garrys mod ? 

Any other ways of using them ?

[Noesis](http://oasis.xentax.com/index.php?content=downloads) can view and convert .mdl models and .vtf textures into many different formats.

I love you very much !

Yes it does work but the models appear to be slightly messed up but just needs some cleanup work and they can be usable.Probably part of the conversion process is why they appear this way.

They do have bodygroups animations bones etc..

I use Deep Exploration to convert hl1 files, works perfectly with CS 1.6 models, no glitches or anything, and im pretty sure it works for any other hl1 engined games, since they all use the same file types, might work for hl2...

Does it handle hl 2 version 44 model format ? 

Noesis program loads all the meshes and eveything into a big pile inside program and doesnt export out the animations and other usefull stuff.Currently only the tracks become unusable, which isnt a big problem.

I currrently do not own half life 2 and the sdk from steam that would allow me to decomplie the mdl's properly into smd's.

I'll take a look at DE.

I just checked DE's website supported formats and hl2 mdl's arent in the list.

@op you seem to want to use them in gmod. For that matter you don't need to actually convert them to anything. Just drop them into the gmod directory or addon.

Also if you have gmod, it's best to use MDLdecompiler (it needs the source sdk though) this outputs to SMD and usually the only thing you have to do for it to load the mdl is a slight hex editing to change the version of the file.

If I went that route and needed to hex the model file since its version 44, which version would I need to downgrade it too ?

I currently dont own hl 2 or gmod but that is a option in near future.I can get the sdk from steam too.

The models were made for gmod and I tried to ask questions there on facepunch website about how to use them but some moderator banned me for a day just cuase I asked if I need to buy gmod which wasnt a problem. ;/ so ghey.

I am using the latest one, problem is, the mdls contains multiple meshes inside of it amd doesnt export them properly but they are usable with some work.
4 meshes bundled into them that i would like to export seperately but doesnt seem possible. Also doesnt seem to recognise vtf texture files.
