- Post Title: CASTLEVANIA LORD OF SHADOW II

[I created this post because I'm in a nameless galley]

And

So here, I want a plugin that allows to read the model Castlevania Lord Of Shadow II in blender.

ATTENTION: For Blender 2.76b Version

I own all models of Castlevania (character, item, creature, environment) format msh. 


I put at your disposal one link download for the model, Trevor (young) and Young Dracula:

If you manage to miraculously find a solution please let me know.

My goal is to import the users XNALARA

Thank you advance for your help.
