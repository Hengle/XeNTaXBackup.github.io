- Post Title: VolvoWrench

Hi, I have been programming this tool for quite a while and I would like to share it with you guys. It is a parser for ".sav" and ".dem" files for Valve made games. I hope you will find it usefull:

VolvoWrench
This is a tool for analyzing and working with source and goldsource save and demo files. I have been making this tool for quite a while but it is still in heavy development so expect frequent updates. Today is the first "stable" release so that's why I am only making this post about the tool now.

Features:

Parsing any source or goldsource engine demo.
Viewing demo files tick by tick so you can see what is happening in them.
Hotkey system.
Renaming demos to the corret naming scheme.
The whole project is up on [github](https://github.com/Traderain/VolvoWrench). You can get the newest version from [here](https://github.com/Traderain/VolvoWrench/releases).
Currently I won't have much time developing it but I would like to finish the save parser in 1-2 week. I will update this thread as soon as I do any major update.

In progress:

Demo doctor.
Parsing save files (nearly done).
Generating heatmaps from demos.
Exporting demo data as xml.
Auto update.
