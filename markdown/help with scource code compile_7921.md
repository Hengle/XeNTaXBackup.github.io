- Post Title: help with scource code compile

I recently received the source code for a model viewing program from a Chinese hacker. however I don't know how to go about compiling it since I was told part of it is outdated I wanted to ask if anyone knew how or where I could find out. the game is ace combat zero and the program was made by babywolf with addons by Oz01 (who game me it) and lotsbiss.

It looks as if any good program should handle it if the proper support files are installed.
I use 2 programs myself.
VS 2008 for C++ and Code Blocks set up to use the GNU GCC Compiler for straight C.

It looks like you may have part of a larger program. The full program can be found here: [http://code.google.com/p/topace/](http://code.google.com/p/topace/)
And the source code can be found here:
[http://topace.googlecode.com/svn/](http://topace.googlecode.com/svn/)

I'm not sure how to use the source code files but the TopAce program runs without any problems. It may be helpful to note that the program and code are written in Chinese.
