- Post Title: Scarface PSP: Money Power Respect

Hi,

Unlike the PC version, the PSP version of Scarface uses REZ files.

I tried to scan em for files with Jaub 2.0 but it took almost a day finding nothing.

With Game File Extractor also nothing usefull comes out. 

With Multi Ex commander, i got some images out of the archive but they are way too small (psp's resoluiton is 480x272) and screwed up.

Thanks for any help.

Perhaps you could give an example archive?

I'm sorry it's only one file that is 800 mb. And since Warez are forbidden here i can't supply you with the file.

Give me a suggestion to tear it in pieces and i will upload 

Also my hopes are a bit down since i read in the FAQ that Tron 2 REZ files can't be done. Maybe this file is the same or not ?
