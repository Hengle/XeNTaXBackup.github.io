> Hello everyone. I want to make translate silent hill origins, but I can not open files with text (string.Eng and etc.) Please tell me some tools to convert a string-file in txt and back. I know that this tool did Russian (http://consolgames.ru/soft/SH0Utils_ReadMe.txt), but they want 50$ (for me it is too expensive). Maybe someone has a similar program, help me, please. (HEX Editor Do not offer). Sorry for my bad English.
they wanted normal money from you.
I remember I wanted Red Dead Redemption ps3 translate tool program.They wanted 350$ from me.
search and look anywhere.of course someone will help you.
