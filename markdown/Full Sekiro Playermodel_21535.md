- Post Title: Full Sekiro Playermodel

Hello there, I was researching how to extract the entire Sekiro playermodel so I could use it for a school animation project. I've been reading a lot on here and other forums on how to do it. I've got some progress but I know it's gonna take me a lot of additional time and effort to do it by myself.
So I was wondering if anyone here has already extracted the entire model as a single file (like obj, stl, fbx for example)?
It would save me a lot of time if any of you had it.
