- Post Title: Robot Arena (PC) .GMF file

Digging around in an old PC game from around 2001, most of its files are just raw .bmp or .wav which makes it super easy to mess around with, however the models seem to be in a bin.gmf file. I've tried looking around for that extension and the only programs I can find that mention it are Leadworks Game Engine (which doesn't want to open it), and Applause CGM Graphics which I can find no info on.

Looking at the file in a hex editor it seems to list the filename with a .max extension near the start, but renaming it and pulling it into 3ds max doesn't do anything.

Sample file here [http://www.mediafire.com/file/31xiujaxh ... n.gmf/file](http://www.mediafire.com/file/31xiujaxhl9bh48/ch_type01_bin.gmf/file)
