- Post Title: FEAR 1 Tools

Yes before anyone moves this to trash or in case this is the wrong forum though I believe this to eb the correct one. I've looked at an couple of topics involving FEAR 1's rip tools.. and only found one script in 3ds max that could rip if not the weapons then the models. Unfortunately I still can't rip 40% of the models and then anytime I try to import the weapons it completely freezes my 3ds program. So I was wondering if anyone had an updated one for model00p/if there was another way now or if someone had the time to make a script and forgive me if I'm asking too much on a new script. Or I can just give you the one I have gotten from here and see if someone can update/fix it.
