Hi.

I want to do a fan made translation of this game

I want it because the english version NPUB31751_SAMURAI_WARRIORS_4-II doesnt have the RETAIL ISO version and i cant turn it to
ISO (to save space in my ps3 hdd)

I opened the ISO and i found:

LINKDATA_1ST.BIN
LINKDATA_2ND.BIN

and go on...mostly *.BIN files.

how or which tool do i need to open those files so i can see the pics and the TEXTs in order to start the translation in english?

hope someone can aid me.

Thank you

You need to provide a file sample or nobody can help.

Also this thread should have been posted in the Localisation sub forum.
