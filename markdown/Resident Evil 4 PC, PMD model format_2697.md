- Post Title: Resident Evil 4 PC, PMD model format

I've been around for a while, but never actually posted anything

Since PmData's RE2 model viewer is here as well, I thought I'd just add to the collection.

This program will allow you to export RE4's PMD model files as OBJ/MTL (Wavefront object) files, and also import OBJ/MTL's back into the game as PMD files.

Latest version downloads and screenshots are on the RE4 PC mod forums thread: HERE!



PMD to OBJ and loaded into Milkshape:
