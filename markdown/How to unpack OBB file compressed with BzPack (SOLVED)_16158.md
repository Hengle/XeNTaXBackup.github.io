- Post Title: How to unpack OBB file compressed with BzPack (SOLVED)

Recently i tried to open android game TrainCrasher OBB file, but no luck. Found BzPack header in file with hex. I searched for that compression format, but again, no luck. Maybe someone knows how, or have bms script to unpack this format.

Already tried this. Doesnt work. Any way, find bms script for that, but don't understand, why google can't find it earlier.. You can find it in [HERE](http://aluigi.altervista.org/bms/bzpack.bms)
