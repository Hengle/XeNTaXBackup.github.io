Do you just want the music or do you want a full audio dump from the game?

[Here is all the music from Ori and The Blind Forest](https://mega.nz/#!z4NWSTyC!z58mozRZf-AjQuYT9MV_Nia7PWgolhxyEYZee4APryo)

The password to extract the archive is: The Light of Nibel

You'll need to use this [FSB Audio Extractor](https://mega.nz/#!HkEFECYD!LSG-USc6ag_dIVYVEqkvVkNogkpPgwHm3WS8We9Xjrc) as well.

Just copy all the files from the FSB Audio Extractor tool into the same folder as the FSB audio files and run the Batch.bat file and it will convert convert them from .FSB into PCM WAV files for you
