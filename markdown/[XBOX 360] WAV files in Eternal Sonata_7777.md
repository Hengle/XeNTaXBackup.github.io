- Post Title: [XBOX 360] WAV files in Eternal Sonata

WAV endian converter


Game: Eternal Sonata (aka Trusty Bell), XBox 360 version
Author: 0xFAIL
Version: 0.1-20111129

Changes endianess for standard WAV files (all floats + ints) found
in the game.

The game contains around 700 MB of those WAV files (suspiciously UNDER the maximum amount of a CD).
They are the piano music played in between the chapters, they probably just ripped them off the 'official'
OST but kudos for using lossless audio for piano music, somebody has a taste for classical music at Tri-Ace.
