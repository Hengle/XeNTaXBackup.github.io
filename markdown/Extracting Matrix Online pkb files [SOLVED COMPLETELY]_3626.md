UPDATE:   !!!PROBLEM SOLVED COMPLETELY!!!

Ok, copy packmap_save.lta (filetable/parsetable) and extractor.exe
into your mxo\packmaps folder and run extractor.exe, that will take care of all pkb-s.

Good job rajkohaxor, thank you!!!

(these packs have good sound effects (like hl jack in) for receiving text. lol  )
plus you've got all the textures and models, you do need some file editing for these latter,
here is some advice on that:

ORIGINAL QUESTION
Hi,

as you probably know this game is closed, so we fans have no more chance to enjoy our games beloved content,
so we like to archive as much things from the game as possible, however everything seems to be packed in these
.pkb files. The funny thing is, that it looks like this is not even a special format, as in the case of sound files
a pkb looks like as a single giant multiple-wav file, as the first wav in the file plays via mediaplayer, but its a 1 sec long
sound effect and the other wavs are just stringed to its end but they are not playable (by wmp). 
Most likely the other pkb-s for the textures and everything, are probably different type of files,
and maybe compressed.

Anyhow here are some archetypical pkb-s of the smaller ones (there are some 122 megabyte ones too, I can upload them
if there is a request)

[..EXAMPLE FILES REMOVED AS PROBLEM SOLVED...]

please guys help our community to extract these files!

thank you so much!

PS:
If anyone have an idea where to turn for asking help to crack the game and setting up private servers, please share the information!

You can use a simple format scanner for those files - the sound container has no compression.
Try Turfsters extractor: [http://turvy.dommel.be/FileStripper.rar](http://turvy.dommel.be/FileStripper.rar)

Thre is no filetable inside this container

I tried the stripper, it says 

Checking for log file...
No log file found.

EDIT: ITS OK LOL  I SET THE WRONG EXTRACTION PATH, BUT IT WORKS NOW THANK YOU!!!!!

EDIT2:
