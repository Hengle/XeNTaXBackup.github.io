- Post Title: Question re: XFBIN and NUCC Files

Hello there! This is my first post on this forum, so I apologize if I'm violating any rules.

I am trying to peek through the files of .hack//VERSUS, and extract whatever text/UI I can (for some translation work). I've gotten a few things but I can't seem to figure out how to unpack files that are in .nucc format (and how to unpack various other .xfbin files).

I searched around and couldn't find any information regarding these files. The furthest I've gotten was extracting some models + textures that were in .cpk format with quickbms + cpk.bms and renaming the resulting .nuc file into an .xfbin so it's readable by Noesis. I've managed to get sound effects too, but it feels like everything I want is just out of reach haha.

I would be immensely grateful if anyone could help me sort through this!
If you need any examples of the files I'm having trouble sorting through, let me know and I'll attach them in a post.
