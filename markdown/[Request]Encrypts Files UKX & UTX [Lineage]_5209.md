- Post Title: [Request]Encrypts Files UKX & UTX [Lineage]

Hi all such good as the title says I try to protect my files so I will not steal the work of extracting the textures and 3D models of my server and a lot of work and then walk contribution in forums and would not something that is unique to the server, use several applications which do not serve me but I have to make customers take my new encryption to load normally without any problem, you can because there are people who did it but clearly not give me answers and people who know me know how much help over the years in Lineage, well please if anyone can help or just send me a PM with the answer I'd appreciate it before hand thank you very much and I hope your answers Greetings.
