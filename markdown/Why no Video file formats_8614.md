- Post Title: Why no Video file formats?

While there are "Audio/Graphic file formats" I'm curious why there's no sub-forum for research & development of tools aimed at video files? 

Nobody cares about them? (find it hard to believe) or everyone goes to other places for such things?

Hmm. We can start a subforum and see if it works out. I think it was assumed that it would fall into the Graphics catergory.

Thanks for giving it a shot, should be worth a try I think.

I'd be interested in what kind of things devs do with their videos.

Do they write their own codecs?
Do they just screw around with encryption/compression?

I believe codecs can be developed in-house or by an external company. For example games from Namco: Tekken4,5,Death by Degrees used some proprietary codec that is still hasn't been cracked yet. I can't remember right now for sure but in Death by Degrees there was a small file containing all names for cinematics, with an extension .IPP I believe. 
Another example: majority of Gamecube games use h4m format developed by Hudson (a software technology company) for that platform. 
It appears that most of the time game developers take what's already available on the market and encode their videos into that format, but there are case when they come up with own stuff.
