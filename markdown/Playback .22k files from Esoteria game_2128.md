- Post Title: Playback: *.22k files from Esoteria game

So, there's this reall old game (1997) called Esoteria, and it stores its sound in the form of [22k](http://wiki.xentax.com/index.php/Esoteria_22K) files.  I've managed to crack these open with Game Extractor and MultiEx Commander, revealing about a thouand un-associated files.  Now, I am stuck.  How do I remove the music from these files, and convert it to a playable format?  I really dig the music, though the game hardly works any more.

Because I'm not a programmer of any kind, I still have this problem achieving, say, .mp3 from the 22k files in Esoteria.

I've extracted 1100 unassociated files ranging from 4 bytes to 1814 kb, all named "noname###" in no particular order, as far as my untrained eye can see.
