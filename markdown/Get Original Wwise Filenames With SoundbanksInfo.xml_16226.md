- Post Title: Get Original Wwise Filenames With SoundbanksInfo.xml

Hi! Games that use the Wwise Sound Engine mostly have a SoundbanksInfo.XML which stores the original filenames of the sounds (because they are originally named with IDs like 6039102.wav). Is there any way to use this file in order to rename all the sounds with their proper names? It would be useful when there are A LOT of sounds to rename. Thanks.

It is very simple, I already did it several times for Far Cry 3, Sleeping Dogs, and Rising Storm 2. You don't need to know anything about filetypes, just basic programming.

However, different games have different xml files. Can you post it?
