- Post Title: 3D Ripper DX problems [3D Studio Max 2015]

Okay, so the 3D Ripper's "3dr" file importer plugins don't work in 3D Studio Max 2015, just the 2011 version. I rip it also in "OBJ" format but when I'm importing it in... The map is Sliding because I Can't change the objects Aspect Ratio. Any Ideas?
