- Post Title: Fallout New Vegas - GECK Tool - Problems

Hi folks,

I've been working on a translate of the FNV to Brazilian Portuguese since the game was released.
Now, before more than a year of work, in beta tests, I need do import all the texts translated to a mod, but the Body Part Data causes to GECK crash (standart windows seven crash message).

It's only happen to body part text. Even if I export the original game text and try to import the same original text the crashes occurres.

I've tested this in the first version of both game and GECK and in the latest version of them either.

I'm working with a AMD X3 and 4 Gb of DDR3 and Windows 7...

Someone knows why it's happening or how can I resolve this?

Thanks !
