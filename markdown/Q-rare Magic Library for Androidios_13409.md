- Post Title: Q-rare Magic Library for Android/ios

Looking for some unknown unity mobile games,i found out this free RPG korean game called Q-rare Magic library. The game has a quite good models for a mobile game which is based in a 2dcard game system. 
The 3d chara models and textures files are inside some xxx.qu archieves and hexing it appears they are similar to webgl .unity3d files (maybe some custom ones?):



They remember the .unity3d container so i tried every tool or script i know to open those archieves without success.

Anyone has some ideas about how extract/convert these models?

These are some samples:

Note: inside the apk installer there are no models, u need to install the game to find the game content.
