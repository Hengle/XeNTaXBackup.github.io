- Post Title: Will pay $$ for model rip

Hello everyone!  SO I have been struggling for almost a yer to rip a model from either the xbox 360 or ps3 versions of either NHL 12 or NHL 13, with no luck.  I've read a ton of stuff on these forums, on Facepunch and tried many programs, converters and methods, continually running into walls.

So, it has come to this.  I am requesting that someone rip a specific player with textures for me from the game.  I do not have alot of spare cash to offer, but I'll see exactly what I can scrounge up.  If anybody is willing tot ake this on, pleaseshoot me a PM for more details!  

Thank you very much!
