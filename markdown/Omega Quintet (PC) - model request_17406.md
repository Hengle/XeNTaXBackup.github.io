Easy -- download [Aluigi's "Coyote Console" QuickBMS script](http://aluigi.altervista.org/bms/coyote_console.bms) and run that on the archive, then for any CL3 archives you find, run [this endian-swapped version of Ekey's Mugen Souls script](https://mega.nz/#!X4Jj2STR!9_csZJy2ETUg_uDaKYBKjW94KuEQTSUHoVj_tAEzpkQ) on it.

And yes, that archive does have models in it (in the "3D" folder in ISM2 format, which [my MaxScript can import](https://mega.nz/#!v44XyRgJ!1ucHqBMJHoMg5vES8MgL1Vo0PdAJrRPz0jF29YNqgdo)), and the textures are DDS with a TID extension (rename 'em and they'll work just fine).

Great.

Though it is hard to say, is it possible to export animations ?
