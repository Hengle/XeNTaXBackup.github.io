as you just wanted the audio, i decided to try something a little different with my bms script contribution.

firstly,
i only found references to OGG and WAV files, so my scripts just look for these file signatures

filenames (and file data) is stored in 4-byte blocks - which this format enforces with padding. due to this, i was able to work backwards to extract the filenames correctly 

also,
as the game was made with unity, this script may even work on other .assets files (untested, bold claim)


finally, it seems the background music (only 3 tracks..) are very tiny loops - 14/20/22 seconds worth, and all under 230 KB.

feel free to point out any syntax errors

Hello there! My name is Jacob, pleasure to meet you all.  Listen. I'm new to this "BMS" thing. Could you elaborate as to how to use "BMS"? Much would be appreciated.
