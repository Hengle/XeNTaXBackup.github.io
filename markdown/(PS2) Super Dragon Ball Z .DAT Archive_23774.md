- Post Title: (PS2) Super Dragon Ball Z .DAT Archive

Hello everyone! I have been trying to mod this old PS2 game, however, I have been unable to figure out how to extract the game's contents. Here are some example files that might be needed if someone wants to take a crack at it. There are 3 example files in total, but I'm quite certain that the main files are stored in GAME.DAT.

Since they never answered and this clearly isn't solved, I've removed that from the topic title.
