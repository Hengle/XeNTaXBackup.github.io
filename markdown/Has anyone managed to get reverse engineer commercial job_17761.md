It's like an dedicated game hacker in commercial world. Has anyone managed to find a job or paid position that is about reverse engineering, software hacking?

I guess it depends on your job and country.
There are people payed to find security holes in various software afterall.

As for specifically game hacking, its probably more something you'd do 'underground' as it were, or in China, as companies wouldn't much want to be associated with it and risk the accusations of theft.
