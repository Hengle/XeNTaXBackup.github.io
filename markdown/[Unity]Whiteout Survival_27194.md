- Post Title: [Unity]Whiteout Survival

It's a Unity game (2018.4.36f1), but it seems to encrypt the AssetBundle.
I did some research but couldn't find which locations were encrypted.
Also, they have hidden the API from il2cpp, so it's impossible to find out more from the code side.
Anyone interested in it?
