- Post Title: Unity TextMesh Tool

Hello, regarding this topic [viewtopic.php?f=35&t=17957](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=35&t=17957)
I have written a tool for extracting text from multiple TextMesh files. Designed to work with "That Dragon, Cancer" game, but it should also support other Unity games as well.


Instruction: 
1. Install Python 2.7 [https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-2714/](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-2714/)
2. Extract TextMesh files using UnityEx
3. Change paths at the end of my script
4. Run script
5. Output strings will be in defined INI file

Unfortunately reimport is not supported.
