I do not know if this is the right forum for this, but can someone post Chukklez's blazin moves animations?

I have always fancied these animations and would like them for future use.

Any Help?

I have tried making a cue file for this with no luck. I tried to burn it, but it was an unsupported format. Any Help?

The file you linked is locked behind a password. Also if you're still interested the data.bin has been dumped via noesis on the japan port of the game.
