- Post Title: Smackdown 2011 pofo files

I'm trying to inject files into the edit mdoe of the game. I have been able to find the models but can't seem to find any readable textures. 

There are pofo files in the archive and I am wondering if these are perhaps the textures in some custo format. Can please take a look and let me know.
