- Post Title: NHL 09 PC model

Hey! Would anyone be able to help me? I've been trying to get a hockey player model from NHL 09 on PC for awhile but nothing seems to work for me. Every time I try it crashes! I've used Ninjaripper and 3d via print screen. If you could please rip me a player with stick from the game I would be eternally grateful! I have custom textures of my favorite player that I've wanted a model of for a while! I can send the ISO file. I am also willing to offer $10 for anyone who can successfully get me a complete model.
