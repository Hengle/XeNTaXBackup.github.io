If anyone has 3DS Max 9 and can test the plugins for that, I'd appreciate it. Also, if you guys want plugins for 2008, 2009, 2012, or 2013, just upload the SDK from any of these and send me the link.

Not any time soon.  The import plugin was bad enough, but one day, I may get the inspiration to do an exporter.

I am so glad I posted the plugin here though.  It's quite entertaining to hear stories of people that can't seem to download or get the plugin, that I'd rather they couldn't get the plugin anyway.

Thank you for the reply. I did try to change the format to .PNG as you said, but still I can not be able the read/open the texture files. Thank
This is the texture file calls "all.tex" that I extracted from 001.pac file using the UFC2010_PAC.bms from brienj: [http://www.mediafire.com/?6rxk7o9rhxw67hm](http://www.mediafire.com/?6rxk7o9rhxw67hm)
And this is the broken .dds files that I use the UFC2010_TEX.bms from brienj to extracted: [http://www.mediafire.com/?nof4wsmhziqilq2](http://www.mediafire.com/?nof4wsmhziqilq2)
Can you/anyone please take a look at this file for me?

Thank you

If you need the Max 2012 SDK to compile a 2012 version I can send it to you if you still need it. I use 2012 exclusively so I'm unable to use the script as it is currently.

What would you need to make a plugin for 3DS Max 2013? I guess I dont know what the SDK is, but if someone can help me out with that, I'll do my best to provide it

Any way to use this for 3DS max 2014? Because I don't find links to download 3ds max 11/10/9 versions. They aren't anymore on Autodesk website.

Hey brienj. Thanks for the plugin. But for some reason all weights are red. There's no blend values between the weighted vertices. It doesn't seem ok. Any thoughts on this?
