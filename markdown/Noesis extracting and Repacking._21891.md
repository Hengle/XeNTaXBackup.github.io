- Post Title: Noesis extracting and Repacking.

So I am working on a game that I used to upload and play all the time. The game is called dragon ball raging blast 2. I recently got a new laptop to start doing this again. While using noesis, I can extract character models into .spr, .vram, and .ioram files. My problem is trying to repack them into the afs file i extracted them from. i will leave a link to the video showing the files in Noesis. The version i am using 4405.
