Most models in this game use the same file for creating skeleton.
i found they are:biped.bsk,civilian_biped.bsk,parachute.bsk .
Which file  is at the end of .cdoll file (edit in hexeditor) .
Importer don't read .cdoll files.
For reading another .bsk file please correct manual line 323.

Mayby this help you for weigting data:
For rigged model you must parenting meshes to armature :
 - select meshes - in 3d window menu -Select =>Select all by type =>mesh
 - select armature - shift + right button mouse
 - parenting - ctrl+p =>make parent to =>armature = >create vertex groups ? =>don't create groups 
 - select armature
 - go to pose editor - ctrl + tab - select bone RMB => g - for translate, r - for rotate , rr - for local rotate ,s - for scale bone.

For checking if model have vertex groups:
 - select mesh
 - in 3d window - go to weight paint mode - ctrl+tab
 - go to buttons window => editing(F9) = >link and materials => vertex groups =>browses available vertex groups
 - if no one please send me your imported model

I'm a bit confuse, When you open up the blend file, what do you do after when it's open, like, how do you use that script to respond to begin with, once it open onto blender?

Talk about throwing out the baby with the bathwater.  This is a perfect example of a legal file which was needlessly removed from this forum.

Anyone have a working download link for this Just Cause 2 importer for Blender?
