- Post Title: p3d,col RD2,3

Hi, I need help with _trk.p3d files in RD2 game, wanna convert them into RD3
I found the p3d to z3d tool(beta04) and it doesn't fully support RD2 Track p3d files.
I'll' attach all files from A1Ring track on MediaFire, because it's too big to upload there.

And the p3d to z3d tool [https://www.mediafire.com/file/hsrzh06r ... d.zip/file](https://www.mediafire.com/file/hsrzh06r7md44wb/p3d2z3d.zip/file)

The most important for me is _trk.p3d file, but some others can't be converted too, you can check yourself, will cause 1kb zmodeler project file or few kb's just few things will appear

So can someone find a solution to convert this _trk file into zmodeler project?

Also you can see col.col file which is the whole collision track mesh, they exist in RD1 RD2 and RD3 games, putting one from a track to RD3 cause the car to fly through the track textures into the space, sometimes not.

So i would need the _trk converted to rd3, and maybe editing the .col mesh.

I give you the format which is used for RD3 Car Models P3D, (in RD3 tracks are .PX, renaming some to P3D works) so it's similar, may help you.
