Gameloft the company behind most of those mobile games such as Modern Combat & Asphalt uses a format which stores almost every bit of data inside it, from sound, flash data to animation and model data.

I created a tool which will search through the .sobfs files and retrieve all the sound data and export them as .wav

Sample content is included in the archive but some games that utilize this file format include

Modern Combat Sandstorm
Modern combat Black Pegasus
Modern combat 3
Modern combat 4




Tool here

I'm working on the other formats

Hi,

I don't know if you have this tool 8 years later, can you send me the tool to download? I am actually trying to extract the audio from MC4.

Thanks in advance if you still look at this stuff.
