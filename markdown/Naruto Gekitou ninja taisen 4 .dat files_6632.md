I tried contacting him but he doesn't reply, and I'm sure it's from the gamecube since I noticed sakura's long hair in the video which is not present in the naruto games for the wii but is in naruto gekitou ninja taisen 4 alternate look.

the gamecube is probably using the same format as the old mario games bmd or whatever it is just look for a converter.

The file you posted is still compressed. were they like that in the game or where they in an fpk file.
you need to post the fpk file not compressed file sections.

this is the correct extractor
no idea about the model format its not worth my time looking at for 1 or 2 slightly different models that are not in the other games.
just rip them from the emulator and pose them to a t-pose if you want them.

```
comtype prs_8ing
get idstring long
get files long
get unkown long
get totalsize long
for i = 1 to files
getdstring name 0x14
get offset long
get zsize long
get size long
clog name offset zsize size
next i

```

Thanks sir chrrox , I'll just try to look for a converter or a viewer for the extracted dat files.
