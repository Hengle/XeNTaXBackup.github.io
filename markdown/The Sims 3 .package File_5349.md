- Post Title: The Sims 3 .package File

Since the FullBuild1.package file is where the music is stored for the PC version, I'm assuming it's again stored in this file for the Xbox 360 version.

However I can't seem to locate the music within the file.

Here's the first 10MB

[http://www.flameupload.com/files/QVMXCK ... d1.package](http://www.flameupload.com/files/QVMXCK3O/FullBuild1.package)

EDIT: I have tried opening the package file with the same tool I use to open the package files for the PC version but to no avail.

Can a moderator please move the topic to the relevent part of the forum please.

Also, feel free to help me.
