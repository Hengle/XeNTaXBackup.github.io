- Post Title: Dead Rising 2: Case Zero .tex files

I want to get the textures for Chuck's orange shirt, but they seem to be written in a different format than DR2 on PC.

When DR2 PC's .tex files are unpacked using one of aluigi's scripts, it spits out .dds files with the textures.

However even after using the Case Zero script on his site, the textures are not spit out as .dds by his "DR2TextureConvert" texture, and cannot be read by any program.

Does anyone have any tips or suggestions? Help would be extremely appreciated.

Attached is a Case Zero texture file that seems to have no compression but still can't be read.

Thanks to anybody who reads this.

They look like Xbox textures, if they are, they're swizzled.

No, as I said it does not produce a .dds file and we are trying to solve that.

The textures are swizzled but I have no idea how to undo that. We have tried many scripts for it but they don't seem to have an effect.
