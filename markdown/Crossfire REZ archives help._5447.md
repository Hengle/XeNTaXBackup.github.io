- Post Title: Crossfire "REZ" archives help.

Ok.. .I was wondering does anyone tried to decompress [crossfire](http://crossfire.z8games.com/) game archives? 

It would be really nice to have some sort of tools for unpacking those files, also the models from taht game looks really nice. 

I'm uploading two semples for 'rez' files and the exes and dlls from the main directory of the game.
