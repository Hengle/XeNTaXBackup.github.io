- Post Title: Dragon Ball Z Budokai Tenkaichi 3 - PMDL (?) format

Hi. I'm looking for help in decoding BT3's model and bone format. I would like fighter/character models fully extracted with UVs, bones, rigs and textures.

They are packed in an unknown container file, that contains the PMDL string in it. Another researcher told me he strongly believes this is the format. I even tried looking to the BT3 modding community, which makes alternate skins, but no luck on actual extraction. I would greatly appreciate being pointed in the right direction!

Thanks
