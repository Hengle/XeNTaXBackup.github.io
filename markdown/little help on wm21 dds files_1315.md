First get the new DDS Plugin:

[http://rapidshare.de/files/2300061/dds.8bi.html](http://rapidshare.de/files/2300061/dds.8bi.html)

Then:

Save all Bump Maps as DXT3 without MipMaps.
Save all non Bump Maps as DXT1 no Alpha with 4 MipMaps.

You have to select "Generate MipMaps" in the save Dialog  and change "All" to "4".
