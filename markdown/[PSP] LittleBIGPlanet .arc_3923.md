- Post Title: [PSP] LittleBIGPlanet *.arc

Hi guys! I have another request. It's the archive format from LittleBIGPlanet for the PSP. 
This one could be tricky becaue it's compressed. No extraction program supports this.    Here's the little one of the two containers from the game: [http://www.sendspace.com/file/1l0tkr](http://www.sendspace.com/file/1l0tkr) (4.5 MB)
I hope someone can figure out the compression and write a BMS script.  

THANKS A LOT!
