- Post Title: so how does one make a mesh extractor anyway?

this might have been covered in another topic but I was not able to find it (simply because I didn't really know how to go about searching that).

so a good number of people here can make tools to extract mesh, textures, etc. This is something I would like to do myself, I have a fair knowledge of visual basic and how to use hex editors. the problem is I don't really know how said programs work or what they look like on the inside. so I was wondering if someone could tell me, or tell me about one that I can see the insides of. also the games I would be interested in are for the most part on the ps2, which I imagine would have some effect on this. thanks for your time and help
