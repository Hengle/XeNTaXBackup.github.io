- Post Title: Kingdom Hearts 2.8 A fragmentary passage sound files

I could use some help getting the sound files for this game in a proper fashion to ensure they come out as playable .scd files. Umodel does not export them and the closest thing I can get to with the UE4 QuickBMS script is this .uasset file

So could you please help me? I am really interested in these.
