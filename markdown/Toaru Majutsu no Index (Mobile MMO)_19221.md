Does anyone know if the models in this game can be ripped? It appears to be from a china app company.

The game wiki page
[https://toarumajutsunoindex.wikia.com/w ... obile_MMO)](https://toarumajutsunoindex.wikia.com/wiki/Toaru_Majutsu_no_Index_%28Mobile_MMO%29)

The company website where there is a link to download the game as well.

I understand that to request help, I have to provide sample files, but I have no idea where to get them on a mobile game. Would appreciate any assistance in this matter.

Managed to find the game files, and have uploaded what I think are the actual files in question. But have no idea how to deal with it. Please assist if you know.

Am successful in converting the model, but cannot locate texture. 

@ akderebur
The tool you link allows me to view the model and convert them to obj, but not the textures. It mentions another script in the link that is supposed to convert the textures to something called ktx, but after using it, the recommended conversion program "Mali Texture Compression Tool" fail to open the texture.

Hi. I tried the tool recommended. Every sample I tried fail. 

Maybe the format isn't ktx? I am following the instructions on the link provided above, so I don't actually know what the real format of the texture is.
