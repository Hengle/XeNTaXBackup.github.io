While I like what the tool does, and giving me good HD textures compared to the private tool that I helped with, the only downside I don't like about this is that for max versions under 2017 have broken rigging, and would like it if other max versions under 2017 are supported, ofc I am willing to test if for ya if needed, just message me and i'll give ya my contact info.

left - your max script
right - private tool

A few days ago I've been told that some secret tool is made for this game, and people using this tool are exploiting that fact to sell models they're getting with the secret tool.

So I started making a public universal tool for it. Today I found that some version of the tool was published, but I decided to finish my tool anyway, because I already spent 3 days on it, and it may be still useful for people who dont have max. So here it is:

[viewtopic.php?f=16&t=18087](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=18087)

This tool does not require any additional software, it will work for noesis, blender, max or maya, because its a standalone tool that exports into Xnalara ASCII format and you can load it with plugins from any editor.

Textures will also be exported with the same tool, no need for external converters. I had to spend about a day to research the swizzle type, and now its working:



then yesterday evening added geometry, UVs and such



and this evening added skeleton, weights and base morph for faces

Well actually this "secret tool" was not mine (as you can tell from demonslayers post), the tool you are talking about was made by Ploaj (by informations given me, this tool is still held in private). However I DO NOT accuse Ploaj of being willing source for what you are saying, he have his good reasons to keep his tool private (hopefully), and only ones responsible for "selling models" are those who are actually selling them, not tool creator himself!!

I also respect your advertisment of your tool here, however I would never even think about this move, just tellin people "hey I made tool too" in others post, however that's just my "opinion".

Anyways, tool made a great improvements. It's on Beta 1.4, and I didn't even bothered making posts here, don't want to spam.

I was NOT accusing anyone, and I never said the tool creator was selling anything. But I had to post about it here and it seems it was good idea, because now we finally have more information about this all.

p.s. it was not clear from demonslayers post, who made the secret tool

On a different subject...
I was ripping models from Xenoblade 2 one day and found this in the playable characters folder...

[https://drive.google.com/open?id=1F0Gbs ... wu-cVq8U5b](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1F0Gbsn6C3kPeocOQ7KGUI1wu-cVq8U5b)

Has anyone got any idea what it is, or why some of the seven deadly sins would be on top of it???

That's a player test model that was most likely used for testing or debugging purposes.

Only addded BC2 texture support for XC2.can you name the original XCX/XC2 texture extension? I'm aware that your tool convert them into gtx or bntx, but what the original?
also is there any other extensions your importer supports?

thank you for your work!

XC2 uses uses LBIM texture, or witex (switch texture) if you like. It will be converted to bntx.
XCX uses MTXT texture, or catex (cafe texture, since codename for WiiU was/is Cafe), this texture is basically GTX2 texture, with different header.
Switch and WiiU textures are using different swizzling methods.

My tool does not support standalone texture conversion. However on my first post is a link to format topic, where is a link to MTXT topic, where is plugin written by Ace for Noesis. As far for witex, there is tool called XC2-research on GitHub, there is standalone texture converter and maybye more.

I used your tool and must say: It works perfectly, but also realized, what an incredible amount of models, the game includes.   

Is there a file table out there, to help locate the main cast of the game?

What i found out, so far:

[Xenoblade Chronicles X]
chr_dl.cpk - some skells
chr_en.cpk - Enemies
chr_fc.cpk - Faces/Hairs
chr_mb.cpk - Complete Characters/Low poly Background Characters maybe
chr_np.cpk - Non Player - Found Vandham here
chr_pc.cpk - Player Gears/Bodys

Don't get distracted by amount of models this game have. It uses a lot of duplicates.

Also here is some more insight.
[Xenoblade Chronicles X]
chr_dl.cpk - all non-enemy skells
chr_en.cpk - Enemies
chr_fc.cpk - Faces/Hairs
chr_mb.cpk - Cutscene non-party characters
chr_np.cpk - Characters, ussually found wandering in NLA.
chr_pc.cpk - Party bodywear, this should include bodywear for all party members, including their stock.
