you can get the client here,

additional info: apparently, spirit tales uses gamebryo as i've seen *.nif/dds files while the game launcher is updating.


thanks in advanced guys!

that pkg is just a sequence of zlib compressed files so a classical job for offzip -a

there is no index table at the beginning or the end of the archive so it's in a different file, but offzip is enough and doesn't require additional effort
