Would appreciate help with this , i'm trying to create an undubed version of the game by swapping the audio files with the Japanese version once i get my English copy this morning , the second samples that i posted is very small(28mb) unlike the first one , it should be easy for an experienced person especially since it's similar to FFX13-1 file . Any tips ? any easy methods for replacing the files? ideas?
