Hello everyone!!


I'm looking to extract the chibi models from the bleach brave soul game that is available for android.

I've tried all the tools known to me, but so far I have not figured out how to get your textures and 3d models.

I work with papercraft and it is crucial to have these models to create paper dolls.

I await contact from anyone who has a tutorial that can indicate me or better who already has these models extracted to share

I have been researching for almost a year now and have not found a way to extract, I am really desperate for these models, please any help is at least a correct direction where I should start my search again.

Thank you and sorry for anything!
