- Post Title: VITA: Frozen Synapse Prime

While I actually never played the original Frozen Synapse, I do believe I missed out totally there. I'm thinking of getting the title for my PS Vita as it does seem like a perfect fit for the Vita. Problem is, stuff is really being released for that hand-held, and I also eyed Dangaronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc as a very interesting title (I'm into all things Phoenix Wright as well for instance), and also Don't Starve seems like a perfect game to own. 

Know of any of these titles? Which would you pick?
