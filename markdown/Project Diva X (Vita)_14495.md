This plugin seems really promising.

Do you know of any plugins that I can export/view .SPR files, .MOT Files, .VAG files, and .A3DA Files that the game uses?

Put this script in the python folder of noesis.
use noesis to view the models.

Hey Chrrox, can you check a blender script to import Dreamy Theater models??, it's not the script for blender 2.6 posted some years ago, it's a script made by Skaezedrek and it's the most close thing to get fully rigged models but for some reason it doesn't load all models.
