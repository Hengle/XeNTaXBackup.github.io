- Post Title: .sbp Metal Gear Solid V Ground Zeroes (PS3)

Hello again

I datamined the PS3 version of MGS5 Ground Zeroes in order mostly to get my hands on all the audio, but ran into a snag.
First of all, the game data is packed in .psarc so I just used the PSARC Unpacker.
Then the audio used in game-proper is in .sbp format, while audio tapes are in .wem
I managed to easily turn .wem ones into .ogg thanks to ww2ogg and revorb tools.
But the .sbp ones don't seem like any format I know or any that's supported.
A glance at the .sbp files in HEX reveals their header to contain "SBPB   bnk       ƒÞstp   „  ãEBKHD      Xü4 ó          ý        DIDX   ‡z       e[DATA  e[RIFX  eSWAVEfmt" which looks like it could be some form of .bnk container probably with .wem files inside.

Anyone willing to take a look at it and try to make an extractor?
Here's samples:

It would be nice also if someone manages to extract the texts too.

its essentially a ww2 ogg bnk file (or files grouped together) split it from the start of BKHD to the next bkhd/the end of the file if none there. it's a standard BNK which you can use any of the bnk scripts on.

That is weird because I tried various and none of them worked, but I will try removing the unessential header and footer data and see if it works then.

Edit:
Well this doesn't work either, or at least maybe I'm doing something wrong. Did you try and see if any files unpacked?

all you have to delete is the first 32 bytes, aka first two rows in a hex editor. I was wrong about them containing multiple bnk's. Rename as .bnk, open with ravioli, bam. done.

I actually did it before you wrote the post, didn't even need to delete the first 32 bytes, ravioli scanner picked up all the files no problem. Still, thanks for getting me on the right track.
Much appreciated man.
