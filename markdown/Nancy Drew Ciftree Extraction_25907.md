- Post Title: Nancy Drew Ciftree Extraction

Hi. I am looking to extract the Ciftree file for Nancy Drew the Final Scene. I see a while ago there was a program called GOBREAD but it doesn't work on newer computers sadly. Is there a similar program to it that works on newer computers? I do have one of the offical developer tools for the series but it it extracs the image files just fine but the .xs1 files and .dat come out extentionless (but it is obvious what it is supposed to be) and they aren't decrypted. So I just need a tool that can extract and decrypt everything.

I am attaching the Ciftree file that I used to extract stuff, an example .xs1 file, and a example .dat file. S2438 is the dat file and JOH465 is the .xs1 file.

It seems that format is partially known, but nothing can be done without proper reverse engineering.
I've gathered some basic info about the format in this article [http://wiki.xentax.com/index.php/Nancy_Drew_DAT](http://wiki.xentax.com/index.php/Nancy_Drew_DAT)

Btw, what is this "one of the offical developer tools"? Can you share it?
