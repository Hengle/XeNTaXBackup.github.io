Well, that's not nice. 

Sadly I don't have the time/interest to explore it "in depth" but I'll check it using ollydbg,
hex2obj on RAM snapshots or extracted *.arc files.
So I think I'll get these damned level meshes sooner or later. (Last not least I might try Ninja Ripper.)

I've installed the Silent Hill 3 (Trial) for PC.

This is what I've got:

Finally I got it ripped using NinjaRipper - great.
(Seems the walls I was missing are a bunch of small meshes.)

Textures look a little bit spoiled so I used the untextured view.
Next thing will be to get the SH2 (PC) levels - seems there's no demo, maybe I can grab the game from a flea market or so.

(yeah, I know, these games are pretty outdated and I never played them but the levels seem to have some disturbing aura, love it)
