I have modified the Custom Maid 3D 2 .model loader module and I have released the 3D Object Converter v6.540 as a web update now.

How to get the 3D Object Converter v6.540:
Download the 3D Object Converter from [http://3doc.i3dconverter.com](http://3doc.i3dconverter.com) and install it or download and use the portable version.

After it just use the Help/Check for updates... function to get the v6.540.
