- Post Title: S4 League (.lzo)

Hello,
I've found this forum, and I think someone can help me.

So there is a game called S4League, and they have an file called
resource.s4hd. I know that it is encrypted with an 40byte key and AES 256. The Main part is that the game has an folder called "_resources" and it contains all resource files. The resource.s4hd contains a list from every file of the _resources folder and both are encrypted with the same key.
But the Problem is, I dont know how to get the Key.

Can someone give me tips or tricks?
Would be really nice.

If this is the wrong section please move it.
P.S.: It's compressed with LZO [Limpel Zev Oberhumer]
Regards

Skynord.
