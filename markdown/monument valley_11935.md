Hi! I got the apk from Monument Valley, With 7-zip I have extracted the contents. I get several unknown formats like .obb .so ... can someone help me extract the 3d models of the game? I need to understand how these impossible figures are constructed.

They are probably just normal 3d models but with the help of colors it just looks like they do not belong
