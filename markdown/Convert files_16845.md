I don't know how to convert files, but you do have to provide a sample of one of these files so that somebody who does know can analyze it for you.

I don't know if it's possible, but there has to be a way. Let's wait other opinions...

First write all the files to the extension .wav, then run BL2Soundrenamer.exe 1) select the folder with .wav files. 2) Click Convert Wav 2 Ogg & revorb. 3) Click Rneme Oggs.

Wow, it really worked, thanks!
Is there a reason why the files don't have the bitrate like 320kps?
What happens if I convert them in .wav 24bit?

Just tried to convert with Audacity, but the quality gets worse!
