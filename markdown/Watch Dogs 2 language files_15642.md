Hi guys, this tool [viewtopic.php?f=21&t=11599&p=147905#p147905](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=21&t=11599&p=147905#p147905) should unpack Watch Dogs 1 and 2 loc files. Only you have to give first and last ids.
For Watch Dogs 2 try following:

```
wd_loc.exe main_english.loc main_english.txt 4555 20000520
```
