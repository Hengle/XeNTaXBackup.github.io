- Post Title: Daxter - PSP - Font problem

Hello everyone,

I recently decided to translate this game, and while I was able to figure most of the inner workings of the game,
the fonts are still a big challenge to me.

Can anyone help me out?

I'll leave the file attached (and also here [https://mega.nz/#!5F0UVRxS!gdDG419O_lO4 ... xMqQGGoI4I](https://mega.nz/#!5F0UVRxS!gdDG419O_lO4tulC2Tzerpw5eypI1F-9axMqQGGoI4I)).
All I know about it is that it is a 16bpp, but I simply can't find a way to make it look crisp enough to be editable.

This is what I got so far:

Thank you.
