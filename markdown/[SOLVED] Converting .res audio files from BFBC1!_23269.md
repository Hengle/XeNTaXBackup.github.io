- Post Title: [SOLVED] Converting .res audio files from BFBC1!

Hello, i was trying to convert all the voicelines from Battlefield Bad Company (the first one) but i need to find a way to convert the .res files into a more common audio format, i've already tried to use ealayer but i doesn't work at all!
I'm gonna leave here some samples of the aforementioned files -> [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lrYcw9 ... sp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lrYcw9J1ElQwpM5V6B0tfa8Iqgnb9bYW/view?usp=sharing)
I would really appreciate if someone could help me!

You will find all the tools you need here : [http://www.bfeditor.org/forums/index.ph ... rom-bfbc2/](http://www.bfeditor.org/forums/index.php?/topic/14539-extracting-sound-and-music-files-from-bfbc2/)
It's the same procedure as with bfbc2. No ealayer file required, i'm curious how you did it. 

waveDataSns files = 0x00 offset, all are mono audio files if i remember well.

(I extracted bfbc1 audio files and uploaded them some weeks ago... if you don't want to mess around with the tools :
