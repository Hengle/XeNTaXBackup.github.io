- Post Title: Assassins Creed ACBF/ACGA/Rogue .data PS3

This is kind of a long shot I know, but does anyone know how to extract content from the .data files within the .forge files for the ps3 version of the game? if its even feasible.
I've got some prototype builds of the game that I'd love to check out in more detail, but I'd need to get access to the .data file contents.
I've attached a data file in a 7z archive because xentax didn't like the .data extension as an example.

Have you tried [Delutto's forge/data tools? ](https://zenhax.com/viewtopic.php?f=9&t=9138)
