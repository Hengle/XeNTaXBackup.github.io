- Post Title: Streets of Rage 4 (Windows) - .XNB image format

Thanks to [JayK who made an extractor](https://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=21&t=22098), it is possible to extract the images from the game.
But Streets of Rage 4 makes use of, I think, a custom version of .XNB image format? I haven't been able to convert them with the current available converters. GXView from the GameTools Suite can open them but it displays them incorrectly. 

The background textures and sprites animations are very well done in this game, so it would be amazing to be able to display them.

Here is a .zip file with some samples of those .XNB files (a couple of them are from the 'shaders' folder):

Thank you!

yeh. this looks like plain rgb and rgba. the bigger textures have some kinda random bits and offsets in there tho.

i can't pin it, so... i won't try to script it. maybe somebody else...
