- Post Title: Metal Gear Solid: Ground Zeroes PS3 Loc files

I would really like to extract the texts (and if possible to translate the game), but I've no luck with extracting the files. 
The whole game is stored in a PSARC archive which can be extracted with PSARC.exe. 
Some of the text files I guess are here (for obvious reasons):

PS3_GAME\PSARC(extracted)\data\as\tpp\pack\ui\subtitles\EngVoice\EngText

The folder contains 14 files:



Here are two of them, if anyone is willing to take a look:

[http://rghost.net/53018213](http://rghost.net/53018213) - e20010_subtitles.fpk (227 KB)
[http://rghost.net/53018225](http://rghost.net/53018225) - e20010_subtitles.fpkd (1.35 KB)

The archive itself (data.psarc) is 1.35Gb and is stored in PS3_GAME\USRDIR. Extracted however is 2.7Gb.
