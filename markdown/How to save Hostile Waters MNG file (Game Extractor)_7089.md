- Post Title: How to save Hostile Waters MNG file? (Game Extractor)

It's listed in the supported games as "Some archives are writable", in the app as "Reading, Saving, Renaming, Replacing", and in [THIS](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?p=8331#p8331) thread it's mentioned "The full version, however, does do the repacking properly."

But I just can't get it to work, resulting file is just a bunch of NULL.

I have full version, 2.0 (development stopped? that is at least a couple years old).

Example that horribly fails:
*File > New Archive
*Manipulate > Add Files
*Select some file > Add the files to the archive
*The selected files were added to the archive. > OK
*File > Save Archive... > Save Archive
*Change format to "Hostile Waters (MNG_ZGWH)"
*Press either of the "Save the archive" - buttons

Resulting file is 32 NULL

 

How is this supposed to work?
