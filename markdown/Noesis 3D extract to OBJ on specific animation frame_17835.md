- Post Title: Noesis 3D extract to OBJ on specific animation frame

Hello guys,

As the title says. Is there a way to extract the model in preview at the current selected animation frame? Say, extract it to OBJ, but instead of getting an extracted A/T/Y pose character. I get a OBJ with the specific animation frame.

Thank you.

Thank you.

Why not export as an obj with animation, and then just find the frame?

What you say isn't technically possible because you can't select 'specific frames' to be exported, I'm not sure if you can even export frame ranges.

I did realize I could do that but I didn't want to use another 3D software. I was hoping I could do the whole workflow on Noesis.
