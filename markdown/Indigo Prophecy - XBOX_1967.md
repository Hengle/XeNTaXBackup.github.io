- Post Title: Indigo Prophecy - XBOX

Fairly recently I played Indigo Prophecy, Fahrenheit's US counterpart for the XBOX, and I liked the music so much that I searched the internet and downloaded some ripped tracks, unfortunately of very low quality. Basically, I'd like access to the innards of the Indigo Prophecy "BigFile_XBOX" files to see what I can find, hopefully music files of an obvious format. The files I have uploaded are (mostly) two MB Watto cutter zip archive format, though if need be I can certainly upload some seperate ones in MrMouse's cutter format. 

BigFile_XBOX.dat:
[http://www.mytempdir.com/776137](http://www.mytempdir.com/776137)

BigFile_XBOX.d01:
[http://www.mytempdir.com/776151](http://www.mytempdir.com/776151)

BigFile_XBOX.d02:
[http://www.mytempdir.com/776156](http://www.mytempdir.com/776156)

BigFile_XBOX.d03:
[http://www.mytempdir.com/776159](http://www.mytempdir.com/776159)

Also, I've uploaded the similarly named .idm and .idx files that were also in the directory, because I thought that possibly these files contained some more information about the BigFile_XBOX files, though I have not clipped them, a.) because they're so small, b.) because they're so small, clipping them may clip out something important. I hope thats ok.

BigFile_XBOX.IDM:
[http://www.mytempdir.com/776160](http://www.mytempdir.com/776160)

BigFile_XBOX.IDX:
[http://www.mytempdir.com/776161](http://www.mytempdir.com/776161)

Hope I've provided more than enough information to crack the .dat file right open. Surely it is similar in format to the already supported PS2 PAL  version, Fahrenheit? Thanks.

Sorry for the late response, but other chores are taking up all of my time.

See [http://www.xentax.com/?p=90](http://www.xentax.com/?p=90)

But when I'm done with that, I will go through the requests and check if I can help out.

Progress?

If I need to reupload the files to a different upload server, by all means tell me, mytempdir has probably killed them off by now.
