- Post Title: BREACH "DAR" file format

There are files in a new game called BREACH which are compressed into a "DAR" format

i.e.

recon_level.dar
FirstPerson.dar

etc

The format itself isn't much, it doesn't seem encrypted or really "compressed" in any way other than it is a bunch of files stuck together in an archive.

They usually have a corresponding ".pre" file, i.e.

recon_level.pre
FirstPerson.pre

I ask because the compiled LUA files are in these archives, is this a known format?
