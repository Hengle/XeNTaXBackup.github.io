- Post Title: does anyone know how to extract data from a .main file ?

while stumbling across different forums my site fell on retailsamsung.com it contains demo retail content for their smartphones, tablets and wearables.
the retail mode on a phone which generally is a demo video looping on a store demo piece, some images in the gallery and maybe some other multimedia files. for applying retail mode on a samsung phone one has to download the apk listed under the particular phones folder accompanied with a .main file which is named retailcontent_phone model name.main , this .main file is the heaviest and varies from 1GB to 4GB depending on the model of phone selected. i wish to extract the multimedia files from this .main file. have tried opening with 7zip but it isn't an archive.
attaching a link which contains files for Samsung Galaxy A73
