- Post Title: problem with kingdom hearts (1)'s maps

hi to everyone!
I know that my post can be considerate stupid but I'm not very good to do this, so I need help.
I extracted 3d models from kingdom hearts 1 and there are just '.mdls' and '.mset' files.
now, I use an application called 'NOESIS' for opening '.mdls' files but them are characters; so I think that '.mset' files are the maps but NOESIS can't open them...
searching on the forum I founded a thread called 'kh2 maps' or something like this. In the topic there is a folder called 'expack1e' that can open kh 2 (final mix?) maps. I tryed to drag and drop my '.mset' files in it but doesn't work.

Please can someone help me on how to extract/open maps from kh1?
sorry for my bad english and thanks in advance.

P.S.= I already tested a tool, 'ModelViewerWXD3D9', but it crash when I try to open it. Maybe because I have windows 7(?).

Maybe no one wrote scripts to support the maps, seeing how most people care about models.

so, isn't there any way to do it?
in the last message I talked about a topic 'kh2 maps' ,I think, and I saw in it images with maps from kh1 like the word of Hercules (I don't remember the name  ) and the starting word...

Before Open a topic "read the instructions inside the forum XD", I'm not hangry, take it easy XD

However, the Mset files is the animations files of the MDLS if you do a little search I've opened a post titled "MSET RESEARCH PROJECT" =D.

Mmmm, i THINK the KH map files are inside the ard files, but I could be wrong. 

I'd really love to have a KH map extractor, that would make my day. lol
