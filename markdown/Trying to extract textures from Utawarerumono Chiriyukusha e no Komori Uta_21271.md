- Post Title: Trying to extract textures from Utawarerumono: Chiriyukusha e no Komori Uta

As the title mentions, I'm trying to extract textures from this game.  I've got the individual .tex files but am having trouble converting them to PNGs (or any other standard image format).

I've found the Sting/Aquaplus converter in this thread: [viewtopic.php?f=18&t=19496&p=148642&hilit=sting#p148642](https://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=18&t=19496&p=148642&hilit=sting#p148642)

It almost works, but the decoded image has some obvious issues.  It looks like maybe the channels are wrong or it's not decoding the palette properly, but I've played around with it a little bit and haven't figured anything out yet.  I've attached an example of a raw .tex file, and here's what I'm currently getting from it: [https://imgur.com/a/0IwqZMY](https://imgur.com/a/0IwqZMY) .  Does anybody have any ideas?

Thanks in advance!

It's difficult to keep up with all Sting/Aquaplus TEX variations.

I've updated the [universal script](https://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?p=148642#p148642).
Also, it would be nice if you've posted more samples.
