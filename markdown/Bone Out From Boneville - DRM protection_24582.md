- Post Title: Bone: Out From Boneville - DRM protection

I recently purchased an old Windows XP game in CD form called Bone: Out From Boneville, it was a new-in-box copy still in its plastic wrap, originally sold by its publisher.  For whatever reason, it installs fine and the launcher appears like normal, but actually running the game makes a message pop up claiming that the game disc isn't inserted.  This is very strange considering the disc is inserted and the only way to launch the game is through the disc, so if I double-clicked on the disc's icon, why does it think it's not inserted?

Out of curiousity, I set up a Windows XP virtual machine and installed all the updates for it.  I thought it must be a problem with Windows 10's removal of SafeDisc stuff, but sure enough, even in Windows XP, it always thinks the disc is not inserted.  So, I busted out the old Windows XP computer, fired it up, inserted the disc, installed the game, and like always, it claims the disc is not inserted!

There's no No-CD patches for this game, and there's a 0% chance that it's a fake copy, I've done my research.  It does contain all the game files, I can open them up with special tools to confirm this.  The game is clearly there, it's just not working as it should.  There were never any update files released for it either, so it's not like I'm missing some prerequisite.  PCGamingWiki does claim that it uses something called "SoftwarePassport (Armadillo) DRM".  Could someone more knowledgeable take a look at this game and figure out what the heck is going on here?  I just want to relive childhood memories but this game shipped out in an unplayable state apparently!  It's an old game, so I put it on the Internet Archive, this is the only way to get it nowadays:

Here's a short clip of the issue taken from a VM, but the same thing happens on an actual Windows XP computer:

Update:  I've found a no-cd patch that makes the game boot, however it's for a German version, so it only gets to the logos.  Does anyone know how to make no-cd patches for old games like this?

Update 2:  Just tried running it on Windows 10 with the actual disc inserted, and the game works 100%.  It seems that the game is able to tell a difference between the real disc and an ISO.  Can anyone figure out how it knows this?  I'd rather preserve it and make an ISO.

No-CD patches and cracking DRMs are NOT something that we discuss here. It's reverse engineering forum, so most topics are related to extracting content from game files etc.

All I can tell you is that I have this game on steam, so at some point it was possible to get digital version (probably from humble bundle).

And it's not true that it is not available at all. 
For example you can buy it in this polish shop for 3 PLN [https://bazar.lowcygier.pl/offer/255541](https://bazar.lowcygier.pl/offer/255541)

You can also buy Bone Complete Bundle here for 3,60 PLN [https://bazar.lowcygier.pl/offer/340573](https://bazar.lowcygier.pl/offer/340573)


P.S. Any cracking-related posts in this topic will be deleted from now on.

imo discussing bypassing old DRM that simply doesn't work anymore should be allowed, but only for DRM which doesn't work anymore (usually because of Windows breaking it in some way, be it intentional due to security issues with a driver, or unintentional)
