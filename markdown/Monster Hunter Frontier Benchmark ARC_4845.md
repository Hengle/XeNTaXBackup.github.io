- Post Title: Monster Hunter Frontier Benchmark ARC

Hi,

checked out the MHF Benchmark and found quite interesting files with ARC ending. First I thought I could easily extract it with my 7Zip as I heard that fileformat as archive before. But fail.. meh.
But it seems pretty simple as one can see the paths and names directly. Hope you can help me with it!

Examples: [http://vuze.celes-network.de/tempfiles/ ... rk_arc.zip](http://vuze.celes-network.de/tempfiles/mhfbenchmark_arc.zip)

Kind regards
