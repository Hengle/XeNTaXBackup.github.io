- Post Title: [Request] Digimon 3D models

Hi, here is my first post here  Im a noob about those tech stuff, so I would like to help me 

I want the 3D models from the Digimon Rumble Arena games, one is on PSX and the other on PS2. 
Can someone point me the way to take them from the game CD/DVD, or if someone has them, to upload them somewhere? 

Thanks in advance
