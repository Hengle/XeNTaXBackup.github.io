Could someone please explain how to edit the arc files? I been trying to add character images and nothing is working. 

I would pay $20 to someone who please explains how it is done for arc files, and aditional attires. Thanks!

I've written a tutorial on my site on how to add additional attires. Check it out. You can donate there if you wish also. 

There is also a tutorial on how to add selection pics on caws.ws forums.
