- Post Title: [Help!] about the kh3 map

hello! im new in here,i kind of question of the kh3 tool...here is my question:

1.use kh3.exe in path :\ps4 test\Game\Maps\ra\uasset file.
2.get the material.db,blueprint,staticmesh.raw,skeletalmesh.raw,skeletalmesh and staticmesh,materials,textures file.
3.move them to the path :\ps4 test\Game\Levels\ra and drag the path :\ps4 test\Game\Levels\ra\ra_01.umap
its work but i only get the staticmesh,they are not coordinate, i dont know what im doing wrong...

even see [viewtopic.php?p=162674#p162674] still cant figure out.,i hope can someone tell me what im doing wrong.

its amazing tool but i cant get the coordinate,sorry for the bad english.  

hope everyone keep healthy and warm,have a good day for everyone.
