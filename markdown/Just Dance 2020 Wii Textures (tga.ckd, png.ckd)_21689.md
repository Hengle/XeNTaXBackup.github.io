Hi, everyone!

I have problems with opening Just Dance 2020 Wii textures. I tried to search the web, but didn't find any information about these textures.

[Some samples](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1O_vsMjtsdRvNJArJPsIn9_MCSYNnjwd-?usp=sharing)

P.S. Sorry for my bad english.

3 out of 4 of your samples is corrupt, but this Noesis python script works with avatar.png.ckd

I tried your script, it's works on some textures, but it's doesn't work with textures that more than 30KB.
