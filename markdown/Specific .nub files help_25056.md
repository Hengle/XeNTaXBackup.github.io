- Post Title: Specific *.nub files help

There is very little info I could dig up on the *.nub file type in this context, all that I could figure out is that it contains audio and from what I've seen it is used in Keita Takahashi games for the PS3 (Katamari Tribute/Katamari Forever and Noby Noby Boy). I'm nearly certain that they are the same format in both games. The games share two similarities; both published by Bandai Namco for the PS3, and both being Keita Takahashi games,

From what I can gather, each .nub file has a corresponding .bin file named "nuSound2ToneStr*.bin", * being whatever the name of the .nub was.

In both games I have looked at, the .nub files are located in some form of directory along the lines of *\PS3_GAME\USRDIR\Sound and in Forever there are two additional files in the directory, "config.bin" and "config_3d.bin"

I will attach a clip of a .nub from the US version of Katamari Forever below, as I couldn't attach the additional .bin.

As per we don't have the cake file, because this file nub, is some kind a filelist.
35kb is impossible have some sound on that.

Your nub file, has a lot of vag magic word, is a lot used by sony.
