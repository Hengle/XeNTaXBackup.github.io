- Post Title: Blender devs newer FBX versions research

From Blender developers meeting, January 12, 2014 ([http://lists.blender.org/pipermail/bf-c ... 42664.html](http://lists.blender.org/pipermail/bf-committers/2014-January/042664.html))

> - FBX woes: Autodesk is fading out the FBX version we use, attempts to support the newer versions (7.3/7.4) run into troubles because a lack of public specs. There's some hidden checksum that validates files - or so. Bastien Montagne and Campbell Barton work on it. Help welcome!
