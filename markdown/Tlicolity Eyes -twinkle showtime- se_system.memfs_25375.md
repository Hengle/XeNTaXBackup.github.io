The error says that you need se_system.membody file in the same directory as se_system.memfs file.
Put both files together in one folder and it should fix the issue.

And here's article for reference [http://wiki.xentax.com/index.php/Tlicol ... FS_MEMBODY](http://wiki.xentax.com/index.php/Tlicolity_Eyes_MEMFS_MEMBODY)
