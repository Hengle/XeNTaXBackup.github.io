- Post Title: A story about my uncle [SoundNodeWave extract subtitles]

Hi, im trying to translate this great game, but i get stucked with this motherfucking file. Why would you encrypt the fucking subtitles with the fucking sound without thinking in fan translators? If anyone got an idea on how to separate the files inside of it, please let me now. The only option at the moment is using an Hxeditor, as always... 

If anyone needs some files for testing, let me know... bye.
