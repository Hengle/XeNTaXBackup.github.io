- Post Title: Anarchy Reigns

A Demo of Anarchy Reigns has been released not too long ago. It being a Platinum Games title(makers of Vanquish, Bayonetta), it is already more or less supported by existing tools, unfortunately however, with a few caveats:


(Here, the hair is missing but is the model otherwise fine)


(here, the hair and Jacket id missing (physics objects?) and the body texture is mangled)

All of the models Ive been able to view has at least one of these problems, and none of the currently existing tools Ive used seems to be able to surmount them.

I would humbly ask one of the resident experts to take peek at this. I can provide any of the necessary extracted files and the demo itself is freely available on the Japanese Xbox Live, and has also been uploaded on other severs for download (a link for which I can provide upon request if desired).
