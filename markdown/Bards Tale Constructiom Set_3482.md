- Post Title: Bards Tale Constructiom Set

I am looking for anyone who can help me decode the graphics for this old DOS game, Bards Tale Construction Set.
I have posted a bunch of sample graphic files.
dun0*.* are wall graphics
arch.* and orc.* are monster/character graphics
Don't know what the rest are.

It looks like the .scr files contain animation info.

I've taken a fast look over .pic and .pac files, but couldn't recognise any obvious structure.

Maybe if you could provide a screenshot of that orc.pac in bmp, tga or png someone can tell you more.

At least, I can tell some basic headers in the file (widht, height).

Unfortunatly, the game seems to be failing (when I run it, windows complains about an illegal NTVDM opcode) so I cant get a picture. (anyone with ideas of how to solve this please tell me, windows XP 32bit is the OS)
Thanks for taking a look though.

DOS games don't tend to work well in anything higher than win98, so I'd recommend you to use a dos emulator like this one: [http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/dosb ... e?download](http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/dosbox/DOSBox0.72-win32-installer.exe?download)

It can execute any DOS game pretty well if the configuration is right.

There are many guides over the net about installing this and getting it up and running, but if you have any problem just tell me, I can help.

I hope this will solve any compatibility problem, best luck!

Have you tried running the game in dosbox?
