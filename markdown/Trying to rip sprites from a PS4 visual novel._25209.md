- Post Title: Trying to rip sprites from a PS4 visual novel.

Hello. I've been trying to rip the sprites and cgs of this PS4 Visual Novel called "Exile Election" for a long while now. However, after extracting from the chr.cpk all the files are from 00000 to 01867. The files are unknown, so I have no idea what to do. If you wish to take a look at one of the files you can find it here [https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/ ... 8693/00024](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/852060750939815936/958757008767598693/00024). I would really appreciate some help ;; I'm at a lost here

There are a good 30+ games in this forum alone that're rips and tools for PS4 games.
there are tools in here for Bloodborne, Uncharted, Elden Ring, Horizon Zero Dawn, Death Stranding, all from their PS4 release, and those are just a handful of the big ones.
It's very possible to rip from PS4 games, you either need to dump the game from your jailbroken console, or get a rip from elsewhere.
