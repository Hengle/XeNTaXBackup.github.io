I've been using TiledGGD, TextureFinder and Tilemolester to find graphics in memory dumps from a 2001 videogame. Now, TileMolester would be the perfect program, except for one little problem: I can't adjust the canvas width pixel by pixel. This is extremely annoying because if I find an actual image it will look like this:

If I increase the width by one, it will look like this:

And if I decrease by one, it looks like this:

So there is basically no way for me to actually visualize graphics properly, because width increases per "tile" and not per pixel.

Is there a way to solve this?

PS. I made this exact thread at Zenhax but this might be the right place for it, actually.
