- Post Title: Rockett Games (PC/Mac, Purple Moon, .PRS .PRD)

Purple Moon's Rockett games definitely deserve a chance to be looked into. The files, as mentioned in the title, for the earlier games, are .PRS and .PRD.

This sample comes from Rockett's New School: [https://zenhax.com/download/file.php?id=6560](https://zenhax.com/download/file.php?id=6560)

See if you can crack them.
