- Post Title: (Request) dt_na.dat file extraction from Mario Super Slugger

We are requesting a tool that can extract a big file containing data in the dt_na.dat that I got from the Mario Super Sluggers game on the wii. It has models, textures and many others, but the music files are in brstm and not in this archive. Could you guys make a tool that will extract the big .dat that's 680MB that's almost to 700MB.
