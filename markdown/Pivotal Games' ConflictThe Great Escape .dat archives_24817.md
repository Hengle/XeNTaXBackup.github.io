- Post Title: Pivotal Games' Conflict/The Great Escape .dat archives

Hello, and I'm sorry for spamming, but I'm trying to complain about them (.dat) from the following games:

Conflict: Desert Storm - [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_Qubom ... sp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_QubomkVgLKjAm6AUXwJaIeItiEUnaJj/view?usp=sharing)
Conflict: Desert Storm 2 - [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1H9QOIo ... sp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1H9QOIoSGhnDAWl1VRjB4Grx3sTDZXDNL/view?usp=sharing)
Conflict: Vietnam - [https://drive.google.com/file/d/12_mGDZ ... sp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/12_mGDZHCNWiTunZAezZIeBGqB_veerTb/view?usp=sharing)
Conflict: Global Storm - [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Yh2KCg ... sp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Yh2KCgfa2cc99TiXymeFZO5ad6fpuLx9/view?usp=sharing)
The Great Escape - [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QHOj6v ... sp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QHOj6v2YEe9aExUGSR-WFPhrN2aPstKN/view?usp=sharing)

If QuickBMS and Game Extractor get no filenames, it will be great to reverse engineer and Ekey will create a tool with a dumped file list here.

Thanks for making an alternate tool with a list of filenames for me.
