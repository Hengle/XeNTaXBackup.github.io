- Post Title: Parappa The Rapper 2 .tm0 files.

I'm having trouble, actually EVERYBODY in the PTR2 modding community is having trouble opening tm0 files. These have pretty much been confirmed to be scrambled/compressed tm2 files, as looking in the hex of a tm0 says "tm2' as the header. Most people have theorized these are multiple textures into one, as a tm0 is much larger than Parappa's tm2 hat. This is the result of a tm0 in Rainbow, a program for tm2. 
 
and this is the result in Console Texture Explorer, with the same width and height.  Could someone PLEASE help with this? That would be great!
