- Post Title: How to Download This Flash Game

As we all know, Adobe Flash Player will be shutting down soon and I want to find a way to keep on playing some of my favorite flash games offline. One of the games I want to retain is [FarmCliff](https://www.integrations.partner.spilgames.com/game/farm-cliff). So far, I'm unable to find the SWF file even with the Inspect Element feature of Google Chrome. Some help would be appreciated if possible.
