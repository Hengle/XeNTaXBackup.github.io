Hi. Is there any way to play Hitman (2016) audio file? I think its format is Cri ADX 4-bit ADPCM.
Here is the file: [https://mega.nz/#!AtcmgRJa!CZo5voqUx7XS ... hpvS1KwsSs](https://mega.nz/#!AtcmgRJa!CZo5voqUx7XS0OD9-NaSP4BhhKpi6OX4GhpvS1KwsSs)

You can decode it with vgmstream using the -i switch to ignore loop info. This 6-channel ADX must have a somewhat different format than we're used to, it came [in this other thread](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=17&t=14568) as well.
