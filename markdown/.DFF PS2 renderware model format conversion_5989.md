- Post Title: .DFF PS2 renderware model format conversion

I have a bunch of renderware PS2 .DFF models from a game I have, and I would like to be able to convert them into a format usable in 3ds max, with proper uv mapping and normals. Does anyone any ideas as to how to do this? I have looked at various importers and things for 3ds max, for example:
GTA DFF importer

This tool gave me an error when I tried to import the .dffs, probably because the format/version is slightly different.

Sonic Heroes DFF importer

This one is supposed to work with this particular model version, as I was told on a model request thread, but when I import, it says "import successful" and there is nothing there. 

I know it can be done, I have seen screenshots from chrrox of some of the models I wanted imported into 3ds max, with textures and everything. 

Can someone help me convert this file, or create an importer of some type that actually works?

Mario isn't talking for some reason... Im also in the Inuyasha thread, and he has posted, but won't say how he converted the files. I don't get it...    All the higher ups in Xentax know all this cool stuff, but they don't share their knowledge, and they don't respond to PMs... (SAD FACE)
