I'm trying to get the meshes in Loons: Fight for the Fame on XBOX in hex2obj. Here's a sample:

Still not entirely sure what I'm doing. It's supposed to be Yosemite Sam.

first of all it's required to give the file some structure - otherwise analysing will end up in a waste of life and time
because there's much skeleton data (assumed, matrices?).

Getting proper point clouds is the key to get the mesh finally.

Good luck.

this file is chaotic and looks like an archive of sorts, it has models and textures and maybe animations.
