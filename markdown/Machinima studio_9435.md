With this program you can export mesh textures and animation from this game:

Aion
Allods Online
Fallout 3
Fallout new vegas
Runes of magic
Starcraft II
Warhammer online
World of Warcraft

I EXPLAIN HOT TO USE THIS PROGRAM WITH THE CLIENT OF AION

First off all we need the client of AION [HERE](http://www.aionfreetoplay.com/website/download)
After istalling and upgrade we need MachinimaDev ( this is only the trial) [HERE](http://www.machinimadev.com/download/) and this program [HERE](http://slimdx.googlecode.com/files/SlimDX%20Runtime%20Net20%20%28June%202010%29.msi).
Istall both and run MachinimaDev.
Now follow the image.





Now the program will need some time to load everything


After the loading will appear a new window and we can choose what to extract:


i went to model/item and i choosed a weapon, double click to open in preview 


Now click to export,wait few second and click continue.


Choose the format 


Et voilà



I'M NOT ENGLISH SO SORRY FOR MY BAD ENGLISH

So what makes it different from any other model importer (eg: noesis) besides being not free? Is it like a modding tool where you can import models, change them, and export them back?

looks like it just takes known formats that already have free exporters and just charges people to export to obj. seems pretty lame.

The difference between this and noesis is only that with noesis you can't export from this game.

And this is the easiest and fastest way to export from there games

If it's just exporting textured meshes then it's pretty easy to do. 
Now if they actually have animation support, like holy crap full model exporting then I think it would be worth the money.

Don't know about fastest. Noesis provides command-line support and I don't think you can click and open files any faster than that lol

if you want wow models and anims just use.
[http://wowmodelviewer.org/forum/](http://wowmodelviewer.org/forum/)
this program looks like someone just took open source converters and shoved them together and charges money.
even the interface looks nearly identical to wow model viewer.

Yes I guess the main difference is that at this point, Noesis doesn't have support for it, and they do. And as a consumer that's all I would really care about.

Sorry for ressing an old thread, but does this still work? I mean, the program can be opened and used with the correct slim version, but there seems to be an infinite loading wait time with the components. Can someone test with windows 10?
