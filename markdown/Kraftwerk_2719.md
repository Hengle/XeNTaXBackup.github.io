hehe, it's from the DVD-album "Minimum Maximum"  I've bought it and it rocks. 

You'd think nowadays they might just sequence everything, but they don't. They have some sequencing for drums and basic rhythm, but the rest they play live! Sounds, effects, melodies etc!

Minimum Maximum ... thanks for the tip!

Strangely, I was never really aware of Kraftwerk. I always knew they existed and what type of music they produced, but still ...

Seems like I have a lot to catch up.
