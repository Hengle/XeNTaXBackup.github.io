- Post Title: Rail Shooter - Background FMVs (Carnevil Arcade)

Hello!

with daemon1s help (he did most of it) we were able to extract 3d models from the game!
see here: [viewtopic.php?f=16&t=21690](https://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=21690)

the game itself uses prerendered background FMVs, made in the second version of 3ds max, and places enemies via zbuffer behind objects.

the video files:
-extract carnevil chd with chdman
-drop raw image on daemon1s carnevilraw tool: [download/file.php?id=17509](https://forum.xentax.com/download/file.php?id=17509)
-tool will export multiple parts / find them already extracted here: [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1y0vAs5 ... sp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1y0vAs5ka4Z5kSKY7G1b6GNMMI3Pcg2UV/view?usp=sharing)

part0 contains all the 3d and 2d files.
the others contain the fmvs and audio.

since sounds and music have already been extraced, i kindly ask you guys to help us export the original background videos.
i personally would love to rebuild the 3d environment and rail from the video data

find a few stills of the fmv without spawned enemies here: [http://greelyvalley.weebly.com/fmv.html](http://greelyvalley.weebly.com/fmv.html)




we also have a discord group if you wanna join

thank you for reading and i hope the files are easily accesible

Yes this would be very nice to have. Unfortunately I do not have much experience with it though

we could try renaming the extracted file to .ogg and see what happens?
