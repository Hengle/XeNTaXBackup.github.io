Please can someone take a look at this and tell me the compression method used. I really need to get into these models. Any help at all will be greatly appreciated.

thanks for trying bro. All i know its some kind of encryption over renderware files. If I could ever find out what it is I could decrypt and convert them to 3ds format. The main reason i want to do that is so I can make sprites out of the 3d models to use for  2d characters for Mugen (a street fighter engine emulator). My ultimate goal is tyo be able to do this for dragonball and bleach games as well. But they all use the same engine. so mosre likely than not the same encryption
