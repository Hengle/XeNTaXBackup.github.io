- Post Title: Developing 3ds max script, need help pls

hey mates,

my english isnÂ´t good, so i will come directly to the topic.
is there somebody good @ developing max scripts?
i do have a script that have a import part for the unknown fileformat(mesh-typ) yet, but the export part is still needed.
because the mesh-typ is part of a game, and the game source code is public, i could give you some scripts, that maybe could help..
and i offer also money for it 40$. i will help you as good as i can.

thanks for reading mates,

have a nice weekend

If you want to export and you have the import, just change the reads to writes and you should get the job done 

Also would be nice to provide something else if you want some help.
