How can I edit this text file? I tried with notepad but then game doesn't start.

It's from game Safecracker.

Sorry again for my bad english  

Thanks!

12 byte magic ('STRv02.00.00')
dword dataOffset
dword stringCount

following structure * stringCount

dword maybeid
dword relativeOffset
dword length
dword unk4

following offsets (should end up @ dataOffset) are strings

skip relativeOffset bytes
read length for string
