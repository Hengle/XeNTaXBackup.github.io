- Post Title: Need help converting .brres files to a usable format

After ALOT of googling, I managed to find out how to rip models from Wii games and have ripped a bunch of models from  Naruto Shippuden Gekitou. I can view or convert them to .md5mesh or .psk in brresviewer or split them with Bres Split but I can't use them! I've spend the last week googling my ass off looking for 3D model converters that support .md5mesh, .psk, .brmdl, or .brres and come up short handed every time  
I've tried out mdlviewer v1.43 that has a Import / Export menu but it doesn't export the models. I also found a tool called md5mesh2obj, but when converted the .obj file had no vertexes! I also found another tool called brres2dae that works with collada and ssbextract, but I couldn't figure out how to even set it up. I've also tried reading documentation on each of the file formats to either convert them by hand or write my own converter in C++, but all of them confuse me!
Please, I'm desperate at this point   Does anyone know how I can convert these to .3ds, or .obj?

I've already seen that page. I did another quick glance though and noticed I missed the post about brawlbox and modelporter. I just tried it out, but for some reason it wouldnt let me preview the model :/ I exported it anyway and tried to import the .dae into blender, which again didn't work. I'm gonna try another model, but I'm really starting to lose hope here...


EDIT:
No luck whatsoever. It won't preview any of the model and the .dae files it exports don't import properly into blender. Does anyone have documentation on the .brres file format? I'm sick of coming up short and am just gonna write my own converter
