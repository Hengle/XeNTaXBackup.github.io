- Post Title: Splatterhouse 2010 NIF files

These are the one files I can't completely figure out (and given that almost all the files are xml files masked as other formats, that really wasn't hard).

This is what I do know:
*The header of the file is 20.5.0.0 , so this should open up in NifScope at the very least. Instead the program crashes outright when it tries to read any of these files.
*Despite what a thread on NifTools' website says, this isn't compressed with xbdecompress.exe. Try to use it and the program even tells you outright it's not compressed with it.

I can supply sample files as needed, but I could really use another set of eyes on this if anyone can help.

EDIT: And I just realized like an imbecile while jumping between windows I was posting this in the wrong form and can't delete it now --; If someone could move it...

I know it's a little late......almost 8 years haha
But I just stumbled across this version of Noesis with mviewer: [https://github.com/majimboo/mviewer](https://github.com/majimboo/mviewer)
I don't know why, but it handles the Splatterhouse 2010 .nif files!
Heres an example:


EDIT:
I also used this tool to unpack the "archive.psarc" in "USRDIR":


 PSARC Extractor 1.0.zip
Just drag and drop a ps3 .psarc - file on the exe to unpack (25.18 KiB) Downloaded 44 times



Hope I could help

IMPORTANT INFO   

My above mentionend method ONLY works with PS3-files. XBOX360 seems to not be supported by this noesis version!

EDIT:
skeletons and weightpainting are also supported!
