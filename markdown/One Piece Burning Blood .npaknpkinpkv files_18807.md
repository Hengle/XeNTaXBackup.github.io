- Post Title: One Piece Burning Blood .npak/npki/npkv files?

So I've been trying to rip the models from the PC version of OP:BB and even though I got past the weird scz compression on the files I still can't really get the npak/npki/npkv into any formats I can do anything with :/ I remember seeing chrrox saying they had a script for importing these files but as far as I know they've never released it so I'm at a bit of a loss here...if anyone could help me figure these out I'd really appreciate it.

Here's some sample files: [https://sta.sh/01fngeu50bqt](https://sta.sh/01fngeu50bqt) and [https://sta.sh/01v8c9ox62ho](https://sta.sh/01v8c9ox62ho)

Not sure which characters these are but I think the first one is Luffy based on the messing around i did in 3dmodelresearcher...managed to find the verts for his hat but that's as far as i got since i can never find the faces on models

I don't know about the script but I have posted some hex2obj examples on zenhax for a npki sample : [https://zenhax.com/viewtopic.php?p=37565#p37565](https://zenhax.com/viewtopic.php?p=37565#p37565) Might give you more insight.
