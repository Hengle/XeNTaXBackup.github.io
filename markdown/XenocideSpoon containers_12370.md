I remember seeing this before, but it's come up again as a potential data protection solution and I was wondering if there was any tools for this.

Basically, we can write an unpacker, but what happens if they decide to package the archive itself into another archive? We'd have to first get the archive itself before we can then get at the resources. And the archive itself is protected.

In this case, using Spoon to wrap the entire application.

Here are some samples: [http://1drv.ms/1sjyOs0](http://1drv.ms/1sjyOs0)

isn't the hook for this software "no installs"? if so, the application is hosted remotely, the client only has access to an interactive stream.

the client you download only communicates with the server to generate and stream your session.

They have the option of creating "stand-alone executables" that package up your entire application (kind of like how portable apps and such systems work)

Cloud deployment is also an option.
