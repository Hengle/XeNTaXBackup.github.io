- Post Title: How to edit assassin's creed Brotherhood subtitles?

Hi guys
I hope I didn't write the wrong place for the topic
I wanted to translate assassin's creed brotherhood subtitles. I used Ubisoft_DATA_Tool, Ubisoft_forge_Tool, aclocimport, aclocexport. I had no problem unpacking, but he had trouble packing and I couldn't.

Anyway, is there another tool for this?
