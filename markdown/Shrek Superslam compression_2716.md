- Post Title: Shrek Superslam compression

[download.php?id=1271](http://forum.xentax.com/download.php?id=1271)
This is a language file from the game Shrek Superslam. The compression seems to be something like LZ* It's necessary to identify it to be able to extract the files from the game's archives.

This is the original topic in the game research forum:

Any help appreciated.

I locate something with hexaeditor in the Master.dat and in my saves. It looks similarly. The first file is my save and second is cutting from master.dat.I think it can help you to find out how to unpack it.
