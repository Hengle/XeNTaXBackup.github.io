- Post Title: FF7 International Artwork

So, I'm trying to get the artwork of ff7 off the disc, but I have no clue how. I have the bin-cue files, but obviously they can't be read in windows, they do work with an emulator (at least PCSX, ePSXE doesn't).
The artwork looks cool and I'd like to upload it on TTR, so I'd appreciate your help.

So you have an disc image of PSX version in .bin+.cue file format, right?
First of all, you can convert it to .iso and mount using windows explorer.
After that you can find archives and use existing tools on them.

I found some help, thanks - unfortunately however it is not possible to get them without the background.
