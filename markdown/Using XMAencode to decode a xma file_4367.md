- Post Title: Using XMAencode to decode a xma file

Hello everyone, 
im new to the forum. 
I was just wondering if it was possible to extract the sound files from a game. I dont mean the music, i mean dialogue. If this is possible then how would i go about getting the game sound files.

I think the files are XMA files, but i wouldn't know how to use such tools like 'xmaencode' any help with this would be appreciated.

By the way the game i'm trying to do this from is an xbox 360 game called 'Lost Odyssey

Thanks.

Please help guys. 

Can't figure out the headers of these XMA files once they've been decoded.

Helpp!!

You really have to post a sample, just saying "XMA" doesn't mean anything, most audio on the 360 is XMA in one way or another.
Also you just have to be patient, [it sounds like bxaimc already ripped everything](http://hcs64.com/mboard/forum.php?showthread=19252), just give him time to sort through it all.

Sorry man. you must understand, im new to this ripping stuff. I wouldn't know the different between what to post or not lol. I've never done stuff like this before, half the stuff i don't even know how to use and i don't actually know what a header is . 

Sorry for the non-understanding
