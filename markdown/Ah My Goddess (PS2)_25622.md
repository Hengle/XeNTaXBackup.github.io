- Post Title: Ah My Goddess (PS2)

This game's models and textures appear to be stored on GRP.bin and there's no script/tools made to extract its content. It seems to have a list of names of its content at the beginning and the data it contains has a 'PKv0' header and they may have some kind of compression. I can find vertices of characters in Model Researcher but they come out flat probably because of that compression. I get better results on the vertices when I open the eeMemory with Model Researcher but I couldn't seem to find the faces. Would it be possible to make some script to extract the model/texture files from the eeMemory and at least get the meshes displayed on Model Researcher? It would probably be harder to get the models/textures from GRP.bin though because of some compression it may possibly have. I have also taken a portion from the eeMemory that I think contains some mesh data and I have made a list of offsets, counts and paddings where I can find some possibly proper vertices.

Here's the portion of eeMemory: [eememory_part](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1D_X7D_KqFjt7SMQgNiapxRtkjJ-nZexW)

```
offset: 0x12a2c4

padding: 84

The entire [eeMemory](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1G-cAMkRdDC57rF2wYD2Jn5xfC00vIx1N) and [GRP.bin](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1whSiinH1jqaKQbZY8284QRPmcLbVnXMX)

There have been a few mentions of this game here a long time ago but they didn't really got anywhere and nobody had taken a deeper look at it.

I managed to extract 3d models from pcsx2 memory dumping.
And wrote a simple maxscript to build 3d models without weight data.
Searching old disks atm,,not sure if i still keep the scripts..
I posted it on mariokart's forum,,which was closed.

what i remember is,,before the header,,there are few values need to be saved as array..
then you have to add those values into your polygon face index read from raw data..
That will be the real vertex index to generate 3d models.

ripped model.

do you remember what the forum was called? maybe its archived somewere?
anyway I think it would be better to go for the memory dump or eememory because the files in the grp.bin appears to be compressed (unless someone is willing to figure out the compression)
anyway hopefully you'll find the script

to rip the hex data for pcsx2,,you can use cheatengine.[https://cheatengine.org/](https://cheatengine.org/)
my OS got reinstalled lots of times..3dsmax is not installed atm.you have to wait a bit when i have time to check the scripts line by line later after i reinstall it.but file structure should be correct since i used it construct the models.

try to use maxsript cutsume2 import.ms
in the sample file i sent,,excute it and open cutsume2 import.dat
lots of things i don't remember it well now,,b/c it's ripped hex data,so it's file structure is not compelete..have to set a correct location to start reading the file,,,sorry,,it was done more than 10 year ago,really don't remember it well.

there is a file called cutsume2_log.txt.
if i remember it correct,it recored where you should read vertices count,face index data,try to use those values to edit my script and execute my script again.


```
"Reading Faces @ 0x33068"
"Last Read @ 0x3c3c4"

i totally forgot what 'last read' meaning now .lol

I checked few differnt characters dump,,only few characters working.This script is still not compelete.but you should be able to see it's basic vertex ,face index data pattern from the script.

error.png

change the line 35 in my script last posted.

```

```

0x144 ..this value is for cutsume2.dat
original should be 0x00000000  ,b/c it's ripped from memory,so i have no idea about it's header,,it's judged by lots of dumped data.

then you should be able to get the model. you have to use hex editor to look those model's pattern,should not be hard to judge the correct offset value.
