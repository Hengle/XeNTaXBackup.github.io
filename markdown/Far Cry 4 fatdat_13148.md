Hello people. Help with unpacking and packing patch.dat Far Cry 4. After updating the game to version 1.10.0 Utility Dunia 2 stopped working. The Dunia 2 tools extract common.dat/.fat perfectly, but for example patch.dat/.fat gives an error halfway through.

Hi, I'm looking for a way to Unpack/Pack Far Cry 4 fc4maps. The Dunia2 tools (Gibbed.FarCry3.CustomMap[Pack/Strip/Unpack]) only work on .fc3maps, would you happen to know a way?

I'm also interested in viewing FC3/4's heightmap.raw and holemap.raw, still got that on my list too.
