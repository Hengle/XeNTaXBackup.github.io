Hi if you're interested. You're better off asking here in my MHA discord for one justice ripping questions. Its mainly designed for vrchat community but you'll find more active rippers including myself on there. Edit: i have a general ripping guide for the game in one of the channels

How are you exporting this model?

Generally you export the model as gtlf via umodel. Then use blender 2.8 or 2.79 with kronos gltf addon. Sure you can use the psk format then import it via actorx 3dsmax but i recommend gltf because it has better mesh normals and vertex colors for shading purposes. Both methods should work just fine and the bones will rotate just fine.
