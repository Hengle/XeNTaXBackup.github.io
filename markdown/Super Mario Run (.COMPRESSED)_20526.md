- Post Title: Super Mario Run (*.COMPRESSED)

Continued from Zenhax: [https://www.zenhax.com/viewtopic.php?f=9&t=9108](https://www.zenhax.com/viewtopic.php?f=9&t=9108)

I want to view the .compressed files from Super Mario Run's text assets, but they are encrypted or compressed in some way I cannot figure out, any advice on decrypting and viewing these files? If so thanks.

Could be compressed with chunks, the MonoBehaviour for asset bundles say so and .encrypt was rejected.
