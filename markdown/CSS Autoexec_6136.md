- Post Title: CSS Autoexec

Hi all, I was wondering if anyone had a better autoexec for CSS, here is my current one, I would like one that get a lil better FPS and still saves some quality, I dont care for the models, but I like my textures high.

I repeat again and this is valid also for your other threads:
this is a forum about the reversing and extracting/repacking game archives and files, this is NOT a classical game forum.

so if you have a problem about a game archive that you don't know how to open (because you are interested in its content) and it has not been already covered in other threads ("search before post" rule) then YES you are in the correct forum.

if you have problems running a game, configuring it, cheating and other things you are NOT in the correct forum.

the following are the Xentax rules in case you have not read them:
[viewtopic.php?f=28&t=1270](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=28&t=1270)

just for my curiosity, how old are you?

Actually, this here [viewtopic.php?f=10&t=4153](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=4153) clearly states that I can post there here due to what it relates here. And to my previous post, the "running the game" concept went with the files I was requesting, if I could not receive them...

What is it with you people on these forums? You would rather bitch at somebody who needs help, rather than constructively helping them. This post is related to games, so with the link I posted above, this would be the proper forum. But these forums should not be about arguing were what should be posted, now is it?

And to satisfy your curiosity, I'm 20 years of age.

ah ah ah that post you linked is referred to the game tools blog which is a totally different thing and is even more selective than the forum :)

as far as I know everyone here receives at least a minimum of help for things that fit the various fields covered by the forum.

the only people who gets ignored are those that post things completely unrelated.
you have not been ignored just for the tentative of being a bit more constructive... time wasted.

> But these forums should not be about arguing were what should be posted
a forum about specific fields of the game world doesn't make it a general gaming forum.
it's exactly like going in a development forum about C or PHP and creating a thread about how use Photoshop, this is what you are trying to do and you still don't understand it.
but I'm sure that now it's clear.

*update*
the only section of the forum where you can post this type of thread is the off-topic one:
[viewforum.php?f=22](http://forum.xentax.com/viewforum.php?f=22)
maybe give a try

Maybe I understand a little better now, but this forum is for game archive research, and this is for my own research for a game, and I need help, so im posting on a forum were people seem to be above average with there experience in technology. sorry if im a pain.
