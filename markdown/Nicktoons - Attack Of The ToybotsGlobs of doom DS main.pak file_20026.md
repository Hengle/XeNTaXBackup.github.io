- Post Title: Nicktoons - Attack Of The Toybots/Globs of doom DS main.pak file

I have extracted the "main.pak" file from the Nicktoons - Attack Of The Toybots game, from the Nintendo DS, and the Globs of doom has the same file, in which seems to have the games resources. If anyone can help extract them, please feel free!

alright, looking further this archive is LZ77Wii compressed, but trying to decompress it gives me errors, and it seems to have a header of PAK0, and has multiple PAK0 files in it as well! there are some filenames like CN1_MenuScript_SMAPI. Could anyone help still? I'd love to mod this DS game lol.
