I hate to dig up an old topic, but I've been looking into DAH! pkg archives as well.  The first two DAH! games were done by Pandemic Studios, who also did Star Wars Clone Wars, Star Wars Battlefront 1/2 & Mercenaries (albeit DAH was done by the Australia branch).  It's quite possible that all games use Pandemic's Zero engine (as in-game there are many similarities).  The whole reason I bring this up from the dead is that those games use what they call 'munging' to build the files.  The file formats change twice between the start of the munge and compiled archive at the end.  So you may be looking into something that compiles into a DirectX format, as the other games did.  I've also noticed quite a few compiled LUA scripts in the PKG archive, which was interesting.

So.....4 years and nothing on this format. Great. lol @ "possible forum rules violation". It's now illegal to upload samples of game files?!
