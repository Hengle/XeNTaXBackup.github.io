Hi

I use [umodel](http://www.gildor.org/projects/umodel/tutorials) to extract files (textures, meshes, ...) from unreal game (.upk files)

But I have no idea that how can I re import this stuffs into the game!

Is there any solution?

There's no way to reinject anything unless the game is using UDK's standar file format (UPK). Normally, most of the games using UE3 have custom file formats. You can ask in gildor's forums for a better explanation.
