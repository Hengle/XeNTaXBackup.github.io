- Post Title: Final Fantasy XIII PC - Gameplay/Battle modding?

Would it be possible to modify the way this game handles battles? Instead of controlling just one character, I would like to have the ability to select commands for all 3 party members, and potentially disable the auto-battle command. I feel this would improve the gameplay of the game, however I have no idea how I'd go about doing it or where I'd even start. Any suggestions? I have access to the PC version.
