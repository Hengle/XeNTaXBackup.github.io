- Post Title: The Hunt For Melpharia Fantasy Earth Zero

We are a movement bringing back Fantasy Earth Zero for the gamers. Since Gamepot USA is no more & it is up for the taking we are trying to start a private server so old & new generations of players can enjoy this unique award winning gameplay that will be ran by the players so it can't be ruined by horrible managment publishers like Gamepot USA. Please message me or find us on Facebook at Bring Back Fantasy Earth Zero. Gamania, HK or NA Fantasy Earth Zero server files, scripts etc.
