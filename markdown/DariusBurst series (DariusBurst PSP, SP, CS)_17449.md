- Post Title: DariusBurst series (DariusBurst PSP, SP, CS)

It's been on my mind for a while, so here we go.
The series uses Criware (Except SP [Second Prologue], which uses Criware Mobile).
As such, there are some similarities between the games.
For images, and maybe, textures, both DariusBurst (PSP) and DariusBurst Chronicle Saviours (PC/PS4/Vita) use .tx2.
There's also a Scenes folder that uses a .xxi format, that looks like a novelty, and it's very small, along with .dxt formats used in a Data folder. Someone told me both formats, .xxi, and .dxt are dzipped, if that helps. I'll post samples from both games just for the sake if they are different in any subtle way.

As for DariusBurst Second Prologue (Android/iOS), being different, all the assets (except sounds) are stored in a big .bnd file. Since it's kinda ''all-in'', I would mostly await approval in order to post a link.

In any case, if DB CS will be succesful, access to DLC offered from SEGA, Capcom, CAVE and other more could be possible.

I appreciate all your efforts, big or small.
