- Post Title: Rampage Total Destruction

For some time now I been trying to rip models from the Wii version of Rampage Total Destruction with very little experience on ripping models from games the few things I did try from browsing forms that are years out of date but ether the links for the tools were 404 or the software they used had been updated I did find [https://www.models-resource.com/gamecub ... odel/7959/](https://www.models-resource.com/gamecube/rampagetotaldestruction/model/7959/) but there are 40 character models that have never been ripped. The tools I have tried are Ninja Ripper which dose not work for this game and 3d ripper DX which worked till they updated the software. Would be nice to see more people rip the models from this game.

Update I started to use Ninja Ripper 2.0.5 beta and it made some of the Ripping for this game alot easier but the in game shaders and lighting is quite glitchy. I have only used this on Dolphin 3.0 32bit and I use the Wii version of Rampage Total Destruction.
