I am trying to get the models for this game. I was able to export the model files from the Nintendo Switch cartridge. However, it looks like this game uses a different format from KOF14. So the KOF 3dMax script fails to load these.

Here is some sample files. This should be the first costume for Athena:

According to the DeviantArt post below. It looks like a script has already been developed by Chrrox. Unfortunately, I have been unable to locate this script.

Any help would be greatly appreciated
