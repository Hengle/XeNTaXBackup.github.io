As far as I'm aware, gsga (and gsgb) contain everything for a single model (textures, animations, geometry, ...)
There is no obvious way to split it up into individual files, so I didn't really look into it that much.

On Soul Master game the file is separated into gsga as the model file and dds as the texture. There also gsgb but I don't know what is that.
Btw what program did use to make gsga file?
