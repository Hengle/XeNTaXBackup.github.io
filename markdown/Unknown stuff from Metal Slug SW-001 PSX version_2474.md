- Post Title: Unknown stuff from Metal Slug SW-001 PSX version

I don't really know what to make of these files but they are littered around in the CD:

All I really need to know is... what are they? O_o I think one is some kind of image format or image aid but I can't make heads nor tails of them. They are TPC, TPV, SEL, and I think there is the BIN in there.

I didn't want to put this in a specific category because I don't know if they are a form of archive, pallette, image or what but I was noticing not all sprites seem to be in the TIMs O_o.
