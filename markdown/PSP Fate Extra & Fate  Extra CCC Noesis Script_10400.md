use the psp emulator with the option to decrypt files.
it will extract the cpk file to the tmp directory.

What do you use to extract *.im from *.pak?

Hello. Instead of posting a new thread, I think it'll be more appropriate to post here.

I succeeded finally at extracting the .psp.im file and it looks fine when previewed in Noesis

But when I export to .obj, it becomes like this
[](http://s285.photobucket.com/user/Hinata20795/media/elizabethbathory2.png.html)

I notice the .im file has 12 materials while the .obj only has 9 materials.. Can anyone help me to export it correctly?

There is another good tool to decrypt .PGD files and make other useful things.)

Does this work with any PSP game like Code Lyoko: Quest for Infinity? The game uses .gcn .cp2 .pc & .psp files.
