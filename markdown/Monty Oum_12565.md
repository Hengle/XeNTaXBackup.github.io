I'm sure a lot of people here are familiar with his work. I talked to him years ago about working on a project together, but once he started working on the RvB stuff I figured there was no way that would happen, and it seemed like his career really took off. Today this kind of came out of nowhere.

This is sad and shitty. If I weren't too old and unhealthy to drink any significant amount of alcohol without feeling like shit, I'd have a few beers in his name.

Very sad indeed. I applaud also his work on GBHSB, that he never admitted to publically, as our intelligence services pointed to him as the man behind the Girl Battle cut-scenes (the spicey ones).

He will be missed.
