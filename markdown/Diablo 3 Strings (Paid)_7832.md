- Post Title: Diablo 3 Strings (Paid)

I'm looking for a motivated coder that can build and maintain a tool to extract Diablo 3 strings (.stl) and game balance files (.gam). I have an existing toolset but the platform and output are less than ideal. I think it'll be a lot better if someone can code a Windows exe that I just drop the game files on and out pops converted csv files.

You'll be well compensated for the work, this isn't a random $250 job, I'm looking for someone accessible that can make changes down the road as needed.

If you're interested, contact me at mdurrant [at] gratisites.com

I have working D3 string editor based on beta files. But I'm waiting for final game to check changes.

I think I found my guy for this, thanks for the emails. I'll update if it ends up not panning out.
