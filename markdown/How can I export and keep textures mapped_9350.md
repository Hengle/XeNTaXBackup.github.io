- Post Title: How can I export and keep textures mapped?

Hey guys, is it possible for me to export the files and then just load them into Blender with the textures already mapped? I'm all good with loading the textures and mapping them. But it would make things so much easier if I could just load the files and have them already mapped.

Not to mention I am having problems with rendering textures in Blender.

Thanks in Advance. 

EDIT: Oh, sorry, I forgot to mention I am using models from Crisis Core in Noesis.

I think the gmo plugin had issues with texture exports.

I've got a similar inquiry, for what it's worth.  Trying to get Crisis Core stuff exported as .DAE format to include the textures and mapping, rather than splitting them off.
