- Post Title: File tags

The concept behind this thread is that on many file types, there is some sort of "identification tag" that you can use to uncover just what type of file it is (for example, jpeg images have a jfif (I think) tag, and wave sounds use a riff tag...).

If you submit a tag (or tags), please try to stick to this format:
Extensions Used | Is the tag Hexadecimal, or ASCII, or some other 'format'? (just write "Hex" or "ASCII") | MIME type(s) | the actual tag | any other notes

So for jpeg files, my submission would look like:

```
.jpeg           image/jpg 
.jpg            image/jp_ 
                application/jpg 
                application/x-jpg 
                image/pjpeg 
                image/pipeg 
                image/vnd.swiftview-jpeg 
                image/x-xbitmap

```

Please note, I would like these tags from mainly fairly common formats. I will post almost any tag you give me, though, if you can provide documentation of its use (only if it's not very common).

And here's the list... (in alphabetical order):

```
.jpeg           image/jpg 
.jpg            image/jp_ 
                application/jpg 
                application/x-jpg 
                image/pjpeg 
                image/pipeg 
                image/vnd.swiftview-jpeg 
                image/x-xbitmap
---------------------------------------------------
.wav | ASCII | audio/wav | RIFF | Sound format
                  audio/x-wav 
                  audio/wave 
                  audio/x-pn-wav
```

As much as I like the idea, and want to cooperate, this looks a lot like the chap at [http://filext.com](http://filext.com) is doing. Try browsing there and search for 'BMP' for instance. He's got all the stuff there.

General Notes  
Various programs use this extension; too many to list individually. Take clues from the location of the file as a possible pointer to exactly which program is producing the file. The file's date and time can also help if you know which programs you were running when the file was written.
