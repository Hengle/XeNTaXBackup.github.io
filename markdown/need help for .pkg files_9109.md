rename your folder.
also use the command line not double clicking.
example

c:\quickbms.exe c:\test.bms c:\file.pkg c:\extract_folder

Do not want to bother,since this post was answered several months ago,but I have the same problem and did not want to open a new post.

I open quickbms,then load the bms script ( [http://aluigi.altervista.org/papers/bms/aeriagames.bms](http://aluigi.altervista.org/papers/bms/aeriagames.bms) ),then I choose the file I want to decompress from Grand Fantasia (pkg001.pkg for example) and finally choose the folder to which files go.

And as you can see the image of the user oframa99,I get this error.

-Error in src\file.h line 178: myfopen()
Error no such file or directory.

What am I doing wrong? I have the latest version of quickbms and Grand Fantasia.
Am I trying to unpack the wrong file?Does the script is correct?

I hope someone can help me because I have gone through all the possible issues with no results.
