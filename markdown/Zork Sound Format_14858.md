- Post Title: Zork Sound Format

Hello

I need help with the modified PCM Audio which i found in the latest Zork games Nemesis and Grand Inquisitor. Both use somehow a PCM variant. I have found no decoder which works. All i found is a thread about that format: [https://www.thezorklibrary.com/forum/vi ... .php?t=641](https://www.thezorklibrary.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=641)

I have uploaded some audiotracks and the exe from both games: [http://www.xup.in/dl,19404266/Zork.zip](http://www.xup.in/dl,19404266/Zork.zip)

Can someone help me please.

Thanks

Have anyone tried ffmpeg? I looks like some avi Zork tracks can be decoded with ffmpeg. ffmpeg has an encoder for some files: zork_pcm

However i was unable to decode the Raw Sound Files. It looks like ffmpeg support only the avi files from these games. A full working decoder would be really great
