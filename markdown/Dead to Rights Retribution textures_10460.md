Hello! 
I'm working on DTR:R models import. I've managed to achieve some success,  but totally stuck with textures. I thought they are headerless .dds files but adding header didn't help much, because textures didn't look right. I guess, I'm missing and don't understand something. I will be very grateful if someone could provide any tip or advice about them. Thanks in advance.

Sorry to bump this thread but recently got this game and was wondering if these tools were ever released?
