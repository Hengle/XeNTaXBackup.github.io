This game uses a very similar format to Alien vs. Predator 2010 and Snipers Elite.

They did make the PS2 / PSP / Wii versions, but not the PS3 / 360 versions.

(In case someone feels adressed: I'm just referring to a joke howfie made.)

rebellion games were quite interesting... to this day, it's the only game that i have ever seen that uses ONE vertex format/input layout for everything. even crates have 0 0 0 0 FF 0 0 0 for each vertex even though they aren't animated.

in zombie army trilogy the devs were also so lazy that to add female models to the trilogy they took female heads from their other games and pasted them on male bodies.
