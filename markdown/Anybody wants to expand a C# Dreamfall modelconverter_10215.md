- Post Title: Anybody wants to expand a C# Dreamfall modelconverter?

hi, i would like to give some locations in [Dreamfall: The longest journey](http://tlj.wikia.com/wiki/Dreamfall) an overhaul but that is not possible with the current version of dreamviewer, the modelviewer/converter. it is already really extensive, being able to read the archives and display aswell as convert models, textures, animations and weights.
the only things that are missing are:
-import and export of shader association and multiple texture associations
-support of the second UV channel for lightmaps
-static model import
(-splitting locations into individual models and name them properly)

dreamviewer was written in C# and the sourcefiles are avaible here: [http://pingus.seul.org/~grumbel/dreamfall/](http://pingus.seul.org/~grumbel/dreamfall/)
im primarily a modeler and just a beginner at programming. i understand nearly nothing of the code so i would like to know if anybody here is interested in expanding the tool.
i guess programming these features would be a rather easy task for someone experienced with 3d formats but then again i dont know much about that so i cat guarantee it.

i wasnt sure whether to post this in the gametoolsection but i decided aganst it because its no release of a new tool.
