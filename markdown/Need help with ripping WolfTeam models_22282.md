- Post Title: Need help with ripping WolfTeam models

I am a big fan of WolfTeam and want to rip the wolf models from the game, but what happens during the process is strange. I have seen a person with the WolfTeam models that I want on sketchfab, however they are not downloadable, but when I try to rip the models myself (I use Ninja Ripper), the game will tell me to uninstall the client and reinstall it again (This error appears in the main menu of the game where you can create servers and quick join others, and the client is the game, not Ninja Ripper), but this can easily be fixed by deleting the .dll file that has been injected by the Ninja Ripper program instead of reinstalling the whole game, but as we all know, the .dll file is needed in order to rip 3D models from games, so how do I get past the "Uninstall the client and reinstall it again" error in the main menu so that I can rip the models that I need? I suggest you guys download the game and try ripping models from it in case you want to know exactly what I am talking about.

Really big thanks to Luigi Auriemma, who wrote a bms scrip for the archive type after I have sent him the samples.

Thanks again!

hi bro it is export wolfteam model and texture but it is dont convert file(.ltb, .DTX). I do not know how to convert models and textures, but I was doing research, I managed to open some models but most of them are problematic. I apologize for making the subject come alive
