Hi,
You are not alone in this brother. I have searched and tried a dozen way to get to bf3 3d models with little luck. The closest I have got was using Nvidia`s parallel nsight. You can capture a frame from graphics card buffer and inspect it, view textures used (in 3d overlay manner) and you can view 3d models in their original state. But I could not find much use of them. But hey give it a shot you never know what you might step on to ;]]]
