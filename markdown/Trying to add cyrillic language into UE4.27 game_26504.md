- Post Title: Trying to add cyrillic language into UE4.27 game

Hello everyone,

I need some help with implementing a Ukrainian translation into "Like a Dragon: Ishin!", but I'm facing issues. As you may know, Ukrainian consists of cyrrilic characters, and most games do not support them natively, so it's hard to make any progress when translating the game.

I've managed to unpack, edit and re-pack the files back into the .pak archive and then launch the game, but the letters look awful, you may check the example in the attachment. Thus, I'm trying to understand how one can enable the language and/or replace the English with it, and have properly looking characters (I've checked - there are fonts for cyrrilic characets in game's files).

If you need more information, just ask - I'll try my best to provide it. Any help is appreciated.

Have you tried editing the .ufont font? It's just a .ttf
