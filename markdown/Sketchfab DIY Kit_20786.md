Rules: No ripping. No asking. No Discussion. (Except maybe technical improvements and fixes, if you got them)

 LINK REMOVED

Known issues (don't ask about it, i haven't coded it - just prepared):

- Models using Vertex Colors are not supported.
- Models using Multiple or unusual UV-Layer combinations are not supported.
- Models using Morphtargets and/or full-body vertex animations are not supported.
- Reference poses are partially supported. You have to add the armature modifiers to all meshes manually and it doesn't have a hierarchy.

As far as I can see this is still targeted at getting models from the website? Looking at the tutorial? Then host it elsewhere, but not here. We will not start a new thread here discussing these matters.
