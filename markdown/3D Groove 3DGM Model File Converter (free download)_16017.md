3DGM Model File Converter
Scripted By TOMYSSHADOW
Version 1.0
--------

This is a converter for 3DGM Model Files and related files found in .DCR and .GRV archives. It's written in JavaScript using DataStream.js . Simply open the included .htm file in a browser and click Browse, and find a .3GM (or .3DG if you used offzip to extract an archive and it guessed the extension) file to use the converter.

Tested with:
Pale Moon 27.1.2
Vivaldi 1.7.735.46

Can convert:
Faces with any number of vertices
Named Objects
Textures
UVs

Cannot yet convert:
Legacy Acme3D .3D files
More advanced textures
Smoothing groups
Animation

I may end up rewriting this converter in Python in the future now that Version 1.0 is finished.

This is the first converter I'm posting on this forum! In the future if I ever write converters I'm going to avoid JavaScript, I just was using DataStream.js for the first time and wanted to learn how to use it. Hopefully this is useful for someone.
