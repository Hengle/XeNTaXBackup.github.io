- Post Title: IDOLM@STER Starlight Stage

It's an iOS/Android game developed on Unity engine
Is it possible to get the assets somehow, provided that they are being downloaded when the game needs them(like they aren't in the .apk file to begin with)
This is the video of the gameplay if anyone's interested: [https://youtu.be/XV6M-H4cNcI](https://youtu.be/XV6M-H4cNcI)
