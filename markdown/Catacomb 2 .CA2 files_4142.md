- Post Title: Catacomb 2 .CA2 files

The files from this game have the extension .CA2, What i am trying to
do is find a way of opening/extracting them. they contain the graphics
for the game (both CGA and EGA). The CGACHARS.CA2 and EGACHARS.CA2
files contain the game sprites, the CGAPICS.CA2 and EGAPICS.CA2 contain
screens, icons, menu graphics etc. Samples are below.

Samples:
