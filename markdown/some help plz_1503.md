please note that multiex is a game archive extractor, it extracts files from gaming archives, these files maybe known or may not be known

For example, it can extract WAV files from an archive if there are WAV files in the archive, but it might not be playable because you don't have the right codec.  Or the file could be an internal format used by the game makers which no one knows the format too.

What game is this about? 
Most of the time, I do a google search for certain fileformats I find in a package. Some can be opened, other can't.

Soundfiles can be played in Game Audio Player most of the time.
