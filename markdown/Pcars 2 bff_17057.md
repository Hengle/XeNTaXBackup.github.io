I ripped a bff file of pCars2, but I cannot open meb files on 3dsimed and Chipi's SMS importer
Certainly, new script and patch should be created.

Newest bms script (bff)

Not sure why none of these persons have tried this, but pcars 2 does unpack the vertex coordinates in ram when you are displaying said file on screen, a simple copy paste on the files does fix the obscure X coordinate, maybe that way people can figure out the Algorithm...
