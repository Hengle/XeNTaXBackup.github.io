- Post Title: Exporting the looping section of a FSB.

I have an FSB with a looping section, and every single converter destroys the looping sample. I'm trying to extend these sounds to run over a minute, but there's no program I have found that you can set the duration the converted wav must exceed using this looping section.

vgmstream ([https://hcs64.com/vgmstream.html](https://hcs64.com/vgmstream.html)) can play and loop most FSB types, it may work for your file.
The command line utility can also export wavs with loops points, or print loop info without decoding.
