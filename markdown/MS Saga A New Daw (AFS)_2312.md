- Post Title: MS Saga: A New Daw (AFS)

Example file attached using the cutter. This particular archive is on a PS2 disc.

Usually AFS files are used to store music data for some PS2 games, but in this instance, apparently not-- the game is storing almost ALL it's data in one giant freaking archive that's not a normal AFS file, and nothing I've tried has been able to open it thus far. Hopefully you guys can shed some light on the subject.

My eventual goal is to be able to extract the music from this file since this game has great music, but there's no official soundtrack.

edit: If it helps any, the base directory of the disc has the following files:

-0FLISTDV.DIR (no idea)
-AFSLIST0.AFS (largest file there, it's obviously the main archive)
-DMY.BIN (no idea)
-SLUS_212.70 (also no idea
-A file named SYSTEM with no extension (this is on every PS2 disc, so I'm assuming it's part of the OS)
-A subdir named IOP with a bunch of what look like stuff for the graphics and sound engine of the game (lots of IRX files)

Edit: [This](http://rapidshare.com/files/9182757/AFSLIST0.AFS1.zip) link is more current than the attachment, use it instead.

BTW, if you need me to upload bigger cuts or some of the other files on the dvd (size permitting), I can do that too.

aww, haha my rapid share downloads are max for today >_<

anyway what programs have you used? afs is a pretty widely used archive format, and for the most part seems to be the same, for every game i've seen thus far.

But if your looking for music, use a praser such as media cube, it might prase something out of the disc. if not you could half ass it, and record the sound from the TV. just hope the game enables you to disable voices and sound effects.

I've tried adxutil and Dragon Unpacker so far, as well as the thingy on this site. The problem is, the afs isn't a standard afs, apparently, so those can't read it.

Not sure what Media Cube is, I'll try looking for it. As for recording from the TV, the problem with that is that the game has no sound test in it.

Just how did you create this AFS file ? It's full of references to Xentax stuff? Complete html pages from the Xentax wiki can be found in there?!

I can only assume the file cutter you used to create the snippets fucked up and addressed whole other files still in memory.

That explains that. I used one of the cutter tools listed on the wiki, and it hung a reeeealy long time when I put in a big amount (since the first cut came out blank).

Is there a better one I can use?

edit: hurf, I should try the other one first.

Could the problem be that the cutters arn't intended to work on files 1.49 GB in size?

Also, splitting's in progress now. I'll upload a chunk when I'm done.

AFS Explorer doesn't like it either. I'm beginning to think that it's a different archive format that just happens to have the extension AFS.

O____o

OK, lemme try this again, instead of splitting the file I'll just rar it entirely and then upload the whole thing like that.

I know what happened with this last one, for some reason rapidshare didn't show the link to the newly uploaded file right away and I clicked too fast thinking that was it. Should have realized from the file size. >.<

If you can zip 1.5 gigabyte in 3MB, it must be largely an empty file. 

:/

EDIT: Indeed it is. It's for 97.5% 0 bytes. And again, this is probably not an archive at all. It's junk from whatever was in your memory. You a regular Something Awful visitor? Cause now it's not the Xentax WIKI I can see in there, but snippets from Something Awful webpages.

The problem has GOT to be with rapidshare at this point. Mabye it's because I'm uploading to it with firefox?

edit: confirmed, I'm having no troubles extracting it on my end. Stand by, I'll put it on my streamload.

Decided to stop futzing around and just do it your way instead of taking shortcuts, so I split the thing with filesplitter and here's one of the pieces, hope this will do it.

This is becoming quite aggravating, and I wish I could figure out why rapidshare hates me.

edit: Actually it may not be rapidshare at all. I opened a random split file with wordpad and it was completely blank. Mabye the AFS file didn't get copied from the DVD properly? o.x

Edit again: OK, I'm gonna try to split it using the file on the PS2 DVD directly. If this doesn't work, then I dunno what to try next. The results of that will be appended to my next post. 

Further edit: It apparently didn't work. I'm going to try to just make a disk image and upload THAT somewhere. x-X

Morning, folks. I uploaded an image of the DVD overnight. No more freaking archive problems!

You'll need Alcohol 120% to mount this. Note to silly people: this won't work if you burn it and put it in your PS2, and you shouldn't anyways as that's illegal!.  Fortunately, gigeshare downloads super fast so all this should be done pretty quick.

Removed links to image

Uhhhh... I don't think uploading DVD images is allowed at all.

I'm open to suggestions as to what else to try since it seems every attempt to get a chunk out of the archive file from the DVD itself just makes me end up with random junk instead of an actual piece.

Please don't post the entire creative contents of a game, even if the finished download doesn't work.

...even the image doesn't work?

*dies* x_x

Ok, I'm open to suggestions at this point. I know it's not a bum disc because it works in my PS2 fine.

It belatedly occured to me that the problem may be because I don't have as much ram as the filesize of the file I'm trying to snip.

Therefore, having made a snip of the file on a computer with more RAM than my own, here you go.

This hopefully will work. I checked the files in the archive first, and they do seem to be full of stuff rather than empty space.

Sorry, been busy. Now we are getting somewhere! Can you still cut a bigger piece out of them? Say 1 Mb instead of 256K? That would really help. I'm sure I can crack it it then. I'm already far with it!

Booya! And no prob, I'll have one up as soon as I can access the computer I used to take this chunk with.

Was I correct that this is a completely different format of .AFS?

Well, this is an actual file with content, not sure if the format is different, but I will be able to extract stuff from it.

I think it has somthing to do with bandwidth. Bigger files take more bandwidth.

Well, we could allow larger files, but as Darkfox said, that would increase bandwidth and our costs.  Perhaps we can up it sometime in the near future though.

True enough. Might an alternative be putting a list of sites to host things on in the wiki or something?

Probably under Game Requests would be the best.

Check the AFS Explorer tool, perhaps it will work now that you have an actual AFS file to explore. Use it on the file you used to create the cut pieces.

Success. I extracted the stuff on the other person's computer, and ADX Explorer was able to extract it, then I used ADXUtil to convert it. Sounds fine. 

On another note, I do believe it's time for me to buy a) more RAM and b) a new DVD drive... -_-
