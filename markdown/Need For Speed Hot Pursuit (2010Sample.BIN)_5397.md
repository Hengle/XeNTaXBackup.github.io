Hello,

As NFS has been released, I thought id start a topic as eventually this will be a game that everyone may look at.. For either modding or extracting the cars. The file format is .BIN I believe just like the old NFS games.

You can get a sample file Here!

(Preview of how the files are set out)

If anyone wants to have a crack at the format and needs something else or another sample, just let me know.  

Apologies if in the wrong section.
