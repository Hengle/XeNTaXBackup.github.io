- Post Title: OGG File Doesn't Play

Hello.

I'm trying to extract the music from Saints Row IV Inauguration Station. 

The files are vpp_pc files.

There seem to be 2 files with music in them. sounds_common.vpp_pc and sounds.vpp_pc.
I've extracted both files with HyperRipper and got a bunch of .wav files. Those didn't play 
because they were in RIFF format so I converted them with "riffwave2ogg.bat" which I got
from this forum. I had to use the newest version of ww2ogg.exe to get it to work.
 All the .ogg's from sounds.vpp_pc work but they're songs from Saints Row: The Third,
no idea why they are in Saints Row IV but anyways, the .ogg files from sounds_common.vpp_pc
don't work, they simply won't play. I've tried to convert them to .mp3 wth various online converting
sites but with no luck.

I've attatched one of the files, maybe someone can look into it, I'd greatly appreciate it.

no its the steam character creator "demo" which has some voices and background music. I'll see if i can convert from it, but if it converted to ogg successfully, next step is normally revorb.exe on each file

Edit:
didn't work for me, when revorb crashes it normally means you decoded wrong. try using ww2ogg with newer codebooks option?

Newer codebooks option? What do you mean by that?

download this, it's got two bat files set to use the newer codebooks and revorb after that.

put the wav's in this folder, run 0.bat, then after it finishes run 000001.bat to revorb all .ogg's outputed by the first script.
