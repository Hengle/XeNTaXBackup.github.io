Would you happen to have made some progress on this? From the files I've been given access to it seems like dunia2-r179_b116 (from 2015) supports unpacking the sound datfiles. None of the others though, According to [https://www.janne252.com/blog/view/id/3 ... d-ability/](https://www.janne252.com/blog/view/id/3/title/first-look-at-far-cry-primal-and-its-mod-ability/) it's possible that the ZLib used by Primal is not supported by Dunia. Wish I knew how to update the code at [http://svn.gib.me/public/dunia2/](http://svn.gib.me/public/dunia2/) to add support, I'm thinking the rest of the file system would very much match Far Cry 4...

I know he's busy at the moment with MGSV anims, but daemon1 is a wizard at this sort of stuff... he might be able to help if you reach out to him...
