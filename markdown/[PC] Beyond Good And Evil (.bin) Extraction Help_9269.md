- Post Title: [PC] Beyond Good And Evil (.bin) Extraction Help

Hello all. What a uniquely wonderful forum I stumbled on. Anyways, out of curiosity I wanted to look into the individual data files, Specifically the textures and character models of Beyond Good And Evil. I'm at a snag currently with those .bin files. I am looking in the right location aren't I? I need a little help on the extracting these.bin files. Would it be possible for me to use QuickBMS with a script from a different program that's was not officially written for use with BGAE that supports .bin?

Thanks.

I tried unpacking the bin files with the Jadepack.exe program. No anvil. It doesn't seem to be working because I know I'm doing something wrong. 

Here is what I tried t do:
1. Open cmd.exe
2. Locate Jadepack.exe, drag it over to cmd.exe and launch it. 
3. Have xxxx.bin file in the same directory with Jadepack.exe
4. Drag xxx.bin file into cmd.exe, so to get the file-path without typing it all out. 
5. make it so it reads: C:\... Jadepack.exe -d xxxx.bin xxx.dec
6. When I press enter, it tells me that the xxxx.bin file can not be opened. 
7... Huh? 

So the program won't work. I don't know what I'm doing wrong. After everyone is done face palming themselves, it wouldn't hurt to correct me a little.

Edit to add: I figured out how to properly use the program. Unfortunately, the program gives me an error when it tries to decompress the xxxx.bin file into a xxxx.dec file. 

What other methods can I also try?

Here's a screenshot of what happens when I try to unpack a .bin file using jadepack.exe

You can't see it, but a error happens and thus the extraction fails... creating a empty .dec file.

And the same result from a different program:
