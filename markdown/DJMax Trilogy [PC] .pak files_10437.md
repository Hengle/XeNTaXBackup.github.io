- Post Title: DJMax Trilogy [PC] .pak files

Alright. I am not very knowledgeable at all in this game file cracking thing so i donated to see if you guys could help me. I want to unpack .pak files from the game DJMAX trilogy for PC. I cannot find any way to open them and i have looked all over the web. This is what i know so far.

- Judging by a hex editor the .pak files seem to be encrypted in XIP3 (maybe?). 
- The entirety of the game is in .pak files. Aside from launcher executable and a few dll files in the root directory, every data file is compressed in .pak files.
- The root directory has a zlib1.dll
- After searching around it seems that they might be compressed with XOR symmetrically. (don't know what that means)

I would like to be able to extract and/or edit these files for modding the game. I believe i cannot post any game files on this forum because its against the rules (although i see other people posting game files in this forum).

So its compressed with lzo1x with no encryption? What is XIP3 then? What else is missing before you can make a script/tool?

File names encrypted.
