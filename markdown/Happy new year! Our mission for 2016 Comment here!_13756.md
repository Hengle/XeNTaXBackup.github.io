Hello to everyone, and a very happy and awesome 2016!

2015 has seen growth of our community versus previous years, with the past 6 months giving rise to the figures you see above (monthly average). 
Sure, we are in a very S.P.E.C.I.A.L. place, with highly intelligent and dedicated members bringing reverse engineering joy to the game modding world since 2003. 

However, our little corner of the internet has provided those boldy enough to browse to our HTTP with ~96,000 posts about file formats from a countless number of new games since we started. With great moderation by our awesome team of mods and admins, that had to do a difficult job every once in a while when I went blimmin' crazy and messed the forum up. 

All of these posts can be found in 11,105 threads started by a (elite  ) selection of the 26,096 members that signed up these past years. Mind you, [we have purged the forum once](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=28&t=2361&hilit=purge), and we may do it again! 
Even though our forum software has registered about 20,000,000 views in total of your posts, we think we can still do better than that.

Our community has spawned some really, and I mean REALLY excellent tools, and has been a platform for many a talented person to show off their skills and programs! You all know who they are!

I personally hope we can add many more to those ranks, making sure 2016 is even better than last year, hell, making 2016 the top year since 2003. 
Is that bold enough? You've seen the numbers above; at the end of 2016, what new numbers would we be happy with ? Comment below! 
And why not use the picture above to send around to your fellow smart people as an invitation to join our community if they haven't already? 
And don't forget our FB page as well, easy sharing ! 

Cheers to you all, 
Mr.Mouse
