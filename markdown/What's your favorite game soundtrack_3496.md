Just recovered my old soundtrack I once ripped off of Conquest: Frontier Wars. I love that one.
Any other nice music you've encountered?

During the countless times I've played Ascendancy (space x4 game) I've really come attached to the tracks. 

I uploaded them once by request:
[http://www.xentax.com/audio/theme00.mp3](http://www.xentax.com/audio/theme00.mp3)
[http://www.xentax.com/audio/theme01.mp3](http://www.xentax.com/audio/theme01.mp3)
[http://www.xentax.com/audio/theme02.mp3](http://www.xentax.com/audio/theme02.mp3)
[http://www.xentax.com/audio/theme03.mp3](http://www.xentax.com/audio/theme03.mp3)
[http://www.xentax.com/audio/theme04.mp3](http://www.xentax.com/audio/theme04.mp3)

Also, I was blown away by the music in Command and Conquer 1. That was really something at the time, and still! 

I really love the music in Morrowind, simply brilliant. 

And not to forget, the music in Doom (1).

And finally on my growing list is WarCraft 2. I could hum along all the tracks while playing yet another battle.

Here's my favorite from Conquest, background music for the terran player: [http://ul.to/o2vhbo](http://ul.to/o2vhbo)

Oh and of course I forgot the loading music for the El Alamein map in BF42, addicted to that one  [http://ul.to/0tdf6y](http://ul.to/0tdf6y)

Hmm i dont know if i can pick a favirote game soundtrack to be honest.


Il give  alittle list instead

Final Fantasy 8 (as you can guess from my name...i love this game...and its OST)
Final Fantasy 7
Metal Gear Solid 1 (enclosure...is just an epic tune...makes me so sad...though i am easily moved by music...).
Klonoa: Door to Phantomile (Its got some seriously happy songs).
Sonic Adventure 2 (mainly just a few levels and the themes for the Chao area's)
Sonic 3..(im sorry but seriously...can anyone say that ICE CAP ZONE 1 ISNT an amazing song...).

Thats all i can come up with right now.
I listen to a lot of movie OSTS though, right now im hooked on the Crows ZERO OST.

Here's some midi files from Doom. I remember back in the day I heard them in Adlib. Still, you get the idea.

I can't say much for oldies (or games in general, I really don't play enough...  ), but I've grown quite fond of the theme to Mirror's Edge, and one of the tracks for level 8.

As said over there: Warcraft II, Doom I, Ultima Underworld I, HoMM II to IV, Age of Empires, Tetris (haha), Neverwinter Nights I (supreme ambient music by Jeremy Soule)...

These are the ones I have in my head. If I had to mention those which I've found simply "good", but I don't remember now, it may take me a complete book

Can't believe no one else has pointed this out yet, but [Koji Kondo's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koji_Kondo) stuff is nothing short of classic (not sure a lot of it could be called soundtracks, but even so...).

Just for the record, here's some of the soundtracks The Gee and I were referring to 

(actual C64 recordings!)

Crazy Comets
[http://fonix.dyndns.org:40000/soasc/MOS ... 02.sid.mp3](http://fonix.dyndns.org:40000/soasc/MOS6581R2/MUSICIANS/H/Hubbard_Rob/Crazy_Comets_T02.sid.mp3)

Zoids

Commando

Hey, I covered Commando on my Commodore Amiga: http://www.xs4all.nl/~michael/Commando.mp3

Wizball

But come to think of it, Ghouls'n'Ghosts music is also great stuff:

Oh and if you're looking for XeNTaX's C64 tunes:

[http://soasc.dirtcellar.net/](http://soasc.dirtcellar.net/) Search for Releaser: Xentax. 

Mind that you have to pick the right SID chip for the sound to be the way we created those tunes. The 6581 was the old one and had a number of revisions. The R2 and R4 were common, but had different filter settings. Then came the 8580R5 which again was totally different. All of my tunes from 1993 on were done on a 8580, but before that a 6581R3. Not in the list at the website, so the sound will be off.

the differences can be huge, especially when using filters and influencers. That is why in later tunes i did not use them al together anymore........

Another one not listed here, was Beyond Good & Evil.  For some reason, that soundtrack was VERY well done.

First of all MAFIA<3 and then my favorite quest Dreamfall from the first one "the Longest Journey" to the latest Dreamfall Chapters. 
But I think there should be a thread about the WORST game soundtracks, like the music of every Sims game ever - that shit can make you go bonkers if you listen to it long enough
