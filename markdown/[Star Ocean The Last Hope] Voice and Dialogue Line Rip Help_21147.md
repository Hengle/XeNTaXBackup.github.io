- Post Title: [Star Ocean: The Last Hope] Voice and Dialogue Line Rip Help

Trying to decrypt and hopefully unpack and rip all the voice and dialogue files of the game. Specifically trying to get Reimi and Welch's voice lines. Thus far I've managed to unpack the 0000.bin and the 0001.bin files with this [https://github.com/RikuKH3/so4pc_pack](https://github.com/RikuKH3/so4pc_pack)

But it's all .pack, .pkg, and .dat files under that. And I think the files are broken. There's a decent amount of .aac files right inside 0000.bin but I think it's just music and menu UI sfx. Would really like some help here.

I'd much prefer to be able to get the raw voice files rather than going in-game and recording it with everything but voice audio turned off.
