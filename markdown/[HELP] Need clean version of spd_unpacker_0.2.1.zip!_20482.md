- Post Title: [HELP] Need clean version of spd_unpacker_0.2.1.zip!

A long while ago I downloaded spd_unpacker  with no problems

However, now it seems that the file contains a virus (Tilken.A!cl) and I cannot locate any mirrors for this file.

Does anyone have a clean version of this file or is this a false positive?
