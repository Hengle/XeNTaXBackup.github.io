- Post Title: NFS Underground - menu resolution

In NFSU value of resolution separately for Frontend (menu) and for Global (race). For Global game have 5 values (0 - 640*480; 1 - 800*600; 2 - 1024*768; 3 - 1280*960; 4 - 1280*1024) and they can be found in .cfg file (RES parameter). I can define custom resolution for Global with Uniws, which modified .exe file (only cracked). But Frontend have constant resolution (800*600) and this program not working on it. Can someone help to find this value? And really change it to 1920*1200, for example?
