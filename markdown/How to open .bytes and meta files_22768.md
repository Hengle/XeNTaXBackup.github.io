- Post Title: How to open ".bytes" and "meta" files?

There is a weapon model from one game "World of Guns Gun Disassembly".
as_val_webgl.unity3d when I unpack it using "Unity Studio".
Inside there are two files "as_val.bytes" and "as_val.bytes.meta". How can I open these files?
(P.S. I need a model for my game)
files are attached, at the link below
