- Post Title: transferring animation to another game

Hello guys,

Anyone can share a tutorial on how to use animation and import to a specific online game?
I've been watch youtube videos but I can't still find any solution. 
I was able to map the biped to another game model(Tantra Online), but the problem is the result of the mesh after mapping the skeleton



However, when checking the animation there's nothing wrong with it



Do I need to skin the mesh again to fix it?
Please help, thank you in advance 

Note: Sorry if I posted on a wrong thread. I don't know which section should I post this one

Motion builder and iClone 3d exchange let you do that. I did exactly that using some MMD motions some months ago with iClone:

Does this apply to any model format or on a specific format only? The model I used on the image is a .tmb file which is from the game Tantra online. I used to fix the bones using the animation however after mapping the mesh messed up.
