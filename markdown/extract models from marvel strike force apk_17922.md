You didn`t something wrong. The problem is, we need the full file inside the device. The full apk is 965 MB more or less.

Hello. I don't post much here, I'm a modder in Marvel Mods forums and I'll like to have the Thanos model from this game, I think I can retexture it to make it look like the MCU Thanos.
I don't know wich file have the models in. I tried to open the data files with assetsbundle extractor but no luck finding any mesh. Any help would be nice. Thanks in advance.

You need the full files .apk. The problem is you tried open a simple file with 175 mb more or less. You must need the full file 945 mb more or less.

No you don't need the whole 945mb to get them. Julio Cabral get Thanos from "characters_thanos.assetbundle"
