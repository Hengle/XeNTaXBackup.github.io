- Post Title: Auto Club Revolution [Models export??]

So, It's time for this game, It's got really high detailed car models and some of them aren't present in other racing games.
Well some technical info: Cars are stored in .zip files, inside them there are two folders "vehicles" and "cars".
In the first one, we've got textures in ".dds" format but secured in ".tex". In second one there are (I think) parts of the car probably meshes stored in ".arc" format.
The second thing is that I don't understand why one archive is bigger than second of the same car, for ex: first got about 46MB and second about 6MB, and both got the same files. Maybe model LOD's???
I hope for some reply and maybe a script for Quickbms or something else.

Yeah,
i playing this game for 2 days now and has some great car models and textures and looking forward for someone to "crack" those .arc files.
I tried it already with FreeARC. No success, of course.

I ripped some cars but there are problems with materials, I mean it's impossible to separate chrome from plastic on one part e.g: bumper.
Also smoothing is fucked up on some parts.
Thats why I'm looking for script for 3D max or quickbms or any help with open cars.
