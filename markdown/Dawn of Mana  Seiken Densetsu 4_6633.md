Hello, I've been trying to work out this model format for the past day or two, and I'm stuck. This is my first attempt at extracting models from a game, but I managed to open the DATA.BIN file on the DVD and extract all of the files inside. It took a while to find the files that I believe to contain mesh information, but I think I've finally found it. The files have an .ALL extension and the first four bytes are ( 0x35 0x39 0x36 0x0D ). These files seem to contain joints and textures, and hopefully vertex, uv and weight information. The problem I have is that I can not seem to find the kind of structure they used to store this information. I've included 4 examples in a zip file, as well as html pages that can be accessed directly. I can upload more on request if needed. Below is the structure that I've been through so far. Hopefully most of it is correct. Sorry if the structure definition is a bit weird, I've never done this before. 

Solved. Links Offline.

Any help would be greatly appreciated. I look forward to any replies.
