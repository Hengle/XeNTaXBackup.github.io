- Post Title: FEE 3D Models

Is there any place in which people are currently ripping the 3D models from Fire Emblem Engage? I would like to be able to help formatting these models and eventually start using them. I am just having a lot of trouble trying to get the game files to rip the models myself. Or even just if someone could paste in the folders for character models/textures, because I can do the rest from there.

you can rip them directly with asset studio but the textures are unusable

they're just swizzled

there's a few solutions around that; sciresm did a version of unity asset studio that can open them:
