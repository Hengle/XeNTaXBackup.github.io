- Post Title: Txx Format Within Virtual Jenna

So for awhile now Ive been on the search and looking everywhere on info and tools to
modify the .txx format which is the main format used in Virtual Jenna that they created
to used on the game's textures on the content.

I know theres been Mod bundles that were created by a person named Oxin or 'Oxin's
Style!' which is the .txx files that were modified but I really cant find out anything more
then that.

One thing I saw when I was in the search was a program called FreeCoder and of course
I looked everywhere for that and couldnt find one.

Id like to make custom textures myself to add into the game is the reason why. I guess the
last thing I should say is when someone modifies a format do they usually have to work in
codes to enter the new modified textures or is there other ways (hoping I worded that right
heh)

I dont even know if theres a program that can extract the contents from this file but it 
would be nice to find one. Id appreciate any help, thanks for reading this
