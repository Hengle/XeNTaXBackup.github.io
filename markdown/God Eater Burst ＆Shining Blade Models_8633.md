Shining Blade
MLX is container files, model[HMDL], texture[HTSF]
It looks like HMDL format is about the same for Valkyria Chronicles.

As mentioned, you can run gitmo (the link still works above) for God Eater Burst. It doesn't really matter since the files in the RDP only have hashes to represent them, so you won't be getting original filenames either way. You can run gitmo on the iso or the rdp. Noesis views the GMO and GIM files extracted by gitmo.

to me with some GMO models when opened noesis crashed, and JPCSP that can decrypt PGD or check from de dump memory in debbuger   mode, i don't know if the raw files of the models can be extracted in t pose from here

Use the most recent version of Noesis. If it still crashes, submit the crash when it asks.
