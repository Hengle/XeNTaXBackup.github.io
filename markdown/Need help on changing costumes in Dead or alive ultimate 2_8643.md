- Post Title: Need help on changing costumes in Dead or alive ultimate 2

Simply put, I managed to use some of the tools to view the costumes, but when i simply switch the names of the costumes, the game freezes and crashes.

From the original guide I looked at the guide Green Ranger put out for modding the game files for Dream cast, you're supposed to mod the files through a hex editor.

Since all I wanted to do was switch costumes, i thought it would be easy.  Can't seem to do it though.

here is the main link with the link for swapping costumes is down at the bottom.  Can someone help me by making sense of this?


EDIT:
sorry for not making this clear, but I have a modded xbox, not a dreamcast so instead of a .bin file what I have is datahdd2.afs which has all of the models and textures located within the file.
