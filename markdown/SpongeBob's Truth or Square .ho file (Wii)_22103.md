- Post Title: SpongeBob's Truth or Square *.ho file (Wii)

Hello, I am currently working on trying to extract these ho files from SpongeBob's Truth or Square for the Wii. It is made by Heavy Iron Studios, and the format from what we've found is similar to SpongeBob SquarePants: Battle for Bikini Bottom's *.HIP and *.HOP files, but is a little more complex. Any help in getting these to extract wold make my year!   

Here is a link to a sample *.ho file from the game: [https://drive.google.com/file/d/19kqphu ... sp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/19kqphukEocbAdSd-5KWP-ARz3IUhn8vH/view?usp=sharing)

Please help if you can, and if you can, thank you so much!

Thank you for being the first to reply, and yes, I will try to put more effort into this kind of stuff to get noticed in the future. 

Is there any way you or someone could help me write a QuickBMS script for this format? I have already tried QuickBMS guides and cannot grasp still what to write in my script. Like I mentioned, these *.ho files are very similar to "SpongeBob SquarePants: Battle for Bikini Bottom's" *.HIP and *.HOP files, and the hip/hop files were fully cracked, so I hope these can be too easily. I have also tried modifying the HIP/HOP script to match the *.ho format, and a link if anyone can help correcting it or telling me how to correct it.[https://drive.google.com/file/d/1oKa21H ... sp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1oKa21H6HLfWkXqGQje61qVGeuQOFgVXk/view?usp=sharing)

And thanks for helping who all that replies!

[https://battlepedia.org/HIP_(File_Format)](https://battlepedia.org/HIP_%28File_Format%29)
for example and an attempt (at least) to compare ho and HIP/HOP formats.

I know they are similar because the BFBB Modding community server i'm part of looked at them and found many similarities. Im sorry im just new to reverse engineering and hope I am not coming off as annoying.

Okay, what's that map called in the game? Also I am looking for the outfit of Spongebob with a Krusty Krab hat, which is my favorite outfit of Spongebob in TOS for Wii and XBox 360.

My main was banned and now I've apologized so please don't lie and this isn't a joke.
