- Post Title: Darksiders 2 .wpc

So I have been rooting through Darksiders 2 downloading unpackers left and right, and I finally got into pesky .upaks in the media folder. Problem is, the sound archive I want to crack into SFX_Character_Despair.wpc is an obscure word processing file that opens gibberish up in Word Pad. Is there a way to unpack a wpc file, or is there a way to convert it into another type of archive and then extract from there? I have searched all over google and only managed to come up with tutorials on how to convert it to some sort of scrapbooking file to print out images.

Its a renamed bnk file.
Changing the extention to .bnk then using any of the wwise bnk tools works.
