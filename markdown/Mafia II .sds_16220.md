- Post Title: Mafia II .sds

Hello ! 

I have tried to extract audio from Mafia II by using ExSDS, but when it extracted .sds files, it gave me only non-playable .Sound files. I don't know how to play it, and I really want those files. I also precise it's not music I want, but voices. If someone could help me, it'll be very nice. 

Thanks.

PS: Please excuse my bad english, I'm not a native speaker.
