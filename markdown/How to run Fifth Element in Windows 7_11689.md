If you ever wanted to install and run The Fifth Element (1998) on Windows 7, then do the following. 
 Option 1. Copy the content of [E082-008soda](http://www.xentax.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/E082-008soda.zip)to the installation folder of T5E.
 Option 2. Add the parameter -D3D to the start-up of the game (using a new short-cut).
 Then change the name of dbghelp.dll in C:\WINDOWS \system32, AND in C:\WINDOWS\SysWOW64 (if you have x64). You can change it to anything other, just make sure the game canâ€™t find it. Thanks to RUTracker.

Awesome! Love seeing support for older titles on newer OS. There's nothing sadder than trying to boot up an old nostalgic favourite from you childhood and realising it speaks a different language to all the newfangled techno-boop wizardry of the modern age. xD
