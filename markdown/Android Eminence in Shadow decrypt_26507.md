Hi, I want to get the text files for the story of the game and character info but I'm not being able to do that, I tried with Asset ripper and Asset Studio but it is imposible, I think I identified the story text but looks like notepad picture above and the other picture is the console of Asset Ripper, that I think the program is not exporting the character files

With the il2cpp dumper I made dummy dll and some other files if they are useful for that because a lot of the game directories are different from the tutorials I saw but now I can't do what to do now

have you tried using this cracked version of DevX to extract it?

I didn't know about that, do you think it will be useful to get that files? I already found a working way to get them but it's a bit hard for people who doesn't know about programming, so if this will be more easy I'll go all in with it
