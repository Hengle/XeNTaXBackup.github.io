Never heard of "ABCD". Do a forum search for "lithtech", then search for "ABC" in the results. Without the quotes.

Where do you have the info from about said tool? What are its features?
Probably you mean ModelEdit? It's included in the zip in this post (click on up arrow):

ok, a decompiler. (mind to be somewhat more specific?  )

Guess, you mean decompiling to lta.Which is the input file then? Guess: ltb? Or .abc?

edit: well, now I understand, finally.    "ABCD" that means .ABC decompiler.

btw: a possible workaround might be using .ltb as input:
googling "ltb to lta converter" I had some hits ("Model_Unpacker", mpgh.net).

So the ABCD tool should be in the AVP2 mod tools pack, shouldn't it?
(can't seem to find an ABC->lta decompiler in them)
