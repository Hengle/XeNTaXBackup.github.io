- Post Title: .bank audio files from celeste custom mods zip

Hello!
I am trying to extract .bank files from a zip of celeste custom mods audio. I have used the tools that convert .bank to .fsb and fsb to ogg, I even get the audio files names correct, but if i play the ogg file, it says file maybe corrupted and can't play  . The zip also contained a GUIDs file, so i thought i could use FMOD studio to open it, but failed in opening a bank file as fmod seems to open only a .fsmod project file , which contains .xml files in the project's bank folder. So i am stuck, don't know how to extract the audio , Any Help would be Great for me as i Love the music but can't find it downloadable after extensive search online. Can someone HELP me please? THANKS

I have linked a zip containing the bank file and guids file(idk if guids file is useful, but anyway).

If you use my attached QuickBMS script to extract the FSB file, you can then drop that extracted FSB file straight into Foobar and vgmstream can play/convert the files as required.

Sorry for disturbing you but I am extremely new here, and I don't know how to get started. Which software should I use to run .bms file? Is it vgmtoolbox? If yes where should I copy the bms file? Please post a detailed solution/steps , I am an ultranoob. And what software should I use to convert the final fsb to audio... Thank you!!

Edit: ok I downloaded quickBMS and ran your .bms file and .bank file,(did I do it right?). I got a .fsb. Used the fsbext , still the corrupted message shows up, I didn't get the foobar and vgmstream part. Thanks

Firstly, download QuickBMS: [http://aluigi.altervista.org/quickbms.htm](http://aluigi.altervista.org/quickbms.htm) - save my bms script somewhere you'll remember.  I usually put them in the same folder as the data file to be extracted.

If you run QuickBMS from the exe, it'll ask you to select the script, then the file (bgm.dat), then an output folder - you should then end up with 1 .fsb file in your output folder.

You'll also need Foobar: [https://www.foobar2000.org/](https://www.foobar2000.org/) and the vgmstream plugin: [https://www.foobar2000.org/components/v ... _vgmstream](https://www.foobar2000.org/components/view/foo_input_vgmstream)

Once you've got those installed, you can just drop the .fsb file onto Foobar to play them.  You can then convert them to various formats by selecting the ones you want to convert and right-clicking and selecting Convert.
