- Post Title: Request: re-rip of LOTR the Third Age audio?

I've been checking out the audio of the Third Age game, but in existing rips the tempo is all wrong. Since the ost of the game is largely remixes of Howard Shore, I'd wonder if someone could re-rip it. It was also out on XBOX and Gamecube, if it helps.

Pretty please? Audio and SFXs?

Game was released on PlayStation 2, Xbox, Nintendo GameCube.

To anybody looking to extract the audio from this game, you can do this on the PS2 ISO! You need to extract the modules/data from the game using any old PS2 ISO extractor, I used Apache3, and then you need can use "ADPCM Player v1.44h" to scan the .SAS files and it will pull out all of the SFX, Music and Dialogue (which isn't individual files but rather single files for each cutscene).

These are all in stereo so on ADPCM you will need to set the interleave to 8000, set the frequency to 48000 and set the number of channels to 2. These settings work for most things, but you may need to tweak things a little for some music (some of these are at a different frequency) and possibly group audio.

This eluded me for years so I hope it is of some use to others!

Cheers,
