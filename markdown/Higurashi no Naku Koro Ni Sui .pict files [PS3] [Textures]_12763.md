- Post Title: Higurashi no Naku Koro Ni Sui .pict files [PS3] [Textures]

Hello! Could anyone take a look at this .pict file? It's a CG Scene[?] from Higurashi no Naku Koro Ni Sui (PS3 game)
I've looked around for programs / looked at the data in a hex editor, but there seems to be no "distinguishible" artifacts.
Thanks!

Upload this somewhere that we can actually access it.

Didn't even notice the settings I had put on there, sorry.

Fixed.
