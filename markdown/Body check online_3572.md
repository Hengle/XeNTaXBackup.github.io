True, true...still, I have extremely limited bandwidth so I would like to know that before DL'ing a game...also, hoping an English version since the game looks interesting...

It works good for the most part there are only about 4 models in this game but there are some different parts you can interchange to make it more unique but that is about it.

I love how the password is in plain text right after it says dat in the archive its perfect

This reminds me, I hope the files aren't royally screwed up like Neo Steam, or else we might not get an update in a VERY long time for the Nif tools...
