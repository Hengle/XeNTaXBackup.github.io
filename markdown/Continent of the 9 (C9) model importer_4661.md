Thank You,

Can these import scripts work in newer 2.5 versions of blender?

Also, this game   Mabinogi Heroes [http://heroes.nexon.com/](http://heroes.nexon.com/)   has state of the art character models is there any chance you can take look and see if it's a candidate for model extraction and import into to blender?

You can google video search "Character Creation mabinogi heroes" to find a few different videos showing the characters if your interested.


P.S. Your python skills are awesome, Please keep posting

mabinoji heroes will be easy once someone cracks the ice encryption the files have on them.
they are source engine models so tons of importers already exist.

Hi, Thanks for the awesome script. I'm getting python error when I try to utilize your c9.blend script. I'm getting an error on the first line that reads:

import bpy,struct,os

Do you have any idea what I'm doing wrong? Also, I'm using the specified version of Blender and have placed everything according to instructions. Thanks in advance.

Good job man, maybe you can include a guide how to extract this files from the packed files of the game. .csf or .hfs i  think.

Bones are not damaged. They have only bad look. The head of each bone is correct. 
I checked "kirimu" model and all animation are good.
Please send screen from console.
