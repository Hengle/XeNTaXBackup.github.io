- Post Title: MLB 09 The Show PS3 .WAD File

Hey guys, new here so I apologize if this is the wrong section. I'm looking to see if there's anyone who can extract a PS3 .WAD file from MLB 09 The Show. I'm mainly looking to see if any models/textures/dds files can be pulled. I've tried messing around with the God of War WAD extractors/scripts for BMS with no such luck. Hopefully someone with more knowledge and experience could be able to make some progress on this. Thanks!

I don't think anyone will download 11 GB just to look at a file!

It's probably best if you just extract a small part of it - maybe the first 10 MB or so, and upload that instead.
