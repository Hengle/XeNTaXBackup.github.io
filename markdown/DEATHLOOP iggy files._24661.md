- Post Title: DEATHLOOP iggy files.

Hi, I'm translating Deathloop to my native language. I solved nearly all my problems thanks to Zenhax and Xentax. I have a little problem left, I made a post in Zenhax forum for iggy files. Thanks to "Zenhax - cockafej", he found a way to edit the iggy files. But it does not seem to work while trying to edit. We need a little help, thanks.
