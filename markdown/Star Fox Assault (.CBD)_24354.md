- Post Title: Star Fox Assault (.CBD)

Hello!

I've recently been taking a look at extracting models from Star Fox Assault. After spending hours searching online, there seems to be no information on the model files, let alone extracting from the game. I was wondering if there is anyone who would be willing to help me with this   

From what I can tell, the models are in the /SE/ folder of the game. There are 3 file types associated with each character, .C3D, .CHD, and .CBD. Although the only one that seems to matter is the .CBD file. Some samples can be downloaded here:

Thank you for reading, hopefully we can figure this out

Don't know if I'm blind but I don't think I can see any faces info inside the .cbd file, I only skimmed it over through.

Is anyone in 2023 willing to take a look into this? I found another forum on a different site where someone else looked through the files and confirmed that the CBD files are indeed the models

.CBD looks compressed to me. Or encrypted, dunno.

The small .C3D files (C3D in the header) are different but too small to contain useful data, imho.
