Hello guys, I'm new here. I want translate Nier Automata with my friends in our language but we have some problems. For now I saw some subtitles in data002.cpk or data100.cpk, well I even extract this files with quickbms and i have now .dat files but dunno what to do with them. I search in google many diffrent methods how to extract them but no one work ;< Can someone give me some advice?

text tools: [https://github.com/marcussacana/AutomataTranslator](https://github.com/marcussacana/AutomataTranslator) 
extract/repack: [http://www.mediafire.com/file/op28t19b9 ... _Stuff.rar](http://www.mediafire.com/file/op28t19b91ot4j7/Nier_Stuff.rar)

just missing a MCD editor, I don't have one with me.

in the DAT directory have some .bats, you need edit to match your directory

open the Dump.bat to extract all .dat in the directory
drop a extracted directory to the "pack as single dat.bat" to repack a extracted .dat
the repack is a shortcut to repack all cutscene subtitle .dat's
