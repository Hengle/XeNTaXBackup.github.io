- Post Title: How edit text in GameObject?

I want to translate "Forgotten Memories" into my language, but the game dialogs stay in the "level1" file, when extracted, it has the files"GameObject".
How to translate texts in these GameObject formats?

The files that you have attached don't contain any text.
Dialogs must be somewhere else.

Has yes, I used unitytext to see the texts, but I can't edit them through unitytext, because of the black screen in the game, due to other files on "level1".
