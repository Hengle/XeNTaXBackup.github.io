- Post Title: Acade America (Very old)

I need help for the Acade America game file format. The game was made in 1996 and contains .BIN files for the data, images sounds and music.
I didn't find any tools for this file format.

The files: (GERMAN VERSION, I don't have the English one)
(I think this is abadonware, the company doesn't even exists anymore)

Archive format: 7LB (7th level bin?)

It would be nice if someone can do something for this old lady.

Greetings
