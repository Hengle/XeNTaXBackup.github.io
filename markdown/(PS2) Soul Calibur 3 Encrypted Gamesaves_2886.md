- Post Title: (PS2) Soul Calibur 3 Encrypted Gamesaves

For current work on this game, please see the Soul Calibur 3 megathread.

I was playing with SC3 and I was going to mess with the game save to see what I could change but it seems encrypted as I couldn't find anything even remotely similar to the data I entered in. I couldn't find even any text I recognize. Somewhere in there was supposed to be text saying "Tamamo" but I couldn't find it and since it can compress further it doesn't seem to be a compression. I know this is a longshot but anything found out would be useful.

i don't know any good ps2 debugger out there, so it's hard to get the algorithm out of the executable. You may try to disassemble the exe, with some luck you find something.
