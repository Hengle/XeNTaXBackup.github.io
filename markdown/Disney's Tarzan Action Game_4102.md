- Post Title: Disney's Tarzan Action Game

Hi there,

it's not a request, but I wanted to share this with you.
I just found my old Tarzan action game again.
I had a look at the game's files and found out, that it's very easy to get the music although there are no .wav or big enough files and so on.
Just insert the CD into your drive, open up a program like "Exact Audio Copy" or any other ripping program, et voil√†, you can just rip the music to whatever format you like.
There are 20 tracks with a duration of 36m 13s in total.
