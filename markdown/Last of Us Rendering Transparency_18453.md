- Post Title: Last of Us Rendering Transparency

Hey guys,

So been ripping The Last of Us Remastered models, and I'm having a bit of trouble on rendering this one properly. I have absolutely no clue on how to apply transparency maps to the eyelashes, eye overlay, and hair on ellie's model. Could anyone teach me how to render these transparency (the black and white) textures properly? I have both Cinema 4D and blender, so either or would be great. Thanks so much in advance to anyone who offers me any piece of advice . Model link attached below

Nevermind folks, figured out the needed combination to make the alpha appear properly
