Hello. I was having trouble trying to play this game on PC using microsoft xbox360 pad.
The problem is that the names of the buttons in game are named like "Button1, Button2" etc.
I was wandering if I can change these values. I found two files which may contain the text of the game.
They have .scw extension. Is there any way to read/change them? I'm absolutely new to translating games.
These are the two files: [http://www.speedyshare.com/pSEee/Data.rar](http://www.speedyshare.com/pSEee/Data.rar)

I downloaded "Game Extractor" tool where it says it supports .scw files but I dont know what to do with it.
