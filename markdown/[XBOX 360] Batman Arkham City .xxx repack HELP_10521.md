Could some one please help me with repacking .xxx files for Batman Arkham City. I have extracted the files using Gildor's umodel a.k.a unreal model viewer. Anyways what I want to do is switch one of the DLC files with the original model for, and then just change the skin. So basically I want to replace the earth one batman and the animated batman skins with new skins that I made which are from the movies the Dark Knight rises and the Batman Begins movies. But since the models are also differnet hence I would have to replace the models as well. So I have done it all but I need help with importing the new textures and model files in the the .xxx files and repacking the .xxx files. AND YES I HAVE MANAGED TO EXTRACT THE .xxx FILES FROM THE DLC CONTENT FILES USING WXPIRS 360

Basically it's impossible.
Because there are lots of export and import offset you need to change.You need good programming skills and lots of time.
