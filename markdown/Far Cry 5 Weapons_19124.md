- Post Title: Far Cry 5 Weapons

Hello 

because the viewmodel FOV is not high enough for my taste, i would like to mod it for the weapons in the game.
I unpacked that dat/fat files and located the entityarchetypeslibrary. In Far Cry 4 thats where all the weapons were to be found. 
Now i've got around 4000 files here and i got no clue how to find the weapons among them.

Help would be really appreciated.

Thanks in advance and have a nice day
