- Post Title: How do I extract stage PAK files for Killer Instinct?

I've tried using the ki.bms script to unpack it but I get this error

"Error: the requested amount of bytes to allocate is negative (0X081da60d5)
last script line before the error or that produced the error:
18  getdstring NVAR NSIZE"
