i think your threads should not be in tutorials because there is no tutorial in them   

you can open your sample with "Unity Asset Bundle Extractor" and extract the file from your sample which is just one wav audio clip.

Hi James82 I have moved your topic to the correct sub-forum. Please do not post under the tutorial section unless it is a thread providing a tutorial.

Cheers.
