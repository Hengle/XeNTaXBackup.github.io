- Post Title: Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen (PS3) - How to convert .str files?

Hey guys! So I have some files from a DLC of the Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen video game on PlayStation 3. The files are in ".str" file formats, and I was wondering if anybody here can help me get the models and textures from these? If so, please let me know! I have linked a zip file below containing the files.

Also, is there any way to make convert them to be compatible with the PC version's .str files?
