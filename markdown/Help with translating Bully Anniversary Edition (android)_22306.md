Maybe code from this post can be helpful --> [viewtopic.php?t=15777](https://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?t=15777)


Edit: I have checked it and it works, but main function must be adjusted. Compile it in Dev-C++.

Yes, I have converted source to C++, added some comments and did some refactoring,
but that's all for now.

Here you can see the result

Yeah, I was able to make some changes in encode function (check my github), but it is not enough to make it work. It may be just too hard for me right now. And I hope that someone else will be able to finish it.
