and used the bms script to extract the .dat files and it looks like it worked

do you mean the scripts that was on the forum or do you mean the scripts on the site [http://aluigi.altervista.org/](http://aluigi.altervista.org/)
if the forum i already tried the scripts except the script to split .sat samples

and if you mean the site then could you post download link cause the site is very hard to navigate ...atleast for me .
