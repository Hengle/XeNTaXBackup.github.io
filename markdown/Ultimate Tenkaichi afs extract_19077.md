- Post Title: Ultimate Tenkaichi afs extract

hey guys.
i need to extract the model from Dragonball Z Ultimate Tenkaichi.
i tried using the same way as to extract Raging Blast 2 Models but noesis just crashes.
If someone could make a noesis plugin for that game would be highly apreciated.
Hers the .afs file if someone wants to take a look.

Hi,
you wouldn't expect someone to download a 650 MB file just for one sample, do you?  
(Or is it one big afs file?)

Maybe try this AFSExplorer?

its one big .afs file which contains all the characters. just like in raging blast 2

using afsexplorer can extract a bunch of battle files.
extracting the rb2 afs with afs explorer gives me also a bunch of battle files.
i looked trough them with a hex editor and found the .spr for gokus files in both games.
they look pretty similar to me. i guess the decryption is different.
Ultimate Tenkaichi:

Raginb Blast 2:


i tried to contact the creator of the rb2 plugiin which is [memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&u=4713](http://forum.xentax.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&u=4713) but he doesnt seem to be very active theese days

If you look at the two pictures, the headers are different. The RB2 sample posted, under STPZ shows 0DCS and 0LCS, while the UT file provided shows SCD0 and SCL0.

No idea on how to write the tool for that though.
