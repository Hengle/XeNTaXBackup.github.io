Some pretty exciting stuff!

What if you set up a forum on here where you started a new thread for each frontpage item, so people could comment on them? You would link to the thread from the main item with a note that people could go there to comment on it, and then in the thread, duplicate the item in the first post (plus maybe put a link back to the original item). What do you think?

What do you think?I think that's a neat idea, seeing how we don't use the comments feature of WordPress very much. People can always just post, though...

True, but if we give them a specific place to comment on stuff, they'll be more apt to say something than if we leave it up to them to visit the forum, try to figure out the best place to post, and then start a thread - not to mention the unlikelihood of them looking for existing threads before starting a new one...

Problem is, I've disabled comments there because of the damn spam. . .

That's another benefit of doing this on the forum, there'll be more eyes to keep an eye out for spam and report/remove it if it pops up (I was aware of the problem before, BTW  ), and it'll also benefit from any anti-spam measures you might've installed on the forum.

I'm still gunning for a front page updates comment forum... I'll even go so far as to create comment threads for all current updates + linking to them from the front page (assuming I have sufficient privileges) if you just set the forum up, Mr.Mouse...

Basically what I suggested above - a Frontpage Item Discussion forum where each item has its own discussion thread, with the item being repeated in the first post, and the thread being linked from the actual frontpage item. We can then review all current comments on the front page, deleting everything that's spam, and where there are posts worth keeping, add a note about prior posts in the respective threads. After that, disable comments on the front page to keep all discussion on-wiki. Guests should be able to post to the actual forum, IMHO; spam can be very effectively controlled via the use of reCAPTCHA.
