- Post Title: Sheep Raider .MLT file (PS1)

Could someone check the file to see if there is any way, tool or script to extract or edit the texts and then re-import the new texts for the archive?

About the texts in the MLT file, there appears to be a checksum and it is not possible to modify any character via hex editor, as the game does not work.

I also don't know if the MLT depends on some other file to make the checksum.

Here are some levels in different folders with all files included 'not just MLT'

Thanks.
