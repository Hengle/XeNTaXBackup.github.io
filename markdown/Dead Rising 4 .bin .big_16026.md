Same engine as Dead Rising 3, Forge Engine, but probably different encoding.

For the *.big:

first longlong - null
arksize long
filecount long
null long (don't know)
headersize long
||DataStarts||
first fname pointer.
Each entry is 0x1c in length


and that's all i could find. It looks compressed on some basis, but I don't know.

Hello Sir Kane!
Me and the community of [http://deadrising2mods.proboards.com/](http://deadrising2mods.proboards.com/) would like to gift you a Steam copy of Dead Rising 4 + Season Pass (Contains all DLC including the new Frank Rising) with the ulterior motives of helping us, the modding community for DR4! We also realize that we are asking a lot for your help in cracking files like .bin, .big, and what else you might stumble on inside the game's coding and for that I apologize and thank you. As passionate fans, our wish is to take something great and making it better and the key lies inside the game's files. I'd love to get you in touch with someone who is already ready to gift it to your Steam account! Which brings me to the big question, can you share your Steam account name for me. 

Also I hope you create an account with us there for the sake of showing us any progress you may find. A lot of fellow passionate people like myself are around every corner. No ones going to hard ass you into working too hard and tell you what to do.
I hope you enjoy the game once you've installed everything! Have a great day dude!
