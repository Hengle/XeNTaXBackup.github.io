Hello. The game is Cabela's 4x4 Off-Road Adventure (FUN labs, 2001).
I need to be able to repack this game's archives for my modifications.
One person has helped me and created the script for QuickBMS.

But the thing is that I must be able to repack the files with bigger size to these archives. It is needed for my modifications. QuickBMS does not allow to do this.

Not relevant anymore.

Yeah, I did this a month ago.

I'm talking about this. So I need another way.
