- Post Title: DMC4/5 animations for UMVC3 Nero Mod

Hi, I'm working on this Ultimate Marvel vs Capcom 3 mod, featured by Maximilian

The UMvC3 modding scene might be on the verge of allowing custom animations. Do we have a documented way of extracting animations from DMC4 and/or DMC5? As long as we can port them to Blender, it would work for us.
