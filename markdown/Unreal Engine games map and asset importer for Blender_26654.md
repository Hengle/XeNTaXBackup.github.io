- Post Title: Unreal Engine games map and asset importer for Blender

Hello,
I developed a Blender addon which is capable of importing models, materials and maps from most Unreal Engine 4 games. It depends on UModel (UEViewer) and FModel. It also has a specific "games profile" feature which allows creating game-specific importer tweaks easily with simple scrripts. For example, it currently has dedicated special support for extracting assets from Hogwarts Legacy.
