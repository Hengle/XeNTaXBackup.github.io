- Post Title: Amnesia The Dark Descent Renderer#0 error on Intel HDGraphic

Hello, I want to ask you if it is possible to make a fix for the game, "Amnesia - The dark descent" to run on the Intel HD Graphics. I am pretty sure that this game does not require high end graphics, but the game programmer did not want to make the game supported to Intel HD Graphics, so we have to fix this.

The game i can run on Intel(R) HD Graphics without any problem(Lagging, Crashing) are - Far Cry2, Stalker - Clear Sky, Rainbow6 Vegas2, Resident Evil5. IGI, IGI2, Dark Sector, Prince of Persia - The Forgotten sands (and all parts), Left4Dead2, Street Fighter4 etc, Call of Duty: Black ops.

As the game i described above required 256 MB Graphics or more and was not supported to Intel HD Graphics in the PC Requirement, i could even successfully run on Intel(R) HD Graphics.

The game i was unable to run after every possible fix: Need for Speed: Shift, Silent Hill: Shattered Memories, Amnesia - The dark Descent

So, My request is to make a fix in the Amnesia.exe to make it support Intel HD Graphics. I know its possible and you guys can do that.

Here is what i tried:
1. Installed Amnesia - The dark descent to C:\
2. Updated to Amnesia 1.01 (The latest patch available)
3. Entered Serial 11111111111111
4. Did Random Settings (LOw, Medium, High) but can not run.
5. When launched the game i get error "FATAL ERROR: Renderer #0 could not be initialized! Make sure Your graphic card drivers are up to date. Check log file for more information"

Thank you Dinoguy1000, Rahly


Here is the log file details (Sorry could not attach it , because i get error (log file extension is not allowed)

buy a cheap gfx card Intel cards suck and you would get low fps even if it were possible to get ti to run you can buy a better card for under 40 dollars.
And this is a game research forum not hack a game to run on old unsupported hardware.

Rude, surly and still missed the point as to what chroxx said.

Sorry, but I don't think you're going to find many people who are going to recompile the HLSL/GLSL shaders from scratch only to get a game to work on a VGA that supports at best SH1.1, even if they did, what's the point? The sheer amount of vertices in the game will overflow the Buffer RAM in the VGA, plus the game wouldn't be dark anymore, and the light dynamic lights wouldn't work...half of the game is about shadows and lights (as well physics).

The games isn't that beefy, meaning if you can't put in 30 bucks to buy a last generation VGA, then there is no point in playing, because as chroxx said already, "you would get low fps even if it were possible to get it to run" which is not.

Also "And this is a game research forum not hack a game to run on old unsupported hardware."
