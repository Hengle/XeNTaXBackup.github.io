- Post Title: Final Fantasy - 4 Heroes of Light Models/Animations/Textures

I am trying to get these resources from Final Fantasy and into Blender or Noesis but I don't really know how. In Every FIle Explorer I can dump what appears to be these files. A quick decompress w/ gbalzss seems to work but IDK what to do next.
