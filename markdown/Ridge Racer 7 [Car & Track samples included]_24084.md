So, as the RR7 internal archives can now be dumped, I was curious if there's anyone who can make a script to convert or import them. The main folder has over 2000 files, and an ungodly amount of models, so a quick way to convert them all would be rather nice. Sample of a car and track below.


[https://we.tl/t-38cK0GCmTh](https://we.tl/t-38cK0GCmTh)  ~ Bisonte Select, (probably) menu select models. G1(normal / reverse), a track!

Both are behind one link now, old one expired.

45 to 80 parts assumed to be in a mdl file, so yeah, a script would be nice.

That looks cool, I'm no good with converting via hex. But yeah, part of why I'm wanting a script or some way to easily convert them is the game has like, 40 cars and a bunch with variations like that. And this doesn't even start to look at the tracks, which is a whole other story.

Make H2O can do multiple submeshes at once?

You might try out these H2O files (for Mdl file in folder b_0, Bisonte) with hex2obj's File/SaveAs Mmesh feature (with the Mdl file loaded, of course):
(it reads "Mmesh", not "mesh")

Haha I'm ready for everything trust me.
I'll give it a shot and explore how h2o works in general, never tried using it before but looks like a pretty awesome tool overall.

There's an unpacker that exists for the RR series now. Sort of a 'finally!' thing.

So, I should update.

This exists. Drag your MDL onto the program, and it spits a bunch of OBJs out, import those and you have your car. Doesn't work with tracks, unfortunately.

is there a way to make the dump? I have the R Racing Evo and the RR7 iso files, but the first one, the unpacker seems to not respond to me, do I need an extra part or a VS 201x version?

No? I just extracted RGC.DAT from R:Racing to test if it was working or not. So either you aren't following the instructions, or are doing something wrong. The GitHub says which version of the game the extractor uses.

Are you following the directions exactly, it's usually easier if the prereq files are in the same folder, makes the actual unpacking easier, like R Racing for example..

RRUnpacker.exe rre -i RGC.DAT -e SLES_523.09 -o ps2_output

That would make a new folder named ps2_output and export the DAT for R Racing there.

Yes I do, I read every step, and that's what occurs, sometimes is deleted by the antivirus, okay, I restore it and make the folder an exception, or then what happens is that the cmd window pops and cloese, or in some cases shows me the first line before closing, one time I had the chance to see the options but didn't give me a chance to react because as always it closes it

Guess you should start the exe file in a command line window (that remains open then still you close it manually).

First of all learn and understand how to decrypt the eboot to get the main.self or making the file an ELF, from there I guess some posts above are the clues to know how to move around the unpacker, and for everyone else thank you, now I have to learn how to extract the contents from the RRE contents now that has been unpacked.

Update managed to make it run, and now I'm unpacking every Track, Cutscene and Car, now about to check the MDL-R7O

I wrote this string:
RRUnpacker.exe rr7 -i RR7.DAT -e eboot.bin -g NPUB30457 -o Nuovacartella

The output was this:

The R7O splitter would have to be updated, models are similar but not the same, but I can't program and I don't think that program will be updated, so it's probably going to be a while unless someone forks it and wants to update it

Read closely what the tool supports, game version, region, etc, then see if you indeed used correct syntax, if you did everything correct, then I'd suggest to create a new issue so the dev can be aware of it, where you explain your full steps on how you get the error and post the error too:

I'm using latest version of RRUnpacker, then my Ridge Racer 7 game version is NPUB30457 US region. I had the game that supports the tool I was about to extract. I didn't created the new issue but rather I replied in the first issue created on 5th Dec, 2021.

EDIT: nvm it worked with help from someone else.

"RRUnpacker.exe rr7 -i RR7.DAT -e eboot.elf -g NPUB30457 -o Nuovacartella
RRUnpacker for Ridge Racer PSP(V2)/6/7/PSVita & R:Racing Evolution - by Nenkai#9075

Provided ELF file 'eboot.elf' does not exist."

This is what I get, obviously because that file is a .bin file and I can't find a way to convert the main.self in main.elf...

This bit, right here. 
I've been trying to decrypt both RR7 and RRPSP for nearly a full week straight and no matter what I do, I ALWAYS get this message. I have a decrypted EBOOT.bin for the RR7 one. I have a decrypted UCES00422.BIN from PPSSPP for the RRPSP one. No matter what, I get this.

I swear, the total absence of any meaningful tutorial or guide on how to use RRUnpacker is hair-pullingly frustrating to me. As someone who relies heavily upon manuals/tutorials/instructions/etc. when learning to use new tools, the lack of documentation here is heartbreaking. I so desperately just want to extract the damn car models from RR7 and RRPSP, and I've been trying to follow everything in this forum to the letter and it's all been FOR NOTHING. I'm at my wit's end, here. PLEASE, someone explain in clear, detailed terms exactly what the COMPLETE, CORRECT process is for A) setting up/decrypting the data necessary for the program to run, and B) the exact syntax needed to do so. I am literally begging here. I'm trying to so hard to do it right, but this 3-page forum is the only documentation that exists anywhere online as far as I can tell, and it's just not enough.

P.S. Does anyone just like, HAVE the correct .bin and .elf files needed, and would be willing to upload them? Or even a Mega link to the extracted .mdl files? Honestly any of that would work too, just ... ugh. PLEASE help me.

UPDATE: Okay, so here is what has happened since my initial post (in detail for the sake of anyone else who has this problem in the future:)

1. After getting "the specified .ELF file does not exist" for ages, I re-entered the syntax for it to specifically include the COMPLETE FILEPATH for the .elf file, so the end result looked like this:

> C:\Users\[me]>C:\Users\[me]\Desktop\RRUnpacker\RRUnpacker.exe rr7 -i "C:\Users\[me]\Desktop\RRUnpacker\RR7.DAT" -e "C:\Users\[me]\Desktop\RRUnpacker\EBOOT.bin" -g NPUB30457 -o C:\Users\[me]\Desktop\RRUnpacker\RR7-Ext
2. This finally seemed to prevent the "__ Does not exist" problem and instead lead me to THIS one:

> Unhandled exception. System.IO.EndOfStreamException: Could not read 4 bytes.

>
>    at RRUnpacker.Program.Main(String[] args)
3. Having checked the other replies in this thread once again, I see that someone else had this exact same issue and posted about it on the RRUnpacker GitHub page. I checked said post, and saw that no one had replied to it. Said person also said they "fixed it with help from someone else" but then didn't bother to elaborate as to what they did to actually fix it. frustration.png

If anyone knows the fix to this, PLEASE let me know. Once this utter hell is finally over, I swear to all of you: I will take it upon myself to create and post a super-detailed, comprehensive guide to the entire process on this forum page, so no one ever has to suffer the way I've done ever again.

You missed the whole point, you should have said something like, "hey guys i got helped from else where, this is what worked for me, maybe it will work for someone with similar experience" then you go ahead and post the steps you performed to actually help someone in need too, right?
Posting a message that you did get helped after all, yet not how and what worked for you so others can use that and maybe it may work for them should have been the right post, not what you posted, does that make better sense now? You replied twice already, unproductively, think about it, my humble opinion.

Well. I've been playing with the game and using renderdoc for the textures,theres another program, but sounds more tedious to me, and more as I "completed" the game, also what you had selected is actually the set refering to the Arkbird parts rather than the piece itself

you didn't see the image clearly, I meant the material itself of why they're also not imported to each parts after I import them to Blender scene, not the part name. I've checked it and every parts were all blank/no material linked with it. and it's really tedious to create new one and assign to different one.

if anyone can update the blender plugin, pls lmk

I got what they meant, A0X courses are the ones related to Lakeshore Drive, and surroundings, the CGN map you shared is the CarGet01- which bases on car order, is for the Kamata Fiera. Explore through a blender plugin, also spoiler some items might get "lost in translation" (exploded and all made up a mess)

Oh I see, it's for the car aquire scene, alright thx for clarifying. 

> Explore through a blender plugin
There was a blender plugin but way unfinished and doesn't work for Ridge Racer 6 mdl: [https://github.com/GreenTrafficLight/Ri ... nder-Addon](https://github.com/GreenTrafficLight/Ridge-Racer-Blender-Addon)

EDIT: I think I have to practice more on forum quote reply

also some of mdl files like the Monstrous, Crinale, Raggio (mentioning this car bcuz it has active aero spoiler so it doesn't have to do with nitrous) etc have some animated parts while engaging nitrous at certain level. Is it also possible to extract those animations from the mdl file or do I have to create it manually in 3d software?

Example of animated parts in this car:

interesting, the last month changes of the blender addon broke the import of both wheel mdl and car mdl, leaving two errors separately.

car import error


common wheel import error
