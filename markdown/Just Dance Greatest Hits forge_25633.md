- Post Title: Just Dance Greatest Hits forge

I was able to extract one of the forge files from jdgh by using this certain script "scimitar_compressed", but now I'm sort of struggling into getting into a certain file "WorldSection01_Content", I tried a lot of programs and didn't work well. If someone is available, I would be very appreciate it if someone is willing to help me.
