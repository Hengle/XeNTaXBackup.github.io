- Post Title: Extractor for a BIN file without compression

There's this game, Digimon World Data Squad (PS2) that I've been meaning to rip assets from, and they're all contained in a file called FS.BIN inside the game's disc... According to [another user on this forum](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=3220), this BIN file has no compression and indexes all the contained files along with their sizes at the very beginning, I opened the file in a hex editor and can confirm that is true.

It seems easy enough to extract, but sadly I have absolutely no experience with file carving whatsoever, so I was hoping anyone here could help me out with a script or an extractor. If this isn't the correct place to ask feel free to let me know, I'm only asking here because I read on the mexcom website that I can ask here.

The index at the beginning of the BIN file is [available here in plain text](https://pastebin.com/KzyYT1vc).
