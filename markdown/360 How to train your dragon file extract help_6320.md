Ok so I can decompress the KXE file with xbcompress then with most of the files i can then open it with winrar and it will get even bigger
but thats where it ends I can open that file with notepad and look at text but i don't know how to know what it is used for or what it is - because there is no file extension

file name 00LLC002 it got renamed my me to 00LLC002-2
here is a 7MB decompressed file from the game in a zip file 1.356MB can anyone look at it who knows more about this stuff to tell me what it is
or is used for - my goal is to find the texture files

edit:
using a hex editor i was able to find the start of a dds file in LVL000 file and i copied it to where i looked like it ended
pasted it in a new file and opened it!
