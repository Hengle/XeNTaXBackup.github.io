- Post Title: [Xbox360] Watch_Dogs 2013 Pre-release models

Hello, on behalf of the Watch Dogs modding community we'd like some help figuring out the pre-release model format for Watch Dogs. All models have been pulled from an Xbox 360 build of the game, however there's no way of accessing them due to the lack of tools and knowledge.

Below I've provided a link containing a Zip with the pre-release model for the main character, an XML version of the release version to help understand the format easier along with the release model itself. The release model is from the PC version of the game, so the byte order is different.
