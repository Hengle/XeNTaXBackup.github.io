- Post Title: Final Fantasy Animation Project

Hi there,

I am an artist based in Australia who works with 3D models and photography. I'm looking for someone to help me out with a simple, small animation project using Final Fantasy models. I'm interested in all skill levels, from beginner to advanced, and am open to a collaborative process in this project. If you are interested please contact me here or in a PM. 

I look forward to hearing from any interested parties.

Best,
nas
