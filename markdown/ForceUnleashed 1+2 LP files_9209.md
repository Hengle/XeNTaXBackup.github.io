- Post Title: ForceUnleashed 1+2 LP files?

Yeah I know this has been asked before and yes I have searched this site but couldnt find anything that helped me. Id like to know how to extract the Force Unleashed 1 and 2 LP files so I can get the gto model.I tried renaming some files with a .rar or .zip extension like was told to do in previous posts but it said the file type wasnt found. I use WinRar and I even tried downloading some other rar and zip extractors but they all said the file type was not supported. 

I am using Windows 7 x64 in case you were wondering. Is there a tutorial somewhere on how to do this or can any of you guys help me out?

The bms script is for [QuickBMS](http://aluigi.altervista.org/quickbms.htm), it'll unpack all of these lp files.

I use [7-Zip](http://www.7-zip.org/) and it'll unpack all of these lp files.

Hey that did work. I tried using that script with MultiEx(which I forgot to mention). So no wonder it wasnt working. I was using the wrong program!!
