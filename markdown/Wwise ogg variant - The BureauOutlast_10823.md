- Post Title: Wwise ogg variant - "The Bureau"/"Outlast"

Hi everybody,

I've encountered some wwise oggs that can't be converted correctly with ww2ogg. None of the three settings work.
Can anyone give an advice? Is this another variant?

Thanks for your help!

Bump!

I have the same problem with the "Guardians of Middle-Earth" audio.

Here is a sample of my own if anyone wants to take a look at it. Maybe find the difference or something.

I think I fixed support for this in 0.20. Use ww2ogg.exe --pcb packed_codebooks_aoTuV_603.bin .
