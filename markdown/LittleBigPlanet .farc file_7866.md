- Post Title: LittleBigPlanet .farc file

I am a complete noob at opening game archives- However, I'm trying to open up the data.farc file in LittleBigPlanet. I've tried all I could, so I decided to resort to this forum. If anyone has a tool, could you let me know? 
Thanks- HellFire

Edit: Download: [http://www.mediafire.com/download.php?8co40o3fct3d45j](http://www.mediafire.com/download.php?8co40o3fct3d45j)

I filecutted it.
Also, I know there's a lot of plain text in there (If you open it with notepad you can see the game's values), however, there is also a lot of "gibberish" which I know is probably the game's data.


Edit 2: The reason I want to open it is to look in the files for possible things they didn't put in the levels.

you must provide one of these files or at least a part of it:

Modifying game files without permission is illegal. Read the EULA of the game, before installation.
But, you are saying  sharing file is illegal. Why you are here then?

no one is going to help you with that attitude.
you need to share part of a file if you want someone to help you with it.
you are not uploading the whole game.

@rengareng
eh?
he is simply referring to share one or more game files so that we can review them and write the extractor.
I see nothing bad or strange...

He never said he wanted to modify it  
Plus he wasn't sure whether it's illegal to distribute game files.
