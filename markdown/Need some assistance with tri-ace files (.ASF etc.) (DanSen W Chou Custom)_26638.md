- Post Title: Need some assistance with tri-ace files (.ASF etc.) (DanSen W Chou Custom)

Hiya all, 
Thought I'd make a thread here so I don't tear my eyes out trying to figure out the below.
I am looking to do a translation of the 3DS game, Danball Senki W Chou Custom, but it is packed with the notorious tri-ace sh*t. It is full of .rif and .seek files, aswell as .awb (I can open .awb)

Now, I can get into everything else, such as .aif etc, I have used quickbms with the rifunpacker, which outputs some .slz files. I then used the slz bms script and I get .unslz. 

Nothing I can find online points to how I can open those .unslz files. I have a feeling theyre 3d models/mesh points. 

Most of this game is purely images, since its a PSP port with a bit extra (the main file is a .cpk). Now, going off the assumption that .rif/seek are 3dmodels/2dmesh, and that 99% of the game is .aif, that would rule out any chance of the text I am after being there, unless I am wrong.

Could somebody potentially point me in the right direction in opening the .unslz files? And if anyone else is interested in a Chou Custom W translation, could you potentially help me find the text? Based of images alone, I can translate everything but the story.

EDIT: .unslz are files with no extention, upon looking at the headers of the files, I can see their actual format. I can open .aifs, but I can't seem to open .asf.

Bump - still looking for some help with this. Link to a sample file: [https://www.mediafire.com/file/onvlwbq5 ... unslz/file](https://www.mediafire.com/file/onvlwbq5wyuxlt4/MESH_0.unslz/file)

It seems going off the header, it's a .ASF model, I tried the Star Ocean ASF viewer and it doesn't work. Both games made by tri-ace.
