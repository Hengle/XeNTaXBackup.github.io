- Post Title: [Dreamcast] Street Fighter III Second Impact .adp files

Hello, Xentax. I need you help once again.

Can anyone at least open one of these files? I tried a number of programs on them and all failed. I do not even need to unpack these - all I need is to listen to what's inside. So if anyone can open this particular type of .adp - please, provide a name of a program you use and, perhaps, a link to it as well. I would be very grateful.

Link to the files: [http://www.mediafire.com/file/7d70id2ozkk57i1/vgm.rar](http://www.mediafire.com/file/7d70id2ozkk57i1/vgm.rar)

Thanks!

Alright, thread's over. I've managed to get a listenable example of the files' contents with the tools written for the game Omikron: The Nomad Soul. The files do not contain what I've looked for.

To top it all off, I've got a power shortage in my house as soon as I've downloaded the files, so I cannot give you the original link to the forums I've got this from. I've reuploaded the whole archive here on my MediaFire though.

adp2wav.exe did the trick. The result at best can be called mediocre, but that's all I've needed. I did not even touched the other tools, so I do not know nothing about them.

Thanks to everyone who took intertest.
