I'm very new to file researching, so please don't be angry if my researched information is wrong:
Are you sure, this file is holding only 1 model? There is a large vertex-array and face-array.

At the beginning there seems to be a table which holds some files-information (offset to vertex begin etc.). After that are the vertex- and face-table. It's a bit complicated for me to understand... maybe I will get it.
