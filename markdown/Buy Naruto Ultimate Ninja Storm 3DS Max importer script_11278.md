Hello everyone.

I'm looking for someone who's able to make a script for the naruto games for ps3 (if it isn't the same for all the games to import to 3ds then it'd be interested to import them from the first game "Naruto ultimate ninja storm" and from the last game "Naruto ultimate ninja storm 3: Full burst").

I need it to be able to import any 3d model such as houses, elements from the scenarios, and most specially characters with their textures, rigs (skeleton, bones, etc), skin and animations to use, edit, export, etc them in 3DS max.

The price is up to who make it, just PM me or reply here with an offer. Please serious people only.

Kind regards

if you're willing to pay for a game script, you better send Rich a PM and donate that money for noesis.

Well. I'm not offering 15$ or any ridiculous amount like he makes fun of. That's why I posted that I'll pay what the coder asks for since its his work for this specific game, that's why I thought it'd be better to post this here

Okay I'm offering more to anyone who is able to make a script or whatever able to take out all the elements from konoha map in NUNS1 with fixed textures and uvs and characters models with fixed textures, uvs, vertex, sking, rig, animations, etc from nuns1 and nuns3. If the animations thing can't be done for someone we would talk about the price for just a script to take the characters and konoha elements with the fixed textures, vertex and uvs.
