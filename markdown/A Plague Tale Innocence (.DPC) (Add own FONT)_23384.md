- Post Title: A Plague Tale Innocence (.DPC) (Add own FONT)

Hello friends.
I hope you are well. Wherever you are.

Well, today I want to say something. To play A Plague-innocence story.

As you know, no one has been able to translate this game into their own language so far, such as: Persian-Arabic and ...

Now I want to ask a series of questions today from those of you who have a lot of information about games with this file format model and use your help.

The first thing I want to say is how to extract the text of this game?
If you know this, please tell me step by step with explanations and how we should do this.
Please explain the name of the software or anything with help.

(Files Format: .DPC/.PCK/.PC)

The second thing I want to say is: how to extract the font of this game and add a font in our own language and add it to the game again?
If you know this, please explain step by step exactly what to do.

I'm ashamed to write a lot of text for you. But I hope we help each other in this way.
This game works very well. But nothing is impossible.

I hope you fully understand.

Thank you very much.

DPC files are pretty complicated. 
I have described here everything I know about these files
[http://wiki.xentax.com/index.php/Asobo_Studio_DPC_DPS](http://wiki.xentax.com/index.php/Asobo_Studio_DPC_DPS)
In most Asobo games text files are just plain text and they are easy to modify.


There is also new ongoing research on FUEL game from Asobo
and all useful documentation can be found here
