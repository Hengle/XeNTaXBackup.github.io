It's pretty much the same format with Rogue Galaxy.
The models are in the data.dat.
The chr container includes mds and tim.
MDS file format similar to Dark Cloud.
The data2.dat is movie file container.

I'd like to give you jessica.
The trouble is, I can't figure out which is jessica.
There are too many files in the folder "chara".
And my number one problem, i don't know how to convert mds 2 obj.
