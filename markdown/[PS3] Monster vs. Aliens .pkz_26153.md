- Post Title: [PS3] Monster vs. Aliens .pkz

Greetings.
I'm trying to unpack a .pkz file from Monster vs. Aliens so I can replace the Xbox buttons with the PS3 ones, but unluckily I haven't found anyone that managed to do it.
I did open a .pak file from the PC game files with a BMS script I found, but not yet a .pkz.
Renaming didn't work as well. Neither opening with 7zip.

Can anyone help me?
For reference, that's the only file I'm looking for: [https://mega.nz/file/snICWDIB#I08csbqw4 ... tdGvaD_twg](https://mega.nz/file/snICWDIB#I08csbqw4xYIWXtZUI0FAVkwJNdi1uA3LtdGvaD_twg)
