- Post Title: plz help for the g1t file~~

This file is from a game called <Escha & Logy Atelier>.
I've unpacked all the pics from g1t file with the quickbms.exe and some script from this forum.
Except a file named "a15_itempic.g1t", it seems like a packed file with many item icons in it.
I have no idea how to fully extract the pics in it.

plz help~~~
here is the link
