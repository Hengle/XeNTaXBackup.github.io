- Post Title: Mario Super Sluggers - dt_na.dat

Hey, I'm looking for some info regarding a dt_na.dat file supplied in the Mario Super Sluggers iso. In it is pretty much all of the game files excluding the video cutscene files. I'm looking to extract the data from dt_na.dat so I can edit some stats. I'm 99% sure it's a proprietary archive file. There are several "db" files (or so they claim to be) from what I can see. Each one is at the following offset:

```
4AA61400
4AA63E00
27D705E0
27D70880
2A9EBB40
2A9EBC00

```


Is there any way to decompile the data? I know it's hard since it's proprietary but are there any tools that can simulate the Wii running on the file? The Wii has to be able to read it somehow, so I assume it's decrypted/decompressed/restored to whatever readable state at the start of the game and loads most of that stuff. Any help appreciated!
