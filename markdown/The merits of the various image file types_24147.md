- Post Title: The merits of the various image file types?

I'm a little stumped by the variety of image files. Could someone please give me a run-through of the various file types? Ideally, I'd like to get a quick note on what makes it special and what its strengths and weaknesses are.

Also, if I forgot your favorite image file type, please enlighten me.

Well, you could just check this category on Xentax Wiki
[http://wiki.xentax.com/index.php/Category:Format_Image](http://wiki.xentax.com/index.php/Category:Format_Image)
to read our notes on various image types that has been already documented.

My personal favourites are BMP and PNG
[http://wiki.xentax.com/index.php/BMP_Image](http://wiki.xentax.com/index.php/BMP_Image)
[http://wiki.xentax.com/index.php/PNG_Image](http://wiki.xentax.com/index.php/PNG_Image)

BMP - only because it is common and very simple
PNG - because it is chunk based, common, well documented and has support for many features
