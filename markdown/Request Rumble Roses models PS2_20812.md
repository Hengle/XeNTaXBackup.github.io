- Post Title: Request: Rumble Roses models PS2

hi all,
I was reading an old thread about the rumble roses extraction tool and PAC files. It seems that those links to the files have since gone down. I am hoping to extract the Reiko model into 3ds max (with textures of course) for use in a small video project.

Might anyone help me with this? Actually what would be even more convenient is if you have the model itself that you wouldn't mind sharing.
