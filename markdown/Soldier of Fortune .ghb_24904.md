- Post Title: Soldier of Fortune *.ghb

sample file: [https://mega.nz/file/ITAHGaAZ#xJjlWn4K3 ... e8PI6bAo0g](https://mega.nz/file/ITAHGaAZ#xJjlWn4K33jpZd8QyWbJGHXnYX8UQ5PMQe8PI6bAo0g)

I examined through the hex editor unfortunately the model looks broken in hex2obj due to skin weights/animations

I believe that .ghb (Ghoul binary) files are compiled with a program called GPREP from .gfl files (which were exported using Softimage 3D):




Any help in researching the .ghb format from Soldier of Fortune?

Thanks in advance.

EDIT: The GHB format importer is included in Noesis.
