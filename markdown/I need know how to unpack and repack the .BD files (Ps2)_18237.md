- Post Title: I need know how to unpack and repack the .BD files (Ps2)

I used google translator (sorry for my bad english)

I want to translate the voices of the game zatch bell mamodo battles into Spanish, I opened the file with psound, I could also play and convert .wav files, but I could not import them.
Does anyone know with what tools I could import my own files?

this is the file that contains the audios

And a capture to the file contents

I, too, had a compression of the files, and my information generally disappeared somewhere. I have a panic about what to do. I can not solve this problem independently. Well that I found [https://www.salvagedata.com/](https://www.salvagedata.com/)
