- Post Title: Gamecube PSO Ep I&II nj file help

Hello all! This is my first post here after stumbling across this site. I was wondering hoping someone here could help me figure out a problem I am having. I am a newbie (like less than 1 week of knowledge) with this, so please be patient with me. I am trying to learn!

Phantasy Star Online has bml files in it that store other compressed models/files. I found a site that explains how the headers work, and I have manually extracted some of the files using HxD and then decompressed them using a tool that I found. 

I have read that you can use Noesis to view these models, but every time I try to open one of them, Noesis crashes, and I'm not sure if it's because I've done something wrong or what. The bml headers call out the compressed and uncompressed sizes for the models, and the files that I have created match those values exactly, so I feel like I have the right data.

Let me know if I should provide any other information that I may have forgotten. Hopefully someone out there can help me figure this out! Thank you in advance!
