Not all of the plugins allow you to create new archives - this can even be the case if you can replace or add resources to existing archives. My suggestion would be to copy an existing archive and replace the resources in it with your own, and rename it if you want.

Perhaps you should try reinstalling the plugin, then? Aside from that, I really can't help you much, you'll have to wait for a reply from Mr.Mouse or Rahly...

What version of MultiEx Commander are you running? Can you attach here the debug.log file after you start ? It's in the data directory. 

Thanks.
