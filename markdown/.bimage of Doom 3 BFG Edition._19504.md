- Post Title: .bimage of Doom 3 BFG Edition.

Hi,


I looked around this forum for very long (this place is useful and awesome) and I found topics about the .bimage format for several games, among them RAGE, Wolfenstein TNO, Dishonored 1/2, The Evil Within 1/2. I was wondering if the case of Doom 3 BFG Edition's .bimage format could be treated too, I've been trying to get my hands on those textures files for years but I can't get my head around the complexity of decoding/decompiling a file.

I try .bimage converters of each of those games in Noesis and also Quickbms, but it seems none of the scripts works for any game but the one it was written for.


I hope for someone to point my struggles in the right direction to achieve my goal of converting .bimage files from D3 BFG Edition to an usable image format.


Here's a zip with samples for whatever is worth:

Thank you in advance!

Hi Acewell, thanks for your response!


The samples are taken from the PC version, it seems like the script is working to some extent. Specular maps seems to appear correctly, but diffuse and normal maps have problems with their channels, for instance the normal map's blue channel has no data, and what is intended to be the red channel is placed in the alpha one.




All in all this is exiting, finally I think this is getting somewhere!

nothing i can do about the colors, that is the way the data was stored.  
i have seen green and yellow normal map images in other games so i think this is not unusual.
the game engine was likely designed to decode the images in this way.

Oh I see. Then probably the game treat textures in a way I'm not use to, I wish I know more about id tech 5 dealing with texture channels.

This is the texture:



Inspecting the channels I found this:

Red Channel:


Green Channel:


Blue channel is just a solid tone.

Alpha channel:


I think the real data is in channel alpha since looks like a greyscale version of the intended texture, so I think red and green channels are used in a different way to color the data in the alpha channel, not as regular RGB channels works for simple images as I know.

Edit: I started reading about color formats and I found about color spaces, seems like maybe this is a case of YVU/CMYK color format, problem is I don't know how to convert this to a RGB color space properly.
