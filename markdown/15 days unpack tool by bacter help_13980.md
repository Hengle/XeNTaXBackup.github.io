- Post Title: "15 days" unpack tool by bacter help

Hello!
I'm trying to unpack "15 days" game archives. This is quest by House of Tales.
I'm found this topic: [Help with 15 days resource.xxx unpacking and repacking](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=4653). 
[bacter](http://forum.xentax.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&u=21446) wrote tool for unpack this game archives, but into topic no more links on it... I'm send him PM, but he still didn't answer. Maybe someone save bacter's tool or know how contact with him?

Also i'm found QuickBMS script:
[http://aluigi.altervista.org/bms/15days.bms](http://aluigi.altervista.org/bms/15days.bms)
But script work incorrectly.
