- Post Title: Earth Seeker (Wii) Font Font8x16.fon

Hello. I need replace font file or image to make localizing and translate.
With Earth Seeker Japanese. It has font files(Font5x12.fon .. Font8x16. total 4 files). It only got Alphabet and numbers and Japanese Characters I assumed.
I don't know there's proper font tool that game's .fon file edit or replace.
so I tried whether to get extracted font images from that files with CrystalTile2 or not. 
In result,



It's Tile editor mode. I think(al least) almost close to distinguish
as alphabet character but still to fail to get clear image.


It's hexa edit mode of previous area. as you can see there's shapes like
a,b,c,d...

Is there any way to get clear font image using CrystalTile2 or other?

DO I need making custom .tbl file to get clear font image using CrystalTile2?
(built-in presets seems doesn't match with this font files)

If I get image and replacing the font, can I success localizing and translate?
(I'm sorry to write barely English. I'm Asian. Korean.)

I forget to bring font files that mentioned(leave to home).
as soon as I get them I gonna upload to share to help fiding your solutions
