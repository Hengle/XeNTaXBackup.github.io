Hi, NSW textures are swizzled, you must use RawTextureCooker. You must set 0xOFFSET at 78 and tick Switch swizzle and r8g8b8a8_typeless, set resolution at 512*256 (256 under OFFSET) then drag and drop .nxtex file at program and hit Try and convert. It generate viewable .DDS file  If you want know more send me PM
