Just rename that Font.pak to Font.ttf. It's TrueType font.

Sorry, I was mistaken.   I found that the font didn't change ,although I deleted the game fonts.pak file and replaced it with another font .ttf and renamed it to fonts.pak the game still working with the old font. I tried to delete the fonts.pak file the game still can work without any font file. Any suggestions?
