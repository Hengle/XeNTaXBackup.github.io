- Post Title: XBOX360 Hack Need help to repack the files.

Hi,

1st Let me say sorry for bad spelling.

Ok I have come here because I need some help with the hacking of xbox360 files. And you may be abull to help me and add it to Xentax.

I can unpack the files but the problem is repacking the files. I have added the x360 tool and the source code that unpacks some of the files but it will not repack them.
So I am in BIG hope's that some of the coders here can help me and get some big rep in the hacking of the 360.

I have allso added a small file from the 360 that is packed for you to sampull.

And thanx for your help.

Just opening the file I recall this from Angerwound from 360gamesaves :

> Yup, basically every file on the hdd is signed it seems; except for Backward Compatibility stuff and your music soundtrack. The themes I believe are signed with PIRS and LIVE headers; meaning the key they were signed with exists only to MS. The files containing a CON_ file header suggest the file was created by you. Therefore, their signing key resides in the 360 console itself. I guess if someone ends up dumping the decrypted kernel or sniffs this key you could recreate CON_ files.

Your file - pgr3theme - first 4 bytes - PIRS

Ok I never asked about the signing of files I have that sorted for now. I asked about the reinjeting of files.

Allso the ppl over at 360gamesaves.com have made a very nice program But thay have no Idear what thay are on with. I went to ther site munths back thrying to thell them that I had found out how to put a bigger DH in the 360 and all thay did was flame me and some of the ppl that had been working on it. Thay dident even see that the 360 can format HD's and lets face it thay have only just figerd out that you can use custem sound tracks on xbox1 games that are played on the 360.

After the flameing we all sat down and spoke about wether to put up pics on how to do it. But we desided to say F**k you to them for flaming us and not bothering to wate till we purfeted it.

If I have ppl come on to my site telling me that thay have dun stuff to a xbox we give them help to purfet the hack not slag them down.

After makeing over 8 difrent installer disks and a lot of programs that go on the xbox I do not take kindly to being slaged off and told me and my frends are full of bull. But is seems now that ther is one or two companys redy to bring out biger HD's for the 360. So was ther loss.

Eg... Me and one of my old frends needed to unpack the .umd file in rainbowsix 3 and RS3 BA. We came here and hay presto... We got the adon file we needed to unpack it and repack it.

Ther is one grate problem with the xbox comunaty at the min and that is that all the xbox hackers out ther all whant to be the 1st to hack the 360 and get rep for it. Insted of all chiping in and helping eachother out to get the most out of it.

That is a very common problem with this type of thing it seems. It's all about "honour", whatever that may be when it comes to modding. In my opinion you shouldn't protect the format of game files, just to look cool. Instead you should enlarge the mod-community of your favourite game, by releasing this sort of information and then stand out by creating a damn good mod. This way you get credits for figuring out the format AND for making an excellent mod. Much better than being the only one who can do stuff and showing it by crappy mods. To really enhance the gaming experience everyone should be able to work on implementing new ideas. 

However, to what purpose does one want to hack an XBox360?

A very good qwestion...

The posabilatys are endless, From linux to windows runing on the 360, Home made games, Mods and so on.

But the mod I am working on at the min it with the live content. If I can injeckt the files I can add new files and add New moded maps to the games and so on.

I did this with the 1st xbox and the only thing I had to wory about was the contentmeta.xbx wich was sined with the epprom key and the HD key of the xbox.

But I am allso working on replaceing all the files with a home made dashbord app. Its a long story on how to do it but I realy need to be abull to add files in to the other files so that I can work with it. THat is why I came here to the masters of file unpacking for some help.

So do you have any news?

And as for that ass over at 360gamesaves if you can inject files and delet files from the theams then you will be abull to make your own theams.

Fine, was just a suggestion that you could/might be wasting your time with this approach. I don't know the answer myself and the job looks to be quite a task. For all this talk about people wanting the glory for themselves is a bit untrue. I don't have a 360 or care for one. I just enjoy looking at the files themselves. I won't get into intentions or motives of this. 

Anyhow, they have a community that add to the wiki and share information. (no glory no names)

Check out the info for the file:

I am not saying that it is not a hard task and I need some help with it that is why I have come away from the xbox community and come here wher I know I will get some help.

Take a look at the xbox.umd files in most of ubisofts games all the ppl out ther sead that it culd not be unpacked but when I came across XeNTaX and renamed the .umd to .bin and other file tipes I knew that the file was like a .rar so then I payed for the program and we spoke to the admin and he made us a .umd16 addon for it.

I know that it has nothing to do with the 360 realy but I am just showing that we find most programs to hack the xbox from programs that you hack the pc with.

I have confidence that the XeNTaX team can help me thay have dun it befor and no dout thay will do it agen and agen. And this is why I told them that if thay help me I will make them a new forum skin if thay like.
That bit of give and that bit of take.

As for the linux community playing with the 360 I play a part with them allredy. And I can ashor you that I have read that page more than once. I no you are not calling me a noob but I can ashor you that I am not and keep upto date with any hacks or info that get found out and put on the net.

The files will need signed, if you change one thing the file will no longer work.  What is so hard to understand about that?  

If you have found out how to resign Xbox 360 content, then why don't YOU share this with everybody, since you claim that nobody wants to share, and by not sharing you become the person you yourself are flaming.

Let's quote this again to make it stick. Without a proper modchip you can't touch signed files at all. No way, no how.

And there isn't a modchip for X360. (Hacked Firmware doesn't count)
