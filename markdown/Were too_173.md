What do you mean? You can import your files into archives that are supported for importation. For instance, if you extract sounds from , say, PAK files, you can edit them, and then use MultiEx Commander again to replace the original files in the PAK archive with your edited sounds.

I should have been more clear, I have the editors, and down loaded two models for RA2, and wanted to see if I could use them in the game, how would I go about doing so?
