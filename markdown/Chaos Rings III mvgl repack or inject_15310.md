- Post Title: Chaos Rings III mvgl repack or inject

Hi,

I've successfully extracted the mvgl file for the Chaos Rings III game, but I cannot inject or import the new files back to the .mvgl file because the file size doesn't match with the old one.

A little help would be appreciated.

Thanks in advance.
