- Post Title: KF2 Editor opens certain cooked .UPK files from other games

I was wondering if anyone could take a look at the reason why the Killing Floor 2 editing tools (Available on Steam even if you don't own KF2) will open certain cooked .UPK files from other games. But crash on others.

For those wondering the KF2 editor is a custom version of the Unreal Editor

The example I'll give is from the game Bless.

The file name is AN_PC_Elf_F_Nudebody.upk

As you can see it imports into the editor.
However the file containing the texture: CH_PC_ElfF_F.upk
will crash at 50%

The UPK tools found at: [https://forums.nexusmods.com/index.php? ... ing-tools/](https://forums.nexusmods.com/index.php?/topic/820867-here-are-upk-modding-tools/)
will extract the files from CH_PC_ElfF_F.upk
