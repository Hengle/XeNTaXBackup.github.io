- Post Title: Tokyo Ghoul: re Call to Exist Tool

Tool for loading/extracting models from the PC version of the game. Geometry, materials/textures, skeleton and skinning supported. Seems to work fine with most of the stuff. Stages may take some time to load and export.

Tool overview and example exported model



How to use

Load

PAC : Loads models and textures in pac files. You will need "_res.pac" files. 
Export

NEX : Exports the model in custom binary format (.nexh), intended to be loaded by Noesis. Noesis script for this format : Nexh Script
OBJ: Exports the model in OBJ format. Used automatically for stages.
PNG : Exports the textures in PNG format.
Note  : Models and textures will be exported into the folder Export.
