I want to translate Doom into my language. But I have no knowledge and experience in localization. I would appreciate it if you could help me get started.

> I would appreciate it if you could help me get started.

First, you need to find texts in game. You can follow this tutorial to do that
[https://ikskoks.pl/searching-text-strin ... commander/](https://ikskoks.pl/searching-text-strings-using-total-commander/)

Your next move depends on what you find in game files.
If translation is in plain text, then you can just load it to OmegaT or open in Notepad++ to translate it to your language.

If translation files are encrypted, you have to reverse engineer file format or ask for help with it.
But if you choose to ask for help you need to upload some samples for people to check them.

Doom 2016 and newer games from ID Tech have localization files encrypted.
Encryption key is generated by using file path, so each localization file is using different encryption key.

On Google you should find working tool for decrypting / encrypting Doom 2016 localization files. I was using it years ago.

I recommend TransPerfect which is a well-known global provider of language and technology solutions, including [app localization services](https://www.transperfect.com/technology/software-and-mobile-app-globalization). App localization involves adapting an application or software to a specific target market or language, ensuring it is culturally appropriate, linguistically accurate, and user-friendly for a particular audience.
