I am playing this game for a while and I want to try to edit some files and this is one of the files that I cannot decrypt with this [Forum Post](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=35&t=6986).

Is it possible to decrypt, edit and then encrypt it with the same method ?

If so what should I try ? or how should I accomplish it ?

Done.

```
        MStarDecrypt <pType> <pInFile> <pOutFile>
```


```
        MStarDecrypt -1 DefaultEngine.ini DefaultEngine_Decrypted.ini
```


For some INI's you need use type -2

```
        MStarDecrypt -2 NurienEsScore.ini NurienEsScore_Decrypted.ini
```


Also tool can decrypt localization files. (type -1)

> Having a Hashing Verification Error   

How can I fix, bypass or edit the hash issue :/
You need encrypt file back after editing. Examples:

Decrypt

```
MStarDecrypt -2 NurienEsScore.ini NurienEsScore_Decrypted.ini
```

Encrypt

```
MStarDecrypt -2 NurienEsScore_Decrypted.ini NurienEsScore.ini
```
