Hey Guys,

is this Game AxE (see Subject) a UE4 based Game or Unity3D?
Because many Websites write UE4 but the lib in the Gamefolder say Unity.


Website: [https://axe.nexon.com/](https://axe.nexon.com/)
APK: [https://apkpure.com/de/axe-alliance-vs- ... axe.global](https://apkpure.com/de/axe-alliance-vs-empire/com.nexon.axe.global)

Best Regards

You can use UTinyRipper to extract the files but you'll only be able to import them on unity engine. Don't know if there's a way to export them on 3ds max

I always use Nox Emulator, install the .apk. Then install "ES File Explorer" to locate the source files. Then install "Root Checker" Because you can only extract the files with a Rooted Emulator.

Question from me... If I extract the files can I import them into Unity? If so.. What kind of file types can I import or open with Unity?

You can import them only after extracting them with UtinyRipper or DevX. At that point you can usualy open "everything".
From time to time some games have kinda like strange animation display, or lacking the model prefab, or the animation get exported with bone references so it doesn't work, maybe you need some script loaded on it (and those usually don't get extracted)
