In the meantime, feel free to post your key-related troubles, I'm sure Mr.Mouse wouldn't mind a work queue awaiting his return... *prepares to be banned on Mr.Mouse's return*

How long does it normally take to get the serial code email after donating?  

Thanks.

It depends on time to process them. Usually 1-3 days max. 90% on the same day.

Well, version 4.2 was more than a year old, and 4.3 is a step forward to more easy of use with updating new game support, but also more online use. 

So an upgrade is indeed necessary. If you've donated in august or september 2006, that will come to $2,00, if before that, then $4,00. We may be non-profit, but we still have bills to pay. 

Drop an email at the registration email address if you wish to upgrade and if you know in which category you fall. We'll check the details and confirm then.

I originally purchased 4.2.0 for $6, and on Nov. 27, 2006 I sent another payment of $4 to total the $10, and I have not received a 4.3.0 code yet.

Hi,

I donated for my rego key some time last year and all has been working fine since, but since then i have formatted my PC and have lost my rego key. I was wondering if you would be able to recover my key again, and what version of multiex i need to download in order for the key to work? 

thanks,
toby

v 4.2. 

Since you donated in the two months period before release of 4.3, you can upgrade to a new code with a small extra donation of two bucks ($2,00). 

Cheers

It has been more than two years since the last version, and thus the code expired.

Ummm, OK, so now what? I have to spend another $10? I thought my $10 bought lifetime updates?

This appears on the Friends of MultiEX donation page as one of the reasons to donate and receive a registration key:


    Become a Friend of MultiEx
    and recieve a registration key
    to unlock advanced features
    as a token of gratitude!

    Get these Great Features :

[other reasons snipped for brevity]

    Ensure forward compatibility!


I would consider a new version of MultiEX "forward compatibility".

I'm not trying to give you a hard time, but where does it state that anywhere within the donation area? 

It's not my fault that there hasn't been any updates in two years -- I paid my support money and received exactly ONE version of MultiEX. If you're going to place a time limit or a number of updates on the donation's value then state it clearly on the donation page.

This sounds like a shady policy to me, just my humble opinion as a paid supporter -- unlike untold hundreds or even thousands that steal the program by getting a crack serial (and you know that happens all the time).

I know. The very reason those thousands use the cracked / shared serials is why I've opted to implement a new serial system. Hence, I could not ensure forward compatibility at this time. Tell you what, PM me and we figure something out

Hey guys,

I registered my multiEx a few weeks ago.  MultiEx itself works fine but I am not able to launch MexBinderPlus.exe

It tells me that it requires the registration of MultiEx, but it's already registered.

Am I doing something wrong here?

I've attached a screenshot.


Thanks,

 jawharp
