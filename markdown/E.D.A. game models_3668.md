I will look when I get home but have you tried the most basic of all, to just use winrar, right-click and choose extract to? Sometimes it's just a zip archive. But I guess you have tried stuff like that

It uses this program to compress:

[http://www.eldos.com/solfs/](http://www.eldos.com/solfs/)


But the file is encrypted with a password I can't find (in plain-text). Maybe someone can help

It also states in the update exe about mark adler

In another file, I see this:

0x000027C6	0x0000001C	LegalCopyright
0x000027E4	0x0000005A	Copyright (C) 1991-2007, RAD Game Tools, Inc.

RAD game tools is a 3d engine that we know of

Thanks for the quick reply.

About the password encrypted archive, it seems familier as softnyx other game Rakion also uses a password
for their archive. But that file is *.xfs 

I have tried opening it with ixfs which isn't working. I think because of the new updated xfs.
Also softnyx is trying to do whatever to keep it difficult for hackers/crackers to inspect their games.

But if it uses a password to open the archive, does that mean the password is located somewhere in the other files?
Like the runtime file to play the game or maybe the patching tool?

edit* yes I also tried renaming it to rar and zip. Both no-go

well the game also needs to unpack the file to get access to the files, otherwise it can't show the files 

There are methods to "see" what the exe does when it is unpacking but you need to have skills with progs like ollydbg etc. If someone with knowledge has the game it will be quite easy. It's liks chhrox tutorial on retrieving passwords when the game updates.

Ok, I have tried using the tutorial and have been using the h3x and cheatengine tools to get the information I need.
But.. when the patcher is launched, gameguard is hiding the process. As in, it's not showing up on the list.
I really don't like gameguard, simply because it blocks 3DVIA printscreen and 3D ripper DX

Once their patch server is back online I will be able to find the password "I hope" I can get past gameguard but with the patch server down I can not get the password.
