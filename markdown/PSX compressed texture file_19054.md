- Post Title: PSX compressed texture file

Game: Plucky's big adventure (E)

I translated all the game in my language, but I don't know how change the image with the language selector, I can't find it into the iso files.

If I dump the RAM and the VRAM I can see it with TiledGGD setting the 16bit format, but only with a memory dump, then the image is compressed. How uncompress it and recompress after the hack?

Please help me, I miss only this silly thing to close the project.
