- Post Title: Anyone can teach me how to unpack the.s3e-Xe3u file below this Topic

I’ve decompress the s3e file and there‘s a file with 
header ’XE3U‘ inside, I’ve tried some script to extract it
to get the arm code inside but all failed. Anyone can help
me please please please!
The link of the XE3U file: [https://shawnares.lanzoue.com/iK6NB121rhti](https://shawnares.lanzoue.com/iK6NB121rhti)
Thanks!
