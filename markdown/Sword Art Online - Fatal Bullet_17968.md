Has anyone had any luck extracting from this game?

The assets are stored in an 11gb file: SAOFB\Content\Paks\SAOFB-WindowsNoEditor.pak
There's also a 700kb file in that same directory: SAOFB-WindowsNoEditor.sig

The only speculation I have found about this is from a different forum with someone else making such a request, the reply they got:

> If it is like the other Bandai game that I have experience modding, then the pak decrypt tool won't work even if you do find the RSA encryption key in the exe or dll files.

I haven't had any issues getting into the PAK files with the encryption key

Hello , 

I need help, I do not know anything in the Unpack I am a real noob ^^

I understand that it was necessary to slip the .pak in the UE4PakUnpacker software but I do not understand the continuation with the key of decryption

when I put the .pak in UE4PakUnpacker I have a message that * TProgressBar property out of range *


Thanks to whoever can help me

Don't use the UE4PakUnpacker software.
Save the key and put it in when UModel ask for it.
