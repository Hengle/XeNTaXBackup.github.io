- Post Title: [Request] Gungrave O.D

Hey.
This is a difficult question because it is the PS2 system.

Quality lower model, but
Interest is formed.

data.bin thought might be compressed file.
However, as Gungrave. YTX. YSN will think this would be the format.
(But, This also does not decode...)

if anyone Gungrave  has tried to decompress, Teach me.
Would be a big help to me.

The end.

P.S : If anyone need sample file. please tell me.
