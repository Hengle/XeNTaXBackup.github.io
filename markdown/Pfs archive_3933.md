it's a normal zip file with different magic fields.
download my zip.bms script from [http://aluigi.org/papers/bms/zip.bms](http://aluigi.org/papers/bms/zip.bms)

now open it with notepad and replace the following numbers:
0x0403 with 0x4853
0x0201 with 0x4653
0x0605 with 0x4453

now run it with QuickBMS and that's all :)
