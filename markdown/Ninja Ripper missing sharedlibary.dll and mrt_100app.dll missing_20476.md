- Post Title: Ninja Ripper missing "sharedlibary.dll" and "mrt_100app.dll" missing

i have a unique situation, im trying to rip a file from an app on the microsoft store, but since where all the apps are stored are in a hidden file, its weird and glitchy.
i can open the app normally, but when i hit run on ninja ripper, it shows these two error msgs.

I have made the file a normal file but things are still buggy.
