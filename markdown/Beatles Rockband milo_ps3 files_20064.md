- Post Title: Beatles Rockband milo_ps3 files

Hi, hopefully I'm posting in the right section of the forum here. I'm using Arktool to pry into the files for The Beatles Rockband PS3 and I found several of these ".milo_ps3" files which I have no experience in. I assume they contain the actual meshes of the characters and skeletons etc.

I've zipped up a few of them here for anyone to take a look at and see if anything can be made of them? That'd be very much appreciated.

Let me know if there's anything else I can do.
