- Post Title: Get a lot of the usual information

Hello all 
I have been trying to make an indepth Dragon Quarter guide but have not had alot of luck finding formula's for damage and other things. I have been using cheat engine to get a lot of the usual information. If anyone would be able to help me or or point me in a direction it would be greatly appreciated. 
Thank
