- Post Title: Valkyrie Profile Silmeria .PK1 data?

I’ve read here [viewtopic.php?f=16&t=8763](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=8763) that its possible extract the data from the Valkyrie Profile Silmeria, but even when they point its possible extract some models after unpack .SLZ data, I find kind hard to believe, as after extract you only get around 40 .SLZ and not exactly too big…

I was more impress with the .PK1 data, as they’re almost 1000 and the size goes from 48mb to 1byte, where they’re more than 200 around 500-800kb (which I think are models of NPC and characters)

So, I kind wonder if someone has scrip or something for take an eye to the .PK1 data, because I read here too that they use to be a 3D Max scrip, but the data has being erase from were it was upload

I’ve attach the triAce-PS2.exe, the unpacked for extract all the data from triAce games (because it did take me hours find it, all because were they upload or the page was down or the download was removed)

The triAce-PS2.exe works as command line, so it just having the .ISO of the game on the same folder of the triAce-PS2.exe and use the command on CMD (Run as Administrator on Win7-10 (on 10, try more than once if it doesn’t work)

```
triAce-PS2.exe “.Iso name” “C:\output folder”
```


Obviously without the “ and  putting the name of the iso and the output folder you want to extract it.

I really wish to have some of the models of this game, because it’s the only Valkyrie Profile game on 3D, because using the NinjaRipper with the Pcsx2 it’s not a good idea… (they don’t extract right, more like with a weird form)
