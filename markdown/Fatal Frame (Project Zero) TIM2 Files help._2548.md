- Post Title: Fatal Frame (Project Zero) TIM2 Files help.

I used the Jaeder Naub tool to extract these, and I got alot more. 
But all of the images are really small and in 8bit resolution. 
Is there anything I can do to get these in a bigger format?

im sorry to say that if they where extracted that way then they are the original size and bit depth. no conversion is done on TIM2 images.

so....there is not much to do :/

Exactly what I was thinking. It seems to be how it should be. Textures often aren't very huge. Thats just a head/face texture anyways so it would only cover the face thus it would not be all that big at all.

Thank you for answering! I just think it's wierd that they're so small, you'd think the quality would  be worse ingame? And textures from other games seem to be alot bigger. I've also noticed that it's usually 512x512, but I might be wrong...

Another thing, I just tried to load a texture file from Silent Hill 3 which is alot bigger. And it came out small (changed from 512x512 to a 128x128)

Hm... sometimes there are differently sized textures for further off distanced objects to make sure the game doesn't slow down. Otherwise I'm uncertain.

Im not really sure i understand what you mean by "loading it into jaeder naub". but i can only assume you loaded a JPEG into jaeder naub which it then ripped as smaller.

if so, that is a bug in the JPEG ripper. but it only exist on that specific detector. (and jaederstorm only, if jaederstorm isnt used then the JPEGs
will be detected correctly) ,but anyways, im not fully sure if thats what you meant 

but on raw images such as TIM or the SH3 Textures that is impossible.

if you use the SH3 Texture ripper inside jaeder naub on 
the texture archives you will get very high res outputs 
some even go up to 1024x1024.

Yes, that's what I did. 
I see. Is it possible that there might me highpoly textures hidden, but in another format, not TIM2?

I'm not sure what you mean with "if jaderstorm is used" it's a file in the Jaeder Naub folder. Don't know if the version I have is bugged, could you give me a link to a bugfree version? And I don't know what you mean with using the SH3 Texture ripper inside jeader naub? (I'm a total n00b,sorry)
