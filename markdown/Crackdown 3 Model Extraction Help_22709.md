- Post Title: Crackdown 3 Model Extraction Help

Hi there! I'm new to this site and I'm glad that there's such an active community based on anything related to video games, including game modding.
I hope you do not mind my first post on this site being in regards to a video game that I have not seen been touched before on here.

I need help extracting character models from Crackdown 3, which is a very universally acclaimed game [/sarcasm]. The game only runs on certain versions of Windows 10 (namely 1803) so I downgraded to be able to run this title. The issue with it is that it is a UWP application with no main executable can be run on its own, so to my knowledge ripping programs like NinjaRipper will not be of any assistance to me. No ripping programs or viewing programs were useful in this case (such as UModel, which crashed whenever I tried to extract what was likely a model file), though certain textures are able to be ripped this way, which I'll need for the models in question. After installing Unreal Engine and unpacking the game's files none of the .uasset files (which make up every asset internally; the assets stored in the /Nimbus/ folder) cannot be opened with either the latest version of Unreal Engine OR any versions that would have been used to make the game.

I'm at a loss here, so any assistance would be greatly appreciated. I'm sorry if none of this information is useful as it; let me know if I can describe the issue much further.

If game is Unreal Engine built then look in this forum for threads by daemon1 where he released quite a few number of tools for said engine, and it might work to some extent for your game, you got nothing to loose other than some spare time.
Giving the fact its a new game one of the tools might work.

have fun

Doesn't Gildor's tool work with Unreal Engine?

Thank you for the suggestion! I took a look at some of daemon1's tools that they made for Unreal Engine, but the issue with all of those that I have seen is that they require an executable or to add/replace a .dll file. These aren't useful as this is a UWP application, meaning that there is not any executable present that can be ran to play the game, nor do the .dlls apply to this game.

From what I've seen, yes, but the .uasset files included in Crackdown 3 have model files that cannot be extracted due to the program crashing while attempting to do so.

Not sure what I'm doing wrong here or if I'm not looking correctly for the tools in question.
