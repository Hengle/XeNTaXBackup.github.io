- Post Title: Does anyone know about .GAN file format? (animation files)

I extracted some animation files from Fatal Frame 4 (wii) and it gave me these .GAN files, which I already searched everywhere and didn't find anything about it. Does anyone know about .GAN file format? Link to the files here: [https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/ ... WOVojVg3ic](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-B1-AUWZsi_TBMW0ZQIELFWOVojVg3ic)
*(the GAN files are inside the "motion" folder)*
