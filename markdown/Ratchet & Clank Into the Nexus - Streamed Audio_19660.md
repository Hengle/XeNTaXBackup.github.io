- Post Title: Ratchet & Clank: Into the Nexus - Streamed Audio

Looking for the game's music, I found streamed audio in the "global_uncached.psarc" file located in the packed/game/ folder. Unfortunately, only the beginnings of different music tracks were extracted. The other global .psarc files in "packed" contain dialog or other assets, and I cannot find the continuations of the music tracks. Would either the highlights.dat or highmips.dat files be of any interest? If not, where would I find other streamed audio?

Here is a [link](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1lTRPW27yx2PF_KAYrwKdOan2QKXNgu-Z) to the .pkg file.
