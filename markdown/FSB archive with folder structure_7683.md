- Post Title: FSB archive with folder structure

Hi!
I need help with an FSB file that has a given folder structure in an external file (see attachment). The original FSB file can be extracted with Luigi's fsbext but due to the many duplicates it takes a lot of time to re-create the folder structure.
Is there a QuickBMS script that is able to extract fsb archives? Because then it would be really easy to adjust it to support this kind of structure!
Thanks for any help!
Regards, Timo

This is a shot in the dark so… If it’s what I think it is the FSB archive does not have a folder structure, the file you provided is referring to categories in FEV files like so



If you come across any FEV files in this game open them with Fmod Event Player and check the Category tab you should see those same entry from this list you provided If my theory is correct.
