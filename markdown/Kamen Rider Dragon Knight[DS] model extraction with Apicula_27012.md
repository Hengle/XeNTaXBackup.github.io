- Post Title: Kamen Rider Dragon Knight[DS] model extraction with Apicula

Hi, I'm technically new to model extraction, for a while now I've been trying to extract Kamen Rider Dragon Knight models from DS, which worked "relatively well", because although the mesh has no errors and even has bones, it doesn't have any textures or animations, which is strange because I've tried it with other games and it worked correctly, so I want to know if someone can help me with this.

Sometime, textures and animations are separate files, NSBTX and NSBTA respectively. to convert all of them in one file, you'll have to import the model first, textures second and the animation last, all in the same command.
