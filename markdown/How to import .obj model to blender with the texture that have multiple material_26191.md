- Post Title: How to import .obj model to blender with the texture that have multiple material

So im newbie on blender and wanted to make an edit or view the 3d model on blender. I can already import the .obj file with File > Import > Wavefront, but it is just the model not the texture. I already switch to render preview but still no texture like this:



The model itself has multiple materials like the image from material 1 to material 36 and the folder has a .mtl file which I don't know what the use is for. Here is the image :



The texture itself is on atlas texture or baked or I don't know how to call it. There are multiple textures too from accessories, body, leg, head, and hair. I give one example from the accessories part:



So how do I apply each texture part to the model? I search the same question here and on youtube but it seems there is no topic that is similar to my question.
