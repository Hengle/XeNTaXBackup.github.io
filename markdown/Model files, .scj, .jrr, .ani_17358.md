- Post Title: Model files, .scj, .jrr, .ani

Hello! I found these model files on my PC I can't remember which game it was from unfortunately it is just in a folder called "MODELS".

I have tried to use the program ModelResearcher to get a hint of what kind of models it is, I have the texture for each .scj & .jrr files..
What I can figure out is that .scj works as .obj file and .jrr works as .mdl file. 

When I use ModelResearcher, whatever I do all vertexes goes in the middle, tried to add padding etc, nothing happend, not sure if I am doing something wrong or not..

Anyway, I was wondering if there's an possibility to convert these to .obj files OR direct import for 3ds max, any of which would be nice.
Thank you and I have some of the files uploaded ofcourse.

@AceWell

Hello! as I have tried out a bunch with hex2obj which works soo fine!
I could not seem to make anything of the UV's except of making it export as .obj instead of something like .mdl, do you have any suggestions to how to make it easier than to mapping it yourself? Thanks in advance

Nevermind, figured it out by "save as mesh"... Did not see that before ^^'

How do you know what fvf & UV pos to use? Is there a way to find it within the file itself or do you just try out until it works?

edit: nevermind figured that out haha, wow it was that easy. thanks a lot yet again
