- Post Title: Checking files inside of files

This may looks like an crazy idea, but there is a "file checker" somewhere on the WWW?!
What i am looking is: a program that searches a file, trying to find hex combinations that may be headers of known files

For example if i have a file:

"62 8A B2 E2 00 00"

and the "62 8A B2" is a known header of the "BMP" files, the program tells me about it.
Thanks for the help!

Yeah, I think the program called TRid or something does that - someone posted that not that long ago. Google for that program and see what you come up with.

Apart from that, the best you would be able to do it search at like [http://www.fileext.com](http://www.fileext.com) or something for the extension of the file - it isn't the header of the file but it is the best there is that I know of.

Yes, TrID scans the first 2k of a file, comparing it with known headers, and is very useful for figuring out what to use to open a given file. Here's a link:

Best of all, it allows you to make your own definitions for your files! But if you want to submit them, you currently have to manually email Marko (the owner)...

It's a piggyback plugin with our dear friend Elbereth's Dragon Unpacker.  Not sure if it comes separately or if there is an equivelant plugin on sourceforge for the MultiEx.

Wait a sec, wait a sec.... You mean ALL THIS TIME I tried to access the 'archives' of my game, and they may not have been archives at all, but files withen files? I thought thats what an archive IS....

Oh man I am confused now...

I mean they are files called .dat (if that is what contains most of the data for my game, I'm not 100% certain), but I know they have to have different stuff in each one, and I have no idea what.  So am I trying to do the wrong thing?

Oh dear, someones got to help me even know what to look for and how to go about opening it! lol
