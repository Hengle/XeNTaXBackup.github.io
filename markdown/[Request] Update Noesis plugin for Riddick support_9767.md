- Post Title: [Request] Update Noesis plugin for Riddick support

This thread is made to ask for help in updating the plugin chrrox created for Syndicate to also support models from The Chronicle of Riddick - Assault on Dark Athena. Both games have models in xmd and textures in xtc from the same developer. All that is needed is an update to the script to load the proper UVs for the Riddick models. 

The original plugin is found in this thread: [viewtopic.php?f=16&t=9121](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=9121)

Here are some screenshots of how the plugin currently works. The first picture is taken from Noesis with the model loading perfectly well. The second shot is extraction of the textures in Dragon Unpacker. The third shot shows the problem with the UV map when I apply the texture to the model.

Any help would much appreciated. There are many great models in this Riddick game. Thanks for reading.
