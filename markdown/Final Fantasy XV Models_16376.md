- Post Title: Final Fantasy XV Models

It has come to my attention that it is in fact possible to rip models from FFXV, however those that have never give any kind of tutorial on how to do so which makes it impossible for anyone who has bought the game legally and would like to use the models for artwork purposes. It's especially frustrating to 3D artists like myself that are legitimately interested in using the game models but have no outside connections to porters/their scripts or do not have the ability to port models themselves due to lack of knowledge/experience. Not everyone uses models for obscene or grotesque content and those that respect the moral boundaries of the game's creators should be given a chance to use the models instead of being denied without actually having done anything wrong. I respect those that would like to keep models from being used in negative ways such as for profit or for porn, but it's also important to give those that haven't used game models in a negative way a chance to make beautiful artwork with said models. 

Important: This post is not meant to offend or single any one particular person out, but is instead here to encourage 3D artists to speak up for themselves if they feel they don't have a say in the modelling community.

I do not know what to say.
Could you explain more briefly?
Sorry I'm not Native English

Also a 3D Artist here, professionally, I use a lot of the models here to learn neat tricks and to see how studios did certain things.

That said, FFXV, is a game I'm quite interested in, but I don't think anyones going to be sharing how they hacked the disk, my understanding is that it was dumped by a particular person on another forum, to a small number of users, and then the files were edited and supported by Noesis, but the tools, the dumping and how to extract whatever archives haven't yet been made public, and I don't see it happening in the near future either sadly.

The rest of us willl have to wait and see if the game gets a PC release or not.

It affects my own personal projects but has no influence on my actual job (given that some games here are rips of games from companies I've worked for both in and outside of Japan).

I'm confused as to why FFXV model support was added to the latest version of Noesis for public use if there is no way to get the decrypted files from the game disk. If the method won't be released publically at all, hopefully a PC port of the game will come soon.

Sorry about that. In short, FFXV model support was added to the latest version of Noesis for public use but there's no way to get the decrypted files from the PS4/Xbox One game disk. Some have managed to extract the models but haven't shared how they actually ported them.

Hmm I can't say, but I think Rich Whitehouse (creator of Noesis) just wanted to share his work with a few particular people and just made it public, he's proud (rightfully so) of implementing the models and he found it really interesting. If other people learn how to dump the game correctly then they can use the tool, he just isn't explaining that part because thats not the part noesis is relevant to. There is a way, we just don't know how.

I will not make guesses on the reasons why data is still held secret, but what I'm sure of, this makes this content very rare and wanted. And as long as they're hiding it in secret, it becomes more and more possible that some people are selling this content for money, to the people who make porn and sell it for money.

You make it sound like you are somehow owed access to these models. But you're not, nobody is. If people want to share their extraction techniques, they are more than welcome to (that's the point of this whole forum). But if they don't want to, they don't have to.

And this one statement: "those that have never give any kind of tutorial on how to do so which makes it impossible for anyone ..."

This isn't true. You just need to figure it out for yourself. I understand your frustration, but nothing is stopping you. Nobody is preventing you from finding a way yourself.

I'll tell you a secret. 10 years ago, I knew absolutely nothing about ripping game models. And yes, often I saw people who figured out how and never explained. So I didn't complain about it. I started learning how to do it myself. It didn't happen overnight, it's true. But these days I can say about 90% of the time I can figure it out on my own (and most of the other 10% I blame on Megatextures   )

If the game is on PS4 (and I have a strong idea it is), then yeah, nobody is ever going to explain how it's done. Because the second they do, Sony is going to find out and patch it so it doesn't work anymore. That's just how it is.

I think you misunderstood my point for posting this thread. I'm not forcing anyone to share the models or the extraction technique. I just thought that if there were any 3D artists out there that felt the same way as me that they could say so here. Also if anyone felt like sharing anything, they could just post it here as well. The thread is open to anyone who is interested. I actually do know something about ripping models, because I've ripped from PC games but never from console...
I decided to post this since I've seen others frustrated by the lack of knowledge out there on the internet from ripping from this game as well. The post was not meant to offend anyone in any way. And in regards to your last statement, there is such a thing a private messaging. (not to be rude by saying this, just stating a fact)

There is a way, we just don't know how.

Also, you mention a lot about 'respectful 3D artists', but, who defines that really? Nobody posts here and says 'I wanna use this games models for 3D Porn' they just sometimes do, sure its weird but its something some people apparently enjoy.

Atop that, if you're a 3D Artist, why would you do anything with the models other than learn from them?You wouldn't be using them in portfolios and so on anyway.

Actually, I heard somewhere else shortly after replying that he might have gotten the decrypted files from someone else. 
I saw others asking why FFXV support was added when there was no public method for dumping the files on the game disk and it made me curious as well. At the time I replied, I wasn't aware that he might have gotten the files from someone else...And some people actually do say outright that they use game models for NSFW works. Honestly, those kinds of people who sell the models for profit or use them for stuff like that ruin the chances of anyone being able to use ported game models, because porters are fed up with people like that. Respectful 3D artists are those that don't break porters rules or if they port the models themselves they don't use them for negative content. I am a 3D artist (like I mentioned in the post) and If the models are ever released to the public, I would just use them for making artworks.

I don't mean any hard feelings about anything I said in my post, just sharing my own feelings about this issue and if anyone else feels the same they are free to say so here as well.

The files weren't edited, so once a means of simply decrypting pkg+PFS becomes public, the files should work out of the box with Noesis. No one wants to release that information because:

1) Sony would murder whoever made it public. I would never go public with something like this, as it could have negative consequences to my career.
2) It requires a working 4.x kernel exploit. (in absence of keys, but even with the raw keys, some amount of further reverse engineering would likely need to be done to determine the hoops you need to jump through to apply/derive the keys) Not many people have the knowledge, and of those that do, even fewer have the time to go hunting for a viable kernel exploit, even though much of what you need to decrypt data once you've achieved kernel-level code execution is already semi-public.

Those that are in possession of working exploits also seem to be holding onto them rather tightly with the justification that the exploit will be fixed as soon as it goes public. I don't personally agree with this justification, but I could see a moral justification there in that making this information public would quickly lead to piracy through a variety of means, including the ability to execute both decrypted commercial and unsigned titles on the platform. Again, most people would not be willing to open these floodgates to the public.

It's also my policy across the board to not actually distribute copyrighted content. That would just be setting myself up for legal action, and put Noesis itself at risk, so I'm not going to send anyone game data. You'll just have to wait until a means of decrypting the content yourself becomes available. There are certainly plenty of models out there for you to "learn" from in the meantime!

Thank you so much for the reply! I think I understand the situation much better now. Hopefully the models will be released somewhere online at some point in the future or until I could find a way to extract them myself.

Already some well-known people have succeeded in extracting models from ps4 games

FF15 already has a test version of pc and it will be released soon
Try to stay for a few months.

To be honest, I'm kinda deceived and worried as well concerning this situation.

I am not a really good 3D Artist, neither a good animator, I need to learn so much about how to make decent animations, and more importantly, make them look somehow realistic, and Neither I have the tools to MOCAP. but I love using the ripped models from some games, specially the ones that comes rigged already.
to be more precise, The animal/creature/monster models.

FFXV was just another of those games where models I'm interested on ripping, and I loved how someone managed to get them.
but sadly, I know nothing about programing, neither scripting, I born on the 80s and all the knowledge I gathered was just only on GWBasic, and I neither know
the version I'm using, I think it was the first one from MS-DOS.

all the most important knowledge I had about Basic is gone, just I know the simplest of coding like this:

10 CLS
20 PRINT "Hello World"
30 GOTO 10

simple huh? and I don't think that this simple code can be useful to decrypt FFXV models. isn't it?

I tried to ask for help in some specialized pages where dataminers gathered, and I found only three pages.

"The Models Resource", "Facepunch" and this one.

the first one is filled by a buncha jerks, at first it was peacefully until that goddamn day, someone decided to take a 9 month hiatus. The one who had to be sentenced to die in the bonfire, like the inquisition did to witches centuries ago. or else, cut his head off like during the french revolution.

RTB, The one who can't explain a shit about where he did go, and why he had to take too much time for a fucking Bunnelby model he was in charge of editing.
He took too much time, and I had to rip the model myself, without even fixing the problems it has like the iris texture or the separated mesh parts whatsoever.
and once I had to finish the worst quality model of that stupid rabbit, he trolled me uploading the Bunnelby Model just after I comented that I did the animation, and how it took me the entire night without sleeping just for that.   

Results?... Rep -12 and that Dick for brains still don't explain himself why he had to be busy, and if he had to focus on other game models... I only asked... What the fuck is the game that deserved too much attention than Pokémon? He didn't answered the question.

And in Facepunch, there was people who wanted so badly the models of FFXV, and I just joined with them. but of course. another wild dick for brains appeared out of nowhere just to do the fucking drama and shut me the fuck up... Like I should care of Derps, Jerks and freakazoids who just yells me and orders me to SHARE.

Like I said, I am not that good at ripping stuff. and if I were able to, all the models I found so far, have problems with their goddamn textures. Examples like this
are found almost all the time when I finally get the model.

-3D Model of Tutomon obtained from Digimon Universe Applimonsters-
[https://photos.google.com/photo/AF1QipO ... DEEyBrVBGF](https://photos.google.com/photo/AF1QipOAF7IWn-4eFAIIIN_hI3SM7cwT1SDEEyBrVBGF)

Dammit... I cannot put the image in the message. You have no choice but to click in the link to see it.    

Do you really think I should share stuff like this just for some crappy FFXV models that perhaps I will never get?
To be really honest, I grew tired of those comunities.

I tried to do this the polite way, but if someone starts messing with me, I have no choice but to teach that fool a lesson or two.
I am too old to just mess up with models that neither have ALL textures, or try to wield the separated vertexes/vertices just to discover those unwielded when passing from 3DS Max to Cinema 4D. or having to do the rigging myself, and having to weight over 1000 vertexes, just to find out the model have issues on the
rigged parts. if I where to do all of this shit alone, then I quit. Simply.... I QUIT!!!!!

This is the last comunity I would ever want to come, since you focused on PC/console Games but never took care of Nintendo consoles like 3DS or Wii, Wii-u or Switch. The only one who lastly managed to get models from 3DS, was Maybeepah with KH DDD, and he's gone, when he told to this comunity that he will give us rigged models of all characters/NPC/Enemies/Dream Eaters.

on TMR... That jerk of RTB... the only one who could made the pokémon models perfectly, looking without texture problems, without unwielded parts, and
so easy to do Nurbs without converting the model itself into editable poly on 3DS Max (destroying the rigging), and wielding the vertexes.
is gone for good, and yet Pokemon Ultrasun and Ultramoon are coming soon. so... What do I have to think about this?

me as a 3D Artist I am deceived of how all datamining/3D Artist comunities are going.
People who wants to keep their secret sealed by not allowing us to get access to a folder with all the models ripped so far.
People who disappears for over 9 months without saying a fucking word and when one wants to know what the heck happened, I got assaulted by disrespectful shit eating jerks and cock sucking whores.
People who places rules that scares the shit out of me when I wanted to upload some files into this comunity to get a chance to finally rip the models and adding
the format support to a Noesis update.

So... I have just 3 words to Rich Witehouse and those fools who don't understand the situation.

"Sharing is caring"

This is why the internet in general lacks in content I were searching for ages, and yet I am searching for that stuff with no avail. 
I have a long story to explain about that and I cannot, but to briefly explain... I became a 3D Artist to make that content, Real Life will never provide me
the content I'm searching and the best era of internet was on 2006, when Youtube existed to fill videos of kitties and doggies, and "paw licking" were the keywords to see those creatures grooming themselves. I will not find the animals licking their paws on the fucktube, I just make MY creature models to lick their paws... All my animal models exists only for that purpose. to compensate 11 years of not finding stuff like it should be due to Youtube's fall to decline, That's all.

You aren't entitled to anything that people have and it's their choice to distribute. You also aren't entitled for reasons why people leave for a long time, even though that has nothing to do with this subject, their life is their life and they may want to keep it private. The reasoning behind the method/files not being distributed has already been explained so there was no need to bring the situation back up.

30 GOTO 10

simple huh? and I don't think that this simple code can be useful to decrypt FFXV models. isn't it?

I tried to ask for help in some specialized pages where dataminers gathered, and I found only three pages.

"The Models Resource", "Facepunch" and this one.

the first one is filled by a buncha jerks, at first it was peacefully until that goddamn day, someone decided to take a 9 month hiatus. The one who had to be sentenced to die in the bonfire, like the inquisition did to witches centuries ago. or else, cut his head off like during the french revolution.

RTB, The one who can't explain a shit about where he did go, and why he had to take too much time for a fucking Bunnelby model he was in charge of editing.
He took too much time, and I had to rip the model myself, without even fixing the problems it has like the iris texture or the separated mesh parts whatsoever.
and once I had to finish the worst quality model of that stupid rabbit, he trolled me uploading the Bunnelby Model just after I comented that I did the animation, and how it took me the entire night without sleeping just for that.   

Results?... Rep -12 and that Dick for brains still don't explain himself why he had to be busy, and if he had to focus on other game models... I only asked... What the fuck is the game that deserved too much attention than Pokémon? He didn't answered the question.

And in Facepunch, there was people who wanted so badly the models of FFXV, and I just joined with them. but of course. another wild dick for brains appeared out of nowhere just to do the fucking drama and shut me the fuck up... Like I should care of Derps, Jerks and freakazoids who just yells me and orders me to SHARE.

Like I said, I am not that good at ripping stuff. and if I were able to, all the models I found so far, have problems with their goddamn textures. Examples like this
are found almost all the time when I finally get the model.

-3D Model of Tutomon obtained from Digimon Universe Applimonsters-

Dammit... I cannot put the image in the message. You have no choice but to click in the link to see it.    

Do you really think I should share stuff like this just for some crappy FFXV models that perhaps I will never get?
To be really honest, I grew tired of those comunities.

I tried to do this the polite way, but if someone starts messing with me, I have no choice but to teach that fool a lesson or two.
I am too old to just mess up with models that neither have ALL textures, or try to wield the separated vertexes/vertices just to discover those unwielded when passing from 3DS Max to Cinema 4D. or having to do the rigging myself, and having to weight over 1000 vertexes, just to find out the model have issues on the
rigged parts. if I where to do all of this shit alone, then I quit. Simply.... I QUIT!!!!!

This is the last comunity I would ever want to come, since you focused on PC/console Games but never took care of Nintendo consoles like 3DS or Wii, Wii-u or Switch. The only one who lastly managed to get models from 3DS, was Maybeepah with KH DDD, and he's gone, when he told to this comunity that he will give us rigged models of all characters/NPC/Enemies/Dream Eaters.

on TMR... That jerk of RTB... the only one who could made the pokémon models perfectly, looking without texture problems, without unwielded parts, and
so easy to do Nurbs without converting the model itself into editable poly on 3DS Max (destroying the rigging), and wielding the vertexes.
is gone for good, and yet Pokemon Ultrasun and Ultramoon are coming soon. so... What do I have to think about this?

me as a 3D Artist I am deceived of how all datamining/3D Artist comunities are going.
People who wants to keep their secret sealed by not allowing us to get access to a folder with all the models ripped so far.
People who disappears for over 9 months without saying a fucking word and when one wants to know what the heck happened, I got assaulted by disrespectful shit eating jerks and cock sucking whores.
People who places rules that scares the shit out of me when I wanted to upload some files into this comunity to get a chance to finally rip the models and adding
the format support to a Noesis update.

So... I have just 3 words to Rich Witehouse and those fools who don't understand the situation.

"Sharing is caring"

This is why the internet in general lacks in content I were searching for ages, and yet I am searching for that stuff with no avail. 
I have a long story to explain about that and I cannot, but to briefly explain... I became a 3D Artist to make that content, Real Life will never provide me
the content I'm searching and the best era of internet was on 2006, when Youtube existed to fill videos of kitties and doggies, and "paw licking" were the keywords to see those creatures grooming themselves. I will not find the animals licking their paws on the fucktube, I just make MY creature models to lick their paws... All my animal models exists only for that purpose. to compensate 11 years of not finding stuff like it should be due to Youtube's fall to decline, That's all.

Please to all users who care enough to even read a sliver of this bullcrap, ignore it. He was already banned from another site I'm apart of. Farlavor, get it through your thick skull that no one's going to "cater" to what you do. No one gives a damn, and no one ever will, especially with all the disrespect you give other people. Those "cock suckers" are right, because you're a disrespectful asshole. If you're going to keep carrying other site's drama, no one's going to want you around. So, if you have nothing nice to say, shut it and don't post at all. Otherwise, be respectful and maybe someone will answer you. If you're tired of these communities, then freakin leave, because you're not wanted here with your attitude anyway.

Get a grip. The world doesn't revolve around me, you, or anyone else for that matter.

Things take time to get done, and when they don't it's not because I'm "trolling", it's because (contrary to popular belief) my life consists of more than just sitting at my computer exporting 3D models and other stuff nobody cares about all day. I'm sure most people would agree that having the equivalent of a mid-life crisis (I'm not old enough for that yet) is a perfect reason to just take a break from the internet for several months and try to get things fixed up with my personal life. Even now things aren't all sunshine and rainbows for me. Heaven forbid I wanna try to enjoy what little I have left to enjoy at the moment.

So yeah, screw me for wasting your life waiting for me to extract that gawddamn Bunnelby model, right?

This is one of the reasons why the "sharing is caring" thing is a very old excuse now. Apart from all the legal and technical explanations given, it's exactly because of people like you if, in general, a lot of 3D content is kept locked and for private use. You have to understand that we're talking about copyrighted material, this reason alone is more than enough to not share in the first place. 

> "This is why the internet in general lacks in content I were searching for ages, and yet I am searching for that stuff with no avail."

If you are so eager to put your hands on the models, learn how to dump the files and leave the ones who even bothered to give a super valid explanation to justify (not that they needed to) the lack of download links alone.

Coming from the '80s doesn't mean you can't sit down and learn new stuff ya know.

If you define yourself as a 3D artist then you should know the ripped models will be useless to you. As someone already stated in a previous post, it's not like you can use this content for your professional portfolio. Also, acting butthurt and rude definitely will not give you what you expect to receive... learn to treat people like human beings and not robots who are good just to share models because you tell them to. Nobody has to say a word about their inactivity, they're not working for you.

Tabata explained that the demo ran at 4K using a GTX 1080 Ti card, but the minimum specifications will fall, at least, at the same level as the console version.
“But we’ve not fixed the frame rate at 30 frames at all – it’s just on the 1080 Ti, that’s the maximum that one can do [at 4K], so that’s what it’s doing at the moment.”

Now that FFXV is coming to pc along with mod support. I wonder if it will be possible to mod in the FFXIII Vs Noctis. since the model is on the disc.

I agree with you. Sure I get the stuff about not wanting PS to bugger up the porting system or not wanting to get sued, but there are easy ways around this, by just distributing the actual model data without the means to actually extract it, and do it on an anonymous connection, so they can't link it back to you. But having talked to one of the "individuals" who sits there smugly posting his FFXV character renders on DeviantArt without letting anyone else have a go, I think it's pretty clear that that MF just wants the smugness and glory of being the only one with proper FFXV character renders. I mean don't get me wrong, I get the stuff about porn and all that, but that's why I always do my underage models on a password-protected basis, so I can look at peoples' profiles and see if they are a creep or not before letting them access the model. Saying you're not going to let ANYONE download the models on any basis just because someone might use them for porn is IMO ridiculous.

But taking copyrighted models from Square Enix, making artwork with them and refusing to share them with anyone else like you actually own the fucking models is ok though?

You talk about hard work, but you've literally already done 99.9% of the effort. Literally all you need to do is just put a link up there, which requires absolutely no hard work at all. This comment is nothing more than an excuse for people who want to hog all the glory.

I really don't know why this is such a big deal. More people than one have the actual game files, simply no one decided to upload them yet for already explained and obvious reasons. But just because one of those uploads renders and shares the extractions with friends it's good to jump onto wild accusations apparently. Last time i checked no one claims any models as their own content, nor do any of them bathe in any glory. Accusing that would be like accusing MrAdults of the same just because he shows FFXV things render in Noesis.
Beyond Two Souls models were also private for a pretty long time in the past and hey i love that game and wanted them. Did i throw a tantrum? Not really, what would it help anyway. Others were simply lucky to have the content, it's not like i was entitled to have it just because i want it. And waiting paid off, now we can get those models.
Usually i tend to ignore things like this nowdays and writing this is probably a mistake, i'm sorry, but i'd just like to say that i think it's rather interesting how some here get bashful, even call others names and still expect them to do anything for them or even 'argue' with them. 

Most importantly though, sooner or later it'll all be public. Be it a public leak of the PS4 version or the PC version next year.

Dude, do you really think with that attitude you'll get somewhere? Looks like complaining on DeviantArt and being blocked for that is not enough, uh?

I'm not using any port for my profit and I basically stopped redistributing publicly. I always stated that I'm willing to take everything down should any developer come to my page and ask for it directly, so to me it's YOU the one who's trying to find any valid excuse to make us feel bad and guilty for keeping the models private just 'cause you want them. I never took credit for the models used in my artworks, but of course feel free to see only what you want to see.

And wow, talk about being lazy there!  So just because other people have ported a full model you shouldn't bother to even try? Just to be clear once and for all, we owe you butthurt people NOTHING. This stupid drama about lack of downloads is ridiculous, especially considering we are talking about games, 3D models and hobbies. The reasons for not sharing have been explained in the previous page and if you cannot read, hey, not my fault (oh and spare me the "use a password" suggestion, that ain't gonna work. There will always be some user willing to spread the password via private messages or comments, so you can't really convince me this method is safe).

The PC version will be out next year, which is not that far away. So just be patient and wait for it, then you will be able to get whatever you like from FFXV. As Crofty said, I've been looking for certain models for YEARS and nobody ever released them. I never insulted the ones who got them, nor I bothered to comment under their posts saying how shitty their excuse was. And since you really don't want to understand, this is not even an excuse but a simple decision, which is tied to legal and moral reasons. Stop wasting your time trying to put yourself above us because "bruh you are working with copyrighted content anyway so you have to share". That is exactly why we are not sharing in the first place, DUH. And anyway it is not your right to decide for our actions.

(Also it's funny how you quoted my last block of text and commented with something totally irrelevant)

Bye! :*

Agreed.

I want the models as much as anyone else, but actually I'm only interested in the environments, not the characters or monsters at all.

Are those files also accessible or is it only the characters that're accessible at the moment?

Hello every one. Just you to know, I'm also a fan of FFXV. I've tried to find some models, but when I saw some, I've being rejected and little jealous when I asked them. So I was thinking, I want that models too and new start for it. Because I'm 3D Artist like the rest of you. So that's why, I'm not making profits, I just want some inspiration and imaginative and if someone lend me a hand, I would be honored  
.

Like the rest of you, I agree with your decision, I'm not using models for ridiculous stuff and keeping private from those who intended to misuse it.

Can a mod please lock this topic, its not productive, people are just being petty and inventing reasons for using the models.

It doesn't matter what the models are for or who's using them, they aren't going to be released.

The Episode Duscae skeletons are a bit strange, but I managed to import those samples.
I had to use  daemon1's Raw texture previewer/converter for the textures since nothing else worked.

I have to do some testing to see if I broke anything with the full game.

I checked the Noesis changelog and Mr. A added support for the Windows BTEX files.
So now it supports all of them.

Anyway, this isn't as good as Noesis, but it works with the above Duscae files and the few files I've tried from the full game.
