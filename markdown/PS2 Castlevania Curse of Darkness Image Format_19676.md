- Post Title: PS2 Castlevania Curse of Darkness Image Format

Hello, I don't have much experience in PS2 graphic formats but I manage to get this form the game, is inside a big BIN file.
I can see it, but not quite well in Tile Molester with 32bpp but the palette is wrong.
Here is the sample:
[http://www.mediafire.com/file/d97pckra8 ... wImage.bin](http://www.mediafire.com/file/d97pckra87dcgev/RawImage.bin)
Is the Red Konami logo.
Thank you.

Thank you so much for the script, it looks perfect, now I need to study how it works in order to replace textures and read them correctly, I'm making a bestiary editor for the game, that is why I'm looking at how the game store images, good thing that the data is uncompressed, Konami love to use compression most of the time.

Hi! Can you post your script again, please? It doesn't exist anymore...
