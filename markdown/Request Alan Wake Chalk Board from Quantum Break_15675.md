- Post Title: Request: Alan Wake Chalk Board from Quantum Break

Hey there,

I noticed the archive post regarding Quantum Break is pretty dead, but I was wondering if someone can help me figure out how the chalk boards are made?

I've gone through a ton of the textures and couldn't find the texture for that first Alan Wake easter egg, I'd really like to see it in full quality.

The concern I have is that it might actually not just be a normal texture - I'm currently figuring it's actually a model with some other things going on.

there's like 52000 files. Any help or insight would be greatly appreciated!
