- Post Title: Observation text files

Hi how are you? what's up?

I wanted to ask you if I want to extract Observation game subtitle files.
And as you know, the game files are in .dat format and I want to extract the game text from these files and translate it into my own language and add it to the game again. Can you tell me how I can extract the game text from these files? ? With what software?

Hello everyone, I wanted to say that I tried to extract the text of this game to translate it into my own language. But my problem is that the text files of this game are in a format that I have never worked with such files.
The format of these files is: .dat
If anyone can help me, tell me what I should do to extract them.

These files are XML files that have been encrypted via a simple XOR cipher. This cipher is symmetric so the same process can be used to re-encrypt them once edited.

```
{
    for (int i = 0; i < bytes.Length; i++)
    {
        bytes[i] = ~(bytes[i] ^ 0x41);
    }
}

```
