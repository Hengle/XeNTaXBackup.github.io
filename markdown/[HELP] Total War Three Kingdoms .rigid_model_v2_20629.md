The game uses the same TW3 engine as WH2 but has been upgraded so the old plugins can't used. Can anyone help me?

No .anim sample, so no skin and bones. But here's the script

The script works very fine. Is there any chance to export back .rigid_model_v2 format?

It's possible, format isn't hard, but I'm not planning to do it (due to several reasons). I really want to make models import with bones and weights, it's also not hard, so I will do it when I will have free time and opportunity!

i think back-importing to the game will be possible when the official Modding Tools out there, but just like in the past years, you will need a 3D program ( probably 3DS Max, as before). And What the Developers never provided in all the years, was Import-Tools, so its great to have that script

As Leo73 said, we can wait until the official mod tool is released, but it will probably take a long time, and I want to create some mod for the community. Anyway, thank you so much for the great script.

The official mod tools are released, but i think there is again no tool or script in this pack to import 3d models into a 3d program. Today i hope i get the chance to test Zaramots script on several models

No model import?! In official mod tools? Lol, guys who could tell me what exactly this "mod tools" are doing? Is there any export option or maybe with this tool you could inject .fbx files like witcher 3 modding tool are doing?

P.S. I made an update to import models with bones and weights, going to post it later if there's no import option or model converter for this game atm.

there are Maya_Exporter and 3dsMax_Exporter, but as far as i know they export models from maya or max, and thats all. Then there are some example models we can import to have a skeleton etc., but for characters we only have two of those examples unfortunately. The Modding Tools are for database editing, unit variation editing, map editing and what-not, even model importing to the game, but no model import to a 3D program except of the very few example files.

now i tested some models and for characters the script works like a charm =) 

then i tested the script for ships and buildings, and both do not work unfortunately. Do you plan to add support for them too?

For anyone interested: Ultimate Unwrap 3D with the etw plugin works perfectly nice with Three Kingdoms-models. This way we also can import Buildings and Ships to a 3D program. 

Nevertheless i would like to say thank you to Zaramot for his efforts and his script.

Okay, I'll check model sample from above. Also, guys upload ships and buildings somewhere - I'll take a look too, I guess they shouldn't be hard to get.

@zaramot 

have you continued to working on the script? 
I for one would be interested in rigged models with bones and weights from Three Kingdoms plus the animations, being able to import them to 3ds Max would be amazing.
