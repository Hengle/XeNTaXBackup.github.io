- Post Title: [HELP] Obscure 2 .hvp tool

I'm trying to extract Obscure 1 and 2's .hvp files with Game Extractor looking for values such as HP and speed.
More specifically, for Obscure 1 I can't seem to find the playable characters' speed values while for Obscure 2 I apparently don't have the correct plugins in the first place.
There are some posts about the Obscure games on this forum but all the links are dead.

about obscure 1, you can use this tool to unpack hvp archive (source included) (no repack feature, but you don't need it, game can load data outside of hvp archive.)
and about obscure 2, i remember i see a tool for it in some old post in this forum, but i don't know where... search you can find it

Hi! Sorry for the noob question but what exactly do you mean by samples?
I'm trying to attach some of the files I found but the site won't allow me because of "Invalid file extension".

I already have that tool for Obscure 1 luckily.
Unfortunately, as I originally stated, all the links for Obscure 2 tools are dead, all of them.

I forgot to mention that I also attempted to extract the iso (ps2 version) of Obscure 2 but it prompts an error (attached below) saying I need to download QuickBMS despite it literally being enabled in the plugins list, so that's great :/
I also attempted to use AFSExplorer since I used it in the past for other ps2 isos but it crashes with this game so that's also extremely jolly.

You can extract PS2 ISO files with Apache2 tool.

I meant uploading sample archive files to services like Mega, Google drive etc.

I don't understand. I already saw that post but there's nothing attached anymore.

Edit: Oh my god, I can't believe it. The problem is that I browsed some of these posts with my phone without logging in so that's why the attachments are hidden.
Thanks for being thorough and sorry for my clumsiness. 

Anyway, I downloaded the tool and tried to open Obscure 2's .hvp files but it wouldn't run. I wonder if I am missing something, which is probably the case since this is my first time looking into game files.

Yeah sorry, I didn't realize I wasn't logged in while browsing with my phone, I'm really embarrassed about that.

Anyway, I also tried apache2 and I managed to extract Obscure 2's ISO (yay!) but unfortunately that's when I also realized I still couldn't open the hvp files anyway (boo!).

Since for whatever reason quickbms isn't working with Game Extractor I decided to use it by itself thanks to the script contained in this post:
[viewtopic.php?t=13364](https://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?t=13364)

Unfortunately though, it extracted the files without their original titles or extensions, just numbers.
There's another post with no replies complaining about the same problem:
[viewtopic.php?t=17001](https://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?t=17001)

Worst case scenario, since I am looking for text files (I think), I could just check all files one by one with Notepad but definitely not now that I am at uni.

Once I get my hands back on my PC tonight, I will also see if I can upload some sample files as you asked. 
I've never done that before so I will have to look into how to do it.

Is there anything specific you need? There's plenty of different types of files to choose.

```
Option:
/e - expand files
/p - group files

put hvptool.exe and your hvp into one folder
open commend line and move to that folder and use this commend to unpack it

```
hvptool.exe /e YourFile.hvp a_output_folder
```

you doing it all the way wrong
first of all why hvptool.exe is 0 byte 

follow this step
click in The part I specified in bottom photo and type cmd and hit enter its open a cmd window in this folder
[](https://ibb.co/9btBxgV)

then type following code in commend line

```
obscure.hvptool.exe /e YourFile.hvp a_output_folder
```

obscure.hvptool.exe is main program to unpack HVP files
/e tell the program you want to unpack archive
YourFile.hvp is hvp archive name you want to unpack (change it with your archive name)
a_output_folder is the folder you want to program unpack files to it (also change to exiting folder)

after that hit enter, program start unpack

if you download files from official site there is no way to get virus
you can download quickbms from [https://aluigi.altervista.org/](https://aluigi.altervista.org/)
and for Hex editor you can download HxD, its freeware (or others...)

Sorry for the lack of updates, I've been pretty busy recently.

So about Obscure 1...
I finally figured out how to upload on MEGA:
[https://mega.nz/folder/lg0FSCxY#Zbfb1fvdG243IoDsebW-uw](https://mega.nz/folder/lg0FSCxY#Zbfb1fvdG243IoDsebW-uw)

These files are what I'm looking for in the game, basically just numerical values.
Unfortunately, the data is incomplete, since I am still looking for the playable characters (and maybe also the enemy's) movement speed since they each move at different speeds.
All the other files seem to be about textures, animations, sounds, etc. but I don't care about that, at least not at the moment, so I really wish I knew where to look.
I'll upload all the extracted files when my connection speed gets better (there's a storm rn :/).

For Obscure 2...
So if I get it right, an unpacker is needed to get the file names and extensions, right?
That's kind of a bummer, I took a quick glance on the forum posts again and I don't think I saw one.
Any clues where or who could I ask about that?
Because if it's really necessary then Obscure 2's files are basically off limits for me, unfortunately.

On the bright side though, I could probably actually do without them since:
1) I don't care about Obscure 2 as much Obscure 1.
2) A lot of mechanics and animations are recycled from Obscure 1 so , what I find out about that game applies to the sequel.
3) Its mechanics are streamlined compared to the prequel (I could probably just reverse engineer values with Cheat Engine, honestly).

Thanks for your patience and support, I hope we can get to the bottom of this.

Alright here's the extracted Obscure 1 hvp files (pc non-steam version):
[https://mega.nz/folder/ks9k3Aga#QqKY3bhixtMhS7DYqzwOmA](https://mega.nz/folder/ks9k3Aga#QqKY3bhixtMhS7DYqzwOmA)

There's 3 hvp files:
-strmpack is stuff concerning cinematics and dialogues.
-datacach contains model related stuff such as textures.
-datapack contains a bit of everything, I presume it's mostly stuff that makes the game work therefore this is the folder I'm interested in since it's where I found the text files with detailed stats about the game's enemies and weapons that helped me understand how damage is calculated. (I did some testing with Cheat Engine beforehand but some of the numbers I found didn't make sense until I read the documents)

I'm suspecting that what I'm looking for is probably in the _levels folder since the text documents seem to contain some sort of scripts to look for the player's coordinates and speed but I'm not sure what the right program to read them is.

In case it might be useful here's also the Obscure 2's unectracted hvp files (pc steam version):
[https://mega.nz/folder/x49Q1DxD#hDqclijhmJqWm8gxaXc0Sw](https://mega.nz/folder/x49Q1DxD#hDqclijhmJqWm8gxaXc0Sw)

I presume it works mostly the same.
Even though I stated in the previous post that I could live without Ob 2's files, I would still enjoy browsing through them to get some accurate values.
There's a couple of weapons in the game that inflict damage over time (tazers, chainsaws, flare guns, etc.) and they're kinda hard to measure accurately with Cheat Engine.

Hi
How to get models from this game:
1.make new folder - "DATAPACK"
2.copy file "DATAPACK.hvp" to new folder "DATAPACK"
3.unpack "DATAPACK.hvp" from folder "DATAPACK" with quickbms, use script
Code: Select all#obscure 2
comtype lzo1x
get unk1 long
get unk2 long
get FILES long
get unk3 long
get unk4 long
for i = 0 < FILES
	get type long
	get unk long
	get size long
	get offset long
	get zsize long
	get unk long
    math C = i
	set NAME string C
	if type == 1
		clog NAME offset zsize size
	endif	
	if type == 0
		log NAME offset size
	endif	
next i
4.instal Blender 249 and Python 266
4.unpack blend importer and copy all files  to folder where is blender.exe
5.doubleclick Blender249.blend
6.in Blender Text Window press alt+p and select "DATAPACK.hvp" from folder "DATAPACK"
7.files are sorted in tree folder
8.one more time press alt+p and select file 102 from folder "0\1\10\100"
9.open "g2_body.image" from folder "0\1\10\100" in TextureFinder.exe and select pixel formats 565=16
10.save image as g2_body.bmp and move to folder "0\1\10\100\104"
11.repeat step 10 for all images .Some images have tga format, so don't need to convert (hair images)
12.one more time press alt+p and select file 105 from "0\1\10\100\104" and script import textured and skinned with bones model of girl

Importer works not for all files. Still in progress.
Some bones are scaled to 0 so please select armature and than select in 3d window "mode edit".

My research on HVP archives from Obscure 2 --> [viewtopic.php?p=188831#p188831](https://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?p=188831#p188831)
Links to extractor and file format are shared there. I hope that it will be helpful to someone.
