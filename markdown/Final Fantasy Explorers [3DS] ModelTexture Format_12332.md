- Post Title: Final Fantasy Explorers [3DS] Model/Texture Format

Hey Guys.

I've managed to extract files from the Final Fantasy Explorers Light 3DS Demo recently.

Heres a link to 2 of the files in dropbox: [https://www.dropbox.com/sh/azf19y7homu8 ... iT49a?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/azf19y7homu8qnj/AABY4IWVJBOJOQpvvwi5iT49a?dl=0)

The files themselves have no extention but the header for the format seems to be blz/darc

I can't say for sure if these contain models, textures or it could just simply be menu icons for all I know.

As I manage to open up more 3DS romfs.bin files and look at their insides I'll probably end up posting another thread or 2 in the next week or so.

Looking forward to discovering whats within these mysterious files.

There's a Fileformat that I want to unpack/repack.
[http://3dbrew.org/wiki/ARC](http://3dbrew.org/wiki/ARC)
I've uploaded such a file
The header is DARC

I also uploaded a Screenshot with much informations about this uploaded file.

Right now, there's only this viewer+exporter available for this file format, but not a unpacker/repacker or editor :/
It would be VERY useful if you can help me with this :>

EveryFileExplorer is able to let me VIEW files in the arc (darc) archives, but you're not able to edit/replace files inside of the archives yet. 
So EveryFileExplorer is useless for me right now.
