- Post Title: Magna Carta (PS2) --Model importer

I was looking for some 3d content import.. I unpack PS2 archive with content files, it was some Unreal engine modification...
I found this type of files
*.unr, *.uax, *.utx, *.usx, *.ukx, *.mes, *.anm, *.emi, .cam, .lpt, *.fld, *.fpd, *.efs, *.lkd, *.lvt, *.nod, *.gft, *.cht, *.pod, *.mon, *.dod, *.ecd, *.btw, *.uil

Link to archive
[http://www.speedyshare.com/files/232314 ... rchive.zip](http://www.speedyshare.com/files/23231445/Ship_Archive.zip)

P.S. A also found other two archives: 1- with Music, 2- without extension files, ?
