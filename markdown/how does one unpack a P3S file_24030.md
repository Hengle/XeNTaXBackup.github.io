- Post Title: how does one unpack a P3S file?

[https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zp61Rq ... sp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zp61RqfkBp4gCVc0uOs4EKeDZu0nj4t1/view?usp=sharing)

i'm honestly unsure what this file format is, all i know is it contains assets from Jurassic the Hunted (yes that game again, because I'm persistent)

the XML that accompanies the files lists what the P3S contains things like sounds, .ani files, textures, ect., but i don't know if the P3S file itself is unpackable with a pre-existing tool, or if a new one is required or what
