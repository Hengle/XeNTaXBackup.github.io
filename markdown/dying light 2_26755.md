- Post Title: dying light 2

Hello.... again
Today I'm here to inquire about language modding in dying light 2 game.
Because I have finished playing the first part and it supports my country language (Thai language)
So I started modding languages in dying light 2.
But I'm not smart enough to pry, detach or unpack it. I'm a bit confused by the files inside.
My point is I need a tool to mod or unzip the internal files to translate and pack it back in.
Thank you for wasting your time.
and sorry for my bad english
(This is why I want to mod it.)


you can Extract for look inside
