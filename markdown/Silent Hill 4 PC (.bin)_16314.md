Greetings everyone, Any chance anyone might be able to take a look at these .bin files and help me to extract the models? I know that there are tools for view them but it's not possible to extract meshes  

Here are some samples : [https://mega.nz/#!Z1VzXIrL!v93izxC1GTAG ... ns-octAK7Q](https://mega.nz/#!Z1VzXIrL!v93izxC1GTAGm65anpYo14SFQ07v9faWyns-octAK7Q)

Thanks in advance!
