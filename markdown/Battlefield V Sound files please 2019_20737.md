If you OWN the game, all you have to do is follow the example I posted in link above to get your extracted sounds
You need to fix your Google link no one can see it with out permission.

You need to edit your last post, and write in it if you missed something, your making a mess with all these spamming comments.

Also in link I posted above, there is just a tutorial and scripts to get extracted your needed files from the actual game, this forum is NOT a request forum for game assets of any kind.

STOP making one post after another, edit your last post and write in it, and do NOT PM me for stuff like this.
How about contact the person who posted that Google link with the audio files, NOT me.
