- Post Title: Fatal Frame: Maiden of Black Water .SED archive

Hello  

I've been searching everywhere for a solution to unpack the .SED archives found in the game files, particularly the one which appears to contain the sound effects for the camera obscura (WP_CAMERA0.SED). When opened with a hex editor, it seems like it may be of another format called WHD, but I didn't find anything for that either. Here's the beginning of the file:

I would appreciate any kind of help, and if you need more information just ask    Thanks in advance!
