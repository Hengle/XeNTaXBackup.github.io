Heya

I've seen parts of scripts and options to rip models/3d cars. But is there anything that can rip map?

Ideally looking for something like DXRipper where I can just get car in spot I like, rip it to fbx/obj/anything else + if possible textures but I want mainly meshes to analyze and tinker with.

Regards

Chips.
