- Post Title: Webbuilders needed!

Hiya all, 

The Xentax Foundation is looking for volunteers to join our team as webbuilders/coders. There are some interesting things to add and further enhance the site functionality wiith respect to content management, game research etc. However, current core members are swamped in other work and responsibilities. So we welcome any good php designer (or other) to join our ranks. Affiliation with game research, coding and cool stuff required . 

Note that income of our Foundation is low. Even though we have been hosting this site for ages now, we cough up most of the costs ourselves, as donations are rare. So at the moment, don't think you'll become rich.  You'll do it because you want to become famous in this community. 

Drop me an email, or post here if you want to offer your services  

Cheers, 
Mike

I'm kinda interested. I'm no web designer, but I'm competent with PHP (my website is full of random little apps, [http://lag.thps3.net](http://lag.thps3.net)), I've been hacking games as long as I've been programming (I also know Python and C and a bunch of other junk) - I wrote a script that would edit FF7, replacing enemies/items/spells with user-edited/scripted ones, extracted textures from Daggerfall, blah blah blah, you get it.

Nice. That sounds good and appropriate. 

Does it lie in your ability to create a content management system where people could upload/add their (game specific) tools and give descriptions, update it when needed etc? We need admins that have full rights, but anyone should be able to upload their tools (perhaps using PW and username from the forum?) and become the "owner" of the tool. A screenshot of the tool should also be possible to upload. Okay, so this is briefly just a brainwave.  Details can be discussed.

@quenombre: Thanks, I appreciate your suggestion (be it belately). However, I'm not 100% sure Word Press would suffice for what we'd like to do. 

@Agret: Nice! I'll contact you via gmail then!

On a completely unrelated matter, how do you get one of those nifty images with your email address on them? Do you create it yourself, or is there some online service somewhere? I've seen them before, but never really bothered to try and track one down.

Ok cool! I hope Andrew and you can work something out. Just let me know if you need something. I'll also talk to Andrew to see if we can get the idea right .

@Dinoguy, that service also allows you to save the image. Now we can only hope that this service does not sell it to spammers

Indeed. The ones I've seen previously, though, had colorized letters, so maybe there's more than one such service...

No doubt there are other services, I could put something like that together but I lack bandwidth and a server for it lol (plus im lazy) but it's not very difficult from a php point of view, just a few lines of GD related code.

I found that one the day before I volunteered while at school trying to help my friend put html into his gmail signature via a "gmail signature image" google search
