- Post Title: How to Open .CAB Files?

I recently downloaded this free online game and thought about ripping some of the graphics for my personal collection, but I have no idea how to open the game's .CAB files. Is there a simple program that allows me to extract stuff from this format? Any help would be appreciated.
