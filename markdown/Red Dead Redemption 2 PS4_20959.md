Red Dead Redemption 2 tool

Supports all skeletal & static models and textures. 







Character parts may be extracted one by one, or as predefined game combinations. For example, these are some different variations of Dutch:

That is amazing! I didn’t think it would be possible being such a recent PS4 release, but there it is. 

So much credit to all the hard work and time the excellent people put in to extracting the models from this game, great work. 

I have been waiting for these since the game was released back in 2018.  Is there any chance I would be able to have a copy of these files, who should I ask about them? I’m such a big fan of this game, I’d love to take a closer look at how the models are constructed and textured, and just to have the models would be amazing (particularly the Arthur Morgan model). Is there any chance of this at all?

Yes there is a chance. As far as I know, many people now have the files. If some of them will decide they can give them to you, they can do it.

Hi!

Congrats to daemon1, he seems to be the master at extracting files from all my favorite games.

Just wanted to see if someone would be willing to help with instructions on extracting models from RDR2 - or point me in the right direction?  
Do you have to have a jailbroke PS4 to extract files?  Is that the key?

I'm just a hobbyist.  Any help would be appreciated.

So I have to stop my efforts to extract models from RDR2? I wanted to make a Fan Game. I already have a map from GTA 5 and GTA 4, I also wanted RDR2... Maybe you know a way to extract models from RDR2 PC, where could I extract the map (even in pieces)?

Thats up to you. You can wait until someone will support PC, or go to RDR2 fans community and ask them for PS4 files, they have them all for a long time now.

Are you sure? Have you checked with the PC version? I still have RDR2 on PS4 but the digital version ... I prefer to work with the PC version. Could I get this tool somewhere to check?

Thanks for the tool.

I'm having an issue locating the PSINs - I managed to extract from metaped_fragments but nothing happens when I drop metapeds.rpf.  I've followed your .txt but I'm not getting the PSINs for some reason.

Any suggestions?  Has anyone else been able to get the PSINs?

So I think I got the files, psins, textures, metas, material list, but I ended up with an ascii file.  How do I open that?  It has data on it (5813kb)  Is this the model?  I can't import it into blender.  Is there a plugin for blender to import this?

I usually just wait for people who know better than me do this but no other models have come out.  Sorry, I'm seriously crawling through the mud with this.  If anyone can help me I would appreciate it.  Or maybe direct me where I should ask.

Thanks!

Hello. You said you got the files and textures. can you do a tutorial on that? I haven't had luck with this at all.

This might be blind leading the blind but I'll try  - here are the steps I used to get where I am currently.

EXTRACT : RPF's from the pkg file.
ADD : rdr2.exe / 002core_6_win64.dll / filenames.txt / meta_list.txt to folder
UNPACK : RPFs onto rdr2.exe to unpack - I did this one at a time and renamed the folder that was created each time.

I'll use the PACKS_0 as an example since that's where a lot of the model files are 

GO TO :  PACKS_0 > > BASE > MODELS  - Find a lot more RPFs
ADD : rdr2.exe / 002core_6_win64.dll / filenames.txt / meta_list.txt to folder
REPEAT : UNPACK : RPFs onto rdr2.exe to unpack - I did this one at a time and renamed the folder that was created each time.

Once these are extract you should have folders filled with META / TEXTURE / MODELPACK  files
Note : For TEXTURE files - I just again add rdr2.exe / 002core_6_win64.dll / filenames.txt / meta_list.txt to folder and unpack.  

GO TO : PACKS_0 > BASE > DATA > METAPEDS - these RPFs contain the PSIN files
ADD : rdr2.exe / 002core_6_win64.dll / filenames.txt / meta_list.txt to folder
REPEAT : UNPACK : RPFs onto rdr2.exe to unpack - again, I did this one at a time and renamed the folder that was created each time.
Note : Now you should have folders with PSIN files

CREATE :  Folder with rdr2.exe / 002core_6_win64.dll / filenames.txt / meta_list.txt

I'm going to use the cavehermit as an example since he didn't have too many files.

ADD : cs_CAVEHERMIT.PSIN and meta_base_CAVEHERMIT.META
UNPACK :  So I just selected both files and dropped them on rdr2.exe - this creates a PARTS folder with a cs_CAVEHERMIT_00.txt file inside.
MOVE : cs_CAVEHERMIT_00.txt file to where rdr2.exe is
ADD : cs_cavehermit_ms1_merge_2.MODELPACK file - I just did a search for CAVEHERMIT and located modelpack files.  I copy and paste those in the folder
UNPACK : cs_CAVEHERMIT_00.txt - this creates cs_CAVEHERMIT_00.ascii / cs_CAVEHERMIT_00_materials.txt

And this is where I'm at    

The materials.txt lists all the textures you need. I tried locating the modelpack files using this but it was hit and miss.

Anyway, maybe you can try it out and get further than me and share what you come up with.

Yeah, I've been trying to hunt one down.  The ones I've tried haven't worked for 3ds max and I can't seem to locate one for blender. 

Also, there might be an issue with the file.  I tried using a converter and it said something about not enough parameters.

Nice. So were you able to get meshes working in 3d application with textures? Can you post some previews? Thanks

Yes!  Finally.  I got Dutch extracted.  I'm not great with Blender, I did get the model in 3dsMax.  Some of the skin weights need to be messed with - his mouth doesn't open.  

I haven't messed with the textures but here it is rough -





Were you able to get the files?

Nice. I didnt have luck so I deleted My RDR2 Files . Looks like I need to get them back   
Do textures auto assign? What about environments? Can you post some environments (houses ....)?

The textures did not auto assign but you have the materials list to work from so it makes it easy to search for them.  I haven't tried environments.

Does anyone have a trick on extracting textures with larger file size?  Some of the ones I've been getting are tiny.  I figured out that straight extracting into the same folder overwrites them no matter size but even extracting separately and very slowly, I'm still only finding really small files for things like the weapon engraving textures.

Any help would be appreciated.

No, texture files NEVER get overwritten. If you get them small, it means they ARE small.
Or you're looking in wrong file or folder.

Are animations extractable (in a useable form) in this game? Or am I correct in thinking animations for Rockstar games such as gtav were never cracked?

I don't believe you can get animations.

this model also has modelpack data. They are usually called like "legs" or "arms". Here it was explained:

Not sure if anybody would be able to shed some light on this, but when I extract John, as in the epilogue model with the Player_Three.PSIN, no hair model is present.


Screenshot 2020-11-04 094019.png (207.12 KiB) Viewed 186 times

 (This can be said for all 31 of the model combination at present on the left.)

Unsure as to why this is happening, as no errors are thrown during the extraction process, and hair models have come out just fine for Dutch, young John, and Arthur. This also leads me to wonder if there is a .model file or a PSIN and META file that contains all the various hair lengths for both Arthur and John?

Anyhow, if somebody could help me understand why John's hair isn't being extracted, or tell me where else it may be located, that'd be greatly appreciated!

Sounds like you didn't include the hair modelpacks Here they are [http://www.mediafire.com/file/d3ofkz9re ... n.rar/file](http://www.mediafire.com/file/d3ofkz9remu3fjq/John+marston.rar/file)

See, that's what's confusing me atm, as I have a folder with all the .modelpack files (assuming that 2,516 is indeed all the ones that pertain to characters and wildlife) and I did the extraction process within that folder, which did indeed contain those hair model packs. Thus my confusion, as I don't encounter any errors with other characters when doing this.

I'd be curious to see if others get a different result, as it could be due to something on my end

Edit:
Come to think of it, there'd need to be some kind of player_three_hair.modelpack, similar to how there are various player_zero_hair.modelpack files for Arthur. As the three cs_johnmarston_ms1_hair.modelpack files reference the younger John and not the epilogue version.

I just re-dumped the metapeds, but I get no such modelpacks. So I am at a loss. Granted, John could share a hair model with another character, though, given my method with all the modelpacks in one place, I would've expected it to be picked up.

The reason for that to happen is because rockstar removed John's hair from the game. So now John shares Arthur's hair and doesn't have his own hair model.

Anyone figure out how to extract a single model from a modelpack?

I've followed the following instructions in the readme - 

3. to get ONE model exported:  rdr2 <modelpack> <meta>

But all I get is skeleton data with no mesh.

I'm trying to extract single hair meshes.

For anyone having the same issue.  I realized I needed to use the cmd prompt instead of dragging and dropping on the .exe

No, you can still drop files on the .exe
Just in this case its important that you select them in right order before you drop them

Yes!  Finally.  I got Dutch extracted.  I'm not great with Blender, I did get the model in 3dsMax.  Some of the skin weights need to be messed with - his mouth doesn't open.  

I haven't messed with the textures but here it is rough -

RDR2 Model Extraction
nightwolf1982

Step 1: Extract everything!!

Starting in the packs\base\data\metapeds folder:

Copy/extract rdr2.exe, oocore_6_win64.dll, and filenames.txt to this folder (these three files are critical).

Drag and drop each .rpf file onto rdr2.exe; this will extract the PSIN files we'll need.  I recommend collecting these files into their own base folder; this will make finding the PSIN files easier later on.

Next, open the packs\base\models folder.  Copy/extract rdr2.exe, oocore_6_win64.dll, and filenames.txt to this folder as well.  Every rpf file in this folder will need to be extracted, and since I'm not totally evil, here's the batch file command I used: 

	for %%G in ("*.rpf") do rdr2 %%G

Copy and paste this line into a blank txt file, then save it as a .bat

Whether by batch file or drag and drop, you'll end up with a large number of files including .meta files, .cloth files, .model files, .modelpack files, and a texture folder with .texture files.  Like the PSIN files, I recommend collecting each set of files into their own base folders: .meta files in one folder; .model and .modelpack files in one folder.  The .cloth files are for cloth simulation, so I don't think it's necessary to keep them.

Next, open the texture folder that was created in the last step.  Again, copy/extract rdr2.exe, oocore_6_win64.dll, and filenames.txt to this folder.  Yep, every file here has to be extracted as well; but I'm kind and will give you a batch command to make this easier:

	for %%G in ("*.texture") do rdr2 %%G

Copy and paste this line into a blank txt file, then save it as a .bat

Once more, collect these into their own base folder.

Step 2:  Now for the fun part!!

I recommend moving all of the base folders from step one into their own storage folder, like this (your names may vary):

RDR2\
     META\
     MODELS\
     PSIN\
     TEXTURES\

This way you have all of the original files to work with backed up in one location.

To start, you'll need a working folder for whatever character you're planning to extract; I'm extracting Abigail Roberts, so I created a WIP folder RDR2 Abigail.

Copy/extract rdr2.exe, oocore_6_win64.dll, and filenames.txt to this folder (They're back!!)

You'll also want a copy of cmd.exe in this folder, in order to execute the initial step.

It will also help to have a copy of meta_list.txt (should've come with the tool).

To start, you'll need to copy the .psin file and the .meta file for your character to the WIP folder; in this example, that would be CS_abigailroberts.psin and meta_base_abigailroberts.meta.

Open cmd.exe and enter rdr2 <psin> <meta> (where your character's psin filename replaces <psin> and the meta filename replaces <meta>  i.e. rdr2 CS_abigailroberts.psin meta_base_abigailroberts.meta)

This will create a parts folder with a number of text files.  Each of these text files is a different costume the character wears in the game.

To extract the models, you'll need to copy the character's .modelpack files to the WIP folder (in this example, it would be all of the modelpack files that start with cs_abigailroberts_fs1)

Copy the text files from the parts folder to the WIP folder, and then drag and drop each file onto rdr2.exe; this will create an .ascii file and a materials text file.

You can use the materials file to figure out which textures need to be copied over for each model.

Open the .ascii file in whatever program you use (mine are Noesis and Blender) and there you go, you should have the character model loaded up.

Hope this helps!!

So i'm having an issue with the ripping exe. I downloaded it and managed to rip a few models, textures and even full peds. However, out of absolute nowhere, the tool stopped working and i can't extract any ped anymore. I don't know wtf happened, i have all the ped's meta, psin, modelpack, texture and the .txt file from parts in the same folder but every time i try to drop the txt file onto the tool, nothing happens. I tried reinstalling the tool, deleted a lot of files, and i already tried to fix the issue various times but nothing. I already allowed the tool on windows defender too.

Any ideas wtf is the issue? Because for a whole day i was ripping full peds but now i can't rip any ped, only separate textures, rpf and .model.

My antivirus really doesn't like running the extraction tool. Is there a workaround? Better yet, I just need the default weapons from the game, does anyone have those already extracted?

Actually I dont need all the weapons; just the varmint rifle, bolt-action, carbine repeater, Evans repeater, M1899, and Double Action revolver. Or just some help with getting the extractor tool to not ping my antivirus. I'll be fine with either one.

Ok I fixed the previous issue, but I haven't noticed anything apparent after dropping an .rpf over the .exe. Does it just convert in the background? Does it dump the converted file in the same folder I have the .exe in?

Sorry about all the posts but I may have narrowed down the issue. After getting past the antivirus issue I get the message "Error: Windows cannot access the specified device, path, or file. You may not have the appropriate permission to access the item". I've tried all the solutions I've seen online, including checking the properties tab on rdr2.exe, redownloading the file, etc.

you need to read the message to the end. It must have the file name that the tool cannot access.

I've typed out the whole message, there isn't any more to it than that. I don't know what permissions I don't have, and I don't know what file name the tool can't access. I'm just following the directions of dragging and dropping packs_0.rpf on top of rdr2.exe.

I'm at a complete loss as to what I'm doing wrong. I have all the txt files and oo2core_6_win64.dll in the same folder as the tool. I've redownloaded both the tool and packs_0.rpf. I don't know what else to try.

if this is the whole message, then the problem is NOT the tool, but your windows system. I can't help you with that.

Ok, I finally figured out what the problem was; turns out I had a corrupted system file that needed repairing. As soon as I restarted, the tool worked great!

So I have a few questions about the readme since it seems to assume that you're assembling a humanoid model; since I'm only interested in weapons, do I only need to extract weapons.rpf? I can see there's model and texture files in there, I dont think any ammo is included in this folder, unless I'm mistaken. I also found a WEAPONS_PLAYER.rpf in the sfx folder; is this the sound files? When I tried unpacking it, the files in there had random names.

Just one more question: in blender, where do I add the textures to the model? I know there's a textures tab but I'm not sure what surface setting to use and which texture files go where. Like if I'm working with the carcano, I have w_rifle_carcano01_eg.dds, w_rifle_carcano01_pal.dds, w_rifle_carcano01_stock_eg.dds, and weapon_tint_wood.dds.

I think I figured out where to add the textures (for the most part... bit of a novice when it comes to texturing, I think I can identify normal maps but I haven't seen any metallics and rarely any base colors), but I'm looking at the materials list for each object and it mentions a bunch of materials that don't come with the weapon itself. Where can I find stuff like w_stock1_tintControl, w_stock_blank_nm, w_sharedStockCarvings1 etc? I tried unpacking the textures_0.rpf file but none of the files are given proper names. I would assume w_ files would be in the weapons rpf but I can't find them.

Hey all, so I'm attempting to use the rdr2 tool to extract a number of models and textures from rdr2, namely weapon and creature models, however, I've encountered some difficulty. When I place an rpf onto the tool such as "metapeds.rpf", I'm met with the error message, ".Unsupported enc cfg 8". I'd assume this is because I'm attempting to use the PC files on this tool rather than the ps4 files. If this is the case, where could I find the ps4 files/how could I extract models and textures from the PC files? Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Still need help figuring out textures. Am I supposed to find all the materials I need with each weapon.texture file? Because it seems like those only have normal maps and I'm missing stuff like metalics or anything else that will actually make the model look finished.

I don't remember where they are, but they must be somewhere.
Possible that some names are missing from filenames.txt - it was the file i created manually adding names,
so you can add it up, and try unpacking RPFs again to get them properly named.

I haven't been able to find a more complete list of filenames. Even tried using openIV to search the PC version, no luck so far. In the meantime, I do have a few questions about what I have been able to find; there's a wood_tint file included in a lot of these weapons, but I don't know how to use it because its not a base color file like I was expecting, so I don't know how to use it. Also, there's a materials list included with each weapon part, and they appear to reference files that I can't find anywhere in the filenames.txt. How will I know which files I actually need to form a completed texture? Also, the textures.rpf has a lot of unnamed files, but I don't know if this is the right place to look.

you can create it yourself. Just add the names you have from materials list to the filename list.

I finally located the missing textures! It was in the mess of randomly-named files I had when I unpacked the folder; thankfully they all have the correct names. So, final step is figuring out how this all works in blender. The part I'm most confused about is the wood_tint file; I can see that certain rows corespond to certain wood colors, including pearl, but I don't know how to use it appropriately. I'm assuming that I have to use more than one color? Or do I just pick one as my base color and then apply one of the tint controls to get my wood grain? Also, I still haven't figured out how to do metallic surfaces since normally those are grayscale. I tried asking some modding friends but none of them can figure out how RDR2's textures work.

your description is somewhat confusing.
If they are randomly-named files, how can they have correct names ?

The .texture files had random names (eg "0a2c39c4.texture"), after running them through the tool the resulting .dds files had readable names (eg "p_camerabox01x_ab.dds").

Still having trouble with applying the textures. I've had some other people who know textures better than I do look at them, and they can't figure out what to do with them. I can convert the dds files to pngs but that's about it. I need to figure out how to take all these tint controls and these cts and pals and egs and whatever, and turn them into base colors, normals and metallics. I saw earlier in the thread that I shouldnt be surprised if the textures are really small, but I'm worried it will still look pretty bad unless there's something I'm missing. 

I know that there are text lists that say which textures are to be used with each component, but that doesn't help me figure out how they're supposed to be used.

Hey all, I hope it isn't too late to ask this, but does anyone know where I can find the ps4 files for rdr2? I only own the pc version and thus haven't been able to use the tool to successfully extract any models. I heard that the files are distributed between friends and was wondering if anyone would mind sharing the files?.

That was the case when the console had the exploit private, once the hackers released the exploit publicly so did the files where made public, you can find them posted all over internet, filehost websites, torrents, you name it.

I've been looking around for quite some time on various websites, however, I haven't been able to find any of the files. If it's not too much to ask, could you point me to a specific site? )

No i cant do that, but if you google the name of the game plus fake pkg you will find tons of websites with what ever you need your looking for.

It's been a pain in the ass trying to just be able to rip models from RDR2. I went through the unreasonably long process of downloading and installing the PC version of the game, only to look for a method or tool afterward and find that none exists for the PC version, only for the PS4 version, so then I had to uninstall and find a pkg of the PS4 version (which wasn't too difficult, but had yet another long download time). 
Looked for the tool for a while, it was hard to find an actual link for it, had to use a different search engine because for some reason a few hide results that actually lead to what I was looking for. 
More pain after that, as it's impossible to find a download of this tool without having to create new accounts, the DLs on multiple file hosts have been removed, most don't give a reason, some say "inactivity", and some say it's a harmful file. 
Mediafire, for example, states "Dangerous File Blocked". 
I made an account at Psxhax to download the file there, but it won't download, browser says "Failed - Virus detected". 
For some reason, I wasn't able to find this thread until now despite looking on this site, when I found it I remembered I'd made an account here just in case, so I tried downloading the file here, but got the same result, "Failed - Virus detected". 
Checked my anti-virus and it said it was detecting something called "Trojan:Win32/Generic!rfn" which is apparently a severe threat.
Well, is this serious? Should I risk turning off my antivirus for this, or just give up? What's the deal with this file?
Is there anywhere I can find a DL for this tool that isn't malware? Or any other method to extract models from RDR2?
Thanks in advance.

It is a great forum we have here, no need to be sarcastic and rude. Continuation of this may result in bans being handed out.

What I don't understand: where's the problem to simply tell the young man that in this case he probably can ignore the virus warning?

He could run it inside a virtual machine or sandbox. This tool is quite impressive and I was able to extract a dog but the fur appeared to be missing. I've seen rips of animals from GTA V on deviant art and they also seem to lack the fur so I'm not sure if this is related to the tool or not. I'll have to look into trying a different ASCII importer/exporter.

Edit: I couldn't figure out how to get the fur on other animals or the neanderthal's clothing (44 preset). 
Also I've quoted the wrong guy, my bad shakotay.

It's been a pain in the ass trying to just be able to rip models from RDR2. I went through the unreasonably long process of downloading and installing the PC version of the game, only to look for a method or tool afterward and find that none exists for the PC version, only for the PS4 version, so then I had to uninstall and find a pkg of the PS4 version (which wasn't too difficult, but had yet another long download time). 
Looked for the tool for a while, it was hard to find an actual link for it, had to use a different search engine because for some reason a few hide results that actually lead to what I was looking for. 
More pain after that, as it's impossible to find a download of this tool without having to create new accounts, the DLs on multiple file hosts have been removed, most don't give a reason, some say "inactivity", and some say it's a harmful file. 
Mediafire, for example, states "Dangerous File Blocked". 
I made an account at Psxhax to download the file there, but it won't download, browser says "Failed - Virus detected". 
For some reason, I wasn't able to find this thread until now despite looking on this site, when I found it I remembered I'd made an account here just in case, so I tried downloading the file here, but got the same result, "Failed - Virus detected". 
Checked my anti-virus and it said it was detecting something called "Trojan:Win32/Generic!rfn" which is apparently a severe threat.
Well, is this serious? Should I risk turning off my antivirus for this, or just give up? What's the deal with this file?
Is there anywhere I can find a DL for this tool that isn't malware? Or any other method to extract models from RDR2?
Thanks in advance.

I got a virus warning too but its false positive.The owner of the tool has tons of helpful works and I've never seen a bad post about him, don't you think other people will complain like you if something is wrong?.It's up to you whether to use it or not.

I don't mean to bother anyone, but could someone please walk me through how to download and use the PKGEditor to extract the necessary files from the rdr2 pkg? I already have the pkg installed but I can't figure out how to extract anything from it or use the PKGEditor tool.

So I seem to have figured out how to get the ascii files and import them into Noesis, however, I noticed that all the models either have no skeleton at all or a very messed up one. Is this meant to happen or is there a way to get the proper bones?

Is there a way to match the hash codes from the parts text files to modelpack file names?  For example, match the hash code 79DF4CCE to the corresponding modelpack?

Does anyone know where the landscape and/or building models are located? So far I have only been able to find character models.

Hi! Could someone please explain how to get the weirdly neon colored rgb channel textures look normal?
I also for some reason can't open the dds files on any application.
Thanks in advance
