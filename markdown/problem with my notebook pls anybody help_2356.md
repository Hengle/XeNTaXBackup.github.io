- Post Title: problem with my notebook pls anybody help

Hello, 
I am having trouble with my Internet explorer.It is doing some very odd things.Sometimes it will completely close the page i am visiting for no reason or it will be very slow loading pages and when i say slow i mean very very very slow for eg i tried to google something and after 10 minutes of the page trying to load i gave up.I thought that it was perhaps the topic i was searching so i tried putting in random things to see if that made any difference but it didn't.Another problem i had was when i was on a forum and clicked on a link and nothing happened i tried to open a new tab and that wouldn't work either and it would let me access any options that are in my tools menu.i had to restart my computer.Just to let you know i have high speed Internet connection.Thanks in advance to anyone that helps me with this problem.

Sounds like you have a major spyware/adware infestation. Grab a couple of cleaner programs (a couple good ones are [Spybot - Search and Destroy](http://www.safer-networking.org/en/spybotsd/index.html) and [Adaware SE](http://www.download.com/Ad-Aware-SE-Personal-Edition/3000-8022_4-10045910.html?part=dl-ad-aware&subj=dl&tag=top5)) and run them, they'll probably find a huge number of problems, based on your description.

Aside from that, this forum isn't a support forum for computer problems, please keep that in mind in the future!
