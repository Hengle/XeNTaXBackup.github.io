- Post Title: Forspoken font files

Hello everyone,

I need help with figuring out the content of Forspoken fonts: [http://stare.lokalizacie.sk/files/apps/ ... nfonts.zip](http://stare.lokalizacie.sk/files/apps/forspokenfonts.zip)

The header is "SEDB", Square Enix DB, and the subtype is "uifn" which is a new format. I assume the fonts could be 3D based on the in-game effects. All files have the same structure, 0x10 is filesize and 0x30 is start of compressed data.

I ran comtype_scan on the chunks from 0x30 but haven't found anything.

Thanks for any hint!
