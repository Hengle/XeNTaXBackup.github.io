I tried using this script GIANTS Software GAR archives (script 0.3.2) [http://aluigi.altervista.org/papers/bms ... ftware.bms](http://aluigi.altervista.org/papers/bms/giants_software.bms) 
but after going back files (reimport) the entire game is screwing. Does anyone know another way to return the files back?
