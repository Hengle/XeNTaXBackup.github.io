Hi, I was wondering if I could get some help in extracting a file included with Hot Wheels: World Race for PC.
The file name is harchive.bad, and I could not find anything related to the .bad file format or the filename. I did open the file with hexedit, and the first letters to appear were CSH, which is a Photoshop Custom Shapes file, but I'm doubting that's the real file type, because opening the file in notepad++ has some code from the game too.
The main reason for extracting the files is because I want to edit the textures. All other files include with the game are unencrypted, such as .bik files for video and .ogg files for music. If you can't help in anyway, that's fine.

Here is the file so you can go from there:
[https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/926 ... rchive.bad](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/92643584/harchive.bad)

Please tell me if this is against the rules, as I don't want to be distributing the file if it is illegal to do so.
