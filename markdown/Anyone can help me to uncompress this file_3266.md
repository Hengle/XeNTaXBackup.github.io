Ah! This is the LZR used in Mana Khemia. I wish somebody would hack this compression. LZR seems to indicate a LZR compressed chunk (obviously, I know...) it should be fairly easy to crack... though everybody is so... not around much because they are busy with things elsewhere...

If it helps, I'll try to have a look at it. I'm not an expert though. It would help to have a decompressed version of the same file.
