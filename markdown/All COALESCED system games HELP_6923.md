- Post Title: All COALESCED system games *HELP*

Hi All,

I would like to ask for help to everyone who is interest about the Unreal Engine games. I need help to revers a new coalesced format please, as i have not enought knowledge to do it myself.  Please anyone help to do it as this is used on most games and it would be great if anyone can break it down. If you find the system in this bin files than i'm pretty sure do the all future games would be easy to do.  File examples also attached(files are split into directories with game name).

Download Examples :

oh, maybe it will be useful for somebody
i found how calculated as the length of the string in Shadows of the damned and asura's wrath in coalesced.bin (ps3)
(FF-XX)*2+2
example 
4 byte before the string FF FF FF DE 
(FF-DE)*2+2=44 byte string length

I changed the line in subtitles in Shadows of the damned and it work fine
