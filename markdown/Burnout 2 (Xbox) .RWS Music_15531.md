- Post Title: Burnout 2 (Xbox) .RWS Music

With GENH (in VGM Toolbox), I've been able to only semi-extract the stereo versions of each music track from the Xbox version of Burnout 2. It seems that when I do extract a track, it plays fine for about a second, then ear-rapes for another second, going back to normal again for another second and so on. And I've only ever gotten that close for most of the tracks, not all of them. I've tried all sorts of interleave values (I'm certain that an offset of 0x800 is correct), but I haven't been able to resolve the issue.

Here's one of the tracks:

I also included the Surround sound and Dolby Digital versions.

The one ending in st is stereo, dd is Dolby Digital and pl is Surround sound.

I'm sorry if I sound a bit lazy, but I actually have been at this for ages. Believe me! :S
Anyway, any help is greatly appreciated!
