Hi, friends...

 Has anyone heard of SuIt compression with sui as well as other extentions? The files are in the Masque slot games but I was thinking it was not a Masque exclusive format. 


 I can't view those wonderful graphics    not to mention I can't create my own.

The only thing I came up with was SUIT, something to do with Simple User Interface Tools, that also gives files with .sui extension.
