- Post Title: Call of duty 2 big red one 3d models

Hello, everyone I am trying to extract 3d models from the game call of duty 2 big red one using the hex2obj or model researcher, but yielding no results. I have tried to learn hex but it's just to difficult to understand and i was seeing if anybody created a script or knows how to convert .xboxmesh to obj.Luxox18 did the same thing with call of duty 3.
