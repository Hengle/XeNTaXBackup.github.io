We’ll let you in on a secret: Marketing aside, there is basically no difference between a kids’ skateboard and an adult skateboard. Most kids’ skateboards are about 6” wide but, truth be told, it’s going to be easier for kids to learn on a wider, standard 7.5” board. A wider board gives them greater stability and something to grow with. We spoke with Lamar Betts, of The Skateside skateboarding school in Los Angeles, California, and he says he always recommends a 7.5 for kids to start. They are easier to start with and they’ll last for much longer.

I'm not sure if it'll be of much help, but the same crew that made LP2 made Monster Hunter World, and there are a lot of tools and resources available for ripping from that game, so it may be usable for LP2 as well? Lemme know if you're able to get any progress with it ^^
