- Post Title: Demonicon .fuk and .l10nres files

I need help. I extracted the ".fuk" files with the Port Royale 3 Extractor, but within the texts are in a file "global.l10nres".
Would anyone know how to extract? [https://www.mediafire.com/?gi8q3o22d2gpoew](https://www.mediafire.com/?gi8q3o22d2gpoew)
