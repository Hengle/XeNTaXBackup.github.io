Hello!
I would like to translate this game, and i need some help, to decompile this language file. If you see it with a text editor, you'll see it's almost good. But i think if i edit it it will be corrupt. It contains all languages so i think it's an archive with seperate language files. If not then sorry.  Please help me to de\compile the file.
Thank you

I've programmed a tool for you. You can download it via my blog. If you find any bug, please let me know. As I don't have a iPhone or iPod Touch, i couldn't test it here.
