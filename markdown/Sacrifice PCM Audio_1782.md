Enough data for converison to any other format available.
at byte 32 and forward the data body is present.

Cheers!

Data is stored as PCM and bitdepth is regulated with the Bitdepth marker.

isn't 0000803F  1.0 float? i would think that would mean something rather than be an identifier.

Actually, i have no idea if they really meen something,
after analyzing 10 different audiofiles from the game and made a converter for the files to WAVE without no errors  (yet), then i have no
reason to belive they are something significant.

However, Ashur is testing the converter further now, so i have to stay tuned and see if he finds any errors with it. =o

I cannot open the files after extraction (even though MultiEx does extract them and with no error messages) of a Sacrifice archive (WAD file).  The thing is, they seem to be large enough to be sound files (they are short clips of unit speech), but after trying to open them with several different media players, I found that they would not play, or were unreadable.  Anyways, all I want to do is convert the sound files into a readable format.  The reason I downloaded the pirated game was so that I could rip the sound files, make them into a video, and post it on Youtube.  I've watched many good ones, but Sacrifice's unit sounds are so cool--and no one has done so yet--that I wanted to make a "video" (just sound) of them.
Edit: I was most certainly reaching!  A simple look with a hex editor showed me the error of my ways.    And furthermore, I found out that [Strobe added support for this format over 2 years ago.](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=9&t=897&st=0&sk=t&sd=a&start=15#p14190).
$%&@ing crazy.
Sorry Mr.Mouse and Strobe for wasting your time.

Because I have a related problem, instead of starting a new topic, I thought this the right place to post my problem.
Should I have started a new topic?
