- Post Title: Medieval Theme Adventure Game that can be extracted?

I'm looking for any PS2 or newer medieval themed adventure game that can be extracted, preferably more realism-oriented. I can do the extraction, just don't want to wad through lists of games to find ones that match my criteria. A lot of those game sites don't have good meta-data/tags.

Alternatively, a site that has extracted game assets for download is cool too.

Either way, thanks for your time.
