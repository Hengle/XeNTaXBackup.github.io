- Post Title: Star Conflict TFH/TFD texture

Hey guys, I was wondering if somebody has some good idea on these texture files, seemingly TFH stands for presumably header information while TFD is the main data chunk without header I believe.

I would guess this is some typical DDS data with obscure/custom header case but I lack any good tools to try put DDS headers etc on it to try.

Sadly given filesize limit, I can't provide very large files now but feel free PM for larger ones.

You might try TextureFinder to get bmps from the files.
