Same request, I just installed the game the other day.  I notice NOLF1 is supported, but that extractor would work with 2.

The only way to find out it to test it yourself on the game. If it does work, let us know. Otherwise, if you attach a small archive to the forums here, we may be able to work out the format for you.
