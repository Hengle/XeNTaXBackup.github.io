- Post Title: Is It Possible To Rip From PS3 Games

Hi everyone, I'm not sure if this is in the right place or not but I'm hoping you guys can help. Is it possible to rip from PS3 games primarily Killzone 2 and 3 is what I'm looking to pull the models from, and I really don't need the textures as I''m not wanting the models for game modding or anything like that. 
I do papercraft modelling, known as pepakura where I take a 3D model, break it up into sections and turn that 3D model into a printable 2D puzzle that once you construct it you recreate the 3D model out of paper. 
Thing is I'm kinda new to game ripping except for when it comes to the 3D Ripper DX program, so I'm hoping someone here can be of help.

Jail Breaking your ps3 will give you the possibility to rip the files but you'll have to work on those files in order to get geometry.

So I can't just take the disk, make a ISO and then access the files in the ISO in some way to get the models?

you take the disc put it in a jailbroken ps3 use multiman to dump the disc then use the ftp program on the ps3 to transfer it to your pc.
