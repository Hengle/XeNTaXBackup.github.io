- Post Title: [Help] Final Fantasy X HD .bin text files.

Hey all. I've been trying to assemble a bilingual script of Final Fantasy X using the source game files.
I was able to dump my .vbf files, and was even able to use [RK's FFXHD Translation Tools](https://www.moddb.com/games/final-fantasy-x/downloads/final-fantasy-x-hd-translation-tools) to dump all the English text, but no success into getting it to convert the Japanese text. 
Are there any other known tools for converting the .bin files in this game?
