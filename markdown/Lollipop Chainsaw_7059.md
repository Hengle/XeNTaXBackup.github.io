I suppose we shouldn't expect any less from the country that brought us [High School of the Dead](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_School_of_the_Dead)... Oh, Japan, you and your crazy crazy...

Please do indeed keep up the healthy crazyness.  Just stop making another Zelda game, ok?  Oh and get these robots to become even more human!
