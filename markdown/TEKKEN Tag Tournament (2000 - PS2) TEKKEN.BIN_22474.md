Hey guys, I've been trying to see the contents of the TEKKEN.BIN file, which contains all the game data. I can't figure out which file format it has, so I can't just unpack it. So I was wondering if any of you had an idea of what I can do in order to unpack or at least see the contents of that file.

I don't know how to extract everyting, but I was able 
to get some resources like text strings or sounds using PSound and Hex Workshop
