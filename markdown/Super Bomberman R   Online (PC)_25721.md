- Post Title: Super Bomberman R  / Online (PC)

The game runs Unity, however it appears they compressed/encrypted the assetbundles in StreamingAssets/InAppAssets.

Store Page: [https://store.steampowered.com/app/1308 ... _R_Online/](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1308380/Super_Bomberman_R_Online/) It's a pretty small download.
