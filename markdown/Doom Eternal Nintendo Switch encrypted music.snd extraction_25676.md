- Post Title: Doom Eternal Nintendo Switch encrypted music.snd extraction?

Was wondering if anybody here knows how to extract the music.snd file from the Doom Eternal Nintendo Switch version.

It appears to be encrypted. No usual extractor had any luck with the file and the ogg vorbis stream extractor that works with the PC version has no effect on this file, probably not ogg since the Switch uses a own, often higher quality, codec.

Here are my raw Switch rom extacts:

I already asked this on hcs64 some months ago but sadly so far nobody could figure anything out.
