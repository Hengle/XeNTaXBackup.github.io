- Post Title: Twisted Metal: Black Main Menu music|Extracting .BNK files with VGMToolbox guide.

I've extracted the SND folder containing the .BNK files of Twisted Metal: Black for PS2. My only concern now is how to extract, or maybe open, or convert, those .BNK files with certain methods.

I already have VGMToolbox, and had tried so many presets to convert/open/extract those .BNK files, but to no success, just no output of the files anywhere, no conversion, nothing. Could any of you respected people on this forum give me some help, please?

I'll provide you with a shareable link for the SND folder containing the .BNK files I'm talking about, hopefully that can give you a better understanding of my issue:

[https://drive.google.com/open?id=183ate ... 8rqJKD8LUk](https://drive.google.com/open?id=183ates55doEiEsft52Nowf8rqJKD8LUk) (Going to have to copy and paste this link in the Google search tab)

(I'm mostly interested in the file(s) named SHELLMUS.BNK, SHELLCAR.BNK, and SHELLSFX.BNK., for I believe one of those files to contain the music track used for the games main menu screen)

PSound can get you the audio from those BNK archives.  However, if you want the music, that is stored in the SHELLMUS.BNK file, but not as an audio file.  All of the instruments are stored separately, and there is a MIDI-like table to put it all together.  So it would need someone to decipher this table to discover how the instruments are played.

Thanks for your help, PSound worked out perfectly, extracting those .BNK files, I appreciate your assistance. Now, where can I find this MIDI-like table/create such thing, and how exactly do I decipher how the instruments are played exactly?

Sorry for such a late reply by the way, didn't know how to respond back exactly.
