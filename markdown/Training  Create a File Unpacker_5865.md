you can build file unpackers with any language, so long as it supports reading/writing files

delphi has the tstream class (tfilestream, tmemorystream) which i've used to create unpackers.
heres a more complicated example (rebuilding an xml format (warning: recursion!)) - [download/file.php?id=3662](http://forum.xentax.com/download/file.php?id=3662)
