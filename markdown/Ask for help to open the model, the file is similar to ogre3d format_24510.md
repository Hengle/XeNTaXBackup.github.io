Thanks shakotay2     
But the UV of the mesh does not seem to be correct.
There are many files in this file. If there is an export plug-in, or can I open the script directly?

hi,Karpati
The game from China, This game expired a long time ago and the website has been lost
The translation should be called HeroBiography. Sorry for my bad English.
If necessary, I can organize more sample files. Is there a way to open the model with a similar plug-in or script and convert it to other commonly used formats?

The installed game are in the SheDiaoOL folder.
I googled for the 'SheDiaoOL' and I did find some interesting thing like this.

Is it possible that the name of the game is Legend of the Condor Heroes?

Thank you very much, can you open the mesh model directly?      
Where can I download this 3D Object Converter?
Yes, this translation is not very accurate, but it can be said to be rough.

I can open the .mesh and the .col files directly.

I did not release this version yet, because I am working on the automatic material assignments.

I see, very outstanding 3D format conversion software
Thank you Karpati for your work    
After you release this new version, can I download it directly from this website and purchase a lifetime license?

This is my friend, he took out the similar environment file part from the source file.
However, many files cannot be opened correctly.

nice   
The previously problematic mesh seems to be able to be opened
No problem, I try to test the elements of the scene.
Then enter the official version of the software
