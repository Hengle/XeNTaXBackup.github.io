Im trying to extract some models from dragon age 2, but the textures aren't named so i can't texture the model ive extracted
im looking for the warrior/rogue/mage champion's outfit(doesnt matter which one, the one you know will be just fine) i have 19000 textures in that folder, and im not getting anywhere near finding the correct one, any help?
