Nice,i hope it's possible to get characters models too,with rigging or without it.
P.S i think char models are in file called global.dsb 
Edit: Looks like char models are isn't stored in apk,because i can't find any files in my SdCard folder + game are over 120mb after installation,so i think i should have root to access game's files which i can't get currently,because i don't have access to my laptop.
But thanks anyway.

ah okay. I found a plugin though rather specific and I don't think matches my version. Also reading that this is a format supported by Daz?
Anyways great to see this progressing. For anyone that doesn't know there's a slew of new characters coming in the next big update, however, Ludia already put the actual model files in the game directory (Shinigami, Classic Shredder, Space Turtles, Alopex, Kunoichi April so on). I extract most active game files about every month or so to keep my work files up to date and found them in there today.

I'll make another note here as I see question about retaining animation around the web. While their are some animations like the idle, basic attacks and victory poses most of the attacks are actually cut screen movies most likely in SWF form so there are no animations to snatch from them.
