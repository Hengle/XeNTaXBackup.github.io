- Post Title: Medal of Honor Vanguard Wii viv files

Does anyone know how to unpack the viv files from Medal of Honor Vanguard on the Wii?
I tried all the tools I have that can read big/viv files with no luck.

Samples here

The attached script will extract that sample VIV file.  The files extracted all seem to the other type of VIV file, with the "BIGF" header, which other scripts should be able to read.
