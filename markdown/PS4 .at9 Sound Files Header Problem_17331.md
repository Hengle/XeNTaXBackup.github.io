- Post Title: PS4 .at9 Sound Files Header Problem

So I have been working with the .at9 files of PS4 and the problem I am facing is that the .at9 files are inside FSB5 files, and the FSB Extractors don't have the proper header data for ATRAC9 files.
I have put links for one of the extracted .at9 files (The header is placed by the FSB Extractor and is just a normal WAV header, not ATRAC9 header) and the original FSB file as the FSB Extractor does show information about the files.

Extracted .at9 file:
