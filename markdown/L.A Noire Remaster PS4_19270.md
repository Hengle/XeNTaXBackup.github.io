you can export text root.atb.ps4 via cases-atb-unpakovac.1sc, but I do not know how to import :/ some ideas?

edit: unpack root.atb.ps4 via cases-atb-unpakovac.1sc, it will do the root.a.txt file .... rename it to cases0.txt and root.atb.ps4 rename to cases0_0_dat...execute script cases-atb-importer (1).1sc and open cases0_0_dat and cases0.txt for import text....then rename cases0_0_dat on root.atb.ps4 and finish ....I'll try this it tomorrow

Does anyone know whether PS3/X360 have better music quality (~80kbps mp3) than PC version?

Does the music game archive file was noticeably bigger than in PC version?

Maybe someone already ripped VR version, or PS4/X1, or maybe know whether music is in better quality in these versions?
