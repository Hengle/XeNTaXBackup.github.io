- Post Title: Devilian - client files

Good morning, dear forum friends.
I am looking for a Korean computer game, and almost all links on the Internet are missing or no longer functioning.
The name of the game is Devilian
If someone has a miracle created and shares a computer client,I am even ready to pay the amount for this.
Thanks in advance, sorry for my poor English.

This is the official website of the game, it has been lost

Thank you very much, brother. It seems to be invalid. Do you have a client that can upload a cloud server?

If there is the latest version, it is great        
I think as long as there is a complete client, please trouble Allanoon to transfer a cloud service for me.
Thank you

HI~Allanoon , I want to ask a question about importing nif from Devilian
I installed Blender 249 and Python 26.
Starting the blender and using the script to open the nif is invalid, do you have a way?
This is the sample file I provided, thank you

I read the instructions and it seems that the new version modifies the nif format
I want to know if Devilian needs an older version?
For example in 2014

It's working for me~
Be sure to have blender 2.49b and python 2.6 installed properly.
Then open Blender249.blend, left click on the left window where's the script is and press Alt+P (sometimes it'll type a "p" instead, delete the "p" and retry) you should now be able to select the .nif file and it should import properly.
