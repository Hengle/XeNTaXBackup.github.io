I've tried fsbext, and it didn't work. How would I convert the [fsb](http://www.mediafire.com/?rynuxpn1eppu32u) to little endian?

Do you have the latest version of [FSBExt](http://aluigi.altervista.org/papers/fsbext.zip) from Aluigi?

I just ran the file through FSBExt just then and it gave me 2,462 files with the GENH extension.

These can be played with a Winamp plugin known as VGMStream.
