South Park Rally Toolkit, v1.6:
[http://www.mediafire.com/file/a025ma1k8 ... it_1.6.zip](http://www.mediafire.com/file/a025ma1k819i71v/South_Park_Rally_Toolkit_1.6.zip)

Extracts and repacks:
*.VRAM files (from folder "art")
*.RBH files (from folder "sound") 

[http://www.mediafire.com/download/4xd56 ... it_src.zip](http://www.mediafire.com/download/4xd56puxhjcht04/South_Park_Rally_Toolkit_src.zip)
The source files contain an unfinished rbh model extractor, so far only the big rbh files of the race tracks can be extracted as obj files - but only without textures.

Thanks for all your help, I really appreciate all you've done!

 Hope someone goes further on this "study".


Thanks, Herbert!

Probably bit too late, but can you add support for Manx TT Superbike's RBH files?

If needed I can provide a sample
