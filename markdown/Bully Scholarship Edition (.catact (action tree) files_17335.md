- Post Title: Bully: Scholarship Edition (.cat/act (action tree) files

Hey long time modder for Bully Scholarship Edition I've been wondering if anyone here can help me out with decompiling/extracting folders from these .cat files been having real trouble since there isn't a tool out there I found that can do so can anyone take the time out of the day to take a look at the file and see what's up with it?
