- Post Title: Problems extracting models from FF13 (PS3/XBOX 360)

Hello.
I'm trying to extract Lightning's 3D model from this game but I can't find her in any .TRB file I extract from some .BIN files. There are still some .BIN files that QuickBMS couldn't open.
I tried to extract her model from both PS3 and XBOX 360 versions.
These are the files where I couldn't extract from:

XBOX 360:
white_z0220u_img.x360.bin
white_z0230u_img.x360.bin
white_z0240u_img.x360.bin

PS3:
white_z0160e_img.ps3.bin
white_z0220e_img.ps3.bin
white_z0230e_img.ps3.bin
white_z0240e_img.ps3.bin

Can anyone help me?
Thanks.
