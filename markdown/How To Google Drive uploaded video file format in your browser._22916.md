- Post Title: How To Google Drive uploaded video file format in your browser.?

Every time when trying to upload video file of any size (there is plenty of free space on my Google Drive) it fails with "File unreadable" error.
I was able to upload successfully many times in the past. It's just started happening recently.

I tried different Windows computers, different methods drag & drop or clicking "+" and "File Upload" buttons but always the same results - "File unreadable". 
Doesn't matter what video format (avi, mp4, mpg) or size.
I cleared Browsing Data in Chrome but no luck.
Any idea what could be causing it and how to fix it ?
