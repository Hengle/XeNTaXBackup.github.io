- Post Title: Need somebody to extract the files from my archive file

Hey, I am doing a project and I need someone to extract all the data from my archive from the link I provided
Make sure tho that the files are an original file format, not filenames like for example "if there is an image file in there I want it to show .png instead of.file if its a png file"
I did take some time to look into the archive file it has a signature of bugr which upon doing some research it uses the burger-Lib SDK or library.
But my coding skills are somewhat not so good so that's why I am asking someone to extract all the files from the archive I posted here and then send me a 
link pertaining the files.
The file is from the killing time pc fps shooter game. 

Here is the archive file link to download: [https://www.mediafire.com/file/2vcgkur2 ... E.zip/file](https://www.mediafire.com/file/2vcgkur2h0vrklu/KILLTIME.zip/file)
I appreciate any help I get from you all I really do

Then probably you need an asset convertor instead of an extractor. Anyway here's a BMS script for data extraction.

No pngs will be shown though.
