Does anyone know what compression are these? Maybe the pc is LZO, and the x360 is LZX, but I'm not sure.
I cutted the unpacked PC file from the memory!

Thanks

I know some people which are making translation of this game to my language, if you wish I'll give their e-mails and you can contact with them.

You're very kind, but in meantime I solved everything. And I'm done with my translation too.

You can even share this tool I got the files from the PS3 I wanted to do tests to check the possibility of working with them for a translation for PS3.

Hug.

No, dead end. The ps3 and the pc files are use the same compression, but the ps3 always crash with the ps3 compatible repacked str file. We'll try out the uncompressed version, maybe the game can use that. But just after Easter. And I don't have tool for the str files, especial not for the console version. I made the test str files with hand -> with hex editor.

I'll say, if this works.

Okay, here is poised to download too.

is better to use scripts BMS or Gibbed.Visceral, to extract the. viv PS3? Repak's for them?

the files you are working are the LH2?

Dante's hell no files are similar, can we test too?

A good Easter for you and your family.

Gibbed. Extract and repack.

Yes, english .lh2.

Dante's Inferno use the same (just older) engine, but the texts are not inside 1 file. I want to translate too, but I don't know how.
