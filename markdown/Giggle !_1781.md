i have more requests for the "any feature" feature. how about a
"Unpack" button. and it will automatically unpack everything?
(including decrypting everything)

and im still waiting for the "Create Game" button. 
also a "Hack net" button so i can still access the internet without having
an network card installed.

stop being lazy, i demand those! k k ?!
