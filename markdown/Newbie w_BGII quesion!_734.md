Hi, I just downloaded the MultiEx commander and tried to 'rip' some graphics out of Baldur's Gate II.  It reads from the .BIF files and loads their contents into the screen listing but what do I next.  I try to extract a file but I get a NoName000x file.  Any guidance would be greatly appreciated.  Also, is there a FAQ\Help file for MultiEx?

You get the noname00x, because the files don't have names in the archives. It's up to you to find out what these files are, try to open them in a hexeditor to find out. Get Hex Workshop for instance, from Breakpoint Software. 

You could also port one here, perhaps somebody here can identify it.

Thanks, Mr. Mouse.  That seems like a pretty large hoop to jump through.  What exactly am I seeing when I load the .BIF file then? I have tried to rename one that I extracted to every possible image format but to no avail.  I guess it is possible that the files are raw image files without the format header information.  (ie. bmp, gif, etc).  AFWIW it could be anything, a script or some other binary information.  Will looking at it in Hex Workshop really reveal its contents?  I am not a hacker by any stretch so sorry for the 'dumb' questions.
