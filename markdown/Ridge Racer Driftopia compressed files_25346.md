- Post Title: Ridge Racer Driftopia compressed files

Hello! Help unpack the game archives from this game. We are creating a global mod for Ridge Racer Unbouded and would like to transfer the tracks and cars from the online version of the game.
Link game - [https://www.moddb.com/games/ridge-racer ... game-files](https://www.moddb.com/games/ridge-racer-driftopia/downloads/complete-game-files)
The game is free and closed a long time ago.
There is an unpacker for the single player version of the game, but it does not work with this game
