- Post Title: Updated Dead Space Assets Thread (2020-...)

I wanted to make an updated thread for matters on the Dead Space franchise, ranging from the three main games to the mobile game and Extraction or whatever.

Here's the first thread:

viewtopic.php?t=14622

Here's also my tutorial for extracting models out of the game with tools currently available:

viewtopic.php?f=16&t=21530

Contains I'm pretty sure every single most up to date scripts for textures, audio and models for all three main games. I've obtained them either from this website or Zenhax over the years, so credits to everyone who have done them, I take credit for only compiling them to one single download page.

Here's a Blender script for Dead Space 1 models:

[https://zenhax.com/viewtopic.php?f=5&t=4398](https://zenhax.com/viewtopic.php?f=5&t=4398)

But from the look of it, it's for a pretty old version of the software.

Currently, what are extractable are models from Dead Space 1, 2 and 3 that are strictly anything but level related.

Scripts for Dead Space 2 and 3 that are available for 3D Max only can open level related models but their UVs are broken. There may be some models that do not even extract. Also, batch extraction is not available for low LOD models, such as ammunition or health packs.

Extraction for Dead Space 1 is available via Noesis and also only for anything but level related models. However, Noesis completely breaks the meshes of these models.

Most of the textures are fully extractable, they may be some certains textures that do not open but I honestly don't remember anymore.

I'm fairly certain extraction for PS3 Dead Space 1 models and textures is available, but that's only good for getting the console exclusive DLC suits. Everything else is in the PC version.

.RCB skeletons are individually extractable and with another script, one can extract the weights of individual model parts along with the skeleton and the mesh. However, a lot of models come with broken UVs with that script and there's no batch compatiblity so good luck importing 100 individual pieces one at a time. Also, the bones come up with random numbers as their names.

Edit: For models that come with weights:

Sounds, as far as I'm aware of, are fully extractable from all three main games.

I don't know if any significant research has been done on Dead Space: Extraction and Dead Space: Mobile.

What still needs to be done is batch or individual export for models with weights for all three main games with just one single script that is also able to import animations from all three main games and should be able to import intact level models also from the three games with fixed UVs.

If also possible, automatic material and texture import would be neat as well extractable, although this is definetly not possible unless someone creates a seperate tool for extracting things out of the games.
