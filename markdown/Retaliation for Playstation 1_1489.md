Hi Mr Mouse!!

I have a problem. I have found a program that can extract streaming data from the above CD, but there is a MIX file on the disc also that seems to have data in it - INI files, BIN files etc... 

I know you don't support the normal CnC games becasue of the other programs out there, unfortunately CCMixer or RAMixer cannot read it. Is it possible that you could try to find the key to extracting these files? It's not so important to have full names as there is a FAT file on the disc with those listed, but file types would help, or at least file numbers (i.e. FILE001, FILE002 etc...)

Attached part of the file here...

Cheers for now

If this might help. I will attach the FAT fle from the same disc which details the contents of the data.mix file and the data.xa streaming content.

I hope someone can maybe produce a file to get into this. It would make my life complete (for now!)

Cheers for now

It does indeed list the contents of the other two files.

Even if it means having the files un-named I would be happy as I have all the information I need in the FAT file to rename them by hand.

Cheers for now

Hey guys.. Cancel my request.

I managed to find an extractor on a Russian Extractor site (plus there are many more listed... especially MultiEx!!!

It's a bit basic, but it does the job if you are prepared to put in the leg work and rename stuff! 

Look here for a full list of downloads....
