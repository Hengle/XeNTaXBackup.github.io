There's only 1 real "ktx" file in the folder "ktx can't open", which is 000000a2.dat.
The rest dat files from both folders are mesh files which can be converted perfectly by CyberConv.

Do you have any link of that tool?
I've already seen that ktx header at first place
And also convert using Acewell script to convert into ktx files 
But it seems i can't open it somehow with mali compression tool
Is it realy ktx files?
Or there some kind other way to convert to ktx files?
