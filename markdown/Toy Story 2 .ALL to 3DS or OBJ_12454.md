- Post Title: Toy Story 2 .ALL to 3DS or OBJ?

I wonder if anybody can look at these .ALL files and make a QuickBMS script or something that can convert .ALL files into an .OBJ or .3DS file? I will attach a .7z archive with 7 different .ALL files to look at. It is 63.1 KB decompressed and 21.3 KB compressed.
