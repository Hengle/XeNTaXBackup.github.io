- Post Title: Ninja Ripper T-Man issues

Hi all,
       New to the board but I've been reading for a while. Finally encountered an issue so decided to register and take advantage of the wealth of knowledge from all of you.

Ive been using Ninja Ripper to pull some game files. Specifically the wire frames for pepping. However when using ninja ripper my toon is put into the T-man position but the armour that I want has shoulder pads. In the T-man position the shoulder pads get squished for want of a better word and im wondering if there is a way to use ninja to get a rip without the T-man position.

On an old XP machine I was able to use 3D Ripper DX but now on win 7 (64bit) i cant use it as the game I want uses a launcher and trying to go direct to the game exe doesnt work as cant  connect to the account server when the game loads. Ive tried putting all the main game files into the same folder as the launcher and then using the direct exe game launch but that didnt work either.

Any help greatly appreciated

Many Thanks
