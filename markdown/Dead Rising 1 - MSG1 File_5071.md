- Post Title: Dead Rising 1 - MSG1 File

Well, im working on this kind of file for a while now, but with no sucess.

They look like the ones in resident evil 5, i've created a tool to edit the re5 texts so i know a litle bit of this kind of file, but these from dead rising 1 from xbox 360 are different.

Can anyone help me out?

Thakns.

- Post Title: Dead Rising 1 - MSG1 File

I'm bumping up this old topic, as I'd also like to translate this game into my language.

The file is an rMessage file (like itemname_u16_usa.rMessage), and if I open it in a HEX Editor, then it has an MSG1 written there immediately. I can't seem to find any text in it, as it might be encrypted. I'm certain this is the file that contains the game's text, but I need help decrypting/exporting it (and the re-import it back to the game).
