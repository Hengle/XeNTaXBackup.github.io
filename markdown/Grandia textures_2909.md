Hi there, I've been trying to find for some textures in the Grandia I game for the PlayStation and I can't seem to find certain graphics. I think the ones I'm after have 8-bit palettes, though everything is a mess.

In this Game there is a lot of TIM and raw tim picture...

Remember that this game is a conversion from a saturn game...

The background of battles are in tim format inside each file in the BATTLE folder.

The faces of characters are in MDP files, but in an unknow format...
(maybe saturn graphic format)

(thanks to Mentz - the italian grandia translator - for this info)

Actually, I wanted to translate the game to Spanish, and I'm after the "Press Start Button" and "New Game/Load Game/Options" data. Also the logos as well (I found them, but I didn't knew how edit them, those are another story).

Thanks for the info, though.

Where did you find them?   
And why you don't know how to edit them ?

If you need help for repoint the texts in the game....   
I can give you some hint... An app exist but is for private use...

BIN\LOGO.dat or something. With TimViewer I can see the GameArts logo, and hexediting it I managed to change the UbiSoft logo. Though, neither I can't see something clear in Tile Molester nor any RAW utils I know do something as well.

About pointers, please PM me.
