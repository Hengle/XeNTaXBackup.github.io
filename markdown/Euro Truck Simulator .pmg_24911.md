Im aware there are SCS tools for blender. But sadly you can only do them 1 by 1.    After looking at some of the data I found a few things.

I would like to batch these all with Noesis if possible. Any help?

DK Dave wrote an importer I hope he dont mind me sharing it. Thanks for taking the time to write one seems both of you finished it at the same time. I will look at other Simulator titles to see if data is the same.

I have finished my Prism3D Engine 	(American Truck Simulator: Wyoming, Euro Truck Simulator) *.PMG/PMD/MAT/TOBJ load module.

It supports the 0x11, 0x13, 0x15 .pmg file versions.
It uses the .pmd, .mat, .tobj files to get the texture filenames.


I have released the following program:
- 3D Object Converter v10.001 (Windows)

How to get the 3D Object Converter v10.001:
Download the 3D Object Converter from [ http://3doc.i3dconverter.com](http://3doc.i3dconverter.com) and install it or download and use the portable version (if you don’t have it yet).
(Or just use the Help/Check for updates... function to get the v10.001.)
