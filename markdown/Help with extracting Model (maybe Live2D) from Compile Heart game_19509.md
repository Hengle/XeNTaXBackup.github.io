I got a MP010101.pck file from Date A Live game by Compile Heart. Since most other files in the game files are BGs, CGs, and UIs, I guess these .pck contains Character Model for the Visual Novel, maybe made with Live2D?
After extracting .pck file I get these files:
001.amb | config.txt | exprLoop.exl | face.bin | face.lz7 | face.uca.bin | layername.bin | screen.txt | tex_all_s.bin | tex_all_s.tex
Layername.bin seems to hold the files' names of the model (like hair or arm)
Extracting tex_all_s.tex resulting an image file which look like a pallete or something.
Can someone help me extracting these models?
