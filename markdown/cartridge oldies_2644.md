- Post Title: cartridge oldies?

I have a Genesis, and I was wondering, is there anyone here who is experienced in programming, ripping, modding, or otherwise tearing up this system, or it's cartridges? Though I realize it is nigh impossible to do anything significant with it, I do hope to do some twiddling around with it, and the more I learn about how to do that, the more I can learn how it works.  I have oodles of carts that you can't pay people to take from you (AKA sports games) to twiddle around with, and lots of spare time. 



P.S. I know that there are websites out there with a few things here or there (and I don't mind links) but it is always better to hear it from a person. That way, it can be laid out in layman's terms, and they don't (necessarily) tell you to "piss off because I get way too many emails of stuff I already explained"
