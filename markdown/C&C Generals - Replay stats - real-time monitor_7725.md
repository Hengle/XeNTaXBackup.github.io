- Post Title: C&C Generals - Replay stats - real-time monitor

I've created my own tool to monitor stats real-time during a replay of a Generals match. 
This shows more of the dynamics of the match, than the boring final screen at the end of a match. 

Here's an example from the NWP2011 we held at the beginning of this month.

The Age wins the battle for resources, Can_o_whoop and Guapoman are like brothers. Oh wait. They are. 
The Gee can't keep up.

Cashflow during the game. The Age takes the lead, Guapoman and Can_o_whoop take turns



game2buildingsconst1.png (25.75 KiB) Viewed 111 times


Buildings constructed during the game (cumulative). The Age takes the lead.



game2buildingslost1.png (23.08 KiB) Viewed 111 times


Buildings lost by player. Guapoman just kept on losing buildings until he convinced his baby brother to help him against The Age. Together they caused a lot of mayhem against The Age (time 0:53-1:109).

Indeed. Number or buildings destroyed by player. Clearly visible is the campaign of The Age against Guapomon, a curve that resembles a lot the Lost Buildings line of Guapoman in the previous chart. Also visible is the effect of the alliance against The Age, who never lost a building until the joined attack.

However, looking at the active buildings curve, The Age has survived the onslaught neatly, and was on the return with a lot of active buildings in the end-phase of the match.The uprise of Can_o_whoop was stopped short in the end.



cumulativebasevalue1.png (24.44 KiB) Viewed 111 times


The cumulative base value in resources is shown. The Age spent the most on the buildings in terms of value. Can_o_whoop comes in second.



game2unitsconstructed1.png (25.56 KiB) Viewed 111 times


The total cumulative number of units constructed. Guapoman takes the lead, as at the time of the attack of the illegal alliance against The Age, he was severly weakened by the latter, and focussed on just churning out infantry from then on, hence the dramatic rise in cheap units. His brother Can_o_whoop build less units, but basically just big tanks. 
The Gee has no role of significance. 



game2unitsdestroyed1.png (26.5 KiB) Viewed 111 times


The Age has to allow Can_o_whoop a minor victory in terms of total number of units destroyed, while Guapoman takes a close third place. The Gee fell behind in this game.



game2unitslost1.png (22.65 KiB) Viewed 111 times


Guapoman has a steep linear line to "victory" and lost the most units by far. Of course, taking into account he focus on infantry, that will be no surprise. The Age suffered from the Alliance but managed to stall the losses for a while. 
The Gee and Can_o_whoop lost never much, but granted, both played China and built only tanks.



table_buildingsdestroyedbyplayervsplayer.png (12.33 KiB) Viewed 111 times


In terms of buildings destroyed, Can_o_whoop wins, with The Age a close second. You can see who attacked who from this table.



table_unitsdestroyedbyplayervsplayer.png (12.95 KiB) Viewed 111 times


2187 units died during this match. You can see Guapoman and The Age didn't like eachother (both had quite some distance between them). While Can_o_whoop destroyed his brother's Guapoman units mostly until after the attack of the illegal alliance against The Age. The Gee had his base next to Guapoman, and it shows in his focus.



illegalallianceagainsttheage.png (9.96 KiB) Viewed 111 times


Though the rules agreed upon stated "no alliances", this table shows that Guapoman and Can_o_whoop attacked The Age at the same time, while not attacking eachother, apart from some collateral damage.

[EDIT] 
Here's the final score in-game:

Game 3. NWP2011



game3resgath1.png (33.68 KiB) Viewed 92 times


Guapoman wins the race for resources, followed by the_gee. The Age could not keep up in the game, and was attacked by both of them one hour into the game with all they got, and destroyed (his last words were: "What the...? You so scared you need to attack me together?! Fuck that!"). the_gee joined Guapoman's attack on The Age (who was succesfully campaigning against Guapoman, having already destroyed his main base) thinking he was destroying the strongest player at that time. In terms of resources, the_gee would have done better to attack Guapoman. Also, alliances were not allowed.



game3cashflow1.png (35.05 KiB) Viewed 92 times


This also shows from the flow of resources to build units. Guapoman focussed on getting out as much infantry out, creating a rock steady continues cashflow. Around the half-hour mark, all were equal, when Guapoman set up new shops where Paus left his base (both Paus and Herr Anton had to leave the game early after 10 minutes, practically handing over their resources to the_gee and Guapoman). The Age was stuck in a corner and was clearly not going to win the resources battle.



game3maxbasevalue1.png (20.26 KiB) Viewed 92 times


That The Age was stuck in the corner also shows from the max base value score. Already at the 30 minute mark, expansion was not really possible. Plenty of room for both Guapoman and The Gee though (the last wins in terms of base value cumulative). Still, when The Age hit a wall, he decided to remove the expansion barrier called Guapoman and during 20 minutes put a stop to Guapoman's expansion.



game3bldconst1.png (20.75 KiB) Viewed 92 times


Indeed, the 20 minute campaign of The Age against Guapoman did work and levelled his upwards curve in terms of buildings constructed. This ended when The Gee joined Guapoman in nuking, bombing and shelling the shit out of The Age. The Gee, who never build as much buildings as the cornered The Age, even though the_gee had a little less than an hour extra play time after The Age's defeat. Guapoman built on happily and takes the win.



game3bldestr1.png (20.5 KiB) Viewed 85 times


The Age and The Gee destroyed the most buildings, with The Gee destroying most of all. When Guapoman and The Gee started their combined assault on The Age at 1:00, The Age had already destroyed 40 buildings (most of Guapoman), The Gee 28 buildings, and Guapoman only 19. The Age managed 5 more in the attack he suffered to 45, while The Gee climbed to 41 (destroying 13 of The Age's buildings) during the attack, and Guapoman to 21. In the hour that followed, Guapoman destroyed 17 more (to 38), and The Gee also 17 more (to 58). 



game3bldlost1.png (17.07 KiB) Viewed 92 times


The above chart of Buildings Lost underlines both the successful campaign of The Age against Guapoman, who destroyed his main base and more from 0:45. On the hour mark, The Age was attacked by the_gee and Guapoman together. In that 5 minute period, The Age was annihilated. They then took another 5 minutes of rest after which skirmishes between them started.



game3basesize1.png (27.07 KiB) Viewed 92 times


Looking at the base size (buildings) at any time, the lebensraum Guapoman had is clear and he has certainly taken the lead there. The Age attacking him did cost him dearly though, until the_gee joined his counterattacks on The Age. Interestingly, the_gee never really had a base much larger than Paus who had left the game after 10 minutes, let alone the size of cornered The Age's base. At the 1:00 time point, The Age's base size was 37, The Gee 28 and Guapoman 44. In the aftermath of the assault on The Age, The Age quit the game with 22 buildings left, Guapoman had a base size of 52 (adding 8 more buildings), and The Gee had 29 (adding 1). Clearly, Guapoman took that opportunity to regrow his base now that The Age's pressure on him was gone and The Gee helped him out. Of note, when The Age put the pressure on Guapoman around 0:45, Guapoman had a base size of 62, The Age 46 and The Gee 26. When The Age was forced to stop his movement against Guapoman, Guapoman had 37 left (lost 25), The Age 37 (lost 9) and The Gee 28 (gained 2). 



game3unitsbuild1.png (20.73 KiB) Viewed 92 times


Guapoman and his infantry fetish has put him way up there with the total number of units built. The Age stepped up his unit creation during his campaign against Guapoman from 0:45 and even dramatically so when he was attacked by the alliance of the_gee and Guapoman. Still, there's only so much nukes one can handle and he was destroyed. the_gee, just building tanks mostly, lags behind because of that.



game3unitsdestroyed1.png (17.94 KiB) Viewed 92 times


The Age has campaigned twice, as can be seen from this chart. the_gee has a steady, but much slower attack pattern until he nukes/attacks The Age, and Guapoman has a slow pattern, until The Age starts to attack him and he has to defend. Guapoman becomes third in this race.



game3unitslost1.png (19.61 KiB) Viewed 92 times


Both Guapoman and The Age battled it out and lost the most units. After The Age's defeat, Guapoman just kept on losing his infantry, while the_gee built some more tanks, but never really attacked anything (just using his Lotus to attack....).



game3kdratio1.png (19.7 KiB) Viewed 92 times


Guapoman has the worst Destroyed/Lost ratio (Kill/Death), always losing much more units than taking (below 1!). The Age was good during his campaigns in maintaining a positive KD ratio. the_gee put his tanks to good use against Guapoman's infantry after The Age was defeated and upped his KD ratio to around 3.



game3bdratio1.png (22.73 KiB) Viewed 92 times


The created/lost units ratio. It shows more or less the time period per player of building bases and units, without attacking much. the_gee takes the price for the highest ever, of having 59 units, and 1 lost. The Age builds up twice, attacking and rebuilding. 20 minutes into the game, with Guapoman joining the assault/defend fun and the unit build-up is over. 

Then follow three curves of who destroyed who's units.

You can see when the_gee and Guapoman both attacked The Age around 1:00. No attacks on eachother. In fact, Guapoman never attacked the_gee during The Age's campaign against him from 0:45. 

All in all, the game lasted two hours. with Guapoman the victor.

I have to say... While the other players had better stats, Craptain was in the far lead in terms of consistency.

Cool toy btw.

All of the graphs in the first game, he cuts off very early on, presumably due to having been slaughtered mercilessly....

But at least that leaves his scores a nice consistent straight line, never gaining nor losing anything.

Yes, but the real question is, does Craptain see it that way?
