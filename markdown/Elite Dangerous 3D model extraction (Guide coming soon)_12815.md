I've figured it out finally. (This is using a ripper method)

This method uses ninjaripper. I've found out how to hook to it properly. I just hope that one day someone will make a proper converter.

I was struggling to get it hooked, I couldn't figure out how to get past the launcher. If you have any tips or can post a screenshot of your Ninja settings it would be awesome!

I found i had to have ninja ripper running and have already set the game location and rip directory first (and tried to run the game from it - at which point it crashes). 

This seems to store the last settings so when you run auto injector, you should see injection sucessful when the game loads.

its still not ripping correctly from what I can tell (pinged OP a message on reddit where its gaining traction). 

hoping the in game rips look as good as the viper rip he's done.
