- Post Title: CDI game RTR/RTF files

On some CDI games there are RTF and RTR files, like in the zelda games:



In Hotel Mario some of the animations(?) are stored in RTF, not the document type because it shows garbage when opening in libreoffice.



Is there any info on these formats? I'm pretty sure they are compressed cus they don't have recognizable headers or any readable text/data when looking at them in a HEX editor.

Hello! I have the same problems as you. I can't convert the .rtr file to music type or image type. Have you fix these problems already?
