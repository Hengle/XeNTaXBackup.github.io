- Post Title: 007 From Russia With Love STR Models!

Hello everyone, thanks to DJ Normalitywe've finally made some progress on cracking the models for From Russia With Love on the gamecube! 

I've attached a zip with the sample files, both the str as well as the extracted contents of them as well. Right now issue is decoding face buffers, seem to be tri-strip but not sure. Hoping someone can take a look at help us out on this!

Sorry to bump this old thread, but there hasn't been anyone reaching out to me about this and I'm still interested in this. I'm willing to pay a decent amount of money to anyone who can look into this for me (and possibly even the other EA 007 games). We can discuss these details in PM if anyone'd like but I thought I'd put the message out there that there's a good amount of money involved in this now if anyone is willing to look into these files.
