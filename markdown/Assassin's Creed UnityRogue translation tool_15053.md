Hello. I don't know much about if there is a way to import and export text files from the Anvil engine, but some say there is a Turkish guy who was able to extract and put back localization files from AC Unity. I know he did not publicate his tool, and to be honest, i don't wanna mess around with sending and waiting for the files to test them, so my question is: is there a public tool for translating these games?

Never understood why make a tool for a game if the creator is not planning to sell it, or release it for the community. waste of time. It's like i finishing a translation of a game just for myself. But it's your business, i respect your choice.

Close this thread please.

Reason is simple, we made a czech localization fo AC games and i made tool but not public coz it was not usable for anyone else, hard to use it. But i released archive repacker...

I did not make/made tool for Assassins Creed games! I have tools for AC games, that's true, but because not I made them, I cannot share them either. Also these are not user friendly at all!
