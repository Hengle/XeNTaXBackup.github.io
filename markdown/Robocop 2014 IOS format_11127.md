- Post Title: Robocop 2014 IOS format

Hey Everyone.

 well I bought and then cracked open the Robocop IOS game that's come out before the movie. the Game Engine is undoubtedly Unity3D as specified by the main file hub that lists it as such and all models are in the .43 format,much like in Fast and Furious IOS game that came out last year.

 Unlike Fast and Furious,however, this game's .43 format doesn't like my 3d max importer which worked perfectly for FF. here's the error I get to help those who would help me.

 "--runtime error:vertex index in face out of range [19525,1,1]"

 I am using 3d studio max 9 (student copy) 

 anyways I am providing a sample of the models (with texture files) for use in research. my hope is to get them into 3d max and then redesign them for use in other games. any help would be greatly appreciated

Unity importer works perfect. Tried it last week. Only thing wrong is that it doesn't have bone weighting for this game.
