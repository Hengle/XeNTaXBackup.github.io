- Post Title: How to open .lzap /.pkm files?

Game: AFK Arena 
Now, ive seen a thread answering this question, but only partly. 
[This](https://github.com/bartlomiejduda/Tools/blob/master/NEW%20Tools/AFK%20Arena/AFK_Arena_LZAP_script.bms) script can decompress .lzap files into .pkm files (script executable with [quickbms](http://aluigi.altervista.org/quickbms.htm))
but i am stuck here.
Though the thread says "Raw texture cooker" should open the pkm file, it just doesnt work. 
When i open the file and click convert, nothing happens.

[Here ](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/19z6xC0EV4IY15v4b-rRztNV7uv0sR85g) is a link to the file, once in lzap and once in the decompressed pkm 

Can anybody help me with this?

You can open / convert the. pkm files to .png files using the PKMtoPNG application:

I used it without any problems.

False positive detection.

Noesis has batch processing Tools>Batch Process

but noesis opens the file you provided with a skew (although the files from the github opens correctly)
