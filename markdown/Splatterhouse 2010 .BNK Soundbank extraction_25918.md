Hello everyone,

I am trying to extract SFX from .bnk WWISE soundbanks from Splatterhosue 2010. I actually did this successfully about 10 years ago using a version of wwise (I think) but I can for the life of me find the files. Unfortunately I cannot find a build of wwise for the xbox 360 era. and all of the scripts and tools I have tried don't work. I have gotten Wwise-Unpacker-1.0.3 to extract some files but they just play garbled almost like it extracted data tracks instead of SFX tracks. Is there anyone who would be able to help me extract the audio from the game files? Let me know what I can do to assist and I can share what I have. Thank you so much.
