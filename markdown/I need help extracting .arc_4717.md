The 360 uses a different encryption then what people are familiar with here.. 

It is believed to be very similar to a common compression method often used in many other games however it is to different for anyone here to really figure out. Nothing is impossible but, one would need to figure that problem out first before anyone could do anything with those files.  If you check the devil may cry 4 thread, you will see lots of talk on this subject... and one of the main guys on this thread was able to write a script for re5/dmc4/lost planet (also check re5 arc thread) , but he was unsuccessful at figuring out the encryption used in the 360 version (and he is not the only one to have tried).  If someone could figure it out, it would be great (hell i even at one point tried my hand it; I myself was not aware of the different compression and thought it would not be that hard a thing to do); I wanted to see the newly included 3d models (i really like to see how this stuff is made and love everything resident evil) and later perhaps rig some new mods for re4... at this point re5 modding is stuck at simple reskinning of the textures.

-hope this helps
