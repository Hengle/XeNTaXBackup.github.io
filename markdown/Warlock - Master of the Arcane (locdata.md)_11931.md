- Post Title: Warlock - Master of the Arcane (locdata.md)

Hi guys,

Does anybody knows how to edit locdata.md from this game? I've found tools for packing/unpacking .pack archives and xml to binary (and vice versa) convertor, but none for .md file.


EN, PL and RU file for comparison in PM

Thanks
