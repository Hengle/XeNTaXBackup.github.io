Can you help convert to 3DS this 3d models?
this is weapons:
SAWEDOFF
44AUTOMAG
12GAUGE
I want to create hd skins for them. but for this, I will need an available 3d format to open them in a 3d editor in order to correctly fit the texture.

Thanks. Could you send a 3ds file? It would be convenient for me to check whether I have changed the texture correctly by looking at the model in real time.
