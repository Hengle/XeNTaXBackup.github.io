- Post Title: Naruto Ultimate Ninja Storm 1 leaked models?

Hello guys, how are you?
So let's start, I have a friend who was messing with old files/old stuff and found some leaked files probably from the earliest beta version of STORM 1, from what i heard it must be the game devkit, leaked by someone who translated the beta version of the game into English.
Those are the files before being compressed in the game data format (i just uploaded naruto's samples due to bad connection, but there are a bunch more.) PS: it looks like zabuza and haku were originally planned to be in the game.



Could you guys help me to at least visualize those models or even convert them to OBJ? i couldn't see anything so far in model ressearcher.
I could upload more samples as soon as i can once you guys ask me.

I checked nrtbod1-model.dat and for me it looks like anim data (search for 2E0000 14 020100 which separates the file into blocks).
