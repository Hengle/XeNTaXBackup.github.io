- Post Title: Add Modern Warfare 2 2009 Language

I would like to download the AssMan (aka Asset Manager) program. Currently, there is no Korean language for Modern Warfare 2 2009. So I want to open the font file and study it, but no matter how much I google the Asset Manager program, I can't find it. Anyway, I want to add the Korean language for Modern Warfare 2 2009.

My questions are
1. i figured out that the fonts are in gamefonts_pc.iwi.
But where is the script for the in-game dialog?
2. where on earth can I get the Asset Manager's program?
