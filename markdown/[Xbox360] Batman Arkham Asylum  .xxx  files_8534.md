Hi,

I have Batman: Arkham Asylum's translated .upk files for PC. I want to use them on Xbox360 but Xbox360's files aren't .upk they are .xxx .

How can i use these upk files on Xbox? Can i convert or repack them to .xxx? Otherwise is it impossible?

Well it's possible if you figured out the xbox format sufficiently well...
I mean if OP is really motivated and really wants to do it I'm sure he could pull it off.
