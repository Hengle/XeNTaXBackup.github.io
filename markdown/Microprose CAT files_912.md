- Post Title: Microprose CAT files

Hi There!

I've been reading in this tread [viewtopic.php?t=830](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?t=830) , that it is possible to read Gunship and M1TP CAT files using MultiEx Commander. I've downloaded the lastest version, and the patch, all to no avail. I'm trying to access 1944 Across the Rhine, which was one of the very first MPC 3dz format games, and seems to have the same CAT files which are in Gunship, and M1TP, but I can't seem to find the correct patch which allows me to even access Gunship. Could you give me a pointer as to what to do, or where to go to find the correct settings to allow me to read these CAT files?

Do this:

1) Run Multiex
2) Click 'Web', 'Check for update'
3) Wait for that to finish, then...
4) Click 'Tools', 'Options', and deselect 'Check files info ascending'
5) Then, click 'Open'.
6) In the Open dialog, click the 'Files of type' combobox and select 'Gunship!'
7) Then, open images.cat or images1.cat
