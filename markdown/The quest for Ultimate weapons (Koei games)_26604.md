- Post Title: The quest for Ultimate weapons (Koei games)

Hi, I've been researching for the last couple months ways to extract models from Koei games (namely, Dynasty/Samurai/Warriors Orochi series). The tools Im using so far are QuickBMS, Cethleann and Steven's Gas Engine from XNLara forums. So far, the tools have kinda worked, and I can get (almost) all weapon models Im after. There are several issues, though: NONE of the tools are able to extract the final weapons of ALL titles. Im not sure if this is an issue with how the tools are coded, or if Im doing something wrong. If anyone here was able to fully extract all weapons from any Koei games of the series mentioned above, please post here on the steps needed to make it work, or at least the ID of any in any game so I can track it.

Hello!
I was also able to extract a basic character model for the PC version of WO3U using Cethleann. However, I could not confirm the character model of the DLC costume.
Were you able to get all the models including the DLC? If so, could you please tell me how to do it?

Also, I haven't been able to confirm the weapon model, and the only way I can think of is to forcibly extract it using something like NinjaRipper.
