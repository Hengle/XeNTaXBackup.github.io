- Post Title: Resident Evil: ORC Animations

So, I really love RE:ORC's animations and I wanna have them available to look at any time but the format of its animations is very unknown
I'm attaching an example archive with 2 example animsets, one with 5 files and second one with 3 files
quick note: .ssg files are actually game archives but they are not encrypted or compressed in any way as far as I know, also the only existing quickbms script to extract .ssg files gives an error on reading file names so I assume this particular archives are different from ordinary .ssg files which contain some files in them
I have no idea what .dbgproj and .proj files are and I dont really know if they are needed for animation reverse engineering but im still gonna include them
example1 are zombie animation files while example2 is something I dont know what exactly but I assume its some generic humanoid animations
most of the animation sets has .anims.ssg, .dbgproj.ssg, .proj.ssg, .smd and _d.smd files while RERC animation set from example2 has only .anims.ssg, proj.ssg and a bin file which has the same header as .smd files from other animation sets
and also, the .smd files included in the archive are not valve's smd animation files (obviously)
I really hope someone can help me in achieving my little dream
