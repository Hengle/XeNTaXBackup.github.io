depends on your 3D app. From blender I know you can flip ("standard") normals there.
Instead of flipping bump normals I'd inverse the bump map (invert colors, black to white and w to b or google for it).

(If you understand the 3D data in the model file you could multiply the bump normals with -1.0
but that would be tricky, I guess and I didn't test it.)

seems like non of these work for me but i found a way to fix that i imported a model into AC3D and unwelded the entire model then export it and opened in zmodeler then used multiple target weld and it worked perfect.   the result

well, seems I completly missed what your problem was.
I thought the deepenings should be turned up.

Pretty waste of life and time...
