- Post Title: naming format / extension for Injectors

How should i name files that are ripped?
currently if i find an OGG file with jaeder naub it now names it
ogg_F7709_4257.ogg

if it was found on F7709 and was 4257 in length.
i would like to name them so other injector tools
are supported. throw them all here so i can make
them as optional supported naming formats.

Strobe, it looks like you have an internet problem. 

I would like to offer you to host your programs at XeNTaX (freely). You could link then to the files here. 

Just let me know.

Im posting from a local computer in the city.
So i cannot post attachments or something (or download) , it really suxx.
i hope i will get it back soon :/

and btw, the format has been changed to a more readable (and was easier to make it injectable) to example: name_193831_24814.bmp
using Decimals instead of hex.

the injector section of JaederNaub is done =D

the only good thing with not having internet at home is that
, instead of surfing i code on the program :X
