- Post Title: Dance x Mixer and Lost media 3D model

Hi, I'm totally new here, but I hope to seek help..

So this is a very long story, but I have this ''rare'' game i'm looking to rip the content of it, this game is called Dance x Mixer and theres is almost no documentation about it online and almost no ressource on it. not so long ago, to prevent lost media, I reuploaded the game on my Deviant art page. This ''game'' was used to make Music video with dancing anime girl, it is kinda the prequel of Time leap Paradise, both game made by Front wing. so Basically, i'm looking for someone that could write us a noesis plugin that could read a custom 3D format made for Dance x Mixer (I'm even considering commision) so if you know anyone that could help me, please tell me

We found a Tool Online for Time Leap Paradise that let us decompile the ''pac'' file of the game which let us view the content of the game, but the 3D model format is in .xb which seems like a custom made format.

The main Reason why I want to rip that game is because I really like the artstyle of it and i'm looking to make custom animation in other program, but mostly the Lost media Part

You see, that game was available for 150$ back then, it was a total flop, dev apparently had to refund people who bought the game, but most importantly, is the DLC, that are currently Lost Media. Most popular of them all is the VOCALOID DLC model Hatsune Miku And Gumi Megpoid, but since it's discontinuation in 2012, no reupload of theses file resurface, but recently I got contacted by someone who apparently has them with video proof !

so that's why i'm here to seek help, to try and preserve it but I can't do that all alone, I have no programming skill

so, hope to find some help here!
