- Post Title: Voice files for Commissar Lord Bern Voice Files from (Dawn of War II)

I actually don't have Dawn of War 2 so I can't extract it directly.

Videos which feature his quotes have loud music and they feature no download link in the description.

If anybody has the voice files for Commissar Lord Bern from (Dawn of War II), would it be okay if you can share the files via mega.nz or google drive? 

It would be extremely appreciated.
