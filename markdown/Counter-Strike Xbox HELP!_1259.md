Sorry, did not mean not to respond. It's just that we were all busy (and some of us still are) working on a new project that takes some time.

hi again! Mack here! can you guys help us csx modders out? we use your program full throttle, but its just not enough to actually mod this thing! We need recompiling, probably the most important thing in csx modding, because it takes up to a minute to load a game with a few new models, and always gettin these errors about not being able inject and stuff, just please support recompiling, then i can host examples of my mods, then other people will want to do it like Snowfox   and they will pay for your program, but ive not been able to show them any examples due to the lack of options while modding csx, so please make recompiling for csx!
