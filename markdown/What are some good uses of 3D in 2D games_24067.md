- Post Title: What are some good uses of 3D in 2D games?

Hi I am currently on my last year of university and I am creating a project that is based around the idea of creating a 2D game in VR. I have some ideas for games to look into such as super paper mario with its 2D and 3D perspectives.

I just need some more games that have a mixture of 2D and 3D space so that I can research into how they use this.

Good ideas for how this can be done are also welcome

Thank.
