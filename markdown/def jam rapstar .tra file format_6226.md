Why don't you just download the OST   ,i think it will be a lot easier to just download the original soundtrack

As bxaimc replied to your same question before, [viewtopic.php?f=17&t=5520](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=17&t=5520) , the vgmstream plugin (hcs64.com/files/vgmstream/) for Winamp can handle these files.  Using that plugin with Winamp's File Writer plugin you can output the files to WAV (and maybe MP3).

Be sure to read the readme.txt file closely in the vgmstream archive.
