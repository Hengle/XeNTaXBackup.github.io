Hello! I am trying to experiment with the .abk files from Need for Speed: Carbon. Specifically, the engine sounds. I was looking to replace samples in the .abk files for a friend of mine for a mod, as well as something I wanted to experiment with. But for the LIFE of me, I can't find a way to encode the samples into the .abk files. Here's an example of a sound I was trying to import: [http://prntscr.com/j297df](http://prntscr.com/j297df)

And here's the result: [http://prntscr.com/j297q8](http://prntscr.com/j297q8)

Does anyone know of an encoder that can insert samples into the .abk files for Carbon?
