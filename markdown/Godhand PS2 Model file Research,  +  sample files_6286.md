The .dat files must be decompressed.
After that you should find .md files which are the templates and .tm3 which are texture files.

I no longer have the method of exporting the .dat files, there were people who were parsing this file on wiki.ps23dformat
but for some time now this wiki is no longer active, I suggest you try this site which may have saved something from this wiki [http://web.archive.org/web/*/https://ps ... spaces.com](http://web.archive.org/web/*/https://ps23dformat.wikispaces.com)

You may fiddle around with the offset but I think it's a matter of color depth and/or resolution.

I found the script that extracts the .dat file, but I don't know who wrote the script .bms, I believe it is the owner of the ps23dformat wiki, but I may be wrong.

There's some point clouds to be found in the model file but I don't have the time to care for the face indices (autocreated ones tend to be ugly):
