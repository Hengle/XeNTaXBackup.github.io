- Post Title: [xbox] Halo 2 Beta .map archives

I have a few of halo 2 beta maps but none of the standard .map extractors will read this. I tried to change the header of the file to match halo 2's but it still failed to load. I think it's more similar to halo 1's .map format.

Halo 2 Xbox Map File.

I'll add a halo 1 xbox map file image later. Is there any way to legally upload a sample?

There are some cool things in the halo 2 beta I would like a model of.

Thanks
