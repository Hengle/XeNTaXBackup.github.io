- Post Title: Beyblade Metal Fight Portable .add archive

Hello everyone, I have basically completed a translation of the Beyblade Metal Fight game for PSP "Metal Fight Beyblade Portable - Chouzetsu Tensei Vulcan Horuseus". On YouTube if you search Beyblade PSP translation you will easily find the hack. Now I would like to add mods to the game. The issue is that the game contains .add files which I don't know how to properly decrypt. These .add files contain .gim,.gmo, and .vag files. I have extracted these from the .add archive before using HxD but I need an easier/faster way to decompile and I also need a way to recompile the .add file. When I try to extract the .add normally, (adding a .rar extension to the end and then extracting it). Only the first file within the archive is extracted. When I try to replace a .add file within the .iso, with a prexisting one, it only changes the first file within the archive. For example I tried to do a voice swap. Only one voice clip changed the rest were silent because the game for some odd reason could not read past the encoding when I swapped the files. Any tips, advice would be a great help. If possible a tool to handle these files would be super useful and could perhaps be the start of a new modding community. Thanks in advanced for anyone who gives this post the time of day!

Also if you would like to look at one of the files just reply, I'll have to upload it elsewhere since Xentax doesn't let me upload the .add files.

Here is what an example of a file looks like in HxD
[HxD - [E__Metal Fight Bayblade Portable - Chouzetsu Tensei Balkan Horuseus (Japan)_PSP_GAME_USRDIR_data_10KyoBattle.add] 8_25_2023 12_47_31 AM.png](https://xentaxbackup.github.io/file/24266_HxD - [E__Metal Fight Bayblade Portable - Chouzetsu Tensei Balkan Horuseus (Japan)_PSP_GAME_USRDIR_data_10KyoBattle.add] 8_25_2023 12_47_31 AM.png)
