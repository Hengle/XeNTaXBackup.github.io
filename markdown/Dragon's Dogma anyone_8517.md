- Post Title: Dragon's Dogma anyone?

It appears Capcom is trying their hands at yet a new game series, Dragon's Dogma. The open world setting looks pretty good and people are already saying it looks like Skyrim. Some of the models look cool imo. What do you think?

the game looks like it has a lot of potential but i always look at trailers and don't set my hopes to high.
if they can deliver on all the promises it will be a very good game for sure.
on a side note watched singham its great.

Agreed. Capcom does have a history of a lovely show case but then you get the opposite. Hopefully DD can be what CapC. is stating. 
Oh yes Singham is awesome. ^^
