- Post Title: Help with project IGI textures and models

I've managed to extract the models and textures via an extractor i found on this site
But the models i got were *.mef, and the textures were *.tex
Has anyone ever found a converter?
If not, Can you please work on it a bit? Shouldn't take long, It's a very old game...And i don't think it's a very complex structure...
Attached is a rar with 2 files, A texture and a model, I'm not sure they're related, They might just have the same name because they are indexed inside the archive

Model file is chunk based format, but there aren't any chunk sizes so I guess you'd end up scanning the file for all the chunks and then figure out what they are, no convenient "skip chunk section" methods for testing.

There seems to be a lot of indexing going on, so skimming over the file doesn't really give me any ideas.
Maybe someone will try it out.

Post more model samples. Preferably a dozen small ones of increasing size and maybe a few large ones.
That is mainly for comparison to find patterns.

there you go, 6 of the smallest, and 6 of the largest, same for the textures, so you have 24 files here...just choose the ones you want, i had to split it because it is more than 256 KB(WTF? its a small attachment)
so it will come in 3 posts...

Well I found some pattern, but still a lot of unknowns.

Some outline I wrote out:

```

#header
dword chunk "ILFF"
dword filesize
dword 4
dword unk
dword chunk "OCEM"

#chunk starts
char_4 chunk
dword chunkSize - 16
dword 4
dword chunkSize

chunkSize Chunk {
   data
}

```


The face section is all weird.
I found this forum which talks about IGI2, and they appear to HAVE TOOLS for it, but there's absolutely no information on the format. You might have better luck there, though if they're anal about things they might just keep everything private private.

It's not a script, just an outline.

I see.

Well, aside from the fact that it's chunk-based, I don't really know enough common patterns to be able to figure out the structures.
