And how would one go about doing that? There's only this one song I want (the one in the 4th video on the Just Cause site, its sort of tropical island-ish with a choir sound)

So,

Might you be kind enough to give a detailed step by step guide to extracting the files mentioned? and include the software involved?

Cheers.

I tried opening the big SAB file and my problem is:

I am trying to extract the music in archive Just Cause\PC\SFX\Music\music.sab I get the "PGN Invalid" error.

There is no tab or text file... can someone help me out here with those text/tab files/whatever? I am a complete nubcake with no idea how to edit anything or hex anything or whatever.

Ok, I installed OGGENC to D:\Just Cause\PC\Sfx\Music and inputted the string and spat out music.ogg, when I go to play the file, it plays extremely fast like its the wrong sampling rate or something. Do I change the ext. to RAW? If I should change the sampling rate, what should it be?

Don't worry for the speed of the speech, the game works fine, try to put the "new .sab" into the game and run the game (make backup of the files)
