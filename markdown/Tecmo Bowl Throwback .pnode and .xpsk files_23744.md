- Post Title: Tecmo Bowl Throwback .pnode and .xpsk files?

figured i'd post this anywhere i can think to get help with it at, I was trying to get models from the XBLA version of Tecmo Bowl Throwdown, surprisingly most of the files are not compressed and can just be accessed as .dds for textures and .pnode in the "objects" folder for all the models and seems to be .xpsk for "animations", I was wondering if there is some sort of viewer for this or way to get them into a usable format? here are some example files
