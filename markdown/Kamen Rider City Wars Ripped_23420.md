Hello, can I ask how to get the Model and Audio from Kamen Rider City Wars ? I read the article discussing this game, but I don't know how and how to do it. Can you help me by showing you with pictures? That will make it easier for me to understand. I hope everyone will show me how to get the Model and the bones. Thanks.

Ah, I haven't installed the submesh yet but how do I install it? Use Code :: Block to compile it into support files for the make_obj?

You need to know 'C' (a programming language) to use CodeBlocks.
(If you don't know 'C': it's a rather long way to learn it, usually takes months.)

I opened something in Code: Block and I saw the Script section, I changed it by pasting Patch. But the model does not separate.
Btw, I have learned about C programming language.

If you uploaded the model I could check it.

btw: hex2obj has no "get the bones" feature, it's just for getting meshes/uvs

Then the 2nd mesh of MDL__B00092_92.prefab (shirt) should be created. (Worked for me.)

Had no other models to test, afair, so no guarantee that it works for other models.

I'd need the prefab file! (The Makeobj_log.obj is of little use for me other than asking: "what do you miss? The result looks complete to me."

I am trying to fix the compile and it looks like it is faulty or has some problem.
If possible, can you pre-patch the code into the Make_obj software? I think it will work once you have pre-patched it and gave it to me ("Maybe it won't work"), but I hope you can help me with that! Thanks.

Prefab file : http://www....Thanks! 

> I am trying to fix the compile and it looks like it is faulty or has some problem.Could you be more specific, please? There should be no problem compiling the patched code when you just replace the old function void SM_of_KR_CW_loop() by the patched one.
btw: I used the compiled exe as of Sept. 14 th, 2019 ("one SM only"-version) and it produces the same Makeobj_log.obj as the one you uploaded.

> If possible, can you pre-patch the code into the Make_obj software?May take some time. Your prefab "breaks" the patched code. 

Maybe it doesn't have a 2nd submesh? The max vertex count might be 65404, while without the patch we get 28225 vertices only.

(Cool, that you engage in this (KR) 2nd submesh problem, there's only few people who did.)

-----------------------------------
well, from a rough check:
vertices 0x643574, count: 28225

0x86498 trans/rotmat?
0x86A10 DWord strlen, ... TransformRotationEulerLinker, 4490 times!

0x513223..565d2e, 28225 normals

0x565d89..5d4199, Tangents 28225  stride 16

block size 0x52b0c
0x5d41f4..626d00 binormals 28225

I'd conclude: there's no 2nd submesh. There's one mesh/ 2 objects: npc and animal

Dunno where this face index 65404 comes from. Maybe check that later ...

If you have any news please let me know, I look forward to a lot of you in this help.
The 2nd Submesh I have patched on but it still has problems not splitting (This is because of me or my computer can not compile). I also find it strange that some people completely got it without the same problem as me. Thanks

The news is in my previous post. There won't be any other as long I don't have exact information about existing problems.

Can you compile the unpatched source?

> I also find it strange that some people completely got it without the same problem as me. ThanksWhich model are you talking about? For MDL__B00092_92.prefab (which is the only two-mesh-model I could test) it works:

btw: if people are asking themselves why I don't simply upload the compiled exe:
it doesn't make sense because it's tested with the above two-mesh-model only.

As long as I don't have other two_or_more mesh models I can't proceed.

Hey, can you help me? This Prefab file, when put into Make_Obj, there was one missing thing when outputting obj file. I do it again and again so I check the File size, the Prefab File is about 6MB, but the file output is 1.5MB, "Pet" is missing. Can you help me transfer it to OBJ and still keep everything? Thanks for the help.
Prefab File : [Not available anymore]

Where is that "Pet"? Can you give the start address of a vertices point cloud?

(what I find is "pEt", it's not a string but part of a float value, 70 45 74 BF)

I don't know where it is but that Lion is below the character.

I don't know, but that Lion is in the prefab file. And I don't know anything more. I just hope you can help me solve this "Pet" problem.

How do you know about that Lion?

Other than the vertex block at 0x602568 (19709 vertices, FVFsize = 12)
all I see is Bi-/Normals, Tangents, compare my rough check from another model:

But you may find in MDL__R00469_000069.prefab some other vertices at: 0x49aa87; maybe try different strides.

I know that Pet is a "Lion" through a few videos. I don't know where it is, but I see the Texture with it in it.

Sadly those 13139 vertices at 0x49AA8B  don't look like a lion, much worse, they don't look like any pet.

I don't know, but its whole body looks like it's been transformed by bones (This might be) I came across some videos of the beast's lower body with its belt and legs turned downwards. Here are some pictures of both the beast and the human figure.

I don't think it was due to the lion's skeleton, I think it lost parts of it. And have you found a way to solve that problem?

As always you'll need the skeleton before. For this format it looks a  little bit confusing. Search for jointroot to understand, why.
To reduce the results search for jointroot/hip/legup_l or foot_L for example.

Build the skeleton by names. Then search for the bones' (i.e. joints') matrices (translation/rotation values, floats usually).

A long way to go.

(I'd start with a prefab file with less joints, btw.)
