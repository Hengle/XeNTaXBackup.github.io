- Post Title: F.E.A.R. 3 The Hammer Model/SFX

I'm currently looking to make Paxton Fettel's handgun a replacement for Left 4 Dead 2's Desert Eagle, but since the files don't exist without the pre-order code or collector's edition. I was wondering if anyone would be willing to assist me with ripping the model, If you send me the "DLC_WP3.dsPack" Dragon Unpacker could probably nab the sound effects and If we did multiplayer Ninja Ripper could rip the model from there.
