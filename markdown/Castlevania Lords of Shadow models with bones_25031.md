- Post Title: Castlevania Lords of Shadow models with bones

Hi I've been ripping models from games that I like to 3d print, I've been trying to get a few from Castlevania Lords of Shadow, I've managed to get the models, using a script for Quicbms to extract the files from the .dat files in the install location, I then used a script for 3DSMAX to take the, i believe, SM3 files ad convert them to FBX, so that I can then import them into blender with the intention of posing them how I want, ready for 3D printing however, I've run into a small problem that the script I use doesn't get the bones. 
Is there any way to get the FBX with bones?
I managed to find the scripts for QuickBMS and 3DSMax in [viewtopic.php?f=16&t=5236&p=174015&hili ... OW#p174015](https://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=5236&p=174015&hilit=castlevania+LORDS+OF+SHADOW#p174015)
I do want to say that I have almost no idea what it is i'm doing I'm just googling how to do things and hoping for the best.
