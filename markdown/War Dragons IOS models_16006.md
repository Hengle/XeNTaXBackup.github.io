- Post Title: War Dragons IOS models

I've been trying to find a way to get into the game files to rip the models, a lot of things seems already decompressed as the majority of the GUI elements are in simple .png format. it's easy to get ahold of the .apk and extract it like a rar or zip archive.

Right now the file formats I can't open are .POD, .entitlements, .csv, .ccbi, .apvr, .epvr, and .part files.
There are also .scene files but i'm not necessarily worried about them, as I suspect those are just what the extension suggests they are- scenes. I've been able to find, generally, nothing on these file formats so far.

Edit: Apparently they used something called the "Mantis Engine" not sure if anyone's ripped from any of their other games.

Does anyone know anything about any of these file formats, or would anyone like to help me take a look? The models don't look -horrible-  they're actually nicely animated for an ios game where i've come to expect nothing but stiff and horrible models/animations.
