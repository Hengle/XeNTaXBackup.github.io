- Post Title: List of Unity games

> Unity is a game development ecosystem: a powerful rendering engine fully integrated with a complete set of intuitive tools and rapid workflows to create interactive 3D and 2D content; easy multiplatform publishing; thousands of quality, ready-made assets in the Asset Store and a knowledge-sharing community.You can read more about it on [http://www.unity3d.com](http://www.unity3d.com).

As this game engine grows more and more popular, I think we should make a list of Unity games that have interesting models, which can be imported with my MAXScript - info [here](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=11095) and direct download [here](https://www.mediafire.com/folder/y2id147f8iqe0//Latest%20release)

Instructions on downloading and extracting games
PC, OSX & Linux - download the game from wherever and the contents should already be available in a Data folder
Android - Since Chrome doesn't allow unverified extensions anymore, the APK Downloader won't work unless you're using Canary.
Luckily there's an easier way with http://apps.evozi.com/apk-downloader/. Simply enter the app URL from Google Play and start the download.
Change the extension from .apk to .zip and extract.
Note: some games/apps download additional content after they are installed. Usually it's in the form of .obb files which are just zip archives.
iOS - the only way I know is through iTunes; install it, create an account (preferably US or UK) and browse the store. Downloaded apps are stored in \My Music\iTunes\iTunes Media\Downloads
Change the extension from .ipa to .zip and extract them.
Note: some games/apps download additional content after they are installed. I don;t know of any way to get this content without actually installing them.
Xbox 360 - use the usual Xbox tools to extract the game (wxPirs). Files are inside a folder called Media instead of Data
Web - this is probably the hardest one, or at least the most tedious
Download, install and run URLsnooper2 - you may have to restart
Under "Protocol filter" select "Show all" and then press "Sniff Network"
Load the game in your browser - if it doesn't work in Chrome try IE or FF
Some Web games won't load all assets at once. For example, a car configurator will download additional files after you change car options
Select the files you need in URL Snooper, right click and copy to clipboard. Then you can download them one by one or use a download manager
Put all files in one folder and use aluigi's QuickBMS and unity3d extraction script. If it doesn't work try the Unity 3D Obfuscator. Also have a look at my modified version of the script that fixes some issues: [viewtopic.php?p=93230#p93230](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?p=93230#p93230)

There is of course a list of Unity games [on the official website](http://unity3d.com/gallery/made-with-unity/game-list), but it barely scratches the surface.
I'll start with a couple of iOS and Android games and apps designed to showcase different car models. Some are low-poly, others are more than decent.

Is there a way to find more car configurators like that?
How were Porsche and Scion found?

Porsche and Scion were found by some friends of mine. Google doesn't help much because car manufacturers don't use the terms "3D car configurator".
Your only chance is to sip through official websites and check what configurators they have.

In iTunes and Google Play I usually search for "configurator" "augmented reality" or "360 3D".

hehehe well will your friends know some more? 
Do you think each web configurator of one brand is the same in each country? For example will Mercedes be the same stuff in Canada, as in Brazil or Austria? I am afraid they ll all have the same configurator, right?

Well if they find more I'll post here. 

Configurators can be different because in each country there's a different marketing team. That's probably why the Scion configurator is only available in Canada. Also, many AR apps on iTunes are "region locked"

Hey Chipicao,
thanks for the links 
Any chance to get the models out of a flash / swf or java file as well?
Something like this for example

Unfortunately that's not a 3d model. It's just a series of images from different angles.

Sure it is possible. AFAIK Flash supports 3D. Here's an example: [http://www.nissan-stagejuk3d.com/](http://www.nissan-stagejuk3d.com/)
Unity can also compile games into flash, but I have never seen any.

As for getting them out, again, anything is possible. The problem is getting someone to do it

Actually it doesn't contain any car models. After you install it, the app is supposed to download additional .unity3d files which hold car models and other things.
If you look inside \Payload\NBGI0160.app\Data\Raw\AssetBundle\iPhone\ you'll see two such files that can be extracted with aluigi's script. One of this files contains the garage.
[](http://www.imagebam.com/image/87472c309940597) 

I'm not sure where exactly they are downloaded as I don't own any iOS devices, but I've seen someone do it with the [ŠKODA Interactive Catalogue](http://new.skoda-auto.com/en/experience/mobile-apps/interactive-catalogue).

Which brings me back to Pfreak's question. Skoda is another manufacturer who launched Unity car configurators. This particular app has the Citigo, Octavia, OctaviaRS, Rapid, Rapid Spaceback, Superb and Yeti (+ 3/5 door variants where available). Anyone interested in the models - PM me.
[](http://www.imagebam.com/image/ecccc9309919435) [](http://www.imagebam.com/image/332bc7309919447) [](http://www.imagebam.com/image/fdc0cc309919455) [](http://www.imagebam.com/image/d7ad23309919478) [](http://www.imagebam.com/image/b8e28d309919504) [](http://www.imagebam.com/image/387228309919515) 

And on their Indian website there's another Web app for the new Oktavia with full-3D interior and opening doors: [http://skodaindia.tv/skodaapp/web.html](http://skodaindia.tv/skodaapp/web.html)
[](http://www.imagebam.com/image/2a6cbd309919543) [](http://www.imagebam.com/image/b7f26d309919563)
You only need these 2 files:
[http://skodaindia.tv/skodaapp/Streaming ... le.unity3d](http://skodaindia.tv/skodaapp/StreamingAssets/windows/assets/bundles/ExteriorBundle.unity3d) - import node Octavia_AllVariants_Final
skodaindia.tv/skodaapp/StreamingAssets/windows/assets/bundles/InteriorBundle.unity3d - import Interior

But first download the latest script which fixes a max bug exposed by this particular app!

I didn't. A guy called redguard120 found the iOS app and showed it to me on another forum. That led me to find the Octavia web app.

After that I've been searching for "<insert car manufacturer here> 3D Visualizer", but no luck.
As I've said, every app has a different name. "3D configurator", "3D showroom", "3D Visualizer"... you just have to keep guessing. Even worse, many of them are region-locked, so you have to search on every country in iTunes.

Only if the shaders use common Unity sampler names (ex: "_SpecularMap", "gSpecularSampler", "_NormalMap" ...)

If not, you have a checkbox to extract all textures in the game, and then you can apply them manually.

It doesn't freeze, it just takes a while to load the whole game because it has a of of assets. For me it takes 2 minutes on an intel 2500K@4.2Ghz.
Just give it time. Or try loading a single level file.

I must say though, this game looks to be mostly 2D. I'm not sure what you can get out of it other than textures.

Hello I'm trying to get a look at the models from the free game called Hello Hero ([https://apps.facebook.com/hellohero_global/](https://apps.facebook.com/hellohero_global/)) but with no success. It's on iOS, Android, and Facebook via Unity Web Player plugin. I've tried following the method you mentioned to find the .unity3d file with UrlSnooper, with 3 different browsers to no avail.

I also tried downloading the iOS app again via iTunes, but the game downloads the content after you actually install the app, thus making this ineffective. I'd imagine the same is true of Android. So due to such I believe the web version is the only way.

While I couldn't find the files via Url-Snooper, the cache of the unity web player plugin folder had this large file inside (as well as a few smaller ones):

[http://www.mediafire.com/download/0eveu ... 28a6a57572](http://www.mediafire.com/download/0eveuid0kzg1zyb/CAB-755957ecaa32eb24ba6f3528a6a57572) (Weighing in at 375MB this has got to be where the models are stored.)

[http://www.mediafire.com/download/momzl ... ed1089b55b](http://www.mediafire.com/download/momzl8dh2p3re5f/CAB-5292187fc60cdce4a96fcfed1089b55b) (A smaller file, but it seems to be of similar nature. They just added a few new heroes to the game and this may contain those characters).

They appear to be .CAB archives of sorts, but I can't figure out how to extract them, I tried DisUnity, Unity Obfuscator, even both versions of aLugi's Unity script to no avail.

Can anyone figure out what I need to do to be able to look at these models in a normal 3D program?

I'd like to view them for the purpose of studying them, as reference examples for a game that I'm making. I'm curious about how the poly's flow on the models as I'm sure they are low poly just like how I'd like to make mine.

Any help would be appreciated. (Also I hope posted that cache file is fine, as it's a free game)

You don't have to extract it, just load it with my script. It will take a while because it's a big file with tens of thousands of assets, but you'll get there.

It seems to be working now, sorry I misunderstood that something had to be done before using the script. I've no idea how long it will take to import this big file, so I'm leaving and will check on it after work. Hopefully it doesn't take nearly that long.

Anyway, thank you! I'll let you know how it all goes.

@Zerox you're welcome, and good luck!

@CriticalError the game already works. You're probably having a similar issue with loading times. In this case the files aren't big but there are a lot of them, 5386 to be precise.
It took me about 5 minutes to load them all:

I use Max 9 so I unpack your MZP and use Unity_Assets.mse to load them all be ok? or I do something wrong?

Something is not right, this is what I get from the apk:
[](http://www.imagebam.com/image/361e2e317103218) 

And no, you don't have to extract the mzp. You drag&drop or run it in max, then you add the button. See the installation instructions for more details.
But the script won;t work in max 9. you need 2010 or newer.

Hello again. I stopped by to let you know that there appears to be some issues sometimes when reading the UVs of certain models as seen below:



The model's name is there in the image, and it's from that same archive I posted earlier if you'd like to take a look. Usually it's little things, and if you look on the UV editor the proper uv map still exists, it's just misplaced. I figured I'd let you know just in case it'd help you improve your script.

Either way, I'm already learning a lot from looking at the way these models are made, and slight UV issues aren't deal breaker for me, because I'm just using the models to learn more about making Chibi styled characters for my own models.

I hope this helps, I appreciate your wonderful script, thank you!

The chances that the script reads UV mapping perfectly for most of the mesh and gets it wrong for just 2 polys are very very low. Also, that doesn't look like an error because the UV is too neat.
It could be that the mesh really is made like this (modeling error) or those polys are "extra". Try to delete them and see if underneath there are two more polys with correct mapping. Let me know how it goes.

You're most welcome and thanks for the feedback.

EDIT:
I decided to check for myself, but the UV mapping looks fine on my end:
[](http://www.imagebam.com/image/6d7623317906029) 

I also noticed you're not viewing the model in max. Could it be that something went wrong when you exported it? Please check the mapping in max straight after importing.

Hmmm... Well that's odd. The oddity in the UV appeared that way even in Max, I tried converting it and viewing it in the other program to see if it'd go away. They don't seem to be extra either. I find it weird that it looks okay on your end in max. Seems a little odd, but it must be something on my end, either way I'm okay because it's uncommon and easy to fix.

Hi !

I've tried more and more times to extract a good link inside "porsche configurator content" but without results.

Link with "unity" appears in the links list of "Url Snooper" but when I copy to clipboard and launch in browser don't content nothing about 3D, only html or jscript content.

Do you can explain what's kind of link I must find in the list?

I've tried to change a rim or color in porsche configurator options ( 3D mode naturally) end saw new link appears in "snoopers" list, but nothing about 3d content.

Thanks in advance!

I'll just post what I told you in PM:

You must find URLs with .unity3d files, like this:
[](http://www.imagebam.com/image/712698254184432)

Changing the rim color probably won't give you a new unity3d link, it's just a texture/color switch.

I think they did something to the new version and car models are downloaded separately, after you install the game.

Where are the cars from Dubai Drift stored? I looked into both the .apk file and the obb directory, but all I could find is some UI textures.

Many mobile games, especially Android, don't include all graphics assets in the apk or ipa. Instead they are downloaded separately after you install the game, and you need to find them on your phone or tablet.
Dubai Drift is such an example. Android apk doesn't include cars, but the iOS ipa does.

Other games have separate .unity3d or bundle files that contain models and need to be extracted first.
For example CSR Racing 2.0.0.ipa\Payload\csr4c3.app\AppDataRoot\AssetBundles\High\
There you will find a bunch of files with extension .High.##. You need to extract all of them with aluigi's quickbms script.

@lolwatt Thanks for the feedback, I will look into Tiny Troopers to see what causes the crash.
Do you mean Edge of Tomorrow crashes as well? Last time I checked it worked fine.

Knights 1.0.13.ipa - human* meshes in resources.assets
[](http://www.imagebam.com/image/6ed8c8353582399) 

Some character skeletons indeed don't have meshes.
I can only assume that either the game engine is meant to add them together from other nodes, or perhaps they are downloaded after you unlock them.

Point is, the script is importing all meshes that it can find, and it does so based on the structure of the asset files.
If for whatever reason the game uses custom code to modify or combine meshes together, for example torsos and legs, my script cannot see that.

Real Steel 1.20.3.ipa - robots in resources.assets - look for nodes called "Robot Pelvis"
[](http://www.imagebam.com/image/55a062353582405) 


These are just a few games I checked. I don't have time for the others but they likely have meshes as well.

You just have to check all nodes and keep looking until you find what you need. Depending on how developers structure their games, model nodes can be either in level files or in .assets files.
I suggest you load the whole Data folder but don't import more than a few dozen nodes at once, max might crash.

I'm aware that for some games it's difficult to find models because my script lists all nodes in the tree hierarchy, even those that have nothing to do with models, such as camera or sound containers.
I will try to filter these out in a future release.

Hey, it's not your fault. You're using beta 5 which intentionally doesn't list .assets files when loading folders.
Update to beta 8 and you'll be good.

Yeah, you did share a lot of games, thanks for that

Cars in [Drift Spirits](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.namcobandaigames.driftspirits) on Android are downloaded for the first time before a race and stored in /data/data/com.namcobandai.driftspirits/files/UnityCache/shared (you'll need root access).
However, some textures are missing. I'm not sure if it's because they're stored somewhere else or for some other reason.

EDIT: Actually you have to load the "Car" part, for example "Car010101" for the Honda CR-Z. Then all textures will be loaded correctly. But all glass parts seem to have flipped normals for some reason.

Out of curiosity, I'm trying to rip assets from various Unity games that store most of their data on a cloud storage system, like downloading it from the cloud and into the game's main data. I'm attempting to rip from Angry Birds Epic and Penguins of Madagascar: Dibble Dash, but they both have their primary data stored outside of the main game on the iOS device. Is there a way to download that cloud data and then access the main assets from there?

Anyone have luck with the [Tekken Online Card Game](http://www.tekken-card-tournament.com/en/home) (Also on Iphone and Ipad) ?
The earlier versions were easier to extract models and animations from
But they updated to unity 4

@JohnHudeski my MAXscript and UnityStudio are fully compatible with all Unity apps up to 4.6.0, so it should work. And soon I will release updates for Unity 5 beta.

@lolwatt The same script,  unity3d_webplayer.bms
Also for .bundle or other non-standard files (for example CSR Racing uses a bunch of .High.# and .Low.# files).

So recently im "insert some nice text here" about game Dragons Wild Skies.
I can get every model but not their textures, seriously, I searched everywhere for them but there is only GUI, lightmaps and maptextures, in every asset, but no textures of props.
I tried Snooper to track them if they're downloading directly but nothing. Where are they? Does unity downloads any raw packets from server store where are assets files?

@PredatorCZ then try the ol' URLSnooper. You'll get files like:
[http://i.cdn.turner.com/toon/games/drag ... in.unity3d](http://i.cdn.turner.com/toon/games/dragons/wild-skies/main.unity3d)
[http://i.cdn.turner.com/toon/games/drag ... ge.unity3d](http://i.cdn.turner.com/toon/games/dragons/wild-skies/assets/village.unity3d)


@jmgg Are you sure that's a Unity game?

Yes, I have most of these files, but if u unpack them and import them to max or view them with your tool then there is no model textures.
I also noticed every character on spawn is blue and then textures are loaded whinch proves these textures are loaded separately from unity3d files.
But URL Snooper (like I said before) cannot track those textures.
I tried run it with texmod but its not working.

Ah, sorry, I didn't read your post thoroughly.
These textures need to come from somewhere, even if they are loaded separately. It's strange that URL Snooper doesn't pick them up.

I'll try to look into it and will let you know if I find anything.

Hello and thanks a ton for the tutorial!!! I love the Porsche models and found a lot of them online but I wanted the Cayman GT-4 to convert into rFactor. I successfully extracted it and have it now! 

A Question: Does anyone know of any other 3d car configurators out there? The ones I found are just images  I really want them if they are there!

Thanks again,

May I ask how you managed to intercept this file manifest?
Did you use a network sniffer or did you hack the iOS app somehow?

I'm interested because many mobile apps download additional files after installation.

Hmm, maybe you've seen it in my MaxScript, which also had the ability to parse any and all Unity versions 

Here's the complete structure of assetfiles (mainData, level#, .assets, .sharedAssets, CustomAssetBundle, BuildPlayer)
Note that unity 5 still needs further testing

As of yesterday, Unity Studio is also on GitHub: [https://github.com/RaduMC/UnityStudio](https://github.com/RaduMC/UnityStudio)

```

            EndianStream fileStream = new EndianStream(File.OpenRead(fileName), EndianType.BigEndian);

            int tableSize = fileStream.ReadInt32();
            int dataEnd = fileStream.ReadInt32();
            int fileGen = fileStream.ReadInt32();
            int dataOffset = fileStream.ReadInt32();

            bool baseDefinitions = false;

                        fileStream.Position += 1;
                        break;

I've updated the above code with more info on Unity 5. As far as I've tested it works with all versions.

I also released Unity Studio 0.5 with full Unity 5 compatibility. There's an included feature that should be of interest to anyone interested in the structure of Unity assets.

Looks like I'm few years late for that, but anyway.
File uses simple xor decryption

filexor "0x47"

get fsize asize
