- Post Title: Transformers: War for Cybertron repack LOC_int.xxx ?

HI, I decided to translate the game TRANSFORMERS WAR FOR CYBERTRON
I did the translation coalesced.int file
But I need the translation of the texts during the game
And the texts are in the file LOC_int.xxx
I could extract the files with the program extract.exe
Because the files xxx are the same as upk
And the edit file SoundNodeWaveEx with an editor HEX
So far so good
But the problem is I can not find how to do the repack
Anyone know how?

Thanks

Homefront and Bulletstorm was using the same engine with Transformers, I guess.
It would be good to translate the game without any character limit.

In the UDK exists a tool called UnrealLoc.exe which I think is to edit these files * LOC * but so far not understand its operation, if somebody can tell me how please.
