- Post Title: Unity Monobehaviour Files

Hi,
Hope u all are fine and safe. I was trying to get a few models of characters from Free Fire android game but what I find is "Monobehviour" files.Are they 3D Models converted in Codes?? Or are they just some sort of scripts that do something?
I've been trying to get those models for a long time now. Just want to know what are these Monobehaviour files and if we can derieve 3D models from them.
Thank You!

Monobehviour is related to programming.Models are stored in .unity3d .bundle .asset type of files.
