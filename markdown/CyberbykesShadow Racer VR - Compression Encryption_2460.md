- Post Title: Cyberbykes/Shadow Racer VR - Compression? Encryption?

The BIN files are easily understood and extracted from but some files (examples attached) are not in a format that can be used in present form. The game reads files externally bypassing the data files making it unneccesary to reinsert them into the BIN files. I know they can't be used because the game crashes stateing the file is corrupt.

So it is obviously an encryption of some sort? Any help appreciated.

It has been confirmed to be a compression. Also, there exists a debugging version of DosBox that lists the commands and exact files being accessed. It is available on VOGONs. Could this be used to find the means of decompression or does it not?

Here's an example dump I made. Would this be useful? Or useless? It's just an example log, I do not know if this method is of any use in decompression. I only know it logs the data accesses.
