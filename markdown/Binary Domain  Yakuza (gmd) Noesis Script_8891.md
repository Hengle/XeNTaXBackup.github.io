Fuckin hey man I've been waiting for this one for a whole year now lol. Feels like Christmas. Bout time as those yakuza models are niiiice. Luigi's the man lol. Of all the unfun things there are to do in this world, looking at disassembly to figure out a compression algorithm is probably #1. If me and my girl ever go to italy, remind me to buy luigi a beer lol.

As long as it's not the same shit amanda knox drank, I'm alright with it lol.  but I don't think a ton of manjuice is the official drink so it should be ok. Hahaha you guys would probaby kill me if something ever happened to luigi.

EDIT: lol, oops, wrong chick; corrected.

I'm able to use this plugin to view the models in Noesis but when I try to export them as obj, Noesis crashes. However, I was able to export to dae, then export dae to obj. 

Thanks for this chrrox!

chrrox - Thanks again for this plug-in. I was able to use it to successfully extract Dan Marshall, but it was quite messy. It seems there are several models mixed together and sharing some vertices thus making clean-up very tedious. From the image posted, it seems you know a method for fixing this problem. Can you tell me how to get rid of all the extra mesh in the model that originally renders without a texture? 

Best regards,
dragbody

Those extra meshes you see are the LOD models, when the player walks away from the character it replaces the original mesh with one of those depending on the distance you are from the model.

Yes please make the script split the lods to like Dan_LOD1,Dan_LOD2

pceedeie98 -- This thread is for a Noesis script that allows for conversion of a specific gmd format into many formats that can be loaded into Max. Please download Noesis and install the script.

chrrox -- I know you're a busy man so don't consider this a request. But I know I would be very thankful if you updated the script to only load the highest LOD. If this never happens, the original script will suffice just fine. Thank you.

Just export to OBJ and delete all the lower LODs.  They seperate out into seperate objects and tend to group together. A bit tedious, but doesn§t take too long.

Sorry for a newbie breaking into this thread, but i really like the Ryu Ga Gotoku (Yakuza) series.

At the moment i extracted Yakuza 3. QuickBMS worked fine i think because i could already extract all music and textures, which is already nice.


Well so now i tried the Noesis script that was posted on the first page. "Generally" i would say it is working. I tried only to extract scenes (love the ufo Catcher, Donkihoote Supermarket and such...).


But... Besides parts of the scene being glitched sometimes the UV mapping is screwed. Generally the textures are there, materials look fine, but the UV mapping is just weird, so it doesn't show up. I can edit the material manually, but if you know about UV mapping you also know how futile that is for bigger scenes. What is even more weird is that in the Noesis preview it shows up fine, but in the exported model its messed up. So far i tried OBJ (Doe not create mtl file!), FBX and DAE. OBJ obviously doesnt have materials at all without MTL and DAE and FBX have the UV problem...

So i would like to ask if anyone knows a trick? Or do i have an outdated version of the script?

Also with bigger scenes that have loads of textures i get that nasty "UV1 buffer would be out of bounds" error.

Shame, as I am soooo close. But without textures it looks considerably dull. Sorry so much for bothering, but any hint to help out a bloody newbie? thanks a million times in advance.

Like I've said I'm working on it. The model/environment geometry structures and bone weights rigging all have been parsed just in the process of cleaning up my code translating it to c#. That script chrrox wrote years ago is outdated just wait. Honestly though not many people have shown an interest to this hence the reason I haven't worked on it that frequently.

Well i managed to get it to create an MTL file for the obj, but that didn't improve the UV mapping problem.

Interestingly the script work 99% fine on character models, it's just the scenes/objects that end up messed up.

Not happy about having to pay €5 just to register so I can download this script, but thanks anyway. I've been looking to make Kiryu-san into an XNALara model for a while now

Noob question - why xnalara? So people swap lara croft with other characters? Or is there a deeper meaning to that format?

It's a program people use for making poses of videogame characters, like GarrysMod but easier to use and personally I think it looks a lot better for making still images with.

You can download it off TPB or TPP or whatever it's called these days, you just have to search for Ryu ga Gotoku 5 (its Japanese name) since it's not been released in the west yet.

Hi
Here is  blend file for import models from gmd files (Yakuza 5).
It requires to install Blender version 249b (32 bit) and Python 2.6.6.(32 bit).
Doubleclick file "Blender249.blend" and in Text Window press alt+p to run script.
Select file with *.gmd and press import.
Script import geometry, uv ,weights for vertex and bones.
Not all bones are joined.

Tosyk; I don't think the script is compatible with non-character models, it has been tried before.

Please don't use portable software only installed. Or copy all files (replace old newGameLib with new) to folder with blender.exe .
But i prefer to install Blender version 32 bit and Python 2.6.6. 32 bit.

1. sadly, non-character models are still not working properly with this script. The old noesis script can import the geometry for most non-character models, but there's no UV mapping and 3 sets of identical geometry baked down into a single mesh, which obviously means a hell of a lot of work if you want to get it into a decent looking model. 

2. You definitely don't need a 2nd UV channel for the normal maps; they use the same UV coordinates as the diffuse, spec and AO maps. There are mini repeating bump/diffuse/spec maps used to give more detail to certain materials, but that's not the same thing.

There's UV mapping, but not for all meshes.

And adding the type 0xF4 to the script like such will show up more UV maps:

```
			rapi.rpgBindUV1BufferOfs(VertBuff, noesis.RPGEODATA_HALFFLOAT, fvfInto[i][4], (fvfInto[i][4] - 8))
		if fvfInto[i][8] == 0xF4:
			rapi.rpgBindUV1BufferOfs(VertBuff, noesis.RPGEODATA_HALFFLOAT, fvfInto[i][4], (fvfInto[i][4] - 12))
```

(You're required to replace some weird #QNAN0 strings (not a number) in the exported obj file by 0, though. Didn't dig deeper into this, but for a1020_6.gmd, SM 41, vertex count: 1865 there's about 4062 of those QNANs, two of them per vt line, for g 41 166x2.)

It's just a case of scaling them down and adding them on top.I realized that there's no second uv by myself a few days ago.

I meant there is no UV mapping in the models extracted using the old script, rather than that there is no UV mapping in the original .gmd model files themselves. Sorry if I was a bit confusing there. That looks like it could be useful so I might give that a try. 

Well what I meant was that you had 3 identical sets of geometry, so 3 sets of vertices and polys, but they all get imported onto a single mesh object. So I'm really not sure if there is a quick way to remove the redundant geometry or anything.

So now there is a bit of another problem. Basically, some of the characters have extra pieces of clothing not rigged to the original skeleton, and these are stored in these with the .cth extension so you can't extract them using the .gmd export script.

This is a bit of a bump, well, one hell of a bump actually, but its the same script and game series so it'd be silly to make a new

But the noesis script doesn't appear to work with gmd files from Yakuza 0 on PS4.

Here are a few Yakuza 0 files

[https://mega.nz/#F!cs9TUIbJ!VLacZDZYCpEoS_p4uUldVQ](https://mega.nz/#F!cs9TUIbJ!VLacZDZYCpEoS_p4uUldVQ)

A few open perfectly in this folder, whilst others even won't open at all, or they have connected vertices to other meshes (or to themselves).

The previous Yakuza game files also had this issue where some files worked, others 70% and others not at all.

These are all environment meshes however.

Is it possible for anyone to update this script, with a new Yakuza game out, I thought interest may return.

But the noesis script doesn't work.

these are some samples

Thank your for any help.

If any other samples are needed I also have the files on hand to provide, such as weapons or environments, which the previous script didn't work with.

I wouldn't know why anyone should care for a 6 years old script (gmd.py). I just mad a small adaption for non-character meshes 2 years ago but you're better off to try the above mentioned tool or use hex2obj.
see here: [viewtopic.php?f=16&t=17863&p=139246&hil ... ed#p139246](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=17863&p=139246&hilit=+confused#p139246)

(I'd also suggest to delete your post copy there because that thread is not Noesis related.)

Hey,I'm a huge fan of Ryu Ga Gotoku/ Yakuza series  I used to play them since Yakuza PS2 and and then Yakuza Dead Souls. But I ain't use ps3 or ps4 anymore...But I did watch Yakuza 5, Yakuza 6, Yakuza Kiwami and Yakuza Kiwami on Youtube even coming soon for Yakuza 3 remaster.  I'm more hobbyist artist in Deviantart You can see any yakuza artworks of mine since the model user called eddie ported all Yakuza models before his account is deactivated and very busy for long time. https://www.deviantart.com/hatredboy/favourites/  Oher user reported all models for reupload like this: https://www.deviantart.com/xnalara-cust ... 470/Yakuza

For xnalara/xps program:  http://www.tombraiderforums.com/forumdisplay.php?f=52 or http://www.xnalara.org/index.php?sid=c8 ... 2742db25cb or https://www.deviantart.com/xnalaraitalia or https://www.deviantart.com/xnalara-customized/ That,if you all are familar with these... This is where I am more popular using that program everyday for images and artworks.

Also,I'm a wiki user of Yakuza Wiki: https://yakuza.wikia.com/wiki/Yakuza_Wiki

Anyway...I've seen all your replies in pages....So here I was wondering... How does it all go this time? I'm no extractor nor models rigger But I'm more converter and exporter user once original user's mode is rigged with bones and textures fully...Did you rig any model or complete all models of Yakuza 6, Yakuza Kiwami 2? What about items and weapons? Environments? Props? Vehicles? I want to download some so I can do in xps for any artwork as possible.

Let me know if you have seen my reply and please reply back with anything! Sorry for red font though!
