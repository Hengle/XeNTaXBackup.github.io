Changed the thread name to "Iron Man 2" so I'm not spamming threads, I hope that works. Also uploaded the "Silver Centurion" model as a pkg in OP. Thanks for the suggestion.

I see.... and by any chance do you know of someone who is able to decompress the pkg files used for that game?

Really? With the extension name PKG I'd imagine it was a package file, like it is for Mac and Linux. Is there any way to view the files?

Oh I know, I was referring to the fact that on those platforms, I read that PKG files are kinda like what ZIP files are on Windows- unrelated, I was thinking maybe PKG was something similar but I know now that it's not.
But I guess that means I'm screwed. I've been searching the site and it looks like everyone else who's come across these PKG files never gets any usable models from them. =/

Ah, I see. Those actually look really good. Was it hard to make a converter? I'm very new to coding in general, I only know some basic python. Do you think it would be too hard for me to make something like this? I took a look at the definitive guide to exploring file formats, but I don't really see anything I could either understand or put into use with my current resources.
