- Post Title: Alicia Online (Repacking .pak, need help)

Here's the game in question: [Alicia Online](https://aliciagame.com/)

From my understanding, the game was developed using [Renderware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RenderWare). The game's developer was [Ntreev Soft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ntreev_Soft), the same developer of the more popular game, [PangYa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ntreev_Soft).

Unpacking the game's res.pak is easy enough, as there is an unpacker that can be found [here](http://hsreina.shadosoft-tm.com/display/cat/5). However, repacking the game's res.pak after making modifications proves to be more difficult. The launcher gets stuck on loading and unfortunately will not proceed. Could someone please help me out with fixing this problem and repacking the game's res.pak into a functional, readable format?

Thanks so much to anyone that can offer their assistance.
