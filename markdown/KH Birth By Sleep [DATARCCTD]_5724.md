- Post Title: KH: Birth By Sleep [DAT/ARC/CTD]

Hi.

I'm working on Birth By Sleep file formats in these days: DAT (the main archives), ARC (some sub-archives that contain textures and 3D models or some data) and CTD (that store some texts and subtitles).

The ARC format it's easy and I've already created an packer/unpacker.
The CTD format it's a bit hard to understand, but I've some ideas to know how it work.
The DAT files are the most important archives of the entire game! They contain all the data of the game and the file format it's a pain but I'm working on it!

I don't know if I've the free permissions to post on "Tools & Programs" or to post on blog on my first post and I've decided to write here.
If anyone is interested I can share some informations about these files

I'm interested in ALL the Birth by Sleep files; the Lub gamescripts, the CTD Shift-JS text, the PMO models, the TM2 textures, the BCD maps, and especially the PAM animations. If you do have any tools and programs uniquely qualified to view or edit or convert any of these files, particularly the PAM and/or BCD files, or any useful information regarding those formats, I would be greatly appreciative if you share them with us.

Post Script: Was the PS2P Emulator for KH2:FM+ real or just something like RemoteJoy?

The ARC files contains LUBs, PMO, TM2, BCDs and PAMs, if you extract them you can also edit these files and repack them 
For the ARC files on Tales of the World I don't think that the structure is the same (if you want you can send me an PM with the extractor and with an ARC of Tales and I'll release an unpacker with the source code  ) because the developer-house is different

Falo could view at least one BCD 3D map. Do you have any idea how?

Nope, I'm not expert with 3D models. Really I'm not interested to find/view/extract 3D models (maybe one day yes), but only to unpack/repack files data that allow the editing of the game

How do you unpack a lub file?
