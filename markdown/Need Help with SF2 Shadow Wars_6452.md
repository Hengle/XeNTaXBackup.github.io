- Post Title: Need Help with SF2 Shadow Wars

Hello all.

Can Someone take a look at this file from Spellforce  Shadow Wars, it is the Elven female Nightsong.

[http://www.filesonic.com/file/735788611/Special_Elf.rar](http://www.filesonic.com/file/735788611/Special_Elf.rar)
The formats are:

.ams as an animation library
.dds for the textures
.drs for the models
.ska for the animations

It would be great to be able to load her and other models up in a 3D app.

Thanks for any Attempts
