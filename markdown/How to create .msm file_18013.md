Hey, There is a game called "Just Dance" and it's a dance game. There is a file extension called ".msm" which is for moves. Does anyone knows how to create .msm files? 


MSM: Movement File (In Just Dance, when you're doing dancer's moves, it gives feedback right? MSM's are for the moves that giving you feedbacks)

To create a merge module in MSI Factory, you should create a new project (File > New) and then choose "Merge Module Project" from the Start a New Project dialog. If this dialog does not appear then select Edit > Preferences from the menu and ensure that the Show New Project dialog option is turned on in the Startup section of the Project tab.

If you have the Show project wizard checkbox turned on you will be able to specify some options for your merge module using the project wizard. Otherwise you will see an empty merge module project.
