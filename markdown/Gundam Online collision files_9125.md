- Post Title: Gundam Online collision files

Hello, im wondering if this file type is a 3d model. Im almost 100% sure that it is and I base this off of of the same way GTA handles its collisions. GTA has round surfaces and planes to detect where it collides, this is a simpler way to detect collisions without causing unforeseen glitches, unfortunately the current game we play has bad collision detection and causes ALLOT of glitches and that is because collision mesh wasn't designed the right way. Here is an example of what im talking about 

Fortunately I have allot of experience in optimizing and fixing allot of collision files being a modder of the GTA scene and I/we want to bring that experience to Gundam Online. I had found also that we could also get collision files to cull onscreen so that would also open possibilities for us to mod the game with new buildings vehicles and such which would make us very happy at UCGOserver.com 

Here are a few samples, I have had the pleasure to discuss this with DIMPS officials about this file type and couldn't give me any leads about it other then the fact that it was developed with an in house tool that has been abandoned.

These files aren't copywrited but since the last time I posted here and the new rules in effect, im not risking my membership here so if you email me at Troopermaniac  @gmail.com ill be happy to send some samples to anyone interested


A bit off topic but appreciate any help I could get and this community has been extremely helpful to me so far. Because of that I had released mods for the game that really helped out the English community and id like to let the people here know I wouldn't have done it without your help.

lol are all those big circles also part of the collision detection? You can pretty much hit something even if you completely miss it LOL

usually the mesh is shown so that you could get as close as possible but yeah, that's how they do it and if not done properly you'll probably be sitting there like WTF I didn't even hit it.
