- Post Title: [Android] PVZ Heroes texture unpacking

I cannot find out how to extract these textures I've been trying for the past 3 months without any luck so that's why i can here to see if i can find help. 
This game runs on unity from what i can tell but the assets are everywhere on this game. It also downloads the game when you install the apk so the textures may have been downloaded through that way but i could never find them not even when i looked inside them it just had unity assets or just nothing at all so they're in a different path. and when i do they're in the format of __data and __info. There's also the AssetPathsManifest but i could never figure it out besides opening it in notepad++ so maybe it could become of use.
So the apk is here if you want to try and figure it out because i tried everything that i know.
