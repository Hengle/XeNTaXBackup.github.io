I downloaded the demo for this and noticed it has complete DDS files including the DDS header in the library files. The same as Catwoman PCS files, Serene aquarium, and Lego Star Wars. If you want to extract the textures I do have a Perl script wrote.
 My Perl is just good enough to get me by. My biggest problem is not understanding how to locate the start of the graphic by the index listing in the library. In a lot of the library files I see the name of the texture with what appears to be the offset of the graphic in the library but I just can't seem to understand how to interpret the address.
 What I end up doing is a search for a specific string and ripping the texture from there. Because of this I usually end up saving the filename by the offset and not the graphic name.
 I am going to keep pounding the Catwoman specs posted elsewhere on this site into my brain and hopefully something will turn on a light.
