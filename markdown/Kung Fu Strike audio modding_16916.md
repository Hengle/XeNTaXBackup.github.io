- Post Title: Kung Fu Strike audio modding

I'm working on a total conversion. 
Does anyone here on the forums know how can I extract and reintroduce audio files from the MusicWaveBank.xwb audio container?
Is there maybe a QuickBMS script available?
Many thanks.

I was able to extract the sound files with xactxtract.exe, modified the wav files to my liking, but now I have to re-introduce them into the xwb file... I tried a few QuickBMS scripts I found for xwb files from other games but none worked...



I'll keep searching the Internet and if I find something, I'll post the link here, just in case anyone else needs it too...

If anyone here would be willing to share (or make) a QuickBMS script for the xwb files from the Kung Fu Strike game, I would be immensely grateful...

I've uploaded some sample xwb files here: [https://www.mediafire.com/file/1nhnjsvid1u350v/xwbs.7z](https://www.mediafire.com/file/1nhnjsvid1u350v/xwbs.7z)

Here's hoping...

Here are the scripts that didn't work, in case they are of use...

And here is the batch command file to reÃ­ntroduce the modded audio. Maybe there's something wrong here, and not in the scripts...

Apparently "Kung Fu Strike" isn't a very popular game (for modding, at least)...

For what platform are you trying to modify the game ???
