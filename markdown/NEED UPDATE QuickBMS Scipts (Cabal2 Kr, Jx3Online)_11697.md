Dear people!

At this time this 2 QuickBMS Scripts are outofdate and with that the Xentax community can not use it!

Cabal2 Korea Client (newest Client)     QuickBmS script dont work

Jx3Online  (newest Client) QuickBmS script dont work

Has anybody an actual QuickBMS Script to unpack this actual Clients ?

For Jx3Online i have this more informations, look at screen!

I think its time for this big community to check the QuickBMS Scripts for actual games for mass update that all QuickBMS scripts run without Problems.

Nice greetings

troll
