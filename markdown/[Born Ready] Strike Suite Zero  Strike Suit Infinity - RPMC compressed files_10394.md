Could anyone update this tool for the newer compression of SSZ and SSI?
I've attached a lua file from each game...

I may be mistaken about the lua files being compressed... They might simply be compiled. I'll open another thread for that in the apropiate section.

It was not a matter of compiled but compressed files.
The Strike Suit Zero lua files can be decompressed with this QuickBMS script.
For the newer Strike Suit Infinity game a working script still has to be made...

The only files that have no tool yet to be decompressed are the level files (lvl) and the two language files (log and lng)...
