Sorry. So I'm looking for an extractor for this game's music. I looked all over the Internet and couldn't find one. I of course tried the usual game music extractors like Game Audio Player, but none of them could handle Nomad Soul's .adp format.
I hope someone will look into it.

Thanks.

Hello.

I realise this is late, but after an attempt made myself I've discovered, by importing an .ADP file, raw, into Audacity, encoded as VOX ADPCM, monaural, little-endian, at a sample rate of 41,000Hz, you can uncover some audible rendition that resembles the original soundtrack audio to a veritable degree of satisfaction.

I would attach an .MP3 of what I've managed to extract but it seems that's not possible here.

----- EDIT -----

Pardon me, I have discovered it's possible to add files. Attached therefore is an audio-clip of a sample I've extracted successfully using the above method.

Fun note - Omikron the Nomad Soul is one of my nostalgic obsessions. It was released when I was only 8 months old. Seems you posted this question when I was four years of age. I pity you for being held in suspense for all of this time.

-----

Hope that was helpful.

Here's another one (one of the last files strangely) 158.ADP, appears to be the soundtrack played in the 'peep show':

(One of the better quality ones I've extracted, if you're skeptical of my earlier post).

Strangely, 157.ADP and 158.ADP are exactly the same size, and, seem to match exactly too.

The compilers of Omikron - The Nomad Soul clearly rushed their make if they missed that they had obvious duplicates. Although, let's be honest, the gameplay reveals how rushed the game was to its finish, exacerbated further by the fact that in all the game's size totalled to a wopping and unacceptable 1.5GiB if a full installation was chosen, or, close to 0.5GiB if minimal was selected. I imagine back in 1999 hard drive capacities didn't really exceed 10GiB.

A game otherwise full of great potential, and was my favourite for a long time, was turned to a heap of waste by the notorious and omnipresent exertion of pressure by Eidos on its acquired video game groups to complete their games within impossible deadlines. It's a shame. I've kept a keen eye upon on any news of coming remastering attempts to revive TNS. I'd pay good money to purchase a copy if ever it did happen.

Hey guys,

I revive this post very quickly in case it could help someone researching this in an hypothetic future.

So a while back I played with omikron's files to see what I could get, mainly for nostalgia sake I suppose. I was mainly interested in characters and meshes stored in 3DO files. The trick is that 3DO is a generic mesh format that store more or less data if its a character, an object or scene (containing cameras, lights, and other meshes).

The python script I came up with worked well for objects (In my french copy of the game data named "MISCS" and "OBJETS"), failed for scene ("DECORS") and kind of works for characters ("PERSOS"), meaning their triangle list are supposedly compressed or indexed in a weird way that scramble the result a bit (I could not find how though).

Finally I didn't find textures infos, supposedly held in the 3DT files.

In any case here the script I came up with, the offsets infos can help anyone interested in researching this a bit more.

Cheers

I am interested into extracting somehow the voice of David Bowie

Can someone help on where i would find those files within the game? 
I can not seem to find this by the method of ULOKZ

Thanks so much!
