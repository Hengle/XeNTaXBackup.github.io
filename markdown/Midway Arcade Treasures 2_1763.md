I'm a bit perplexed with this one, as it seems all of the file extensions are none I've seen listed as of yet. They are: .elf, .bik, .irx, and .sr (and single .ico file). Really, all I'm trying to do is extract the Mortal Kombat SFX (e.g. screams, voices, and so on). I can post some sample files if need be. If you guys specify which you'd like to have a look at exactly, I'll only upload files pertinent to those extensions.

P.S. All the .ELF files are in the root directory ("MAT2"). From there, it splits off into 4 folders: "CLASSIC" (which contains the .SR files); "ICONS" (which contains the lone .ICO file); "MODULES" (which contains the .IRX files); and, last but not least, "VIDEOS" (which contains the .BIK files). The VIDEOS folder subsequently branches into 4 more subdirectories; BONUS, OTHER, PREV, and TRANS â€” all of which contain .BIK files. Presumably, venturing an educated guess, the BIK files are where the sounds I'm looking for are located. But, I'll leave the expert analysis for the experts here who know (since I don't ).

Hope this info helps some in advance.

Well, if the SFX file is the one you want, why not upload a sample of that?

Also, if you haven't already, read the Game Request rules. Thx!

I'm relatively new to all of this, hence I'm not quite sure which that would be, what file extension it would have, or what folder it would be under.

I suppose I can compress and upload the entire 2gb game to yousendit, though.

Well, what are rather big files? .SR ? Might be Sound Resources? Archives are usually big files.

Ordinary BIK-files are you able to play/edit (?) with [RADTools](http://www.radgametools.com/).

PXR, thanks for the heads-up about RADTools and the link. After examining those BIKs, it's apparent those aren't the files containing the sounds. It looks like, given the size, they're -- as originally suspected by Mr.Mouse -- in the files with the SR extension. I've uploaded the Mortal Kombat related SR files; direct d/ls below. Let me know what you find out.

Okay, I have figured it out. Just need to write you a plugin. Remind me if I take too long ('cause work and other requests are waiting in line  )
