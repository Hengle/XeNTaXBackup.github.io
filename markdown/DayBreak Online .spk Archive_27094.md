- Post Title: DayBreak Online .spk Archive

Greetings XenTax members,

I just felt in love with this game and decided to take a discovery look on it is files, however the game made with game engine called "Saturn Engine" and mostly using Lua Scripting to deal with resources as I discovered. I saw an old topic but did not help me that much. [viewtopic.php?p=78314#p78314](https://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?p=78314#p78314) Also, I discovered that some files have only .spk extension, but when you open with hex editor you can see it is real extension either PNG or BMP .. and so on. But in some files are either encrypted or compressed, and did not have much knowledge in that so I am asking for some help with that.

You might check the old topic has some sample of the file type and the client of the game provided so you can take a look on how it deals with the .spk file.

I appreciate any help in advance.
