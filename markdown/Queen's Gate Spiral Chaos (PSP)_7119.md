- Post Title: Queen's Gate: Spiral Chaos (PSP)

The data appears to be stored in a file called "graphics.bin" (which I've uploaded [here](http://www.mediafire.com/?d820lrbgvolsx6d)) but opening it in a hex editor yields gibberish, which means it's waaaaaaaay above my head (and probably encrypted or whatever). I'd love some help with this.

Apologies for the sparse post, but tbh I've literally no idea how to decrypt/whatever this myself, so might as well ask.

Again, the apparent archive in question is uploaded at [http://www.mediafire.com/?d820lrbgvolsx6d](http://www.mediafire.com/?d820lrbgvolsx6d).
