- Post Title: Zero from Onimusha Blade Warriors.

Okay. I have the files from Zero's folder in the ISO. Namely the 3 .MDL files the game uses.

Note, these are PS2 MDLs. What I'm trying to do is convert them to OBJ, 3DS, or whatever format that 3D Studio Max uses.

The file comes with the following as well: a Binary (.bin), two Datas (.dat and .MXT), and a graphics mapping file (.MPK) along with the .MDL geometry files.

If you're wondering why I am doing this: I am trying to prepare the model for use in Super Smash Brothers Brawl. Problem is: A: 3DSMAX on it's own can't import the .MDLs. B : Noesis can't open them, and C: Trying to rip the model from the game via 3DviaPrntScrn with ZeroGS gets absolutely nothing. No vertices, no faces, no UVs, nothing.

Is there anyone here who knows of a way to make it so I can import this into 3DSMAX?

I'll include a DL for the .rar containing the 3 .MDLs below if anyone wants to take a crack at them, or can tell me what I need to do.
