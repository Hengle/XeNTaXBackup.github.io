- Post Title: Mind Jack (PS3/360)

Mind jack uses the exact same format as no more heroes.
The only models we can import tho are the ones in the test folder.
the other models are compressed with an unknown compression.

If it's like No More Heroes you can get the textures from the PS3 version I believe.
