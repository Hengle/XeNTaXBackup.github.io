- Post Title: TMNT: Turtles in Time Reshelled   UBISOFT ODD BIN FILES?

When extracting the BF file that this games data was in, I was met with a load of bin files with very odd contents. Here is a sample of one of the bin files

If anyone could figure out how to extract these, it'd be greatly appreciated.
