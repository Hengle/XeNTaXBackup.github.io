Anyone available to help me? the game's developer encrypted the files to not be edited, can anyone with experience in this area help me? I need to know how to decrypt this file (.MW2), there are old topics on this subject, but I think there is no solution, I wanted a more complete explanation nowadays

If you are talking about zipcrypto, it is combined with CRC. There were no detailed instructions at all, so I took a chance and tried different things, but that's how I was able to unzip it.
The key is different for each file, but it is the CRC that is used, so if you have the knowledge, you can even make a decompression script.
