- Post Title: Looking for ModelViewerWXD3D9 Version 0.4

Does anyone still have the 0.4 version? Perhaps post it on mediafire and email me at [dragicorn@hotmail.com](mailto:dragicorn@hotmail.com), to not violate the rules. Thank you. I'm looking for the latest version WITH kingdom hearts 1 animation and model support, not just kingdom hearts 2 support. I don't wish to use the models, just view them. That's okay in that case, right? I already have them all extracted anyway.

The post on this forum Yaz0r made to his 0.4 version was deleted by the forum due to rules violation. I have the file on one of my hard drives, but it would be a pain to get it out. It doesn't really do much; it's just a less-developed [crappier] version of 0.5, and it can't load KH1 files, only KH2. Still, if you want it, I might be able to dig it up, but when I have time.
