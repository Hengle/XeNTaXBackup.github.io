- Post Title: Can't decompile actionscript for this SWF File

I got a request to look at a SWF file. Here it is

[http://www.mediafire.com/download/g7gax ... client.zip](http://www.mediafire.com/download/g7gaxr8cxq7voqi/client.zip)

I use SoThink SWF Decompiler for most of my decompiling needs and it's been pretty good.
However, for this particular file, it's unable to decompile the scripts properly. In fact, it looks like it's struggling just to read the script directory since it messes up a lot of the names.

Anyone familiar with SWF might know what's happening?
I just want to look at the action script files.

Hi Finale00
I took a rapid look, the actionscript is in version 3 and i think Sothink is not capable to read AS3

Just a heads up regarding decompilers, the best one right now by far is JPEXS free one. because it's open-source it's updated extremely frequently. Their website is [http://www.free-decompiler.com/](http://www.free-decompiler.com/) which seems super sketchy at first, but when i was in a conversation with some of the core contributors, they said it was available so they didn't think twice before getting it.
