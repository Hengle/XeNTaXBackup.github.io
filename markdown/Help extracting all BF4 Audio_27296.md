- Post Title: Help extracting all BF4 Audio

Hi all,  I've been searching for a day now before I posted this but I'm struggling with getting all of the audio from the game such as :

Voiceovers,  Music,  Weapon sounds,  Explosion SFX,  Vehicle sounds and so on..

I've been using the scripts here > [https://github.com/NicknineTheEagle/Frostbite-Scripts](https://github.com/NicknineTheEagle/Frostbite-Scripts)

I have half the battle won however,  I managed to get the gamefiles dumped but I cannot seem to get the audio to extract using ebxtoasset

It starts and it hangs on 
"= RESTART: J:\Dumped Games\BF4\ebxtoasset.py
Loading GUID table...
Loading RES table..."

Anyone knowledgable enough to show me where I'm going wrong?

:edit:
I've managed to get that last part working I guess but now I'm left with .sps files which idk how to get into the proper waveform format.

Any help?
