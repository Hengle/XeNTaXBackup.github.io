- Post Title: help extracting Tekken data to create a cool video.

I saw this Street Fighter Motion Video [http://vimeo.com/66115264](http://vimeo.com/66115264) and why not do this for Tekken.

So! I want to have a go at doing better!

I'm asking for character models with texture and their fight animation. Something nice across the screen like the hwoarang combo. and a few other characters.

Anyone help me get this data?
