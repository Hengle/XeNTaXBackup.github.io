- Post Title: Smooth Model Problem. Help Please!

I have models that I extract from an emulator JPCSP, I want to make a project in GTA SA rigging this skins for use, but I'm having problems. I export the OBJ scene from the emulator and import it into 3ds max and delete the objects until I get what I need, the problem is that when I apply the smooth, it doesn't get completely smooth. What to do? For your to know what I'm talking about, see the picture.   



Photo 1 is the original OBJ model

Photo 2 i applied smooth in OBJ model, this is not good for me but the edge faces appear in the model 

Photo 3 is another model from fixe75 pack ripped models and converted to 3DS, this is the result i want obtain, a correct smooth.

This game is THE Warriors, for psp and ps2.I found here on the forum a old topic about the game and found models of this game exported from jpcsp, I wonder how fixer75 managed to apply the smooth correctly. The photo 3 is a model from fixer75 pack of ripped models from the warrios.

This is the link of old topic:
