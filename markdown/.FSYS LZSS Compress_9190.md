- Post Title: .FSYS LZSS Compress

Hi, I'm new. I need a little help. I'm trying to write a program that will open all formats of .FSYS files. (Found in PBR, PC, and XD)
They are LZSS compressed, and I'm having TONS of trouble looking for similarities while it's compressed. I'm a HUGE n00b, so you can treat me like one...

I'm a noob so I have no idea what PBR, PC, and XD mean.

Is this for the wii or some nintendo platform?
