I don't really understand the android part or what is your talking about but, guess what, you can do it yourself.
Grab the Frosty Tools Suite from here: [http://frostytoolsuite.com/](http://frostytoolsuite.com/)
Then import the PC game to load it in its entirety and navigate to your desired sound fx and export what ever is your looking for.

have fun
