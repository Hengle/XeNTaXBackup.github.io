- Post Title: [HELP] How to unpack .pak from Mo Siang Online

Hi, can anyone share some unpacker for Prius Online .dat and Mo Siang .pak?

I have search for unpacker for this game, I found one for prius online but it needs higher level account from other forum.

Maybe, someone have a bmsript to unpack .dat [Prius Online gpotato] and .pak [Mo Siang]

I've tried most script in bms that works for .pak but no luck.

Here is a sample file from Mo Siang:

I cannot provide a sample for .dat of Prius Online, its 2.8gb.

Thanks.

i guess you need to make ten "useful" posts in order to download anything there
strange forum rules and it looks dead anyway

you could use a filecutter script to split a smaller sample of the archive for analysis

aluigi could probably make a script within 24 hours and make it public too

Yes, they have that kind of rules to make some "useful" post in order to gain access and can download the tools.
