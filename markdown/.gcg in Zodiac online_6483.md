the problem is that the script has not been made for that file.
the script unpacks the files with a '_' at the end of their extension while you have a gcg file there (and no I don't know what is that file)

maybe it's not a classical archive (no file information table or maybe obfuscated).
if you open it with notepad++ you can see it's 99% text
