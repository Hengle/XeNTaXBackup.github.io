Hi guys, I need help with extracting some bitmaps from the "Windows 3D pinball" .DAT files.
The files are PINBALL.DAT and FONT.DAT, the former contains the graphics and the latter contains
the bitmap font. I am aiming to be able to extract and reinsert these graphics into their respective files.

Samples:
