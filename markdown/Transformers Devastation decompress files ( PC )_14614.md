- Post Title: Transformers Devastation decompress files ( PC )

Greetings to all,

Good morning, I wanted to ask a question, I also want to say I am new to the forum and I do not know if successful with the section where I can ask how to extract data from a file.

The point is I'm trying to make mods for Transformers: Devastation.

The fact is that after having unzipped the file ".cpk" with Noesis  or CriPakTools-master and extracted the contents of the corresponding .dat file with dattool.

The question is this, now I need to extract the contents of .wmb file to edit the .dae with Blender file and 3Dmax or other texture files.

I've seen online that there are people using Noesis to extract the contents of .wmb file, but even that I copy plugins Metal Gear Rising Revengeance or The Legend of Korra PC Noesis Plugin as its file structure is similar to the folder / plugins /, I still can not detect .wmb files.

Someone can tell me how to extract the contents of the files .wmb?
