- Post Title: Iron Man 1: The Game .pkg unpacking

hi people! i've been using the iron man 2 extraction tools and it works amazing. but i was wondering if i could extract the iron man 1 game. but after testing it, with the iron man 2 script on a pkg file of im1. it fails, the problem probably lies in the hex codes and i was wondering if anyone could help me edit the script to work with iron man 1 pkg files 


Here is a sample [https://www.mediafire.com/file/5840mutv ... r.pkg/file](https://www.mediafire.com/file/5840mutvlgxcx8j/DVD_IronMonger.pkg/file)
