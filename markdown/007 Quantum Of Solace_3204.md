What you found out was not much. The interesting data appears after the decompression of the ZLIB-data at offset 1Ch of each ".ff"-file.
I'm on it.
But I could need some help in reversing.

Sorry to dig this back out of the ground, but with Spectre coming up, I've been on a bit of a Bond fling and given this hadn't really gone anywhere I figured I'd see if anyone had tried since, or whether someone might be able to help me with this conundrum...

I recently tried Ninja Ripping QoS, and the models all come out as I screengrabbed them... not T-Posed! Has anyone else ever come across this with Ninja Ripper? Every other game I've ripped from it's taken the game models out in their default poses and often jumbles up scenery because of how it's obviously put together, but I got my hands on a copy of Quantum of Solace last night hoping to pull Mads and Olga out, but when I go to import the meshes into 3DSMax, it basically compiles the whole level exactly as I captured it, characters in motion and everything. Has anyone ever experienced this or know how I might be able to get around it? I was half hoping someone might've pulled some sort of sneaky programming manoeuvre and managed to come up with an extractor given it's a slightly modified IW Engine, similar to the IW CoD games...

Any help or suggestions would be appreciated. On the plus side, I do have a surprisingly good rip of Mads'/Le Chiffre's head if anyone's up for rigging!

I know this is not the help you're looking for but a small tip I have, If you haven't done already, is to complete the game and go to the menu for extras and find the static models in the trophy rooms.

It's been awhile since I've tried it, so I don't remember the names exactly, but I think this is the best place to take captures IMO.

also, I too would be very interested in the T-Posed models if possible.

btw, the I think PS2 version has variations of the Female models not in the PC version but I could be wrong.
