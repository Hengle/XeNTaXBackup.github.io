- Post Title: Project Blackout *.i3s / *.I3CHR file format.

Hello I wonder if anyone of you have looked in to [Project Blackout (aka Point Blank)](http://us.fps-pb.com/). The game is free to play, and it has some really nice models in it. I have made a little research on it and here's all i have managed to find till now:

The game is on iCube engine 

Most of the files (assets) are packed in *.i3Pack files. (I have unpacker, i'll upload [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/7vzi0f7abkch6tb/i3%20Pack%20Tools.7z))

The models are in *.I3CHR or *i3s files. 

The textures are in *.isi files. (I have converter - *.i3i to *.dds, i'll upload [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/1jj6d6j71mpir9m/I3I%20Tools.7z))

My problem however (like always) are the models. Can someone look on them? Here are some samples of the *.i3s and *.I3CHR files. 

I can upload original textures (in *.i3i) and original pack files (*.i3Pack) if anyone is interested in the compression (I don't think it's necessary)

And here are [the samples.](https://www.dropbox.com/s/bt9jixytx62p7va/PB%20Samples.7z)

Thank you for your time. Any help would be really appreciated.
