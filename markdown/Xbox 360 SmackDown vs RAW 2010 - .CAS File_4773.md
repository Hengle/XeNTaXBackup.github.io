Hey guys,

since the 360 supports USB Devices now, I tried getting the files for Created Superstars on my Computer.
The reason was, the problem that you cant edit user created content that you downloaded.
So now I was looking for a way to make the .CAS File of a downloaded Wrestler act like it was a selfcreated .CAS File so you can edit it.

Unfortunately I am not experienced in this stuff so I'm asking for your help.
I tried playing around with the files in a Hex Editor but with no sucess except for corrupted savefiles 


Hope you guys give it a try and have more luck/skill then I have

I can tell you exactly why you can't edit them.  The file has DOWNLOADED in the name used by the 360 for display in the dashboard, and also in the actual gave save, DOWNLOADED is also added to the name.  You have to change the name in both the .CAS file and also in the actual game save, along with the correct checksums and resigning the files both properly.  Good luck, you'll need it, but I would just accept the fact you can't edit them now, to save you the heartache.
