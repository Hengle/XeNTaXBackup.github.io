Hello everyone! I need help with Green Lantern .lvl_760 containers, I would like to write script for importing models from that game. I think it's fully possible. I managed to achieve some success, but it would be so much easier to figure it out if files will be extracted from .lvl_760. Heres sample files [http://www.mediafire.com/?walv3awbbm6l43q](http://www.mediafire.com/?walv3awbbm6l43q) Thanks in advance

Have some progress with models from Green Lantern game, it would be perfect if texture could be extracted too. I think they have .tfo extension.
