- Post Title: Can't download the LuckySoft/Stella Games Utilities software.

Apologies if this is the wrong board, this is the first time i've ever used this forum. However, I was attempting to decrypt files for the game "Mystery of Mortlake Mansion" and the only tool I could find for it was the LuckySoft/Stella Games Utilities, created by GMMan, however, all the download links seem to be dead, and I was wondering if there's someway to either download the software or decrypt the games files without the software.

The game i'm trying to decrypt is Mystery of Mortlake Mansion, a 2011 casual point and click game which was created by Stella Games. The company seems to have shutdown long ago, and the game is relatively unknown so there's not much info about it online.

Thanks in advance. (Also here's the link to the software I was trying to download, in case ya need it: [viewtopic.php?t=7838](https://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?t=7838))
