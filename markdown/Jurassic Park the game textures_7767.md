- Post Title: Jurassic Park the game textures

Hi there!

Me and another guy are translating Jurassic Park the game in Italian.

With subtitles it's ok, but what about the localization in textures?

I extracted them with ttarchext, they're in dds.
The original files d3dtx and extracted dds have the same size; some with dxt1 others with dxt5 compression (I seen it with notepad)

For a try, I edited the sign near the triceratops fence; saved it in another format with photoshop (I have also its dds plugin but I don't know how to configure it right), then riconverted with ddsconverter with "dxt1a" compression, the only one right I think (the original dds of this texture is dxt1):

These are the settings I used:

but it risult more "compressed", i.e.: original file (d3dtx & dds)= 699 Kb ; edited dds= 524 Kb...

However, using ttg tools to riconvert it in d3dtx, it returns with the right size...

Now, the base ttarch file for texture is like 500 Mb and contains thousands of files, so I have to extract all the file, replace the one interested, and rebuild...right?

So I thought to replace the ttarch localized in french, which is more light and contain only localized textures.

Then changed the language to french, to see if works, and indeed it did! 

but in game it appears like this:

Here is the files in question (originals and edited):

What's wrong? Someone can help with it?

Thanks for replying

However nothing changed, maybe they have a different dxt1 compression? :S

So I have to edit manually each texture with an hex editor?

I don't know how to find the header 

Sadly I don't understand very much with this kind of stuff; I put so much effort on translating textures that I really want to solve this catch!

Who said, you have to use hex editor?!

Did you used the Compressonator? There must be a MipMap value. Try to change it, auntil you DDS si so big, as the original was.

I don't know how to use it 

Anyway chrrox posted the right dds with mipmap, it has the same size as original 

But I put it in game and nothing changed :\, appears "corrupted" as before

This is why I was asking if I have to edit manually

I had luck with Nvidia's Photoshop plugin at last...

Just set:
"DXT1         ARGB   4 bpp | 1 bit alpha" ; "Generate MIP Maps" and "2D Texture"

A strange thing is that the hue of the converted image tends to green, but otherwise, everything's fine
