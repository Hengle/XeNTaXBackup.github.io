- Post Title: Prototype 2 - 3p3d audio files

Hello guys, 

I would need some help to extract the audio files from this game. So far, I have managed to extract the files from the rcf. extension, but I am now stuck with the p3d extension, that I don't know how to deal with. This format is normally used for models, textures, but they somehow managed to put all the audio files in this type of file. Could some of you help me extracting the audio files in a more readable format. I am totally noob with quickbms and scripts, and so on, so please be very explicit; Thank you in advance. I can provide you with sample files in PM.
