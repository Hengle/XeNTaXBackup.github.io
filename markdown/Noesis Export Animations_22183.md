- Post Title: Noesis: Export Animations

Hey, I'm trying to export a model to Valve SMD format. It's working but only the first animation in the list is being exported, the others are not. Am i doing something wrong or is this a bug?

Sample model: [https://www.mediafire.com/file/enxfdtzs ... 7.mdl/file](https://www.mediafire.com/file/enxfdtzsfu3ssp5/v_ak47.mdl/file)

did you use " export from preview" or "export" function? 
the first one should export only the animation you played in the preview. dunno if the second option could export the whole  animation archive , maybe yes and you have to split manually the archive.
Which game are you trying to export?

Tried the two options, both are only exporting the first animation.
I'm exporting to MilkShape 3D to later use in Counter-Strike
