- Post Title: Warframe Online .png textures

Hi everyone, I'm trying to open/convert textures from game Warframe [https://warframe.com](https://warframe.com)
Textures have .png extention, but of course they aren't .png files. I want to write a model-import script, but if there's no option to get textures it's pointless. If anyone could help it will be awesome, any help or advice will be highly appreciated.
Some samples attached

I want to bump this thread, because my first sample textures were bad. Sorry about that, dont know why they were extracted like that. Here's good sample textures [https://www.mediafire.com/?m6bu7doz5gho3mh](https://www.mediafire.com/?m6bu7doz5gho3mh)

If you add a normal DDS header on the images you will see the image go in and out like only half is there. Maybe there is some more compression on the textures. But I am also not the best on image formats so I am not sure.

I'm looking at a texture about which the H-cache PNG file says max. res. = 2048 pixels.
Assuming this indicates a square size this would result in a DXT1 file of 2,796,344 bytes (with full MipMaps).
A DDS header size is 128 bytes, and adding the size of the B-cache PNG file, plus the size of the F-cache PNG file, results in the same number. Still the image is mixed up: it's kind of 'interlaced', structures can be recognized but are repeated twice horizontally.

Looking at the model's UVs, it looks like indeed the image should be repeated twice (for left and right), only the image rows should be reordered. Such reordering strongly suggest a non-DXT1 encoding per MipMap, although it seems similar.
The file size of the F-cache PNG file strongly suggests 4bpp, which only leaves the options of (1) DXT1 or (2) RGB with a 16-color palette. Another option (3) might be 2048x1024 (non-square) 8bpp with full MipMaps.

Taking the last 2,097,152 bytes from an F-cache PNG file, and adding a BMP header with a 4bpp 256-color palette, results in a mixed up image: it's kind of 'interlaced', structures can be recognized, and there is no repetition.

Another example is an F-cache PNG file of 1,376,256 bytes, about which the H-cache PNG file says: "Compression=COLOR_SMOOTH_ALPHA". So I'm guessing this must be a square 1024 pixel DXT5 image, and again the file size fits the bill: 128 + 21872 + 1376256 = size of DXT5 1024 pixels square with full MipMaps. Again the image is mixed up: structures can be recognized but are repeated horizontally.

The size of B-cache PNG files suggests that they actually hold some of the smaller MipMaps.
In case of the above supposed DXT5 file, the size of the B-cache PNG file corresponds to a DXT5 image of 128 pixels square with full MipMaps. Putting a header on it produces a garbled image.

In the contents of H-cache PNG files there are indications about max. res., compression and color space.
At the end of such a file I'm typically seeing ~22 floats, quite often equal to 1 or ~0.5. Maybe these numbers indicate gamma correction / color correction per MipMap. This all suggest that the textures have been saved with a tool that offers much more control over the pixel format. Looking at a tool like PVRTexTool you can see that there are much more options for creating a MipMapped texture than the relatively simple (!) NVidia plugin for Photoshop.

Warframe uses a DLL called 'libEGL.dll', which provides support for OpenGL ES 2.0.
With PVRTexTool it's possible to encode for this pixel format.
Encoding and MipMapping with 'OpenGL ES 2.0 ETC1' results in a file size that corresponds to a Warframe texture size, only now there is an 148 bytes header.
I can add such a header to Warframe files, but now I have no program to view the result..

Anyway, maybe "Game Format Scanner" can solve this  ( [viewtopic.php?f=18&t=12224](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=18&t=12224) ).

Hello guys.

I'm currently working on the texture converter.
Actually EE's png is block based DDS with reversed stream.

My converter is almost done but still not perfect.

anyway, every non-ASCII files used by EE are headerless. (e.g. wav files are headerless xwm)
If anyone knows get proper header info like image width/height, let me know.

check the attached image for proof the converter.

APPENDIX -- my progress on the header file

My experimental converter is quite primitive and it's really complicated to use.
So here is the actual algorithm in psuedo-code.

```
  fileDestination = blah.dds.raw
  bufBlockBuffer_0 []
  bufBlockBuffer_1 []
  sizeBlock = 0x2000
  posBlock []

func init(){
  posBlock[0] = 0
  posBlock[1] = 1
  convertThread()
}

func convertThread(){
  bufBlockBuffer_0 = read(fileSource, posBlock[0], sizeBlock) ;read (char filename, int seek location, int bytes to read)
  bufBlockBuffer_1 = read(fileSource, posBlock[1]*sizeBlock, sizeBlock)
  while (bufBlockBuffer_0 == 0; bufBlockBuffer_1 == 0):
    write DWORD from bufBlockBuffer_0 to fileDestination
    write DWORD from bufBlockBuffer_1 to fileDestination
  posBlock[0] += 2
  posBlock[1] += 2
}

init()
while (until bufBlockBuffer reached to the end of file)
{
  convertThread()
}

```


Currently I'm working on a explorer for extract, convert resources. By that, I don't want to rewrite this for standalone application.

If you have any question related with this, please let me know.

That seems to work just fine (for an assumed DXT1 DDS file).
How did you find that sizeBlock = 0x2000 ?

As you know DDS format have simple format and when I just put standard DXT1 header on the file (png thing), I can recognize rough view of the image.
and I found some binary density pattern and it wasn't hard at all.

That's a nice program for detecting patterns, what is it?

> ".. get proper header info like image width/height.."
I guess there's only one way of doing this: preparing your own table of <file size>, <width>, <height>, <DDS type>, <# MIPmaps>.
So far I've only split off the largest MIPmap off of some png's (at the end of an F-cache png file). Then I ran through your reversal method,
and then I put a DXT1 header on top of it (no MIPmaps):
- 2,752,512 bytes = DXT1 2048x2048, full MIPmaps;
-   655,360 bytes = DXT1 1024x1024, full MIPmaps;
-   131,072 bytes = DXT1 512x512, only one MIPmap.

Here's a bit of eye-candy for the result:

It's called "Binglide" ([https://github.com/wapiflapi/binglide](https://github.com/wapiflapi/binglide)).

quite useful when I unpack some executable too.

Ah, great stuff here. So far I've had some success with extracting model data, however I ended up using NinjaRipper to extract the textures from memory. i know it's not the most intuitive way to do it. But it is one way.

That was, perhaps, almost a year ago. I think it's time I'd upgraded my level of interpretation.

Also, there has to be a better way of determining image width/height than just going off of file size alone.

This is what the output looks like when you view it in Microsoft's DirectX texture tool. Other programs seem to throw an exception about the file format.

Again, grayscale. And there appears to be mipmaps in the top-half of the image.

This is what I use:

```
{	
	FILE* fIn = NULL;
	FILE* fOut = NULL;
	char* pixels0;
	char* pixels1;
	char* pixOut;

	fIn = fopen( pngFileWF, "rb" );

	strcat( pngFileWF, "_reversed.png" );
	fOut = fopen( pngFileWF, "wb+" );

	fseek( fIn, 0, SEEK_END );
	int fSz = ftell( fIn );
	fseek( fIn, 0, SEEK_SET );

	pixels0 = (char*)malloc( WFBLOCKSZ );
	pixels1 = (char*)malloc( WFBLOCKSZ );
	pixOut = (char*)malloc( fSz );

	for( int i = 0; i < fSz / (2 * WFBLOCKSZ); i++ )
	{
		fread( pixels0, WFBLOCKSZ, 1, fIn );
		fread( pixels1, WFBLOCKSZ, 1, fIn );

		for( int j = 0; j < WFBLOCKSZ / WriteBlockSz; j++ )
		{
			memcpy( pixOut + 2 * i * WFBLOCKSZ + ( 2 * j + 0) * WriteBlockSz, &pixels0[ j * WriteBlockSz ], WriteBlockSz );
			memcpy( pixOut + 2 * i * WFBLOCKSZ + ( 2 * j + 1) * WriteBlockSz, &pixels1[ j * WriteBlockSz ], WriteBlockSz );
		}
	}

	fwrite( pixOut, fSz, 1, fOut );

	fclose( fIn );
	fclose( fOut );

	free(pixels0);
	free(pixels1);
	free(pixOut);

	return 0;
}
```


It's quite some time ago that I've used this, but I think this is only for the body of the DDS file.
Depending on the size of the output I think I manually added an appropriate DDS header.

Is there no progress on?

Can we up this theme again?
I saw tons of posts and informations and at laest now I understand why PNG don't want to open.
But still, what I must do to make it work?

I beg you for help!

Resurrecting a dead thread, but just wanted to add more info since this seems to be the only place talking about extracting textures.

I wanted to extract the PS4/Xbox/Switch exclusive skins from the archive (Warframe devs are lazy and leave those in the PC version) so I took a close look at the .png formats. I used Pesmontis's code as a base and went from there. His code allows you to extract BC1 compressed textures, but each BC has a different swizzle (not sure if swizzle is the right term). It's not obvious which texture is which BC, I take a best-guess from the metadata.

I'll look into dumping all textures from the game, but right now I'm working on extracting models from an older version of WF. A recent update dubbed "The Great Ensmallening" changed their archive format. GMman's cache extractor doesn't work anymore, and Ninjaripper yields squished models.

But anyway, Excalibur's BC5-compressed PS4 Emission map:
