- Post Title: (PSX) Asuncia (BINs containing GDTs and CHRs)

These are a couple of BINs I RAR'd together and I took a few peeks inside of them. There was mention of CHR and GDT files though I don't know which is the graphics but I am leaning toward GDT. In any case GDT I think is Graphic Data or somthing of that manner. Tell me whatever you find I'd love to hear about it. Yeah, another weird request XD. Curiousity I guess XD
