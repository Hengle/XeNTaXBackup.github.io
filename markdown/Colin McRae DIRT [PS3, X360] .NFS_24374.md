Hi guys, could you please help me unpacking this archive format? Alas, neither [this](http://aluigi.zenhax.com/bms/codemasters_nefs.bms) nor [that](https://github.com/victorbush/ego.nefsedit/releases) works.

[These are sample cuts from *.NFS archives](https://mega.nz/file/hIkDAQRb#1P9rymMauhSLE9iPouYwyVOdNBrgnILRO6002ZiOuqY), each one is bigger than 1GB so that I had to only provide parts of those bigfiles.

Bye & thanks in advance!

PS. When it comes to ALuigi's scripts I even checked out [this](http://aluigi.zenhax.com/bms/f12010_nefs.bms) & [that](http://aluigi.zenhax.com/bms/toyboxturbos.bms) but still no luck with getting a single file out of those NFS archives.

Hi, sorry for bumping you, but I have the same problem, except with GRID Autosport X360 DLC files. They aren't in NFS format, but in NEFS (which I'm assuming is similar to NFS)
When I use ANY of the quickbms scripts it outputs no files.
It would be nice to get these files extracted, as it's the only DLC files I can find for this delisted PC game and there are some pretty nice DLC cars.

Sample file pulled from my GitHub issue (you'll have to rename the file extension to nefs): [https://github.com/victorbush/ego.nefse ... m_high.txt](https://github.com/victorbush/ego.nefsedit/files/11658628/cam_high.txt) (Tyler McQuarrie Camaro, Road & Track Car Pack)
