Ghost of Tsushima tool.

Currently only main characters supported with skeletons & all textures.

Usage:

1. change .INI according to your game path. Tool expects game files in original folder structure. So for example, if you set .INI path to c:\games\tsushima, then inside of this folder must be "cache" folder with XPPS files (model, level and other data). And then inside of "cache" folder there must be "bitmaps" folder (raw texture data) and "meshes" folder (raw geometry data).

2. to convert a character model, drop its .XPPS file onto the tool. Right now only 20 main characters supported, which have their own separate XPPS files. This will produce ASCII file with model, additional SMD file with skeleton, and text file with material/textures description. Note that many submeshes have "alternative" texturing, sometimes even 10 or more options.

3. to convert ALL textures, type "tsushima tex". This will process all 20k+ textures and may take a lot of time. So if you dont want processing them all, just move some of them aside to only convert a part.

Only two questions:
1. Are you still working on this to expand what we can extract? 
2. Does it work with a Ghost of Tsushima .iso file and where can i get one?

no. If you have a PS4 and the game, you still can't get files.

It says how to on the usage "2. to convert a character model, drop its .XPPS file onto the tool. Right now only 20 main characters supported, which have their own separate XPPS files. This will produce ASCII file with model, additional SMD file with skeleton, and text file with material/textures description.

Thanks Daemon1 great work, works well, but for the weights of the vertices of the costume are connected with root joint instead of their specific joint of the skeleton. but I can take them back in a 3d software,
otherwise I would like to know if there is a way to recover for the animations of the skeleton and also the weapons of the characters (bow, katana  from file .xmesh)
also if there are other forum like yours that work on this game, thank you and good luck in your projects

The weights of the vertices of the costume MUST NOT be connected to joints of the skeleton. They are animated with physics, not the skeleton.

No, i dont have any forums.

You can download the xnalara plugin for blender and it will allow you to import ascii flies into blender. Then, all you have to do is re export the files as fbx.

Sorry for reviving this old thread, but could you post a clear walkthrough guide for extracting textures? I don't know where to write this "tsushima tex". i've tried creating a bat file, but clicking on it or trying to run it through command line seems to do nothing. Would appreciate any help. Side note: i already have the model extracted and converted into fbx, it's just the texture part that has me scratching my head.

If you got this far and already have models converted, in your folder where you have your required assets, ini, tool etc, you can right click on it while holding shift and run command in that folder, or you can go to address bar at the top inside that folder (not the search field on the right) and type cmd then hit enter and it will open cmd inside that folder, or you create a text and rename it from *.txt to *.bat and in either of the three options you type what daemon wrote, that's it, if first two opens used you hit enter or if using the batch you save that command then double click on it

Hello all. It's been quite a long while since i've dabbled in ripping stuff from the game. I've only now realised that there is quite a big issue with Norio's model upon extraction. Upon opening his model in blender, everything looks fine, except for the head– more specificlly, the eyes. They're almost closed and it makes him seem half asleep. 

This couldn't possibly be his default pose. Is there something missing? I have no clue how to get his eyes to return to normal as i've never really done eye posing, nor do i have the time and attention to manually return his eyes to the exact original state without dumping hours into this thing. I've also noticed this issue with the model for khotun khan. 

Im sure you've all faced this issue too as it seems to persist across several characters and i'd like to know if any of you have any tips or methods to resolve this issue. I'd like to end this by thanking you again for the help you've given me.

OK, so i've done some digging and i think the .smd file is supposed to be each character's skeleton. How would i go about applying the skeleton to a character? Keep in mind i'm something of a newbie in blender so i'll need some pretty clear instructions. I know it has something to do with importing the smd file into the armature, but i'm not sure how to make the skeleton apply itself to the armature, if that makes sense.

Just wanted to make sure if anyone else is having trouble finding certain textures. I myself can't find the diffuse texture for Norio's hair and facial hair. I was wondering if anyone else had the same issue? Is it a problem related to the pkg i have or does the tool simply not decrypt certain textures?
