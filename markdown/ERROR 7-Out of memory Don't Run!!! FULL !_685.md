Well, did MultiEx Commander EVER work for you? You've been at this forum for some time now, you could have posted this before, so I guess this problem is of late.

It worked always and now it does not?
Ok:

You clearly are not connected to the internet when you have to in the new version. 

> Uninstall all previous versions of MultiEx Commander. Make sure the folders are removed too. 
> Download the latest version 3.9.70
> Install it
> Stay or get connected to the internet 
> Run it.

I really don't know why you have this problem. If it worked before, try retracing what you did that made it not run afterwards.
