If you remove part of the file the reminder is being recognized by TRID on line as PCL (99%). According to FileExtension Bible PCL are 2D Graphic Page Control Language. 
Probable false lead, but who knows.

If you look at the file in Hex Editor there is distinct difference between parts of the file. First is a text listing of different body parts, woth Hex references, which can be perhaps easily deciphered (offsets   ) . 

Second part, TrID confirms @ 99% to be PCL. Its pretty strong confirmation wouldn't you say so? Maybe there are more than one textures try looking at offsets.
