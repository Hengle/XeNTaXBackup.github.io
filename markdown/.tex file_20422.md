Is there a way to batch process this format, even if the dimensions change?

you know quickbms? should be able to batch it, safely. formats afaifigureditout.  ask if you need more. gotta up the 'broken' samples ofc.

i'm somewhat certain it could be done in noesis too, but it's a execute "import and export on click file in folder thing" unpredictable reads and writes without a choice or display. not my kinda style of code.

Did you write this? It works perfectly and it can certainly be ran in batch. Is it easy to instead export to png? Thank you so much for your help

yep. and it was not about it being easier, but the batch process. qbms doesn't export png either way. just figured noesis has a batch function too. i never tried it tho. not gonna do now either. maybe somebody wants to recode this lil script to py syntax. i dunno.

and dds and the old dxt formats are commonly supported by modelling tools. and lighter on the video memory end. thought it's no issue.
