- Post Title: Velvet Assassin - .loc extension

Hi,

I am trying to translate Velvet Assassin. I found the file which (hopefully) contains the texts/strings for the game, but sadly I can't edit it.

Does somebody have any suggestions/tips/programs?

Ps.: The file 'eng.loc' is in the archive.

Should be really easy to edit/unpack

Open it with a hex editor 

You can see Filenames/Paths and the Text

I happened to have the code for it.
I made a little change to it for your purpose.
