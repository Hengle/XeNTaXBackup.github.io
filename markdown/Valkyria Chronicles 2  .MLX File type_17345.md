- Post Title: Valkyria Chronicles 2  .MLX File type

So I posted my Thread in the wrong section. sort of, I figured out what the file type I need to work with, but I can not figure out how to open it.

I have figured out that the models are .MLX files very much like the Valkyria Chronicles 1 game and 3 game. that means these are be alike. 

according to what I found in another thread the MLX files are protected by a 16 byte header that serves as a Key ? they are also supposed to start with IZCA if that helps?

So there are two ways I can do this with some help. but the simplistic way would be to update Gomthus import script that was made for the original Valkryia chronicles. since the files are so alike I wonder if this would be hard for someone?


Here is both the script and two example files along with a link to all the MLX files. 

I need these models to complete a mod that a lot of people are counting on me for and ripping them is not an option.
