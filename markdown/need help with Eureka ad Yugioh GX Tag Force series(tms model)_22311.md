- Post Title: need help with Eureka ad Yugioh GX Tag Force series(tms model)

Okay... so I was recently trying to extract the model and texture form a game call Eureka Seven AO(PS3) and Yugioh Tag force(PSP) series, and got into some trouble with the dae.gcm, dds.gcm(from eureka seven, i suppose that the gcm extension is some kind of compression), and .tms which is the model file for yugioh. After some wandering in the forum, up to this point I'm pretty sure that the .gcm is spme kind of compressed/encrypted phyre file and tms is model... Is there a way to convert them to common 3d file or extract the mesh out of them???
Here's the sample file
For tms

and for gcm.phyre
