- Post Title: Sangokushi Legion G1T Files

Hi there. Is there any way to open the G1T files from this game I have on my tablet? I uploaded them right here for someone to take a look at: [https://www.mediafire.com/file/c55tep94 ... 0Files.zip](https://www.mediafire.com/file/c55tep94iq0javd/Sangokushi%20Legion%20G1T%20Files.zip)

I tried using an existing G1T script to convert them into DDS files, but it didn't work. Somehow, I'm able to view them in Texture Finder, but the color palette looked all messed up when doing so. Please tell me, is there a program that can enable me to look at the G1T files? If it's Noesis (which I already have), does that mean a python script for the file format exists somewhere?
