- Post Title: A Metal Gear Solid (PSX) call to arms.

Hello everyone, I would like to mod my Metal Gear Solid (NTSC) for the PSX. I have already extracted all of the sounds with a helpful program (PSound) But would like to extract the polygon models or at least to know their hex address but they are inside a damn well encyrpted file. 

I am working on a mod to allow the player to play as other characters and to use boss weapons and attacks.

I am just going to extract the contents of the first disk for now and with the skills I hopefully learn I should be able to do the second disk

Here are the file names and size:

¬ SYSTEM (SpeedDial)          1 KB
¬ DUMMY3M.DAT           27001 KB
¬ SLUS_005.94                 636 KB
+ MGS                           
   ¬ BRF.DAT                   5662 KB
   ¬ DEMO.DAT            252542 KB
   ¬ FACE.DAT                 3426 KB
   ¬ RADIO.DAT               1736 KB
   ¬ SLUS_005.94              636 KB
   ¬ STAGE.DIR             70208 KB
   ¬ VOX.DAT               191420 KB
   ¬ ZMOVIE.STR            46394 KB

I would happily send you the files but I don't know what forum rules feel towards this so let me know.

Any information or help would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you in advance.
