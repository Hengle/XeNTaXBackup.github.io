Can someone help try to extract the textures from this msh file?

Been trying to figure out how to mod EA sports psp texture files for years.  It's MSH file format very similar to the FSH file format that has editors.  You can actually re-name it to FSH and open it and see the texture names just doesn't open textures correct.
