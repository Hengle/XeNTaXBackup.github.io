- Post Title: SEGA PRS file decompress

These are from Sega's Let's make a professional baseball team 3(PS2, Japan).
I got this in message folder, and almost every files are compressed by prs.
In hex editor, the header start as PRSH@, not just PRS.
I used some prs decompressors include quickbms but the results are not perfectly.
Also I re-compress some files, but their header is not start PRSH@.
So I think these are not a normal PRS files.

Somebody know how to handle these?

PS. "TUTORIAL.MES" file is only one that is not compressed in the game disc. The others are ***.mes.prs
