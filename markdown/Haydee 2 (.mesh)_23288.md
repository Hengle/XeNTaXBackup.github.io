I've not looked in much detail, but I can see this object in one of the .mesh files.  The data in those seems to start at 0x15c and each entry is 0x3c bytes (5038 vertices in this case).  I can see vertices and UVs, not sure about most of the rest.  The .skin file contains all the skeleton info, and .mtl has the texture names.

Thanks for looking into this, I've managed to find a Blender plugin [https://steamcommunity.com/app/1444650/ ... 266732111/](https://steamcommunity.com/app/1444650/discussions/2/2966146418266732111/)
