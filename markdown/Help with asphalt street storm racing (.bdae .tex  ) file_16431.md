hey.guys
[ asphalt street storm racing ]
This is a new game for gameloft on the google market  , and I want to extract its resources.

I extracted the game's model and texture files, but I didn't know how to open them.

game obb data : no file format type
model file format : *.bdae
texture file format : *.tex 

I tried using the GT Racing .bdae tool  but failed,

game download
