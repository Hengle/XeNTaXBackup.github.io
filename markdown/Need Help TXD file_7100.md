Keep in mind that steve's txd viewer was only tested with gta (and even from gta some txds don't work). This txd is probably different in one way or another. If you can wait, I might have a look on it as I'm planning to write sort of a renderware library (read & write dff and txd files). The dff part is mostly finished (it can even read ps2 and xbox dffs) but I haven't started with the txds yet (I, however, do know a bit about the ps2 format).

EDIT: oh, what the heck, I just ran my txd exporter over your file and it gave me some output textures. don't know if they're correct though.

Did you check the textures I gave you? Are they what you expected?

Looks like red and blue channel need to be swapped.
