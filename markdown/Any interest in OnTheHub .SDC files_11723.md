- Post Title: Any interest in OnTheHub .SDC files?

Not quite a GRAF, but it's an archive format nevertheless. .sdc files are Secure Digital Containers, the kind you get if you download software from Dreamspark. It's used not just for Microsoft software, but really any other Windows software downloaded from OnTheHub. I find the Secure Download Manager pretty useless and annoying, and I wrote an extractor back in March. With the rule changes, I'm not sure if I can actually post it here, so for now I'll just ask if there is enough interest for me to upload a copy here if allowed. It doesn't have any heuristics, so it can't extract files if you don't have the key to decrypt the header, which more or less puts using the program for piracy out of the question. (I'm in the process of writing a SDC generator to test as many SDC features as possible, so it may be a while before I can do final release.)
