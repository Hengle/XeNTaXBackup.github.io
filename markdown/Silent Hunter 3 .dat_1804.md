I was wondering if you could add support for Silent Hunter 3 .dat.

Oh not sure if this is within the scope of what you do, but there are also 2 other files important to the modding of this game. .sim and .zon, which we currently have no option but to hex edit only.

I am also interested in moding SH3. So here is what I know....

As far as *.dat files there is already unpacker available. You can find it at [http://www.subsim.com](http://www.subsim.com) in SH3 modding section. Or send me PM and I ll share it with you. It requires Java though. 

Now as far as two other files *.sim and *.zon I have no idea, but again perhaps I am not interested in SH3 enough to know it. Take a look at the forum recommneded above and do a search.

I found the "DatNavigator" thankyou.  Although slow, it does work. 

No luck with .sim or .zon though.

The moving properties is in the .sim file and the damage properties are in the .zon file. Browsing the .zon files with an hex editor, and appears to be individual values for each compartment in it,  three diferent structures could be identified with sphere radius, boxes size, armour level etc. 

So far no specific tool for that just Hex Editor, but some people are working on this.
