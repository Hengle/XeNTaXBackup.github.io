- Post Title: Help with Project Diva Dreamy Theater Bones

so. I was able to get from blender the original bones rig, but it is corrupted. Now, i heard someone talking about a new 3ds max script which fixes it, but since i tried to install 3dsmax on my pc and it don't work, i would like to ask if it is possible in a way trough blender
Also i am not that expert in this camp so please be patient
