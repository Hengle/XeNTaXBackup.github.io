- Post Title: Request: Tekken 6 and/or WWE 2011 (PSP!)

Hey guys, I'm a 3d "artist" who is mostly interested in making handheld-spec assets. I'm currently trying to improve my meshes and workflow by studying commercial models, but they're relatively hard to find (I have some Crisis Core models though). If possible, I would like to request a couple of character models (preferably with texture sheets) from Tekken 6 and/or WWE: Road to Wrestlemania 2011. Particulary interested in these titles, because the meshes will have to hold up in the most extreme poses possible -- this is interesting, at least for me.

I have a Tekken 6 iso laying around (yeah, I actually bought the game), but am too much of a moron to figure this out on my own. Again, I would like to emphasize that this is purely for educational purposes and that I have no intent of redistributing anything in any kind of way, ever.

If this could be done, I'll make a small donation to support this joint.   

Thanks
