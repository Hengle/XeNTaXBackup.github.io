GAP has the ability to export 'RAW' file-data from any of its catalog of supported game archives, irregardless of the file-type.
In order to do so:
Click on the options button -> select "AF Plug-Ins" tab -> highlight "ANX RAW Audio File Plug-in" and click "Configure"
Inside the "Add files" box: select "Always", then Click OK (x2).

After you've done that; all you have to do is drag your BLB resource file in into GAP's playlist view and when promted, select "Add file(s)".
A box will then appear asking you to specify which of the files contained within the BLB archive you'd like to display within the playlist, individually.
Assuming you would prudishly like them all, click "Select All" (    ) and click ok.
Finally; select all of the files within your playlist and click the "Save file(s) button at the top of the playlist view, and the rest should be pretty obvious to follow.

Also, for anybody interested, there is a BLB file-format description here: [http://wiki.multimedia.cx/index.php?title=BLB](http://wiki.multimedia.cx/index.php?title=BLB) 
Pretty interesting archive structure  i'd say quite unlike anything i've seen elsewhere.

Hopefully this was of some help to you, mate   

Gr8 game btw
