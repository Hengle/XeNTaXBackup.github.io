- Post Title: Legend of the Galactic Heroes (2008) - Help Needed

Hello all,

I would like to mod Legend of the Galactic Heroes (2008), translate it into English. I watched some of Mr. Mouse's videos and read the [The Definitive Guide to Exploring File Formats](http://wiki.xentax.com/index.php/DGTEFF) - both helped a lot.

Two things are eluding me and I hope you can help me:

 Filedata length - can't find where it is 

 Filedata (with padding) seems to be a multiple of 1024 bytes.
 Decompression

 Supposedly the files are ARC, but none of the ARC unarchivers I found could open them.
Sample Files

[http://s000.tinyupload.com/index.php?fi ... 9784451814](http://s000.tinyupload.com/index.php?file_id=92228317999784451814) (140kB)

The archive contains 4 files:

 loading.mvx

 contains 1 uncompressed text file and 2 .mvx files
 loading.hbk

 HexWorkshop bookmarks for loading.mvx. Includes Filename Directory, File List and some other info I could glean
 datatable.mvx

 this file was previously translated by a modding effort, but the unpacker has been lost to the sands of time
 contains 17 files, all appear to be compress
 first file contains names of the in-game Characters
 datatable.hbk

 HexWorkshop bookmarks for datatable.mvx.
Reference

Demo (162 MB)
Game Homepage
Discussion with Developer who made an unpacker years ago (no longer to be found)
Previous translation effort
I would very much appreciate any pointers you have.
