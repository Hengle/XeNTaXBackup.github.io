- Post Title: How to extract to Super Mecha Champions's NPK files?

I want to extract to NetEase's Super Mecha Champions(SMC)'s NPK files.

Although bms script is used, the following error occurs.

```
--------------------------------------

- 0 files found in 0 seconds
  coverage file 0     0%   342012     686642800  . offset 28ec4b40

Press ENTER or close the window to quit

```


And also use EXPKDec, it also causes errors.

```

```


What can I do? I attached SMC's NPK file. [https://we.tl/t-VPFbiYbfqc](https://we.tl/t-VPFbiYbfqc)
