- Post Title: Extracting audio from a Gundam game

Hello there! I'm trying to extract the audio from a PS3 Gundam game. From what i've heard, sounds are stocked inside ".sdat" files. But it's only 1251kb, so I don't think it's this one.

Does anyone have an idea of which file is stocking all the audio and how can I extract it? Thank you very much.

If you can upload the SDATs we could help further!
