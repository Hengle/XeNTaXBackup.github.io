- Post Title: CoD: Online - XMA sounds

Help! Me and my friend are trying to solve a problem which we have tried many Xbox 360 sound decoders to one file and they all didn't work, including ffmpeg. This is the file.

Yes, its a XMA.

Isn't CoD: Online only on PC? I can't find any source saying it is on Xbox 360 or even Xbox One.

Additionally, there are no flags in the sample you submitted that appear in every XMA file so it's probably not XMA.

I think it is 4-bit ADPCM @ 48000Hz with a single mono channel but the resulting file has some noise that I'm not sure is actually part of the file.

If you can provide a music track sample that would definitely help though.

File extensions aren't always 100% reliable.

Can you upload more samples please?

Because if it is indeed XMA, than this will be a first ever time that XMA has been cross platform and not just for an Xbox console.
