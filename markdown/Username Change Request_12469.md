- Post Title: Username Change Request?

I'm sorry if I may be posting this in the wrong location, but I was wondering how I can go about requesting a username change on this account of mine. Nothing special, just to a five letter username. Thanks in advance.

Mod edit: further name change requests should be posted in viewtopic.php?f=22&t=22003; this thread has been locked accordingly.

Thank you.

There's already an account by that name, though judging by the email addresses, it's your account. Do you want it deleted and this account renamed?

Oh yes, it's one of my old account so you are cleared to remove and change my name.

I would like to tell you, I can't access to that account since I can't get to my email because of that damn google sign in verify it's you bs, so that's why I made a new email and account.

I created this email on Jun 2, 2018 (If I remember correctly)

And for an old email, I created that on Nov 29, 2016 (if I remember correctly too)

Further name change requests should be posted in [viewtopic.php?f=22&t=22003](https://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=22&t=22003), I've locked this thread accordingly.
