I'll appreciate any help or guidance to unpack the "*.stg"-archive of the "Lost Lagoon - The Trail of Destiny" game. 
The head.bin and tail.bin may be downloaded here: [http://www.motionpress.com/uploads/Lost ... adTail.zip](http://www.motionpress.com/uploads/LostLagoonHeadTail.zip)

Thanks in advance!

Tried it using Jaedernaub, and it worked great, you wont get the exact filenames though, since Jaeder is a bruteforce scanner, and not a de-archiver.
so if you want full filenames you would need to wait for a BMS script.

else, just head over to [http://www.jaedernaub.com](http://www.jaedernaub.com) and download my ripper.
File/Load , press Load file into Jaeder Naub, press the Scan button on Main screen, and it will put everything in "ripped" folder.

Here is a simple extractor proggy for the .STG archives.
It's a beta version, so it may contain some bugs.
I tested on these games:

- Lost Lagoon: The Trail of Destiny
- Insider Tales: Vanished in Rome
- Insider Tales: The Stolen Venus
- Color Eggs
