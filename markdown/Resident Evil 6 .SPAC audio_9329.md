- Post Title: Resident Evil 6 .SPAC audio

Came across this while exploring the RE6 360 Demo files. 
I don't normally tinker with console files, so I don't know if this is common procedure, but, something worth noting for this file is everything is written backwards inside it. 
The header, "SPAC", becomes "CAPS", "RIFF" is "FFIR", "WAVE fmt" is now "EVAW tmf", etc. (As shown [here](http://i.imgur.com/ivbnS.jpg).) 

I'm a novice at things like this, so sorry in advance if I can't keep up with your replies.

I've included the sample below in it's entirety.

I decoded this before by hand editing out each xma steam, it's simply a header, but in the big endian format i'd assume. the xma starts a while in, and each spac i saw had anywhere from one stream to twenty five. You can normally find the start of a stream by searching for the hex values 00 01 00 with the stream's start being XX 00 01 00 0X where X= any whole number. then you should be able to decode with xmash and towav.

I already made a tutorial to unpack all .SPC audio for the Xbox 360 version of Resident Evil 6.

Seconded. Could really use that tool, there doesn't seem to be another method of extracting the audio.
