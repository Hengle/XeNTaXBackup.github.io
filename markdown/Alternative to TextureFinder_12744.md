- Post Title: Alternative to TextureFinder?

Hey Guys,

I was wondering if theres a tool with the same functionality as TextureFinder but without TextureFinders drawbacks.

Main Drawbacks in TextureFinder are, being unable to export in batch and having to export an image in 2 parts if its larger than the viewport.


My issue is that I've got roughly 2000 images in DDS format, some DX1 and some DX3, they're all swizzled, if I simply change the Shift in TextureFinder I can see the images clearly and export with no problem. But due to the above 2 issues the whole process takes a while for 1 image, and is going to take a lot longer for 2000 images, is there any software that does the same thing that I might be able to use instead?

I don't mind what the exported format is, or even if it just changes the shift and leaves the format alone.
