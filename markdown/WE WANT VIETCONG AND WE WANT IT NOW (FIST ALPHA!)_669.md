- Post Title: WE WANT VIETCONG AND WE WANT IT NOW (FIST ALPHA!)

C'mon baby! This program would, I think, be the first vietcong extractor (please correct me if I am wrong [with links ]).

It would be especially cool now that the vietcong expansion is out! Thanks. I think it's mostly CBF files. I know there are some posts about this already but I just wanted to make the demand accurate. Thank you.

See the highlighted word? Nobody is in any position to demand anything from me. I hope that is clear. The CBF issue will be dealt with in due time. Until then the free MultiEx Commander is available for download on servers that we pay for with our own cash. So people like you can download it free of charge. Refrase your words carefully next time.
