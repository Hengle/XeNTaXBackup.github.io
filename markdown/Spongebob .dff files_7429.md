- Post Title: Spongebob .dff files

Hi all, I'm working on a TF2 project using these models, but some of the characters I need, their version won't import into max using the GTA dff importer tool, while a majority of them will import, the models that won't seem to be version 3.5 of the dff format, which I thought was teh reason it wouldn't import, but I was able to get prop models that were in the same version format. so now I'm stuck at what to do. I'm just wondering if there is anyone willing to make a script that can read these few files I need.    

I get this error when I attempt to import

```

```


thanks to anyone that attempts to get them, I'll give credit when I finish the project and release it

I tried seeing if they used a different file version on the ps2 and xbox versions of the game, no luck, same deal.


well anyway, here is some progress on the mod
