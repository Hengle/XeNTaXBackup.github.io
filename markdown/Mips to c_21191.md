- Post Title: Mips to c

I recently just tried to do some mips to c can someone tell me if this is right I think I did some of it right if someone does correct it can you tell me where I messed up at im really confident that I got a lot of it right what im doing here is trying to reverse engineer a piece of code from a popular ps2 game so much help would be appreciated thank you.

MIPS:

		    var_20          = -0x20
		    var_10          = -0x10

	            addiu   $sp, -0x20       # Add Immediate Unsigned
                    sd      $ra, 0x20+var_10($sp)  # Store Doubleword
                    sq      $s0, 0x20+var_20($sp)  # Store Quadword
                    move    $s0, $a0
                    bnez    $a1, loc_13DF88  # Branch on Not Zero
                    nop

                    move    $a0, $s0
                    jal     sub_13DF20       # Jump And Link
                    nop
                    move    $a0, $v0
                    move    $a1, $zero
                    la      $a2, aAmobject_c  # "amObject.c"
                    li      $a3, 0x8A  # 'Ã¨'  # Load Immediate
                    jal     sub_13AAB0       # Jump And Link
                    nop
                    move    $a1, $v0
                    nop

                    sw      $v0, 4($a1)      # Store Word
                    addiu   $v1, $a1, 8      # Add Immediate Unsigned
                    move    $a0, $zero
                    b       loc_13DFB8       # Branch Always

		sub_13DF20();

		a0 = v0; // zeroing out the address
		a1 = 0; // zeroing out the address
		a3 = aAmobject_c; // aAmobject_c is a address to something

		sub_13AAB0();

Not really. More like:

```
unsigned int *function(unsigned int *pointer1, unsigned int *pointer2)
{
	if (pointer2 == NULL)
	{
		//pointer2 = NULL; //useless
		pointer2 = sub_13AAB0(sub_13DF20(pointer1), pointer2, "amObject.c", 0x8a);
	}
	pointer2[0] = (unsigned int)pointer1;
	pointer2[1] = pointer1[4];
	
	unsigned int *tempPointer = pointer2 + 2;
	for (unsigned int i = 0; i < pointer2[1]; i++, tempPointer += 2)
	{
		tempPointer[0] = 0;
		tempPointer[1] = 0;
	}
	return pointer2;
}
```


I just quickly scanned it, so there may be mistakes, but it should be mostly correct. It is possible all these were void**, not unsigned int*, but the usage later as both pointer storage (32bit system) and counters suggests otherwise.
