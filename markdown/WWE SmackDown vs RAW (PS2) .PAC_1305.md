Do a search at the WIKI for PAC  

[http://wiki.xentax.com/index.php/Main_Page](http://wiki.xentax.com/index.php/Main_Page)

You'll find some hits. 

The one from Rumble Roses is the one to go for. Note however, that the format is still far from complete.

I can view all of the textures and modify them in the CH.PAC and CH2.PAC files.  I'll keep you informed if I get a working program.   I've been know to let some buggy software go, lately.   Trying to make sure this doesn't happen this time.

If you want to check out the textures on the CH.PAC and CH2.PAC files, you can download this:

[http://www.angelfire.com/oz2/oz21/SVsRPacXtractor.zip](http://www.angelfire.com/oz2/oz21/SVsRPacXtractor.zip)

Should keep you busy for a little while.  Preliminary work, so don't expect too much.  Make sure you have the latest visual basic runtimes installed.

I really wish I could understand the models.  I can't seem to decipher the format.  Have a few clues but not enough to reconstruct the 3d data.  I'll keep you posted.

Jasmine, this tool works great, except for one thing. The face textures seem to be discolored. Almost like they are being exported with fewer colors than required. All of the other textures are fine, it's just the faces. Have a look....

I marked all files and extracted them, no error occured for me

dont know if i may ask this here, but how do i burn the modified files back so the game boots
Im pretty sure it wont boot up when i just burn all files as a data disc.

I have the original PAL Game btw so its not illegal

Hey Jasmine, maybe you could modify your SDVR tool to support SYM and HCTP. Those games had some great textures that would be worth extracting....

EDIT:

> hello people dont meen to bug you but how do i get the textures to be right and not corrupted colours? when i export them threw the SVR xtractor? much apreciated

I thought they were corrupted too, but I guess they are supposed to be that way. It makes no sense to me why they would make the face textures of all things with so few colors, but i guess they did....

Hi mate,

Game Extractor did open the archive for you, as is indicated by the files listed on the left. However, there are a lot of problems with this game because the archives are not the same as PC games - so when opening the archive it has only shown some of the files in the archive.

One solution, if you only want the image files, is to purchase the Full Version of Game Extractor which has a scanner to find TIM2 images, but it isn't in the Basic Version.

I am sorry but there is not much that can be done about this game, and the same goes for many other PS2 and PS1 games

Main question is: how is what you ask related to this topic?
