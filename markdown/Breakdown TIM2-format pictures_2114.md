- Post Title: Breakdown TIM2-format pictures?

I've found what looks like TIM2 images in the XBOX game "Breakdown", but no TIM2 viewer I've used yet opens them. They are all in a single directory, and all of their extensions are numbers, like "gallery.000" "gallery.001". There are 20 gallery.xxx files, and all of them are 258KB in size. But also in the directory is a file called "gallery.pak". Are these TIM2 files compressed under the main .pak file?

Here's an example:

I know this is really old but I can confirm that the tm2 files will work with noesis. I bring it up because at the moment I am looking into this game
