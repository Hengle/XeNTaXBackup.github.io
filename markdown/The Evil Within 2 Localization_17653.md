Text files are in the loc_01.pkr and p1_loc_01.pkr file. These files are in the base and patch folders.

hi, what about changing the font? i have a ttf font but it seems I should use xml font. I dont know how to use my font.
and when I use my own lang in string files the game show me sth like this: **********
This is because the font used in game doesn't have my lang characters?
