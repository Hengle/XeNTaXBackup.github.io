Hello,

I'm unable to extract any resource file. Everytime I try MultiEx it opens up a resource only to show a Content.bin inside of it. I have tried many different games, I'm not sure what's going on. I'm using Win7 x64 and tried WinXP SP3 comparability mode but I don't think that's the problem.

For this particular session I tried Serious Sam 2, which I'm pretty sure should work. Also tried WinXP, same thing. Am I doing something wrong? Thanks.

Yes, that does work. You should click the Open As... button to tell MultiEx Commander how to treat that file.

I see. Problem was between a chair and keyboard   , I always had "*.*" selected when opening up archives. Solved.
