Once extracted with emil.exe you get loads of .xap files. These have multiple formats inside including textures/models/materials/. Can some one make a noesis or max plugin to import them? Textures are already supported/ someone made a converter to dds so I just need the models.
Here are some example files

Examples include character files, ones marked as npc, and ones marked as player. Weapons, and parts of a level.
