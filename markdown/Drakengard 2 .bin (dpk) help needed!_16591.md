- Post Title: Drakengard 2 .bin (dpk) help needed!

(Yes, I know, DG2. I wouldn't be doing this if I could get what I were after elsewhere...)

So, I'm trying to datamine the ""classic"" ps2 game Drakengard 2. The game's files consist mostly of .bin files with the header of dpk. Are there any resources out there that relate to mining this game? Tried all relevant bms scripts, didn't get any results.
