I think my region can't access the .kr website and so can't download it.
Looking for other link but by research brought nothing since now...

someone needs to create a login for that site to get the download currently.
this link is useless just installs the active x downloader that needs a login to work

The game isn't even in closed beta yet (it starts august 24th and last 5 days).
I have a login for the site and applied for beta, i can share the account data in PM if it helps gathering DL links. Though i don't think they have any game DL ready yet.
