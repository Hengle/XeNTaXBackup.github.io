Yeah, I know it's a kinda old adventure game, but I'd like to do some modding on it, if possible.
And also do a translation, as well, but first we have to extract the game files.

It can be downloaded for free (it officially became a freeware in 2007) eg.: here: [http://www.theisozone.com/downloads/pc/ ... honia-usa/](http://www.theisozone.com/downloads/pc/dos-games/igor-objective-uikokahonia-usa/)

I have already found out the igor.fsd file should contain speeches, because it starts with the following text string: "Creative Voice File"

I think that graphics, codes and texts should be in igor.dat

You can check the old source (not available anymore) of ScummVM engine [here](http://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/scummvm/browser/scummvm/trunk/engines/igor?rev=31888).
Or a [more recent](http://cyxdown.free.fr/igor/) continuation of the project on [github](https://github.com/cyxx/igor) by Cyx.
