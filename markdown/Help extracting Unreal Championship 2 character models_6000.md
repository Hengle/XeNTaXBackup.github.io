- Post Title: Help extracting Unreal Championship 2 character models?

There is someone who is porting all the Unreal Championship 2 character models to Unreal Tournament 2004.  Can anyone help this guy finish the extraction of the models?  He's got most of it done but there are a few missing parts as listed in the "known issues" section at the bottom of his post...
