I didn't read so much about extracting those models because i'm not so interested into them. Anyway your problem is only how to import the 3d meshes into max right? The .bpe file not contain any 3d model, only the .yobj format has it. After the extraction of the .pac archives.. u should have a bunch of files expecially .yobj. Actually the only method i know is to use the max script of chrrox to import .yoby into max. If this script doesn't work with your ps2 .yobj files (try the 2 versions of the scrip on them) I have no idea about howc onverting them. Good luck


EDIT: i hope u know how to use a max script.
