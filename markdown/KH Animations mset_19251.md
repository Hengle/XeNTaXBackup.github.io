- Post Title: KH Animations mset

Hello! I'm trying to make a Halloween display for the side of my house using projection mapping. We have a KH family, so I found the models that have been ripped from the game. I know they're rigged, but I'd really like the animations so that I'm not trying to attempt them from scratch. I've animated one thing in my life and it was... tedious and janky.

Do I need to rip the models and animations from the game? I was hoping for a shortcut, because the models are available as downloads. Does anyone have the animations (.mset files) available?

(I'm learning as I go, please forgive me for sounding like it!)

There are tools for extract models/animations from KH2, I did some times, many years ago. But I think nobody did a tool for the animation extract for KH.
