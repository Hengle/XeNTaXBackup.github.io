- Post Title: Dagor Engine dynmodel (WarThunder\Enlisted)

So, for a long time I was trying to get some assets from WarThunder\Enlisted. So far the only real way I found was to load models into WT asset viewer and rip them with ninja ripper, but this method is not the best to say the least.

Pretty much, since its a  Dagor Engine all models data is stored in .grp files, contents of which can be extracted with .bms script. I've tried it on Elisted and it worked, so it will work with WT aswell.

After extracting .grp you get pretty much 5 files:
dynmodel - which is model itself
fastphys - self-explanatory
phobj - self-explanatory
skeleton - probably contains rig data
Char - dont know what it is, but its mostlikely something game related

This was a progress, but right now I am completly stucked. I have 0 idea what could be done with dynmodel in order to get it at least into a somewhat readable format to later use it in in blender\3ds max. Tried to seach about it, but with no success.

Here I include samples of one extracted model, if someone have any idea of what could be done at this point I would really appreciate it.

Any chance you can grab the spitfire airplane form enlisted for me? i know nothing about quickbms and scripting and whatnot. OBJ or FBX is fine.

Thank you for the .grp file, but I don't know how can I unpack it.
