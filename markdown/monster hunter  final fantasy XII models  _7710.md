Nobody should be giving you a game, you can go out and buy it.
If you chose not to, here is not the place to ask for illegitimate versions of a game.

Use the search bar, I've seen a thread before that has links to some tools for exploring the ff12 files.
The search tool is your friend....

And one note for you. Just have model viewer with FF12 and it dont support export model to other format. 
You can use 3rd software to rip from Model Viewer tool but the model usually have bug when ripping in this way. You must flip face to complete the model,

Hope you like it. Welcome to the forum ...
