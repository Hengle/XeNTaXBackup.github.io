Here is a simple extractor: [https://mega.co.nz/#!eRwEBK5B!GMUBWsa1R ... 6UUuro5VXw](https://mega.co.nz/#!eRwEBK5B!GMUBWsa1RUWCScP5mpQ5UWGLNzbUDYG1v6UUuro5VXw)

I couldn't find the filenames, don't know if you have some idea.

How to use this extractor?
Edit:
It's working just for some types of paks, not for all
i will upload an example in a few moments
example pak file that's not extracted: [https://mega.co.nz/#!0F1B3TQJ!n6X3NEQOs ... XiWs1earHg](https://mega.co.nz/#!0F1B3TQJ!n6X3NEQOsRu2OrdPf5BKFCQ6MEVhjGG97XiWs1earHg)

To use simply drag and drop the file in the executable or go to the command line and type "pak_extractor filename.Pak".

I was stupid. There was an error in the executable, the program was always opening the Cs.Pak file. Now it should work: [https://mega.co.nz/#!eRwEBK5B!GMUBWsa1R ... 6UUuro5VXw](https://mega.co.nz/#!eRwEBK5B!GMUBWsa1RUWCScP5mpQ5UWGLNzbUDYG1v6UUuro5VXw). Try with your files and please tell me if you notice any error.

Where did i find the extractor, is that what you are saying? If it is, i made it myself.
