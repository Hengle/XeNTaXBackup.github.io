- Post Title: Need Help Decrypting PSP PAK File from Super Danganronpa 2

While messing around with the game's files, I found pak files that are supposed to hold all the 3D backgrounds in the game. Unfortunately, I can't seem to find a way to extract the GMO files inside the paks.

Would anyone be able to help?

Here's a link to a few of the pak files.
