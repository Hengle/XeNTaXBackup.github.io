- Post Title: SED and SWD files?

Apologies if this isn't in the right section, but from what I've googled, it seems that these files are audio files similar to MIDI. 

I'm taking apart the files from Arc Rise Fantasia, and am trying to find the sound files for the in-battle sound effects. I've found the commentary and background music in ADX and AFS format, but the sound effects are not in the same format.

The headers are SEDB and SWDB, and the SED files are around 1KB while the SWD varies but are larger than the SED files.

I don't know a lot about hex editing, but the SED files only seem to show the name of the file and some very short data, leading me to believe that the actual sound is in the SWD file and the SED file might be for information reference or something.

I'm pretty new to this whole game ripping/dumping thing so any help on this would be highly appreciated. Thank you!
