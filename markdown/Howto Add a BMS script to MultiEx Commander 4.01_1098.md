- Post Title: Howto: Add a BMS script to MultiEx Commander 4.01

To add a custom Binary MultiEx Script (BMS) to your MultiEx Commander supported scripts do the following:


1. Locate and backup the MC.MRF file in the data/config directory of MultiEx Commander. 

2. Open this MC.MRF file using MexBinder Plus ( http://multiex.xentax.com ) 

3. Click 'Add Single Format' and point to the new BMS file in the browser that is presented

Note: the BMS file may have a name of max three characters (i.e. the file extension of the archive in question , e.g. PAK.BMS)

4. Type in the name of the game that the archive belongs to when asked for, and specify the nature of the archive if more than one different formats exist for the same file extension for the same game. 
(e.g. 'Sacred Textures' )

5. Click 'Create MRF'  and save the new MC.MRF file (overwrite the old one in the data/config directory). 

Done! Now start MultiEx Commander 4.01 and you can select it as usual from the Open Archive dialog!

Ahh..yes. I know I know. I promised you guys to release a version that would work with the new mc.mrf format. I will make it my top priority to release a version that can open them. 

It will however not be backward compatible with earlier MRF files, and it will require registration of MexCom. I'm sure you can see why

Soon I will release the new MultiEx Commander.
