- Post Title: DMPBM Image Files (Devil Survivor Games on 3ds)

Have anyone can Extract and Encode DMPBM Files?
I know ScarletConvert can Extract, but it only can Extract, and it cannot read some files.

Simple Files (w/ LZ77&without LZ77, are from DSOC JPN): [https://anonfiles.com/B6X83eE2u5/DSOC-Tex-Simple_7z](https://anonfiles.com/B6X83eE2u5/DSOC-Tex-Simple_7z)
THANKS!
