Help unzip files from the game beta Predator, .pak is already unpacked. I have files with models and textures .uasset and .uexp.

After closing the beta game servers, Umodel abruptly stopped detecting the files of this game. Umodel is now useless

It was possible to correct the error and get the body mesh of Female Predator.
The head should be near until found.
