- Post Title: Mafia lost city of heaven .DX1 graphic file format

Hi,
I recently decideded to remake the graphics for the game(textures) but I've ran into a small problem, there are graphic file extentions .DX1, if someone could make a convert tool (like from .dx1 to DDS and back"  it'd be real nice.

I'm remaking the game cause it's an old classic taht everyone loved. so it deserves some new stuff in it.

Thanks,
J

I think you can open the files with the "DirectX Texture Editor (Dxtex.exe)" of the DirectX SDK.
