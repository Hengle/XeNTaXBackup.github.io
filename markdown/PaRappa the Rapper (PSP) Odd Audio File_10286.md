- Post Title: PaRappa the Rapper (PSP) Odd Audio File

In PaRappa the Rapper for PSP, I managed to get these .wav files out of the main game archive. However, they don't play correctly in windows media player with the ATRAC3 codec, and converting them with an online converter makes them sound all split up. Could someone look at this?
