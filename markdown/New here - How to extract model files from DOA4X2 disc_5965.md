New here! So, sorry if this is a noob question, but I cannot find a successful method to extract model files from my DOA4/X2 discs. WXRipper's failed, as has Xbox Backup Tool. Can anybody here offer tools/advice on how to get the files out? So far, I've been able to produce an 893 MB ISO from DOAX2, but I don't know if it really contains anything useful or not...

xbox back up creator. extract the afs files and use noesis to extract those afs, and then use the same program to convert those extracted files to the format you want.

I have that, but it won't let me back up my disc for some reason (the Start button is greyed out, even with the disc in the drive). I have ImgBurn installed, but not Nero... would I need that as well to be able to extract from my discs? This is kind of confusing...

Really? I do legally own DOA4 and X2, but would that still be illegal to download an ISO for a game I already own? I'd still prefer to rip my own discs... if Xbox Backup Creator would let me, anyway, the Start button is greyed out, how do I let it rip? My DVD drive's a TSSTcorp DVD+-RW TS-H553A, if it helps at all with configuring XBC.

maybe the .iso file that you ripped from the disc is corrupted or broken
have you tried to use this tool

I have that, and both wx360 and XBC have failed at ripping anything usable for me. I'm looking for for any help for why XBC refuses to let me rip my games so I can extract/view the models with Noesis.   

EDIT: Screenshot of what I mean...

So I've been told there's a program that works for DOA3 and Xtreme 1 called Greed Xplorer. Any chance anyone has that and could send it to me so I could at least try that since there seems to be problems with getting DOA4 to work?

Lol, sorry, can't help with that... been looking for that as well, actually. I still can't get DOAX2 or DOA4 ripped, and I'd still like some tips on how to get XBC working, since the problem also extends to the rest of my collection (The Orange Box, and Mass Effect 2). Is XBC dependent on a few select DVD drives or will it work with any drive? I have a screenshot of the issue I'm running into in my previous post, if it's of any help. Oh yeah... does Noesis work with DOA3/XBV models or just DOA4 onward?

You'd be right, Noesis has no plugin for DOA4 models. Not that it matters to me right now anyways, since I still cannot get either DOA4 or X2 ripped using wxRipper, wx360, or Xbox Backup Creator. Just what could I be doing wrong? In all seriousness, this is starting to really tick me off, because I have been trying for at least a week to get X2 ripped without success. Are there any guides to ripping games using XBC or anyone here that might be able to help me get it ripped? Sorry if I sound ungrateful, I'm just kinda frustrated over how difficult ripping a single game is turning out to be...

Noesis can also extract the contents of 360 disc (XDVDFS) ISO's. As far as physically ripping disc images, though, the only way I know of requires you to have a disc drive that's compatible with Kreon firmware. There might also be a way to pipe it through a modded 360 and/or 360 disc drive. I really have no idea when it comes to that side of things, though.

I've still not looked into DOA4 or any other prior DOA title. I would be happy enough to whip up a DOA4 plugin if someone would share the format specs. It's already on my to-reverse list, but I haven't had time or energy lately to take on reversing new formats myself.

to dump a xbox360 ISO, theres about 3 methods.

(1) Use the xbox360 drive. either by way of using a hacked xbox360 [ii]or by way of using the xbox360 drive in your PC
(2) Modify the firmware of a normal DVD reader, but the firmware hacks are limited a few drives the hackers support
(3) Hotswap a DVD movie in a normal PC DVDdrive
(4) of course is piracy.. although some laws are getting VERY strict. so do so at your own discretion

my way is using #1 although previous to that I used method #3, basically you place a DVD movie in your computer. and when the drive spins down, use the emergency eject to swap the movie with a retail xbox360 disc. then you can use something like wxripper360 to read files directly off the disc or dump the whole thing

the xbox360 protection is pretty simple, the table of contents directs your PC to a movie file.. and thus it doesn't read the second table of contents, which holds all the data. the swap method bypasses the first table of contents, and lets a program like wxripperdx to freely read the disc at will. this circumvenes the need to hack the DVD drives reading routines. :0 yay right

Yeah, I'm aware of the methods used for wxripper360, but so far, all that's gotten me is either a useless 222 MB or a useless 1.3 GB ISO. If I'm right, any DVD that's over 7.5 GB in size should work, but after finding the "magic number", altering the necessary files to dummy/copy/whatever, I still get nothing usable. Does the hotswap disc need to be unprotected? I do sometimes get errors about "sector encryption" or something like that.

EDIT: Torrent finally finished, and I'm surprised that the heads are separate from the bodies...

in doa4, they did something funny. they tripled the polycount on the head, and the hair system was also replaced. but most of the bodies were re-used from the old xbox1 games

they followed through with this in DOAX2, when they redid the bodies for the tanning and new boobie morph system. but all the girls share the same body.. so they really cheaped out

basically they've been doing hack jobs on their games.. doa was really on its last lag

Eh, whatever helps save on resources, I suppose.  Even if that's the case, they've done a good job of hiding it...

HELLO PEOPLE!!!

Thanks for make this forum. But I have a situation for resolve.
First situation: 
I have DOAX2 ISO (for XBOX 360), but the site where I get it said "nude patch", and I used "Noesis program" for extract the models and I only found the models without costumes (  ), the same thing happen to me with DOAX 1 but I found the bikinis in other .AFS.
Do you know where and how can I get the costumes for the characters???

The ISO game have:
7,641,262 KB=7.29GB
The characters are in .tpr
The items are in .tpr
The stages are in .tp
I found some archives called werone.afs and wertwo.afs, but there are only elements called "archives".

Thanks for your help and attention
