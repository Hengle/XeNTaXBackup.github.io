The bdt&bhd for Armored Core V is very similar to Dark Souls.
Did you try [viewtopic.php?f=10&t=7852&start=0](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=7852&start=0)
May be sib file is container for model. tpf is texture?

```
N:\ACV\data\model\map\m0600\model_sib\m0005.sib
```

Ok, i did it.
But, an error occurred while unpacking.

And dvdbnd.bdt have a different header from Dark Souls's bdt.

offzip -a dvdbnd.bdt extract 0x0
```

Unfortunately, this batch script did not complete,

Just use my script. func_getTYPE.bms can be found here: [viewtopic.php?f=13&p=69577#p69577](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=13&p=69577#p69577). Just save it in the same directory as the below script.

```
# supported games: Armored Core V (Xbox 360)
#
# (c) 2012-03-25 by AlphaTwentyThree of XeNTaX

include "func_getTYPE.bms"
open FDDE bhd 0
open FDDE bdt 1

endian big
idstring "BHD5" 0
get ZERO long 0
get UNK long 0
get FSIZE long 0
get GROUPS long 0 # file groups?
get UNK long 0
set FNUMB 0
for i = 1 <= GROUPS
	get FILES long 0 # number of files of same group
	get INFO long 0
	savepos MYOFF 0
	goto INFO 0
	for j = 1 <= FILES
		get NAME_CRC long 0
		get SIZE long 0
		get ZERO long 0
		get OFFSET long 0
		get NAME basename 0
		callfunction constructname 1
		endian little
		callfunction getTYPE 1
		endian big
		string NAME += EXT
		log NAME OFFSET SIZE 1
	next j
	goto MYOFF 0
next i

startfunction constructname
	math FNUMB += 1
	string NAME += "_"
	string NAME += i
	string NAME += "~"
	string NAME += FNUMB
	string NAME += "_0x"
	string NAME_CRC p= "%08x" NAME_CRC
	string NAME += NAME_CRC
endfunction
```

Please tell me what I'm doing wrong. 

1) I copied the script above and paste it in Notepad and named it Armored Core V with .bms extension. Saved in directory with dvdbnd.bdt

2) I copied func_getTYPE.bms from viewtopic.php?f=13&p=69577#p69577 and paste it in Notepad and named file func_getTYPE with .bms extension. Saved in directory with dvdbnd.bdt

3)Created a folder named Extractedbnd in directory. Opened Quickbms GUI, selected Armored Core V.bms (script), selected dvdbnd.bdt (archive), selected folder Extractedbdt as output directory

4) error in src\file.h line 178: myfopen <>
    Error no such file or directory

You should update your QuickBMS.

I can't find model container file I'm looking for.
Does anyone know how to extract the BND311G21U40 files
Mr. donkepunch
Maybe, these are only for Xbox360.
