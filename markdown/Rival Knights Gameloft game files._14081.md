- Post Title: Rival Knights Gameloft game files.

Hi masters,

I've tried to rip models from the game Rival Knights for a long time. But i cant achieve my goal. Recently, the game released as a windows store game, and i can finally reach resource files. But i can't deal with them. Tga files dont open normally and i cand fin anything for .bdae files. Is there any chance you guys can help me?

Thanks...
