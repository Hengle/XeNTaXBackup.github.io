- Post Title: XMA surround sound audio format

I tried exporting XMA audio from the Halo 3 intro music. Adjutant wouldn't export it with the header information. I was wondering if anyone had information on the header information format so I can generate a header manually. If anyone knows of a tool that can export the surround sound with the header, that would also be helpful. I'm currently trying to debug why surround sound doesn't play correctly in Xenia.

Any suggestions for debugging would be appreciated
