- Post Title: Parappa the Rapper 2 (PS2) Various Filetypes

There are these files with .int extensions and .olm extensions in Parappa the Rapper 2 that I'm guessing have models, sounds, or textures inside, but I'm not exactly sure what's in them. Any way to open them? They're pretty big (a few MB for the int, about 1 mb for the olm's) so I'm assuming there's SOMETHING inside.

(Bump) I don't think a tool exists for opening these but I might be wrong.
