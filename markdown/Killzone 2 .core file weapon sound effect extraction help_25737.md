- Post Title: Killzone 2 .core file weapon sound effect extraction help

I was hoping someone could help me with these pesky .core files. So far, after dumping the .psarc file using the extractor, I've only been able to extract character dialogue from the .core files in the named language section of "lumps." Took a shot in the dark and scanned a couple of the 1-3 KB "weapons.______" files, but only got 00:00 .mp1 files and broken .psb files. This was all using NovaSoft Extractor.
