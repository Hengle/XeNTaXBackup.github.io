You can try the other file cutter. Mine is at [http://www.watto.org/extract/download/cutter.zip](http://www.watto.org/extract/download/cutter.zip) . Mr Mouses is at (i think) [http://multiex.xentax.com/tools/cutter.exe](http://multiex.xentax.com/tools/cutter.exe) or something like that - check the link in his signature.

You could also try changing the name or extension - eg change it to archive.arc and then use the file cutter.

Just which cutter did you try? There's should not be any problem what so ever. Unless you haven't installed MexCom. 

Here's the cutter : [http://www.xentax.com/downloads/tools/filecutter.zip](http://www.xentax.com/downloads/tools/filecutter.zip)

The problem is probably that windows is trying to open the file as a directory rather than as a file. For example, when you use windows explorer, it sometimes opens *.zip files as if they were a directory, which means that it isn't always possible to select the archive to cut (as it thinks it is trying to cut a directory)

Therefore, if you change the extension to something that windows does not recognise as a directory, such as archive.arc instead of archive.zip , it should allow you to select the file in the file cutter without any problem.

Well, thats my assumption of the problem.
