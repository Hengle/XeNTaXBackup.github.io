- Post Title: Star Ocean 4 Models (Xbox360 / PS3 / PS4 / PC)

Heyo! I'm looking for the character models from Star Ocean 4: The Last Hope. (I've been trying to see if anyone has ripped them since 2009 tbh, lol.)

I've used NinjaRipper to rip models from an MMO for study before, would that method possibly work for the PC version of Star Ocean 4?
Does anyone have these models ripped in any capacity?
I'm looking for Faize in particular.

Anyone have any "Baby's first model ripping journey" information as well? I'm an artist, not a programmer, lol. I just want to study some topology.

Thanks.
