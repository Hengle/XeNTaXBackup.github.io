I know that this remake has been done using Unreal Engine, and I can read the content with the umodel viewer from gildor, however, I cannot seem to extract anything,
Sad is also that umodel does not just captures the errors and lets you continue, you need to restart the whole process :/

Anyways, anyone any luck with this?

yeah it works, but now i have every building for its own and when i open it in Blender its in the center of the Scene, somebody can create a maptool that replace the Buildings and streets to the right position, especially for san andreas??
