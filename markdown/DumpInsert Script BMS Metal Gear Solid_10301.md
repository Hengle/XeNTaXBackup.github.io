- Post Title: Dump/Insert Script BMS Metal Gear Solid

Friends come here asking for help. 

I'm with the translation of Metal Gear Solid (PSX) more or less 5 years, this game deserves a translation level because of that I'm taking with her. 

Well, I would be very possible to create a script for the BMS Quickbms. 

I'll leave the link of the file that contains the texts, but like much of a total extraction of source files, images (TIM, DDS, etc. ..) 

The Russians were doing a translation where everything could change in ISO (images and text). 

This would be possible with a BMS Script?
