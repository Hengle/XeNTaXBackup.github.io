- Post Title: We need help at fixing the 3DS Max script

Hello everyone. I'm sorry if I posted here in the wrong forum section (I'm noob in here).
The case is: our modding team works with Cryengine 3 and 3DS Max for editing models, we used a special Import script for Max, until there was a critical malfunction. We think there is something in script code, but we need smb who can check this out for us.
If anyone can help us, please, answer asap!
