Hello

Is someone able to extract .xac file ?
I know that someone posted a script here : [viewtopic.php?f=16&t=7613](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=7613)
But it seems that it's not working with those files. I don't have EmotionFX and i would open that file with another software (Blender, 3ds max or something else)

Some sample of the file's game (xac format) :

Hi
Here is another importer for models and animations from this game.
It requires Blender 249 and Python26.
Game don't use for npc and pc full head and hair meshes but textured plane like avatar.
For right position of this heads and hairs first import body.
After that import "hair" and "head" file and push play animation button. 
Go to Blender Outliner and find 'hair-mesh' or 'head-mesh' and change visibility.

For some pc heads must manual change uv map in Blender UV Editor

Sample

I'm bumping this up as trying to view the files and I've searched and googled and used every single importer I can find, but none of them work. Szkaradek123's script also just gives me error if I try to run it.

Does anyone have a working importer to view .xac files in blender?

if it's 
"ImportError: No module named newGameLib" then copy the
newGameLib folder into your blender folder (where blender.exe resides).

(If it's another problem then upload the xac in question.)

Not sure if I'm doing something wrong as there is no instructions how to use it, I tried to open the blender that comes with it and then run the script, but the code itself won't even run as it keeps complaining about missing parenthesis etc in the code on multiple lines.

You were instructed to use blender249 ("It requires Blender 249 and Python26.")
Newer versions don't work.

Hover the mouse cursor over the script (Texteditor window) then press alt-p to start the script.

Ok 1st mistake was that my blender was too new, now the script runs, but if I try to import something it still says "Python script error: check console" and console reads:

> File "SKOnline.py", line 257, in openFile
>
> parser=Parser()
>
> File "SKOnline.py", line 244, in Parser

> xacParser(filename,g)

>
> mat=matList[w[2]]

Here's one of the files, I extracted them with IPFSuite. The same thing happens with all of the files. [https://www.mediafire.com/?ja0qpf12wv980gr](https://www.mediafire.com/?ja0qpf12wv980gr)

Hi
You have error with file skonline.py which is not in importer folder. 
Please install Blender249b (32bits) and Python26.
Check if blend files open with this version of Blender. If not open, than change it in file blend properties (click right mouse button )
Double click on Blender249.blend.

(Just noticed that I typoed the DKonline to SKonline)
Jesus I'm stupid, I thought I had downloaded the zip that Szkaradek123 had made for Tree of Savior, but as you can see from the DKonline.py name it was from another thread for another game. I downloaded the zip from this thread and everything works with it!

Thanks for your help and patience!

Hi, I saw that you provided a file to open .xac of tree of savior, but your link is no longer working. I wanted to know if you can send me.

Another doubt, I would like to know which is the file of the 3D models of ToS, and how I get the animations like walking, attacking, etc.
I did a lot of research but there are several links missing and it's not my native language, please ask for your help.
you can add me on discord if you want to help me.
