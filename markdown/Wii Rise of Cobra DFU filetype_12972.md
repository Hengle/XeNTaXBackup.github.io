- Post Title: Wii Rise of Cobra DFU filetype

So I have successfully extracted everything from the Wii ISO file and it seems the largest file is titled GamePAK1.DFU which I figure this is the file that contains the models and I may have to do some further discovery work to find out how to convert them but has anyone ever dealt with a DFU type before or know how I can get past it?

EDIT: And I have tried to use OffZip, both the -a and the -z -15 commands. I get this when I try although in the output folder I have .dat, .ttt, and garbled .txt files that I can see, most are just a few kb in size. Which the QuickBMS site does have a script for the Rise of Cobra, I just don't know if it will work until I can extract from this DFU file. 
I would upload the GamePAK file so other people could take a crack at it but it's pretty large (over 900MB) and not sure where I could upload it to.
