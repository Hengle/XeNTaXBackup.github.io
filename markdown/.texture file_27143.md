Hello, this simple tool I made works with your samples (though not sure whether one of them is monochrome or not)
Try it out and let me know about problems or other encountered texture formats (you provided two 16 bit uncompressed RGB textures without transparency, and one 16 bit uncompressed monochrome? texture without transparency)

Update: fixed and re-attached tool

Indeed, the first and third image are 16-bit {b5,g6,r5}, but the second image appears to be 1272x1024 16-bits per pixel with 4 nybbles {in bit order: g4 r4 a4 b4} which must be a byte swapped ABGR.
