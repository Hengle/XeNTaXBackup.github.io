- Post Title: Grand Theft Auto V (.rpf) files

Seems like "rpf" files from GTA V PC is different than the ones found in MP3, GTA IV.

Sample link below, contains Launcher & Game exe file (probably some encryption code in here), and common.rpf file :-

```

```


Please if possible make an unpacker/dumper/repacker for it, I think its possible.

Waiting to see the possibilities !

OpenIV ([viewtopic.php?t=11538](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?t=11538) [http://openiv.com/](http://openiv.com/)) will support GTA V PC soon after release.
Pre-load version does not contain real GTA5.exe so no encryption key.
But, we were able to get some resources, like textures:

he didn't say it was impossible, he said rockstar tried its best to make it hard to mod. so expect a lot of file structure shifting, patches, etc to make modders jobs very hard

so don't laugh yet. we haven't gotten to actual modding yet, just a bunch of hex edits at this point.

not really hex editing, more a case of memory editing

Only thing im looking for is audio playback. Hope that atleast is added soon. Unless if someone knows how to decode the ADPCM files from the AWC files.

Is it true, that update.rpf has different encryption than other rpf files?

Today we are proud to release OpenIV 2.6. It took some time, but now you will be able to edit RPF Archives in PC version of GTA V. Currently we come with temporary solution, which requires ASI plugin for the game. When you are try to edit RPF Archive, you will see notification about installing plugin. You need to install an ASI loader and OpenIV plugin, otherwise your game will not work with modified archives. With installed ASI loader and plugin, you will not be able to go into GTA Online. This will keep you from accidently banning and GTA Online will be protected from modifications.

Besides RPF editing, we are also added support for GTA V PC files in Drawable, Collision and Navmesh viewers, so now you can view some models. As always, the full change log is available [here](http://openiv.com/bugs/changelog_page.php).

OK, this tool work absolutely awesome, only thing I don't seem to find is an export from the 3D models to something usefull, like obj, fbx, or anything

I know the ydr files are unreadable without the encryption key from the game, so it would make sence to have at least an export function like before right? ( export to open format)

Sorry for bump, but I found a tool for GTA V cars to convert to San Andreas...
Since I don't have GTA V, I tried it on a modded car, but there's an RPF file blocking the content.
I need to find a way to extract the RPF without the game.
