- Post Title: Crusader no Remorse/no Regret

Hello everyone!

Hopefully you can help me out!?

I've been trying to extract the files that are inside all the files with the *.flx extension - e.g. shapes.flx and gobs.flx

using multiex commander has had little success though - even though i was excited to see that crusader - no remorse is a supported game!

alot of the files wont open at all and and an error message pops up and some of them that do open are listed as 'noname1, noname2 etc' with no info about them.

yes - you can extract the sound.flx - but this is pointless - as there is a dos exe command included on the no regret cd 'crusnd.exe' that allows you to list them and convert them to wav files.

i really want to delve into all the graphic files. can anyone help out?  i have a suspicion that they may be gifs of png files - but who knows!

the video files are actually viewable on no regret - due to the required codec being included on the cd - no way of seeing the no remorse ones yet though.  any ideas on this as well?

thanks people -

Yes, indeed, support is only for a limited number of FLX files. Tere's a reason why the files are named "noname1" etc, it's because the files are saved in the FLX fils without any id. So there's nothing to do about that. 

I will see if I can recheck the original FLX files though.
