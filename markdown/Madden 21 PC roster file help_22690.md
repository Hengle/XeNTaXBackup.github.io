- Post Title: Madden 21 PC roster file help

I have been editing madden rosters since Madden 2008. This year they decided to encrypt it and im having trouble figuring it out. They are usually in DB file format. Hoping someone can help figure it out. Added a Madden 20 file for comparison. Thanks

This editor works with madden 19 and 20 files just use a hex editor to delete header to DB file then open.
