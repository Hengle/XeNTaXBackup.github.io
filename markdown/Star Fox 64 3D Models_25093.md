- Post Title: Star Fox 64 3D Models

I am trying to get models from Star Fox 64 3D, but I'm trying to figure out if its from the .gameworldbin .resourcestreambin and .resourcestreamgdb files. Even after extracting with quickbms, there are files I'm not familiar with: .dc5, .gdb, as well as .dat files. Is there anything I can do to figure out which is the model files, as well as converting them.
