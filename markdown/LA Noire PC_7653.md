Hi, I was wondering if any of you can figure out how to extract the package:

It's the smallest package I could find in the game data directory.

there are no file names just use offzip.
offzip -a -z -15 c:\file.dat c:\extract 0
you can specify the -1 option if you want it to combine the file into one

Thanks. I opened it up and inside is a series of .dat files. Do you know what to do with these?
