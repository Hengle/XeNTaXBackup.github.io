- Post Title: Open locked .sgc model

Hello,

is it somehow possible to open a locked .sgc model file (from Richard burns rallye)?

Maybe edit with a hex editor?

Thank you

Did you try the 3D Object Converter ?

Yes, I've tried it. It opens up the model, it is a bit messed up and many polygons are bad. When I save the model with another filetype and reopen the model with the software I use there is nothing.

I tested my .sgc loader module with several sample files I did find on the Net.

Unfortunately some of .sgc files don't have a parent object referenced from the subobjects. I don't know how can I move the 'flying' parts to the correct 'place' automatically.

Hey, I managed to open a locked .sgc model with the 3dobject converter, also the textures are right.

But there is stil a problem: When I save the model ex. as a Waveobject .obj file, and reopen the model with another software (3dsimed), the textures don't match themodel anymore. Why?

I don't have your modeler prg, but maybe it flips the UV datas from the .obj file.

I think you must use the Tools/Flip UV Map Vertically function (or press the CTRL+U buttons) after .sgc load (before .obj export).

I think there must be another problem. Here are two screens from what I mean. It seems the texture is not frong mapped but something other is messed up.

My Wavefront .obj/mtl exporter module works fine, you can check it out using other programs like Deep Exploration, 3D Studio Max, Maya, Softimage...

Sorry for the bump, but I am looking for a solution to this too. Is there a free way? I use blender. I don't like 3d object converter.

Did you try the Configuration/Import/Richard Burns Rally .sgc Skip the hierarchy information parameter (set to true) on your .sgc model?
