- Post Title: Lord of the rings conquest dlc

Hi guys, I am looking for the amon hen dlc for lotr conquest; I know it wasn´t released for pc and is now unavailable for purchase, but someone could have grabbed it for ps3 or xbox 360 before it got taken down, and maybe someone could dump the files onto pc, I would like to extract the files so that we can get boromir etc 3d high quality models.

I searched far and wide, couldn´t find anything, the closest thing was the first dlc files, but these don´t include new characters; the amon hen dlc was the second and last dlc for the game. I would really appreciate it.
