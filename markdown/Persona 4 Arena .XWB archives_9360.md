Used unXWB to extract the archive and got a WAV spit back out, this WAV is unplayable in everything. Any way to encode it? Here is an example:

hey i had the same problem took me all day just to find out how to do it the unxwb makes wav files but they are xma files  but this is what i did to get it to be able to play

i used unxwb, xmash and towav 

i took my xwb and extracted the files with unxwb then i dragged the .wav/xma file on to xmash to encode it then the last
step drag the new file  that was made by xmash on to towav to code it back to .wav to hear the audio from the game 

the file that was made by xmash should look something like this 0000000b.wav_RIFF_1.xma
