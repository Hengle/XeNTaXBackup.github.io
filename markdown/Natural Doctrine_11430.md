I wrote script for this game with bone+weights, but it's crappy a bit and needs to be finished. Otherwise I'll post it later as it is. Also some more samples would be great (just .scn model - no text).

Here's maxscript for Nocturnal Doctrine models, it loads meshes with bones and weights - but there's no bone-parenting. I know what I should do to achive this, but can't figure out how to implement it via maxscript  If any model will crash, let me know.
