(The faceindices are kinda blocked. Tedious task to find out where the submeshes begin/end.)

you need to decrypt the file table first.
then the quickbms script will work on it.

I'm thinking about a hex2obj version which can handle multiple submeshes better:

As a consequence for SD124A the submeshes 18, 25, 26, 31, 33 and 36 are missing - 25 and 33 because of negative counts.

[](http://www.pic-upload.de/view-26745348/DL0110.jpg.html)
 Part3: How to create and import the obj files
-------

start Make_H2O.exe and load *.MLX. 
H2O files should be created (some with errors).

In hex2obj_0.23b load the model *.MLX then choose File "SaveAs Mmesh" (multi mesh)
to create obj files from all contained submeshes.

After hex2obj processed the H2O files there should exist the same amount of obj files 
in the MLX folder named from *_0.obj to *_xx.obj

(to be honest: there will be less obj files because of some problems explained in the above post)

When executing load_multi_obj_blender2.69.py in a blender Text Editor window make sure
to have set "path_to_obj_dir" to YOUR MLX directory.

Also be sure that there are no obj files in a maybe contained subdirectory.
(they would be loaded, too)


- only 3 MLX files tested -

If you experience problems with Make_H2O 
or even a crash feel free to upload the MLX causing this.

In the DL0114*_0.H2O change the vertex count from 4801 to 3057 (as supposed by hex2obj when clicking the go1 button)
0x12240 9478
Vb1
76 40
0x2a400 3057
021000
0x0 255

Sadly there will be superfluous triangles. Dunno why.
-------------
For DL0124 try the appended H2O files.

(That's a problem caused when the last H2O contains negative counts:)

```
    ------------------------------------------------
    x     x   215  8179 17240     0 53692     0 _23: negative counts
```

Uhm, whenever I try to rip these models they seem to come out all messed up, like this. I followed the instructions you gave and tested it on a couple other models but this seems to be the result every time...

Thank chrrox and shakotay2, but all my mlx files extracted turn out to be like this, these broken models make my heart broken.
 I don't know what's wrong with my process  , could someone pack and upload all the mlx files for share please?  the pack won't be too big, just near 200MB within 7z. format  Thanks in advance!

Thank you for reminding. I tried but most models still remain incomplete. Maybe I need to try another game version, so which version is recommended for extraction, chinese or japanese version?

Two versions are the same circumstances 
The fact is that all of our team shared DLC release 
Chinese version is wordhg
Japanese version is 萌魂

> 114 back hair does not appear
found it in the second "KFMG" section:

0x20da70 1170
Vb1
76 40
0x212940 713
021000
0x0 255

Updated Make_H2O.exe. Use it with hex2obj0.23c.exe!

I didn't fully understand the counts in the tables and
did some workaround to get a maximum count of obj files.

There are three things to understand with the obj output for MLX files.
### Read carefully! ###
1. For some obj the vertex count was set/forced to max face index count
These files are saved as *.objx - since they may contain QNANs (not a number). 

You could try to create a proper obj by reducing the face index count in the belonging H2O file.
Then use "File SaveAs" in hex2obj.
2. For H2Os containing negative counts the resulting obj have zero vertices.
3. There may exist 2 (or more?) similar versions of a char contained in an MLX file.

   For the 2nd one the H2Os look like this: *_A_0.H2O, *_A_1.H2O, ...

   >>> But the obj files are numbered from 0 to lastNumber.

   In the lower left listbox in hex2obj you'll find such a line for example:

27: DL0114_SD002N.MLX_A_0.h2o

This means: the *_A_0.h2o's params were used to create *_27.obj

But more important: all obj from *_0.obj to *_26.obj belong to the first char version.

Copy them into a separate directory before using load_multi_obj_blender2.69.py

1. open DLC PKG file by PkgView
2. decrypt EDAT by TrueAncestor EDAT Rebuilder
3. decryped edat file rename .dat → .cpk
4. open cpk file by cpk.bms

is this wrong?

I tried to decrypt the .edat for the DLC and I renamed it as a cpk etc but the BMS script doesn't work on it. Plus it looks like this in HxD. I don't think this is correct... Its encrypted right? How do I decrypt the CPK?

We don't have a working sample/picture of .dat file headers, whatever.

So late readers happen to end up nowhere after searching/installing EDAT_Rebuilder, which works great.

Excuse me, could anyone upgrade the script? I hope it can load skins and motions.
As far as I know, shining resonance and Valkyria Revolution both use similar mlx file formats, and here is sample below.
