- Post Title: Is it possible to edit/modify compressed QT Resources?

Hi, I have an application that I would love to modify a Qt resource that is compiled into the executable. I used this script right here to decompress/extract the resource files, but there is no way re-reimport them, this is the script I used.

Is this possible to do with quickbms?
