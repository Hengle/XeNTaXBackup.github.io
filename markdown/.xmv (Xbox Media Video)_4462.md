Hi guys, I was trying to open these .xmv files from Chronicles of Riddick (Xbox version). I couldn't find any xmvtool or something. please tell me what should I do with these files?

Here is the sample file (I'm sorry guys, It's really hard for me to upload even a 1.33 MB file. so, I've turned it to 3 parts because of my damn dial-up connection. it's really bothering me a lot):

The xmv is a video format, based on wmv (Windows Media Video). As far as I know, just wmv-to-xmv converter exist.
And just the Xbox can use the xmv format.

This is correct, you can only go one direction and not the other, at least until someone breaks thru and makes a way to do it, which will probably never happen anytime soon.  It hasn't happened in like 5 or 6 years, so I don't think it ever will.  

If you want to preview an xmv file on the PC, the ONLY way you can do it, is to use the Cxbx emulator and the game Turok, and change the intro video to your video.  That's all that will work.  

If you want to convert the video, you can use a program like fraps or use a PVR card on your PC hooked up to the output of the Xbox.

There is a tool that can do it, but I am not allowed to post here. I will reverse it and see if I can't recreate it.

If you mean the tool in the XDK, it only goes one way, and not the way he wants, before you waste any time.

*Sigh* then you obviously don't know how to use it. I just recorded a clip from MW2. Converted it to wmv. from xmv. It has documentation for a reason.

This is EVERYTHING the tool can do.  This IS the documentation for the tool.  There are no other options.

As you can see, it does NOT convert it to wmv.  I've had the tool for many, many years. I and many others that know the Xbox 1 inside and out have never been able to make a wmv file, so do tell, what is the option (that must be hidden), to do such a feat?

Give the switch that you add on the command line to do it, or it never happened.   

It's very easy to say I obviously don't know how to use it, yet you give no proof or methods to back up your false claim.  You are using a strawman argument.  

I posted ALL the commands for the tool, in their documentation or otherwise.  Perhaps you have a magical version of the tool.  

Even using the magical goodness of Google, you will see there is no way to convert xmv back to another format.  You have to "play" the video in the Xbox emulator and record it, or capture the video directly from playing it on the Xbox and record it in another format.  Here is just one example of a thread that dies once people find out that it can't be done:  [http://fileforums.com/showthread.php?t=57854](http://fileforums.com/showthread.php?t=57854)

i only found on google this wmv to xmv converter that's all. and on other forums they all said that there isn't another chance to capture the video without a video card or the emulator...(posts from 2010)

@brien

only wanted to record the titantrons from raw2. goldberg, hogan, rock, jericho, lesnar aso...

Once again, no backup to your claims.  I asked if you meant the tool in the XDK, and you said that it was the tool you were talking about, so now tell me what extra tool that you have found in the XDK that no one else has been able to find that will do it in over 5 years.  There is no need to act like an ass about it.  

Once again, calling me names for no reason and without anything to backup your empty claims.  

As the other person has posted, the Xbox XDK has been public for many, many years now, there is no need to act all secretive.   

I suppose there is a reason why it says VIP member next to my name, yet says ultra-n00b next to yours.   

Edit:  I thought your name sounded familiar, but I hadn't been to the assemblergames Xbox and Xbox 360 sections in a long time and decided to go through the FAIL over there, but then I noticed your name there today and remembered where I had seen your username before.  This totally explains where you learned how to post BS without anything to back it up and how to backtrack on things you've posted.  I guess it's not completely your fault when you have them as an example on how to post about your "knowledge" on Xbox related info.   

Double Edit:  See, I was right.

Just a quick note regarding XMV files - very recently I found out that it is now fully supported by VLC media player.

Fully supported? I have VLC player and it errors out with a missing codec message when opening xmv files. 
Do you have a link to this codec or is there some special version of VLC that i'm not aware of? 

I could only find the source code of the xmv format:

Hmm, well maybe it was a rushed decision to call it a "full support", after all I only tested it with 3 games so far, but assumed it would be the same for the rest of them.

Using 32bit VLC - 2.0.1, no special secret version or codec.

For example here's untouched intro file from Phantom Dust. Audio + video plays fine here, which was impossible about a year ago (previous time I checked).

Ok thanks, it turns out my version wasn't the latest so i updated to 2.0.1 and it provides some support for xmv, but attempts to play [Star Wars The Clone Wars](http://www.gamespot.com/star-wars-the-clone-wars/platform/xbox/) xmv files locks up the video on the first frame, your file didn't have this problem.

Yes your file freezes up on the first frame, and that means there's only partial xwm support as of right now, so the only way to know what games it'll work with is by trial and error.

Returning to the topic, but today I day for converting videos to WMV Xbox XMV.
The formats are similar to ASF and XMV Typically contains video at 640x480 29.97, and CBR audio at 128k.
Video edited, leaving efetuei modifications with the high quality video, the size was about 3x larger than the original.

I don't know if people still care about this, but I literally created an account to post.

Years ago, I came across this version of FFmpeg that could decode .xmv so they could be played and converted to other formats. It said it worked with this specific video converter called Avanti, in its GUI variant. Don't ask me where I found them, as I have no memory of this.

Long story short, this program, when used with the right version of FFmpeg, is able to convert .xmv files into other more user-friendly formats like .avi and .mp4.

[http://www.mediafire.com/file/olyd9plmg ... UI-075.zip](http://www.mediafire.com/file/olyd9plmgfnpd8j/Avanti-GUI-075.zip)

It's ready to be used. I tried it with .xmv videos from the Dance Dance Revolution Ultramix series and it worked like a charm.
