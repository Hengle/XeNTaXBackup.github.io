So, I need a executable that converts the models to LWO, OBJ, or DAE. LWO is fine. Problem is, I cannot code, so I need someone else to make an executable. If you want to make UI, do it. Commands are fine. Where can I get the files? [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XuC-E2 ... share_link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XuC-E2UsELCt1XlHu-TVC1bmmnNvlubW/view?usp=share_link). They may be .xva or .xvm
