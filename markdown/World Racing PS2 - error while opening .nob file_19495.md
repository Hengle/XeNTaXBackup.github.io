- Post Title: World Racing PS2 - error while opening *.nob file

Hi all. 
I would like to unpack the music from the game World Racing from console PS2, because it is of better quality than the PC/Xbox version.
This is the *.nob archive and file *.fat. This is the list of files to unpack:

```
MERC.NOB
MERCB.NOB
MERCC.NOB
```

I found a topic with a script unpacking *.nob files here:
[viewtopic.php?p=32528#p32528](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?p=32528#p32528)
When I want to open a MERC.NOB file with this script, I get an error:

```
Get called with invalid datatype
Multiex 3 could not process, error: 8
```

I also insert the log from the debugger:

Please help me solve the problem of opening and unpacking archive.
Thanks in advance.

I'm sorry, but I forgot to send these files. Here's the link:

I tested files from World Racing 2 with this script and opens no problem. I was yet combining with this script, but the same errors appear.
I'm counting on your help. Thanks.
