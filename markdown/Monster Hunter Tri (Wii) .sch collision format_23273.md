- Post Title: Monster Hunter Tri (Wii) .sch collision format

Hello all,

I've been working on cracking the MH3 collision format, and despite my best efforts, all I've been able to do is locate the vertices, along with some other random non-vertex floats in the same data section. (that data shows up as a bunch of vertices along the y or x axis). I am clueless about the faces.

I would greatly appreciate help in reverse engineering this format. I don't know what constitutes as warez, so for now all I'll say is that my example file is found at 'files\15\mura\mura-a00\mura-a00-jimen-atari.sch' if the disc image is extracted with Dolphin. Here is all I know about the format.
