- Post Title: HCA2WAV

HCA2WAV - a small program to decode sounds of the format ADX2 (HCA) to wav. The decoder has been made for the reason that the format has been around for about 2 years, and decoding music from games that contain it has not been possible. Coder, unfortunately, at the moment not available, because working versions are only sold in Japan.
Decoder can download at attachment.

I will say a few words about this format.
HCA format was developed by CRI to replace its previous generation codecs - ADPCM ADX. This format is mpeg-like, ie contains a chain of algorithms: DCT transformation -> quantization -> compression coefficients. According to the spectrums of unpacked files can say that when encoding codec does not cut the high frequencies, which suggests on the weak acoustic model. On some saturated tracks that are compressed with the maximum possible bitrate (about 240 kbit/s) is clearly heard distortion. Bitrate of each frame for the entire file is constant and is given in the file header. Because all the operations from reading compressed data up to output audio pass on 128 samples, most likely the frame size is 128 samples (but for some reason can be equal and 1024, but I think the chance of this is very small). In comparison with 1152 in mp3 (potentially greater value gives better compression). Although the company is promoting this as a quick format. Well, in this case can agree with this choice, but here terrible code optimization. Bink in this aspect are better.

Nice work, you could have simply attached the tool as attachment here to save the effort to signing up to that forum to download it.
attached it anyhow for others.

Edit: deleted attachment thanks to newer version
