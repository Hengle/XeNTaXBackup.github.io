- Post Title: Pound of Ground .res files

Hi guys!!

I would like to translate this game but all files are *.res. It would be great if somebody could make an extractor o something like that. The rest of the files (music, sound, textures 2D & 3D) have the same format, so it would be useful for another purposes.

Here is the head&tail: [Link](http://hotfile.com/dl/83214276/cbe4ebc/PoGheadtail.rar.html)

Thanks a lot.

The game uses just the same format as the creators other game, named "Memento Mori".

Two great tools for packing/unpacking the *.RES files:
