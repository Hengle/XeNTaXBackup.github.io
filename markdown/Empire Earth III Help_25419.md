- Post Title: Empire Earth III Help

I have the Empire Earth III game, but it is not translated for my local language. To translate it, I opened the "dbtext.zip" file in the "C:\Empire Earth III\zips" folder in the directory where the game is installed and translated and saved the first line of the "tutorial.utf8" text file in it. . I added it to the archive and started the game. I reached the screen with the text I translated, but the text did not change.   Could you please help me how to translate?
---------------------
I found the file "DbText.bdb" in the "..ZZInstallationBDB\Release" directory, opened it with Notepad++ and changed a sentence. I double-clicked to open the game, but the game did not open.
