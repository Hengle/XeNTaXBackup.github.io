- Post Title: Terminator 2 3D MMORPG NeoX

hello fellow game breakers.

 I come to you with quiet the challenge. not just of a new game engine in general but a rather steep cost of entry that should present and interesting challenge to say the least. as in I cannot at this time access it despite the game already being out. from what I can gather this is both a pc online game but can also be played on a tablet as shown in their trailers for the game in first link.

 so the first hurtle we have to get through is getting the game which requires a chinese phone number. which I am sure the smarter of you on here can figure out a way to get and good on you. but then once we have the game files the next hurtle is to figure out just how different the NeoX game engine is.  I mean this game looks bizzare yet interesting in the fact  that it has on ground combat with arnolds temrninator and some skin walkers yet it looks like arnolds arm can be augmented much like the t2 kenner toy line of the 1990's.   the other is the sort of weird vehiclular comabt element that would be a little cooler if it used movie vehicles but beggers can't be choosers. and is it me or does that t4 harvester look more like a mech from pacific rim? anyways a link to the article and site are below if  someone knows how to get a chinese phone number off the web and can successfully download this game please share as I'd like to get to the files myself and see what's what. thank you for your time.
