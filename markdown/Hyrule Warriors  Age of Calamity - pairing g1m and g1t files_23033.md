- Post Title: Hyrule Warriors : Age of Calamity - pairing g1m and g1t files

I wanted to extract 3d models and textures from Hyrule Warriors Age of Calamity. I extracted rdb files with Cethleann tools, I have all g1m and g1t files. I was wondering how can I pair g1m and g1t files properly, so during export g1m the output dae would have proper textures applied. I have been looking at ktid files and other materials files, but I could not find any corelation between any g1m or g1t files. Can anyone teach me how can I do it? I do not want someone to do dirty work for me, I am willing to spend time on this myself, with some guidance of course
