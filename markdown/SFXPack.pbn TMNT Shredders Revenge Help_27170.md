Hi guys sorry to bother, i searched on the forum and its seems someone put a link to a bms script to extract with quickbms
SFXPack.pbn from TMNT Shredders Revenge, but link its broken, Could someone put a link of a BMS Script? (I need export and re-import so i just need a BMS Script)

Thanks a lot.

Actually the script is still available on his website (not the ZenHAX one): [https://aluigi.altervista.org/bms/merce ... gs_pbn.bms](https://aluigi.altervista.org/bms/mercenary_kings_pbn.bms)
