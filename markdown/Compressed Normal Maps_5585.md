- Post Title: Compressed Normal Maps

i was trying to use the textures from the nvidia nalu tech demo, but the normals are compressed.

I googled and couldnt find anything about compressed TGA textures, most of it was on DXT compressions for the DDS format

I did however find a blurp about CAPCOM using a trick that they would multiply the R and G channels by the alpha or other channel.. but I'm not sure that would be the case. as I tried doing that in photoshop with no luck.

maybe someone can shead some light on the normal map issue

Heres the compressed normal, taken from the nalu demo


and heres what it "should look like", taken from the Dawn demo
