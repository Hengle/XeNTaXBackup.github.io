- Post Title: [GC] Rayman 3 - *.HST Files

Hello there!

In the attachment of this topic, I added an analysis archive ( done with FileCutter ) of the rayman3.hst file in the gamecube version of Rayman 3. The real archive is larger than 500mb, and it holds all the music of the game.
You may remember that a few years ago, I posted this for the PC version ( sadly, nobody ever found out how to extract it ), but now I realized that the GameCube version has even more music, I decided to bring this file up here.

So, could you look at this archive and try to help me extract this one?

Thank you,
Droolie.
