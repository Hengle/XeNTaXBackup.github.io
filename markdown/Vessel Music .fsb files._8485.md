- Post Title: Vessel Music .fsb files.

The game Vessel has Music and sounds stored in .fsb format.
streaming_bank.fsb has the music.
effects_bank has the sfx.

Using Luigi's fsbext.exe it pulls the files but here is the kicker... they have no extension to work on, I tried to use the same technique when pulling Blade Kitten's .fsb files using the "ToWav" file by Xplorer but did not work.

I include one of the files as a sample.

Thank you for the help.

Edit:

Bumping this because it is in the sphere of my interest. Apparently, Strangeloopgames is not going to release OST. Unpacking FSB is the only way to get it.

UPD:, okay, using [Aezay's FSBextractor](http://aezay.site11.com/aezay/fsbextractor/) I managed to extract files properly, but even latest ww2ogg cannot process the extracted WAVs to OGG.

Dead end.
