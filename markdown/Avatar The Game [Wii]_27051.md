This version of game is different from the PC version.
She uses the Jade engine.
I unpacked the .bf archive using the  [sally_bf.bms](https://github.com/RetingencyPlan/le_quickbms_script_compendium/blob/master/sally_bf.bms) script
Then I unpacked the .bin files with [just_dance_bin.bms](http://aluigi.altervista.org/quickbms.htm) and got files without extension.
[Here are the sample files](https://www.mediafire.com/file/hhmf7uuiqehd4da/Puppet.zip/file)

I added the .bin extension to one file. Noesis, jadepack, bin repacker do not open it.
Persian rug open it, but does not extract the mesh, and the textures are corrupted.

Also I found in hex editor bones, if that would be helpful.
Maybe someone will want and be able to write a script to import meshes with bones and textures into Noesis or Blender.
