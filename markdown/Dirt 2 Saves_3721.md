- Post Title: Dirt 2 Saves

This save is from Dirt 2 for the Xbox 360, it uses some form of compression, I couldn't figure out what it uses though. Maybe you guys could help. I attached one of the files to this post (every saved file from this game uses this same format).

judging the repeated bytes in the middle and end of the file I bet on an encryption algorithm, maybe AES

Thanks, I'll look around in the .xex file for the key.
