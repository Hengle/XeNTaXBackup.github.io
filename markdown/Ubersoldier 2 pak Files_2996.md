Hi, i need to extract and repack some files from some archives but it looks like that these are not the usual PK files, but a variation with the header zlibbed (every 0x7735xx, i think, start a new compression block) and the rest of the file with compression 0. What do you think?

Not compressed in any way. Raw data, with specific fileheaders, the script files has a PAK header and contains normal
uncompressed ASCII.
