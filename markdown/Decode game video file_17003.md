- Post Title: Decode game video file

HI I want to make videos from the just dance vitality school(justdance.163.com) playable, the videos are downloaded to videohd folder, but these game videos are playable only in the game, on the game folders are plugins like mp4codec.dll, moviecomposer.dll that is used to decode the video files, I guess.
