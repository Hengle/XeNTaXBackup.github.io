- Post Title: Guacamelee .dat/ARCV files?

Does anyone have any idea how to extract graphics or such from these files properly? I've been doing quite a bit of searching and have found pretty much nothing on the subject. I know it utilizes vector graphics of sorts, but I have no idea how to get the files out of the resource archives.
