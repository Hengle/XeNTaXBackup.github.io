Ok, I was able to create a tool for exporting text from your samples.
Here are the source and documentation --> [https://github.com/bartlomiejduda/Tools ... te%20Night](https://github.com/bartlomiejduda/Tools/tree/master/NEW%20Tools/White%20Night)

Ok, so you can download whole repository if you want (Code > Download ZIP)

or just copy content of the file and save it as a new file on the hard drive.


As for running, google something like "how to run python 3 script",
then change paths at the end of the script and run it as you wish.

I'm not sure if I understand your question. You just have to download TXT with file format and PY file which is python script.
Here is some help [https://www.google.com/search?client=fi ... rom+github](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-d&q=how+to+download+from+github)
