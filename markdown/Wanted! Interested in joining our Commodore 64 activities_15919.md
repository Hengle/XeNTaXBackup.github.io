As you may, or may not know, XeNTaX originated in 1989 as a Commodore 64 group.

While C64 activities are currently limited, they do go on at a slow pace. 

Perhaps we can change that!?

If there are those here, that would love to start working on C64 releases, let me know, we could certainly use you!
Coders, graphicians, musicians and the like, they are all very welcome. 

Ever wanted to code in 6502 assembly?

Create demos, tools, graphics or music for the best 8-bit machine around ?

Join up, and we can think of a nice project to do
