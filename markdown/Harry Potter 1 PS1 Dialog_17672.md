- Post Title: Harry Potter 1 PS1 Dialog

Hi. I managed to extract the WAD Files from HP1 PS1. However when I try to play the WAD files is PSound Only very few of them play. I was wondering if there are any alternatives you recommend me doing to extract the dialog.

Hi.
Sorry for the necrobump, but I've been working on those WADs (Harry Potter and Croc 2 atm) for several months now.
I have written scripts and a documentation on textures, models, animations & audio.
Here's the URL of the repo : [https://github.com/OverSurge/PS1-BRender-Reverse](https://github.com/OverSurge/PS1-BRender-Reverse) ([https://github.com/OverSurge/PS1-BRender-Assets](https://github.com/OverSurge/PS1-BRender-Assets) for the extracted assets)
