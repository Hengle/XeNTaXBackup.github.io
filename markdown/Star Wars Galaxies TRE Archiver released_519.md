Hey there mouse, I have MultiEx Commander installed and the TRE Archiver doesn't work for me.  what happens to me is when I try to extract a file a new folder is created and inside is a 1kb sized file that doesn't work.  The same thing happens when I try the view feature.  Maybe I put the Archiver in the wrong place, is there a specific folder I should extract it to?

Can you post the log.txt here? It will be in the directory where you saved the TREArchiver. Also, try to create a new archive, and if that works open and extract stuff from that new tre file.

Thanks, at first sight there's not an error reported in the log. 
Hmm. 

With create , I mean create a new TRE archive with the TRE Archiver. 
Select NEW from the file menu, then select the new name of the TRE file, and then select multiple files to include. Finally click OK to create the archive. If that works, then try to open the new file and extract stuff from it.

I created a couple tre's with a different file in each and they extracted fine.  Although renamed they worked fine.

Ah, now we're getting somewhere!   I suspect there's something wrong with the process whenever there are files in there that are NOT compressed. I will try to figure this out when I have time. Thanks, and be sure to have a subscription to this thread, because if i figured that out or have additional comments I will post it here.

Okay, it should work now.

I have replaced the zip file, just scroll up and download the new version (0.7.16). This should fix the issue with the non-compressed files. plus, it give you the choice to compress/don't compress when crating your own new TRE archives. 

The updated source code can be found here:

I can't get it to start now:
Run-time error '9':
Subscript out of range

Then when the program opens none of the buttons do anything.

I would also be interested in a reader for all the *.iff files. I can read some of the stuff in a text editor but most of it is weird stuff. I not enough smart to crack it by self thow. (Bad grammer added for emfasis)

Just like to say first, thanks for the excellent program.  Been trying to do this for a while myself, but was pointed here ... excellent work.

Also, if your trying to get the .snd files to work, your player will probably say that it should be .au format.  However, this is not really the case.

After spending a few hours extracting all the TRE files so I could look around for kicks, I found that a majority of the files in the game are actually call files.  If you open a .snd file (or any other less than 1k size file) you'll find that it is actually a coded pointer to another file in a totally separate directory.

It's really wild how they have done the client.  There is so much calling of other files to do one thing it is insane.

Ok, interesting. So... what do you do with the snd files? What do you use to view the other files too, just notepad or similar?

I wouldlike to translate the game into hungarian and i found the text files.

They are in *.STF format.
Does somebody know, what software can edit these files?

It says it is a Microsoft Office file, but office does not recognize it.
I can open them with excel, but this is not the right software for sure.

Notepad opens it as well and it looks better, than in excel, but also not the right one.

Does somebody know, what could i do?

I cant add directories to the new file!

If i extract a TRE file, it makes me many directories.
How can i convert them again to a tre file?

You can't. 

It's a tool that was created to test the TRE extraction method, without any warranty or support. 

I have released the source code for anyone who wants to improve it (there's a lot of room for improvement, as you might have guessed). 

I did not intend to work on it more than I did. It's up to other programmers to create a better tool.

1. No
2. I don't know if you have the original game, but if not than this question of yours is all about playing the game without actually buying it, which is illegal, as you very well know. Such questions are not allowed here.

Ok, well, assuming you have the original, please contact the producers of SWG to register it. They will surely help you further at no charge! Just send them an email, include the registrationcode of your copy of SWG and I'm positive they will help you out so you can play again.

I advise you to press harder at the company as it is the only feasible way. Meanwhile, there's very little chance that any information regarding registrationcodes is in a TRE file, let alone code that can be hacked to give you access without the correct code.

Take notice of the "very little chance". That also means I will not spend time on it. Figure out why not.

While you may be correct, I will not spend time on it to see if I have the knowledge or not. Because that's not the issue. The issue here is : 

1. I don't want to help you play a game without you paying for it, because it "is evident that you haven't the registrationcode to do this". 
2. I never help people that come here and *demand* something from me. They forget that the work done here, by me and others, is done without getting payed. "Demanding" something from us is therefore a foolish undertaking.

What an idiot...

If you really have the key and it is in use, SOE actually replace it!
You have to contact the CSRs in the support chat and they give you an email adress to send your request.

I dont know exactly which email adress it is, but i know, they can deactivate your current key and give you a new one!

Hacking and cracking is never the right way to get your game running!

Second I would like to ask a question:
     Is your tool compatible with the current publish of SWG?

1. Greetings. 
2. I wouldn't know. You can simply try it.

Wish I could.       I used to play the game at a local LAN center but it closed down a couple months ago.  The PC I currently own can barely support Half-Life and Diablo 2.  Pretty sad if you ask me.  SWG won't even install itself on my PC because it knows it's worthless.

Man I wish there was a way to read the files a lot easier. I've been looking around for something to help with iff and stf files. I've found that iff files are some kind of standard game interchange file format, but I've found nothing to open and read them decently. The std files can be read, but there's a odd character between nearly every other character. Bugs the eyes out after a while.

I'm not going to be a dick like the last guy and demand you program something and be quick about it.  But I was wondering if you had any expericance with a reader for these kind of files, more maybe a hint or nugde in the right direction. I'd be happy to email you one of the files if you would want to take a look at it.

Not hacking or cracking, just looking.

hello,
on the first page there was a guy who had a problem where all his extracted files were 1kb and didn't work.
Well, this is happening to me, and I didn't quite understand the solution to the problem.
Could ye help?
Thx!

Yes, as Wright said. 

Please specify the problem some more, AND post the log if the 0.7.16 version still gives you problems. Also, there's a nice Troubleshooting forum for this kind of thing

Hey Mr Mouse! I was wondering if you could take a look at .stf files contained inside the .tre files. These files hold info ranging from skill trees to NPC conversation strings.

The basically Each string should correspond with a name for that string. Exemple:
name                                string
science_medic_novice        A Novice Medic can use blah blah...

This format doesn't look too complicated but i am still quite new to programming, and i lost my copy of VB recently so i can't attempt anything with that, and C++ isn't the best language for file I/O... anyways, could you take a look at those files? The ideal output would be an HTML file wich would simply be a table.

If you need samples of these files send me a mail at [imperio59@wanadoo.fr](mailto:imperio59@wanadoo.fr) , i'll send you a couple!

science_medic_novice        A Novice Medic can use blah blah...

Each .stf is made up of 2 parts, the text description and SWG's internal name.  Each part is linked by a number, so you have:

number name
586 science_something 

number description 
586 Blah blah blah blah blah

You can then link the two based on that number.

As for the format of the file..  there seems to be a 13 byte header (unsure what it tells us), then the first part of the file (descriptions) seems to be 12 bytes (which includes the ID number), then the string follows (null terminated).  It then swaps over to a different format for the internal names, which seems to be 4 bytes for the ID,  4 bytes for the string length, followed by the string (not null terminated).

The oddest thing is the descriptions part - each char of the description seems to be held in 2 bytes, so looking at file strings you see weird things like "N o v i c e   E n t e r t a i n e r".. 

Oh and there are quite a lot of .stf files, but most seem to come as 3 different categories - _n.stf for names, _d.stf for descriptions, _t.stf for titles (e.g. skl_n.stf = skill names, skl_d.stf = skill descriptions, skl_t.stf = skill titles).

I'd love to know where they make up these stupid formats from, i've never seen anything like this before.

Just an edit to this since I've just found out what the header does.  Of the header's 13 bytes, the last 4 bytes indicate the amount of entries there are in this file (allowing you to setup a loop for each section). 

Also the first part (the textual descriptions), the string isn't null terminated, I just misread the 0 for being the last byte of each two byte character string.

I have a problem. I've installed MultiEx and everything, nice prog btw, but the SWG one wont seem to start properly! Whenever I launch it, it shows me this error "Run time error '9': Subscript out of range". After that it loads the GUI, but no buttons work (I can press them, but no menu's comes.)   

I'm on winxp home.

Unzip ALL files into the same directory and start again. 
It needs to show the eul.txt before you may use the program!

Wright, IFF files originated on the amiga in the mid 80's.
As you correctly pointed out, IFF stands for interchange file format. 
The "interchange" part means that an IFF file can contain almost any
type of data, but the most common use of IFF files is for images and sounds.

The format is quite old, but was open enough that it is still in use today (Maya uses IFF files).
The most common types of IFF files were ILBM and 8SVX. ILBM stands for Interlaced Bitmap, IIRC, and those contain graphics.
8SVX stands for 8 bit Sample with Volume Control (kinda) and those contain sound files.
To find out whether your iff files are sounds or graphics, open them up in a hex editor.
At the top of the file you will see "FORM" in the ascii display. Following that, you will find ILBM if it is an image or 8SVX if it is a sound.

For more info on the IFF format, check out the IFF Form and Chunk registry here: [http://www.users.bigpond.com/james.jacobs/reg/iff.html](http://www.users.bigpond.com/james.jacobs/reg/iff.html)

As for opening the files, I know Photoshop and PSP both support IFF images, and Soundforge and possibly Cooledit support IFF sounds.

Alright whenever I try to replace a file if I use the options:

Run and start I get a runtime error 

also if I use add I dont think it adds it because once I view it the values are the same even though what I replaced it with had dif values...

point out what I am doing horribly wrong or any help would be greatly appreacited

"Add to list" will only add a file to a list that will be used if you do "Add and start" to replace files. So yes, it won't add it realtime. You will have to do a "Add and start".

If you get a run-time error, please specify WHICH error you get, "run-time error" is just way too vague. 

The TRE Archiver was not designed to work with exceptionally huge TRE files, nor has it been updated ever since the latest version was released. If new TRE formats have arisen as used by the game, then the Archiver will in all probability no longer function correctly. 

I just created a new small TRE file, and replaced two files in there succesfully. That at least should also work at your computer.

Alright the exact error is a run-time error '9': subscript out of range

And it was while using a very large .tre file the program then closes itself.

However it still works fine after to my knowledge. I havent tried a smaller file yet mostly just been fooling around with it 

If you are interested here is a program that is very neat similar in way to yours this is able to view whats actaully inside the .tre files as yours but goes into more depth you can even save them well here is the link not sure if you had heard of it before very cool

doesnt have the ability to edit them like yours however at least to my knowledge

I am getting a "Run-time error '429': ActiveX component cannt create object" when I run the program, it then starts but nothing works (even manual will not open).  I installed commander and rebooted system and still the same thing.  Perhaps an error with SP2?

It sounds like not all the files were extracted in the dir. This problem was reported before. Try unzipping all files in the directory. You will need the eul.txt file as well.

They are all in the directory, even re-downloaded them and re-extracted them to make sure.

Active X error stops all of the buttons from working when the program runs...and I never saw a eul pop up for agreement just the error message.

any thoughts?  would love to check this thing out.
thanks.

You are prolly trying to execute the file from inside your /zip archiver.  drag the files out to a new folder on your desktop and then try to run the .exe file.  It should now work properly.

Have you been able to get this program to work?  I see the link is fine, but downloading and unzipping the program results in an unhandled error and premature termination.  Anyone have any ideas?

I am interested in viewing and saving specific information from inside the .TRE files for SWG.  Perhaps someone knows how to make this program work?

Any chance of getting this updated.  The archiver wont recognize any .tre fill post patch 17.  That was when RotW came about a year ago.

All patches from 17 and before came with client, shared, sku, and sku2 flavers.... ie patch_17_client_00.tre , patch_17_shared_00.tree, patch_skul_17_00.tre, patch_sku2_17_00.tre.  There was also the Patch_17_00.tre that was the one readable by tre archiver.

Since then every patch has come in the following flavor (patch 18 used for reference)

patch_18_client_00.tre
patch_18_shared_00.tre
patch_sku1_18_client.tre

with no patch_18_00.tre.

There have also been some that went to sku2 and sku3.

Could it be that patch 17 and before compiled the related tre into one complete tree... patch_17_00.tre and that now they arent being compiled?  What would you need from me to work out the details?

The reason im so interested is that SWG is drastically changing the game, even added movie sequences and voice tallent among changing combat and other aspects of the game.  Im very interested in poking my nose around to see what other goodies they have added

Lets say I was to phony up the $6 for MultiEx, will the development of TRE Archiver be included in that $6 fee? 

Seems I have to have full version of MultiEx to use adv features in TRE Archiver

Update: Guess what I'd really like to know is if I pay the $6 will the development of TRE Archiver continue? I would like to see what files the registered verion of MultiEx enables TRE Archiver to view and edit.

SWGExplorer already allows viewing/saving/exporting of image files (DDS/TGA) and creates tables of various data formats + allows you to save/export the table as HTML

Would love to see:
- Complete files support: exp: Color codes for tags allowing easy editing .inc/iff files
- A Search tool would be very important too
- File information Tool - Exp: When loading a DDS file into photoshop using nvidia's plugin it does not tell me whats settings it was saved with, thus making it difficault to save back into a version of DDS that works with SWG. If I could tell all that from/via TRE Archiver it would be easier to save back into a compatible format
- A Mesh viewer would be kick ass
- Shader editor would rock my socks

Tnx

TRE has been developed already and time and work has been spend on it. The donation is what it is : a donation. The MultiEx key is a return favor.

There are numerous threads on the TRE Archiver. You should find all info there. What it does is extract stuff from TRE files (referred to by TOC files yes or no). Please read all that's already written about the archiver. Thanks.

If SWGExplorer is what you prefer, why not use that then?
