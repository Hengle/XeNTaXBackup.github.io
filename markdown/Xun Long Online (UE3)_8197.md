Looks good, also trying to download a client, will see what is inside.

Yes, when trying to find some more info about it also find this info "ZYGame is a Chinese inland game professional developer and producer, which is famous for Quan Qiu Shi Ming ("the global ops"), a UE3-based TPS with various interesting combat modes" so here is one more to try

Just to throw this into discussion:
The newer games that are using the Unreal Engine (>2.5 (and modified)), have file archives like *.umd and *.u, which are zlib-compressed. The data inside is serialized. Till UE 2.5 the archives were just like the older ones, with slightly differences.

EDIT://
For the old format (till UE 2.0) look at the xentax-wiki
