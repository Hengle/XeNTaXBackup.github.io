- Post Title: Dante´s inferno PS3 importer script please

someone can create a importer script for any program? (3ds max , noesis , etc)

Long time ago, some people in this forum have created scripts for this models, but this has never published.

I found the way for convert textures, now I need the models, the format is similar to dead space models.
