This key can decrypt games using the 7.x crypto, aka latests ones like Super smash, etc...

Oh, interesting stuff.

On the 3ds front I'm quietly hoping people are going to start releasing the XORPADs for various games for those of us who own the games but don't have an old 3DS (and don't fancy putting down Â£100 for a new one).

The pads themselves are useless if people don't have the game. So it doesn't encourage piracy or anything IMHO.

Well, I'm not against it, tho don't count on me; got a really shitty connection atm so can't really upload like 50gb of XORPAds x)

Oh wow, I was just thinking outloud.

I'm only after a few particular titles anyway though.

Fantasy Life (Japanese or European, I own both), same with Bravely Default, Pokemon X I only have the Euro version of though, and then finally Attack of the Friday Monsters, which is an eshop game.

Anyone who'd be willing to do that, I'd be more than happy to share the files created using the decrypter, all it takes after that is someone to make a XOrPAD from that I believe.
