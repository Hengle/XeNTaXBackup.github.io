Here is a bms to extract the data.cpk file from this game.
I cant decompress the cpk's on the fly quickbms errors out on some files.
So I just name them .cpk files for extraction with other tools.

I don't quite get this set up, I've extracted the data.cpk, but what is the other method to extract decompressed CPK inside?

even after extracting the cpk's the models have thier headers encrypted to prevent loading in noesis.
You will have to manually convert any model you want.

Do you plan to encrypt the files? or how to encrypt those inside of the .cpk?

Looks like some progress has been made on the ASB model front.

I'm messaging the individual who posted these screens to see if they wouldn't be willing to share some methods.
