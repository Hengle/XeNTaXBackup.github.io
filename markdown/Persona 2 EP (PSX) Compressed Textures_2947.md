- Post Title: Persona 2: EP (PSX) Compressed Textures

Contrary to Persona 1, Persona 2: Eternal Punishment uses a compression rather than a rare spritesheet format. If I'm not mistaken this contains compressed/encrypted textures or sprites. I'm not 100% sure but looking at this I see data that resembles palette and then a compressed graphic. The only problem is that it seems native or at least rare thus there is nothing out there on it.

Hopefully these ARE textures, certainly are not sounds as P2 uses a more standard audio format.

Highly unlikely this contains any sort of graphics.

There is a lot of ASCII in it though!

I think yer looking at the wrong place!

How unusual. O_o Well I know by looking through the files in Texture Finder there is no uncompressed images. Sprites and such are compressed SOMEWHERE, so I'll look again.

This looks like a caption file for me.
