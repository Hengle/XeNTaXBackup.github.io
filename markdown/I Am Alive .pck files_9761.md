- Post Title: I Am Alive .pck files?

I would like some of the audio from the XBLA port "I Am Alive". The game runs on the Splinter Cell: Conviction engine, a modified version of UE3. I'd like to know if there are any scripts capable of decompiling a .pck file? The sizes range from 60 MB to 200 - I'm guessing it's a package file.

I did a game rip of I Am Alive a while back if you'd like it, but if I remember correctly I used VGM Toolbox from HCS to extract the music files.

And sure I'd like the game rip.
