- Post Title: MKV files problems

I have some problems with mkv files on my Android phone. The file runs fine in Utorrent built-in player, but with no audio. So, I installed a few of apps to play mkv files, but every app has the same problem. The audio works, but video stops and "flash". Every scene becomes very very bright and stutters.

The video can simply be either corrupt the way it was downloaded or it needs a re-mux on a PC using MKVToolnix, if that doesn't fix your issue, re-download or look for another source file.
