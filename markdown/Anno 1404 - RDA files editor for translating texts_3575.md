Thank you, Rheini.
But how can I repack extracted files?

No need to.
The game runs fine with extracted files (in fact there already exist some extracted files in the data folder by default)

I extracted eng0.rda with your program, then translated some texts.
But the game doesn't use extracted files instead of eng0.rda file.
If I delete eng0.rda, it will use the next language file, for example ita0.rda or french0.rda...

I don't exactly know how the game handles that, i.e. when it uses the extracted files.
Maybe you got to move or rename (or delete if you want) all of the language stuff and only provide your files.

I deleted the all of language file (eng, ita, esp, fra) from directory.
When I lunched the game it was empty, there was no text in it.
In extracted folder there is a 'localisation.xml' file. See attachment.
I don't know, what should I do. Any idea?

So there probably is a file containg all language files,
At least I've already seen text files containing a collection of other file paths.

After I extracted 'eng0.rda' into 'data' folder, I have had to rename the original 'eng0.rda' to 'eng1.rda'. 
Now, the translation appears in the game.

Hello!
I have a new problem with extracted Anno 1404 files.
I translated text files and they work with the game, but now I realised that: 
the "game modding, achievements deactivated" message is not good. I can't gain medals and gems and achievements.
How can I repack text files again into an RDA? It's very important.
Thanks.

There is no repacker. Maybe someone will write one with my source code provided there: [http://www.annozone.de/forum/thread.php?threadid=10541](http://www.annozone.de/forum/thread.php?threadid=10541)

I won't do it since I'm not interested in this game anymore.

Does anyone know how I can reach the translators of the site GameVicio? I would like to contact with translators of the Anno 1404.
I think that they created a packer for the game.

Thanks.

Really? So why don't you just register at their site and write a forum post or whatever?
If they really have a packer please let me know. The German community also desperately longs for one.

I registered but I have to wait 1 week after registering to write a post. And I didn't find any other email address.
I downloaded their translation (this only works with game v.1.0): four .RDA files! 
(eng1.rda, esp.rda and so on)

I managed to contact with their programmer.
Although his program can compile, but can not compress files.
I hope that he will manage to find a good solution.

The compression is plain zlib, where's the problem?
Is he willing to share his source code or at least the tool itself?

Something is happening on the website AnnoZone.
Did you read this topic: "1404Explorer Quelltext"?

Sorry, I forgot that you're Hoenir too.
This is a very good news!
Will the packer be public?

He hasn't released anything yet but I'm pretty sure he will do so soon.
