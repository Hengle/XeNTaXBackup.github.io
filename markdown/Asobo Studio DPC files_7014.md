Hi, I need help with one archive type. It is from "CT Special Forces - Fire For Effect" game.


 FONTS.rar
(95.68 KiB) Downloaded 24 times



It seems to be similar like Fuel archives (different version) [viewtopic.php?f=10&t=3569](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=3569)
I need extract data chuncks from archive and then help with identify of extracted graphics data (fonts in this case).

Thanx for any help.
