- Post Title: Spore .Package Format(Not the same as Sims 2)

I was looking in The Spore Data Directories, and I found several .package files(basically all there is in those folders) that hold major game contents.
I was wondering if someone could convert those to the Sims 2 Format, or make them openable in SimPE or make a new editor.

Here is one

And i think the data is compressed with refpack, used in command and conquer tiberum wars

It doesn't seem compressed, as I can change strings in game with a hex editor and have them work fine.

But the files DON'T Open in SimPE, and they have the DBPF Header(like a Sims 2 Package File).

Are the Sims 2 ones compressed with refpack?
If so, could I just compress a Spore file, and then it would work?

I don't get this at all.

1. That is for Creature Creator, I have the Full Spore game. I want custom planets/stages/tools/terraforming stuff/badges/galaxies/creature parts/stargate mod
2. Models are useless for me.


I guess I'll PM the author of that on the Ogre Forums to see if he knows the format.
