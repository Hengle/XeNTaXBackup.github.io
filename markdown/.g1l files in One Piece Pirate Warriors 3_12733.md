Hey there, I've already looked up the extensive stuff done on .g1l files thus far, but have hit a roadbump. I used the generic Quickbms script but from a 180 meg file it only spat out 2 at3 files. Surely this isn't right? And nearly 200mbs of music can't just not be there.

If anyone would like to help, that'd be great. I can upload or pm sample files too.
