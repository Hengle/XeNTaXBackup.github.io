- Post Title: Zelda Totk .bwav audio files

Hi.

For some reason, about 10% of the files .bwav files in the new Zelda game can't be opened with Foobar... I've a uploaded one such file here [https://www.dropbox.com/s/gcd575qj265mo ... .bwav?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/gcd575qj265morz/Dm_OP_0020.bwav?dl=0)

Like I said, it's marked as a .bwav file, which Foobar can play about 90% of the files, but there's some like this one, which Foobar can't play and if you guys can have a look that'd be great.

Thanks

have you tried bars.zs files, which can be extracted into .bars files with zstd which are the actual containers?

Or more information found here:
