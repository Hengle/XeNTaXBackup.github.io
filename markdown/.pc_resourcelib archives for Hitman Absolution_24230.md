- Post Title: ".pc_resourcelib" archives for "Hitman: Absolution"

Hi all, does anyone know if its possible to extract/view files from/within these archives? I'm looking to determine whether or not localised audio tracks are given their own series of ".pc_resourcelib" container files, and if so which ".pc_resourcelib" archives contain a given localisation.

Thanks for this, I had a look at the former topic but I don't have any knowledge with scripting for this use-case, and am unable to adapt this script to extract all files rather than just the specified audio files. Looking at results from the latter link, it seems users have developed tools to extract models, however attempting to follow the given steps/procedures with files from either the GOG remaster or current Steam build, results in a "missing headers" error that seems to have been recorded [as far back as 2018](https://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=15883&start=60#p142784). 


Given the age of the tools & relevant posts, it seems the modding, and research scene for this title has gone dark. Thanks for pitching in and offering these resources to read over, however it would seem that this is where my research journey ends, given my lack of knowledge regarding the archives with the "BILR" signature, and the lack of interest towards this title.
