this Game is can't decrypt by use UModel after 2014, so i use the custom header fix tool by my friend, but it have some fatal error.
the legendary package editor can rightly to read the file tree, but the skel mesh and texture content can't read and export.
I will provide the original file , uncompressed file by use AFUpkExtractor.exe, the decompressed original file with fix header. 
I hope to someone can help me to fix these files that can't export skel mesh and animation.
