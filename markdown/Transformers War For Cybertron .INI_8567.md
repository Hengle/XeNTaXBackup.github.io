- Post Title: Transformers War For Cybertron .INI

There use to be a programmed called TWfC_util that could decrypt and re-encrypt the .ini files but the program seems to have disappeared. I Googled it and either the links are dead or no one seems to have it anymore.

If someone who has it could share it that would be appreciated or know of any other programs to decrypt it.

The Coalesced.ini file
