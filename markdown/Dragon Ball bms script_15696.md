- Post Title: Dragon Ball bms script?

Hello! I'm trying to extract the characters and the maps from Dragon Ball Budokai Tenkaichi 3 (Ps2 version), but i didn't have much luck.
I've extracted the files from the .afs file, but now i don't know what to do. Do i need a bms script, or what should i do next?
I would be thankful if somebody could help me.
