- Post Title: Usm with subtitles

I know than usm can be extracted with VGMtool and then appear a m2v and a adx file. But i opened a Usm with HxD and this thing says than inside the usm its a avi a wav and a txt. Someone know how i extract them? VGMTool dont extract only convert video and audio to that files than i said before but i prefer the avi and the wav and i really need the txt if someone know how do it.
thanks.
