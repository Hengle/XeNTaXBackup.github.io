- Post Title: Help with FF12 Models especially Bangaa Models

I'm looking to acquire or convert the models from Final Fantasy 12 to use in MikuMikuDance.
Details on where I am with my RAW files and model converting are in my other thread here: [viewtopic.php?f=18&t=5018&p=42562](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=18&t=5018&p=42562).

If anyone has these models or any tips on how I can convert or obtain them myself (as distribution is technically a no-no) please post! 

Any feedback at all will be GREATLY appreciated!
