- Post Title: other people in the game

I know very little about modding and I want to know if the following problem it's worth the effort: In a PC game I'm playing, some humans have different animations than others regarding their interaction with some objects. They interact with only some objects while doing nothing with the rest. What I want is to change those animations with those of the other people in the game, so after that they could interact with ALL objects!
