- Post Title: Iphone/Ipod touch APP PNGS

Hello fine folks and friends. I've recently been playing a rather addicting game on my friends Ipod Touch. I wanted to make a short comic featuring the characters and enemies from the game and have gone through the process of extracting the file data of the game. Fortunately the images are all PNGS. UNfortunately, they are unable to display in normal format. I was hoping someone here could whip up a quick bms script or some such simple solution so I can get the images I need.

Following the link here will net you a zip file containing a few samples of the PNGs in the game file system.

Let me know if anyone can help!

That site seems to be flawed. Is there a program. I already have Fixpngwin, and it fails to decode half the images. I was interested in the pngs too.

I have that same program and ran into a similar problem with these:

Can someone 'normalize' these for me?

I tried those files on ALL of my converters. They only succeed in decoding half the image it seems. Does anyone else know how to decode them fully?

You can use [http://www.poop.nl/files/iphone-fixpng.tgz](http://www.poop.nl/files/iphone-fixpng.tgz) to convert them back to normal PNGs.

I've tried that one before, but it, along with other converters, seem to be only able to decode small images.
Here is an example.

Yes, we've tried that program as well. We need someone to fiddle around with maybe the python script to make it limitless.

hmm, "not a valid Win32 app"

Maybe this is the reason?

> applications built with Visual Studio 2012â€™s C++ compiler will fail to load and execute on Windows XP

But maybe CheloXL used C sharp; so I don't know...
