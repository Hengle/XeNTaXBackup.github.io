- Post Title: Jane Nash from 3DMark Vantage

Hello to all 3D models fans!
I need your help - only yesterday I found BMS script which unpacking 3DMark .dat files. And (finally!) I've got Jane Nash 3D model with textures! But! This model is in unknown (for me) format  If somebody could look at this model and tell me how to convert it into normal (dae or fbx or max) format, I'll be very happy and thankful!
Here is it: [http://www.mediafire.com/file/b9lbhb3hd ... e+Nash.rar](http://www.mediafire.com/file/b9lbhb3hd53bq5n/Jane+Nash.rar)
P.S: I'm really counting on you 'cause there is no 3D ripper program working with DX10...
