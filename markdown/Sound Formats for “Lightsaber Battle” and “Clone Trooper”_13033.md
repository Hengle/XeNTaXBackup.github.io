- Post Title: Sound Formats for “Lightsaber Battle” and “Clone Trooper”

I’m curious to know if anybody has attempted to analyze or decipher the file format for these games:

It’s probably unheard of to attempt to do such a thing for plug-and-play games, but I like the swinging sounds of the lightsabers as well as the very, very rare stormtrooper blaster sound that most would love to have in their sound library. I’m not sure if this is the right place to put this topic in, or if it is even possible to do what I had said above, but I’d like to hear what you have to say about it.

I don't know myself, but I swear that exact blaster sound was in dark forces 2 (quake 3 engine fps/tps)

edit: or maybe i'm thinking of jedi knight 2

Actually, one of the sounds was in Dark Forces II: Jedi Knight, but the sound I want is right here: [https://youtu.be/cGnMYyBskFc?t=3m7s](https://youtu.be/cGnMYyBskFc?t=3m7s).

Oh THAT one.  I hear that one everywhere. kinda annoying that when the game devs get the sounds from lucas, they ALWAYS modify a few, including that one. I've heard it in the movies, but in the games, they always layer it with other things, to be clear, it's this one right? (listen for the solo sound after the end of the flurry) [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlLpV2Ge_LY&t=20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlLpV2Ge_LY&t=20)

I've yet to find that in high quality myself. it does seem like they ran slinky's through a few filters, but I've never quite achieved the same punch they get.

googling i've only dug up the following info:
cpu is Generalplus GPAC800
memory in that system is split, 64 MB NAND, 32 MB SDRAM 

(I'd wager sounds are stored in the NAND portion, as for format, probably something compressed)
