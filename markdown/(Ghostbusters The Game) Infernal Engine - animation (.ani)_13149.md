- Post Title: (Ghostbusters: The Game) Infernal Engine - animation (.ani)

Hello everyone! I apologize in advance for my bad English! I understand the resources of two games made for Infernal Engine by Terminal Reality: Ghostbusters: The Videogame and The Walking Deadâ„¢: Survival Instinct. In both cases, there are files a character animation, action, and so on with the .ani extension. Dear forum, help me, please, to edit these files. First, there is a lot of text encoding, and then go line bone_R (or L) _xxx. Please help me in these files. Thanking you in advance.
