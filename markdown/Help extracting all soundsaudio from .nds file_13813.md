- Post Title: Help extracting all sounds/audio from .nds file

I need help with extracting all sounds from a .nds file.

The file I need all the sounds from is here:
[http://www.emuparadise.me/Nintendo_DS_R ... 7-download](http://www.emuparadise.me/Nintendo_DS_ROMs/Star_Wars_-_The_Clone_Wars_-_Republic_Heroes_%28EU%29%28M5%29%28BAHAMUT%29/50327-download)

It is for the Nintendo DS EU version of Star Wars The Clone Wars Republic Heroes.

I really need all available character voices and sounds. Any help would be greatful. Thanks!
