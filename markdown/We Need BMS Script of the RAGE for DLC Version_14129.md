- Post Title: We Need BMS Script of the RAGE for DLC Version

Hi there. First of all, I'm so happy for join Xentax forums.

We have trouble with RAGE .resources files. I know there is a BMS script for extract the .resources files. But these BMS script only for main game. We need a BMS script that supporting the DLC version of the game.
