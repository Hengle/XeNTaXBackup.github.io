- Post Title: [PC] Crossout (grp, pk2)

Hi

Crossout game change archives from pak to grp and pk2. I would like to ask if it is still possible to open those archives, and if so how?

Samples (92040 build):
models.grp (96 MB) [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QH93qK ... TxKtjoSQjk](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QH93qKHTqgKbeGCdWoygcJTxKtjoSQjk)
ui.pk2 (34 MB) [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hM8NVU ... tWMHngFeRW](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hM8NVUyoSwnaLfx6DCfr6rtWMHngFeRW)

Samples created in MMFC:
models.grp.zip (2 MB) [https://drive.google.com/open?id=1AP4MG ... 7RKKmkb3j9](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1AP4MGJ9yIq8-w-qXJs_Wpc7RKKmkb3j9)
ui.pk2.zip (2 MB) [https://drive.google.com/open?id=1ZeJNF ... 7E69xu6l_g](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1ZeJNFsuOA7mQU77tirhzhN7E69xu6l_g)

Last working BMS script if it will help in some way (91638 build):

2 years later, I too would like to decode the assets. Have you found any way to do so? I'd love to hear it.
