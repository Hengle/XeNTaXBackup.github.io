- Post Title: Valkyria Chronicles 2 files managment

Hello, my name is Vasiliy, i am from Russia. I am really like valkyria chronicles series, so i want to translate untransleted games on russian: VC2 and VC3. I tryed to unpack ODIN.CPK of VC2, but only found a lot of files, that encrypted. I also tryed to find any information about this files, but only found about MLX files, that contain models and it not what i need. Does anyone know where is places script, font, texture files and does anyone know how to decrypte them? I will be very gratefull.
