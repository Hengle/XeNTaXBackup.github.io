Probably the best place to look is [http://forums.bethsoft.com/topic/148761 ... available/](http://forums.bethsoft.com/topic/1487612-libess-22-now-available/) and the associated download. Its code I wrote a while back that parses as much of the Oblivion data stuff as I was able to figure out at the time. (and is probably the most comprehensive reference on the format since from memory I figured out stuff no-one had yet figured out)

Other useful links are:
[http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Tes4Mod:Save_File_Format](http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Tes4Mod:Save_File_Format)
[http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Tes4Mod:Mod_File_Format](http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Tes4Mod:Mod_File_Format)

There is other info out there about the Oblivion data formats but this is a good place to start.
