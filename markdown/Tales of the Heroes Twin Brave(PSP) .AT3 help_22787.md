- Post Title: Tales of the Heroes Twin Brave(PSP) .AT3 help

I've been adamantly trying to get access to the music files in the game. So far I've used Namco BDI Tool to extract a few thousand .at3 files,
I'm trying to play them with vgmstream but they don't work, I need to know what's wrong with this these AT3 files I extracted.



Thanks in advance.

Don't know what is wrong with them, but I had decode errors when attempting to play them [https://imgur.com/a/BcOiJH8](https://imgur.com/a/BcOiJH8)
Also, converting didn't work and resulted in 0Kb files.

I was using player from AT3 converter [https://www.psx-place.com/resources/at9 ... erter.566/](https://www.psx-place.com/resources/at9-at3-converter.566/)

No, sorry. These files seems to be corrupted. Or they just don't match AT3 file format specification.
