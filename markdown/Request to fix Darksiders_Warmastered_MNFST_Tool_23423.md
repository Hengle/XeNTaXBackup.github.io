Hello guys,

1. I'm translating Darksiders Warmastered Edition and used Darksiders_Warmastered_MNFST_Tool by Delutto to import the new text file I translated to pc.mnfst and when I run the game and choose the language I edited I get this error message


when I remove the new pc.mnfst, the game runs correctly.

2. When I try to export the texts from the new pc.mnfst which I modified I get this error message


and I only get the English text file.

I think the main issue here is that Darksiders_Warmastered_MNFST_Tool doesn't work correctly when importing texts to pc.mnfst.
I hope someone can help me to solve this issue.

Thanks

Did you try to make small change for testing purpose first?
Like changing only one letter to keep original text size?


Also, what is the size of the new pc.mnfst?

Hey ikskoks,

Q\ Did you try to make a small change for testing purposes first?
Like changing only one letter to keep the original text size?
A\ Yes, I only changed one letter for testing purposes and I got an error.
I tried changing each text file separately and I got the same error with each one of them.
The English text file works fine.

Q\ Also, what is the size of the new pc.mnfst?
A\The original pc.mnfst file and the modified one has the same size.
pc.mnfst 3577 KB
new pc.mnfst 3577 KB

Ok, so you should probably contact Delutto and ask him for tool update.
I think that he is still active on zenhax forum.
