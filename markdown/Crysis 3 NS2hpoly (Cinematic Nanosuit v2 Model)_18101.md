- Post Title: Crysis 3 NS2hpoly (Cinematic Nanosuit v2 Model)

Ok, I know I'm like, really late to ask questions about Crysis 3, and I've noticed this sooner, it just didn't come to my mind to ask anyone about this.

There's cinematic high-poly model of the Nanosuit v2 in the game files.. No idea why they would remove the textures but keep the model, but it's there, under "ObjectsChar.pak\Objects\characters\human\us\nanosuit_v2\cinematic"
I was wondering if the textures for that model were ever released or even seen outside the cinematics. Looking at the files, the material for the model was located under "Objects/characters/human/us/nanosuit_v2/cinematic/tex_highRes/NS2hpoly"

I was also wondering if anyone ever noticed that model, because I couldn't find any information about it.
