- Post Title: UNPACK: Sony Ericsson Firmware Files

Hello,
I dont know if you can help me but there are a lot of people around [http://www.esato.com](http://www.esato.com) and forums.se-nse.net that want to unpack the RAW data firmware files from Sony Ericsson phones. I want help doing this and i think that you have the resources to help us. The files can be found over [http://www.topsony.com](http://www.topsony.com) registration to the forum is required. I cant attach the file here because it's bigger that 10MB. If you are going to help, try doing it first in k750i/w800i firmwares.

Thanks a lot,
Lex

if you just use the FILE SPLITTER here on the site then you can cut a section from the front and back of the file.
Which is all we really need to behonest.
As soon as i sort out the STRANGE problem with my Hex workshop il take a look at this and maybe throw it at STUNS see if it decompresses anything worthwhile.
Still im confused with hex as it keeps opening and closing itself when i try use it.

I need help using file splitter! it says that i dont have a updated version of comdlg32.ocx. what im supposed to do?

If you create a plugin to descompress the file would be possible to compress it again after alterating some files? Hope so! then people can change some images from there. I hope that unpacking it will be a better way to mod the phones! And lets check what else they have there.
