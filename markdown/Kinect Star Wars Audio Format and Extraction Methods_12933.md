- Post Title: Kinect Star Wars Audio Format and Extraction Methods

I am a little worried, since this is my first topic I’m about to post here, but I am curious to know what the audio format or the format type the sound files are encoded in. I am trying to help a friend here: [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6Pi3J ... dsITtoJWRg](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6Pi3JvzHSLCjdsITtoJWRg) acquire the sounds for the game. This is how he does it: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tLK5R4JBmE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tLK5R4JBmE).

Plainly, though, it does not work for all games. He has tried many other tricks for other games, but to no avail. Right now, he is working getting the sounds from Star Wars Rogue Squadron II: Rogue Leader and Rogue Squadron III: Rebel Strike, but I would like to help him out more if I can. My efforts on those games have not been good; the .dat files the sounds are encoded in are specially encrypted so that no .dat extractors, readers, or anything can decode them.

However, I would like to help him a little with acquiring additional sound effects for him by asking for other games he cannot get to and knows not how. If I knew the file types of the game, as well as The Force Unleashed I and II, and the techniques needed to acquire them, I’m sure he would appreciate it. Can you help us both?

Okay, thanks.

I’ll see about sending it to iteachvader. Now all I need is how to crack the sound files for Kinect Star Wars. He has also had trouble with Star Wars: The Clone Wars (2002) and Star Wars: The Old Republic. Any additional help would be grateful.

Okay...

But the link concerning Kinect Star Wars, how does it relate to the sound files in that game? Not the music, I’m talking about the sound effects, the lightsabers, blasters, vehicles, droids, creatures, etc. How would iteachvader and I try to even get at them? Extract them for instance as .wav files for video projects?

Grab the PS2 version and use PSound on ALLWAV.MSB (1236 sound effects, streams and VOs)

I’ve got the PS2 version, but how would I use the program on it? How would I be able to get a PS2 game onto the computer exactly?

ps2 discs use a standard DVD filesystem I think, typically you can just put them in your dvd-rom drive and view the files inside. xbox and gamecube games didn't let you do it though.  it's actually one of the reasons the main ps2 emulators let you play the ps2 game straight from the dvd on your pc.

on my side, i'm still looking for a Noesis plugin for .smf files
abandoned Battlefront 3 and Kinect, share the same models database , most are in .smf format

With all due respect, another user disagrees:

I wonder know how I would be able to extract the sound effects themselves.

as you want, trust me or not .... but as soon as you unpack the xb2pkgsnd.POD
the unpacker create a folder sound, with files and extension  .wem

because i have unpack it, the file xb2pkgsnd.POD ....



if you want a sample
[http://www.filedropper.com/412339922](http://www.filedropper.com/412339922)

you need to find the way to convert it in wave format ....

Hey, Acewell, I found this for an ISO: [http://www.theisozone.com/downloads/pla ... lone-wars/](http://www.theisozone.com/downloads/playstation/ps2-isos/star-wars--the-clone-wars/). But a friend of mine says that is an ISO for Star Wars: Clone Wars, the hand-drawn animated series of 2003-2005. What do you think it is?

I found a way to extract the audio with proper file names using a wav scanner.

Here are the English voices: [https://archive.org/details/KinectStarWarsEnglishVoices](https://archive.org/details/KinectStarWarsEnglishVoices)

And here are the sound effects: [https://archive.org/details/KinectStarWarsSoundEffects](https://archive.org/details/KinectStarWarsSoundEffects)
