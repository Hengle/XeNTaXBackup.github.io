- Post Title: Forced Showdown - Export assets files

Hi everyone! I used the program called AssetsBundleExtractor to open the .assets files to see if I can edit the texts game to translate to my language. But the program seems cant import back the edited file. Anyone knows this program, can help me?

Sorry for the bad english!
