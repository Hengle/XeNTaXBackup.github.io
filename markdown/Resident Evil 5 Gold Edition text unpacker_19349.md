- Post Title: Resident Evil 5 Gold Edition text unpacker

Hello. Me and my friend did a translation for RE5 Gold a few years ago, but since then many people reporting that the game updated the localization files and our translation simply just doesn't work anymore. Since i was only responsible for the translation itself and not the technical side, i have no idea which tools should i use to take a brief look on the problem. Can you hand me the required tools or let me know which way should i start? thanks!
