- Post Title: Zentia archive .dpk help

Zentia ([http://z.us.changyou.com/](http://z.us.changyou.com/)) has a resource.dpk that is 1.3GB in size, and since the entire game is 1.5GB, it's pretty obvious that the vast majority (if not all) of models, textures, and audio is in it.
Is there anyone here that has the game and can experiment with it? I tried Starmagedeon, Battle Strike - Road to Berlin, Project Earth, Space Interceptor, and Terrorist Takedown's .dpk setting for the heck of it, but it doesn't work with a invalid string error.

If no one here has it that has the ability to experiment with it, there is also a update.dpk file that is only 7mb I could upload, but I'm not 100% sure it's the same format as the main 1.3GB resource.dpk file.
