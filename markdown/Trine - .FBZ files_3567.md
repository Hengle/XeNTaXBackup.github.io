Thank you!

The only sad thing is that BGM files are encrypted tho :< oh well...

Also, some files are 0 bytes... are you sure they unpacked correctly?

I don't know the reason of the 0 bytes files.
use the following script and send me the file test.dat that it generates:

```
log test.dat 0x22303ea8 0xffff
```

Code: Select alllog test.dat 0x22303ea8 0xffff

@Kein
no, that script can't generate a file of zero bytes.
in my opinion you are using an old version of quickbms, retry with the latest one:
