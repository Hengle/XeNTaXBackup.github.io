- Post Title: Ace Combat 6 .PAC

I would like to rip models from ace combat 6 (xbox 360) and I think they are in the data01.pac (as they were in ace combat 5 and zero). this game was made by namco in 2007

I have the archive

[http://www.zshare.net/download/79619982702d1752/](http://www.zshare.net/download/79619982702d1752/)


I also have information on ace combat 5's models that were in the data.pac though I don't think they are related

(note I deleted the old topic and made a new one because the old one had no upload)
