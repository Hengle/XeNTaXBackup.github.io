- Post Title: Eric's Model Importers + Archive Exporters :) (Noesis)

Hey, I don't know if this it the right place for this or not, but I'd assume so. Recently, I've gotten into writing Noesis python scripts (all thanks to mariokart64n's videos, I picked it up rather quickly), and I'd thought I'd share my work here. I'm not a total "master" yet at reversing, but I've made a lot of progress in figuring out archive formats. I've recently started to figure out model formats, but I'm still struggling slightly in that department. Hopefully I'll be able to write more scripts as I gain more knowledge on how to further reverse models and archives. All of my scripts can be found here:

Thanks!

Great stuff!

Do you happen to take any kind of requests at all, I've got a few simpler file formats where the textures are already extracted its only the models remaining, and they're static anyway, its the ff9 world map if you might be interested in that at all.

Sure! send some samples, I'll try my best:).
