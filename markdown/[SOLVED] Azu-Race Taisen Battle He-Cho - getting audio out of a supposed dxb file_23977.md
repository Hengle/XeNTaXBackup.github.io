- Post Title: [SOLVED] Azu-Race Taisen Battle He-Cho - getting audio out of a supposed dxb file

The game that used it (Azu-Race Taisen Battle He-Cho) is a PC doujin from 2003, but nevertheless I tried the Ratatouille quickBMS script to no avail.  It at least appears to be little more than a host for ogg files, but as someone completely new to this, I can't be entirely sure that there's no encoding.  Finally, sprites have been ripped previously from this format before, but contacting the person originally responsible for doing so has yielded no results.  Help, please?

The .ogg files don't have any filenames stored, so you can just rip them directly with something like DragonUnpacker, and they'll play fine.

That worked!  Thank you very much.
