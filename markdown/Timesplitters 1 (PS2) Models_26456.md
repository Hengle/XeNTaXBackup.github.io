- Post Title: Timesplitters 1 (PS2) Models

Greetings, I am actually a huge fan of the timesplitters games. 

I been ripping models and etc for the games since a week ago. 

I am happy to find a Noesis plugin for the xbox models for TS2.

How ever, I am having trouble finding plugins for the models of TS1. 

Since i want both the character models and weapons.

Since they seem to be using the .raw format.

While i have managed to rip the models from TS1 pak files.

I wonder if someone will be willing to help me to find a way for me to view these models in a program like Noesis. 

Since i am having trouble finding info for the .raw format itself.

Any help of teaching me to view these models will be very helpful

I'm in the same boat as you, I tried extracting the .PAK files using quickbms but all I get are .raw files. I wonder what the data is, because I don't think these are actually raw files, since they can't be opened with any converters or viewers.
