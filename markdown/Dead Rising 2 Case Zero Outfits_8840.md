- Post Title: Dead Rising 2: Case Zero Outfits

With the help of the DR2 Modding community ([http://www.deadrising2mods.proboards.com](http://www.deadrising2mods.proboards.com)) I have extracted the exclusive outfits from Case Zero. They're in .big and .tex format and seem to look almost the exact same as any DR2 .big and .tex file. 

However these files appear to be written backwards; no string of 0's is visible in a hex editor compared to DR2's .bigs. We have been at this for almost a year with no luck. I was wondering if the great Xentax community could help us out.

We have been able to remove the basic Xbox encryption thanks to a script by Aluigi but the files are still messed up.

Here's a DR2 Outfit called "Mid Length Tshirt Jeans" which is a poor reskin of Chuck's Orange Ijiek Shirt from Case Zero. It's an official outfit with no modifications. Also contains QuickBMS Scripts to extract contents of both .big and .tex:

And here's a Case Zero Outfit, it's Chuck's Orange Ijiek Shirt, also in .big and .tex:

Thanks!
