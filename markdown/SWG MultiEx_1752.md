- Post Title: SWG MultiEx?

Hello, I am looking to modify the SWG UI to custom fit my needs (the current one is so fugly) I played around with InsideSWG and Xentax TRE extractor and it seems it will not open the new TRE files, any plans to intergrate SWG file format into MultiEx?

Also, anyone know their way around TRE files? thus far I only found 2 file formats I can work with, one being a texture in DDS format (Plugin for PS) and other being an IFF info/text file of sorts. There are plenty of other file formats in there that google search does not seem to shed any light on.

I am doing this because I would like to modify the interface to style it with my guilds theme.

10x for help in advance.
