- Post Title: [PS1]Time Crisis (.ULZ) file

Hello Everyone

I am trying to translate Time Crisis and I found many of these ULZ compressed files in the game

I tried using AC3's ulz decompression tool to process this ulz file, but it seems that the ulz versions of the two games are not the same

Here is example ulz file:[https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hvSrt7 ... sp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hvSrt70xBT4Vx9kA0XC_6yKJAfH9X7wg/view?usp=sharing)

Sorry For My Bad English.
