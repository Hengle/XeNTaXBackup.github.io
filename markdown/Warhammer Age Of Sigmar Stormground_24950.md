I have had no luck trying to unpack and extract from these files. I think its unreal 4, but besides the pak fil there is sig fil. Help would be appreciated.  Sampel files included.   Thanks.

Warhammer Age of Sigmar: Storm Ground is indeed using Ureal Engine 4, version 4.25.

Paks can easily be browsed with [Gildor's UE Viewer](https://www.gildor.org/en/projects/umodel).

AES key is required; can be found in the usual [place](https://cs.rin.ru/forum/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=100672).

Static meshes are generally low quality (full game is only 4GB).

Skeletal meshes are somewhat better,

Cheers,
