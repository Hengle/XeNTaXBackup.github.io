- Post Title: [PC] Resident Evil 6 .WAV

Hi, I have managed to unpack some .WAV files and it appears that they sound wrong. Can anyone tell me what is wrong with these files? I have attached some samples from Leon's files.

72.wav - Good work.
73.wav - Not too shabby.
79.wav - I can't right now.

You can make some of them out but other not.

Cheers

It's from PC like the title. I made the .SPC unpacker however i'm unsure as to why when I unpack the WAV files they seem to sound like this.

Yes I tried your tool. It works for the xbox .SPC files as it spits out .xma instead of .wav and plays however its sped up really fast. I tried everything but couldnt fix it
