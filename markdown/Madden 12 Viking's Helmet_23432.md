- Post Title: Madden 12 Viking's Helmet

With the use of shakotay's hex2obj tool, I've been extracting the models of the mascots found in Madden 12. I've had success with each character up until the last one, that being Viktor the Viking. I've been able to get every submesh except for his helmet. I checked to make sure I had entered the right addresses, but whenever I tried to view the mesh, it would appear as a scrambled mess. Any help would be appreciated. I've attached a file of the helmet, for anyone willing to help. The addresses are 11 for the face indices, and 1B9E for the vertices.

Not too hard if you know (you do, don't you?  ) that big endian is used:

(uvs were a little bit trickier)

I'm afraid I don't quite understand. I've set hex2obj to use bigE, but this is the resulting mesh I get. Is there something I'm missing?

brokenhelmet.pngwell, watch the format! Why did you set it to short all (means using short for vertices and uvs)?
In fact it is "HF_UV", means using half float for uvs and float for vertices.

Maybe update your browser's cache (I have the strange feeling that the first picture I uploaded had "WordUV"  ).

Ah, my bad! I've been using ShortAll out of habit, since I was used to all the other meshes using it... 
With that, I've finally gotten all the mascot models I've been looking for. I would've been completely lost without your help, so I want to say thank you very much! I mean it!
