- Post Title: Does anyone have a Godzilla Save The Earth Map Editor?

I heard from another forum that there is someone here who created a Godzilla Save The Earth map editor.
Does anyone know anything about the tool?

Maybe...
The forumer I mentioned stated that he never got the tools when he asked for them from the guy who claimed to have made the STE map editor so there is also the possibility he was faking it which I hope not.

That was me. It's possible that the user no longer has the tools/research for STE (it's been nearly seven years since he first mentioned it here) or perhaps he just doesn't want to give it out. Or maybe he just forgot. Either way, I didn't want to bother him about it any longer because I didn't want to be rude or demanding.

Oh, ok. Thanks for replying! It's a shame he never released it to the public though...
