Hi I'm looking to make (or find) a full audio dump of shadow of Mordor. the problem is I have no Idea how to go about this. the game confuses me. the sound folder seems to only have voice overs, there does not seem to be a music folder. I'm guessing the rest is in the arch05 files but I have as of yet found no way to extract these. any help or info would be greatly appreciated. also does anyone know if a full audio dump already exists? Also can anyone tell me where the music is stored? Can't find it.

Music and all other audio is stored in standard WWISE audio banks. Files named .bnk

Music is the ones named mus_....

You can extract these with bnkextr and convert with ww2ogg or any other tool working with wwise

By those I meant the programs you mentioned not the game files

You wouldn't happen to know if the dlc added new music or where that is stored, would you?

Sorry but I have no idea as I haven't played the game or looked at the files myself.
