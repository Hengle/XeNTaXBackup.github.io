Hi all i'm new here.  Is there a way to convert re5 lmt animation files to be view and extracted for use for a game engine or to be used in 3ds max?

Sorry, I scoured Google and all I could find were 1.) LMT Tool,  a tool for swapping LMT animations between characters without actually decoding them, and 2.) someone long ago begging in the Noesis topic, only to get snubbed for linking to copyrighted LMT files or something. edit: 3.) Ah, and a couple people asking in the same 2 forums where they were discussing LMT Tool, but not to any success.

Maybe I'll take a look myself later, but no promises.
