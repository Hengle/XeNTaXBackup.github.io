- Post Title: Rayman 2 - (LZSS?) Compression

Hey everyone,

I'm trying to extract textures from Rayman 2 for Dreamcast. They're in the [PVR format](http://fabiensanglard.net/Mykaruga/tools/segaPVRFormat.txt), but it seems they are compressed.
I extracted the textures from an archive with a "LZSS" header - so that's why I think they might be LZSS-compressed.
Any help? 

Here's my script for the archives, some example archives and some example compressed PVR files: [https://app.box.com/s/xi2u1i35ww7fdubs7zxz](https://app.box.com/s/xi2u1i35ww7fdubs7zxz)

Many thanks!
Droolie.

Thanks, but I have. The PVR files I extracted from the archives don't work in it because they seem to use another compression on top of the PVR format (should be LZSS) - that's what my question is about. The uncompressed files should be viewable with PVR Viewer.
