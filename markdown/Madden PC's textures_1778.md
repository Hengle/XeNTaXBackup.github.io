- Post Title: Madden PC's textures

Hey - I'm Nza from Football-Freaks.com. We've been working on a way to unlock Madden's textures but have been unable to determine the format of said textures.

Using Game Extractor, we can extract files such as PLYRFACE.DAT, however the files inside are seemingly of a non existent format. They bare no resemblence to any graphics format i've seen, and we've tried just about everything we can.

I was hoping maybe we could reach out to some experts who may be able to help, as I fear we've pretty much maxed out the available expertise the Madden PC community has to offer. I've tried using TextureFinder, but it didn't help.

I'm trying to attach a file from the PLYRFACE.DAT, but the forum won't let me, it says it doesn't support the format (the file has no extension). Is there a way I can upload the mystery file here?

We were able to figure out a way to view the textures - well, sort of. What we did is use the program Cheat Engine which has an inbuilt function called "Direct X-Mess". This allowed us to extract the textures loaded into DX's memory to BMP. Unfortunately, that doesn't help us figure out the format at all, but it did give us a glimpse at what we're dealing with. Here's an example face texture extracted from the game using this method:



Any help is HIGHLY appreciated. Madden is the only EASports PC game that is without any leinancy when it comes to texture editing, and we'd love to be able to change that.

Thanks!

Well, just zip the file and then upload it.  So we can take a  ook at it here!

Ahhh, zip, of course, didn't think of that 

I included a few to look at.

I think it may be tough here. 
I would only imagine that NFL stars, being just only human as they are, could find of no amusment at all to see their "liknesses"  somehow altered   That could have even been a stringent stipulation to the EA's licence allowing to use their true face bitmaps as a textures. 
Just a thought.

BTW I find that Cheat Engine interesting? What else, besides dumping the pictures,  can be done with it?  Does this work with each and every game?

I have been trying this for a few days on the PS2 system. I dont really want to change the actual stars of the game, just insert my picture as a created player as well as some Hall of Famers to give them classic teams some faces and names.
