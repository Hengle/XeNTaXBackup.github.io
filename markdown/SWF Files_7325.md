Have you tried an alternative ripper?

Such as - [http://www.flash-ripper.net/](http://www.flash-ripper.net/)

Perhaps if it is locking up on a certain file, that file is actually damaged or protected.
You really should have posted a link to the SWF and what you needed out of it.

People, there's not much help in researching SWF files, please help with these.

There are lot of online games i'd translate, but Sothink SWF Decompiler and Flash Decomplier Thrillix are useless, they doesn't show any content assosiated with ingame strings.

In these days more and more flash game developers use protections against decompilers and may be that's the problem.

If anyone w'd help, i'll provide a sample game.

thx
