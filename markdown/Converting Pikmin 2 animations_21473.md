- Post Title: Converting Pikmin 2 animations

Hi, I've managed to extract Pikmin 2 models with their original skeletons. I've been searching the web for about a week now trying to find information of convert the animation files to something that 3DS Max can read. The format of the animations are BCA (and according to the wiki, there are also BCK animation files but I have yet to see them). It would mean a lot if someone could help me out with this, if you require anymore information then let me know.

Cheers

Apologies for bumping such an old post, but I'm interested in helping out on this!

I've been getting into modding in the last few months, working on a very similar project to rip Ocarina of Time's models/rigs/animations and export them to a useful format (.glTF specifically, for portability). I kind of cheated by starting from another developer's project, Utility of Time, but I've just recently gotten to the point where I'm able to export them and import into Blender. (I've catalogued my progress on my Twitter if you're interested: [https://twitter.com/MeltyPlayer](https://twitter.com/MeltyPlayer))

The next game I wanted to look into was Pikmin 1 or 2, so if you're already this far then that saves me a lot of work, lol. Let me know if you're still interested in any help!

Dude yes please  any and all help is greatly appreciated. If you have a Discord you should add me for easier contact on this @ Cpt. Hazama#0530
Of course, if we can get something to work I'll post back on this forum as I'm sure we're not the only ones interested in ripping Pikmin animations
