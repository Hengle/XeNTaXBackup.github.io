Are you selecting the area you want to be transparent prior to saving.  I know when making transparent pngs, I use the Magic Wand Tool to select the area I want to be transparent prior to saving.  I don't usually make my own textures, so I'm not sure if DDS works the same way.

With photoshop and dds files you have to make a alpha channel which says what is visible. To do so you gotta flatten you image into one layer then select the layer contents (ctrl + click on the layer's thumbnail in the list) and then you have to go to the channels panel and make a new channel (when you make it the image will go black cause thats the default alpha) then you get your fill tool and make sure white is your foreground and fill in the layer you selected. then just save your file as dds (and make sure you check the box that says saving alpha channel too or it wont work).

for alpha channel 100% black is 100% transparent. 100% white is 100% opaque.
