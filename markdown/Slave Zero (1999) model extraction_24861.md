- Post Title: Slave Zero (1999) model extraction?

Hello,

I'm (newbie to this) am trying to extract models from a 1999 game called slave zero. Other people in this forum managed to expert textures, but models are more tricky: They use a proprietary format that has models and other stuff like animations and baked in the same file. 
I had spoken with some devs of the game a few years ago, and they had told me that they had used 3dstudio max with custom script back then to create the files. 
What I am hoping is that I can find something like the header of a obj file inside the proprietary file and extract it manually.
do you guys have any tips or help you can give? Thanks!
