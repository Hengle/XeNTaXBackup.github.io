- Post Title: Psygnosis Bram Stokers Dracula DOS version .PAC files

I need help with extracting some files from a psygnosis game, "Bram Stokers Dracula" for DOS. The file format
is .PAC, i have figured out that files beginning with W store wall and floor textures (apart from WIZOB.PAC
which stores item sprites and pictures), files beginning with S store the games sound effects and music, 
files beginning with M store monster sprites, files beginning with D store screens. I have figured out what they contain by 
switching the files around or removing them from the directory, but i would like to find out how they can be extracted.

Can anyone help me with this?
I have provided a few of the files.
