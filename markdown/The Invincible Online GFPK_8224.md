Archives are the same as in Dragona and QueensBlade but without xoring filenames. Example attached.

in this case it's enough that you take one of the 2 scripts made for the other games and add a # before the filexor command, like the following:

```
# filexor "0x78 0x6C 0x61 0x71 0x6A 0x23 0x65 0x6D 0x24 0x25 0x5E 0x66 0x6B 0x40 0x23 0x24 0x72 0x68 0x21 0x40 0x23 0x73 0x6B 0x40 0x23 0x24 0x21 0x00"
```

It's not reading the paths properly
Other than that, same model format as their other two games.

Try extracting PC archive and you'll find it gives names, but the names are cut off and it's getting numbers at the end.

```
get files short
get null short
for i = 0 < files
get id long
putarray 0 i id
next i
for i = 0 < files
get id1 long
putarray 1 i id1
next i
for i = 0 < files
getarray OFFSET 1 i
if OFFSET == -1
getdstring null 0x310 #this is the recursive directory info but we can skip it in this game
endif
if OFFSET != -1
getdstring basename 0xF8
get SIZE long
get UNK01 long
get UNK02 long
getdstring NULL 0x2
getdstring NAME 0x20A
putarray 2 i SIZE
putarray 3 i NAME
endif
next i
savepos base
for i = 0 < files
getarray OFFSET 1 i
getarray SIZE 2 i
getarray NAME 3 i
math OFFSET + base
if NAME != 0
log NAME OFFSET SIZE
endif
next i

```

Check the client request thread in 3D section. Iaw posted a newer link cause they updated the client to some other version.

endif

for i = 0 < files
  get id long
  putarray 0 i id
next i

for i = 0 < files
  get id1 long
  putarray 1 i id1
next i

for i = 0 < files
  getarray OFFSET 1 i
  if OFFSET == -1
    getdstring null 0x310 #this is the recursive directory info but we can skip it in this game
  endif
  if OFFSET != -1
    getdstring basename 0xF8
    get SIZE long
    get UNK01 long
    get UNK02 long
    getdstring NULL 0x2
    getdstring NAME 0x20A
    putarray 2 i SIZE
    putarray 3 i NAME
    print %SIZE%
  endif
next i

filexor ""
savepos base
for i = 0 < files
  getarray OFFSET 1 i
  getarray SIZE 2 i
  getarray NAME 3 i
