- Post Title: Destroy All Humans (.PKG Files)

I recently obtained a demo version of the game Destroy All Humans and I noticed that it was built from one of the later beta builds of the game. The interface is different and some different sounds are used as well. My goal is to extract all of the beta sounds from this version of the game, as the archives that contain the game sounds are of a larger size. So it is probable that many unused beta sounds are still present. There's one little problem however. Many of the game's assets are compressed in .PKG archives and it appears nobody has successfully cracked the format yet. Linked to this post is a bunch of sample .PKG files I grabbed from the demo. I also included a couple of .DIR files as they might be used during the game's unpacking process.
