- Post Title: [PS3] Ken's Rage HOKUTO MUSOU

Hi everyone,

I'm quite new to the scene and I'm currently trying to extract the LINKDATA.A files of the PS3 game Ken's Rage (Hokuto Musou, Pal) and modify the character textures.
I remember having seen an X360 quickBMS script, but cannot find a similar one for the PS3 version!
Anyone can help me out with it?

Thanks alot!

I manually created the file LINKDATA.A from the xex file on the 360.
you will have to unencrypt and search through the ps3 self file for the directory info to create that file.

I've finally managed to import custom music into Ken's Rage! 

-Install the ATRAC 3 codec
-Use Goldwave and save the custom file in .WAV with the ATRAC3 compression (Audio: 132 Kbps; 44.100 Hz; Stereo; Sony SCX)
-Rename to at3
-Enjoy!

Updates!

Finally found out the offsets of Ken's Rage models of PS3 and tried model swap.
The result is you can even play with the NPC such as Shu!
