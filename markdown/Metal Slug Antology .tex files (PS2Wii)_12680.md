- Post Title: Metal Slug Antology .tex files (PS2/Wii)

I used to think that only the PSP version of Metal Slug Anthology came with Unlockable Art. After my last post I finally got myself the PS2 and Wii versions. The files were again packed into standard POD3 archives, but the textures themselves are encoded in a different way.

[Here](https://cloud.mail.ru/public/785a92acc98c/ps2wiiexamples.zip) are some examples from both versions. Would really appreciate if someone could help me with these.
