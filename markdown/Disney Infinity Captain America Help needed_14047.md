- Post Title: Disney Infinity Captain America Help needed

Hello guys, 

I'm brand new here, so I apologise if this is in the wrong section. I've been searching the internet for hours looking for the 3D model assets of Disney Infinity. I need both Captain America and Ironman (I can live without Ironman, if need be). I don't need rigs or animations. Just the basic T-pose or what ever it comes with.

I want to do something for my little brothers birthday in a few weeks, so I need them pretty fast. I've been looking at a model viewer, but that has got me no where. Is there anyone that can help me out? I'm getting pretty desperate.

Thanks.

Yep, it is. Totally.

This is a forum for model research, not for model sharing.

Luckily I have a Captain from my MakeH2O project on my harddrive.
Guess he's not from Disney Infinity, dunno:
