- Post Title: Homefront: The Revolution serialized XML/LUA help

Firstly, apologies if this isn't the right subforum. I'm interested in trying to mod Homefront: The Revolution, but there is a barrier. The game's xml and lua files are serialized using a custom format. All the existing CryEngine xml tools fail, including Sir Kane's, which I used for Sniper: Ghost Warrior 3. I know this is a long shot, but I was hoping someone with the know-how might be able to help me convert them to plaintext. I already have the ability to extract files and make the game load them from unsigned pak files. The problem is modifying the files.

I've included two sample files. I'm mainly interested in the XML format, but the lua format would be a nice bonus.
