Ung is just an archive.

There are two other files in the data folder called "core.ung" and "script.ung"
It's the same archive format, and since demo is so big, it probably has everything related to the game.

The file is compressed and I don't know how it works. You can upload those two archives and see if someone will figure it out.
Maybe someone has also asked about the archive format on the unigine forums. Maybe the format is provided? I don't know.

I wonder if they use their own proprietary format for models.
