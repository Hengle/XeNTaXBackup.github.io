- Post Title: PCSX2-3DVIA-3DRIPER How to Rip Last Tread

I surf by the net by years and i see lots of posts, something its trash another are usefull and of course anothers need be reconsiderated, becuase of this i try make this post only to show usefull information, please not request nothing or post nothing abouth other thinks, this its dedicated only to show how to rip models from pcsx2 emulator with 3d via and 3d ripper DX.
Experts on this like mariokart64, chrox, mr adults, nexxxus, obesebear, are welcome to post any idea, correction or released skill.

The first point its the best way to rip models from dvd of PS2 games its extraction directly from the dvd game, infortunatly the only man can do this its a frances boy with the nick of Yazor (Lord of Lords on this) he ripped Final Fantasy and Kingdom Hearts models from games, but he leave the forums long time ago.


Then the only way to the newebies like me its try with PCSX2 Emulator and 3D RIPER DX OR 3D VIA PRINT SCREEN.

I show how this works with screens and not only with letters cause latters something times are confused and one image tell more than 1000 words.

For this its necesary the next files
DVD ISO from the PS2 GAME
3D VIA PRINT SCREEN PROGRAM
3D RIPPER DX PROGRAM
3DS STUDIO MAX 9 (this works fine for me)
KoichiSenad max plugin 
http://www.4shared.com/dir/5807782/1c39 ... enada.html
Speed PC (cause the emulator take lots of memory)
Also its important tell try this in Win Xp cause Vista use DirectX10 and thiw works only with DX9

When you have this open your emulator PCSX2 with 3D RIPPER DX FIRST AND choose this Plugins GSDX9 (texture dump) this plugin help to dump textures to the designed 3D Ripper DX folder, ZeroGS (model dump) this plugin dump the models to the designed 3D Ripper DX folder
(then 3dripper dx + gdx 1.7 for texture and gsplugin for mesh). 

Here a configuration i use for this


In normal Games all works fine and its posible load the model withouth troubles in max 9 with the 3d ripper dx plugin installed, but on this case with the emulator when you capture a model you can see this looks flated like this:



I not make a large explication how this hapen, but only can tell its because a overlay system of the emulators project only 2 sides like 2D not 3D, this save lot of memory cuase of this its configured.

For 3d ripper i found a model of Kosmos and the skill posted by sarha (another hiden) this:
you need to have 2 views of the exact same frame capture using 3d ripper dx.
the only way to do this is in the model viewer mode. take 1 capture straight on then take one side profile snapshot.--- she show this model released:



Bad for all she only talk abouth how this its posible, but in the practice something thinks changued, she never post screens step by step how this its posible and all the work are lost.
Years ago since 2008 something user post he have a max-script, this can convine this 2 views and fix the model, but i shure its fake, i search the plugin and also a death links and i not found nothing abouth this.

This its all with 3D ripper DX system i found usefull any correction please tell me.

The good news its 3DVIA Print Screen works bether.
Mariokart64 tell the captures with 3DVIA keep all the axis also the z axis, only its necesary
scale the Y axis by 20 000 000 x and the mesh should unfold.the problem is some models back cull, but back culling can be fixed only delething the back culling faces and reasing the textures.
On this mariokart64 explain why the Y axis need be scaled, cause the y axis control the depth of the models captured, personaly i see its posible scale the Y axis in 3ds max but i not tested yet cause i not ripped a model too.

x=Side-to-Side
y=Front-to-Back
z=Up-to-Down

on this proces its necesary install first the KoichiSenada plugin for max, and asign the keys to load the plugin, this to load the files generated by 3dvia print screen.

I test this and its this all i be done its a .png file: you can see to the left of the pick wath i am extracted. So maybe its a configuration issue i test all the posible configurations i can found tonight and post wath hapend tomorrow

I have been unable to say whether this works or not. 3dvia printscreen does not support windows 7 so pcsx2 crashes whenever I try to run a game while printscreen is open. 

Note: When run in XP SP2 compatibility mode pcsx2 does not crash but printscreen does not work.

Well i back with the 2nd part of this tutorial tread
Tonight i test rip with 3dvia and 3d ripper now i show all wath hapend and how this its posible also i make screenshots step by step for all, i added too a tutorial to fix the problem with the ripped textures in lots of games, the colors have distorsion.

Something times 3dvia make files of 1kb size, not close the program continue pressing F12 and with patience you see the models are captured








This its the resume of the experiment, all this information its from lots of people and years of investigation, today i try with other machine one old machine with Nvidia Video card, and post wath happend, in the next tread i put a guide to fix the damaged textures captured from the PCSX2 emulator.....

 The main problem is what tool that you use to ripp. 3dvia printscreen destroy or stretch UV maps in most of cases (it dependes by the type of emu ,type of game,etc; instead with 3dripperdx this problem is less frequent ,but with this tool,the quality of the meshes is really variable.

I have Tried on an older computer~

AMD Athlon 64 X2 Dual
Core Processor 3800+
2.00 GHz, 1 gig of ram

Geforce GT  220
1 gig ddr3~

i tried the most recent build of pcsx2 <0.9.7> r3876

used the ZeroGS 0.97.1 plugin Default~

i tried and this is what i got~



ALSO i would like to note that even tho the UV's were fudged a little bit, i was able to fix them with a little work~

they were upside down and about 1/4 the size~ ( an Accurate guesstimation~)

Textures on the other hand were Messed up beyond repair~ they were like.... 8092 x 1 pixels. 

im still trying some stuff out atm~

very excellent, its nice to see some decent attempts.

there are 2 methods that I used to get models from pcsx2, there is also a 3rd which originated from fanfury. I've tried this way and had success, but its sort of pointless. I'd rather go for the kill, at the heart.. the files....

so I'll quickly recap

1. 3DVIA
2. 3DripperDX
3. Import Data from RAM
4. Reverse the File Format

in which case the latter of the two would take too long to convey. using 3dvia is great, it gets results quick and easy, but 90% of the time you'll never get UV's. I assume this is a result of how the game stores the UVs in the Vram. it'll vary game to game. If your good with 3D editing, it wont take long to reconstruct the geometry and re-UV. 
your probably aware that geometry has to be taken with zeroGS, as textures with GSDX9+. both plugins have to have compatibility to get both geo and tex..
anyway the only for sure way to get UVs is by using 3dripperDX, but it wont get you Y. I've said in the past to merge 2 rips to solve for Y but this wont do if the rips are not identical in size.
most games use backface culling to conserve memory.. so it wont work 50% of the time.

3DVIA is the only working method at the moment, the devs who made the PCSX2 plugins don't give a damn. so dont get your hopes up on this method, or the people who made pcsx2.

Why you ask how abouth use 3dvia printscreen in playstation 2 emulator? read all the thread and you found how to use.

Abouth the GA mark its not visible in windows vista or 7, cause i can see in windows XP, also its the same for me i buy the tool gameassassin and also i activate the tool but the CAPTURE BUTOM continue in gray, i send lots of emails to blade the creator of the tool and i continue waiting answer.

I've made a dot-point revised copy of the PCSX2 texture rip colour reversal guide for Adobe Photoshop CS3 Extended.

How to follow the procedure:
Open affected image in Adobe Photoshop CS3 Extended.
Bring up the image's colour channel window.
Duplicate the red and blue channels seperate from the image.
Delete the image's original red and blue channels.
Paste the red channel into the image's blue channel and vice versa for the blue channel.

However, this method does not work for my version of Adobe Photoshop, which is from CS5 Extended. Upon trying to paste into seperate colour channels, nothing happens. This version only allows pasting into the RGB section of the colour channel window. Does anyone know of an alternative method (suitable for Adobe Photoshop CS5 Extended or otherwise?)

I buy the tool 2 weeks ago, the Gameassassin tool doesnt work, i send 14 messages via email to blade the creator and also i post 5 messages in the gameassassin forum asking why the tool not work, I have this answer from blade:

GA has two work mode.
the "capture" and "custom capture" button is used in "Normal mode".
You can use "Load" button to run game in "Expand mode"

Well, I found a method that works with Adobe Photoshop CS5 Extended. I may as well post it.

How to follow the procedure:
Open affected image in Adobe Photoshop CS5 Extended.
Navigate to Image>Adjustments>Channel Mixer...
Set the 'Output Channel:' selection to 'Red'.
Decrease the red source channel to 0% and increase the blue source channel to 100%.
Set the 'Output Channel:' selection to 'Blue'.
Decrease the blue source channel to 0% and increase the red source channel to 100%.
Select 'OK'.

This may work for other versions of Adobe Photoshop.

For anyone who was curious about 3dvia, you right click on the tray icon and set where it sends the captures too, and the hotkey. I've played with 3dripper and pcsx2. I get the idea about taking a shot from the front and from the side, but because pcsx2 backculls, I don't think you could ever get the exact same number of faces... and to my knowledge the morpher modifier in 3dsmax only works on meshes with the same number of verts and faces. Could be wrong though, and I use version 9 of max. What I like about 3dvia is it retains some of the z-depth, so you can unflatten the captured mesh. But, cause of camera perspective, most of the captures I get are odd. I've also captured a shot during a cutscene (KH) where only the character's face is shown on screen, but the capture shows the entire body and the background that was cropped out in the framed shot. Interesting. lol

That is, unless they already have.

his methods not a secret if thats what you mean.

he maintains his own PS2 blog, in which he explains what he does and the basic PS2 strucutre. and I'm sure he's mentioned here on the forum a few times too. not to mention I just explained it above.

the other method of the 2 captures is something I came up with. but like someone just said, backface culling prevents this method from being effective. culling is only done by a handful of games though, so half the time I may work.

however to simply things for people I just tell everyone to use 3dVIA, as its a no brainier one click always works solution. i'm aware the UVs get loss, but that should not stop someone whos been spending years trying to get a single ps2 model. just take it, and fix it up.

Furry fan and chrrox are amazing at reverse engineering formats. I know furry fan uses cheat engine to look at the memory of a program and get models from that (Although that seems like a lot of work). chrrox seems to do it the old fashion way and just figure out the format by looking at several files of the same type and looking for similarities.  Just trying to say that you can have success with almost any method but you must be motivated and willing to learn very complicated systems. 

We have to figure out a way to get these guys talking to each other and sharing/gathering their results. It would speed things up and who knows, we may learn more

Wish I knew more about RAM dumping or whatnot. I think I'll take a look at that blog mentioned. 

If it's a single model trying to be ripped, I'd go with what mario said and use 3dvia. What would be better is if the model is one that isn't the player model, so there's the possibility that you are able to move around the model in a circle. If you did that, and took many snapshots, you could probably end up with all of the faces eventually captured. Although, faces that are against a surface could be a problem, such as ones that are on the 'ground'. 

either way, if you take a few dozen different snapshots with 3dvia, going in a circular rotation around the model, you could then load the meshes into maya, max or another 3d model software and fix the proportions. First you'd have to figure out what your base proportion should be, and unskew/fix the depth the first snapshot that you took. Then, load in the next snapshot, and do the same with it. 

I would record whatever transformations done to the first capture, because I think you want to do the exact same transformations to each following capture, to get the proportion exactly right. Then, you'd have to rotate each capture so that they all line up with the first capture you made.

I never tried this, so I don't know if it would really work or not though. There's also the issue that the proportion will change depending on the angle you're viewing the model from. 

In maya, you can snap verts to other verts (even if they are separate meshes) by pressing 'v' when you use the move tool, that's super useful for making sure all verts line up exactly the same for the x,y,z locations.

Since the ripped model is lack of uv and flat,or do you have other method to rip the model ??

What I do is unzip the savestate (Even though it is not .zip it still needs to be decompressed), and then search for large arrays of floating Byte Numbers (Standard Floating point numbers only take on certain values, so things like "FF FF FF FF" are not IEEE Floats)
Any data from the game that is loaded when a save state is made can be obtained, but animations would be in some ways easier and harder from a savestate. Ideally one would have the original files from the disc and a savestate that is loadable (To be loadable the settings on the savestate have to match the settings on my PCSX2 and my computer) Also for newer versions of PCSX2 one would need the elf file from the disc too. These game does use bones for the animations though which is good.

using a viewer (like for KH, if an updated version ever comes out) with the animation file available would not help?

Yes. A save state is just the state of all the current data at one moment in time. And because the savestate was taken when a model was in memory, the models bone data is in the savestate too. In this game the bones have names like jnt_x where x is the name of the bone, and the value of the bone is stored in floats underneath the name. The bones for models which have them are located near the beginning part of the memory. In the uncompressed save state there are some bones located near offset 00C2A3F0 with names like h_jnt_body and h_jnt_lfoot

So in general, would it be possible to make like a tool or maxscript to get the data from any savestate? This is quite interesting.

Oh wow... thanks so much for the info! Ergh I still suck at hex editing... but it's something. I'm still at the point of messing with kingdom hearts mset animations, and having the entire thing crash if I try to edit anything. Whooo... I WILL figure out how to combine mset animations into a master mset... well. sometime within the next century.

You know, I was looking at the plugin source for the kingdom hearts noesis import that revelation made, and well, I'm not a programmer, but I can make sense of it somewhat. 

What I'd love is a max or maya import plugin for mdls/mdlx, but of course I'd also love to win the lotto.

The only slight problem would be that some pointers to data would now be loaded meaning that say a model begins at offset 12345678 then a pointer say to vertex data might be 123456790, instead of just 18 like it would be in the raw file.
Also this method is really not good for modern computer games because they allocate memory more dynamically, meaning that parts of the same mesh file might be spread in memory over 100 MB apart from each other, and computer games usually strip headers from files when they are loaded in memory, while PS2 games tend to keeps file headers.
When looking at savesstates the same mesh might be in memory several times, with one instance being read-only and the other instances being computed on for animations.

Take animations or bones its maybe go so far, i only interested in the models meshes, nothing works a this time, 3dvia print screen and 3D ripper dx not works, also 3dvia send bakulling the models from this game, but another models are ripped fine from other games. not from this.
This its the only way i think, but its curious one think. This its the screen of the savestate i send you furry fan...

I really have the textures ripped, only the meshes its i need, in 5 years, lots of forums, lots of threads, 17 coders and 5 scripters, i never see before one can rip the models from this game. Also i never see one go so far like you with the first screen you post of the sanctuary. 
The deal continue, if you can keep out the models, i give you $200Dlls. Paypal, Western Union or any you can.
Also i have all the savestates of all the characters, i not interested in textures or bones, only meshes.
But of course if you can make a scirpt or importer or something for the DVD files, this its bether cause this files have T position.

character extraction might be difficult.

in fatduck's notes, he notes that the character meshes are effected in some strange way of a palette matrix? which I've never heard of.

furryfan's method won't work any better, unless he cracks that matrix issue. the mesh he got above is a static mesh.. unlike a vertex weighted character model.

even 3dripperdx/3dvia seem useless as the game uses face culling :\

Years ago I tried 3DR and GA, got nothing and quit. It's really nice to see so many people made progress here.


To summarize, I'm writing this post.


 # Ripping with 3rdparty tools:

Neither 3DR(short for 3D Ripper DX) nor GA(GameAssassin) can do this.
GA can rip but seems got nothing, for nothing in its 3DView, neither does that imported in 3dsMAX.
3DR got plane meshes, completely in a plane, missing Z-depth.
As for OGLE, not tried yet, which's nonsense.

Only 3DVia can rip and get flat meshes but it does have Z-depth(using ZeroGS). 
Problem:
1. The scene looks odd perhaps in a view of perspective projection(just as SoftIce says).
2. Half the faces you get are cullfaces, which is inside out.
3. UV mapping. UV might be destroyed, though it looks right in 3dsMax; textures are 4096x16(or 8192x1), in wrong width & height.
Solution:
1. Non-linear transformation for the whole scene, from a perspective projection to a parallel one. But the algorithm REALLY SUCKS for me.
2. Make all faces double sides.
3. ??? not sure yet :'(


 # Dumping with motified GS plugin:

GsDx

In the lastest version you can simply press Shift+F8 to dump the current scene, along with a normal snapshot u'll get an .obj & a .gs dump. (I got to know this feather cuz I took a glance at the GsDx src)
Problem:
1. The scene looks odd perhaps in a view of perspective projection.
2. Faces you cannot see in your current view will NOT be dumped, maybe not even rendered, which is different from ZeroGS.
3. As for UV mapping & textures, what's .gs format? 
Solution:
1. Non-linear transformation for the whole scene, from a perspective projection to a parallel one. But the algorithm REALLY SUCKS for me.
2. Motify the code, to draw every face in scene and don't consider covering up. (But I haven't got DX11SDK installed yet)
3. ??? (I'm not sure, hoping this won't be a problem 

ZeroGS

So far, I find no dumping model functions in ZeroGS src. But ZeroGS perheps draws every face in view without considering the covering up stuff. So you can get a full rip of a person, with his back.
I cannot compile ZeroGS yet, for missing Zlib and sth. But there must be at least one problem:
Problem:
1. The scene looks odd perhaps in a view of perspective projection.
2. ...
Solution:
1. Non-linear transformation for the whole scene, from a perspective projection to a parallel one. But the algorithm REALLY SUCKS for me.
2. ...
(TO DO: add up here;)


Extracting from ISO image/memory
Analysising/Reversing engineering formats

(quoted from invisghost's)

> Furry fan and chrrox are amazing at reverse engineering formats. I know furry fan uses cheat engine to look at the memory of a program and get models from that (Although that seems like a lot of work). chrrox seems to do it the old fashion way and just figure out the format by looking at several files of the same type and looking for similarities. Just trying to say that you can have success with almost any method but you must be motivated and willing to learn very complicated systems.

Furryfan's method can avoid file encryption/compression, and may get raw model data (charactors in T-position).
But the only shortcomings - it's not applicable for everyone and every game, since each game/producer has its/his own style, and it's really hard for those unfamiliar with all sorts of 3D model variable styles and structures or lacking experience. I really want an alternative method applicable for ALL PS2 emulatable games XD ^^





PS:
I'm merely a newbie, but with Emulator open source and so many works done by others we can do more!
Days ago I just succeeded dumping NDS models, see this:

I know many of your have longlast will and sharp minds, plus PCSX2 & its GS plugins are open source!!
So why wouldn't you guys look into the case?!  i.e. motifying the GS plugin code, do the whole-space transformation, etc. I think they are feasible schemes to this subject.

You can get .obj with Gsdx plugin



a scene from 'Oh!My Goddess'[JAP]


After some scaling it turns out like this:



Another case

I tried to make it uniform but still cannot get it, though FFD 2x2x2 can be non-linear.


For the above case 'Oh!My Goddess', 3dxml will get nothing but a node. 
This is just one game, there must be more that 3dxml cannot do.

Sorry 4 my bad English

Aw man, I missed that feature in GsDx? I didn't even realise its existence until now.
Thanks szfzafa.

You have to be kidding me 

Well my OBJ files are 0kb 

Managed to dump a scene from FFX. No UVs. Oh well.

> Years ago I tried 3DR and GA, got nothing and quit. It's really nice to see so many people made progress here.


To summarize, I'm writing this post.


 # Ripping with 3rdparty tools:

Neither 3DR(short for 3D Ripper DX) nor GA(GameAssassin) can do this.
GA can rip but seems got nothing, for nothing in its 3DView, neither does that imported in 3dsMAX.
3DR got plane meshes, completely in a plane, missing Z-depth.
As for OGLE, not tried yet, which's nonsense.

Only 3DVia can rip and get flat meshes but it does have Z-depth(using ZeroGS). 
Problem:
1. The scene looks odd perhaps in a view of perspective projection(just as SoftIce says).
2. Half the faces you get are cullfaces, which is inside out.
3. UV mapping. UV might be destroyed, though it looks right in 3dsMax; textures are 4096x16(or 8192x1), in wrong width & height.
Solution:
1. Non-linear transformation for the whole scene, from a perspective projection to a parallel one. But the algorithm REALLY SUCKS for me.
2. Make all faces double sides.
3. ??? not sure yet :'(


 # Dumping with motified GS plugin:

GsDx

In the lastest version you can simply press Shift+F8 to dump the current scene, along with a normal snapshot u'll get an .obj & a .gs dump. (I got to know this feather cuz I took a glance at the GsDx src)
Problem:
1. The scene looks odd perhaps in a view of perspective projection.
2. Faces you cannot see in your current view will NOT be dumped, maybe not even rendered, which is different from ZeroGS.
3. As for UV mapping & textures, what's .gs format? 
Solution:
1. Non-linear transformation for the whole scene, from a perspective projection to a parallel one. But the algorithm REALLY SUCKS for me.
2. Motify the code, to draw every face in scene and don't consider covering up. (But I haven't got DX11SDK installed yet)
3. ??? (I'm not sure, hoping this won't be a problem 

ZeroGS

So far, I find no dumping model functions in ZeroGS src. But ZeroGS perheps draws every face in view without considering the covering up stuff. So you can get a full rip of a person, with his back.
I cannot compile ZeroGS yet, for missing Zlib and sth. But there must be at least one problem:
Problem:
1. The scene looks odd perhaps in a view of perspective projection.
2. ...
Solution:
1. Non-linear transformation for the whole scene, from a perspective projection to a parallel one. But the algorithm REALLY SUCKS for me.

(TO DO: add up here;)


Extracting from ISO image/memory
Analysising/Reversing engineering formats

(quoted from invisghost's)
Furry fan and chrrox are amazing at reverse engineering formats. I know furry fan uses cheat engine to look at the memory of a program and get models from that (Although that seems like a lot of work). chrrox seems to do it the old fashion way and just figure out the format by looking at several files of the same type and looking for similarities. Just trying to say that you can have success with almost any method but you must be motivated and willing to learn very complicated systems.

Furryfan's method can avoid file encryption/compression, and may get raw model data (charactors in T-position).
But the only shortcomings - it's not applicable for everyone and every game, since each game/producer has its/his own style, and it's really hard for those unfamiliar with all sorts of 3D model variable styles and structures or lacking experience. I really want an alternative method applicable for ALL PS2 emulatable games XD ^^





PS:
I'm merely a newbie, but with Emulator open source and so many works done by others we can do more!
Days ago I just succeeded dumping NDS models, see this:

I know many of your have longlast will and sharp minds, plus PCSX2 & its GS plugins are open source!!
So why wouldn't you guys look into the case?!  i.e. motifying the GS plugin code, do the whole-space transformation, etc. I think they are feasible schemes to this subject.

what game is that on the ds?

did you just use OGLE to get the model?

No.
None of those ripping tools will work on any NDS emulator. Perhaps it's due to NDS OpenGL render are rewritten in some way that they cannot hook.

I just motified some code in the lastest DeSmuMe V0.97 svn, to write an .obj of current scene. Texture dumping were already done by someone else before.

So as u can c, I did almost nothing. It's DeSmuMe's author and other coders online who contributes, i was just going with the flow..

used the ZeroGS 0.97.1 plugin Default~

i tried and this is what i got~



ALSO i would like to note that even tho the UV's were fudged a little bit, i was able to fix them with a little work~

they were upside down and about 1/4 the size~ ( an Accurate guesstimation~)

Textures on the other hand were Messed up beyond repair~ they were like.... 8092 x 1 pixels. 

im still trying some stuff out atm~

Could u say how you fixed the UV and textures in more details,
or anyone know this, plz?

i mean how i can run the script? there is a option called run 
scripting  on the emulator but iam not sure if its that.

Good point szfzafa and good tutorial too, only the be clear this advance in DeSmuME (NDSemulator) its not for PS2 Games only to NDS games, but szfzafa tell the GSplugin its open source and can be modified, in the past mariokart64 post here its necesary forget any help from the GSplugins Original Developers, then the only way i see its found a man with the hability to modify the GSplugin.

This guide is very iffy as EVERY file is given the same header "MEM", this is unique to this game but not save states.
Here is the guide, please download, as viewing it in a web browser will warp the lines.

Since Rimbros gave me a link to files from disc, I'll write an exact guide that does not use "Furry Logic" (Fuzzy logic)
when I have time.

Really amazing guide thanks furryfan....so this should work with many ps2 games emulated in Pcsx2, right?
I will try it with with Zone of the enders 2 models,......extract these models are becoming my sweet obsession.

What I wrote in that file was specific to the game Saint Seyian only (however it is spelled), it would not work with any other game. The vast majority of a save state and ALL of the 32MB main RAM section are game and PS2 console specific and have nothing to do with an emulator. The Savestate does not know it is made by an emulator. You could take Saint Seyian savestates right from the console (probably need a modifed console) and use the same guide.

The models are from some Chinese site and the download rate is slow as kcuf!
But you can search their file names in "google" and find a 4shared one that is at their rates.

As i suppose you are talking about File/Lua script/new Lua script, then select the script and press "run", sadly the script will be stopped...

Hey guys,
One a previous post in this thread, someone stated they would be willing to rip models for people. I have shinkon gattai godannar, a mech fighting game, and I have been trying to rip models from it using 3d ripper DX and 3d via. I can't though, as I found out, because I can't use the ZeroGS KOSMOS plugin (My stupid computer has a crappy graphics card, which doesn't support pixelshader 2.0). Can someone get the models of the pink female mech and the purple female mech for me? The pink one you get automatically, and can rip it in the free battle mode. The purple one you have to unlock, by playing the story mode for a while. The game is in japanese, but it is easy to figure out. The main screen is set up like this:

Story Mode                       Free Battle Mode



Settings                         Memory Card

also, saving the game is simple:
pick yes on the first option when it comes up in story mode, then click yes again.

I know all of you are very busy, but would anyone have the time to do this for me? Thanks

Hi guys (and ladies, I don't know), nice to meet you, amazing stuff you have done here.

So if I understand well:
3Dvia can get nearly to flat meshes, they can be scaled but UV's are meshed up.
3Dripper get flat meshses but UV's usually tent to be more in order.

i mean how i can run the script? there is a option called run 
scripting  on the emulator but iam not sure if its that.

As i suppose you are talking about File/Lua script/new Lua script, then select the script and press "run", sadly the script will be stopped...

I found the "szfzafa" blog but i can't leave a message for now...

But is not a LUA script, you must download the src of DeSmune, after you decompress the .rar, search for these files:
texcache.cpp
gfx3d.h
gfx3d.cpp
their should be under this location: ...\DeSmune 2-7 src\trunk\desmume\src
Then you must modify with the mentioned code, and built the src, for this you may need a compiler.

Go [here](http://wiki.desmume.org/index.php?title=Installing_DeSmuME_from_source) for a bit of light about this  .

Thats what I do, however the emulator does not rip nothing for me, and after some rebuilds it just crash, there must be something that I am missing  .

This line for example: //#define DEBUG_DUMP_TEXTURE
is for dumb the textures but it only work when you have the Ogle render activated, that make the emulator crash(on mi PC).
It is comented on the szfzafa's code but it is comented too in the src, so there is not a real change in the file.
I would assume that it only post a part of the code, but I don't know  .

DarkScion:
I second the motion, I want those models too, but I'm gonna give it a try, lets to see what can I get, but you must give me some time, I need to find and get the game first, you could help posting a save file, that way I won't need to go through the game to unlock the model you want  .

Can anyone test the the latest unofficial build in this page please?
[http://www.emucr.com/](http://www.emucr.com/)
PCSX2 SVN r4515
I don't know if this version only support 64 bit OS or windowns7.I can't launch it in 32 bit XP system.
It just fail to launch,i tested from r4472 to r4515,none of them works for me.
Thx~:)

So, I just look into the the 3Dxml file that alon provide, and as expected it has deep and the perspective issue that szfzafa, SoftIce and others have say already, but the models are there, after somo fast an basic scaling I was able to get this:



I try with the whole set of modeling tools that blender provide to correct the perspective, but they were unefective for this purposes.

As you can see for the front and side views the legs are diferent in volume, this is more notorious on the other character on screen because his... ejem "DD's" looks way to diferent to each other, about the UV's, well, to say the less, their was destroyed, it was like see a chess board, and textures were like the others say, unproportional.

I am about to try the DX stuff to see how the thinks work, at least I could retrieve the textures and give them the "Rimbros" treatment to make them look properly.

Nice work, man... that means it is possible with this game   
If the textures are too screwed up, and you can't fix them, don't worry about it (if you can, though, that would be very cool). If there is no way to fix the textures, I can create textures for the meshes myself. Keep up the good work- I can't wait to see the rest of the mechs. Although, I need them in a format 3ds max can use, so if you could put them into .3ds or .obj, that would be great.
Thanks for your help

How to fix flat data?
3Dxml files store deep of the captures, you only need to aling the mesh until is "perpendicular" to an axis and then escale it on such axis (by 50 on Blender, you must be on edit mode), then you may want to do some extra scaling accord to the mesh you want, however, you are not goin to get a good model only doing this, the picture above does not show this too much but in front view the left side is more tiny than the right side due to a perspective issue that remains after the capture.

Using this method, is possible with every game, as long they can run on the emulator, the problem is that the scene is saved exactly as it appears on the screen, farthest faces are tiny, while nearest ones are big, even if they are part of the same mesh.

The textures are not the problem, they can be easily extracted with wrong colors that can be repaired folowing [this](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?p=46979#p46979), the problem are the UV's of the model, but actually I make a capture with 3Dripper, the mesh is totally flat so there is no hope for those meshes, but the UV's are good enought, so I hope that I can fix them and then move them to the mesh I got from the 3Dxml.

Of course I can take the other way like FurryFan or szfzafa did, but for now I'll be doing this the "easy" way.

So, in resume:
-Get mesh from 3Dvia
-Get UV from 3Dripper
-Pass UV to mesh.
-Find a way to correct perspective issue.
-Rig.
-Export.
-Eat a donut.
-Upload archive here.

 By the way, while I was doing a "gameplay test", I come a cross with someting that you may want to get riped too, here, a wireframe of what I'm talkin about.

Awesome. I would definitely love to also get my hands on the pilots, too, specifically the pilots of the three mechs I listed above. Remember that you can rip the mechs easier in the victory screen of the vs. mode, where for a few seconds you see the entire front of the mech (I assume, since it is 3dvia you are using, it will capture the back as well). If you have a front view, you won't have any skewing, and scaling it will be very easy. Can't wait to see the other mechs rendered (specifically Volspina, that mech looks awesome).
Thanks

Me too.

Ok, click in the computer button that your pic shows, the one with the green/red edge, a pop up window will appear, find a option which says "open file", continue happily   

You both may want to check [this](http://ps23dformat.wikispaces.com/), the FurryFan's wiki, use the search function on the top left to find treads as some pages are not displayed on the main menu.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   Ok, something strange hapen in the morning, while I was trying to get some captures whith 3Dvia, the entire screen covers up in black and gradually turns to white, after this the emulator crashes when i try to run it with 3dvia, afther a hour or so I was able to run the emulator with 3dvia but it crashes when I try to get a capture.
   So, by now I'm going to focus in correct the UV's of Neo Okusaer, while I try to figure out what the hell happens with the emulator.

Hmmm... data corruption. Try reinstalling PCSX2 and all the extra stuff you got for it. I don't know if its possible, but maybe 3dvia is corrupting the data feed when it rips the meshes?

Well, that was one of the first things I do trying to solve the problem, but it didn't fix it  , so after tree days of trying to make the emulator runs with 3Dvia, nothing  , even worse, the emulator doesn't want to run any game now  , so I give up the ripping method (for now) a begun to search in the hex editor, found what I believe is the directory and some 3d data (I suppose it is), but I'm not good at this as FurryFan, so any help would be welcome.

Damn.... that stinks. I can't really give you much help beyond this point, I don't know anything about hex editing. Anyway, keep us posted on your findings- Im sure it will all work out in the end. Another thing nobody has really tried is cracking the .pac format that the models are hidden in, in the actual game files. People say it is impossible, but I disagree.

Oh, actually is very easy, those *.pac files contains several types of files, and those are very easy to extrac, but there is a type of file among the others, a *.lzs file which encription/compresion metod is not the regular one, so in order to get the real file, you need to figure out the metod they use on such files, that are the ones that suposedly contains the 3D models.
   So is more easy to get the data from a save state, actually you can get the model, the bones, the texture, and even the animation files, and since I'm searching for all those tings, thats why I prefer to do it in this way rather than search in the game it self.

Sounds good. Keep me posted on how it goes. Although, someone should try to crack the .lzs format, just to make it easier for people who intend to reverse engineer the game.

- is it possible with using savestate to receive .obj file of it?
- is there possible way opening .nds files?
- where to find the last version of NSBMD tool?

Thank you very much, and sorry for the little off-topic. If anyone does know where to find all that stuff, let me know.

It is technically possible to extract models and textures, even animations, from any save state. However, the problem is interpreting the data in the save state. I would make a separate thread on the topic you mentioned, and I'm sure a bunch of like-minded people will help you out.

So after a few days of try and fail, I give up with the hex, I am quite sure were the model data is, not about what model is but is 3d data for sure, but without the knowledge to manage it is useles to try something; the good new is that the emulator read the games again, so I'm goin to do some stuff in this tonight.

@RacingFreak
- is it possible with using savestate to receive .obj file of it?
   Basically you took 3d data from the file an manually transform in some other format you like, so basically yes, it is posible, but you must know what are you doing, so is a bit har to try.
- is there possible way opening .nds files?
   Yes, search for "DS Lazy" or "NDS Editor" (without quotes) it will allow you to unpack all the files in any NDS file, but the files vary from game to game, you may get raw data from some games as Mario Kart, or get encrypted and/or compressed data from other games, it depends on the company that makes the game.

Thanks mates! I`ve got all that and pretty much worked well, I`ve basicly needed some textures and then if possible models, but the models are usually crappy looking (I mean in NDS racing games).

Now I have question... could it be possible to rip models and especially textures from PCSX2 and PCSX2 savestates? If there`s something with HEX and savestates from PCSX2, that will be great. I`ll try using Rimbros`s settings and will ask for help later

Yes u can (not always)....and yes even for the second question. The point is that it's depends from game to game as inferrry said for nds games.
The savestate generally have all you need (raw data in which you can find textures and meshes in t-pose) but in this case you have to extract them (not rip) with an hex editor or cheat engine, but obviously you need to what to do.

Thank you very much, and sorry for the little off-topic. If anyone does know where to find all that stuff, let me know.

As far as I know, NSBMD tool was written on the limited understanding of the file format, on the author's won. There are many cases in fact that, you can get .nsbmd files for sure, but the tool will turn your meshes in a mess, like cull faces with textures missing/inside out/wrong scales, or the shape is totally a mess.

The best way to get a fine model from NDS at this moment is to dump.

I hope we don't go too far away from the topic, getting PS2 models. I mentioned NDS just for an example.

If you search back you will find a guide that FurryFan made to rip from a save state of pcsx2 from a game of saint seya, the exact steps only work on this game, but some hints are useful wen triying to rip from other games, you can also check his blog.

@szfzafa
Well that will be one of two solutions.
Make a script to reescale the vertex in funtion of the distance to the front along an axis, or mod the plugin to make an orthogonal proyection of the scene, which is more dificult, but those are not in my posibilities, so I been reading around in order to make a script to make the scaling stuff.

Your diagrams are revealing to me, they give me some ideas, but I need to learn a bit more of pyton scripting to make something meaningful or useful.

And talking of DS, I been triying to make some dumping but the best I can get is vertex data and nothing else, actually you are the first person I know to been able to do it properly.

Ps: By the way what is the name of the character on your avatar?

Im trying to rip some models from .Hack//GU Vol 2......I have 3d ripper dx, 3d max, pcsx2, and the iso of the game and I've been researching but no where explains what I do to start out....I tried opening pcsx2 with 3d ripper dx but says I dont have the required plugin, so I opened pcsx2 and then ran 3d ripper dx and browsed for the pcsx2 and it closed when I launched so I went to the game and pressed my capture key and it asked to save a .avi? So I did, But Im sure Im going the wrong direction with this.

Sorry for the bumpage, but how can I paste the code to gfx3d.cpp? Whenever I try to compile it on VC2008 it tells me that some stuff in the code is declared as illegal or something.

EDIT: Tried moving it to a seemingly appropriate section of the file but still I get compile errors.

in recent days I just found ZeroGS culls backfaces as well!!
This will happen in MANY games, while OTHERS NOT, which means it's impossible for 3DVia Ripping to be an alternative method for every PS2 game.

As for the projection, i came up with an idea.
Suppose a vector (x0,y0,z0) in the origin scene turned out to be (x,y,z) in the ripped scene.
taking it for an example, the COP(centre of projection) is at (x',y',z'),
then:
x0 = a*(x - x')
y0 = b*(y - y')/(x - x')
z0 = c*(z - z')/(x - x')
It's simple.
Not tried yet.

sorry for the bump, since it's really old.
i'm interested in this thread cause i tried to do same thing,i.e. modding pcsx2 source for model dump.
i failed, cause I got dumped vertex with all z == zero, I surrendered.

now that this thread told me z can be scaled to correct value.
strange! I've made some mistake before!? 

ps:any progress on it?

i found my old working files, you guy's are right: they're polygons after projection(the game for test is 'metal sage'). If I can get camera's parameter(or just by guess), may be the original model can be calculated.
I'll try it later if i have some time. 

another question:
did any one come cross a game renders like this:
1st render scene to texture
2nd do bloom or HDR over the texture
3rd render the texture to screen
just want to know can this kind of game be able to dump, just wonder,

Since you guys know about functions and hexedit why don't you try this tutorial?

Have you tried the method that site explained?
I still believe in the power of reverse engineering, although I'm a novice about it.
