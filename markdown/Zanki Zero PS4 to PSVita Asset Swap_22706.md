- Post Title: Zanki Zero PS4 to PSVita Asset Swap

I'm trying to do exactly what the subjects says. I successfully unpacked everything from the ps4 .pkg and extracted the .psarc and the files inside. But... I'm stuck at this file extensions and how to edit/open them, I don't know what else to do, I have used HxD, NP++, Scarlet, GXT extractor, etc. It seems I can't do anything to them :/ this is the structure and extensions of the files I'm dealing with.

PS4 files

/table folders
.mbb
.mbb.enus
.mbb.zhtw
.tbb
.tbb.enus
.tbb.zhtw
.stbb
.stbb.enus
.stbb.zhtw
/font folder
.tpc
/ui folder
.gtx
.tpc

PSVita files
/table folder
.mbb
.tbb
.stbb
/font folder
.tpc
/ui folder
.gtx
.tpc

The /table folder files seems to do nothing (?) /font folder files changed almost all text to blank/glitched spaces (maybe type of font? or actual text/dialogue?) and some of the /ui/ folders files changed almost all icons to black squares, at least I'm getting somewhere but still can't figure out the text/dialogue location/edition :/
