- Post Title: Gegege no Kitarou: Gyakushuu! Youkai Daichise FAD file (PSX)

A little platformer for the playstation console. I did a bit of digging but I'm unable to figure out the data content. I do know however there is some form of sound, music, and graphics all in this FAD file, the format seems to be different from other PSX titles however uncompressed it seems, the contained files do not seem to match any specifications for sound nor graphic data (I used different tools, all either got garbage files or nothing at all). Sorry if I seem to ask alot but I get interested easy when I get a new game, especially when they are old.

There's the file, it is not very big.

I'm suprised MegaUpload still has it hosted it. O_o Definetly better than that other service for sure.

Anybody find anything in this? Interested in any results you may have. Sorry for the bump btw.
