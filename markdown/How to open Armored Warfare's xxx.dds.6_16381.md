Okay i actually downloaded the game and checked.
나는 게임을 다운로드했어. 

You have to unpack the normal texture packages: textures-0000.pak - textures-0039.pak too. You will find more files for object-640_guns_d.dds, files .0 to .5.
텍스처 패키지의 압축을 풀어야하세요: textures-0000.pak - textures-0039.pak. 거기에서 object-640_guns_d.dds 파일, .0부터 .5까지 파일들을 더 찾을 수 있어.

Copy your .6 file in this folder.
이 폴더에 .6 파일을 복사하세요.

Download [http://sktest.aruarose.com/DDSUnsplit.7z](http://sktest.aruarose.com/DDSUnsplit.7z) and put into that folder too.
[http://sktest.aruarose.com/DDSUnsplit.7z을](http://sktest.aruarose.com/DDSUnsplit.7z%EC%9D%84) 다운로드하고 폴더에 복사하세요.

Run UnsplitAllDDS.bat.
UnsplitAllDDS.bat를 사용하세요.

Your folder in the end should look like this:
폴더는 이와 같아야해요:

It will give you a .dds file you can open in an image editor!
이미지 편집기에서 열 수있는 .dds 파일을 제공해요!
