Hi, I would like to know how could I rip the character models of this game, there was a similar topic like this but it was back in 2011, and it included something about a MaxScript, and fixing something that most of the links are dead.

I suppose it's the PLAYER.AFS file, where the characters are located, I couldn't figure it out how to extract its content.

My knowledge: not too much, 2 years ago I tried Noesis, searched a plugin to open an extension so I could extract some Dragon Ball models. And since I reformated pc twice, I have no trace of what I did, but I remember I succeded. I suppose with the right programs/plugins it's not too hard... right?.

[UPDATE] 
#1:Been able to extract them, they extracted as dff.pak and txd.pak, reminds me of gta's model and texture system, but doesn't actually end up with .txd/dff.

#2:From what I've seen, the only thing I would need to know it's how to use this [http://puu.sh/arBgb.txt](http://puu.sh/arBgb.txt) , It's a code, but I have no idea how or where to use it. I've been able to install Fatduck's importer, and I do believe that code adds a, game to the list of thing it can export? I don't know, please help.

Thanks for passing by.

You need to unpack afs to pak
using   afs unpaker

subsequently using a script by Fat Duck

As I stated on the topic, I did extract them, but I couldn't find that script by that Fat Duck
