Please browse for SELECT UNPACKED GAME DIR.
It is important because script read all needed textures and convert they to .dds format else script break.
Next time please check console and send screen of console.
Some model give  errors, because file format of witcher 2 is still unknow in 100%.

Try Blender version 249 not 25.
All my scripts are for 249 version and use Python version 2.6 (not 3.0).

Edit: I assume the script does not support exporting back to w2ent format at this point?

When I click LOAD for textures nothing happens.

Check your unpacked game dir, (I use chrrox bms script for unpacking pack0.dzip) 
and load *.w2ent model.

I have unpacked pack0.dzip with Gibbed's RED Tool ([http://www.witchernexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=52](http://www.witchernexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=52))
And all seem to be fine until textures.

1. All folders are correctly set 
2. I can import *.w2ent (head, body, etc)
3. I can see the model in 3D
4. I can see textures on Left and I can load textures on the most right panel (Default layout)
5. But I cannot make Blender to cover model with texture (when I click LOAD for Textures - LOAD and EXIT buttons are available - nothing happens)

Thank you Szkaradek123 and chrrox for the awesome scripts.
@ RobeN, load textures manually, to find them...
Go to the character folder
Click the search button
Click on all files and folders
Type ".dds" without quotes in the first typing field
Click search
All the .dds textures you ever loaded in blender should pop up, now find the ones that correspond to the character you loaded.

Correct me if I'm wrong Szkaradek123.

If textures doesn't apply auto then you must apply them from the UV Image/Editor.

Right. I am getting a script error, LOL.

Says to check the the console and the console says that there is no module named "Blender (without quotation marks), error at line 4.

Also I fixed the error with print word: LOL apparently 2.5 versions need to have print = instead of print [Whatever you wanna print].

Please note that I am an absolute noob to Blender (just installed it for the first time today XD), so please tell what to do in detail if you can.

I haven't encountered that particular problem but, as Szkaradek pointed out, you need to use Blender 2.49 and NOT Blender 2.5. Make sure you're using Python 2.6 too.

Thanks, almost complete, only you need to parent them manual but that ain't hard. 

About the material support, something is weird, if you assign the hair texture, it covers the body also, and vice versa, bug or just I'm doing something wrong?  From UV/Image Editor doesn't take effect only from the panel.

A small workaround for this is to go under material buttons and make  a single user for the selected mesh then reapply texture.



Also Great job Szkaradek123,

I hope you continue your work on this script because this game is AWESOME and Please, Please consider animation support for .w2cutscene

you have to open the script through the scripts windows in blender. then you have to select the unpacked game directory as the entirety of pack0. i made the mistake of directing it to the location of the texture.

open only .blend file, after opening .blend file script opens automatically, you need only right-mouse-btn on the script window and Executing it!

for me it work just fine:

i always thought these w2ent were more like reference files and that the model data was stored elsewhere, but it seems all of the mesh data is inside of these files.

are these more suited to be exported/imported within the environment of a resource editor? cause there must be some settings that need to be controlled outside of a modeling program.

do you know if rigging is done per model or via the engine itself? i looked at the male models and they all seem to have the same bone structure. would enabling a model for use as a player model replacement be as simple as changing a line or is more complex than that?

First off I want to thank Szkaradek123 as I was really looking forward to being able to work with the in game models. After some time, I managed to get everyhting working. That being said, I dont know if its because I'm new to blender or if you just havnt implemented it yet, but I can't seem to get the rigging working. I really want to be able to animate these models as right now there int a whole lot I can do with them in their static state.
Once again, Thanks

Actually the bones import perfectly, all you need to to is to parent them, remove doubles, make some of then to not deform the mesh, esp the ones tagged with roll.

ok, so the bones in fact are all there but like CMihai said they need to be parented. The bones are all positioned in the correct spots but they are not connected. After playing around for a while and trying to find a tutorial on how to do it, I just couldnt connect them. In case this information isnt descriptive enough, I attached a picture below to demonstrate what I mean. 
Thanks

Why not make this script for 2.5x versions? It doesn't look like you need to modify it a lot, just add "=" after "print" and I think there was something else... Can't remember it now though. Anyway script still doesn't work. When I press "Show what w2ent file has" nothing displays.

It takes a lot of time to parent all the bones on the models I open and on top of that when I'm done they still need a lot of tweaking that I am not capable of doing (having never done animation before). To be honest, I dont even mind parenting the bones even though its tedious, its just the strange connections they make that I have an issue with. The joints bend in ways they should not (especially roll joints such as the elbows) and there is quite a bit of mesh stretching going on when ever I move them. I really hope that Im not wishing for too much. Either way I want to thank you for want you've done so far. Keep up the great work!

Yea some of the have forearm/elbowroll used, depends, but as a quick note, you can use one bone structure for most of the characters, for Geralt of example I used only one, for like 5-6 models and works fine, I also did Iorweth minutes ago and same, worked fine, so just save the .blend for reuse, the only one that didn't worked so far was Letho, and ofc Zoltan wich both of them have a different scale, but as far I seen, it should work for Letho also, guess I just missed something, should work fine. 

About the arms I'm doing this way

->Bicep2
-->Bicep
-->ShoulderRoll
--->Forearm/Elbowroll
----->Forearmroll1
------->Forearmroll2
--------->Handroll
----------->Hand

And from now you shouldn't have any troubles. Same for legs

->Thigh
-->LegRoll1
-->LegRoll2
---->Shin
------>KneeRoll
-------->Foot
---------->Toe

Hi all 

First of all, nice script. I have a few questions:

1. What is exactly the "UNPACKED GAME DIR"? I have unpacked pack0.dzip with Gibbed's RED Tool to a folder. I set this folder as the "UNPACKED GAME DIR" but i get an error. The other folder is ok: I can see .w3ent files. What should i do?

2. Should i use the "chrrox bms script" for unpacking pack0.dzip. If yes, where can i dowload it?

3. Can i use the script and Blender to export the models? I don't like TW1 Triss model , so I would like to use the Witcher 2 Triss model in the Witcher 1 (if it's possible xD).

Thanks in advance!

Cheers!

Hi,

Does anybody know where *.w2mesh files in Witcher 2 are? Aren't they coded in the *.w2ents?

Sorry for my noob question, but I can't find solution myself

Thanks

Depends, not all .w2mesh are into w2ent files, but if the w2ent contains w2mesh the importer will open the package and you can select those.

Hell yeah! Great Work! I have only one question: How to export all of it in 3ds max without quality-loosing (in fact in UDK but it would be good to work with meshes in 3d max before)

To get the models into max, I recommend you use the md5mesh exporter. I have by far the best results with crossimporting between blender and max with that.

After that you should be able to do max>FBX>UDK

Hmm, it's kinda interesting, first attemp to extract models i've seen. 
But i'm quite annoyed with this, first of all, i used to use 3dsmax and not Blender so i'm quite bad with it.
And i am the only one who haven't that browse interface for importing the models and textures ? (when i open the .blend i've got the script only and a new space for modeling at left)
i can't get that page :



Do u have any clues ? Is there any ways i can get this browser ?

Hi Kjun,

I had the same issue seeing as I'm a Blender newb too. All you have to do is hit "Alt"+P, and the browser will open. Several of Szkaradek123 scripts work that way. From there, you export to a few formats that Max supports. Good luck!

First thx for reply,

And second , i have the error "python script error : check console" when i try to Alt+P, and i think this error occured when u do not import the files, am i wrong ? 

So i'm trying to imort and i do not find the browser ><". Maybe i didn't understand a part of this manipulation.

Would help us more to see the console...that DOS window which shows up while you open Blender.

Okay so, no reply on my previous post.

Hopefully someone can help with this one?

Almost every model I've tried loads fine with usually only minor issues, but one problem I have with all models is the armature loads with the tail end of the bones off to the side and not in alignment with the mesh. I'm not sure how to describe it well so here is a pic.



Can someone please tell me how I can Fix this in blender or possibly obtain an updated script which will correct the problem?

Not knowing how Gibbed tools unpacks the files best I can give you is this.

pack0.dzip\game\npc\riszon.w2ent  is where I found the "richon__body1_b1.w2mesh" and other files that hold the model info.

HTH

Aha, so there's that big burly bastard,   

I tried searching every name (Witcher, Letho, Assassin, Kingslayer) and never had a clue about that one.

Thanks a Bunch MichaelDarkAngel.

Hello,

I'm still hoping for a solution to the rig problem from my previous post because I'm trying to create my own armature based on the original bone placement but, this problem makes that almost impossible.

If anybody has even an idea about this issue please tell.


[Edit] I know nothing about Python but, I'll take a wild guess and say maybe the problem lies within this piece of code.




Any Blender Python People around?

Sorry to bring up an old topic, but I was really Hoping that the blender script could be updated/improved for the Witcher 2 Models.
The reason I mention it is because as many of you may know, CDProjekt  has just recently released RedKit for Modding The Witcher 2, but it currently has no functionality for importing/exporting Skeletal Meshes.

The only capabilities ATM are exporting static object meshes from the editor in .3ds, .obj and .fbx formats (You cannot export any Character Models, NPCs or Otherwise).
There is also an included plugin for 3DS Max 2009 and 2013 which only Exports in .re static mesh format.

I have made requests on the RedKit forums for blender I/O but apparently they are quite busy with many other things currently such as Witcher 3, Cyberpunk 2077, not to mention RedKit itself (bugfixes,website, etc...).

Someone with Python skills here shouldn't have much trouble improving on an this nearly complete and very good Importer for blender.

The Features that are mainly needed are bone improvements, and animation support.

Thanks

Please make the script. where one can select meshes in a folder.w2mesh to load..no need to open w2ent file.
TK for the import script.

Reason is the different data format of standalone w2mesh and meshes in a w2ent entity container:

q102_elf_woman_hanger.w2ent which is 5.22 MB of size with 
scoiatael_woman__body1_b1 included:

# L:\tmp\q102_elf_woman_hanger.w2ent
# 8292 face Indices
# 1.   e0d2d:
v 0.178874 -0.028297 1.424668
# 00 01 02 03  92 4F 19 04  86 00 80 FF  
# FF FF FF FF  
vt 0.348128 0.709508
# 17.887421 4.690230
# DE 84 2A FF  D4 85 DE FF  

and this is the same mesh standalone, 873kB 

# L:\tmp\scoiatael_woman__body1_b1.w2mesh
# 8292 face Indices
# 1.     759:
v 0.178874 -0.028297 1.424668
# 00 01 02 03  0.574310 0.310812 0.098458 0.016420 0.055559 -0.998417 0.008791 
# FF FF FF FF  

As can be seen the data structure is somewhat different.

You can get all the meshes you need using Szkaradek's script.

I don't think someone will bother creating a new script just for sake of comfort.

For the record, the latest version of this script works, I think like 1-2 pages back and for models that say error if you use the new script and hit magic it will work some reason, mainly the body meshes. Good job if the person is still alive.

The problem is, we can't export the meshes anywhere using such an old version of blender. I used source and I can't export as .smd which is like the only format in the world that includes a mesh + a skeleton

I've been searching for an hour to find a 2.49 smd exporter but failed to find anything. This doesn't work in newer versions of blender...

I heard of .dae exporting skeletons but it only exports like several bones and I exported a .obj, and the obj didnt recognize the .dae when i parented the skeleton to it, notably due to the missing bones.

maybe you need to install additional tools for using blender, such us Python v2.6.5 and PyFFI
I made the same, but still get an error, whats wrong am I doing?
