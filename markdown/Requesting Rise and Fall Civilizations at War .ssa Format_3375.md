Hi Guys ! i Have This Game Rise and Fall: Civilizations at War and i want you to take a look at the data.ssa file, the original full archive is about 757 MB, i think i contains textures and objects (the sounds and the musics,movies are outside the archive in folders named movies , music ,sounds ) i don't know much about the demo, Here is some info might help you (Please Help!) (and maybe you want to add its format to multiex commander   and game extractor )

interesting, I have just written a tool which works with all the SSA files of the various games of Stainless Steel included this one.
I have only a doubt about the xor key used in the retail game so if you have the full game please upload here the first 1000 bytes of data.ssa

luckily I found a good mirror where downloading the free retail game (2 giga and half!!!) and so I have done all the needed remaining checks.
the tool which works with Empire Earth, Empires: Dawn of the Modern World and Rise and Fall: Civilizations at War (both demo and retail) is available here:
