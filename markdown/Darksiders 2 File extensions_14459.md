I also would have needed help .. there are problems with models especially with cotrutti who do not have the skeleton! I discovered that the .o3d files are the files that contain the script skeleton code. Now we should try to use the scripts of zaramot for 3d studio max and let him know to load the skeleton with the model and it should work in theory.
