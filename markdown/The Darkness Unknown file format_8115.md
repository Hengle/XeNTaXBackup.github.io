- Post Title: The Darkness "Unknown" file format

Hi, I have recently ripped files from the darkness and came out with files and it says that there file type is "Unknown" I can open any one of them with windows media player and hear it audibly, I wish to convert the files into wav for future endeavors. A sample can be found here [http://www.mediafire.com/?upc430663pys62b](http://www.mediafire.com/?upc430663pys62b) If you would kindly help me I will greatly appreciate it.

The file you uploaded doesn't have a valid stream start. Where exactly did it come from?

XB360 version, the same result still came from PC version...the extraction of all files was no problem, converting never worked out though...so I resorted to obtaining the XB360 version and trying on that, but like I said...

But there is "The Darkness II"    , if this topic was for the first original game which came for the XB360...then I guess partly the second game was still functional in extracting the files, but not streaming as of yet...?

I'm running into the same issue FinalBlast is having, but only with files that have to do with dialogue and only to a certain extent. Final, the file you uploaded has dialogue in it which seems to be why it doesn't have the proper start to a streaming audio file like Alpha said. However, the correct audio files (Pure BGM) can be played back and converted just not in a traditional way. You need an Audio Editor like Audacity or Goldwave then import the file as raw audio. The specifications for said import are auto-detected correctly if you have a pure BGM file, if the import tool says its properties are anything other than signed 16-bit PCM, you don't have the right type of file. And now a few side-notes.

1) Final, if you have any further troubles either PM me or just reply to the topic.

2)To anyone else reading this, I am dying to get these dialogue related files to playback in any way possible and I'm unsure if it had something to do with aluigi's script for this game or if the dialogue files are encrypted somehow. Any help towards my dilemma would be greatly appreciated.

Ah, you see, I only wish to extract the dialogue myself too, the BGM part I just tried, worked fine, still not what I really want though, let us pray someone will find a way eventually.

Really? Nobody knows how to fix/play these files? Then again, these files are looking way too small to contain any type of audio. I'm starting to think something in aluigi's extraction script needs to be updated or fixed as that script was made fir the demo which had incomplete folder structures according to him because some people are reporting getting corrupted  png files from these archives as well.
