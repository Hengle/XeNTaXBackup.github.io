- Post Title: [HELP] FIFA17 .Cat and .Cas Files

Hi guys, FIFA17 released and you know EA Games used Frostbite 3 Engine for FIFA this year. We couldnt open new .cas and .cat files, I searched and found so many scripts at here for other frostbite 3 engine games (bf4,starwars e.t.c), but it doesnt work for FIFA17. We need your helps, please help us. Thanks
