- Post Title: (PS2)Family Guy: The Video Game, external directory archive

Hello everybody  , I was not all that impressed with the Family Guy video game except for the music within it which is why I am trying to rip the soundtrack from a HUGE single file (nearly 3gb.) What intrigues me is that it is called GAME.wad (real original) next to a GAME.dir file. I've looked into the game.dir file and it seems to contain the names of the files I'm looking for (pss streams). However no ripping or extracting programs have worked(ex.MultiEx.) So ANY help with these two files and there relationship would be helpful. Also, if it helps, the game was developed by High Voltage Software and published by 2K Games.

EDIT: Upon further research on this site's wiki I found out what I'm looking at is an external directory archive and I looked upon the example layout but I'm having trouble finding the corresponding offsets and file sizes to the files listed in the directory file. I will upload the directory and a cut of the archive now.
