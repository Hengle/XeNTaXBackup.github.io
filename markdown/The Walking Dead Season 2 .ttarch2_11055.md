- Post Title: The Walking Dead Season 2 .ttarch2

Hello.

The Walking Dead have a new file format ".ttarch2". I've rename it to .ttarch and try to open it with the telltale explorer but
that doesnt work 

Can somebody tell me more about it? Or even better: how can I open it ?

And what does this "key" do? oO
I want to extract the .ttarch2 files not .font and not .landb.
