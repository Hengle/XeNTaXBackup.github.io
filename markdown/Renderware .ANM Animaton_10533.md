- Post Title: Renderware .ANM Animaton

I've been trying to view the animation files for Spongebob Battle for Bikini Bottom. The game uses normal Renderware formats, and I'm able to get the models with bones and everything with Kam's Max Scripts, but not the animations. Many other Renderware games use .anm, so I'm sure a script will be great for general use.

Here's some samples along with a model:

I'm not too sure though, as R* seems to have done some modifications to the RW file formats, although from what it seems it's pretty much the same banana across most RW 3.xx games.
