- Post Title: PvZ Popcap animation files.

Hello fine folks. I can't tell you how important these files are to me and their decompiling is crucial to my project. I hope someone can figure out what's going on with these. They are compiled animation files from Popcap's epic game, Plants VS Zombies. The thing is, though the components are easily extracted from the main.pak file, they are nigh-impossible to assemble properly and animate correctly. These files I assume contain the already compiled and animated images needed. I assume they're just altered common files such as SWFs. Could someone please give these a look and let me know how to access them. Mind you a similar method is used in other Popcap games, and whoever finds the method to unlocking these files will be doing a great service to the community.

Contained in the following RAR file are folders with the files inside. Take you pick from them to experiment on.
