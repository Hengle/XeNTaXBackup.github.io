- Post Title: Darkstalkers 3 ARC file (PSX)

I have scanned through the ARC file (ARC short for Archive?) several ways and I'm uncertain, I see graphics are not compressed, uncertain of format though. I've been tinkering with it to the point I am quite curious what is all in it. I will provide a link to the file here:

If the graphics format can be figured out too it would be great. Thanks for your time.
