This is great! Been looking for over an hour for the character skins. Do you remember which package file had Ellie's one? I found a what looked like the right pak files (char-level-ellie.pak etc) but they're sub 1k (300bytes) and wont open in Noesis. Been able to open a lot of environment textures though which is cool. Does the python script need more work to read the mesh data? Thanks for this!

EDIT: Spoke too soon.. in case it helps someone else - they're in the Actor34.psarc file. Awesome!

It looks like only textures are currently available and work on a custom model extractor is needed.

Yeah, they should compress the model so that no one can touch it easily, I believe the compression is the built in compressor for 3dsmax, but still need to take a look on the model first, the game itself is huge, may be the biggest PS3 games currently, so it should be somewhere the folder contain all the models.

Please can anyone explain the pak file structure a bit  ?
I read on some posts that in the beginning of pak file is some offset relocation table...

      info3 = []
	bs.seek(info2[1], NOESEEK_ABS)
	for a in range(0, info2[2]):
		info3.append(bs.read(">2I"))
	#for a in range(0, info2[2]):
	#	print(("0x%0.10X" % info3[a][1]))

does info3 have anything with that offsets?

In chrrox script "VRAM_DESC" is for textures... maybe GEOMETRY_1 is for verts

how to find mesh...verts... faces...bones...

If anyone knows?

Cheers!!!
