- Post Title: Combining H and B lua files for Warframe

Hi All, 
I recently got into looking into the warframe .cache files and noticed that in the script folders there was alot of lua files.
However all of these files seem somewhat unreadable as some words are coherent but are separated by tangents of symbols.
After looking around the forum I found the warframe sound converter that combines the audio into actual data however that doesn't work with .lua (go figure). Is there some program that would be able to combine these files?  Thanks!
