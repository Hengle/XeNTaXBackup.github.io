- Post Title: Vietcong Official Update !!

Hi there Mr.Mouse:!: 

The publisher of Vietcong has released an editor tool for the CBF files.
I dont know if that is enough for an MC support , but I hope.

Please check this out, perhaps you can find in the tool the exact logarithm to editing the CBF file format.

Here is the link where you can grab the tool:

If you need a CBF file I uploaded one from the program's directory to my ftp (1.8MB):
