- Post Title: Ability to resign original Xbox game saves to be released

Since Microsoft has stopped support of XBL for original Xbox titles, I will be releasing a program later that will allow you to get the AuthKey of ANY original Xbox game.  This will allow you to be able to resign original Xbox saves by using xSavSig as long as you have the correct info for the ini file.  By using the XboxSaveParser Program on my site, it will help you find the correct ini entries for XSavSig.  I used to never release AuthKeys for XBL enabled Xbox games, but since Microsoft has disabled XBL service for these games, there is no point in not letting everyone that still uses the original Xbox be able to get an AuthKey so they have the ability to resign the saves.  Stay tuned for more details.
