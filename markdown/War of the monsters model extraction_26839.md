- Post Title: War of the monsters model extraction

Hello! I'm in need of some assistance, I've had the files for War of the Monsters for a while now but I cannot open them, I tried Model Researcher, cannot seem to get Hex to Obj anymore, I tried using a tool made for Twisted Model (The same devs as WOTM) and nothing worked, please help me.

I don't know which one, I tried the 2012 one, which tools are there otherwise?


Edit: I tried Twisted Toolkit, one just called "tm2012" but neither of them worked.

I think twisted Metal black IS the closest one.
However i did Not succeed in extracting war of the monsters Models with Tools available online.

Downhill Domination shares a similar Filetype, though:

I tried Offzip but it keeps crashing, I can't even do a thing with it, I tried dragging it on, opening it up only for it to instantly close until I open it enough times to not get it to crash, and even then a simple click causes it to crash,I can't seem to find an official source for Offzip, I tried Hex2Obj Mesh Extractor, but it's only the exe and missing a couple of files that go with it.

Here are a few of the files, Alien is a player called Zorgulon, Assboss is the first boss of the game, Final is... Final boss, and Jelly is a presumably unused model.

I tried Hex2Obj Mesh Extractor, but it's only the exe and missing a couple of files that go with it.This happens when people don't read posts concentrated.

I actually did not see your thread originally, I kept finding completely irrelevant ones, save for a thread, I took a look so far and I'll try to use it when I can, thank you!

It's possible to get results from these .NGP files in  the Jun 13 upload (which are NOT compressed) but the question is: is it worth it?
.

Example H2O file (switch to PtCld, i.e. point cloud):

0x1978C 184

0x0 255

(In FINALE.NGP search for signatue B500xx6C (where xx is a wildcard) to find the start of vertices after it.)
