- Post Title: Revue Starlight Re LIVE model conversion

Hello, I'm looking for some help with model conversion from this mobile game

I've managed to extract the files for a model and had a look at the headers in case there was any existing tool to convert to a format I can open in a program, but I could not find anything useful. The model files from what I saw at least have a BIX header and seem to have all their meshes labelled clearly, however my experience in this matter ends there.

[https://mega.nz/#!XeAWWIYD!819yjvDBhO0D ... ejlJyQCvNI](https://mega.nz/#!XeAWWIYD!819yjvDBhO0D2YZdVxB8MgvfzgCiYeTw9ejlJyQCvNI)
Here is one of the models from the game along with textures that I have managed to convert just fine. I'm not altogether sure what other files could be useful but I can probably provide whatever is needed.

Any help at all would be appreciated!
