Okay,here's what i do:
1.demuxing the sfd using video demultiplex tools in vgmtoolbox,got m2v and adx file
2.convert the adx file to wav using pes sound converter
3.muxing into mkv using tmpgenc video mastering works 5,i use simple multiplexing in mpeg tools section,the result is normal and proper video color.no specific setting.
i havent tried it using other software,so i dont have an alternative for tmpgenc video mastering works.
