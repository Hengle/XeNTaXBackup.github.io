- Post Title: [.KWN] Asterix & Obelix XXL

Hello,
I play the game "Asterix & Obelix XXL" and want to extract the model and animation files.
The most files are in *.kwn. Can anyone analyze the following example-files?

[https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B1G0Dp ... sp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B1G0Dp4EJRa2NEEwUGgzWERjVkU/view?usp=sharing)

The files which I added are "LVL01.KWN" "STR01_0x.KWN".

LVL01.KWN is the "Level 1 (gaul)" what sould include:
-Models
-Animations
-Textures
-Sounds (no music, no voice)

STR01_0x.KWN. The level is separated in 4 parts, so that it looks like ONE big level.
It could be that there are only the levelmodels.


For more informations post here.   

P.S.: In the gamefolder EVERY level use his own folder with the informations, models it needs.
So if a background-music is used in three levels, it is copied in the three folders. Silly!  

And I have the files for the GameCube and PS2 version. Who need it, ask me.  

Regards

I have played this game a lot of times and i believe that it contain a lot of mysteries.
I also want to open these fucking files so i can see all the unused and beta things in this game like the beta Rome.

But sadly there is no one who knows how to open them.

view link in my sig.
Try it, read it, understand it.

(Guess there will be no further support of Asterix&Obelix by me due to lack of time.)

The format is not too hard but you'll need to invest some time to figure out the structures.

The textures are harder to identify (LVL01):

Hello,
thanks for your interests.
But to SIMPLY get models, you can use the "Ninjaripper".
BUT you only get the Textures and models in T-Pose.

What's already missing is:
-vertex color of the models (the they dont use shadowmapping or something)
-bones/animations

Good luck! 

P.S.: Here is an examples for the vertex-color.
To see it in the game, use in Ninjaripper "Disable Textures".

Me, i want to see them outside the game.

Hello everybody,
I know it might not be a good idea to come in a topic that ceased to talk 3 years ago, but as a speedrunner and somebody really interested into this game's internal files and Beta I'd like to know if any of you who worked in extracting files would like to help us in our Asterix & Obelix XXL Discord page, probably the most active place on the world about that game.

About Beta Rome, we just found that behind regular Rome, by cheating through the gates you can access an almost emply area containing many objects including some never used in the rest of the level.
According to a former ELB dev, Rome was planned to be quite big but got cut down by time restrictions. So this video is probably all that is left...
