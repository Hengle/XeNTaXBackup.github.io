- Post Title: [Unity3D] One piece fighting path - Encrypted Asset

Hello, I would like some help to be able to open an encrypted .asset so far it was enough to remove one of the two headers but now it does not work with the new version of the game, apparently it would be XOR but I I'm still a beginner and this information is of no use to me.

I hope someone will answer me!
