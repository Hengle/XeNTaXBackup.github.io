- Post Title: DiRT Rally main game achieve game.bin

Hi,
I'm new to these forums.
I was wondering if anyone could provide any clues into the game.bin archive for Codemasters DiRT Rally.
Couldn't find any usual indicators such as strings, header etc.  

What I already know
- This file is a game archive which contains many directories and files. These are referenced in the game executable.
- Encrypted or compressed. I know that this archive contains both the database and language files which contains 1000s of strings. No readable strings present.
- Found the CreateFile() call that gets a handle to the file using IDA. However lack the experience to find the routine which this handle is actually read from.

Download game.bin

Any help with this file would be greatly appreciated.

Any progress with this? I'd like to create my own pacenotes in Finnish, and it seems that none of the sound banks have the pacenotes?!
