- Post Title: Immortal Unchained [bitsquid]

Hey!
Does anyone have any ideas how to unpack/repack bundle files from Immortal Unchained? Would like to check if a translation is possible.
It seems to use the same Bitsquid engine, as Helldivers, Magicka 2, etc., however the same tools doesn't seem to work.

Tried these: [viewtopic.php?f=10&t=12002&hilit=bitsquid#p106336](https://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=12002&hilit=bitsquid#p106336)



Example: [https://www103.zippyshare.com/v/nzvL1OhW/file.html](https://www103.zippyshare.com/v/nzvL1OhW/file.html)

Any help is appreciated!

Weird. All I get is a 403 Forbidden.
