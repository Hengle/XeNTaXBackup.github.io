Do you mean the MONSTER.SOU file? I cannot find a MONSTER.SOG in my installation.
Providing sample files are good, not everyone have all games installed, so it will help you getting a faster response and more accurate.

This file(65.2MB) is for Indiana Jones 4 the Fate of Atlantis games.
(Two links as above are the same.)



With any application, nothing was ripped from this file.
Many sound files might be in it, i guess.

Can anyone do this? Tell me.



-----------------------------
MONSTER.SOG file for Day of the Tentacle(Maniac Mansion 2) is more big than Indy4's. 256MB.

First of all, I'm sorry to respond you on this file extraction cause of not knowing uploading large file at that time.

MONSTER.SOG in Indiana Jones 4 the Fate of Atlantis is not a original version file. I guess. This file is created and converted from MONSTER.SOU with encoding ogg codec. I've been googling about this for almost 5 hours.

MONSTER.SOU file is a Original file.

I'm afraid that scummrev-2012 can not view the .SOG but view and play .SOU.

So I am going to find Monster.sou file from INDY 4 Atlantis.
Can you send me the MONSTER.SOU file?

It's possible to download scummrev-2012 from below URL.

Monster.sog is the compressed version created using the ScummVM tools.

If you have MONSTER.SOG, you also have the original CD with MONSTER.SOU. If you don't have the original CD, you downloaded an illegal version which only had the SOG.
