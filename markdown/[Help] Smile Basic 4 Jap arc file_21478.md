- Post Title: [Help] Smile Basic 4 Jap arc file

Hello,i am trying to mod Smile Basic 4 for Switch (jap version is the only available yet) changing the vibration files it included for the one i want.
All 62 bnvib files  are included on an file with arc extension.I have tried several tool but i have been unable to extract them.
Curiously the other files of the game also have the same extension and i could extract them without any problem with sactool.
I have look it with a hexeditor and it seems this file is a SBA2 format.
Could someone help me to unpack and pack bnvib files to this file? A lot of thanks and excuse me
