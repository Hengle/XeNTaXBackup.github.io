- Post Title: Unreal Engine 3 Character Textures

I've been trying...and having no luck in extracting the Character Textures from
the following Unreal Engine 3 games.

Wheelman
John Woo's Stranglehold
Brothers in Arms: Hell's Highway
Section 8

If someone could please take a shot at one or all of the above.
I'd be forever grateful.
All I need are the character textures only.

Thank you,

Ronin

the best choice for unreal engine should be gildor's umodel, check it at: [http://www.gildor.org/news](http://www.gildor.org/news)
Section 8's textures are in the compatibility list
also check in the forum, i don't know if that compatibility list is outdated.

Ya, I've been using Gildor's Umodel and was able to get it to work for UT3
and a couple of others titles but my luck ran out.

So whatever I was doing "right" stopped and I couldn't extract anything after that.

I was hoping someone out there might have better luck.

Thank you interloko,

Ronin

Were you running batch files to convert everything in a directory?  I noticed the tool doesn't like to convert when a directory starts to get pretty large in size, so I would move already converted folders it created out of that directory and continue with my batch and it would run fine .  I'd suggest getting a nice little utility called Listmaker to help with the batch conversion and that obviously, make sure you're not doing it right from the game directory!
