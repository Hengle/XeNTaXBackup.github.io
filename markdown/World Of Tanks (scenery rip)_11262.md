- Post Title: World Of Tanks (scenery rip?)

Hello,
Have anyone happen to rip the scenery of this game yet?
Ex:


This is an Online game name World Of Tanks. I really love those scenery, but after I unpack them, they are just parts of models and I don't know how to rebuild the scene. I don't know what gather them to a scenery, so please can you help me?

This is a .pkg of a scenery (map), all I can do now is using tools to look at .primitives models.
[https://www.dropbox.com/s/8obrwjmn9wj8a ... eville.pkg](https://www.dropbox.com/s/8obrwjmn9wj8axg/07_lakeville.pkg)

Thank you very much.

P/s: those .pkg just be extracted with 7-zip is ok
