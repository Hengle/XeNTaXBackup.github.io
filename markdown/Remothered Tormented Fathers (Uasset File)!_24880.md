- Post Title: Remothered Tormented Fathers (Uasset File)!

Hello
Is there a solution for extracting texts in uasset format?

I want to extract the text of the game I want from these files and I searched a lot to see how to extract and edit these files, but I did not find anything. Does anyone have a suggested solution or software or script that can solve my problem?
