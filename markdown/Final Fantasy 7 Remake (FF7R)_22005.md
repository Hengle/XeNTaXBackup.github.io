Good day, I recently bought FF7R. Does anyone know how to grab a .pkg file that you bought from PS store? It is stored on my PS4 and would like to move it to my PC. The process to make this happen would require a jailbroken PS4, and I cannot afford to brick my system in the event of a fuck up. So, does anyone know of an alternative method, or am I shit out of luck and need to bite the bullet?

Ps4 pkg's are useless without a firmware exploit on that version.
Only the demo can be decrypted currently.

Yep looks like it. The latest exploit for PS4 is 5.05, and its beyond outdated. I guess it's time to learn how to exploit PS4s lol

Yeah, he posted here:

Really weird, why keep the key private but release ripping tool? Is he expecting someone to pay for the decryption key or something?
