This game seems to use the same or very similar model format as the PS2 version. Do you think I could seen you a modified file that you can insert back to the game, and then you can take a screenshot of it so I can figure out how the tristrips work?

Here is the model, but it has some tristrips showing and no normal mapping, or uv mapping:

Many, many PS2 games (Devil May Cry 3 Pc is almost a direct port from the PS2) are Tristrips formed from joining 3 consective vertexes, in the order they are in. For Devil May Cry you do not connect 2 sections, as each section is one strip. Heck in Big Game Hunter PS2, theres some 4000 vertex animal meshes that are only one strip, but usally there are many strips for each mesh.

Is it possible to extract the model from this game? It would be great - but I see that it is really difficult - if all that time no one was able to do so. The game is not new, even old - and still very popular - but the extractor did not exist. Although many people would want that. Too bad!

Hi everyone.
I know this topic is pretty old, but I wanna try anyway.
I'd like to extract models from this game and I successfully extracted the files included in the .pac files (finally). The only problem is that I don't know where the model mesh is stored. Noesis can open textures only, other files with different formats, even .mods, can't be opened.
If someone could guide me it would be really great...

Sorry for double posting, not that I want to obsess you with this, it's just I noticed someone of you menaged to load the 3D model in 3DS Max and I'm dying to know how you did it... I don't know how to open the files from the ones I unpacked from the .pac file..
