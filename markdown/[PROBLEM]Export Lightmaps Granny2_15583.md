- Post Title: [PROBLEM]Export Lightmaps Granny2

Hello guys,

first i have to tell you that i am modifying a game which supports the granny2 engine for static models and have a little problem over here with exporting lightmaps from 3ds max for my own models and i wanted to ask if someone maybe could help me.
well, i have tried it several times with different export options and a lot of other stuff, i even tried it with v-ray but it never worked. in gr2-viewer my own models have the same options than the offical models, but i cant see them ingame.
basically the offical models were exported with 3ds max, so i think they also used the 3ds max lightmap method for their models.. so after a long time, i finally decided to ask you guys, if someone maybe would be that kind and could take a look at the attached files. i would really appreciate it, also you would help me very much and of course i would pay you, if you can help me get rid of this and show me the way how they did it with the offical models .



thanks for reading and please excuse my bad english 

best regards,

tharos

Hey guys,

also if its needed, i could give you the acutal source code of the granny sdk.
thanks for supporting this thread and please also notice, i am paying 350$ reward to the person who can help me with this problem.

also, as i have mentioned in the first post, i've tried it a lot by myself and attached some models that are exported by me.
the lightmap looks pretty similar to the offical one, so i think i am pretty close into it, just some settings are wrong/missing. (exported with normal 3ds max lightmap method).

e: to big for attachment to here's the link of the models exported by me :
