This is a Topic of Monsters vs Aliens Models Extracting Site.
It begins when the Topic needs Updating with People.
Based on the Open Season Version this needs a Post of PAK Files with QuickBMS
to use when models and other things get extracted and noesis.

OK, so the PAK File can be Unzipped in Zenhax for the bases of the Characters.

I'm Using B.O.B. for one of the Characters but what can i use in Noesis for the Model.
There's DAT or MDL.
