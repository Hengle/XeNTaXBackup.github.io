- Post Title: Cinema 4D model converter

Probably I'm not the only one here but I'm aiming to be able to use any 3d model format, and in the case of Cinema 4D (*.c4d) I think it's not worth to get even a pirated copy as a 4GB file converter... Is there any software or service that is either standalone, plugin to Noesis or some other multi model converter that can atleast export to *.obj file?
