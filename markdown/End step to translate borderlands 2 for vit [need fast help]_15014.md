- Post Title: End step to translate borderlands 2 for vit [need fast help]

To all hi, we are engaged in porting of borderlands 2 Russian versions from ps3 on PS Vita. We did a great job, but we stopped on one problem huge for us. We made exctractor bin, made automatic transfer of the transfers to bin (all information text is in bin the file, at start of a game, he creates folders and transfers everything according to files there). 
  But to us I remained to make a font as the font with ps3, compression probably not that isn't suitable for ps vita. We are compelled to ask for the knowing people of the help, to make the text of Cyrillics, the tga file with ps3 of the version is (in it there is the Russian font).

Vita use - NGP fonts , PS 3 - ps3.font.
