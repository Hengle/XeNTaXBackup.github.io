- Post Title: .SCB Model Files

I've done a search on how to import .scb files from The WarZ into Maya via .OBJ but I just found one post that didn't seem to have an answer. I've tried several solutions, spending several hours. I've tried scb2obj (google) which is a command line converter but doesn't work because it is older. I've tried a Maya plugin and that doesn't work. Does anyone know how I can convert the several hundred .scb files to obj?

Thanks!
