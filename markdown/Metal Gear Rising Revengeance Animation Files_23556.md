- Post Title: Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance Animation Files

Hi, I don't know if I'm in the right forum to ask this. It turns out that I want to extract the animations from Metal Gear Rising because I want to use them to make a video, but I don't know how to do it, and what programs should I use. If someone would help me I will be more than grateful

Hello, Thank you very much for answering my post. I ran the program and the plugin and put some animations to extract. Now I have a doubt, with this same program, can I extract the sounds from the game? It happens that I want to extract the sounds of Raiden's sword
