- Post Title: Playing .SND Files

Does anyone have a clue how I can play .SND audio files? I got them from a game called the Legend of Cao Cao, though they can't seem to work on any of the music players I currently have. Here's a sample: [link](http://www.mediafire.com/file/erf5op2x1c24uca/Game%20Sound%20Files.zip)

These files are not playable. 
How much sound do you think you can get from a file which is 148 bytes? 
Obviously there is something missing.

The .snds are just header files actual sound dataare in a .cab archive.
