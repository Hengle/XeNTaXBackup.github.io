- Post Title: MX Simulator - help with .jm file

Hello. Looking for any help or info on this. Game is MX Simulator. File format is .jm. I believe it is/contains a 3d model. It is an export via python script from Blender. I have the script if needed. I haven't been able to find any info on the file type nor any tools specifically for it. I tried using Model Researcher, but the tutorial examples were far from what I could see in hex edit mode. So I got nowhere.

Thank you in advance.
