- Post Title: [Switch] Help Unpacking Grisaia Switch Trilogy SCRIPT.PAK

I'm trying to save all that I can from the switch trilogy of grisaia as the data hoarder I am, and GARBro (the only program I know which can unpack files) could get the images and audio/videos unpacked just fine, but only the english text is readable from trying to unpack script.pak if I were to open the outputted no-extension files in a text editor. That's not good enough for me. There's no advertised engine on the promotional material nor the credits so I have to assume it's a sort of custom engine. I've never really gone in-depth on unpacking files before so I don't know where else I'd begin to start checking (other than the failed attempts of using a generic unpacker, probably for unity or other pc engines).


The following is a link to the script.pak file if anyone wants to take a look, but I'll also take direction (which I'll get to when I have free time): [https://www.mediafire.com/file/hrr3nl9q ... T.PAK/file](https://www.mediafire.com/file/hrr3nl9q4nol92r/SCRIPT.PAK/file)
