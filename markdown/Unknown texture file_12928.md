- Post Title: Unknown texture file

Hi!
I was starting to learn how to extract textures from a game by watching the tutorial videos on YouTube (by Mr.Mouse).
And today, I have a graphic file (I extracted this file from the game file by using a tool) which were compressed by zlib. After decompressing it, I still don't know how can I view the textures inside that file.

Can anyone help me with this file format please?
I attached the file in the attachment (both compressed and decompressed).

I will very thankful to any help!
Thank you so much!

Edited: I removed the file. It worked with some files. About other files, I'm trying to analyze them.

Thank you for replying! I didn't know that there's a wonderful tool like that!
I tried to learn how it works by reading the tutorials in trlc.planetaclix.pt (that's why I didn't reply immediately after reading your reply to this thread), but the palette somehow did not work properly with the .ptx file.

Edited: I was successful on some files. Other files were swizzled. I'm trying to analyze them.
