I checked some Sony's exclusives (such as Warhawk and Twisted Metal) and find out that all textures uses format .RTT. After easy reserches I found this: "Convert from DDS to RTT with DDS2RTT.exe". So default files was dds formats. Any tips to open it? Didn't find anything about this.

You can convert those .rtt files with quickbms and special script form for that:
[https://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?t=11234](https://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?t=11234)

But this script only extract standart X*X frames (length = width) and can't X*Y (length =/= width). For extraction X*Y files you should use Hex editor or write your own script.
