I'm trying to identify which game a texture I have comes from, but I'm not having any luck.  The only clue I have is the name of the texture itself, HanakoDiffuse.

The texture: [https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Ud9z4 ... fO21VHzNc5](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Ud9z4ED85qr-JWqnUzoi2mfO21VHzNc5)

It is a mod for GTA San Andreas : [https://gamemodding.com/en/gta-san-andr ... anako.html](https://gamemodding.com/en/gta-san-andreas/skins/45013-hanako.html)

Awesome!  Thanks akderebur, this was driving me nuts!!  Talk about an obscure game!  Nothing I searched for turned up anything about this character or the game Fireburst (the game Hanako is from).

Since my last request was such a resounding success, I'm going to ask for help once again.  Same problem, the filename is the only clue, suke.

Well, I've managed to track down a Skyrim mod (tes4mod) that uses part of the suke texture, but haven't figured out which game it comes from.

After digging further into the skyrim mods, I found a shop mod that includes the full model, so at this point I'm gonna call it done.  The mod is called "Sweet and Sexy Lingerie Shop CBBE" for those interested.

OK, new challenge, maybe a little easier, maybe not.  I've got a Dead Or Alive texture named "tina_taits_base".  From the naming conventions of DOA models, I know it's from the Tina Armstrong character,  but I don't know which game or costume.  I'm not even entirely sure it's from any of the games, but I also haven't found any mods (other than the model this texture came with) that use it either.

And a new challenge:  I've got a bikini that's part of a mod, and I have no idea what game it's from.  Anyone recognize it?
