- Post Title: SVR 2010 SaveData.dat

Not sure if this is the right forum to ask this question, but would anyone be able to tell me if the SaveData.dat file in SmackDown vs Raw 2010 is a compressed file?  If so, is there a tool out there that can be used to uncompress it?  Any help would be appreciated.  Thanks

Yeah, I've had my eyes on that thread quite a bit, but it doesn't really say much about how to get the contents out of the file.
