- Post Title: KOF: Maximum Impact Regulation 'A' (Arcade) .pak files

Hello,

I was looking at the files for the Arcade version of this game (which uses Renderware of course) and i noticed that it's a little bit unencrypted. I looked through the headers of some of the paks -

PLYM - .dff models
PLYT - txd textures
PLYI - most likely hair and item meshes
PLYA - anm animation
PLYS - for demos or something

Any way to extract these paks?
