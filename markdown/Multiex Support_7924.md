Hey guys,

I know that you have a program called Multiex which opens compressed game files.
I have a game called Mx vs Atv Reflex which i would like for you guys to add to your
game files list. If this is possible then that would be awesome and I thank you
but if not a quick note to tell me so would be appreciated. 

The core files are .dx9.package. Along with .dx9.database. Similar to Sims3
