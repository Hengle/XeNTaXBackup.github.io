- Post Title: Age of Gunslingers

Looking for help with Age of Gunslingers localization files.
Game based on UE3 and files seems to be XORed, that's all I know   

Localization samples are attached, full game client can be found at [http://tps.qq.com/web201406/download.shtml](http://tps.qq.com/web201406/download.shtml)
