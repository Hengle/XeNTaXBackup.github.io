- Post Title: Jumper: Griffin's Story (X360) - XWB / XSB files

Hello, I'm trying to extract voices files from Jumper: Griffin's Story
I first tried with the PS2 version of the game but couldn't extract the "DATA.PAK" so I tried with the Xbox version and succeeded.
Sound files are in XWB (with XSB) file format, using PsychonautsExplorer1.3 I easily extracted the XWB file into wav and some files are correctly named except that they are all unreadable.
If anyone could help me extract correctly or make the files readable, that would be awesome.

Here is a zip file with the XWB/XSB with the extracted wav:
