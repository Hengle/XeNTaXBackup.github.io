- Post Title: Wildstar .area File

Greetings fellowers,
Firstly iam extremely enthusiastic about these versatile reading tools. Iam a modder of the WoW 3.3.5 Client and creating new assets, tools to improve mapping Skills and World Creation. The only blockade that stands in my way are the (Scripting) Based things which i will never understand so iam always committed and the happiest guy by using Community created tools which makes everything possible for what iam doing now. Exploring Art and Assets is the most fun and analyzing different Art perspectives. I dont know if this is the Right forum corner since the Model is a Terrain.
The good old Game Wildstar(RIP) has some awesome Design when it comes to Terrain i succesfully imported the "Heightmaps" into Blender through an Tool Called (WildstarStudio). But there is one thing left the (Splatmaps) which places the Tileset Textures on an Alpha Texture. For myself i tried to read the different Reading scripts but i totally loosed overview of such things since ive never wrote a script by my own. There are two file types left which i never figured out how to get information out of them .i3(Big Structures: House, Buildings) and the .area(Terrain) Files. But since .i3 are extremely easy to replicate through ingame Tools they shouldnt be a problem. The bigger problem is the .area File the last piece are those Alpha Textures to replicate a full Terrain with Textures.

This is a part of an Project which i call "Portcraft" where i port for fun other games in to WoW 3.3.5
