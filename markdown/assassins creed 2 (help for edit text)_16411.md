And you came here to lie again.
We(Brazilians) translated the game a long time ago, and like I told you, I'm don't have the 010 Editor scripts anymore and like I told you(again), Kramla, who make those scripts, abandoned the gamehack scene for good(as you can see in his Xentax profile).
You make yourself a fool, making lies about people who you don't know.
Be more humble and less arrogant. For that reason, Kramla provided the scripts only for us, becouse we don't make translations for acknowledgment or fame, we make translations becouse we love do that, and we were happy in provide the opportunity for those who don't understand english, play your favorite games in your native language, whether they are brazilians or not.

This guy said in another post that it was impossible to recreate the forge files and a lot of more bullshits, so I said it was possible because we had translated AC2 game, so he sent me a PM asking me about how to do this becouse he wanted to translate the AC2 game too.
My response was something like this::

He assumed that I was lying and that I did not provided the scripts to him only for selfishness. He's talking about me when he talks about selfish people and who tried to make him a fool.

I don't know if he is a liar or not, but I just want to say that GHOST DEAD seems to be pretty retarded and all his posts where he writes weird messages (including this topic) should by deleted by moderators.
