- Post Title: Ultimate Marvel Vs Capcom 3

So, people found a way to rip models/textures from the game. Since no one bothered to rip the voice files from the vanilla version, let's try with ultimate.

I've extracted the voice files from the .arc archives with quickbms, and it extracted many files but most of them were only 1 kb, the largest one had an extension of .spc

Any way to convert these into wav? I am using the x360 version of the game if that matters.
