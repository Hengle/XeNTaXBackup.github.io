I'm trying to reverse engineer Nitemare 3D, I spent a bit of time examining the SOUND.DAT file and found Creative Sound File and MIDI headers, the problem is I have no idea how to actually read the files from the archive using C++, can anyone help me with this? I also found a program to extract the files but it has no available source code and only works on Windows.
