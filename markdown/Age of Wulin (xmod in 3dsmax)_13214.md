well I have maxscript but the files won't load, give error and really is a pain in the ass, for example for weapons you don't need load bones, but script for defaul ask to load bones first, if you cancel, you can't load weapons, I remember it before, but well here I leave and maybe Taylor can fix this issue to load models,etc, many thanks for support Taylor.
