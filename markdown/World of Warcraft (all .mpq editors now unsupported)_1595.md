The MPQ files from Blizzard are not simple files - they have a bunch of encryptions and things like that to help prevent users from opening the archives and screwing around with the game files (ie cheating/hacking) . I think Rahly or someone was *maybe* working on a plugin for this - otherwise your best bet would be to try a standalone *.mpq archive tool like those for Warcraft 3 and Diablo 2.

Yeah custom encryption, compression, stripped filenames -> hash table etc. 
Need to find some information about the format.

There are libs and code in a large number of languages to open mpq files, check curse-gaming.com, they have a number of mpq editors that will open the newest mpq files
