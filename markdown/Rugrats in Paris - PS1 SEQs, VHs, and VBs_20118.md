- Post Title: Rugrats in Paris - PS1 SEQs, VHs, and VBs

I am trying to rip Rugrats in Paris for PlayStation. To get the files, I ripped them using VGMToolbox To put them together, I am trying to use GenPSF, but I am having trouble correlating the SEQ, VH, and VB files properly (the files in question are [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Dpiv-p3YwhPoDkJF5mS4Rikyrngt9ZiA)). Is there a method to finding the VH+VBs that need to go with the corresponding SEQ files?

VB + VH can be opened in foobar2000 with the vgmstream component. Upload the SEQs.

Thank you for the reply. The SEQs are included with the .zip file downloadable in my first post. Is it worth mentioning that I am trying to create playable PSF files?
