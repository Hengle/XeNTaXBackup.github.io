- Post Title: Live2D Extract Request from a mobile game

Hello,
I would really appreciate if someone could extract the Live2D models from Revue Starlight Re:Live. I tried to do it myself but sadly, I failed.
Link to the game: [https://play.google.com/store/apps/deta ... e.ww&hl=en](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=jp.co.atm.smile.ww&hl=en)

Thank you very much in advance.
