We haven't even figured out the codec yet. It's the same in MGS3. Also, why MP3?

Nor is MGS4 or MGS3. Never said they were encrypted. Only said the none of us can figure out the codec yet which prevents us from writing a decoder. MGO uses the same codec if it has those dbm files which are MTA files embedded inside.
