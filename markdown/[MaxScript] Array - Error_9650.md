- Post Title: [MaxScript] Array - Error

So i try to get the vertices from a file and writing them in an array, the script reads the file and everything works,
but it stops at the array and throws me this error:
"faces argument must be an array, got: undefined"
do i have any syntax errors?

I would say you got yourself an undefined variable.  Without seeing the code I cannot be more specific than that.
