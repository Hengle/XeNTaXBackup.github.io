- Post Title: Dynasty Warriors File Extraction and Model/Animation rip

I can see people extracting dw9 game models through xnalara model, but I don't know how to extract the file that has the .bin format.
And also, are there ways to extract animation files?

Yes animations are extracted as well, every asset the game has gets extracted, but no, animations are NOT reversed to usable format (that I know of) the way models/textures are, probably never will be.
