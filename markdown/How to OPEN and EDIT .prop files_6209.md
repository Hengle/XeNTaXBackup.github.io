- Post Title: How to OPEN and EDIT .prop files?

Hello, I'm trying to translate Tales Of Monkey Island into Arabic, everything went so good except for the fact that the subtitles of the game appear letter by letter from left to right, so after I translate it to Arabic, I want letters to appear from right to left (or at least they all appear at the same time, so that the player can read em easily)

I've found this file in "ui_subtitle_popup.prop" and I believe that's the one file that would help me do that, but I have no idea how to edit or run .prop files, so anybody got an idea?

The file is in the attachment
[ui_subtitle_popup.rar](https://xentaxbackup.github.io/file/4049_ui_subtitle_popup.rar)
