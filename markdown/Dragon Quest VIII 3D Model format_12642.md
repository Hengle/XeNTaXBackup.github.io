- Post Title: Dragon Quest VIII 3D Model format

Hey Guys.

Using the following tool I managed to extract all the files from Dragon quest VIII: [http://www.pokanchan.jp/dokuwiki/softwa ... ole#dq8ext](http://www.pokanchan.jp/dokuwiki/software/console#dq8ext)

Note, its in Japanese, but it should be easy for anyone who can't read Japanese to use the command line exe with no issues at all.

After extracting I can see all the directories, everythings laid out in a fairly clear way of whats what, inside many of the folders are .chr, .mpk and .img files, according to a bit of hex viewing these contain .mds files, and the .mds files are the 3d models.

I'm unable to find anything that will extract from these formats, none of them really appear to have much of a header, more so a list of contents.

I've uploaded an extracted folder here: [https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/7797280/Dq8_wm.zip](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/7797280/Dq8_wm.zip) for anyone interested to take a look.

Despite this games popularity its never actually been possible to view anything more than a few TIM2 files (publicly at least), hopefully this will change that, DQ8 was probably one of the PS2's best games.

wm.mpk looks like terrain mesh, maybe 123 small submeshes:
