- Post Title: CVM Confusion

Im sure people ask this quite often, but I am trying to extract the MODELS folder out of the DATA.CVM for persona 4. I have installed Apache3 and have been able to open the file, but when I extract, nothing appears in the output folder. I thought maybe it was an error i created using a hex editor to get rid of some of the encrypton. Anyway I try to re extract a fresh CVM from the game disc itself and it only extracts DATA.CVM not the data inside. How do I fix this?

I explain as comprehensible as possible in some images
. 
You have hex editor,right? (i wrote "binary editor".)
Open "image.cvm" with your hex editor.
Then, you see it like this.
(some old hex editors can not open as too much big file.)


And now,
Plz select hexs from hex#0000000 to hex#00001800.


Cut it!


Now, save as an other name, "image.iso".
I suggest that you do not overwrite as same file name.


If u can not understand my word, Please PM to me,
