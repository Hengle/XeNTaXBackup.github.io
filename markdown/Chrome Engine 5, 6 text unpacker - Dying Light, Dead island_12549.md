Hey, I tried using it on Win 8.1, I drag and drop the .bin file on your exe, wait for a minute and it throws an error.
I can take a screenshot of it, when I get home.

The repacker doesn't work correctly.

The repacked .bin is smaller than the original and the game can't read the repacked .bin files, so the in-game text is blank.

The unpacked .xlsx also contains some garbled strings.

Can you release the source code for your unpacker/repacker?

Oh, and for some reason, you're including, but not using, ICSharpCode.SharpZipLib.dll.
