Same shit different day; you know the drill.
Sorry, too lazy to upload pic or instructions; I've been sick for a month and antibiotics made me worse and now I gotta go see doc again.

Bones + weights; sorry, no morphs, as I can't figure out the morph format.
If you want to help me decode the morph format, [more information is located here](http://www.saintsrowmods.com/forum/threads/morph-target-clues.5131/), where I asked the developers if they could give me hints on the morph format but no luck. Positions are stored as shorts and every fixed-point format I could think of didn't work.

File "npc_basehead.ccmesh_pc"  is  for base head mesh.

Cmorph_pc file  has  new vertex position of base head mesh by adding  dx,dy,dz for each vertex from base head mesh,
where:
dx = uint16 * 2^scale 
dy = uint16 * 2^scale
dz = uint16 * 2^scale

scale = -20,-21,sometimes -22

so dx,dy,dz are very small.

Here is example for playing with scale for saints_female_shaundifuture head.

How use:
-install Blender 249 and Python 26
-unpack importer
-click Blender249.blend

-in Text Window press alt+p and select:
cmesh_pc for skinned mesh with skeleton
cmorph_pc for shape morph

 If something wrong, please send me console error or file.

After importing it must manual set scale,position and rotation for head mesh.

You need to have the Python Imaging Library installed for this script to work   

You can download it here: [http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/](http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/) (there is a version for Python 2.6)

I tried the importer, and it works great, but for some reason it imports female morphed heads even for male characters.

Importer use only one base mesh - npc_basehead.ccmesh_pc file
Maybe there is another base head?
Please import as first npc_basehead.ccmesh_pc from importer folder, and then cmorph file .
 if no difference between two meshes it fault my script, else try to change value SCALE=21 at the beginning of the script.
What model did you import?

 here are some heads from game

Changing the size to 20 worked on the model I tried to import. XD

I guess you have to change sizes on SOME models, because other sizes give a wrong head shape.

Thanks once again

Hi Guys, I'm bumping this topic just in the hope of finding an answer to my questions about the morph files for saints row III. I know they have a similar setup as SRIV because I have managed to get it working. What I don't get though is where these scale values for X Y and Z are located. I cannot find them anywhere in the character files. Not the CCMESH, GCMESH, morph file or even the rig file. They just seem to be hidden somewhere out of sight. Does anyone know where I could possible find them?

I've been working on an import script for 3ds max, and I've come a long way. But these morph values are giving me a headache! 
For my work, check out this topic:

I'm having some trouble with a specific mesh. It's bizarre, most other meshes I have work with this blender script, but this one causes a 'memory error' when I try to import it. It's the only one I've seen that does it so far. [https://www.dropbox.com/s/iuso58umanejl ... s.zip?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/iuso58umanejlcx/cm_demon_wings.zip?dl=0)

Is there some way to get in Blender the "surface" geometry, not only matcap?
