*sigh*


Why don't ya think the ONLY way for make bones for that game?

because know how many the flyff game was out, and still, they ever make a plugin/scrip for 3D max our Cinema 4D...

it's normally that they don't care.
because the only way that the edit they gonna take effect are in the private servers, and many times for make them as CS Sets/Weapons, make the stupid use real money for buy it. [and we know that make money with mods our something like that it's not allowed.]



now returning to the topic.
they are just one way for make mods our ever import/extract.
and that his with the old tool "o3dconvertor" that thing, that look so simple, it's the master machine for that game.

for give ya a example, i'm the first guy in the world that make a mod of a complete model of other game for this game:
[http://i1091.photobucket.com/albums/i40 ... 7-62-1.png](http://i1091.photobucket.com/albums/i400/umbrodark1/Neuz2012-01-0621-19-27-62-1.png)


The other problem with the Flyff game it's that all the data it's not out.
for example:
all the sets of lv 1 to 60 are not in the folders.
and the only way for get them as data it's combining the "CS View" + "3DRipper Tool" 
but, don't expect to put it again in game, because they are not the date for replace.



PD: i'm a noob in animation, so in that  i don't touch it XD

The only problem with this thing, it's ya cannot put back in .o3d format if ya want to make it as "clothe"

they are not plugin to for "make the bones in a 3D manipulator"



the last, our almost, "best" i can do for ripped a new model for that game using the "o3dcovertor tool" , with bones and all:












in term of animations, i don't ever touch.
because i suck editing that things LOL.

Can you give me the link of program that you used to import animation into 3D Studio ? I tried to download o3dconverter of pipeline in ragezone but it only has "export obj" option ?

Can you give me the link of program that you used to import animation into 3D Studio ? I tried to download o3dconverter of pipeline in ragezone but it only has "export obj" option ?the animations imported with script can import mesh too just follow this steps.

1. Locate the texture file. DO THIS FIRST! Otherwise you will get an error and have to restart the script.

2. Find the o3d model of choice.

3. Locate the bone file (if any).

4. Click the Skinned Model button and now your model is skinned, weighted and ready for animation either by loading the ani file or how ever you want.

It work. Thank you very much !

I have some problems. When i chose "Skinned Model", the weight is wrong and when i loaded "animation", the animation is very weird. I using 3DS MAX 2010.
I downloaded Fly For Fun client from "Gpotato".
Do you have any problems like me ? Which version of 3DS Max you are using ?

seriously, stop saying " use the o3d converter to bla bla bla"

The reason I would like this import and export script for 3ds max to work is because you can only do limited animations with the o3d coverter, in other words, only do animation on the stuff that already exist..

for instance. You are absolutely not able to create new wings.
create new motions for character
create new monsters
create whatever you feel like creating...

and If this script gets fixed, you are able to do pretty much anything..


Someone asked what format to export with..
usualy it is .ASE which you open with COLA and in cola you open the .ase and it will automaticly convert it to o3d, or ani /with .chr.. if the bones are added correctly..

when you add the animation and skinn everything, the animation is pretty much wrong..

as I did say on the first post..

CriticalError. About your messed up texture, I am not sure why you did get that, it seems to work for me without any kind of error..

I really hope someone made a progress as I have tried to read and understand the scripts content.. without learning anything from it.. in other words it is way too much for me haha D=

I fix my problem, thanks a lot.

Made any progress that you could share?the animations imported with script can import mesh too just follow this steps.

1. Locate the texture file. DO THIS FIRST! Otherwise you will get an error and have to restart the script.

2. Find the o3d model of choice.

3. Locate the bone file (if any).

4. Click the Skinned Model button and now your model is skinned, weighted and ready for animation either by loading the ani file or how ever you want

I think one limitation on these forums, based on what I've seen over the past year, is that it's focused on resource extraction in general.

Rarely a specific game, and unless the resources were absolutely awesome (eg: great models), or maybe there was high demand for it (eg: some popular game's models), a particular game may get maybe 20% of a person's attention and only for a couple days at max.

People come here asking for great things like the complete spec for their favorite game that they want to add new content for, but walk away disappointed most of the time. They get the resources in a usable format and if they're lucky enough they get a re-packer, but other than that, that's pretty much it. Usually not useful at all for whatever their goal is.

I mean, sure, they might have experience running private servers, packet-editing, making bots, getting past security etc. which of course may help but not that much. Clearly more research needs to be done in the field of game modding in order to provide a more standard way of developing, testing, and distributing mods. You have people that know how to get models out, but don't know how to get them back in.

I don't even know how to test whether new content has been successfully added.
I imagine I would need to run a private server, which requires me to understand how to set one up in the first place. Unless there was a simple distribution that allows me to click a setup button and have it done for me, I'm probably not going to put effort into it just to verify that whatever I'm doing actually produces results.

Yess, well.. that is a given, but if you read the first post, the animation is not complete at all.. it is all wrong and read the wrong bones with the part it is skinned with..

If I understand this right, you are most likely able to get a fix to this without being able to even try this out..

well, leave a pm to me, I could try it out for you.. Would be highly appriciated if this could be fixed ^^
