- Post Title: Maui Mallard in Cold Shadow [PC version]

Hello guys, I'm a big fan of these game. It has two versions, one for Genesis and Windows, other for SNES.
I'm ripping the graphics from these games, (already ripped some sprites from SNES version) but I can't extract from the Windows version (wich has enhanced graphics, comparing with Genesis').

As I don't know anything about programing, I thought you guys could help me. Can't post the files, so I attached a "printscreen" of the game's folder, listing the files. If anyone has a tip about how o extract the graphics from this game I would be very thankful.

The game was made by Creative Capers Entertainment, published by Disney Interactive.
