- Post Title: DC Universe Online .fsb files

Hello, I was directed here by aluigi of aluigi.org.
I've been attempting to get some of the music from the recently releated DC Universe Online, which uses FSB files.
[Here's a link to the thread](http://aluigi.freeforums.org/dc-universe-online-fsb-files-t1708.html) at the aluigi.org forums with the relevant information.

Thanks.
