I think its a pe file with hardcoded strings.(?)
Try some pe explorers, or localization tool (lingobit,radialix).
Or you can try exestringz or OgreGUI.

I'm really curious to know what Microsoft Excel has to do with the binary editing of an executable or a raw files.
I didn't know it became a magic tool to do anything in the world...
