have you read the rules of the forum?
have you provided a sample file?
how much files are available in this game and what's their extension and size?

sorry about that. here are the file types with the sizes:

4xm files --> ~1-56mb
pak files --> ~35kb
pcx files --> ~2-4kb
tst files --> ~1-2kb
vr  files --> ~30-800kb

4xm are the videos: [http://wiki.multimedia.cx/index.php?title=4xm_Format](http://wiki.multimedia.cx/index.php?title=4xm_Format)
pak are too small to contain something useful
pcx are small images
tst probably text stuff?
vr probably 3d animation stuff?

in any case this is not something for the "Game Archive Research" forum because they are not archives, they are simple files.

The 4xm files from the GoG Version are up to 55MB and no regular 4xm files. any help with those?
