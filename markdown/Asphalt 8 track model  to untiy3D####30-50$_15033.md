Oh, thank you for your reply godskin, I went to the site to view the [http://gamemodels.ru/files](http://gamemodels.ru/files), are Asphalt 8 model cars, and no Asphalt 8 Track scene model, or other track racing game scene model, I did not find it?
I would like to find some racing track scene model. Do you have a website?

If you are interested in race track meshes, you could try ripping the Assetto corsa tracks.. Very easy to do ( i believe there are a couple of extractors on this site) they started as fbx and just get packed into a KN5 file..
And the best part, all of the official Assetto tracks are laser scanned... Including Nordschleife.. A full laser scanned version of the worlds most famous track.... All the cars are extractable as well..
