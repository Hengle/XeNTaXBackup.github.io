- Post Title: Help: Hex codec info for PSX files

Yeah I sound stupid,but I need your help:
Since nobody helps me to analyze my game(I am not angry about that,don worry) I want to analize the game by myself via Hex.

Buuuut I don't have any Code knowledge about the file formats layout of the PSX games(for 2D).
Also I want to know about the  Playstation image file formats only,but I don't know what of them are.

Could you give me a guide or a list about what kind of image formats exist and how those formats are construckted in hex or C++?

It would be a big help for me,because I can better work on a tool for ripping.
