- Post Title: Looking for a specific files to use the DDD2BBS Converter...

Does anyone here know what all the files are supposed to be in order to use the BBS2ddd converter? I'm missing one crucial file, and no one seems to know what or where it is, I was hoping someone here knew. I want to make a ddd mod for kh2fm, but I can't unless I can convert ddd animations to anb to add to my mod. If anyone here knows please help me, I really want to start on this mod.


BTW I tried attaching a screen shot but your image displaying feature is broken, cuz it was previewing as a broken image.

Also sorry if this isn't the place ask this, It says game specific tools so I figured it was but if not please move this to the correct place.

I'm in search of exactly such a tool in order to create custom pam files for DDD. Sadly, I couldn't find anything about it neither. If you had the link for the deleted reddit page you mentioned, then perhaps waybackmachine might be worth a try and if you can find out the tools author, then of course contacting him would be your primary option.
