- Post Title: Resident Evil 4 Remake- Sound Files

I extracted the files from the .pak with the RE-Tool，I extracted the .sbnk, found the audio, and tried converted the .wem files with wem-ogg-converter.
but it's doesn't work，It says "Parse error: expected 0x42 fmb if vorb missing" 。
My question is: how do I convert these other .wem files?

If you rename the .sbnk to .bnk and it'll play fine in Foobar/vgmstream.

Any luck with getting sounds from RE4R? Nothing works for me.
