- Post Title: Halo Infinite Kaitai Structs

Here are some probably broken and unfinished kaitai structs for both the .module and tag files from Halo Infinite

[https://gist.github.com/matty45/8fcba7c ... 73e23c6b44](https://gist.github.com/matty45/8fcba7c9be3fad741c9b8673e23c6b44)

I hope this helps someone!

This would not have been possible thanks to the information from [https://github.com/ElDewrito/AusarDocs](https://github.com/ElDewrito/AusarDocs) and MontagueM's Module extractor for the flight builds of halo infinite!

Do you have that extractor? I'm trying to rip the Wwise soundbanks from Infinite.
