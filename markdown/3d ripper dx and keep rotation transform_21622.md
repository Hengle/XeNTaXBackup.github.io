- Post Title: 3d ripper dx and keep rotation transform

Hey guys,
I'm in a project which consist of ripping maps from pc games.
I've been using ninja ripper & 3d ripper dx but both have major disadvantage for what i want to do
Ninja ripper works fine with static part of the map but some parts of my scene appears in the wrong place after converting to fbx (seems that mobile parts of the scene appears in the middle of the scene)
3d ripper dx works well for ripping all elements with correct relative position between elements, unfortunately and unlike NR, 3DRpipper DX doesn't conserve the original transforms of the whole scene after converting to fbx. So I have a scene which tilt following the 3 axis of my camera during the rip
Is there any tip to keep the scene oriented as the ingame rotation (or at least keep the horizontal part horiszontal)? In the current state, i would have to manually rotate scene following the 3 axis which is awfull job, rotate scene following only 2 axis would already be great

tks for your help
