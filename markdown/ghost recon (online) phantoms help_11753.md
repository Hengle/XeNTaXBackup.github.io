can someone help me with these models please?

the game runs under yeti engine the same that Ghost recon future soldier, the problem is all models looks weird (in ninja ripper and hex2obj) maybe the normal values for the mesh are in negative .

torso mesh.



maybe someone can create a 3ds max script or noesis script for import in correct form the models.

here some files

Same issue I've run into.  I can get a close resemblance to the shape, but there are always quite a number of verts that are all over the place.

I haven't had much time recently to get back into this, but I also haven't figured out what's causing the problem.

It would be great if someone else could maybe tell us what's going on.

I used the bms script from aluigi for extract the yeti.big file.
if I use ninja ripper or intel gpa the models looks in the same form

a guy called rarefacer has modify the max script for import ninjaripper *.rip files with normal values in negative but he lost the script

this format will require some fiddling, I guess. This is what I got from m_GRO-COM01-Helm03_PC_00000001:

The point cloud (button noPtC -> PtCld) is giving flat shapes only so the parameters I chose (or the cutting done by hex2obj) may be wrong.
("cutting" means getting the maximum vertex value and subtracting its half value from all vertices of an axis, iirc)

edit: well, this is a strange proceeding, admitted, but it worked fine on Ratchet&Clank models, iirc.
But it should be replaced by some decent short conversion (view my next post).

The vertex count (4625) and the face index count (12441) might be stored at
0x002B: 11 12 00 00 and 0x0033: 99 30 00 00

You should ask this guy what he did with "vertex" values! They are shorts, which from what I've seen should be divided /32767.0 and something more I guess.

EDIT: Can you provide few NinjaRipper files/rips?

Luxox18, have you tried to rip models Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon: Future Soldier? If yes, are they corrupted in the same way as from Ghost Recon Online?

Hi guys! I founded this forum and my experience with Ghost Recon: Future Soldier, was dissapointing in the extractions process. I'm not a script, codding or development expert, but triying and triying, i founded a way, not to extract entirely models, but yes to reconstruct them (only character models).

I had a little modified Ninja Ripper script (i lost it a year ago formatting my pc), result of that triying and triying with the extracted Ninja ripper files, but it just could return to a manipulable shape the "squizzed" meshes.



Then, i start a rebuilding process manually working purely with 3ds Max skills.









And so...  This is my final results





(Photo album link [https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set ... 260&type=3](https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.690904467629932.1073741829.223361234384260&type=3))


I just need a better resolution textures, Ninja Ripper can't extract high resolutions, just the two main characters (Jhon Kozak and Ram√≠rez from the initial mission) have highg resolution, and have a decent look. the other models have low resolutions like 512x512 and 1024x512 for full body and looks ugly in detail.

Luxox, i go to work in the online models published in the mf link, and please, continue extractions in Ninja Ripper formats, and xentax members, maybe, exist any way to extract the full resolution textures from yeti files? i tried with bms without results.

after having had a look at this again I'm not sure whether we have mesh data here.
For me it looks more like some kind of cubemapped uv data (just a wild guess):

Yeah, I got like this too when I use hex2obj or ninjaripper.

On another try I got this:

How to expand these flattened coordinates?
For me it seems to be impossible without additional data - but where to search for it?

In the VB block of 32 bytes or in another file? - Guess: no.

The only possibility I could think of is that they use some kind of compression.
But I don't have a clue how to decompress the 2D vertices (on each plane of the cube) into 3D ones.

So a maybe solution is burried in Rarefacer's lost script, whatever.

Perhaps someone gets an idea from viewing the wavefront obj data:

Some good news, I figured out Ghost Recon Phantoms and Future Soldier meshes   I'm going to post script soon, just will do some tests to bring weights right

No problem   Soon I'll release maxscript which will import NinjaRipper rips (.rip) with weights for YETI engine games (tested Ghost Recon Series and Lost: Via Domus)

If you release your script, you'll be my biggest reverse engineer hero!!!  
I tried literally hundreds of ways to RE grp, without any luck.

Okay guys, sorry for such huge delay! Here's script to import NinjaRipper .rips of YETI Engine game (Ghost Recon: Phantoms/Lost: Via Domus/ Beawulf). You will get game rig - just bones misplaced, but skin weights will be original. I will post script for original in-game files of Ghost Recon:Phantoms soon

P.S. Report bugs and problems

Hi guys

Little question here. How you run Ghost recon online from Ninja Ripper? I mean, every time I try to run the main .exe from ninja ripper, it says "please, run Ghost Recon from Ubi Launcher" and when I load from there, it says "run from steam" and... common       

So, what's the correct way to run this?

You should use wrapper not injector method (buy choosing wrapper and clicking "run" button NinjaRipper will copy d3d9.dll into folder with .exe, it's important to have this file in the same place as .exe of GR:Phantoms) then just run game from launcher

Also, you can get here my script to import models directly into 3d max without NinjaRipper, textures are headerless .dds files

Hi all again

I have another little question. I've extracted the hole yeti.big file from the Ghost Recon Phantoms, and it seems to have pretty cool thins inside. Nevermind, files are extracted as ".File" and the crappy way of renaming the file as ".obj" or something, doesn't work.

Has anyone an idea or suggestion of what can I do?

Thanks in advance

zaramot, so the solution to the square mesh problem was the vw part right?

```
	getPos = ftell f + 32
	vx = ((readshort f))	
	vy = ((readshort f))
	vz = ((readshort f))
	vw = ((readshort f))	
	tu = ((readshort f))
	tv = ((readshort f)*-1)	
	append vertArray ([(vx * vw), (-vy * vw), (vz * vw)] / 655350) --??	
	append UV_array ([tu, tv, 0] / 1024)	--??
)

```

also, what is the reason behind dividing by 655350 and 1024?

Hi there!

Is there any chance to get the links alive? The original ones are deleted by mediafire.

Thanks in advance
