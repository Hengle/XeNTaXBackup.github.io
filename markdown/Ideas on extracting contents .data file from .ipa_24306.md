- Post Title: Ideas on extracting contents .data file from .ipa

A very good day to the wonderful Xentax community and the incredible ideas it holds.

With pardon to my ignorance I am curious to know if anyone would be so kind as to share their ideas on how to extract the contents of a .data file from an .ipa package.

This is purely non commercial and not seeking to copy other peopleâ€™s work. 

I have experimented with UnityAssetExplorer and also DevX magic software however, I cannot seem to make sense of how to extract the contents of the .data file into a comprehensive format. To note I believe the .data file houses 3D model files. 

Again just exploring this for self learning.

With best wishes to you all.

A very good day to you all.

I hope that you are keeping well.

I was just checking in to see if anyone had some ideas on how to proceed with this enquiry?

Another possible Avenue is for me to provide the .ipa to someone with the right knowledge and pay an agreed fee to have the models extracted.

If you are interested please do feel free to let me know.

All the best!

Hi, what is the name of the game which this IPA file comes from?
And yes, please upload a sample and share a link with us.

Also, paying for such work is forbidden here.

Dear Ikskoks and indeed all,

Thank you for your reply.

My apologies for being unaware of the payment guidelines.

For those of you with inspired minds please find available the aforementioned .data files

Once again I am interested to know how the 3D models and corresponding surface/texture maps can be viewed.

Thank you for your ideas and enjoy your day!

I don't know anything about exporting 3D Models from Unity games,
but I've checked your samples and they are opening fine in the newest AssetStudio.

Anyway, I'm moving your topic to the 3D Models section. 
Maybe someone else from this subforum will be able to help you.

Thank you kindly ikskoks for your valued reply and thoughts.

Yes I did attempt using the latest edition of Asset Studio however, this does not seem to be able to extract the models, only raw large .data files.

Anyone with their own acumen and creativity to tackle this challenge would be most appreciated. 

I am keen to hear your ideas!

Thank you.

A very good day to you all.

A quick further query to those of you with inspired minds to try and move things along with these models and their extraction.

It would seem to my novice understanding that the .ipa and the majority of assets within, are merely a framework to display the models which I believe are compressed within the .data files.

If this is the case, does anyone have some ideas on how to decompress the .data files so as to access the models within?

May you all enjoy your day.
