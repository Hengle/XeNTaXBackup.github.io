- Post Title: The Simpsons Game PS3 - Extracting Models

Hey there! I'm trying to extract some models from The Simpsons Game, i know there is a way to extract the wii models, however PS3 has more content, and also higher quality models. The files i'm trying to extract are the .ps3 files and preinstanced files. Not sure where to go from here. Any help would be really appreciated!


I've included the chalmers model as an example here: [https://files.fm/u/hb45rp8z](https://files.fm/u/hb45rp8z)

Thank you again!
