- Post Title: iCarly 2 IJTC - unpacking *.pak files with quickBMS?

I've been researching but with every method I've tried I can't get this .pak open. [http://www105.zippyshare.com/v/iBiw7wWg/file.html](http://www105.zippyshare.com/v/iBiw7wWg/file.html)
I heard .pak can be opened with quickBMS scripts but the ones I've tried have not worked.

The full name of the game is:

iCarly 2: iJoin the Click!

Can I get some help, please and thanks?
