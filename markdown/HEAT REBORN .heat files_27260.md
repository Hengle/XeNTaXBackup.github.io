- Post Title: HEAT REBORN .heat files

Not sure if anyone has had a look at [https://www.heatreborn.com/en/](https://www.heatreborn.com/en/) but it's a Source engine game and all the game data is stored in .heat files.

At a glance it's either compressed or encrypted. FileSystem_stdio.dll doesn't have anything obvious (just all the usual Source .vpk/.zip/.xzp strings) but the header seems to be:
HeatFS
HEAT REBORN RESOURCE FILE
