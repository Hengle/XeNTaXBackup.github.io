- Post Title: PES 2011 language files (Zlib)

Hi all!

Can anyone tell me how to edit language files from PES 2011 (bin files) without characters limit. I know how to edit them but when I want to translate word "No" to my language I have just 2 places for characters and it contains 3 (Nie). 

Any ideas?

P.S. Sorry about my english but this is not my native language.
