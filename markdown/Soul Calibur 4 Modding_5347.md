- Post Title: Soul Calibur 4 Modding

I can't figure out how to mod the perks(Abilitys) of a character using the code. Such as I want my custom character to have the S ability(s), but I can't figure out how to do that. I also don't know how to code hexadecimal. If anyone could help it would be greatly appreciated. =D

You don't code hexdecimal. Hex is just a way of representing data. It's the same as saying you dont know how to code words. Words are just a way of representing an idea just as Hex is a way of representing numbers.

But I understand what you meant and as a real reply:

AFAIK there isn't a way to add your own abilities to Soul Calibur 4.

I know that I can't add my own powers I'm just asking how to modify the existing code so that my character can have a style like Darth Vader or Algol. I'm not sure where to find the files on how to modify these objects.

In most cases the game formats arent understood enough to do that. Extracting files is one thing but replacing files is another story. You either need to find someone who is able to reverse file formats for you or just play wif what you got.
