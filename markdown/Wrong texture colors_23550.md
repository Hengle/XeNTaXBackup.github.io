- Post Title: Wrong texture colors

After ripping some Unity models from an Android app using Asset Studio, some of the extracted textures seem to have the wrong colors, for example, the attached image should have a normal skin color, but instead it's full of blues and greens.
I believe this happens because the model's colors are switchable in-game, but I have no idea how to fix it. Any help would be appreciated.
