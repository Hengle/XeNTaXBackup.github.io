- Post Title: New Post, Request on Ripping Gangstar 4 Rio: City of Saints

Hello researchers,

I am Ribby, and I want to have @ least the sprites of Gameloft's top-down gta style "Gangstar 4 Rio: City of Saints". The game got detailed sprites and I want to have it. Of course, I am not sure if screenshoting is good enough? Maybe there is other files like audio that I can make use of. The other Gangstar and Alien Quarantine top-down titles are also of interest.

Is what I requesting legal enough? Etc? I can provide the files if necessary.

Moved to the correct forum. You can upload some file somewhere that you think the graphics are in and people can have a look-see.

Yes sir, as requested. [link](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/3531217/vg-resourcestuff/java_mobile_games_rip_assist_requiredv%23%23_stuff/java_mobile_games_rip_assist_required.7z)

Yeah, I could just screenshot and rip from the screens (which takes some dedication and time), but there are some actions (pain state) that are overlapping with other sprites, none which of any screenshot to be able to render.
I was about to mention Briganty too, but I guess finding out if the character sprites are cut off would be too much trouble.
Dang, this site is like those real live old skool hacker scene stuff, with the roms and music sequencers stuff.
