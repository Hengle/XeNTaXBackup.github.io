Here is the model files from old but good medal of honor. Will be great if some one could make plugin for Noesis, blender, 3ds max for this.
I'm interesting in models with skeletons and weights. Also converting of animation will be great.

Never figured out how to parse the bone structs and didn't know how to get the number of vertices/indices.
