- Post Title: Gust .LZR Format

Hello there!

I was wondering if someone can help me with this  format. Those files are from Gust games, such  Ar tonelico or Atelier Iris. If I'm not wrong, it seems to be these file are RLE encoded, but I don't know really. Thanks in advance.

Ah, thanks WRS! and sorry  . But it is possible to convert the source of that tool into a bms script?, because batch processing doesn't work for me. I've unpacked the RPK file from Atelier Iris Eternal Mana and I've got a bunch of files and I'm quite lazy to decompress one by one. Thanks anyways   .
