This is the wavefront-obj of the item, which you can import using blender: [http://www.uploadmb.com/dw.php?id=1352921744](http://www.uploadmb.com/dw.php?id=1352921744)

Texture coords are included so assigning 0092990019.bmp to the model in blender is the thing I left to you.

It is the same format of "Zero of the World".
You may try my FatImporter and select "Zero of the World 天上人間" if you have 3dsmax.
