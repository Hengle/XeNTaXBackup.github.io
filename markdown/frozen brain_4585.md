but when i sit at my pc i feel my brain is frozen and i have no sense anymore while so far it was charming for me , and only face of persons that i hate them appears constantly ...

it can be very hard going through depression.
I know it may seem hopeless but never give up.
I find everyone needs interaction with other people or animals.
I know one of the best things is when i am alone i always have my dogs there with me and they always know how to cheer me up.
they do not care what i have done they just show me kindness.
I also pray for help when all seems lost and I have never been let down.
I hope this can help a little and I wish you well.
