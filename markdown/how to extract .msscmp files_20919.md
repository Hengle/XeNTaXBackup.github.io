This QuickBMS script should extract the audio files from that archive:


# Minecraft MSSCMP extract

IDString "BANK"

Goto 0x18
Get FILE_TABLE Long
ReverseLong FILE_TABLE

Goto 0x34
Get ENTRIES Long
ReverseLong ENTRIES


For A = 1 to ENTRIES

	Goto FILE_TABLE
	Get FOLDERNAME_OFF Long
	ReverseLong FOLDERNAME_OFF
	Get FILE_INFO Long
	ReverseLong FILE_INFO

	Goto FILE_INFO
	Get JUNK Long
	Get FILENAME_OFF Long
	ReverseLong FILENAME_OFF
	Math FILENAME_OFF + FILE_INFO
	Get OFFSET Long
	Get JUNK Long
	Get JUNK Long
	Get SAMP_RATE Long
	ReverseLong SAMP_RATE
	Get SIZE Long
	ReverseLong SIZE

	Goto FOLDERNAME_OFF
	Get FOLDER_NAME String
	Goto FILENAME_OFF
	Get FILENAME String

	String FOLDER_NAME + "\"
	String FOLDER_NAME + FILENAME

	Log FOLDER_NAME OFFSET SIZE

	Math FILE_TABLE + 8

Next A
