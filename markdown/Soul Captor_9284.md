English server is doing closed-beta but chinese version is available for DL: [http://tw.beanfun.com/SC/index.aspx](http://tw.beanfun.com/SC/index.aspx)



I don't think this is actually a model in the game though.
Probably the small one behind it LOL

Anyways the archives are split in 100 MB pieces. Data at the top, table at the end. The filenames are all encrypted, but it looks like just some XOR

Textures are mostly DDS. There are some bmp and tga files around, but it's probably for CG and stuff.
Model format doesn't look too difficult.

Most of the data is unprotected.

lol I guess the girl in the CG probably created the world or something and the players are controlling those dolls.
