- Post Title: [help][.pack] GunDog [2012][Torque 3D]

So I discovered one game from 2012, which has shut down in same year. By accident I discovered it in my old HDD in around 2021.

So when I used usual offzip command -a, I managed to get both textures and sounds just fine, but model files were displayed as .dat files, and I have zero clue how do I make it readable.

When I looked into .dat files through Hex editor, there seems to be some bone names in certain .dat files either in start or end of file, or none at all, but I can't seem to understand anything else.

Here I share these .pack files.

I also put 10 sample .dat files zip.

I suppose that:
GGDC_1 main menu assets
GGDCH_1 character assets
GGDM_1 map assets
GGDS_1 sound assets
GGDW_1 weapon assets
