This seems to be a fulltime job.

Did you contact NFITC1 concerning your request?

Maybe the WM sources might be helpful. I read [http://wmprc.blogspot.de/2013/01/after- ... onths.html](http://wmprc.blogspot.de/2013/01/after-how-many-months.html).
He's talking about WM source and then "Still, it's mostly ready for release."
So you might ask him what "release" is refering to. The "exe" or the source.

That the source of WM might be helpful to get an idea how to create an editor for the "System.bin" file of Dissidia 012?

I did contact him and he's interested, after all 
someone else, however, could help?

Should I upload the .bin file here, so that people know what I am talking about?

EDIT: in any case, here it is.
