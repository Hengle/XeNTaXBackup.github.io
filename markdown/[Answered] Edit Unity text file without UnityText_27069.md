- Post Title: [Answered] Edit Unity text file without UnityText?

Hello,

I am translating a Unity Android game, I extract the text (.dat) file from resources.assets with UABEA but unfortunately [UnityText](https://forum.zoneofgames.ru/topic/47582-unitytext/) can't open all .dat file, (not recognize the text on those file) just a few.
Is there any other similar program like UnityText or any other way to edit those file? (if I edit the files with notepad++ the game not start, Unity Text 2 works well if it can open .dat files)

There is the picture of 2 files, one of them where it's working, and the other it's not.

I've personally never worked on mobily game localization yet.
So while I can't be 100% sure, I'm guessing the big picture must be the same.
Judging from your attachment and pictures, do you have access to resources.assets?
Instead of extracting ~~~resources.assets-27.dat (raw format data), open resources.assets with UABEA, look for the asset you wish to edit, and export dump in either txt/json. You can edit the exported txt/json, and the insert it back with the import dump feature.

Thank you, the export dump (txt), modify the file and import dump works perfectly.
