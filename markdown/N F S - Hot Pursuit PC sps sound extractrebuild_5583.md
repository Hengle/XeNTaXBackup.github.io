Hi
I worked with this program and got a good result almost.
But when the game seems like it sounds obscure player makes.
If someone could also solve the problem make me I'm grateful.

Afaik the game itself can't have music added to it, unless you know which file contains the list of music, know how to add it (most likely with hex code), modify the song name, have it detect that song, apply sound filters for certain events (e.g. entering cooldown), etc.

Yeah, unless you REALLY know how to work with hex code, you can only replace songs in the game.
