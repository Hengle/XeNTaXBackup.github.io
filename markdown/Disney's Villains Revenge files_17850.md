I was wondering if anyone could help me extract or do something else with the files from this game. The main ones are .trak, .shop, .stag and .move. So can anyone help me?

Here's a link to some of these files: [https://drive.google.com/file/d/13qCFrR ... sp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/13qCFrR7zKZU6BDZFKMctYUVxVQEkYM-Y/view?usp=sharing)

(Update: As of March 24th, 2018, this link is dead.)

Here's a BMS script that will break the archives into smaller files named with a file ID.

Now, about the .SPRI, .SOUN and .POSE files. Can they be converted? Here are the files produced that need to be converted: [https://drive.google.com/open?id=1LuqXR ... yls2Jj9d42](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1LuqXRrQ8gNhlrYIsZ_hSJ3yls2Jj9d42)

Just make clear what you're actually looking for. Models? Textures? I won't waste any time on some aimless activities.

Sounds and sprites, now is it possible for you to help me with proper conversions? All I get is static when I put it in Audacity, but I can still hear the voices within it.

I don't know. Maybe you'll get some help if you make a new post at the audio file formats section.
