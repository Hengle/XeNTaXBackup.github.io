- Post Title: Encrypted asset file(all in one)

Hi,
The all assets are in one file, maybe it's encrypted. It's named .mp3, but obviously, it's a asset file. I haven't found any useful information in this file. And I researched a lot found the program load this file on a vfs. I hope I can get some help.

Any help is appreciate.

Asset File(.mp3):
