- Post Title: Change.org petition for Mediatek to comply with the GPL.

Sorry if I'm soliciting or rallying for support here, but I just felt that MediaTek's doing it wrong, and as what Nvidia recently did, MTK needs to change their business model if they don't want to be viewed with acrimony by the open-source community.
