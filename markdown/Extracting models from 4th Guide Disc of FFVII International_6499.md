- Post Title: Extracting models from 4th Guide Disc of FFVII International

So I've managed to acquire the 4th Disc of the FFVII International version. There are some nice models I bet we could use in the PC version, like the buggy, the Shin-Ra Sub, or the Tiny Bronco, the Highwind, even a nicer snowboard... except I can't seem to figure what program could extract the models.
