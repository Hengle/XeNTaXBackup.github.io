- Post Title: Model extracting from Unity mobile game - a tutorial?

Hello. I am interested in trying to obtain some models and textures of some characters from the game Darkness Rises, though I have hit a snag on trying to do so. To explain, I have done some research on it, with Darkness Rises being an Unity engine based game tied to the mobile platform, which makes things a little technical. 
I have tried using an old version of the Nox emulator as well as Ninja Ripper to try and rip the models, though this didn't really work out too well. I have also transferred some of the data (com.nexon...) and using AssetStudio to extract things via that way, but it doesn't produce any sort of results either. So I'm kind of at a loss on what to do.

Is there anyone that is knowledgeable on extracting material from this game or mobile games in general? Are there any tips or tutorials that someone could write/link me to so I can perform this myself? Thanks for reading.

you need to open the cache in Asset Studio, not the apk ... the cache path  (SDcard or Mobile/android/data/com.nexon.da3.global)

Does this apply for games like Call of Duty Mobile that download assets in the main menu of the game?

Yeah so small problem, Asset Studio doesnt display Texture 2D for Call of Duty Mobile and won't let me export the models and textures either. Apparently only DevX Studio works with CoDM.
