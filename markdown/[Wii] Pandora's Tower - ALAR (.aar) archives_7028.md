the wii emulator dolphin has a texture dump feature and then you can even have it use your modded textures you put back into the game on the emulator.
I do not think anyone will make a re-packer for this but the images look like a ton of VERY small dds files.

The game doesn't run well in Dolphin for me, so that's not an option, but I am interested in what you said about the images. Are you talking about the "ALIG" files or the "ALMT" files?

I cant say anything about the fileformat of the files inside the archive but the archiveformat itself was explained here: [http://jumpstars.wikispaces.com/File+Formats](http://jumpstars.wikispaces.com/File+Formats) and in the forum.
