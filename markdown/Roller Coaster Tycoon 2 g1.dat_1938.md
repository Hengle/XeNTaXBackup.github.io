- Post Title: Roller Coaster Tycoon 2 g1.dat?

I found that you have support for Roller Coaster Tycoon css.dat files, but not rct2 g1 dats.

The whole RCT community would be extremely grateful.


I cut a sliver of the file using a file cutter.


Thanks!

Sorry for the late response, but other chores are taking up all of my time.

See [http://www.xentax.com/?p=90](http://www.xentax.com/?p=90)

But when I'm done with that, I will go through the requests and check if I can help out.
