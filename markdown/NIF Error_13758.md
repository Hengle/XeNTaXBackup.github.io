- Post Title: NIF Error

I was able to extract the black prophecy archive. When I try to open the .nif I get this error.

""failed to load file header (version 14030009, 20.3.0.9)"" 
"failed to load nif from 'I:/Program Files (x86)/Gamigo/Black Prophecy Client/GFX/STATIC/ASTEROIDS/LAVA/asteroid_field_lava_005.nif'" 

[http://speedy.sh/3Xaez/F1-drone-001.nif](http://speedy.sh/3Xaez/F1-drone-001.nif) Here's the file.
