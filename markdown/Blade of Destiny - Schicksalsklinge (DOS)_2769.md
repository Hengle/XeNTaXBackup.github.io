We made some progress with *.nvf files: [http://freedsa.schattenkind.net/index.php/NVF](http://freedsa.schattenkind.net/index.php/NVF)

But this files are unknown:
[http://freedsa.schattenkind.net/index.php/TAB](http://freedsa.schattenkind.net/index.php/TAB)

```
ANIS <- Data

MFIGS.TAB
MFIGS

MONSTER.TAB
MONSTER

WFIGS.TAB
WFIGS

```


It seems, that the tab file (ANIS.TAB) is a table with data for reading or unpacking the mainfile (ANIS).

Hey Mr.Mouse you can help?

We already decoded most of the datafile formats. But the 8bit gfx format files are maybe compressed. We realy need this to step forward in out project.
