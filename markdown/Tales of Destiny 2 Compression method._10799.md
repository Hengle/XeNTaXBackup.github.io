- Post Title: Tales of Destiny 2 Compression method.

I'm no good at understanding compression method and I couldn't trace back the code to find its routine. But I do have a compressed/uncompressed file to work with.

I was wandering if someone could help me understanding it so I can make a little program for it.

Edit: Since I have the answer, the Thread can be closed ^^
Thanks !
