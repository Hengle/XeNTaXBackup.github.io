Use Falo's QuickBMS scripts with QuickBMS to dump the pmo's and tm2's found here: [viewtopic.php?f=16&t=4501&p=39125#p39125](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=4501&p=39125#p39125)

Honestly if you know what format these were you probably read the Birth By Sleep thread. And you should have asked this there not in a separate topic.

I don't mind much. Looking back at your posts history it appears you did ask 3 times in that thread but it wasn't until the last time that you seemed clear to me. None the less you could have just quoted yourself or tried asking again while being more clear. But since you made a new topic you may as well use it. 

I would assume you figured it out then?

Well then are you sure you didn't extract them several times or something? That or they really are just 300 megabytes rather than 300 gigabytes. I'm most certain they didn't take anywhere near that amount of space upon extraction.
