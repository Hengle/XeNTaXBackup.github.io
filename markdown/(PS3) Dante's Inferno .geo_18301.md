- Post Title: (PS3) Dante's Inferno .geo

Hi, i've been working on extracting Dante's Inferno archives and it's files, .viv, .str, as i was successful with Rick's Visceral Games Tool.

However i was searching for Dead Space .geo importing tools, i've spent searching places to import it, but no success. I'm not really a programmer or hex editor, but i managed to get the textures .tg4d using TextureFinder V21.

I believe the game has similiar engine along the previous game developed by Visceral Games, like Dead Space. But the other tools created by people for Dead Space didn't support Dante's Inferno file formats.


In which now, i was able to get the files, "Also working video files .vp6". Now to figure out to import the models. I probably think it's the .geo files are the mesh. Few people managed to get the models, but is there a way to import these mesh files?. I'm so close retrieving the models

"Yes the game is like 8 years old. But i hope we could atleast manage this by supporting"

If you have 3ds max you can use this script. This was written a while ago so there may still be some bugs.

Thank you so much!, it works anyway.

I assume this one is optional, but will there be a way to import the skeletons?. If not, no worries then.

I think skeletons are in a different file. If you have a samples I can take a look at them. Chances are they're the same or nearly the same as Dead Space's skeleton files. I haven't been able to figure out how Visceral Games' skinning works so you'll have to skin it yourself.

The skeleton files are the .rcb.xen/ps3 files.

Script, with weights and bones support. Use it as it is - for now, I can't fix it because of my PC problems:( So, there will be no respond to bug report.

UPD: Some fixes

You need to compile those tools with Visual Studio. I used the 2017 version.

I know this is old but I'm just getting into this game.  Rick's github page seems to be missing some stuff.  Does anyone happen to have a compiled version of the Gibbed.Visceral tool anymore?

Hi! Thanks for your work, I would like to know how to get the .PS3 file? I used 3dmax2018, but this script doesn't recognize .ps3. How can I get the texture of the model?

grateful! I'm asking for your help here, the .geo script is not working erratically on new pc systems, I keep getting errors that I have to restart 3dsmax after successfully importing a mesh. If you can, can you create a noesis script, it would be a pain to look at like this
