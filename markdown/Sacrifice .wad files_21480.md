- Post Title: Sacrifice .wad files

Hello, I just installed XentaX MultiEx Commander since I couldn't find other programs to do it (I heard that Jaeder Naub was other choice, but I couldn't find a download anywhere) but there seems to be a problem with the program. I can't extract those .wad files if I try to use QuickBMS script, I get an error message reading "QBMS failed to produce list!".

I bought Sacrifice from GOG.com by the way.
