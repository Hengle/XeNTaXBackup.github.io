Hey, is there any proven way to package an android .obb file? Simply opening it in 7zip as an archive and replacing the translated files will prevent the game from starting.

That depends on the game. In many cases you can just edit content with 7zip or Winrar 
and game will load without any issues.

But in some cases there might occur some CRC checks or encryption methods.

I tried Deus Ex the Fall a long time ago and replacing files after opening the archive with 7zip causes the game to not load.
