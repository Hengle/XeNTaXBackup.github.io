PYC usually stands for "Python compiled", are you sure RPYC is not just a PYC file renamed?

It may be a little late,but I think that I can help you.
I have written a tutorial for translating RenPy games and dealing with RPYC files.
You can find it here [http://ikskoks.pl/poradnik-5-spolszczen ... iku-renpy/](http://ikskoks.pl/poradnik-5-spolszczenia-do-gier-na-silniku-renpy/)
It's in polish, but there are images there. 

Brak plików „.rpy” ---> # Drugi sposób #  It is the section where you should look.
