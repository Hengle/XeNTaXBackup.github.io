- Post Title: Extracting .STR & .STH Audio Pairs

I've found an incomplete of Pac-Man World 3 (PS2) & House of the Dead Overkill (Wii) which both use .STR & .STH pairs but no way to extract them from binaries. I'm currently trying to rip Pac-Man World 3 (GC) which seem to use .STRs like the ps2 version but have no idea how I would extract them.
