- Post Title: WRC 7 .paf files

I know this uses FMOD and all, but is this trivial enough to extract, and if possible, encode new sounds in place of the default ones? Yeah the handling in this game is indeed shite, but one area this can be improved upon is the co-driver voice.

Here are the files in case anyone's interested:
