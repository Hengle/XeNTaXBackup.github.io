- Post Title: Granado Espada to 3dmax

Sorry if this info is posted elsewhere, as I have yet to find. Does anyone know how to import Sword of the New World models into 3d max. I found and have been able to extract the files from the game but as yet have had not luck in being able to get them into max (max 2010). Thanks in advance for anyone that can help.

Did you think for the Granado Espada .lma files ?

The 3D Object Converter supports this file type for load.
[http://web.t-online.hu/karpo](http://web.t-online.hu/karpo)

Please install the v4.40 or use the v4.40 portable version.
After that you must upgrade to v4.412 using the Help/Check for updates... function.

See this nice gallery (original .lma and the converted Wavefront .obj/mtl files):

I think you did not upgrade your 3D O. C. v4.40 to V4.418.

You can do it using the Help/Check for updates... function.

After that you can open the .lma files with the 3D O. C.
