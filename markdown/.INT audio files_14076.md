- Post Title: .INT audio files?

Hello! I was trying to get the music from a PS2 videogame (concretely One Piece: Round The Land!), which I had played long time ago and still play sometimes. The problem with that is that, while I think the audio files the game uses can be found on its .ISO, all I can find inside the "bgm" folder in it (as opened by WinRAR) are .INT files.

All I can find on the Internet regarding this file format is just a definition of what it is and lists of software able to open it which I do not know at all so I'm not resolved to install. I was wondering if I could get some help regarding this issue. If needed, I can get the "bgm" folder out of the .ISO file, make it a .RAR and upload it somewhere so you can lend me a hand. It would be awesome!

Thank you so much for your time an attention! Have a nice day!

Upload a sample file for the community to take a look at

Hope this works :_D

Here are random .INT files chosen within the "bgm" folder:
-> [http://www.mediafire.com/download/k03m5 ... /02_b0.int](http://www.mediafire.com/download/k03m5sxqat3iti7/02_b0.int) (from the subfolder "0" within)
-> [http://www.mediafire.com/download/eodk8 ... /05_02.int](http://www.mediafire.com/download/eodk8g4f6lhpkbi/05_02.int) (from the subfolder "1")
-> [http://www.mediafire.com/download/4lq1k ... /09_b1.int](http://www.mediafire.com/download/4lq1ka1uxl52zio/09_b1.int) (from the subfolder "1")
-> [http://www.mediafire.com/download/wec8x ... /cd_07.int](http://www.mediafire.com/download/wec8x94r2dkzanr/cd_07.int) (from the subfolder "2")

I tried to take files with different names from the three different directories inside "bgm"

Thank you so much

Plain PCM (Little endian), stereo, interleaved by 0x200 bytes

Can be decoded with VGMToolbox, but maybe there are simpler options...

There is BMS script for deinterleaving, but this may be more difficult.

I have the program (VGMToolbox) already, but I don't know how to use it, honestly :_D

This is all I got so far:



How do I use it to decode the .INT's :_D ?

Thank you so much for everything

Choose GENH, then RAW PCM and the parameters I mentioned. Also "no loops", then you'll get the file playable with VGMStream

Thank you  ! Must I do it by creating a GENH, by extracting a GENH or by editting a GENH? First I thought the obvious choice was to extract one but then I don't get the options you mentioned :_D I'll try to create one and just drag and drop the .INT in the file box and see what happens ^^'

This is what I get so far:



Thank you so much  !

EDIT. I tried, but I lack the "channels" and "frequency" fields. What should I set in them? Is it important :_D ?
EDIT (2). I set random values for both and got the .GENH files. Is there any way to convert them to any more playable format such as .MP3 or .WAV?

stereo = 2 channels

you can play genh with VGMStream (or convert to wav)

Well, I used VGSC to convert it because I had it already :_D

Still, once I had the channels, I tried different frequencies and always got it slower, with 48000 I had it just right ^^ ! I'm the happiest thing alive right now  !

Thank you so so so so so so much for everything ><  !
