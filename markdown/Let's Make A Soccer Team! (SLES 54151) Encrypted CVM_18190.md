- Post Title: Let's Make A Soccer Team! (SLES 54151) Encrypted CVM

Hello, I've been trying to find the password for Let's Make A Soccer Team's encrypted CVM for about 2 hours now by looking in the binary hex code, but have had no luck. Searching for "ROFS", "Data.CVM" and "ADXF_AddRofsVol" with little success at finding a plausible encryption key string around those areas. Maybe some fresh eyes will help, so I'm asking you guys to give me a hand if you have a copy of this (admittedly niche) gane. All I really wanna do is change team logos to real logos and a few other tweaks. haha

Thanks in advance.
