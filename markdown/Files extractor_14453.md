- Post Title: Files extractor

Help create the extractor for game files, preferably in the simplest way and to be able to extract the files of more than 10 GB.

I searched the whole Internet, but no one knows anything, and those who know, hide this secret as finding evidence of aliens on Mars.

And here's where to download QApiTrace? Nowhere is there!

Locking this.

This sub-forum is dedicated to game-specific tools. You have been very vague on what you need help with here and did not provide any details about the game in question.
