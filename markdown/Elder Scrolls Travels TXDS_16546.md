- Post Title: Elder Scrolls Travels TXDS

Hey Folks long time lurker, first time poster here. I have been working on archiving data and modding the builds that were leaked of The Elder Scrolls Travels Oblivion for the PSP. I have had success in most realms except with the textures. I have tried countless TXD tools, and even editing them by hand so the format resembles a more common format with no success. Can anyone shed some light on the format of the texture dictionaries? Or know of any tools that may work? For the record the format is the same as Silent Hill Origins and Ghost Rider for PSP. I have included a link to a TXD from the game.
