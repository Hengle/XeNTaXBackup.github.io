Static meshes use nif version 20.3.0.9, viewable in Nifskope.

Skeletal meshes use some custom format, I didn't see anyone finish any tools for them, which is too bad some of them are nice.

edit: oh yeah, I forgot, the textures extract as "dtx" files or something, but they're just dds files that need to be renamed.
