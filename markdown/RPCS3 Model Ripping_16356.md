- Post Title: RPCS3 Model Ripping?

Considering RPCS3 can play Heavy Rain now I figured I'd download it and give it a shot, the game works fine but the real reason I even bothered was for the game's models. Alas, GLXtractor and the other plethora of tools couldn't do anything about it.

Is there any sort of tool out there that can hook OpenGL 4.3 x64, for the sake of dumping geometry?
Or, is there any sort of tool that can hook Vulkan or DirectX12 for the sake of dumping geometry?

Try Renderdoc. It should be able to do Vulcan from what I've seen.

Gave it a shot with OpenGL and Vulkan last night, doesn't work on the games I tried it on, it just captures it asthough its an image, textures and meshes aren't captured at all.

It may work on other games, I can't say, it depends how they're implemented the renderer.
