- Post Title: PS4 Crash Team Racing Nitro Fueled - Extracting FPKG .pak file

I need help extracting a .pak file that is 4GB that when I try to use a program to extract it I get this error:

The output char buffer is too small to contain the decoded characters, encoding 'Unicode (UTF-8)' fallback 'System.Text.DecoderReplacementFallback'.
Parameter name: chars


If anyone knows how to fix this error or knows how to extract .pak files with this error message me and I'll send you the file.

4GB .pak file is from PS4 Crash Team Racing Nitro Fueled V1.20 FPKG & the error occurs when attempting to open the 4GB .pak file in the NST PAK Explorer "Nitro Fueled Edition"

You need to specify more details:

1. What is the name of the game this file comes from?
2. What is the version of the game this file comes from?
3. Is it FPKG for PS3 modded consoles?
4. How did you get this file?
5. What is the "program" you were using?

You can also post a samples using file cutter [viewtopic.php?t=6747](https://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?t=6747)
