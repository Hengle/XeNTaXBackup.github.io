How to decompress gmo&gim in a pac, by the way?
gmo&gim in a pac file is compressed.

in my case, i used "unpac" tool, which was written by a coder from a Chinese localization workgroup. (tools and src here:[http://leoheart.blog43.fc2.com/?mode=edit&rno=2150](http://leoheart.blog43.fc2.com/?mode=edit&rno=2150), in a MF link, u can't miss it)

btw, i just learned Noesis is actually using mesh2rdm to load, preview and export models. 

Besides, i found "PSPSDK" from pudn, which contents some GMO code. but still no clue how to work with that.   i'm n00b..

Wow!  That's cool! I'm beginning to suspect that mesh2rdm reads meshes well but get wrong with the bone, pose/animation data! --since 3DVIA Printscreen got it right!
I tried GameAssassin but no luck.
Anyway i'll try what u said and say thanks

Hmm I tried to unpac it but the filesizes seem a lot smaller than the files you uploaded (all of them are about 1/3 the size)

Is it for a specific version of the game? I'm just dropping pac files over the unpac'er.

oic, u must have missed the "-z" parameter. so u got files in compression. run a cmd or .bat like this:
unpac -z myfiles\ch01a_base.pac
 i know this cuz that tool is in and for Chinese.

..wait a minute, i'm not sure it's applicable 4 other games.
For NanohaAs Portable, .pac files has a header of "ADD", and each compressed file it contents begins with a "LZS" header.
[viewtopic.php?f=10&t=6474](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=6474) u may take a view of this .pac format with LZS compression here.

missing UV map

u should write a .skinmap for mesh2rdm, drag-n-drop there. then ripping with 3DVia PrintScr can keep the UV map.

Mesh2rdm newer versions won't work. Even in older versions, must not draw skeleton.
So it's a pity that i cannot get bone/animation right now.

Shamal in ms3d!!

you can use the noesis data viewer to edit each bone rotation and position (offset) to fix the mesh skeleton and get the mesh back to what it should look

ah, that's probably why.
I didn't realize there were options lol

I wonder if the sequel just re-uses models.

 What?! u must be joking! So what's that game on PC exactly? tell me the name plz  
probably u're referring to Magical Battle Arena by Flysystem/AreaZero. that's a doujinshi game on PC using .x uncompressed in .gpk archives.

Whose hair?  

i believe it's located somewhere else, perhaps near the origin.
just take Shamal for example:

seems the front hair's missing, but in fact it's located near her pelvis, mostly inside of her clothes.

u can move it manually to its proper position. So there shouldn't be any mesh missing.
