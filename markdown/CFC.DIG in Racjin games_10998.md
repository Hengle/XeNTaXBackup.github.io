- Post Title: CFC.DIG in Racjin games

Can anyone code me or recommend me a tool that can handle the CFC.DIG file? Especially in the PS2 game, Bleach: Blade Battlers 2nd and the PSP game, Bleach: Soul Carnival 2. *.DIG files are used for various data compression. Kinda how a *.CPK is used (my guess).
Thank you.
