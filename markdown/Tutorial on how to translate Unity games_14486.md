- Post Title: Tutorial on how to translate Unity games?

Is there any tutorial about how to translate Unity games out there?
I found a lot of resources to reverse engineer / unpack Unity files, but no organized step-to-step tutorial to localization or sub translation.
Do you know of something I can study?
I know every game's different, but the approaches, workflow and steps should be more or less the same.
Thanks guys!
