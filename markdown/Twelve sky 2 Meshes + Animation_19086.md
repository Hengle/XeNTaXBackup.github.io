- Post Title: Twelve sky 2 Meshes + Animation

I'm trying to combine twelvesky 2 animations with meshes . I've added samples below. How can I open and analyze them(Maya, Blender, 3dsMax vs). I'm waiting for your help. Thank you.

Model_Files.zip:


includes Model_Files.zip:
1-) Original " .MOTION extension files" -> This is  animation files  and I think bones contain
2-) Original ".SOBJECT files" -> Meshes
3-) Opened SOBJECT files -> includes .OBJ Format Models and .dds images (I opened with the help of  @zaramot. Very thanks again)

Sample: Meshes and Textures. No animation
