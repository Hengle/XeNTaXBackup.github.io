- Post Title: Legend of Mana remaster (PC, .psb.m files)

Hello there people!

Legend of Mana just released on PC as a remaster, and I thought I'd translate it. It has the text files/strings stored in .psb.m files, don't know what to do with them. Here's the english file -> [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gJbCS8 ... sp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gJbCS8tsxNv6Gz3-c5PPqkdm6fP_74EJ/view?usp=sharing)

Thanks, but I can't seem to unpack or edit the file, don't know what I'm doing wrong.

EDIT: Nevermind, got info that these files can be edited with FreeMote, using it right now.

I'm translating this game too here, did you manage to extract the texture files on it?
I only could extract the text file with FreeMote

I tried to use FreeMote here to extract one texture earlier, but it's kinda glichy the result that FreeMote gave to me
Someone know how to extract properly or convert this glichy image in a normal image?

Textures from PC version? I exported textures only from Switch version and they have ASTC format and FreeMote can't correctly convert it to png format. You need to extract DDS data from this files and it can be vewed in NVIDIA Texture Tools Exporter, for example
