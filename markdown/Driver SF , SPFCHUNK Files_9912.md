Hey Guys! My friend has been doing some research on the *.fchunk/*.sp format of Driver: SF. He has managed to extract some sounds, DDS, etc. And has made a program to analyze files. He has also said that extraction may be coming soon!

Here is a pic of his program:


I'll update you guys with news as he investigates more. He isn't registered here because of the donation stuff. but I'll update you guys.

Great progress so far, WRS! Since my friend's tool works with DSF files, the DRIV3R will be awesome if you manage to do model extraction aswell:P

If you would actually take the time to read my thread, it also applies to your "SP/FCHUNK" files because they're the same thing. It's called the Reflections CHUNK file format and the only difference between DRIV3R, Driver: Parallel Lines, and Driver: San Francisco is the content inside. This thread should be included in my thread that's down below since there's literally no different between them (my thread is based on DRIV3R research which is relevant to the other games as well).

Alright, I would request a moderator to merge this thread with CarLuver69's CHUNK research thread please. Thanks!
