I'm trying to figure out how to unpack .bin files from PSP world superbike games, tried to use tools like daemon, power iso and other regular .bin unpacker apps but didn't work, any clue what tool should I use?

Here's an example of the file (allbikes.bin) there's also a file called allbikes.ptr and I think those two files are linked together in some way
