- Post Title: Myth 1, 2 Audio Compression?

.gor|.tag unpackers for Windows avaliable here - [http://hl.udogs.net/files/Uploads/%20Us ... s/editors/](http://hl.udogs.net/files/Uploads/%20User%20Uploads/Fidelix%20uploads/editors/)
Resources dont have compression, as I can understand.
Audio has compression or audio encoder, because dont decodes normally as RAW.
Few samples - <removed due forum rules violation>
Looking a tool|way for decode and/or converting.
