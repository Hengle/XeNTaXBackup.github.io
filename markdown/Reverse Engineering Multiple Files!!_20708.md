- Post Title: Reverse Engineering Multiple Files!!

Hello everyone, I am trying to figure out how YGO: Legacy of the Duelist links all of it's card files together, I've managed to make some progress on figuing out how the game works, but I am a bit lost on how it links the cards.

The IDA dump of the function I think loading them is here: 

The files are here: 
Could someone explain how it's linking all of them or if you need more information, I can't seem to find anything, I've renamed some variables in my IDA dump to make sure I remember what they all do so hopefully they help.
