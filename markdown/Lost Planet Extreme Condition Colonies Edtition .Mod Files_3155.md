- Post Title: Lost Planet Extreme Condition Colonies Edtition .Mod Files

Hello,

Has anyone had a look at the Lost Planet Extreme Condition Colonies Edtition .Mod Files? Attached are a couple for anyone to look at.

As a related aside, Lost Planet .Tex files can be extracted and converted to .dds using the excellent Jader Naub tool, and of course both of these files can be extracted from the .arc files using the also excellent [http://www.xentax.com/uploads/author/itg/lparcext.rar](http://www.xentax.com/uploads/author/itg/lparcext.rar).  That just leaves us with the .mod geometry files to complete the puzzle.

edit: looks like I can't attach the files as all extensions are "not allowed". I've uploaded the files here instead:
