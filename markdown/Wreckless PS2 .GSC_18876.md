- Post Title: Wreckless PS2 .GSC

Files have header of NU20. TST0 seem to be textures.

Overall seems to be similar structure to this [http://aluigi.altervista.org/bms/gsc_nu20.bms](http://aluigi.altervista.org/bms/gsc_nu20.bms)

I've also uploaded the entire WRECKCITY to gdrive: [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LrcJOU ... sp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LrcJOUok_Ya7BT5uauitrUM-_ck4aQEU/view?usp=sharing)

Thanks in advance for any help!
