- Post Title: WIN98 WORK AROUND FOR VERSION 3.8

To Win98 users that suffered from a malicious install : 

Replace the .LST file after extraction of all setup files with this one and then run again. msvcrt.dll and scrrun.dll will now not be installed. Thus, your computer should work fine after install.  

If any other problems arise, please don't yell at me, just state them here. I appreciate any help, but it is still at your own risk. I edited and used this LST file on a WinNT system and the setup program now did not ask if i wanted to replace the system files and it installed fine. 

Here's the LST file :

So it worked on ric's win98 system now. Thanks for helping, ric!

Is there anyone else who experienced problems on win98 that are now fixed?
