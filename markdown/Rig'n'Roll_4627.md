- Post Title: Rig'n'Roll

Greetings,

I would like to translate Rig'n'Roll to my language, but game uses .pkqt files that I don't know how to edit. I think they are in archive, because files from "Loc" folder and files from "Wav" folder has nearly the same header.

Developers of this game said, that game can't be modded, but...


Can somebody look at that .pkqt files, please?

Thanks in advance

As far as I know pkqt are just java compiled classes/libraries.
