Thanks, but i pretty sure that he used 3d ripper for converting, just like I did:

mhm, noticed that the current 3dsimed can import tracks, interiors, several interior objects (these bonus things - dices, codemasterslogo and so on), the iphone

all things with textures inside the pssg

[http://img291.imageshack.us/i/intm.png/](http://img291.imageshack.us/i/intm.png/)

interior of that west coast chopper stuka

[http://img825.imageshack.us/i/iphone.png/](http://img825.imageshack.us/i/iphone.png/)

the iphone with dirt on it (more texture than mesh)

only the cars and some interiorbonusobjects wont work well
