- Post Title: Tekken 5 Dark Resurrection PS3 Models [Request]

I can't figure out how to rip the models from Tekken 5 Dark Resurrection since I cannot find a way to open the two T55Data.bin files. I believe that the files are encrypted. I mainly want Jinpachi (3 versions, human, "devil", and fire), Yoshimitsu, and Marshal Law (because of the mustache) since most of the models are pallet swaps of the characters from original Tekken 5. Plus, I can find higher quality versions of the rest of the characters from Tekken 6 or Tekken Tag Tournament 2. I may want the stage assets as well; additionally, I can upload the files if needed.
