- Post Title: [PS2/XBOX] - Convert VP6 videos

Guys, I'm in trouble here.
We have a project hack NFS ​​Most Wanted for PS2/XBOX.
What happens we already have all the tools ready, but the only difficulty is in the videos.
The videos are on TrueMotion VP6 format, what we would like is a tool to convert videos into an extension editable ex: MPG, AVI, WMV, etc ...
I searched the internet some program that made such a function, I found some tool, but only converted to AVI, VP6> AVI, but we need the inverse AVI> VP6.
Here more information about the extension and a website with examples of VP6 used in EA games.
