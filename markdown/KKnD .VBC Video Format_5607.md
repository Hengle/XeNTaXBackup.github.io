Some times ago known about MPlayer SIFF video support  start with 1.0rc3.

Found one of MPlayer versions, which can play all KKND .VBC movies, expect INTRO.VBC(indefinite video as MPEG-PS and stop). But sound play faster video.

Will be thanksful for special build of MPlayer with Mencoder for playing and decoding/demuxing KKND .VBC files.
