Hey guys.

Okay, I give up and ask here. Trying to get my avatar from SL into Blender to do a few renders.

I've used OGLE + GLIntercept ten years ago to capture my back then avatar and it worked fine, UVs and all (minus a billion hours of cleanup). All was well.

Today, no luck.

Used GLIntercept 0.5, recognizes OGLE but I only get empty file .obj files. Textures ok.
And GLIntercept 1.3.4 won't even load OGLE. Only textures.

Yes, I did pay attention to the bit version of GLIntercept, tried both the x86 and x64 SL client, tried an alternate client (Fire storm) both x86 and x64.

Also tried a few other stuff (cra0kalo's modded Intel Graphics Performance Analyzer, Dassault's 3D Printscreen). I'm at wit's end. Nothing works.

Ninjaripper doesn't do OpenGL, that's a no-go. 3D Ripper DX obviously too. I have the OGLE source code, but I may as well be looking at hieroglyphs, my highschool c++ doesn't cut it. 

Btw this isn't my first post here, but the thread I was most active in got nuked (Sketchsomethingsomething)
ps: I bought the model so don't @ me with copyright stuff.

I'm in precisely the same boat... Anyone have any suggestions?

We don't support asset ripping from sites, regardless of whether you've "bought" the assets or not. If you really have purchased them, but didn't get your own copy, that's an issue to take up with the assets' creators, or the site they're hosted on.
