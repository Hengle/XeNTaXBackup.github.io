Anyone have an unpacker for this game?
The models are standard GMO's

The archive is uncompressed/unencrypted with a separate file table.
GitMO can grab some GMO's but not all.

I've always wondered why these Japanese developers develop anime games for the PSP moreso than the PS3 or XBOX. If this was a PS3 or XBOX360 game I'd be on it in a heartbeat lol. Can you imagine a high-resolution model of Lucy ha ha ha? You'd probably go nuts with those tits finale ha ha ha . These Japanese developers need to stop with the PSP crap. Let it die already . Some of these anime games need some PS3 love badly.
