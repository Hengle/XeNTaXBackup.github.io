- Post Title: RoadHog META/RHM/MOPP import scripts

Formats used in Hard Reset and Shadow Warrior.

META/RHM are used on nonrigged meshes including maps.
MOPP colision model with generated MOPP code.

Full model and material support.
Tested on Hard Reset latest version (not Redux).

Sometimes you will need to multiply vertexcolor, to get nice blend results.
