Hey Everyone,

We used to have a topic covering ripping models from Overwatch over on Facepunch.

Now that Facepunch is gone so is most of the information we used to have.
I was thinking of reviving the thread here.

Who still has links to the latest extraction tools and files that are needed
I remember there was a Toolchain-extraction but other then that I have no clue.

iirc there's a thread of the archived facepunch forum over at knockout.chat. i'm sure you can find information there. i'm not sure the xtractors managed to establish the subreddit they put up there. checking google and other subs the appveyor download site for the toolchain is dead tho.

Yeah that's why I thought it might be a smart thing to continue the work here.
Most of us where already on both forums which where involved, and maybe we can start on it again.
Or atleast see how we can reboot it

Thanks guys!
But with every update the "key" changes, and because of that I cant use the old code, plus I lack the personal coding knowledge like the others had to create something new from it
