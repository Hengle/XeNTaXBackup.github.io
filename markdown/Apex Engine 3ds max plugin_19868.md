(Just throwing this here in case you missed this title)
Did you try it with Generation Zero? It also runs on the Apex Engine. 

And by the way, awesome release. I'm downloading the games and I'll report any issues.
What do you suggest for extracting the various archives? For example, I cannot find anything for theHunter Primal.

Edit: in fact it's very hard to know what unpacks what. Can you point us to the right direction please?

Thanks!!

Not sure who's original author tho, I only modified primal version.

SARC archives from the hunter/primal can be extracted with Gibbed's Just Cause 2 tools.
I expected that Gibbed will release SARC extractor for JC4 and Generation Zero, however there is no such release, so I think I'll just release mine.

ARC archives from the hunter cotw, Generation Zero can be extracted with Gibbed's Just Cause 3 tools. You will need to download mine fork of Just Cause 3 repo, replace bin/project folder with mine and set correct project name in current.txt file, in order to extract correct file names.

You can build dev branch from ApexMax repo, it's fixed for some Generation Zero models to load. Some materials won't load.

Hi,

Thanks for the reply. Sorry I couldn't get back to you earlier.

With your bms script, theHunter and theHunter Primal works 100%.
I tested with several meshes and got everything to work fine, thank you.


@HunterCOTW, apparently you cannot import .MESHC, just .MODELC and these always result in 3ds Max crashing.

Is this how it's supposed to be? After extracting several ARCs I still have a hard time finding .MODELCs, MESHC is more common and their size makes more sense to be a 3D model... But I could be 100% wrong, I'm just guessing here! 
Also there are files with .HRMESHC extension, but I don't think they matter much for now. hehe

And... the texture converter doesn't work for me either using COTW hmddsc files. It always say "Invalid File" on the console. Any clues?

@Generation Zero, I don't have the things I need to build here, but I'm re-downloading the game anyway. We'll see.

meshc, modelc and hrmeshc must be together in order to load.
texture converter only accepts ddsc (or dds) files, again ddsc and hmddsc files mush be together in order to extract all data
modelc and meshc tends to be inside SARC archives.

I used the JustCause3.Unpack on all COTW .ARCs

I got a lot of files, but just 22 .modelc
In comparission, I got 170 .meshc
Having modelc + meshc in the same folder still crashes 3ds here

Similar thing happens to the textures..
Most of my hmddsc does not have a ddsc companions. 


Should I pm you instead of spamming here? lol

in addition most of a ddsc files are inside SARC too

Also you should open Maxscript listener (F11 key), plugin will print any error messages, unfortunetly I didn't secure anitcrash when loading incomplete modelc files. I expected, that most of people will know what files they'll need in order to successfully load stuff.
Apparently I was wrong. 

I wall say it one last time. modelc, meshc and hrmeshc files must be in the same location in order to load.

Fixed crash when loading incomplete stream files for modelc formats.
Fixed crash caused by leftover remap bones, that were not cleaned properly.

I'm returning to the same subject.. I don't think the .filelists are complete. 
Are you sure the file dumper is dumping everything we need?

For Generation Zero for example, the characters/robots are complete and everything works.

But if I go to folder -> models\weapons\
All the weapons do not have .meshc and the textures do not have .ddsc, making them impossible to open.

Another instance of this happening, for example, is on \models\manmade\buildings\civilian
All those folders only have .hrmeshc, no .meshc


I could go on with this, but I think you got my point by now..

Use this for extract [https://github.com/kk49/deca/releases](https://github.com/kk49/deca/releases) an you will find all .hrmeshc, and .meshc [](http://www.imagebam.com/image/323f461222274094)

I have all of them.
Are you sure, you're using this? [https://github.com/PredatorCZ/Gibbed.Ju ... Zero/files](https://github.com/PredatorCZ/Gibbed.JustCause3/tree/master/bin/projects/Generation%20Zero/files)
Are you sure, you have Generation Zero set in current.txt?
Do you have this game installed via steam? It works only for them. 
I could post .xml where you can set your own custom game path.
Are you sure, that you extracted ALL SARC files?

These files are incomplete. You will need meshc, modelc, ddsc files. All of these files are inside ee archive. Those archives cannot be extracted (the header is missing) and I don't know where these data are.

EDIT:
So now I know where these data are, it should be relatively easy to make an extractor.

I think I managed to make it work with current settings


Max plugin needs to be updated though, doesn't work (improper file format error) when trying to import mesh, 

Also I think .hrmeshc contains real geometry data that .meshc refers to

Also I think .hrmeshc contains real geometry data that .meshc refers to

modelc contains material data, and refers to meshc.
meshc contains low resolution meshes and refers to hrmeshc
hrmeshc is high resolution mesh, it contains buffers for highest quality meshes.
Multiple modelc files can refer into single meshc file.
hrmeshc files are stored only inside arc files, besause of their size, and because modelc/meshc are duplicated along of many small archives.
Funny thing, is that all collected small archives (~3200) have size ~26GB, after extracting them all, the size of extracted data is ~3GB. This engine seems like a giant bloatware tbh.

I tested with several meshes and got everything to work fine, thank you.

Hey, can you(or anyone here) help me do this? What do I need to extract Primal files, and how do I do it..? Is it possible to get custom content working in the game, as well(re-compressing or something)..?

Thank you!

Do you have anything that can process the engine's .streampatch files for terrain? You have some references in your ApexLibrary but I'm unsure how to use it.

```


I tried compiling the repo in Clion but it keeps failing.

Streampatches are on hold, since I had no experience with marching cubes. I might look at it sometime.

Emulators like cygwin are untested/unsupported, however ApexLib/Tools can be built under Ubuntu with GCC (see travis config).

I want to import models from TheHunter COTW but I get this error: "WARNING: [ADF] Uregistered class: AmfMeshHeader (0x6f841426)"

Btw, I extracted the modelc file with DECA. I wonder if I am doing something wrong or maybe the developers modified the format. I can upload the file if needed.
