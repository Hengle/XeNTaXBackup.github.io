- Post Title: Disney Sing It .tex files

Hi there, first time poster, lurked for a few years.

5 years ago I worked on a project for the Disney SIng It games to allow custom songs and charts. It went smoothly up until I lost the programs that allowed the converting of the videos, images and charts.

So I'm currently trying to trace back my steps for a few things and one of the first things was regarding the .tex files in the game. I was able to convert the other files, but for some reason these .tex files specifically cause the game to crash. I've tried different programs and some conversions offered on the forums here and it never works. I was able to get one program to recognize it and convert them to .jpg/.png, but when I converted them back, they caused the game to show as a missing texture and then crashed. So since I'm at a lost now at this point I thought I'd post here to see if maybe someone can offer help here.

On the song selection, the thumbnail is highlighted followed by a video preview of the song. I thought it was the video that caused the crash, but I tried copying these files and renaming them for a new song and the issue was still there. I'm not entirely sure how I did it 5 years ago.

These are standard DDS files with TEX extension.
You can view then in IrfanView and edit them in GIMP.
