Can anyone help please? I have used just about every Capcom .tex tool I could find and no luck with any. Any help will be greatly appreciated.

DXT5. And needs texture ordering. Is it Switch(ed)? I have no idea which order this brick uses.

Google attempt lead me [there](https://www.vg-resource.com/thread-31389.html). I recoded [this](https://github.com/gdkchan/BnTxx/blob/master/BnTxx/BlockLinearSwizzle.cs) "thing", but it seems to not want to work. It does a nice pattern, but it's a nope. It seems seriously wrong for plain block re-ordering anyway. i tried morton too. Didn't wanna do it either. So... i gotta call quits.
