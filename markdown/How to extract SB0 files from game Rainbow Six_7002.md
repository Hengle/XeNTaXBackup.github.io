- Post Title: How to extract SB0 files from game Rainbow Six

Hi there, 

I want to get the sounds from the PC-game Rainbow Six Vegas 1+2

The file format is SB0 

What is the best way to convert or extract them into WAV?


Thank you in advance

- Post Title: How to extract SB0 files from game Rainbow Six

Hello
I have the same problem here, so I'm replying on this old thread instead of creating a new one.

Here : [http://pc.joshw.info/t/](http://pc.joshw.info/t/) (search for Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Vegas 2)
I found an archive containing music from the game, files format is .ogg. 

During my research for a tool to extract .SB4, .SS4, .SP4 (despite the fact everyone referring to this is mentionning .SB0 files I can't find any in my game folders, I assumed mine are called .SB4 but are the same files ?) I came across a few posts that mentionned the .SB0 would be a kind of compression of .ogg Vorbis so it matches.

I'm wondering if the person who uploaded these files has a way of extracting those .SB0/.SB4 .SS4 .SP4 files to ogg... I assume he has one because I don't see how it could be possible to get them otherwise.

But I don't know who uploaded this, I can't find any credit or anything, it's all under this "pc.josh.info" index...

Any help would be much appreciated.
Thanks in advance
Broula
