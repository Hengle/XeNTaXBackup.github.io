If you own the game and a modded xbox 360 you could plug it into computer and do a rip. If not but you own the game can download a backup and work with it.

Hi everyone,

my name is Phil, i´m new here and i will use this Thread to explain what i´m looking for.I´ve got some extra packs from FM4 in a ZIP file.Once it´s unzipped on my desk .how should i do, to be abble to open it to get some .carbin etc to open it with FORZA STUDIO ?

This is the file i ve got once unzipped:



The point of this is to have the possibility to have some .OBJ to work on it with 3DS MAX , to make nice renders.

In advance thanks
