So, is there any way to decode to WAV, or in case someone wants to listen to them at their original codec, at least add a header(be it GENH(ps2) or RIFF(pc)) to these files?

I used MFAudio to listen to the PS2 ones, it's just encoded with Sony's ADPCM (VAG). If a header is added, should be able to use existing tools to convert to wav, not sure about PC sounds, I never looked.

Cheers.
