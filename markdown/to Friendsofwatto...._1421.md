Hi mate,

Assuming that you are the person emailing me right now, then I have just sent a reply email to you. Otherwise, send me an email with your PayPal email address in it and I will send you the download link again.

In regards to the file you want me to look at - I have downloaded it and will look at it soon. Could you tell me what game the file is from please?

Thank mate.

Sure 

Grab my File Cutter from [http://www.watto.org/extract/download/cutter.zip](http://www.watto.org/extract/download/cutter.zip) and run the program. Use the program on the 300MB archive and it will copy some pieces from it and zip it up. Then all you have to so is attach the zip here, or email it to me.

Good luck.
