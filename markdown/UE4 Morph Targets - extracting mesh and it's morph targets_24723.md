- Post Title: UE4 Morph Targets - extracting mesh and it's morph targets

UE Editor doesn't have the export feature of morphs and all facial animations are done with morphs. Does anyone have suggestions for extracting UE4 models with their morphs?

Thanks,
Joe

Depends on the game. Most times you'll find a custom build on gildor's forums, some games like house of ashes do use them but a particular version, which doesn't work with that build either.

It's for Succubus, but I was hoping to find a version of UE Viewer that has the export option. Gildor made it so I can see them, just can't export them at this time with the UE Viewer

Custom umodel build with ability to export morphs exists since 2020 thanks to oscateexor. You can also find more recent build with those changes [here](https://www.gildor.org/smf/index.php/topic,7112.msg39276.html#msg39276).
