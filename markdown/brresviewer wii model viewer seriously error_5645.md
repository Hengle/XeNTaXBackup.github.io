it is not a bug , the second "duplicated mesh is an inverted mesh used to fake toon shading (the black outlines all over the model) enableing backface culling and applying the good textures to the mesh will show the correct mesh .

there is no error here.

I see, any idea how to remove black face culling vertexs and groups? not manual edition?.
bad for me the groups of black face culling area are the same of the normal model polygons.
