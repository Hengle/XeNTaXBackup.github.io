I'm a little late to copy it, use the latest version of the nox emulator, once installed go to program files (x86) and enter nox bignox and copy the directx11 dll that is in the free version of ninja ripper 2.0.5 then download ninja ripper from the official page is you will have a file.bin changes to .exe if I remember correctly it will allow you to install what you are interested in is the importer of version 2.0.10 for blender and noesis is free the addon, then with this run ninja ripper 2.0.5 as administrator and select the nox shortcut, it will start you, install the game, configure the ripp buttons in settings, I have f10 force rip, it should be noted that the models do not have bones and the model will be in the captured pose plus a few more frames open models without uvs others with uvs in blender you will need to edit uvs the good uvs are in world the uv number 3 and in local it will be number 2
