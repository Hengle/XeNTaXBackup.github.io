- Post Title: Struggling to rip things from Pandemic Express.

Hello! Sorry if this is the incorrect board for this; I just need a little help with ripping the 3D models from Pandemic Express. I've tried Ninja Ripper, but I think its making the game crash due to a DLL Ninja Ripper adds to the game folder. I know the game is made in CryEngine, but I can't seem to find any general CryEngine rippers like for Crysis, State of Decay, and the like. I've seen some more technical rippers, but I can't seem to use them since they involve the command line or powershell.

Can anyone help me? I know its possible because someone ripped a single model from the game and put it in Source Film Maker
