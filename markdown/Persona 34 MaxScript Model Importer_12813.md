- Post Title: Persona 3/4 MaxScript Model Importer

After a few months of work, it's finally done! (Well, mostly).



Supported:
- Animated and static objects
- Bones
- Rigging
- Materials
- Auto texture assignment
- Auto texture exporting
- Partial level support (works for most files, collision seems to be misplaced)

Not supported:
- Proper level importing

To import a model, import any PAC/RMD/F01/FPC file using the script.
If you put the textures in the same folder with proper names in tga or png format, the script will assign them.
To rip the textures, use RMDEditor to copy the texture preview and paste them into a png/tga or export the rmd through PersonaViewer/RMDViewer and use the tga's exported from that.

EDIT:
Here's some filelists made by a few friends of mine to make it easier for you to find models

EDIT 2:
I added auto texture export & import to the script. Simply keep RMDTexTool.exe in the same folder as the script and it'll work.

Nice work.

In fact Persona game has lots of similar models. Sorting the mesh is also a big job..

Ah this is awesome.

Though, I seem to be having trouble finding the environments/static meshes for the environments.

Any idea where those might be hiding at all?

They're in data.cvm\FIELD\PACK for both games.

I added some comprehensible file lists to the first post, to make it easier to find the models you want.
