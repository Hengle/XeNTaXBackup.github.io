Hi,guys! Resident Evil 3: Raccoon City Demo is available.I tried to use the RE7 Complete Tools and it successfully loaded 12129 files.
Someone script or tool to re_chunk_000.pak file?And is there any way to get the filenames?
By a new "Re3Hook" or any other tool? @Ekey

steam page:[https://store.steampowered.com/app/1173 ... City_Demo/](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1173690/Resident_Evil_3_Raccoon_City_Demo/)

Updated:Here @Ekey released his new Re3Hook and it supports win10.Thanks a lot!
