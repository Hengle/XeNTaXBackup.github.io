Anyone know any programs that will allow me to compress some of my textures (.jpeg or .png) to a desired size without losing TOO much quality overall?

That would be grand!

softwares like JPG Cleaner allow to remove the unneeded data inside the jpeg files but it's only the matter of some bytes:

for saving space you must avoid the progressive jpegs.

for PNG files the difference is made by the deflate compression used and as far as I know pngout is the free one that gives better performances:

in this case the saved bytes can be many.

thanks again - this helped me loads!

I'm just wandering is there a better way of editing textures than : converting .dds to .png - editing them - saving as .png - converting back to .dds?

when i edit the texture - the .dds files in PhotoShop with the nVidia's plug in the final texture is almost always 4 times larger than the original!

You can try using various image compression tools to reduce the size of your texture files without compromising too much on quality. Here are commonly used called [jpeg compressor](https://jpegcompressor.com/) it supports JPEG, JPG, PNG, SVG, WEBP, GIF, and Heic.
