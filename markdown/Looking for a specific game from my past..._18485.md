- Post Title: Looking for a specific game from my past...

Hey I can't remember this game clearly but maybe you can help. Long time ago I played this really in-depth hack-n-slash RPG, had a fuckton of quests and shit, kinda like Baldur's Gate or Diablo, but not those, the only one I vividly remember is this one quest where you had to go to a farm to investigate disappearances and eventually ended up in some caves, where you find this bug queen thing as the quest boss, and the gruesome thing about it was you could still see the skeletal remains of the two family members from the farm in it's semi see- through abdomen. I can't recall what game this was, but it's one I've been trying to re-acquire for a while, except I can't remember the name or much about it...

does resurrecting old threads get you murdered on xentax?
i have never seen a video game like you described
but it really reminds me of this:

which, should probably really be a video game one day
