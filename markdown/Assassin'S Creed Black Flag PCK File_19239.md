As posted in Zenhax, use WWise unpacker, rename to *.wem and they should play/convert in vgmstream or foobar.

@ Anexenaumoon: Just to make sure I understand. So you can IMPORT them back into the .pck file by this method as well?

As far as I know, you can only unpack the files, not reimport them into the pck file.

You wouldn’t be able to reimport because different values would change (ie. Headers and file sizes), and I don’t know if the game engine would allocate those changes.

What do you mean? How do I do that? Can you send me to Zenhax link?

Thanks in advance.
