Hello, and I am sorry for offtopic and spam, but this is my first time looking for a Spongebob's Truth or Square model.
Here's a .ho file of what map it would be.

Also please don't ban me as I have apologized to you all mods and admins of this forum!

Thanks. These are the Kitchen and the living room stuff. You're the cool model researcher I have ever seen in my life!
Edit: So, any example of the upgraded/non-upgraded decorations?
