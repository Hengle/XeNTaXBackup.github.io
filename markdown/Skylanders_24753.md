- Post Title: Skylanders

Just like the title says. I'm REALLY trying to get into the model files for Skylanders (Multiple games - Wii U) (Example file is SuperChargers) and I FINALLY got the main archive open and got to the interior files but now they are in .igz format and i'm stuck yet again. I really need the Rig and the textures to be exported as well so that one tool on the internet won't do me much good. If anyone knows ANYTHING please let me know!! Below is a example file of what I THINK could be the model file that i'm going for:
