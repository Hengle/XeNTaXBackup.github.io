- Post Title: Decrypting FSB file

Hey,
I'm trying to extract some audio files from an FSB file, But it seems its encrypted with a password.

How can I find the password for the files encryption? I saw some people somehow getting passwords for FSB files, so I wonder how to.

Really need these files decrypted :p

Thanks!
