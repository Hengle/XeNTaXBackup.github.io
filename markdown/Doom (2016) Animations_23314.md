- Post Title: Doom (2016) Animations

Hey.

I'm trying to export animations from Doom (2016) thanks to this: [https://youtu.be/no_ptkSwYVE](https://youtu.be/no_ptkSwYVE)

But I'm getting problems with every animations on the legs: [https://youtu.be/lt3rJEA8tbE](https://youtu.be/lt3rJEA8tbE)

I've noticed now that I'm using "Wraith Revenant 1.2" downloaded one from modme.co. And checking that [https://tools.modme.co/#changelog-view](https://tools.modme.co/#changelog-view) looks like there is even an 1.4 "Fixed more animation errors"...

Updater is not working, anyone here have it? I'm trying to contact with DtzxPorter but looks impossible. Thanks for your time.

Testing on Blender with SETools.

Doom Eternal tool works perfectly:

These are not "problems". Legs in Doom were animated using IK. So their movement is just not present in animations. Instead, they have feet IK position/rotation/pole keys. You will have to setup IK for that - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPlq7Cjgmk8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPlq7Cjgmk8)
