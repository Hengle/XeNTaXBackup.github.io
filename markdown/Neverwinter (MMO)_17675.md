- Post Title: Neverwinter (MMO)

Hello, I've been attempting to the .mset files from Neverwinter to a readable 3d format without much success.  I used a tool created by one of the members here to extract the data from the original .hogg file so I figured I'd come here to ask for help.

It's the same file format as in Star Trek Online if that helps.  Has anyone been able to convert the .mset files before?  I can upload a sample .mset file if anyone wants one.

you'll need Visual Studio (express) to compile this C# project.
(I'd suggest VS 2017; can't try it atm.)

I'm downloading the game right now! I hope the mount models can be extracted, because they look great!
