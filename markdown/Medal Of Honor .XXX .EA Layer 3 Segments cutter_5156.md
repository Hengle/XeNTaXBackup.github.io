- Post Title: Medal Of Honor .XXX .EA Layer 3 Segments cutter

This is an XXX package but it is not the usual XXX package, it just has ea layer 3 segments inside. Can someone write a bms script that extracts these segments?

the audio packages aren't compatible with package extractor, and are a very different format from the standard ut3 packages.
