- Post Title: Unity Engine (MonoBehaviour Files) İmport/Export ?

Hi guys. Is there a tool where I can import and export MonoBehaviour files of Unity games as Text?
Because most Text files are in MonoBehaviour.

I know there is UnityEx but it is paid.
There is the UABEAvalonia tool, but it doesn't export most MonoBehaviour files as text with it.
Is there any other alternative method?
