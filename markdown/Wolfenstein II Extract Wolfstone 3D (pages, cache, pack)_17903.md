- Post Title: Wolfenstein II Extract Wolfstone 3D (pages, cache, pack)

Hello,

I just joined. Specifically i joined to request your help if possible, to extract Wolfstone 3D files form the following Wolfenstein II The New Colossus files. 

I am a complete noob when it comes to extracting anything form any game.

Please keep in mind that i'm not 100% sure if these files actually contain Wolfstone 3D files within them, that is only a guess of mine based on the fact that the arcade cabinet containing the Wolfstone 3D is located in a map (level) called "Eva's Hammer" which is the name of the Nazi submarine. 

These files are: submarine.pages, located in virtualtextures\maps\game\wolf\submarine, textures.cache located in base\maps\game\wolf\submarine\submarine and sound.pack located in base\sound\soundbanks\pc.

What tools would i need to extract these files?

This is Wolfstone 3D: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4PggbfWvG0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4PggbfWvG0)

Further information about Wolfstone 3D:

Music Sound and the main menu is handled by the game itself and not wl6 files, while all the sprites, maps textures and data are wl6 files.

I have no intention to share the files if i manage to extract them, that's probably illegal.

They should just put Wolfstone 3D on GOG, i'd buy it for-$2.99-$3.99.

EDIT: I was able to extract pack files thanks to aluigi and his QuickBMS extractor.

But now i'm stuck with pages and cache files.
