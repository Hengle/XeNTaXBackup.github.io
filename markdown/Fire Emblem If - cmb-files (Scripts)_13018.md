Hey Guys,

we're translating Fire Emblem If to english right now because we want to create a uncensored, translated version of this game before Nintendo releases it to USA/Europe.

Right now, we have to add some Indicators (PCM/PCF) for the difference between Male and Female Character (Sama = "Master" / "Lady").

I think we can do this by editing the script-files for each chapter.

I've uploaded some cmb-files.

Hopefully someone could help us with decrypting and reencrypting this files.

thank you very much
