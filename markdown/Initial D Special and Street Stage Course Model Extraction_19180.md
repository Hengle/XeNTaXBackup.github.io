- Post Title: Initial D Special and Street Stage Course Model Extraction

So I have a project in mind and I need to extract Course map model's, because I want to be able to use them in another game.

But here's the problem.
The model file's are in a wierd file format, in a .AFS and .TBL format. (In Special Stage)
The model's in Street Stage, texture's and stuff like that are in .bin file format.
Can someone tell me please, what are those file's and how to convert them somehow, so 3ds Max (3D Model Creator) can read them ?
