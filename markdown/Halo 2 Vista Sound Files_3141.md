- Post Title: Halo 2 Vista Sound Files

I managed to pull out a few sounds from the map files. There are 2 formats so far, the first is a Xbox ADPMC wav file, the second has me stumped. I belive its another version on a wav file, it has these characters in the header "auds". It is defently missing the header no matter what sound it is. This is the only sample of this format I was able to find.

maybe it's some kind of subtitles or lip synchronization data?

Link fixed. It's not because it's main menu music, there is no words in it.

I can't figure out what format it is either,  I would like to know how you got out the other files though.  I haven't run across any map file extractors for h2v, only a metadata thing.

Wow, looks nice.  Hope it goes well.  I've still got no clue as to what type of audio it is though.
