- Post Title: Generator Rex: Agent of Providence Wii .dat QuickBMS script help

I extracted the files for Generator Rex: Agent of Providence Wii, but all the models are in a .dat file which I can't find a way to decompress. If anyone has a way to extract the files, I'd greatly appreciate it. This is my first time posting here, so I apologize in advance if I'm breaking any forum etiquette.
