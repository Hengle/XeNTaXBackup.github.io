- Post Title: Forza Horizon 4 gamedbRC (.SLT)

Hi, there was previously some talk a few years back about opening the database for Forza 6 Apex, but not much progress seemed to be made. Now that Forza Horizon 4 is out and has some interesting cars in it, I thought it was worth trying again to see if there was any interest.

I've uploaded the file externally as it's too big to attach: [http://s000.tinyupload.com/index.php?fi ... 7852581897](http://s000.tinyupload.com/index.php?file_id=31965762087852581897)

What I know so far:
- It should be an SQLite 3 database (judging by previous games which had unlocked gamedbs)
- It is likely compressed
- It might be encrypted (possibly TransformIT by Arxan?)
- The game executes a lot of SQL in memory, so someone with the right know-how might be able to hijack that and/or read data from memory
- No existing tools work on it - quickbms, zipping tools, etc.

I'd very much appreciate any help in reading this file.

I've posted the decrypted gamedbRC.slt file from Forza Horizon 4 and others in [Forza Apex database - gamedb.slt](https://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?p=193192#p193192) thread as there were more replies.
