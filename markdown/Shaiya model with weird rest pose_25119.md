- Post Title: Shaiya model with weird rest pose

Hello everyone, hope all doing very well and stay safe.   
I had in my drive an old game called Shaiya and hopefully finale00 made a noesis script for the .3dc models, the script works in around the 90% of the models, some models doesn't load but I'm interesting in a horse that loads with the script, but it have a weird rest pose, I have been tried to make a skeleton in blender to make a new rest pose, but sincerely have been hard and  the result does not look good. 
Hope someone get interesting in this game and can update the script to it can loads the skeleton bones with the weights. I'm attaching the horse sample, other models that doesn't load and the script. The horse looks cool!  Thanks for read.
