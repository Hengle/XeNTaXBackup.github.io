- Post Title: Star Trek Online .HOGG Packing

So I followed this [viewtopic.php?f=21&p=35159](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=21&p=35159) to unpack the STO .HOGG files and when I made all of the edits to textures and such I couldn't figure out how to convert it back into .HOGG. Any help appreciated.
