- Post Title: TMNT (2007) PC game file extraction

I have been trying to extract the models from the game TMNT 2007... they are compressed in a befunge .BF file, the kind used by Ubisoft. I have tried Dragon Unpacker, which didn't even recognize the .BF file, I have tried Watto's Game Extractor, which extracted about 2000 nameless, useless files, and I have tried the rayman 4 bf extractor, which I can't figure out because it has no GUI, and apparently isn't drag-and-drop. Anybody got any ideas for me? 
Thanks!
