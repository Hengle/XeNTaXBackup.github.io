- Post Title: Metroid Dread - Need help with getting models

Hey there! I'm trying to extract models from the dumped data of metroid dread

[viewtopic.php?f=16&t=24573&start=90](https://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=24573&start=90)

I was following this thread and used the PKG tool to extract the pkg files, but whenever I load the bcmdl file into noesis with the dread fmt_mmdl python script it keeps failing - asking where the animation files are located but I cant find those anywhere, and gives me an error on  line 802 with 'copy' is not defined and program ceases running.
If I remove line 802 from the script and try loading the model again, it only loads part of the model like the gun arm or the head, rest of the model is missing eveh though the bones are present

Can anyone give me a tip on how this is meant to work, or even better, can anyone send me a copy of the models with their textures as this is giving me a headache?
