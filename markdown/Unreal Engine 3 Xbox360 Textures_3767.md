Does anyone know how to convert the decompressed files from the Textures.tfc (from UE 3 games) to a viewable format such as in Photoshop?

I think what is missing is an appropriate header, but I cannot recreate one.

Gildor's umodel tools will convert them to .tga, which can be viewed and edited with most graphics editing applications:
