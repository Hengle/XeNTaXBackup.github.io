- Post Title: what kind of 3d model is it? //xmesh?

Hej Guys, thx for THAT forum ...

I have tried to ask in a umodel forum and they gae me the advice to ask here, so ...

I am currently designing my 79Suburban in 3d ... very exact. 
I have found a lot of similar 3d modells - but no one of this suburban models is real enough for my ideas ... 
so I am working on my own 3d modell. look at the pictures i have attached ...

//by the way, i have found heaps of 3d files using the gta 5 mode scene, all of them come from one model ... i have compared it ^^

But my question has an other reason.

I have also found a 3d model of my suburban at [https://www.simulatorgamemods.com/spint ... v10-14-18/](https://www.simulatorgamemods.com/spintires-mudrunner-chevy-suburban-1979-v10-14-18/)
(i have also tried to contact the model owner...)
I doNt know what kind of file it is ... //how can I import that into a 3d prg like 3ds max or blender?

there are a few folder //look also to the attachments



folder of mod file OrdnerStruktur.png (11.01 KiB) Viewed 53 times


with textures and xml files ... and only the _m folder has a few bigger files ... without a suffix ...
(i have opened such a file in an editor:
``<CombineXMesh>
<Material
MeshParts="EXTRAS_SUB3"
DiffuseMap="uidt5ci9.dds"
SpecularMap="uidt5c3c__s.dds"
NormalMap=""
/>
</CombineXMesh>``


maybe it is only possible to install that files using the mudrunner prg ... but my aim is
to import it into a 3d prg ...

i doNt intend to steal some things ... I only want to see how is it designed ...

thx in advance, steve
