- Post Title: Ring of Elysium ripping the snowmap: MT.Dione (pls help)

Hey all. I'm currently learning how to ripp files from games and I'm currently working on ripping files from a game called Ring of Elysium. To be exact the snowmap called "mt.dione". 

I looked around and there has been some discussions earlier about Ring of Elysium but not about ripping maps, usually only models like characters or clothes. I have tried NinjaRipper but to no avail... Is there any other tips or programs that someone can point to?

My plan is to extract the snowmap mt.dione for a fangame
