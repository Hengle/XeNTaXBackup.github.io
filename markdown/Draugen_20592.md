So, there's this new game called "Draugen" ([https://store.steampowered.com/search/? ... rm=draugen](https://store.steampowered.com/search/?snr=1_4_4__12&term=draugen)) released. 
It clearly uses UE4, but PAK file are encripted and requires AES encription key to open, so I can't check engine version. Are there any way to find this key? Thank you.

I think AES keys can be found with the shipping exe file from the game, so here it is: [https://mega.nz/#!4FgWmAZY!6_O_NL12Lo1n ... D3gtpnDwLA](https://mega.nz/#!4FgWmAZY!6_O_NL12Lo1n_ibCX0xsxapOoh_11t5OKD3gtpnDwLA)

I have the exe. Other people already checked it and found no key. Is there any other way to do so?

[https://blog.jamie.holdings/2019/03/23/ ... -projects/](https://blog.jamie.holdings/2019/03/23/reverse-engineering-aes-keys-from-unreal-engine-4-projects/) is telling you how to find encryption keys with GFlags, but I have no experience using this.
