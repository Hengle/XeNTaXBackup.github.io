Scanned thru the archive with Jaeder Naub. found and ripped graphics
 in form of Animated RIFF Icons and DDS textures, 
looked like smileys and stuff!

Hi mate,

I have attached a Game Extractor plugin for this game - here is how to use it...

1. Unzip the attachment to your computer (it will be *.class files)
2. Open the GameExtractor.jar file in a zip program like WinZip
3. Copy the *.class files into WinZip
4. Save the archive (as GameExtractor.jar, NOT GameExtractor.zip)
5. Restart Game Extractor.

Have fun, good luck.
