- Post Title: Need .VIV Plugin for Game extractor Program for godfatherps2

Help I need a plugin or update for the PS2 game "Godfather the game" this game uses .VIV archives to hold all the sounds and music i would like to extract anything in this archive i can use like the SFX and music like the godfather theme plus any movies or textures i can use, I will post a sample of the archive on a file hosting site, this archive is on the PS2 Version of the godfather game.

the archive sample is here (Link removed due to site dead)
I put it on this site: (Link removed) because its clean an allows for up to 5 gigs so i could in fact put the full archive on but it would take forever for me to upload and for ppl to download and analyze it but its here so if you can help me and/or send me a plugin file for my game extractor proggie that would help, I have a program called multiex commander and ive had no luck with that (no plugins compatible) id give you my email but not in here sorry but if the site has private messages we can do it that way, thanks for all your help
