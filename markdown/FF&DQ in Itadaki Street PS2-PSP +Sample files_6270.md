This format is almost identical to the Saint Seiya one. I wonder if that's why there was renewed interest Seiya.

Well, anyway, consider your request unintentionally granted in the next Noesis.

In the summons_files folder there are 6 summoned monster names with a .sfd file type association, does anybody know what's inside these files?

I figured since they are in the folder titled "MOV" that they might be movies, but I just wanted to see if anyone else knew.
