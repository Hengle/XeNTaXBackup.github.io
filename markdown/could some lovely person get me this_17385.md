there is tutorial on the site where you download it   
[http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/chrome_cache_view.html](http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/chrome_cache_view.html)

> Using ChromeCacheView
>
> 
>
> ChromeCacheView doesn't require any installation process or additional DLL files. Simply copy the executable file (ChromeCacheView.exe) to any folder you like, and run it. 
>
> After you run it, the main window displays the list of files currently stored in the cache of the default Google Chrome user. 
>
> You can select one or more cache files from the list, and then export the list into text/html/xml file ('Save Selected Items' option), copy the URL list to the clipboard (Ctrl+U), copy the entire table of cache files (Ctrl+C), and then paste it to Excel or to OpenOffice spreadsheet. You can also extract the actual files from the cache, and save them into another folder, You can do that by using the 'Copy Selected Cache Files To' option (F4).

to make it easier to find stuff in your cache list go to the webpage with the model you
want and clear your cache and refresh the page before opening ChromeCacheView.
