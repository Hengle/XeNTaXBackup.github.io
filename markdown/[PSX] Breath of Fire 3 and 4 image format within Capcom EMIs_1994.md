- Post Title: [PSX] Breath of Fire 3 and 4 image format within Capcom EMIs

Capcom as far as I can tell uses it's own image format other than the usual TIM that many PSX titles use. I provide examples from both titles just to be sure that it isn't changed from game to game. These should cantain sprites.
