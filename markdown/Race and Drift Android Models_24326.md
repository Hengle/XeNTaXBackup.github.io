shakotay2,

Could you test its texture file on the model?

I can't get it to work in my program.

yeah, my bad, uvs need to be scaled down (div 500 or so), y mirrored, then y scaled up by 3 (round about):

i wonder how did you get this part of the uv map correctly if you do the scaled down mapping and mirrored

just start with "div 500" (= multiply with 0.002):

Thank you for your tip, I have never seen UV datas like this before.

I used the div 512. 
The texture file is 1024 x 288, so I have calculated the correct value: 1024/288=3.55
