- Post Title: [PC] Silent Hill 2 Localization: Character Encoding

Hi guys,

Recently I'm trying to translate Silent HIll 2 into Simplified Chinese.

I'm using [Ultimate SH-MES Recompilator by Warmaker](http://hometown.sh/forum/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=7996) to extract the script files and it works like a charm. But the only problem was..the tool seems doesn't support any double-byte characters, like Japanese or Chinese.

When I'm trying to use this tool to decode any _j.mes (Japanese script files I've found from PS2 iso) or the Tranditional Chinese message file from Silent Hill 3, the decoded game script will be replaced by a lot of hexadecimal numbers (please see attached the sample text). 

Now I REALLY want to make this happen, please let me know if you have any idea, thank you!

BEST

Yes here's the link: [https://nightmarish-dream.ru/download/m ... ilator.zip](https://nightmarish-dream.ru/download/modding/ultimate_sh_mes_recompilator.zip)

Usage:

1. put any .mes file into src folder;

2. open UltiMES.exe, and click the top left button to decode;

3. find decoded .txt file in txt folder.



BTW please see attached the sample of Japanese .mes file (extracted from PS2 version, SLES-51156 - Director's Cut v1.02), thank you!
