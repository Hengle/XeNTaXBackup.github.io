- Post Title: How can I extract textures from Wolfenstein the Old Blood ?

I'm dying to get those new weapons in this game, and now I got the models, but couldn't get textures
I tried the tool in this post
[viewtopic.php?f=10&t=11542](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=11542)
But it didn't work, it seems that the tool won't work in windows 10, and Wraith Colossus only support the New Colossus
I appreciate for any help
