- Post Title: Is it possible to export this with the textures?

I don't use Noesis, but it opens a format that no other program opened. So I need to export this to open on MMD (the file needs to be .pmd/.pmx). I know that I can't do it directly, but if it is possible, how?

What format are you opening and what is MMD?

It's a program for 3d model dancing videos. And the format it accepts is .pmd/.pmx. I want to convert a .mview file (3d model downloaded from the internet) to one of this formats, but I have no idea how, since I didn't find anything on github.

I managem to convert it to .fbx, through Blender. But I still don't know how to convert to .pmx.

People use PMX Editor for this.  They don't use Noesis or Blender, unless your aim is to make things more difficult.

Hi, To convert file to PMX or PMD with blender you'll have to install a plugin called MMD tool master or ''Cats'' it's mainly a tool for Vrchat but it include tools for MMD too, But if you want to use the official way, you'll have to install a program Called Metasequoia4 And convert the file to a pmd or pmx format (this is the only official tool and it's quite expensive) Personally, i'll go with the cats plugin
