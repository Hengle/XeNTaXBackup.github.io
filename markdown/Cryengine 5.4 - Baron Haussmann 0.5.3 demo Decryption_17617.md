- Post Title: Cryengine 5.4 - Baron Haussmann 0.5.3 demo Decryption?

Hey guys, I'm trying to learn 'best practices' for Voxel based global illumination in Cryengine 5.4
There is a demo scene created by Simon Majar(now working for Wolcen: Lords of Mayhem) called Baron Haussmann demo focusing on architectural interior lighting, similar to the UE4 architecture design demos, except with no baked lightmaps but still retaining about 75-80fps on a GTX 1070. 
Cryengine tutorials and learning material for lighting with SVoTI is quite scarce. So i'm wondering if its possible to get a decryption key for the BaronHaussmann.pak trying to get a hold of some level data, lighting settings, materials/textures, etc.

The Baron Haussmann 0.5.3 demo files can be downloaded on the official forums here
[Baron Haussmann 0.5.3 demo](https://forum.cryengine.com/viewtopic.php?t=942) - might still be running on cryengine 3
