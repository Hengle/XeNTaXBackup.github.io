- Post Title: Kingdom Hearts 2 W_EX010.mset missing.

Hi!
I tried to get those Kingdom Hearts models & Animations.
I dumped Kingdom Hearts 2 Final mix and it worked but unfortunate some mset datas are missing for some reason!
Like "W_EX010.mset" which is the Animation data for the Kingdom Key(pretty muchy every mset data for Keyblades are missing)
Is there any way to get them?
