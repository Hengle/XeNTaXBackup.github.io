- Post Title: Extract sprites from God of Olympus Apk

Hello, I have been trying to extract sprites from Gods of Olympus app but I have no lack.
Opening the apk I was able to find what I think they are png files (Gods of Olympus_com.aegisinteractive.goo\assets\Packed\Dat\Ship) but it looks like they are encrypted, any ideas of what type of cryptography they used? Or how to find it out?

Here there are some files
