- Post Title: Starsky & Hutch - BTW archives

Ok so, I'm trying to open some .btW files from the PC version of Starsky & Hutch, To get some car models and their textures, Though I don't know how. Could anyone try to help?

Sorry to bump an old thread, but has anyone tried to reverse engineer Starsky & Hutch .btw archives?

If someone should come across, it would be great to reverse engineer here.

the format for the geometry looks to be pretty straight forward, I'm not even sure if this file you uploaded even has textures, I first though it could have some dxt texture but nah, maybe if its swizzled, but I don't think so.

Is there a tool to unpack S&H .btW files with known filenames?

Sorry for updating an old thread but I've documented the file format for this game. 

```
{
  Header header;
  Offsets offsets;  
  
  byte Data[x];  
  
  FileNameInfo fileNameInfos[offsets.FileNameCount];
  FileDataInfo fileDataInfos[offsets.FileDataInfoCount];  
  PackedName packedNames[offsets.PackedNameCount];  
  char extensionNames[offsets.ExtensionNameCount][4]; // null padded to 4 chars
  PackedName packedNumberedNames[offsets.PackedNumberedNameCount];
  char stringTable[offsets.StringTableSize];
}

struct Header
{
  int Unknown00;
  int Unknown04;
  char Magic[4]; // "WAD!"
  int Version;
  byte Unknown10[8];
  char Description[128];
}

struct Offsets
{
  int DataOffset;
  int DataSize;
  int FileNameCount;
  int FileNameOffset;
  int FileNamePtr;
  int FileDataInfoCount;
  int FileDataInfoOffset;
  int PackedNameCount;
  int PackedNameOffset;
  ushort NameDelta;
  ushort FileDelta;
  int ExtensionNameOffset;
  int ExtensionNameCount;
  int PackedNumberedNameOffset;
  int PackedNumberedNameCount;
  int StringTableOffset;
  int StringTableSize;
}

struct FileNameInfo
{
  ushort DirNameCount;
  ushort DirNameOffset;
  ushort FileNameCount;
  ushort FileNameOffset;
}

struct FileDataInfo
{
  int Size;
  int Offset;
}

struct PackedName
{
  // 0x7F        = no extension i.e. folder
  // 0x7E        = invalid extension
  // 0x79 - 0x7D = ordinal string of (0x7E - n) length
  // 0x77 - 0x78 = ordinal string with separator
  // else        = extension index
  int ExtIndex : 7
  int NameLength : 8
  int NameIndex : 17
}

```


The structure itself is pretty straight forward however unpacking filepaths requires some specific logic.

String information is packed in a structure I called "PackedName". For most files this is simply, "read StringTable from NameIndex, for NameLength characters, and append ExtensionName at ExtIndex", however ExtIndex values of â‰¥ 0x77 are special codes requiring custom logic. These codes are mainly used for files that contain ordinals and therefore share common base names e.g. Test_#.png => Test_01.png, Test_02.png etc. Instead of storing each filename, a template "base" string ("Test_#.png") is stored in PackedNumberedNames and only the ordinal ("01", "02", ...) part is stored in the name - providing deduplication at both levels, with the "base" string being referenced by NameIndex and stitched together. You can see my implementation for this [here](https://gist.github.com/barncastle/1bd317ed7ac30ae01528485c0d2291e2#file-starskyhutchbtw-cs-L107).

Additionally, each packed string only represents a fragment of a file path, usually either a file or folder name. Recursive logic using the FileNameInfo structs is used to combine all of the path parts together correctly. There are a few quirks with this but hopefully my [implementation ](https://gist.github.com/barncastle/1bd317ed7ac30ae01528485c0d2291e2#file-starskyhutchbtw-cs-L63) is clear enough to demonstrate this.

My full C# implementation and a tool is available [here](https://gist.github.com/barncastle/1bd317ed7ac30ae01528485c0d2291e2). Place the extractor in the game's directory, run and it'll extract all the assets to a new folder called "Dump".
