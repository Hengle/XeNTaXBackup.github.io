- Post Title: XeNTaX Forum looking for new owner

XeNTaX Forum is looking for a new owner! Interested?

As a follow up to the recent poll ( [viewtopic.php?t=26759](https://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?t=26759) ), we believe the best way to guarantee site continuation is to sell it to a third party that has the ability to build it further and improve upon it. 

It is clear the majority of the community wants the site to continue, and many offer to help out. 
To make that future a possibility, a new owner is needed that can dedicate time and expertise to maintain it, with support of those that wished to help.
Therefore, forum.xentax.com (plus wiki.xentax.com) is for sale, and once sold, the xentax.com domain will be handed over as well. The other content will be transferred to xentax.org. 

If you are interested in buying the Forum, or for questions, send an email to mr.mouse @ xentax.com with "Selling the forum" in the subject header.
