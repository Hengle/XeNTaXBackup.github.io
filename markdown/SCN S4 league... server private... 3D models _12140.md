- Post Title: SCN S4 league... server private... 3D models ?

hello, 
I am writing today, having crossed many unanswered forum I hurried to come to Xentax. I did not want to annoy you with my problems but I need an answer. 
A friend of mine runs a private server. 
And for us the SNA Formats are a mystery. We need help to find how to extract 3D models ... or just add SNA. knowing that the SCN (to add weapons from s4 league now ...) Someone would he know how to have scn compatible with the old client? Whatever we are given to create private servers ... 
If anyone knows how to also have models of weapons from the original game .. or to create his weapons / map ... and everything connected with it .. if anyone has information on everything private server management ... 3D Models ... or anything other related to what kind of stuff ... I'll be grateful to you for life ... thank you in advance
