- Post Title: musketers 3 (pc) .gdp

This is an old game made on iceengine. I've been trying to rip textures but most of them seems are without alpha channel. So I wonder maybe some of the PROs can handle with the archives.

p.s.: I actually found an extractor for .gdp files from exMachina but its archives are older than those from subject.

Attached a couple here:
