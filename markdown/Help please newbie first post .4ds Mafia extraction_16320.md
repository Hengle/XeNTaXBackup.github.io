- Post Title: Help please newbie first post .4ds Mafia extraction?

Hi,
     Great site Thanks for having me.
I am here searching for a way to extract/convert the .4ds car files to either .3ds (non max) .dae or fbx etc etc.

I have a few programs already, ie Zmodeler,FBX converter and Blender but none of them can do it? PLEASE could someone point me to a link or tool that will open and convert .4ds files? or even do it with me?

Here are some examples of cars i have already converted found on the net (none of which started in .4ds format etc) I hope to be able to get at the 1930s style cars found in Mafia mods etc
