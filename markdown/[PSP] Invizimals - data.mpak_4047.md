```

idstring FPAK
get MPAK_SIZE long
get DUMMY long
get FILES long
for i = 0 < FILES
    getdstring NAME 0x20
    get DUMMY long
    get OFFSET long
    get SIZE long
    get DUMMY long

    savepos TMP # add an extension... maybe useful
    goto OFFSET
    getdstring SIGN 4
    goto TMP
    if SIGN == "RIFF"
        string NAME += ".wav"
    elif SIGN == "FPAK"
        string NAME += ".mpak"
    elif SIGN == "ptex"
        string NAME += ".ptex"
    elif SIGN == "â€°PNG"
        string NAME += ".png"
    endif

    log NAME OFFSET SIZE
next i
```
I have added also the auto-assigning of an extension to the files, maybe it's useful (after all it costed me nothing to add it ih ih ih)
