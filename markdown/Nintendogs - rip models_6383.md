First note: you should post a sample file to let us studying the format.
Second note: nsbmd (BMD0) is the most common NDS format so if you serch on the forum and on the web I'm sure you will find what you need. es: NSBMD Tool
Third note: not all nsbmd from different NDS games are the same. So I adivise you to post some samples.

The file you see is the .nds rom and it's like an iso for pc. You need a nds viewer to see how the files are set.
Then you have some of ways to proceed. You can use an hex editor to extract narc(conteiner of nsbmds) and nsbmd(mdl0) files.
Or some tools already present on the web (use google) to view and extract directly the files of 3d models es: Tihaxa by Arcnor.
and finally nsbmd tool.

the backgrounds and 3d items can be viewed well.

And this is one of the dogs...mmmmm probably after the passage of an Industrial truck...lool   
( i'll try with another version of the tool)

Solved the mistery .....You need to use the old version of nsbmd tool to view correctly all 3d models of this game.
It's really simple fo find it on the web. Then you can use a3d ripper like 3dvia or ogle3d to ripp the models from the viewer.

Next time if you want help you need to upload some samples (in this case nsbmd files) not the rom ,or eventually ask to us
how to obtain some sample from the rom or iso.

Actually you can only rip the models from the nsbmd viewer in T-pose using 3dvia printscreen or Ogle3d. 
( in dae format for 3dvia or obj for ogle3d). I advise you 3dvia printscreen, it's more simple and stable.
The main problem is that you have to fix the uv maps manually, because they are oversized in relation of the texures.

This is the model at the start....see the textures:

This is how it appeares the model after you fixed it:

Can you upload the ripped model of the dog you ripped? Can you extract other dogs from the game? Also where can i get OGLE 3D? and how can i convert 3dxml to .obj or .3ds? and where can i find the old version of nsbmd viewer?

Unfortunately u can't compare the quality of the same game for gc and nds. The models have not the same quality u can see it
even searching for them on google, GC models are far better then nds ones. Anyway i tried with all viewers for nsbmd format that i have , and all gave me errors viewing them.

Sorry to necro this thread but considering my last post about GERA got ignored maybe I'll get an response here. Where did you get these pictures from? Did you rip these models yourself? Cause if you did, would it be possible for you to share them or tell us how you got them?
