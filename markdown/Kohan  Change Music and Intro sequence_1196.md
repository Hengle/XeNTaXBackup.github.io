> 1. Download MultiEx Commander from Xentax.  This will allow you to extract files from the Kohan_AG.tgw file.

> 2. Extract the data/multimedia.ini file and place it in a new sub-folder in your KAG directory (wherever you installed it)  - you may have to create a new folder yourself if it isn't already there (name it DATA).

>     Movie_02 = TimeGate_Logo.bik

> 4.  If you can't get MultiEx to work, you can download this modified multimedia.ini file.  Extract this zip file into your KAG directory - it includes the Data folder.

> AG_Ingame1.wav

> AG_Ingame2.wav

> AG_Ingame3.wav
>
> AG_Ingame4.wav
>
> AG_Ingame5.wav
>
> AG_LOSEBRIEFING.wav
>
> AG_Menu.wav

> That should do it. Note, I also used a .wav editor to double the volume on all of them, as they seem to be quieter than normal. Or I'm going deaf. *Shrugs* - Durandal
