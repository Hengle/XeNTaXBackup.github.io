- Post Title: Muppet RaceMania SFX

I guess someone ripped the VB and VH files for Frogger, but why not Muppet RaceMania?
I need help on dissecting Muppet RaceMania's SFX.

I tried using PSound but it only gave me two sounds.
I also tried using VGMTrans but the sounds were cut-off.

Here's the ZIP file:

it looks like the problem is that you've ripped them as raw data, so it's also included the disc sector headers.

You need to rip them as normal files.  If you're using something like jPSXDec, just untick the "Save raw" box.

I just exported them as normal files, used VGMTrans again and it worked! Thank you so much!!!
I'm sending the sounds to The Sounds Resource soon!
