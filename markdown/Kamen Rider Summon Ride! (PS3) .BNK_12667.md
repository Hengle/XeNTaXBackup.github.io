- Post Title: Kamen Rider Summon Ride! (PS3) *.BNK

Hello i was looking at the Files from the recently dumped update data for Kamen Rider Summonride and most of the File are the same as Kamen Rider Battiride War 1 & 2 for PS3 but the method i use to get the SE Files out of the BNK's dose not work? 

I have tried using PSound and "ADPCM Player v1.44h" It might be using a PS3 ADPCM format ensted of a ps2 like the others. 


VGMStream says it can handle it but it gives it 2 channels and breaks the dump.wav
