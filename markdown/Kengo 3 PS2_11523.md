I am struggling with this game's file format. I would like to upload a sample of it but it is 1 giant file.
Is there a way to show off the hex?

I figured out the structure of the Large binary/Container file 

```
{
   uint32_t offset;
   uint32_t size;
};

//Once you have the real data
struct KengoFile
{
   uint32_t unkn1;
   uint32_t nFiles;
   uint32_t unkn2;
   uint32_t unkn3;
   FileEntry* files; //nFiles];
};

```


But with all files being nameless identifying all 7,000 files is gonna be a fun (Making coffee)

Continuing with my fools chase 
I have managed to  locate a few "TIM2" files i would like to convert these to Bmp or any other format

Also I found a few object files, animation files and what i believe to be text files.

I would love to translate this game to English.


But First things first I will tackle the animation files.

```
{
    //Line 1
    int unkn1;
    int unkn2; //1
    int unkn3[2]; //0

    unsigned int ptr; // 2 last to lines of file
    int unkn4[3]; // 0
        
    int boneCount; // 19
    int unkn5; //624
    int unkn6[2]; // 0
};

struct BoneName
{
    char name[32]; //This seems excessive but it feels like the names are always padded
}; 

boneNames[header.boneCount];

```


I am having a hard time understanding this format. Its a very random compilation of integers floats and pointers

Seems like the model files have the same header as the animation files

After researching the obj file format (ant this forum) i realise this might actually be an obj file so i created and rendered a mesh in unity (see attachment: Looks nothing like anything from the game. Probably a lod file?)

from lines 112 - 400
Vx, Vy, Vz, 1
1f, 0, 0, 0 //is this uv?
1, 0, 0, 0 //This could not possible be the normal cos 1 here is an int (why switch)

line 400 as pointed to seems to be triangles
from from the vertex index

The presence of these many integers in a model file is confusing. Other than faces i see no other uses

(I used little endian (litE) for file 000019576832 although I thought PS2 files were using big endian?)

(Not to confuse: the vertex "floats x, y, z" are in a special format named IEEE-754
and are converted to floats -5.959999 -0.000001 5.099999 by hex2obj.)

Thank you very much. Going by this logic it seems the first file i gave you isnt an animation file but rather a model file

Face Count
F50 : 112
UV
F70
The vertex count is
2B0 : 58

same "36"


These were the values I got. The image was nonsense. Maybe i made a mistake

I wrote the last post while fighting sleep it might be 100% inaccurate. Apologies.

I made an assumption that  [this was an animation file](https://mega.co.nz/#!BlMB1IYQ!DrRqeQNEJ0ghnhZauM70c9-KZVmL_Ac3Bp7rNNQkRJs).

The format is eerily similar to the 3d objects but halfway it become inconsistent. It is the biggest of all the files hence the most difficult. 

Any assistance would be cherished

well, an animation file without the suiting model file does not make much sense.

Then do you know the english translation of
KATA, SAKO, UDE, TE, MUNE, HIZA, MOMO, ASI?
Could be the bones.

Here's a rough structure of the supposed animation file:



structures.JPG (86.54 KiB) Viewed 208 times



There might be positons/rotations contained but without knowing even the count of bones
it doesn't make sense to continue analysis imho.

Te - Hand
Mune - Chest
Hiza - Knee
Kata - Shoulder
Ude - Arm
Kao - Face
Asi - foot
Kosi - loweback/waist/hip
Momo - thigh
Sako - Collar bone/ Clavicle


There are 19 bones if you include BODY_ 

This was what led me to believe this was a skeleton of some sort.
It says it at x020 (0020h).

thx. Well, we have 163 of these 01000000... blocks and 292 of the 02000000.., in sum 455.
If it were 456 it would fit to 24*19.

From 0x6C70 it looks like mesh data (face indices starting from 6C60) but sadly it isn't.
Copy the following 6 lines into an empty text file and rename it to whatever.H2O.

0x6C60 453
Vb1
48 99
0x6C70 453
040000
0x0 255

Enter 36 as a face indices offset as before.

Load the animation file and the H2O file into hex2obj.
Press the "noPtC"-button to change to point cloud view and press the "mesh"-button.

No decent mesh, not much sense to continue.

Thanks a lot for your help so far. I just have one question about Face data needing to skip so many bytes (for example 36 in the previous examples).
 Is that not some what wasteful? or is other data naturally stored in between the indices.


Lastly just based on general experience do you know of any file formats that has a bunch of float mostly 1's (00 00 80 3F)

Thanks again

There is the possibility that the first bone (body) is the root object and has no animation keys as it is moved during the game by the ending (Very common standard of that era)

 Is that not some what wasteful? or is other data naturally stored in between the indices.As for the animation file: there are floats stored in this space. But it's not clear whether it's a mesh with face indices at file's end. That was just a suggestion.

> Lastly just based on general experience do you know of any file formats that has a bunch of float mostly 1's (00 00 80 3F)It's not uncommon. Just search any given model for them. You'll find lots of 1's being contained.

After reviewing the 360 release for this game i found out that the files i mistakened for animation files were not animations
The were called .ref and just seem to be skeleton files.

I found the animation files  .key (key for keyframe) and was able to decipher their structure

```
//I don't understand the need for the constant value after the key when key could have just been made an integer
//I don't understand why there are 2 floating values either
public struct KeyFrame
{
	public ushort key;
	public ushort const0; //548 = 24 02h
	public float f0;
	public float f1;
}

public struct Channel
{
	public ushort frameCount; //number of frames
	public ushort unkn0; //260,261,262.... for 6ers: first batch 256,257,258
	public List<KeyFrame> frame; // [frameCount]
}

public struct Node //Probably bones
{
	public ushort ID;
	public ushort channelCount; //0, 3, 6
	public uint addr;
	public List<Channel> channels;
}

public struct KeyFile
{
	public uint id;
	public float one;
	public float unkn0; //coincides with max frame count
	public float sixty;
	public uint nCount; //Node Count
	public List<Node> node;
}
#endregion

```


The problem now is trying to map the  node.ID to an actual bone from the .ref file

PS: 0x00000008h is the same as float 0. I see this hex sometimes when I expect a floating point value. Is it wrong to read this as a float?

OMG lol
So I managed to read all the relevant files and all.....
Most of t time the game actually imports and animates a rig runtime
not the actual bones

Now I have to figure out how to connect the rigs to the bones (FML)
