- Post Title: Tales of the Abyss - .bin files

[http://taletalesource.blog69.fc2.com/bl ... 60.html?sp](http://taletalesource.blog69.fc2.com/blog-entry-160.html?sp)
So a Japanese user made a tutorial about extracting files from Tales of the Abyss's .bin files and I tried it without reading the Japanese text and looking at the pictures instead, and I got it working (extracted from the BTL_MGC.BIN file).

Can someone make a bms script of this please?
