Just taking a peek at this. It seems there's a table at 9c40h. With filenames that are encoded, probably XOR encoded. 

In theory it might be possible to decode it. Needs some effort.

ToWav sounds like a generic sound extractor that does not have to "know" the true format of .wpk?

You'd miss other content if you use such a program.

it might be proper to ask here but anyone know anything about hackshield pro?? 

I was trying to rip some models because they look totally awesome. This game has one of the best looking models so far out there and i would like to get my hands on em.



The problem with ripping and hackshield is that it shut down the game before i hit the rip button so the only 2 alternatives are reverse or bypass
