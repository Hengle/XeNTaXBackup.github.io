- Post Title: Half-Life Alpha MDL Version 6

Well I want to decompile the .mdls from the leaked Half-Life Alpha, but they're in version 6, which any existing half-life model viewer can't read. Any info on this format?

That won't work, the format itself is quite different from the final HL MDL format. It is skeletal though. Looks like fixed-length sequence structures containing offsets to frame data, but I haven't had a chance to look at it for more than a few seconds in a hex editor at home. There's nothing in there that's particularly enticing, but a Noesis script to support it would be cool, since then the models could be directly converted to Quake 1/2/3 or something for modders to play around with.

Very very late reply, but for anybody stumbling upon this, here's a link to a model viewer and decompiler: [https://docs.google.com/file/d/0Bw73Q9G ... sp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/file/d/0Bw73Q9G4RF1YVklQN09hdU1KT2M/edit?usp=sharing)
From this thread:

And here's a model viewer (no decompiling) for the even earlier V4 models (olive.mdl, reddoc.mdl, etc.):
