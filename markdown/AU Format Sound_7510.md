- Post Title: AU Format Sound

Having a little trouble with this AU file. It can't be played in WMP. Audacity takes it but I can barely make out the sound. An AU format sound file should easily be read by most audio players. This one has no header, even though it should be SND.

Any help would be great

You should cut and upload the first 10MB of the archive.

Doesn't look like an AU file, looks like straight up Sony ADPCM.  Try FastElbja's ADPCM player: [http://www.freewebs.com/snakemeat/tools ... v1.44h.zip](http://www.freewebs.com/snakemeat/tools/ADPCM_Player_v1.44h.zip)
