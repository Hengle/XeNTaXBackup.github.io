Could someone create a simple script that could convert a png or jpg file to xtf which is the texture format used for the port of half-life 2 on xbox

If I'm reading this correctly [https://github.com/NeilJed/VTFLib/issues/9](https://github.com/NeilJed/VTFLib/issues/9)
supporting conversion for xtf is NOT something that "simple script" could handle
