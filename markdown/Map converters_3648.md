- Post Title: Map converters

Hi!

I know I asked this before but can't figure out witch thread. I want to import whole maps into max to play around with. Does anyone of you have any good map converters/viewers etc. I know gtkradiant have alot but strange program and don't get a good overview.

I have ripped some maps with 3d ripper but not good. I know tomb raider underground has a viewer etc but can't get the map.

Any suggestions are welcome
Thanks

As I remember Nem's Half life tools (map Viewer!?) can export all map and texture into 3ds/tga format!
