- Post Title: Zepeto 3D Model Extraction

Hi all! If some of you remember, Zepeto was(/kinda still is) a popular 3D app in which you could create a character based off of a picture of you, make it do little dances and photoshoots, etc. The models themselves are pretty high quality, but there is little-to-no support for ripping them from the game, except for a very painful NinjaRipper + Nox Emulator process that doesn't get joints or blendshapes. I've done it, and it just isn't worthwhile. 

I have a jailbroken iOS device, so I've been playing around with throwing various game files into AssetStudio (as Zepeto is a Unity app). So far, I've been able to extract several models this way, but exporting the character itself as well as most of the joint/blendshapes has proven to be very difficult. Would anyone be interested in the game files and seeing if anything can be figured out? This could potentially be a very useful ripping tool for the community, as it has massive customization possibilities and isn't just 'as is' like most rips.
