It contains the soundtrack, but I don't know how to extract them. BTW, it's HUGE (easily a few hundred MB, but it's not in front of me right now).

Can you check with a HEX editor if you can find instances of the following 2 byte sequence, roughly 520 bytes apart from eachother: FF FB

Or try to open it with a good text editor (Editplus2, Notepad+, etc) and see if you can tags like "LAME" or "XING".

If so, i might be able to help you out.


Cheers,


Nick Kusters.

If you got the file, use a file splitter and upload an example.
