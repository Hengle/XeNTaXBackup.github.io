Hey guys, I have some .cba files I want to get into. They are animations, is there any way somebody knows how to extract and replace the animations in this file? It is from NHL 15 on the 360. Thanks!

@clou14 did you ever figure out the CBA files?  NBA JAM On Fire Edition has the same CBA animation files and I've love to dig into them

Truth is animation requesters come and go with interests fading away within some days.
So nothing will happen.
