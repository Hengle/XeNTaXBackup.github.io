- Post Title: Atelier Firis model files & textures.

Hello~. I managed to extract the elixir.gz files from Atelier Firis' PAK files, however I cannot get anything past that to extract. I tried using howfie's tool to extract both the elixir.gz & g1t but to no success. I'd assume they changed the format quite a bit. I tried to swap headers, etc. But still didn't work. I'd assume the g1m file may be different as well. If anyone could possibly figure out the new format that'd be great!

Heres a few samples; I included the whole folder for PC01A and also included a few other examples of the "model.elixir.gz" and "g1t"

this modified "Kaizoku Musou 3" Noesis python script will open your *.g1t texture samples

which platform did your samples come from?
google says it was released on PlayStation 4, PlayStation Vita, Microsoft Windows

the gz files don't look compressed to me, its just their extension for the model files i guess

Thanks!

They're from the PC version of the game. 

I don't really know, I'm not that great at hex stuff xD. But all the scripts I've tried that I could find have not worked on the files so yeah.
