- Post Title: .OBJ Graphics? (Power Rangers: Super Legends for DS)

I've been trying to make some rom hacks for this game, adding in new characters/levels, and I've hit a bit of a roadblock. All of the sprites are in the .OBJ format, and I can't find anything that will convert them into/out of an editable format. On top of this, the stages are in some weird format I've never heard of, and judging by some google searches most others haven't heard of them either. The stages come in .bin, .mapdef, .tdf and .tgr file types.

I've attached the Omega Ranger's sprites (\data\sprites\characters\rangers), the level files I extracted from the test level folder (\data\maps\levels\test) as well as the Palettes.bin file that was in /data. Could anyone take a look at these and see what they can find? I'll of course update this post with anything new that's found, but it would be really great if I could get a little help!
