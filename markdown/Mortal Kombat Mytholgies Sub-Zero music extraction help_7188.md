Hi Guys

I already posted this in the Audio forum but got no replies so maybe I needed to post it here.
I am new to the forums, so if you need me to post screens or upload files please let me know:

I have recently tried to extract all the music from MKM:SZ on Playstation 1. I am usally very good with finding the right tool for the job, I will download anything and try it when im on a mission to rip music. But I don't know enough about hex and offsets so I am limited to use what is only available. After much messing about I believe MKM:SZ uses some sort of custom format as if you scan with an CDXA scanner .xa format it only returns the audio from the movies. I have tried a few various other tools like PSXPlay and a shitload of BMS scripts but im stuck and need you help to rip this awesome soundtrack, as no one has ripped it and it needs to be made available to the MK fans in CD qualuty The filetree on the disc has no XA folders at all. The music is hidden on the disc someware. If it was in a file I can scan the file, but so far I can only scan the .iso image or the original disc I have. Just to check I wasn't doing things wrong I ripped Lethal Enforcers XA folder and MK4 and both worked a treat but MKM:SZ is a mystery

breakdown of the filetree:

DOZER.BIN - 1KB
NOXCUSES.BIN - 29,297KB
SLES_010.20 - 810KB
SYSTEM.CNF - 1KB
WARNING.TIM - 321KB
CHARS - 2.13MB (.bin files)
CHARS2 - 2.61MB (.bin files)
LCDS - 1.93MB (.lcd files) (.wav files inside)
LCDS2 - 2.72MB (.lcd files) (.wav files inside)
LEVELS - 7.64MB (a folder for each level in the game containing .bin,.lvl,tsq,.txd and .wal files) 
LSDS - 353KB (.lsd files 1x .wmd file)
LSDS2 - 198KB (.lsd files)
MOVIES - 400MB (.str movies)
OVERLAYS - 226KB (.bin files demo data and .ovr files)

Also when playing in a playstation emulator the emulator "raw envolope data streaming" so i thought the music might be on there as RAW ADPCM but I did try a few bms scripts and tools and found nothing

Oh, if you take a look inside the .bin file with Hex Workshop you can clearly see it is uses CD-XA Format, but maybe only for the videos not the music?

Offset: 0009713 43 44 2D 58 41 30 30 31 "CD-XA001"

Please Help
Thanks Guys
