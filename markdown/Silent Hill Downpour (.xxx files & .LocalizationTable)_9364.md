- Post Title: Silent Hill Downpour (.xxx files & .LocalizationTable)

Hi my English is bad so please keep your thoughtfulness.
I used Unreal Package Extractor, but create a more files in folder name with same name as etract file ...
But file in folder are .LocalizationTable. I unfortunately I can not decode ... File here : 
```
http://file.qip.ru/file/M-dYDcJK/LocalizationTable.html 
```

And I done with translate I pack more file in folder back into .xxx file. I don't know how. 
So actually I need "Pack to .xxx file and Unpack/Pack .LocalizationTable file".
Thanks for help.
