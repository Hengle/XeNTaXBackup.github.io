I've just released a new version of my archive tool RPFTool for Xbox Rockstar archives with Read/Write support so anyone who is interested in modding these games head over to [http://tmacdev.com](http://tmacdev.com).

I did a full re-write from my initial private version so you can only really extract and replace files at the moment but I'm open to suggestions for new features and will implement them when I can.
As the encryption keys for each game are copyrighted material I haven't included them in the release but I'm sure you guys can work them out.

For anyone looking for the keys I suggest you start with working out how the GTA IV PC key is used.
The GTA IV key is easily found with a google search then you can load up GTAIV.exe in IDA, search for the key then work out what reads it. 
Once you've done this load up the default.xex in IDA and look for a similar function and there's your key. The game buttons in RPFTool will only activate when the correct key is available so its easy to see if you have the right one.

Also I'm pretty sure I've posted the RDR key on this forum some time in the past....

You can use the same method for all the games. Also my site is down at the moment as my hosts suspended my account for an unknown reason, hopefully should be back up soon.

Edit:
Site back up.

At the risk of sounding totally ignorant, why not post the keys? It doesn't seem any more or less important than any other archive. Is there a concern about cheating, or perhaps the method used to get the keys?

thanks, but I just figured that this game will never get cracked for it models, unless someone makes an .sprx that can extract the game while in game. the only thing that is "modable", are simple thing like weather and colors. also there's a dev menu but it freezes when clicked on. also all the rpftool dont let you edit in the tool, only able to extract and replace.
