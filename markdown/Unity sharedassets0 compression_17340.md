- Post Title: Unity sharedassets0 compression

Hi,

I was messing around with the files of a mobile game and I failed to open the "sharedassets0.assets" file with tools like UABE/Unity Studio. All other sharedassets loaded fine though.

So I opened the file in the hex editor and noticed that it is not in the same structure as other assets. Normally assets files have somewhat human readable data : 



I am guessing the data is compressed/packed? I tried using offzip with different configurations but no luck. I hope someone can help me recognize what it is.

Here are the files : [https://www.mediafire.com/file/kdbamg69 ... ssets0.rar](https://www.mediafire.com/file/kdbamg69khbzex9/sharedassets0.rar) 
Originally there are 4 split files but I also included a merged file of all 4.

Thank you in advance.
