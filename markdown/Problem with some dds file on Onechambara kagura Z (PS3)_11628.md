- Post Title: Problem with some dds file on Onechambara kagura Z (PS3)

So far I can view/extract/edit some dds images of this game until I encounter this one, the image is kind of jumbled or scrambled on whatever settings I used. So I just try to guest the size and put a block of color if it's the right image and when put back in the game it was there.

here's it's on texturefinder


here's the block of color I replaced the image with, when it's put back in the game


and this is what the image supposed to be



here's the big file where I rip those images
<link removed due forum rules violation>

I don't know how to extract the contents of this file so I just use texturefinder to see the images and rip it with HxD and manually add a dds header
