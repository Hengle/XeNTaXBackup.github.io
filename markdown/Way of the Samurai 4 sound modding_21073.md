- Post Title: Way of the Samurai 4 sound modding

i was able to extract the files from the soundeffects.bra from the game folder and mess around with the files before repacking it back
the edits i make and export of the .wav files dont seem to work ingame but if i swap audio file names between each other in the folder and repack it they work just fine, is there a way to replicate the format or properties of the .wavs from the extracted folder?
