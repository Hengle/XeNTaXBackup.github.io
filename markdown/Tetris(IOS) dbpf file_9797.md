- Post Title: Tetris(IOS) dbpf file

The file is similar to sims3 dbpf file. What included are some kind of utf-8 text files.
I tried this code [here](http://simswiki.info/wiki.php?title=DBPF/Compression).
It does get correct file size, but the file data just a mess.

apparently this format changed to v2.0 when Spore was released and nobody took over development - your sample is v2.1

judged on the fact this is a mature format used by ea, the code you're trying to use from sims wikis will be outdated
