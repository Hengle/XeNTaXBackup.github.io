- Post Title: mechwarrior 4: mercenaries 3D models

Hey guys! this is my first post here  , For a while now I have been going through whole internet in search of few Mechs from this game, Ares, Assassins_2, Behemoth_2 and Canis to be specific for my project! i even went as far as going to the third page of the google   but found nothing....No already ripped models no any tools out there for this D:
What i found was the files of the mechs in this game is encrypted and nothing else, i understand if that is the case but if anyone knows or have already ripped anything can you please tell me about it?? have i missed anything?
Thank you so much guys!

Yes i did but it just extracts it like image on 2d plane, tho you can just scale it in that axis to make it a 3d model but it only has part of the mesh which were visible in the view while extracting with ninjaripper....
I attached some images for the same
