Hello! I had this kind of model archive in my disk c, as I formatted my S.O because had virus, I deleted many convertors and scripts because were infected, as I remember I had a blender plugin for this kind of meshes, but I have tested many of them and none work, so if someone have one that works, please upload it, thanks in advance!

Nobody can help you unless you know what they're from, unless you get the specific plugin for the .skm files from that game it's not surprising they don't work, extensions are not universal. I'm guessing you don't know or you would have found the correct plugin yourself by searching the source name, I'd give up on them, can't be that important if you've forgotten.

Hello! I know the plugins are not universal, and the game name was in vietnamese or chinese but the folder name looks in symbols so no way to get the real name, my bet was that are many people that have .skm plugins installed in blender so maybe one was able to open the samples, because I had the plugin years ago x.x

Thanks Shakotay2! yep I know ! but to do get meshes with the riggs one by one take much time    at least for me, I'm still getting the yulgang models and it took alot of time. Also if I fail a value the riggs are completely wrong xD

I have no time to check it, sorry. But you won't get far if you don't learn to give 3D data a structure.

Example using "table" button of hex2obj:

( one line represents 40 bytes in the model file )

Well, it's so simple: uvs are at pos 12 of the 40 bytes blocks.

Thanks for the info! I was analyzing it and the pos 12 of the 40 bytes is 9DCA , so in step2 in hex2obj:
FVFSize   UV pos
12                99
9DCA          255
I'm missing something

How on earth did your params tell the block size being 40?
Also you didn't get the correct address of the block in the first place. Same problem here:

If you'd ever noticed the 4-byte field before every data chunk, we wouldn't be here for this conversation.
So yeah, you're missing a lot of things. Read the tutorial, with patience this time.

I'm missing somethingEverything. How on earth could you choose 9DCA as a starting address? It's 9DCC. I've rectangled the first normals vector (3 floats). Then the uvs to follow.
.

To avoid further confusions here's the H2O file I used:

0x2A6D6 14232
Vb1
40 12
0x9DC0 3330
020000
0x0 255

Press "UVs" button to see the uvs. Pressing "mesh" shows a sphere, surprise. (You'll need a deeper understanding of math why normals build a sphere, btw. It's because all normals' vector have the length of 1. You can display the normals in blender. So many things to learn. So little time left...  )

Honestly these was my first values because Shakotay says it "vs are at pos 12 of the 40 bytes blocks.", but as my address was incorrect I changed them   
40 12
9DCA 255

Hmm but the pos 12 of the 40 bytes is 16233, that's why I choose 9DCA, i forgot that the following is generally used

I really hate when this happens, sometimes I'm sure about the values but mesh shows like a sphere or rectangle without form and I start to change values x.x  so what could I do to merge the mesh with the uv?   . Thanks shakotay2

You could use 9DCC as start of uv block (UVB). Using params from here of course:

Hello shakotay2! I have encountered a model that seems a bit different because I have tried to find the correct values to show the uv but still cannot, here is my h2o file, would be amazing if you can take a look at it! thanks in advance!
0xE4D8 7260
Vb1
12 99
0xD8 1400

..
0x4544 40Hello, hello, I can't feel the pain but there must be some.  
Size of the uv block is not 40 but 28. It's plain to see when you look at the 0605FFFF "signature". There's an offset of 28 bytes between them.
