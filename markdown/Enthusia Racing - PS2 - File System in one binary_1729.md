- Post Title: Enthusia Racing - PS2 - File System in one binary

Hi!

I would be interested to have a look around the Enthusia Racing content files. The disc structure only has the system essentials and a folder called VOL that only contains the two files in the .zip.
The smaller one, D000.bin is provided as is. The bigger one, D001.bin is about 1.8 GB on the disc and therefore truncated with head and tail in the inside .zip.

The PS2 doesn't have much RAM and the game loads most things quite speedily from disc, so I hope it's nothing too complex. Could you help me with that? I would really appreciate it.
