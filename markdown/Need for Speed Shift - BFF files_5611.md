- Post Title: Need for Speed Shift - BFF files

Hello everybody.
We at nogrip are converting the DLC cars.
But isn't 100%.
One part of the conversion is the UI files, where the exe takes the string of the car, and shows it at the UI.
These files at UI folder are still packed. So, we'll need help with one thing: find a way to unpack these files and make them work. Please, if someone could help, would be welcome.

I didn't realize that you had an issue with unpacking.  I've unpacked the files for you..check back on your thread at the other site.
After you edit them, repack the files into BFFs using BFF tools.

I'm in trouble when repacking. I'll try to edit and send to you at the other site. For don't waste time, I'll add only the Ferrari FXX at the file.
