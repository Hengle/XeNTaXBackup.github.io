- Post Title: problem with Blender exported models in Maya

I started working on a model in Blender (I find it a lot easier to deal with vertex groups there) and exported it into an FBX file.  When I re-imported that to Maya, though, the model was no longer smooth--essentially every part of the mesh was triangulated.  I tried a lot of different things--just about every smoothing function I could find and flipping the normals.  Nothing seemed to work.  

Any tips on how to import a Blender edited FBX  into Maya without trashing it?

Thanks!
