- Post Title: Ninjaripper troubles,

Welp,i think i found one of the few games ninjaripper can't touch.

It already has a d3d.dll present,(even if i delete it it just refuses to work with the d3d9.dll it's given.)

Intruder injecting yields a loading cursor and then nothing.
Anyone got any ideas on how i could possibly get it to work with ninja ripper?

(and yes i've tried disguising the d3d9.dll ninjaripper provides by renaming it to the one that is already present and that only yields this result)
