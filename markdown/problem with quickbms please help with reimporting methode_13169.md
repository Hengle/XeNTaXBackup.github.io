- Post Title: problem with quickbms please help with reimporting methode

hello guys 
im using quickbms for a   long time and it's a very good tool to extract custom archives 
extracting is working fine im using a FEAR script to extract some files from a game using same archive files (.ARCH00) 
but after extracting i moded files and i got a small problem is that quickbms does not extract or reimport files to there original subfolder .. i mean when i try to reimport the files to there original path inside the .arch00 file it just put the files in the root folder of the archive that means the moded files are useless   
i need a method to replace the files in side the arch00 files so the files that i'v moded goes to there original path 
for example i have this archive from the game called A_database.arch00 
when extracting with quickbms and set the output folder it extracts the files in a one root folder calles /A_database/ 
for example i have a files in archive A_database.arch00 and it's in a subfolder like this A_database/weapons/MTA/ak47.mta0
when i extract A_database.arch00 i finde all files including the previous one like this A_database/ak47.mta0 
when trying to reimport it back to A_database.arch00 .. quickbms reimport it back like this A_database/ak47.mta0 
so it deosnt work   
please i need help is ther a commande or something in the script to change
