How can I translate the subtitles in these cartoonish cutscenes? I edited in the strings file but in game it still appears in english...

I mean the memories Geralt have along the game. I found the text in the strings file and edited it but in game it still shows in english. That's when I decided to use an Hex Editor to translate only those cartoonish cutscenes. It worked, but at the same time, it didn't. I translated and when I went to test it, the first two phrases were good, but the third was incomplete, the last word wasn't complete and the game goes to a dark screen, no sound, nothing.
