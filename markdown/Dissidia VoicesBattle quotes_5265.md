Just unpack "PACKAGE.BIN" and you will find voice files. They are in "*.WAV" format.
To play them you need a Atrac3 Codec installed.

You can find info about "package.bin" - [here](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=13&t=3269&hilit=final+fantasy+IX)
And codec in attachment.
Hope this helps.

P.S. Sorry for bump.
