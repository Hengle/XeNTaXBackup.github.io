FF FastFiles are a pain in the ass to parse since they get read in a sequential order so without offsetting or jumping with pointers. I highly doubt you're going to get help from anyone regarding this though I could be wrong who knows.

I extracted the FastFile as "en_patch-extracted.dat". I tryed with a few .FF Viewers, but this programs not importing the .dat file. Is there a way to break the codes?
