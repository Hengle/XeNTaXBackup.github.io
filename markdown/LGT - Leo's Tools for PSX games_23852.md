Leo that you? Many of the links on that site are no longer active. I see you mentioned Fighting Force. Any chance of making a model viewer or something like you had in the screenshot ?

No, I'm not Leo and I don't have all the tools from that forum.

If someone have any backups, sharing a link would be appreciated.

Yes, I would be very happy if some one put all the tools in one archive. Most of the tools were uploaded to datafilehost and it is not possible for me to download them. In addition, even those tools that were posted on Google Drive cannot be downloaded: either it says that there are viruses, or that the file is violating something, or access to the file is simply denied.

Leo's forum seems to be open to the public once again [http://lgt.createaforum.com/index.php](http://lgt.createaforum.com/index.php)
You can download some tools or post reply (like ask for a reupload), while it's active
