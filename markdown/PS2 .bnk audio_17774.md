- Post Title: PS2 .bnk audio

Hello guys!
So i have some bnk files, extracted from Sly Cooper for the PS2. All of the dialog is in .vag files, so i'm guessing that bnk files contain the game's music.
I tried to use almost everything that i found by googling around, like for example bnkextr.exe, but with no luck.
Here's one of those files [https://www.dropbox.com/s/1e0o415w351zv ... r.bnk?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/1e0o415w351zv9s/uw_bonus_library_Underwater.bnk?dl=0)
Any ideas?
Thanks in advance!
