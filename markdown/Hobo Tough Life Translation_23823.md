- Post Title: Hobo Tough Life Translation

Hello friends, I was trying to translate this great game but even with the latest version of UnityEx (free) I couldn't extract the texts, because the game is made with unity 2020.

here is the file with texts:

I don't know of any other methods currently. I can import it back with my paid UnityEX, if that's what you want.

Here I translated a couple of texts in several menus of the game to see if it works, because once another game didn't work for me. Could you compile it when you can and want to? And then if it works I'll bother you one last time.

here is original file:

Here are some translated texts:

Thank you very much for your time.
