- Post Title: Questions about "for honor" forge

I used a lot of methods to obtain the "for honor" model, but I failed

Current problems

I have an old version of the game file, which is not encrypted

I try to open it with blacksmith. It seems that it can, but it seems that I can't export texture and mesh models. Maybe I can't use it. English is not my mother tongue. I have some difficulty.




Then I tried "ubisoft_forge_tool" and got a lot of "data" files, and then I used "Ubisoft_ DATA_ Tool‚Äù opened but failed
