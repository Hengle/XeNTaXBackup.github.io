Hello,

Sorry to barge in but I'm also looking for a way to extract the images contained in these CCS files.
I'm still doing my best to solve this problem by myself but I'd be so grateful if any of you guys could help us x).

Thank you,
Sorans

Hi,

I am kinda new so I might not get anything, but if someone else had figure out the data structure of the file do share it here.
Personally, I am interested on the in-game still graphics. So my main focus (for now) will be on the image files.

Regards,
Raz

It seems that Forte and Satoh were already working on it. Check this topic-> [viewtopic.php?f=16&t=2934](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=2934)

Thanks to Forte's CCS2OBJ tool, I was able to extract bmp/obj files :3 !

(Now I need to understand how he did it, time to learn~ )

Haha yeah, I PMed Satoh and got very useful info.

However I am unable to extract any OBJ nor BMP's, can I know which file you manage to extract using the tool?

Oh and Images can be examined using the GGD image tool. 

Regards,
Raz


Edit: Never mind that I manage to extract the file now. Forgotten that he/she mention that the ccs file in link is tmp so all that I have to do is just to rename the ccs file to tmp.

Sorry for bumping but I have some ccs files that can't get converted to obj using ccs2obj even if I rename it to .tmp , from Naruto Shippuden Ultimate Ninja Heroes 3 for example i try to convert 2ssxbod1.tmp nothing will be in the output folder, all ccs or tmp files that are named like that (bod1) doesn't get converted.

That's likely due to the bod1/bod01 files being character models or at least presumably character models, as far as I'm aware, the latest ccs2obj does not work on characters, as they follow a different format from static objects like scenery.

You could try using the 'no geometry' option if your version has it, which may help you get textures, but it won't grab any model data.

I intend to get back to researching CCS models, specifically for characters in the future, I will attempt to implement my findings in Noesis... if I make any... I'm not the best out there.
For the moment I have other files to look into, sorry for that.

Thanks and it's ok. Please post your results once you got the structure figured out 
Unfortunately I can't find a ccs2obj with "no geometry" option. Just the ignore mdl ...

Oh I see, but I still can't get the textures even if ignore mdl is unchecked

in that case I suggest opening up the CCS/tmp files you have in GGD or tilemolester, I remember having extracted textures for characters that way.

Note however, this will only extract the RGB, and won't save the alpha channel, at least not that I've managed to do anyway.
