- Post Title: 3D Ripper DX

Ok, my very first post, hopefully it will prove useful  .

For anybody who is trying to get models from a particular game, I've discovered a wonderful little program called 3D Ripper DX: [http://www.deep-shadows.com/hax/3DRipperDX.htm](http://www.deep-shadows.com/hax/3DRipperDX.htm)

It can rip models and textures directly from in game. However, it only supports DirectX games and you'll need 3DS Max to import the resultant file (but there is an option to create an .obj file when ripping).

Anyway, I hope it helps somebody.
