- Post Title: BMS script request

Hey guys, can anyone make a BMS script for the install.qik file from HAZE(PS3)

Here's the link to the file [https://mega.nz/#!LrRF0SzB!ym-NTEaSnCPi](https://mega.nz/#!LrRF0SzB!ym-NTEaSnCPi) ... g1P4pETV54 

The existing swbf3.bms(script.0.2.3) for SWBFIII and Haze cant extract it

Thank you!
