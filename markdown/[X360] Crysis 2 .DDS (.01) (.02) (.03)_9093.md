Hi i am having problems with opening .DDS files for a specific game, it appears that they LOOK like they have been split into multiple different files. I have tried rejoining them and i still can't view the textures even though it has a .DDS header.

Can give files through PM?

Cheers

the images look like plain dds files that need to be un tiled.
noesis can do it if you code an image loading program.
