- Post Title: The Sims 3 (Wii .FSB .GENH)

Okay, so I've attempted to run this through FSBext and it says it finds only one .WAV file

But if that were the case, VGMstream or in_cube should have been able to play the file already.

Instead I get a file with the extension .genh with no WAV header.

According to FSBext they're Stereo, hw2d, GC_ADPCM, 44100Hz, 2 Channel, 16 Bits.

Here's one of the FSB files.

EDIT: Ignore me, yet again. VGMstream just wasn't playing them for some reason...
