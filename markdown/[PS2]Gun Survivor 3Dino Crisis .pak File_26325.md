- Post Title: [PS2]Gun Survivor 3:Dino Crisis *.pak File

hello i'm working on a translation for Gun Survivor 3:Dino Crisis Japan Version

But I found a very strange compressed .pak file, I can't tell which compression algorithm it uses.

example file : [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1EA8Chi ... sp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1EA8Chikybl0BmeXzvxCY6a5aKoqA0P_r/view?usp=sharing)

In this game, the header of the texture file is identified as: P2IGa （model is P2OD）

But some texture files stored in adv.pak have incomplete headers (such as P2i, IGa or a lot of missing information) so I think these files may be compressed

Is there any tool to extract/compress Gun Survivor 3:Dino Crisis pak files ？

Sorry For My Bad English
