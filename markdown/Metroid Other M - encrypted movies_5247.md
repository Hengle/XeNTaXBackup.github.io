- Post Title: Metroid: Other M - encrypted movies?

Hi there!
I wanted to watch the movies of Metroid: Other M and from all movie files, only twelve are playable. The others look VERY strange in hex code:

Could they be encrypted somehow? I tried different versions of the game. I extracted them with WiiScrubber, maybe the program got the decryption key wrong? I've attached a file.
Any help is appreciated! Thanks in advance!
