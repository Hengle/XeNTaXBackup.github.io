- Post Title: Decrypt lua files of Cocos2dx ?

Hi everybody,
I want to translate a Chinese IOS game to my language. But I dont know how to decrypt Lua files of Cocos2dx (I'm noob). I read this article but still do not understand: [https://boards.libre.io/threads/decrypt ... es.297552/](https://boards.libre.io/threads/decrypt-xxtea-block-cipher-in-lua-file-from-cocos2d-lua-games.297552/)
So, I hope someone is able to help me decrypt these files, I am extremely thankful
