- Post Title: Disney infinity .dbnk

I'm trying to edit the dubbing of the game, I can extract the files with a .bms script, but I can't reimport them, I get this error:


If I add -. as quickbms says, I get this error:



Can anyone help me with this? In the pc version they removed my language from the game and with much effort I extracted the files from the console version. The problem is that I need to replace the audio files contained in these .dbnk archives, and reimporting is the last problem I have left to solve.



If anyone wants to help me, I am attaching a file of the game:
