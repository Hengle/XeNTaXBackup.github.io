- Post Title: Fallen Earth corrupted TGA & DDS files

Hi all,

I've been working on extracting the resources from the archives for the upcoming MMO Fallen Earth.  I've had some success pulling .dds and .tga files, but I'm still seeing some corruption.  I've simply been using Jaeder Naub, and while it seems to recognize the assets, I'm getting corruption in all the files.  I'm just wondering if anyone has seen something similar or has any suggestions as to what I might be able to try to correct this.

Attached is a zip file containing three jpegs converted from the dds files.

It's also probably worth noting that when extracting the DDS files using Game Extractor, I see the same corruption.  Could this possibly be an encryption or compression issue?

we need an original archive to download to know the issue.
