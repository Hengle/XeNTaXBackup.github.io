Hi guys, I need help with the audio files that I extracted from Titanfall.

I got those .wav audio files (riff header) by using VPK TOOL, however, it can not be played by any audio playersl. Even I imported as raw audio to Audacity, its only noise.

I tried to convert to ogg but it shows that 0x42 fmt if vorb missing...

Anyone can help me with this problem?

Thank you very much!!

Turns out I downloaded the PC copy from 3rd-party website, and there were no any installation which means the audio files was still unpacked.

I got a new copy directly from origin and after the audio unpacking process, now everything works fine.

Thank cra0 to help me figure this out.
