- Post Title: .Nif files from Wizard101

Hey everyone!  

I have a question about the .nif files from Wizard101:
The previous nif files had the version 20.3.0.9 and I was able to open them with [NifSkope](http://niftools.sourceforge.net/wiki/NifSkope) but they changed the file version in the last years to 20.6.0.0 and NifSkope can't display the meshes anymore. I asked in their Discord server why I NifSkope can't display the files and they said that it's not possible to display them 'cause they are "these NiMesh things with datastreams". My question is: Is anyone able to figure out how I can display them? I would do it by myself but I have absolutely no clue how this all works...  
I'll leave an file here so you can look at it.

Thank you, hopefully
