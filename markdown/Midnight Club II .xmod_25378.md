I tried this Noesis plugin from HimeWorks, but it got an error:

It seems that *.xmod files from Midnight Club II are in an ASCII format. I also tried the PKG/XMOD converter, but it's super old and will crash

Anyone found a proper way to import *.xmod files with Noesis or Blender?

(Someone needs to add face indices; maybe auto created ones would do.)
