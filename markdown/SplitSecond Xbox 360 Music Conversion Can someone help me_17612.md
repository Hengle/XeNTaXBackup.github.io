- Post Title: Split/Second Xbox 360 Music Conversion: Can someone help me?

I've recently got back into a personal project on ripping music from Split/Second. I've ripped the music from the PC version just fine, but I'm having trouble with the music from the Onslaught Pack for Xbox 360. 

I found the Xbox 360 DLC pack online and ripped the files successfully using a program (wxPirs) I found on some website. I tried using Aezay's FSB Extractor, but they only come out as unplayable wav files. I encountered a similar problem when I was trying to rip music from The Crew (PC), but I found an FSB Extractor on another website that extracted the music perfectly. I tried using it on the file for Split/Second (I knew it most likely would not work, but I tried it just to be sure). I found another FSB extractor (fsbext on [http://aluigi.altervista.org](http://aluigi.altervista.org)), but it extracted them as .wav.xma.

I can't figure out what to do after this point. I've tried using towav, but it doesn't work. I've tried using almost everything I have and tried looking around online, but I can't really find anything that helps.

If someone can help me, I'd really appreciate it.

Uploading a sample is always a good idea

This is one of the files giving me problems. If me or someone else could transform this one, the rest (I think) should be easy.

I did a little more digging on the internet only to find the answer right in front of my face. I don't know whether to laugh my hind off or facepalm hard enough to get brain damage. Maybe both?

I went and searched "Xbox XMA to WAV" and found the right thing a few pages later on another forum site. Turns out xmash ([http://hcs64.com/vgm_ripping.html](http://hcs64.com/vgm_ripping.html)) and THEN towav was what I needed.

I'm sorry for wasting space and time with my topic.

Ya know, the latest vgmstream release supports FSB with XMA coding.
