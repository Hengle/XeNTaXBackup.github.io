Which files do you have? pk or mdl?
pk to be used with fate-tools; "drag-and-drop pk extract.bat"
Didn't check it but why not drag 'n drop a pk file onto that batch?

mdl: Noesis MDL loader; copy script data_fate_extella.py into [Noesis folder]\plugins\python\
then start Noesis.exe and load a fate-extella mdl file.
