- Post Title: Cold Fear .LNG encrypted files

Hi everybody, i'm new here and I start asking for your help. I'm a brazilian guy, and i'm trying to translate the game; Cold Fear for pc. I looked at the files and discovered that the texts files of the game are in the data folder (Cold Fear\Data\English) into .LNG files. I tried to open it with usual text editors like notepad and others, but it shows up corruted text files. With hex editors is the same, just corrupted text files too. The .LNG files files seem to be encrypted. Well, searching in the web (google), i've found a Russian translation for this game. The Russian language did not originally come in the game, so someone translate it to Russian. I looked at various sites on the Internet but found no group or person who translated it, and did not find any editor tool for the game files. 

Someone here could examine the files to see if you can decrypt it? My dream is translate this game for Brazilian-Portuguese. And I need your help for do this. Thanx very much!

EDIT: The files below must be renamed to .7z

Well, but the Russian files must be placed in the "English" folder of the game, replacing the original files. So I thought it was an unofficial translation. I hope that someone here can help.
