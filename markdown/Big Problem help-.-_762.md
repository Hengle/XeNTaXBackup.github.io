You installed the latest version? If not, make sure you have run the latest one. 

You may also try to delete the user.cfg file in the data\config\ directory, and try the program again.

Well, if it worked before, and it does not now, try tracing back to changes you made to your system during the time after you installed MultiEx Commander initially and the moment it failed the first time. 

It is really weird after all that it worked and now it doesn't. 

It fails on loading internet Connection routines. Perhaps that might hint you in the direction where to start looking.

Hmm, no I don't think so. 

Well, the new upcoming version will not rely on internet anymore, so that might actually work.
