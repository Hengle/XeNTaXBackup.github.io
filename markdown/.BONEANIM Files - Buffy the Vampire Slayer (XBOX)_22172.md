- Post Title: .BONEANIM Files - Buffy the Vampire Slayer (XBOX)

Hello, I am researching the animation files of "The Collective" in the game engine "Slayer Engine". The files come from the game "Buffy the Vampire Slayer" (Xbox version), they look like the game "Indiana Jones and the tomb of the emperor", aslo by "The Collective". I wanted to know if it is possible to open the animation files .boneanim.

Here are samples: [https://www.mediafire.com/file/6nmnz460 ... m.rar/file](https://www.mediafire.com/file/6nmnz4601qyra4i/animation_.boneanim.rar/file)

Thank you

Its not for the animation files, nur maybe for the model files! Getting up also uses the slayer engine.
Shakotay2 helped me out big time to extract .msh models

Is this related to animation files and .msh files?

I think Henchman’s response would help you to extract the meshes which is good, but not the rig/anims unfortunately.

I’m interested in the animations from this game too but haven’t had much luck. I assume that we would need to be able to work out the character mesh/rig files before the boneanim data is useful in any way, but that is beyond my capabilities. 

I assume that the msh file is the mesh, I’m not infront of my pc at the moment, but I think there is another file type .ban (I think) which may be the skeleton/rig for the mesh....but then again I may be talking complete rubbish!

Silent Hill Homecoming and Indiana Jones are among the games that utilize The Slayer engine, if that helps anyone. Hopefully one of the Uber geniuses on here is able to figure it out

Excuse the double post - if it assists anyone with the skills to look further into the anim files, below is a link with the character files that I mentioned in my previous post (msh, ban, gin and mtx texture files) along with a few sample boneanim files that where included in the original post.
