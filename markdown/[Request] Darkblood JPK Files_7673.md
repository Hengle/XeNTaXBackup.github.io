Well, I just found that this format uses variable-length bytes for whatever reason, and I can't get to the other meshes without understanding why sometimes I read a short, while other times I read a byte...

A single mesh struct has been parsed, but it's these variable-length bytes that's making things difficult.

I think the overall format uses single-byte tags to indicate what struct follows.

post a short code snippet of where there is an expected byte and an expected word. it might be like unicode and there is a bit flag or something to signify that this is a byte, word, or dword. lightwave uses variable-length codes too (if 0xFF is the high byte it's a dword, otherwise it's a short for example).

dude korean MMO's are awesome. I don't think I've ever seen an online gaming culture where T&A is allowed!

```
while i < num:
#for i in range(num):
		
		tag = self.inFile.readUByte()
		print(hex(tag), self.inFile.tell())
		if tag == 0x82:
				self.inFile.readBytes(2)
				count = self.inFile.readUInt()
				self.inFile.readByte() #byte or short?
				self.inFile.readBytes(count*4)
				#self.inFile.reaByte() #byte or short?
				self.inFile.readByte()
				self.inFile.readBytes(count*4)
				self.inFile.read('16f')
				i += 1
		elif tag == 0x83:
				self.inFile.readBytes(3)
				count = self.inFile.readUInt()
				self.inFile.readByte() #byte or short?
				self.inFile.readBytes(count*4)
				self.inFile.readByte() #byte or short?
				self.inFile.readBytes(count*4)
				self.inFile.read('16f')
				i += 1
		else:
				print("unk tag", hex(tag))

```


Damn byte or short comments lol
I've noticed that for given "count" values, the "byte or short" is always the same.

But there could be arbitrary number of counts, so I was looking to see if there was some relationship between the count value and how many bytes I should read.

Typically, large counts ==> two bytes, small counts ==> one byte.

At the very BEGINNING of the file, there is one of those variable length fields. For small file sizes, it's 2 bytes. For larger file sizes, it's 3 bytes. I just don't get it.

I might even have to read them 4-bits each rather than as bytes...

And wow, their string lengths are stored as BYTE - 128. What could this mean.

EDIT: crap, I really am supposed to read byte-tags as two 4-bit values...

Finally got the mesh out............
Only to realize that there's a transformation matrix somewhere and I don't know where.



For the byte or short, I checked if count > 128 or not.
Considering how the format checks nibbles it probably has something to do with the values I'm reading.

woah that's pretty nice quality for an mmo. what's the polycount on that one? I stopped working on any mmos since they install crapware. the data structure tended to be amateurish too, like for hreoes of thessolonica. you are making me want to pick one up again lol. so where's the t and a man hahaha?

also,looking at the model, hehehe the most important part, the skirt, one thing I have a hard time finding too in a game, are the transparency and double-sided flags. I hate that man, I am having a hell of a time figuring how the dw games handle transparency since they don't seem to use the alpha channels in the dds. the alpha channel looks like some kind of specular map instead. it is such a pain in the ass to manually set the transparency in a Modeler when there are thousands of models.

About 15k or so, if you add up each part of the body.
Unfortunately the t&a is pretty low-poly compared to the ones over at illusion, which are probably 10-20k alone just to make it detailed.

But man....the game only has swords shields and maces.
What kind of game is that.

I know, what's a t&a game without whips and dildos hahaha.
