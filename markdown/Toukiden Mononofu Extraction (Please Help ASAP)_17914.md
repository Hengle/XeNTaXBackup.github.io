- Post Title: Toukiden Mononofu Extraction (Please Help ASAP)

I'm trying to extract the graphical and data contents of this mobile game called Toukiden Mononofu, but so far I'm having trouble opening both the AB files I backed up and the TAR file I converted into. Could anyone help me out here, please?
