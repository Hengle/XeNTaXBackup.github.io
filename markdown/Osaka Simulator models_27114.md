- Post Title: Osaka Simulator models

There's a game called Osaka Simulator, released some time around 2003. The files are easily available by searching reddit but I'm not sure I should link the whole game here. There's a bit more info [here]([https://www.gaminghell.co.uk/OsakaSimulatorFinal.html](https://www.gaminghell.co.uk/OsakaSimulatorFinal.html))

In the game files, there's a folder called model that has 5 models, called model00.bin through model04.bin, and then another 4 files that follow the same naming scheme but with 'texture' instead of 'model' 

I've uploaded the important files here [https://www.mediafire.com/file/cscolmie ... s.zip/file](https://www.mediafire.com/file/cscolmieln40u62/osaka_simulator_models.zip/file), does anyone know how to convert these to .obj or .3ds?

The game was quite small so I doubt there's any super advanced encoding or whatever
