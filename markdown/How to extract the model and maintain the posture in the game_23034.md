Wow, first time I've heard of someone complaining about not wanting a Tpose lol. Well your best bet in that case is to use 3d Ripper DX, but it only works on 32 bit applications and you need a 3ds max 2009-2010 and the plugin for it that comes with it to import a proper scale of the scene rip.

Thank you, I found that 3DRipperDX does not seem to be able to intercept DirectX 11 (or later)   what a pity

I want to intercept a certain action of the character in the game, and I can pause it in the game. Tpose is very troublesome even if there are bones to pose
