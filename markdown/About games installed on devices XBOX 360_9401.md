- Post Title: About games installed on devices XBOX 360

I would like to take a question regarding the format of the installation of XBOX 360 games.
Resident Evil 5 installed on pendrive and scan the folder of the game he gets this way.


A sequence of data files without extension.

Question what is the advantage of the Microsoft way of doing this because I've been searching for games that are GOD Similarly, it is possible to circumvent their protection locks.

Another thing would somehow able to manipulate and view the files as if it were an ISO image.



I tried to turn those files into the ISO iso2god, but did not work.
The big problem is that my Xbox is original, ie, I have no other JTAG and unlocking.

There's no way to circumvent the security without modifying your Xbox. You'll have to JTAG or RGH hack your system to do it, and either way you'll lose Xbox Live.
