- Post Title: Noesis and FF9 battle zones

Hi,

I'm trying to extract FF9 models using noesis, but I've got a problem with battlefields.

Every battlefields' textures seems to have a bad color palette:



Do you know how to fix this ?

Additionnally, I'm not sure about the rules of this forum. Is this kind of post right ?

Thanks,

Hi, this kind of post should be fine.

So these are battlefields, I was unsure, I thought these were the feild tiles (towns etc).
Have you managed to find the original models for these scenes too? I've found these textures as .tim files (i think it was .tim) but not the battlefield itself.

In the other topic for FFIX people had used PSXVRAM to extract these textures, and I believe there was mention of an offset of some kind, I'm unsure if offsets are possible in Noesis however.

I've found an utility which seems to correctly extracting battle scenes.

I won't post link here, but I think a google search with "battle scenes exporter" should be sufficient 

Now I'm trying to figure how to extract monster data ... it does not seems to have been documented

Just go the monster folder and right click -> extract (the monsters are inside the .db files I believe, but noesis extracts the .db files too).

The tool you refer to is the tool made by Zidane of the Quimm forums right? I checked out his world map viewer, but it was only a viewer and it doesn't extract or export anything sadly.
Noesis is unable to open the world map model files (I can't tell if it extracts the texures or not), I'd really like to check out the world map in Maya too.
