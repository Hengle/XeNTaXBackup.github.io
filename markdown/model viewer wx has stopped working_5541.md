yaz0r discontinued the distribution of his model viewers, although another person took up his work. but i forget the name of the viewer.. chargeur ff? it was another french man that did it..

anyway I have no clue why your viewer stopped working. maybe the animation file is no good

Model Viewer WX D3D9 doesn't work on some computers, even newer ones.

Try this one,

Sometimes you can be missing certain .dlls and other times certain KH files crash the program.

Yaz0r, can't you just release the code so someone could figure out the problem? Is it just his operating system?
