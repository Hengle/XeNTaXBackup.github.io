- Post Title: [Noesis] How to separate LODS from Model?

Hey, new comer to using Noesis.

I've got a collection of models I want to rip and make into a .smd but the model I am trying to export has multiple LOD models which are layered over eachother

Of course its separate in noesis and I can disable the renders in the preview but they still become a single mesh after I export them.

I looked over the export parameters but there is nothing relating to exporting each mesh separately.

If you guys have any ideas how to solve this I'd be more then happy.

If there isn't a way to do this via exporting can I be able to change the material names?

Each LOD mesh is linked to the same texture. 

If I had changed all the lower LOD's materials to something else I could select them and remove them in Blender.

But I can't at the moment because of the "Value is read-only" message. Is there away to set it off being read-only?
