Well, extract models from games and textures its a hard work for the experts, but take thinks from one game like Weapons, Monsters, Npc, Buildings or Terrain Objects and put this thinks or added this thinks to other games can be more nice, but mod games, Online games also its not easy coz its very hard found the converters to the original model file format of the rpg games.

Lot of people made $$$ with this skills, every Admins from free servers are interesting all time in made the best server for the games online installed in their hown private servers, to do this each time this ADMINS need bether 3D objects and this its the objetive of this tread, talk abouth this files formats and talk abouth the Tools to do this. I start with a list of games i know can be moded on this side. And post only the tools can be used do this. Here i post not details, only a resume for 3D part moding.


Game = Mu Online
Tools = Pentium Tools (3D converter)
-------------------------------------
Game = Lineage
Tools = UnrealEngine3 (Gildor have tool)
-------------------------------------
Game = Ran Online

Is it really possible to import from these game with niftools? Last time i tried, i couldn't do this, because of the models were newer engine version than niftools support.

Maybe you have newer version of the game than the one I test?
