- Post Title: Need help getting to VO lines in Arkham Asylum

I know this is a bit stupid of a question but I am not know for being smart and this is starting to bug me. I'm trying to get to the English audio for asylum to pull them mostly for my own amusement, text tones, whatever. I can get the music and SFX out no problems but for some reason no VO lines at all. Any place I would think they would be all it has outside of 1kb package files & face animation files in verity sizes is 1kb soundcue files and 1kb soundnoderandom files but no actual sound files. I have looked it up and google has brought me nothing outside of ways to unpack the files which I already have done that is how I got the music and SFX. I probably over looked something (it happens) but right now I can't think of what so any help would be appreciated.
