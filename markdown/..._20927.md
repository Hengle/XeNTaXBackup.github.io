Sure, added to files.

PB_DT_DialogueTextMaster.uasset
Skip to 373056 (decimal offset) and you will see first TextProperty in action. 373 061 is lenght of the hash, then ANSI hash itself (Fstrings in UE4 assets terminated by \0), then the length of the UTF16LE string (negative) and then TextProperty body itself (UTF16LE, japanese).
[https://github.com/EpicGames/UnrealEngi ... Property.h](https://github.com/EpicGames/UnrealEngine/blob/release/Engine/Source/Runtime/CoreUObject/Public/UObject/TextProperty.h)
[https://github.com/EpicGames/UnrealEngi ... operty.cpp](https://github.com/EpicGames/UnrealEngine/blob/release/Engine/Source/Runtime/CoreUObject/Private/UObject/TextProperty.cpp)

I've looked here but no mention of any hashes.

uasset is similar upk, just a serialized Unreal Package which is collection of objects depending on the game.
Unreal Packages are very sensitive to version, and they change in each version. You can look at an open source project which parses Unreal Engine *.uasset files here: [https://github.com/gildor2/UModel](https://github.com/gildor2/UModel)
So, it's easy to do a custom tool for specific game, but it's not possible to do a generic tool to do handle all games. Each game might use their own classes.

It's just a string. Hash calculations won't fixed in Unreal Engine. Each user of the engine can convert any hash result to a string.

You probably should avoid talking about things you don't have knowledge on. There are a lot of fixed hash-algorithms in UE4 like CasePreservingHash or NonPreservingHash for FName entries, some other hashes based on some custom CRC32 methods for other types, etc

Their name sounds like a hash interface and not actual a fixed hash implementation.
