- Post Title: Opening .dat from unity 5

Hello!

I am pretty new to this but I managed to open the .asset files with Unity Asset Editor.
But when I export it it gives me a .dat file and I really have no idea how to get them open.
The models I want to rip are from a game called Verdun. I want to use some of the models for a animation scene I wanted to make.
I got a sample file of the .dat but I dont know if I am allowed to just post the link here.

Thanks!

Unless .dat is a new thing, .43 files hold mesh information.
