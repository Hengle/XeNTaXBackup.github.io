- Post Title: Ubisoft .tga texture, For Switch

I saw a post earlier about Ubisoft files and Switch textures. Using some other resources I found such as a Just Dance 4 tdt noesis script, I found that replacing the header it produces a broken texture. I've attached a comparison of the two, what the file looks like and what the file is supposed to look like. I'm also attaching the Switch texture from the Just Dance Unlimited service so that you can experiment with the files. Sorry for flooding these forums with Just Dance requests, I created this post because the other Switch texture post didn't help.

Texture from Switch:
