- Post Title: the sims freeplay

hi there i really want to get the sims freeplay objects/cloths so i basically need the meshes plus the texture.
so here what was able to do (not much)
the game use m3g for models and m3g for textures of objects 
texture of cloths use .bar format and there remains the .bin file which im confused to what they contain maybe meshes

list of what i found/tried
1.m3g 
i was able to find the fbx converter which brought me here [viewtopic.php?f=16&t=11095](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=11095)
the converter works on some of the world objects but the actual standalone objects just crash the tool
2.m3g texture 
well i still dont know how to extract the texture out of those m3g files
i found this but it really doasnt explain much [https://ekasiswanto.wordpress.com/2015/ ... -m3g-file/](https://ekasiswanto.wordpress.com/2015/11/27/how-to-view-images-inside-sims-freeplays-m3g-file/)
3.bin 
this files seam to not open at all using any iso opening tools even when adding the .cue files i think they might contain something impotent
4.bar
i havent really did much with this as i have only noticed it exist 

here samples of all the files above including the m3g the crash the tool plus the ones that don't also the texture m3g [https://www.dropbox.com/s/dm5cnytpv7def ... e.rar?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/dm5cnytpv7defzx/simsfreeplay%20files%20sample.rar?dl=0)

thanks for any help i would really appreciate it 
sorry for my English
