- Post Title: Velvet Sundown Models (Tscene)

Hi all,
Is there anyone out there that can assist with converting the models from Velvet Sundown into other formats please. (FBX, DAE, Obj ect). The game is about to go offline for good soon as Tribe Studios will be shutting down sometime towards the end of October due to lack of funds. :`( The game itself is freely downloadable from Steam here:

The character models including the Boat and Tutorial levels seem to be in Tscene format. Having had a look inside the them with a hex editor, I can see references to texture names.

The animations themselves also seem to be in Tscene format. I can provide Tscene models here if it makes things any easier. The textures aren't encoded and are in a conventional DDS format which is openable in the usual image editing applications.
Towards the end of the character tscenes, there appears to be a bunch of bone names in plain text:
