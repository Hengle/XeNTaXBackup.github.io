- Post Title: Resident Evil 5 PS3 .tex convert to .dds

Could anybody look at these files and try make a programme that will convert them to .dds files which are usable within photoshop?

I'll include a PC version of a .tex and a ps3 version. 

Many thanks ~Nightmare

1. Why need you the PS3 textures? The PS3 is not support the MODs, like x360, as far as I know.
2. Just the order of the bytes is changed, like this: PC - 1234 5678 -> PS3 - 4321 8765
Some one, who has time, can make converter or something.
