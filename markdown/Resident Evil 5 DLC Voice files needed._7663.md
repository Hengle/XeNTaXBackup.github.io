- Post Title: Resident Evil 5 DLC Voice files needed.

Hi
New to the forums!
Anyone have the Voice files for Resident Evil 5 Gold Edition? I'm trying to get the Lost in nightmare voice files.

I know it can be done with chrrox's PS3 Arc extracter,but I don't know how to use it and I can't find a tutorial.There ARE tutorials on how to get the textures with the Arc but not the Voice files-_-

So if anyone has the files I'd love you forever!  Thanks.
