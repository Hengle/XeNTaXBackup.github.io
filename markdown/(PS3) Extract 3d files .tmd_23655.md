I can see that there's a table to split the meshes into parts.  I could probably do a Noesis script, but would need a few more examples of meshes, and maybe some of the textures to go with them.

I think chroxx was working on a script aswell but never finished it:

[here](https://zenhax.com/viewtopic.php?t=2765)

The models seem to be divided in .cat, .tdm# and .gtf, the gtf texture files are already readable with Noesis:

[with this](https://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?t=13074#p107740)

Only the tdm and cat files are not.
Also, the game is available in both PS3 and PS4, some of the PS4 files seem to be slightly bigger and with a different endiannes (PS3 little endian, PS4 big endian), here are a few samples of both, I included the same files for easy comparison:

Here in this [post](https://www.vg-resource.com/thread-29836.html) there is a script for 3ds max that supports the ps3 version for this game.

It actually works, thx, it would be nice to have it for noesis since 3ds max is such a pain sometimes
