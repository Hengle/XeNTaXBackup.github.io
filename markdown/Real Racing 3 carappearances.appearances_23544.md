Can anybody help me open this? I'm trying to convert the 3D model of the interior for the cars, but some model's materials are just generically named "mat01-any number". Other people are having this problem too. I'm assuming this file is the file of the materials and where they link them. From @barti 's post he said it's probably an encrypted xml file and he can't find the xor key for it...I'm not that much of a file geek so I don't know what that is. He said he posted a thread in this forum but I can't find it. There's also a file with the same name but with ".nct" appended to it. It has a different date on it. It's probably a file from the new update. I think they changed it.
The files in question:
carappearances.appearances (old file I think?)
[https://www.mediafire.com/file/mo1ugr5q ... ances/file](https://www.mediafire.com/file/mo1ugr5q9gujrz7/carappearances.appearances/file)
carappearances.appearances.nct (prob new version file)
[https://www.mediafire.com/file/5qis8fn1 ... s.nct/file](https://www.mediafire.com/file/5qis8fn1y5kx9z7/carappearances.appearances.nct/file)
Thanks in advance.

I found an RR3 XML encrypter/decrypter script on quickbms, but it most of it is unreadable.
