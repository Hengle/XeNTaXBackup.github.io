- Post Title: Transformers Game Models

I'm trying to find a way to convert the game models for Transformers The Game for the PC. All I know is that the models are .GHG type files, and QuickBMS is no good for me unless someone can help me out on that. I'm trying to get the drones from both campaigns

Also, does anybody know how to convert the .STR files from the Revenge of the Fallen PC game, or have any ideas on how I can get all the models in the game, I'm trying to get all the enemy units in the game.

Any help from either the two will be nice.

This [http://bit.ly/1kfliGb](http://bit.ly/1kfliGb) is your way to go, no idea how to unpack files if they are packed tho.
