"scripts" is a Starforce encrypted archive so I can do nothing with it.

Ah I see, so it's possible that file is related to that database after all but with that encryption there's no way to properly check.
(I do not know how it works but many eastern-European titles uses similar protection from modifications such as early versions of Void/Turgor to name one example and it's apparently very difficult to work with.)

Good to know though.
