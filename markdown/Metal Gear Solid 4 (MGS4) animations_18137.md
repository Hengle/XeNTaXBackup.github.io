Metal Gear Solid 4 (MGS4) animations

Usage:
mgs4_anim [MTAR] [MDN]



p.s. if you add 3rd parameter, tool will export only keyframes (without interpolation). It will make animations MUCH smaller, but may cause interpolation issues in rare cases.

example: mgs4_anim 00.MTAR 00.MDN no

Hi Daemon, thanks for you tools again!

Can we do cutscene animations with this?
