- Post Title: Original Xbox model viewing

Hey folks, great community you have here. 

I'm a student 3D artist and I wanted to get an up-close look at some of the models and textures from original Xbox titles. I'm working with Toe Jam and Earl III at the moment and had a hard enough time extracting the files from the disk onto my PC. Now I have the archive DATA files which are clearly used for the game, however, I am having a tough time figuring out how to find specific models and view them. Some of the file types which seem like they could be the 3D models have the extension .FUNK, which seems game specific. 

I'm quite experienced with building games from the ground up, but this is my first time down the rabbit hole of backwards engineering this type of thing, so any help would be appreciated and it seems like this is the best place on the net for that advice. 




Thanks

It wouldn't hurt if you posted some samples and we'll tell you what they are.

Good point.

Here's a link to one of the '.funk' files which I believe to be the 3D models.
