- Post Title: Okami HD PC Textures

Hello! I am new to XeNTaX and don't really know a lot here :p

So my problem is that after using ffgriever's tools(encdec and then pack) some .dds textures are just write/blank 64x64 or 32x32 squares. I don't think that it should be like that. Also etc/core_20.bin_dir/MessCore.DDS is fine though etc/core_20.bin_dir/MessRuby.DDS is a 64x64 white square. Could someone help me with it? I would appreciate some help with font glyphs establishing, too. That's for a translation project.

Thank you,
Jaan

I would suggest to contact ffgriever and ask him for support.
