- Post Title: .SkeletalMesh

Hello. I have looked everywhere and even tried Blender and unreal engine (among other programs I found)... but I cannot for the life of me seem to be able to open the file format ".SkeletalMesh". I am trying to modify a mod from Xcom 2, and a few of the files I need to modify are .SkeletalMesh formats.

I have asked in other places, and no one seems to know how to open those. I am hoping you guys would know. I did, however, find a site called MK9 and that one spoke briefly about the .SkeletalMesh, but their download section is down... so,  at this point, I wouldn't trust to be able to get any software from there.
