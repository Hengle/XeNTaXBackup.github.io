Hey,

Yep sure, I will look in a few days.

Just so everyone knows, I havn't really done much looking at requests over the last week, and I won't be doing much this week either, because I am in the middle of my final university exams. When I am finished, or near finished, hopefully I will be back on track with all this stuff.

Thanks guys.

Im bumping this, I got curious.
 I want to analyze this one myself, are there someone who could send 
me the whole datafile some way?

this game seems rather....difficult to find.....

Don't waste your time, it's a zip archive xor'ed with 0x55.

Excuse me if I get this wrong, but does it mean you know how to handle this file?
So it would be possible to extract and replace files in the file?

What he says it that it is a normal .zip file,with each byte XORed with 55. SO, if you XOR each byte with 55 again, you will end up with the ZIP file.you can then open it and alter it like you want. Then,XOR it with 55 again.
