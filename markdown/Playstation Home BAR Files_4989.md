I would like to say that I also have interest in seeing the advancement of .BAR extraction and compression. Six (known to me) .BAR files currently in use by PlayStation Home are labeled as:

COREDATA.BAR
DYNFILES.BAR
POOL_BOWLING.BAR
SCENE_APARTMENT.BAR
SHADERS.BAR
SPURIOUS.BAR

The original Home beta had a few different .BAR files and they all worked relatively well with the previous extractor. Unfortunately, UNBAR does not work so great with the new Home .BAR files. The only luck I managed to have was from a few extracted .XML files.

I'm not going to post any of these files for legal reasons, but if you would like to get your hands on them for educational purposes then I've found that extracting a PlayStation Home .PKG file (update/install) is the best way of acquiring them.

Thanks to those interested!
