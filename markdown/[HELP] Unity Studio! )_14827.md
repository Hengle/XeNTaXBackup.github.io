- Post Title: [HELP] Unity Studio! :)

Hey! I posted on the other category 3D/2D Models but no one seemed to have interest in helping me . Maybe I posted it in the wrong section but anyways I need help to extract terrains on Unity Studio or even a way to extract them with any program, by the way I can extract models just fine. If you know please take 1 minute of your time and help. Thanks alot !
