- Post Title: Klonoa Lunatea's Veil .BIN format

This is a intresting case here. I can confirm that .BIN is an archive. PSound can load sound from it and GDD can view some textures in it. There's probably models in it as it's the only place in the games data they can be, but I've had no luck getting any models from it.

Okay I might be an idiot about the .BIN format.
Turns out there's a script that can open the .BIn format, but I'm not entirely sure how reliable it is, as it shat out a lot of dummy files, including .txt files for some reason.

All of the files contain models, sounds and texstures. It's a mess really. .DC5 and .NFC are files of intrest, along with .DAT.
