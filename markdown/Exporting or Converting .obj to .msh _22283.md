- Post Title: Exporting or Converting .obj to .msh ??

Hello guys, i'm here to ask if anyone know any way to export or convert a .obj file to .msh.

I converted a .msh file to a .obj to edit on Blender and/or 3ds Max, but after the edits i wanted to convert it back to the default .msh format.
PS: I want to convert the obj back to that .msh format, to re-use!

Link to get some samples of mesh (.msh) and their textures (.dds):

Feel free to PM me if you have any proposal! 
Anyways, thanks for the attention!
