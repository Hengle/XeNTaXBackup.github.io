- Post Title: PACK files Nier Replicant

Can anyone help me with a program to export and import the files inside these pack files?

[https://github.com/yretenai/kaine/tree/develop/research](https://github.com/yretenai/kaine/tree/develop/research)
This extracts the files, but does not reinsert them into the pack file.
The game does not start without the pack files.
Some text cuts out if I edit the pack file directly.
