- Post Title: 10$ for fixing script

Hello, first sorry if i put topic in wrong place. 
I can pay 10$ for fix 2 scipts. I mean from there:
[https://ps23dformat.wikispaces.com/Seri ... +Encounter](https://ps23dformat.wikispaces.com/Serious+Sam+Next+Encounter)

As you see on pics, meshes are wrongly exported. 


I'll pay 25$ for someone if can make script or program which could export Serious Sam Next Encounter levels to Serious Editor (Serious Sam the Second Encounter). I think it is possible, because Next Encounter developers first worked on Serious Editor and then saved maps export for PS2 and GC platforms.

Unless someone around here is so godlike to be able to do it in 15 minutes, your offer is almost offensive.
