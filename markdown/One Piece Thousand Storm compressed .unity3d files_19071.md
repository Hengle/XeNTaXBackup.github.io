- Post Title: One Piece Thousand Storm compressed .unity3d files?

so i finally got my hands on the files (im an idiot and didnt realize the game just...downloads them to your device) but now i've hit a roadblock. the .unity3d files for the models seem to be encrypted somehow, so i cant open them in asset studio or anything. if anyone could help me crack into these i'd really appreciate it. here are some sample files: [https://sta.sh/0fbnwh3cfnu](https://sta.sh/0fbnwh3cfnu)
