Ghost Recon 2, i presume, still uses the Unreal engine, as with Ghost Recon 1 and all the other Tom Clancy games. If this is the case, MexCom cannot handle these files as-of-yet.

If you would like us to have a look at the files anyway, just attach a small file (<2MB) to this forum, or email a file (<4MB) to one of us. My email is [watto@watto.org](mailto:watto@watto.org) , and Mr Mouse's email is at the bottom of [http://multiex.xentax.com](http://multiex.xentax.com)
