that file is part of a game developed by Southlogic Studios.
I figured the file format of Deer Hunter 2004/2005 (demos included) a week ago so if you have one of these two games go [here](http://aluigi.org/papers.htm#quickbms).

while if you have another game tell me its name.
as far as I know they developed only another game called trophy hunter 2003

the compression is the classical zlib one and is applied to the filetable and optionally to the files (XTYPE & 1), the rest is encryption (visible in the script through the x10194eac variables)

Well if you need to repack some files, try to put together some of them manually with a hex editor.
Then you can use zlibc or another tool to compress them.
Normally you are lucky if you get an unpacker, someone doing a packer as well is quite unusual.

How is that work ?
Exactly.
But if you don't have any experience with file formats, compression and stuff this is going to be hard. Esp. if encryption is used like bugtest said.

Like I already said, you're lucky if someone writes an unpacker or a script for a less popular game. Packers are kinda seldom.

Most people don't have the skills to write a packer. Those who have lack time.

However, most games with archive files somehow support using files in extracted form as well. Maybe that's worth a try.

Look, Deve, I have been informed by several members here that you more or less stalked them with this request. You lied about the need to repack the files as you know the game runs also with the unpacked files. The fact that you have edited all of your own posts here and removed all text shows that you had plans with the repacking that you did not want others be able to do. This is against our policy, which is open source. So just leave. You should have been thankful for the people that wanted to help you out (and did!), because it seems you lack the skill to do it yourself. Don't pester those that were willing to help you. It never works.
