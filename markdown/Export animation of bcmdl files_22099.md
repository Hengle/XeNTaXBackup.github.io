- Post Title: Export animation of bcmdl files

Recently, I was trying to extract some 3d models from the game Project X Zone.
With the program "Ohana3DS", I successfully extracted textures, models and skeletal animations, but some models have other types of animation, such as "material animations" and "visibility animation", these are not recognized in Ohana3DS, but with the program "Every File Explorer" they are recognized, but it does not have the function of export them.My computer does not have the requirements to run the program "SPICA", which could possibly be a better option. So I have this problem.

Here's an example, it's a simple light that turns on and off in the game. It is classified as Material animation:

Sorry if there is something wrong with the text, I am using google tradutor, I don't speak English.

I have no idea how a material animation should be exported (other than a series of textures for example)

Thanks a lot for the help.  I'm just going to ask: Are the lights (This model) in SPICA are animating? Or are they just being recognized?

I would not call it "animated" - the light just changes its intensity.

PERFECT, this is the right function of this model. I don't want to take your time, but could you just test this one more? It's a little more complex, but it's still just another material animation.
