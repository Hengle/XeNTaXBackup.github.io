- Post Title: I request 3dmax script for King of Fighters 14

I request to import the King of Fighters 14 model into 3dmax script。I've used quickbms to unzip the game, but I don't know what a model file is. I need a 3dmax script, maybe I will know what a grid model file is.

Please give me at least some tips. I am really interested.

Please, buddy！Thanks

  I heard that there was a friend named killercracker, but I couldn't find the max script he wrote. I'm sure there is a grid model in the ADY home folder, but I'm not sure about *.cact or *.cast? Or is it another file?     Sorry, I don't understand many questions. If so, can the grid file be directly imported into 3dmax?
