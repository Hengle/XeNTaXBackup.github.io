Hello.
I was wondering is there a way to extract .kar file extension for this Japanese MMO action online game.
I'm still very new to this type of thing so please pardon me.

There is some extractor which is able to list content of this archive

But is seems that you need a proper password to extract and this might be tricky to solve.

By the way, how did you get those kar files if this mmo game is closed?

this is the sequel to that game.
but it seems like the same engine as the first game or so I thought.

on how I still got the game files?
well, I never deleted the files of this game so it's still on my pc even after the game is closed
