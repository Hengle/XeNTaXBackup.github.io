- Post Title: DOS version of Bram Stoker's Dracula (1993)

Hello!

I'd like to figure out how to extract the music from the DOS version of Bram Stoker's Dracula: 
[http://www.mobygames.com/game/dos/bram-stokers-dracula](http://www.mobygames.com/game/dos/bram-stokers-dracula)_

I tried all the applications that scan files for images and audio files that are linked on the site. The only thing that was in any way helpful was MultiRipper 2.8 (couldn't download the latest version, the link on the official site is dead). It extracted the sound effects, in VOC format, that were stored in a file called sff.pac, but got nothing from other files.

I don't really know how to proceed, so I thought I'd ask here. 

The attached archive contains a sample of the file types used by the game. I could attach the entire game since it's very small, but I assume that wouldn't be appreciated. I did actually pay full price for this back in the day, two large floppies, now sadly lost.

Anyway, any help would be appreciated, and if anyone wants me to post more files, I'd be happy to.
