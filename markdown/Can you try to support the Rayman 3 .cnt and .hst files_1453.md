Hi,

I'm new here, can I start requesting?

Hey, could you try and add support for Rayman 3 *.cnt and *.hst archives?

Sorry, but I was not able to post any example;   ( They are way too large )

And some demos:

[ftp://ftp.ubisoft.fr/demos/pformes/Rayman3_demo.zip](ftp://ftp.ubisoft.fr/demos/pformes/Rayman3_demo.zip)
[http://www.gamershell.com/download_1164.shtml](http://www.gamershell.com/download_1164.shtml)

Okay, I guess this is good now, I'll end the post now!

lol

please...

The CNT files ( textures ) are used in Rayman 2 and Rayman M too...
And I can open the HST files already, but in there are several ADPCM sounds and I can't play them... If I could convert them to PCM...

Hi mate,

We will be happy to help, but you will have to supply us with some archives to look at. You said that they are too big, so therefore download the file cutter program from [http://www.watto.org/extract/download/cutter.zip](http://www.watto.org/extract/download/cutter.zip) . Run the program, and choose one of the archives from the game. Click the OK button, and it will make a zip that you can post here or email to us.

Thanks mate.

Ok... I will send the file soon ( I posted a demo too, and a .cnt file is included in it... )

And I CAN open the .CNT files in game extractor, it says File 00001, then File 00002, and more, but I don't know what to do! 
( There is a plugin in game extractor for Rayman 2 ((*.CNT)), but it can't really open the cnt file from rayman 2, M, and 3. Well, it can, I explained above   . If that plugin would work, then I could extract the files... )

here it is: [http://www.megaupload.com/en/?d=038VYUB5](http://www.megaupload.com/en/?d=038VYUB5)

You need to wait 50 seconds and then click the download button next to the megaupload logo.

Hi mate,

Just because it says File0001 etc doesn't mean that it did not work, it just means that the archive doesn't have any filenames in it. I will be checking the plugin anyway, but chances are it does actually work correctly.

The annoying thing is that, because there are no filenames, you need to try and work out the type of file yourself. Hopefully the name of the archives will help determine the content type (eg sounds.cnt or something similar would undoubtedly have *.wav files in it), or you can just try a few different extensions on the files and see if you stumble across a winner 

Yeah, its annoying, but there isn't all that much that can be done otherwise 

I will check out the plugin on the Rayman 2 archives I have, and have also downloaded the link you supplied and will check that file too.

Well, but I covered there are folders in the archives and they don't show up!

Actually, Watto, it seems to me there are filenames in there, and they are encrypted.

Yeah. I have level files and they use the .cnt file and say what files to use ( like 'factory\facfloor.tga' ) ( the textures I want to rip are .tga files, I tried extracting with game extractor and rename to .tga but that didn't work ) Shall I post a level file too ( they're not that large, just 4 MB or something )

That would be very helpful.

Ah ok maybe that is the case - I will have to take a look at my specs. I have confirmed that Rayman 2 archives work though.

Will take a look at the archive soon - see if I can work out the filenames or something for you.

Ok, I figured out the encryption method, Droolie. Also, check your PM.    Working on finalizing the plugin for MultiEx Commander.

Ah, I didn't realise I had already a working plugin .. LOL. 

Here it is, you should create a CNT folder in the data/plugins folder of MultiEx Commander. Then copy the dll to that directory. Start up MultiEx Commander and you should find that you can see Rayman3 .CNT files in the Open Archive select format list. Extract at will!

I don't know. They are not TGA files probably. I looked around a bit, but couldn't readily decipher what format they were in. Perhaps they only saved the data part of JPEG. In the executable I found a lot of error messages dealing with the JPG format, so that may be one format they use. I also found references to DXT1, DXT2 etc, which would mean .DDS files.

I tried renaming them to .tga, .jpg, .JPEG, .dds files. None of them worked ( I tried them with several programs... But... Did you look at the level files in the demo ( with Notepad ) ( the *.lvl files ) ? You can see there they are .tga...

Yes. but those :

1. refer to other files, or
2. refer to the original graphics before conversion. 

Also note that they are not with many.

The authors saved files with the .gf extension. They must have had a reason for that. Perhaps it was their in-house format.

This is no easy task, perhaps not that difficult, but it is time-consuming.   

I made sure you could extract the files with the correct filenames, though.   That's my contribution. Perhaps you could visit boards that also want access to the game's resources and discuss this with them?

Maybe... But I think I'm almost the only one who wants the textures  

But anyways, I recieved a mail from WATTO, and he added support in his program too ( also for Rayman2 and RaymanM ), so when I find the extension, I could extract all gf files...

I don't quite understand. You want to extract .gf files from the other Rayman games?

Hi guys,

He wants something to convert the *.gf files into another format, and then back again. I told him I would have a look, but I'm not very good at this stuff so I'm not expecting anything terribly benificial

Hi guys,

Yes sorry for the delay - I don't usually have much of a problem when people post requests but unfortunately over the last week I just put all this stuff on hold while I completed some university work. I have got about half of it out of the way, and although I still have more to do I expect that I can look at some of this stuff again tonight or tomorrow.

I am sorry about the delay, but my education comes way ahead of my hobby. I imagine it would be a similar situation with Mr Mouse.

Well I took a look at some of the files, and I can kinda see how it works, but I am not sure if I can do anything with them  . The way it appears is that there is the color palette at the beginning of the file, followed by the pixel indexes, and then some other data at the end. However, there are some problems...

1. Some files don't have the color palette at the beginning
2. I can't find anything that tells the height/width of the image
3. Even though it looks like a paletted image, the actual pixel indexes still seem to be grouped in 32-bit blocks, which would suggest a true-color image rather than a paletted image.

Its kinda confusing  . Here are some screenshots I made of 2 images I looked at - it appears as though the pixel data is in the middle and the palette at the top. I just fed the source images into a simple image analysis program I made, so don't think I'm close to getting it :S

 

Can anyone else help out some more on this - I don't really know what I'm doing  . I have attached the 2 source images shown above to this post, so you can all look at the same ones that I am looking at.

I'm very, very, very sorry for the big bump...

You're not on your own anymore now...   
I also tried your method ( but kinda different: I removed the header and loaded it as RAW data trying oh so many codecs, since RAW data is a sound without header ) It was a very very bad sound file, but I did recognise a bit of music in it. 

Anyway, I didn't have the chance to get your song from Sendspace. The download slots were always busy when I tried and then it got removed. -_________-

By the way... I have ripped the songs now ( from the PS2 version -> Way easier to find out the format, but way harder to actually assemble them, since they are divided in parts of a few seconds o_O I hope that's not the case for the PC version... ), but the problem is I accidently did it in mono, so I'll have to restart the whole process.

Bit of a late bump here

I too have been trying to get access to the audio from the data.hos file. With the kind info from Droolie I managed to get at least the adpcm audio from the PS2 version to play using Cube Media Player.

But not at all easy to find the specific part, as it has many different settings to choose from (no guides around to help either)

* Audio reading buffer time
* Adpcm track split ignore block
* Adpcm block error detect level

Have tried various settings with these, each with very different results (few files, tons of them or just crashes)

Seems like need lot more testing, somehow.
