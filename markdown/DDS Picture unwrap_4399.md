- Post Title: DDS Picture unwrap???

Hi!

yes you have right read it, i ask, about where is possible to understand the wrap system as DDS picture use into game, to wrap original placement from model texture.

this is general question, so all 3D model into Game we use DDS picture format, after conversion from Original TGA file format into DDS, the DDS conversion, cut in different size, the original picture, so this give a puzzle to come back on old model placement picture.

So have you knowledge about wo, DDS cut system handle?
this appear mainly on Building 2D-3D Model.
So to what reason, DDS should only apply this cut system on Building model, and nothing on other 3D model?

many thank's!
