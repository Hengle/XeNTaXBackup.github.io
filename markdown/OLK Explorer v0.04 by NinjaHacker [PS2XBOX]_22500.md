- Post Title: OLK Explorer v0.04 by NinjaHacker [PS2/XBOX]

NOTE: I am NOT the author of this tool, nor am I posting this on the author's behalf. The author has disappeared long ago and this post serves as a preservation of this tool.

Summary:
The OLK Explorer made by NinjaHacker is a tool which can open ".olk" files found in some Namco games like Soul Calibur, and some Tacmo games like Dead or Alive. This version of the tool can identify file formats of Soulcalibur 3 specifically. However, it can modify any other Namco and Tacmo game using the OLK format.
