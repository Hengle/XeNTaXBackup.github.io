- Post Title: Among Trees (Unity Text Problem)

Hi everyone.

I was able to find the text files of this game. But I have a problem. The number of text files in this game is extremely high. Of course, most games made with Unity Engine have the same text files.

I wanted to say does anyone have a solution to how to extract and translate these types of text files in another way?

I have to say that I have no problem translating them. The only problem is that the number of these files is so large that it is almost impossible to translate them: | And very hard.

Because each dialogue line or text of the game is in a separate file that is very insane.

did you extract all the files?
It happened to me to translate games with more than 20-25 files containing the translations, and each file referred to a particular situation (e.g. a file for Tutorial, one for UI, scenario 1, scenario 2, scenario 3, technologies, tooltips, common etc)
After you have studied all the files, and after you have a complete view you can start translating...
So without more information I don't think anyone can help you....

Also, it seems strange to me that everyone refers to translation text files... usually I find it in one asset, and inside it there are more files related to the translation. I have hardly ever found loose files in all folders...

Thanks for the recommendation.

But there is a problem, I said I have no problem with translating these files, I know how to unpack and pack them again after translation.

The problem is that the number of these files is more than thousands. And if we want to translate them, it does not make sense.

Some games made with Unity Engine have clear text files. For example, there are no more than one or three files and their format is text that can be easily translated.

But the problem I have with some of these games is that it is clear in the picture.
And this picture is just a few text files of this game. The number of these files is more than thousands.

1. You have to separate the files that are to be translated!
2. You have to use a text optimization program!
for repeated texts and other variables.
My name Jonas
My name Jonas
My name Jonas
Showing even texts to me several files!
Text optimization program!
My name Jonas

3. In other models use programs to clean texts!
id 0001 ="Car"
program that cleans the texts!
car

@jonasjtg, that is something that most CAT programs are capable of e.g. OmegaT  [https://omegat.org/download](https://omegat.org/download)
