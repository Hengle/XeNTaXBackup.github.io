- Post Title: Need help with FSB files

Hello everyone, newbie here.

So I extracted some FSB audio files from an app and tried converting them with Aezay FSB extractor, but I keep getting the error: Not a valid FSB file format (FileID: 0x00000000).
Is there anyone who can help me out here? Thanks.

In case you need to see, here's a sample of the files:

It is not a FSB file, it is just a blank file with no data when looking at it in a hex editor.

Ah, I must have extracted it wrongly. I used Unity Studio to do it, what's the correct way?

Nevermind, found out I was using an outdated version of Unity. Thanks guys.
