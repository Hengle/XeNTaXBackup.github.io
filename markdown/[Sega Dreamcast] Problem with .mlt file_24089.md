- Post Title: [Sega Dreamcast] Problem with *.mlt file

Hello everybody. I am trying to extract the data from a file of theTokyo Xtreme Racer game, which contains some songs that cannot be extracted normally. For this I am using a Python script developed by kingshriek but I can't get it to work because it causes a syntax error. You can download the script from this web page [http://snesmusic.org/hoot/kingshriek/ssf/](http://snesmusic.org/hoot/kingshriek/ssf/)

I attach a photo of the line where the error is found. I hope you can help me

It seems that you are using Python 3, but you need Python 2 for this script.

Hello. Sorry for taking so long to answer ... I was able to get the script to work using Python 2 but extracting the file creates another mlt file with the same size

You can try to ask script's author for support.
