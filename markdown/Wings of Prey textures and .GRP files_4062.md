- Post Title: Wings of Prey textures and .GRP files

Hi all, 

The WW2 flight sim Wings of Prey came out in January and I was hoping to be bale to unpack the texture files that make up the aircraft skins and do a little bit of modding of the paint schemes. This was all pretty straight forward in IL2 Sturovick and HAWX (2 other flight sims I play) but I am stumped by Wings of Prey files types.

I have found what looks like the aircraft model and texture files (you can also see these in the Demo version) but cannot find any way to open them.

I think the textures are in the .GRP files but cannot find anything about this file type on the web except a bit here and some stuff about Starcraft bitmap files (pretty old and unlikely to relate to this game).

Does anyone have any ideas how I can unpack the GRP files? I can upload them (from the demo version) if it helps?

Many thanks
