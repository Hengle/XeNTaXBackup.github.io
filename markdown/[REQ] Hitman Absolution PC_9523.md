I thought I might start this thread, the game comes out in November but the demo is out for quite some time now.
Its only available for people who pre-purchased it sadly, if you need a sample file please PM me.

All game files even the bink videos are in .pc_xxx files. xxx in that case can be "binkvideo" "resourcelib" "headerlib" etc. Most files have cryptic numbers as file names, except the videos.

No not the game but the Demo (Sniper Challenge). I'll send you a PM tomorrow. If I don't send you one to me so I get an e-mail notification or write in the thread.
