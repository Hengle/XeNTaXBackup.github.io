- Post Title: Deer Hunter 2016 {Unity Game) Models

Hi, Im trying to extract models and assets from a game for Android called Deer Hunter 2016.

The Game is made with unity, but when I tried extracting the files from the game with a Unity Model Extractor, there were models or textures in the AssetBundles, but not all of them were there to be extracted, I was wondering if I could have some help extracting the assets from this game.

If anyone knows how or can help me, I would appreciate it.

thanks in advance.
