- Post Title: Ninja Ripper - game map coordinates of static meshes

Hello dear gamers, modders, programmers and developers.

I'd like to rip every meshes and skeletal meshes by default but including map cordinates. Yes, It allow to export models of characters, meshes, textures loaded from running game, but I want to ask what 'Arg' (specific command line) are using by Ninja Ripper, there's a Arg that export whole map from game in one file with groups? In short, is possible to load whole Map instead build from single meshes as a group in 3Ds Max to drag texture to single mesh?

Thanks
