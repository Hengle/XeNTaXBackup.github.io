Hello folks, well with help of Ekey I unpack some files of this great game, the problem is Noesis script won't detect version of Gamebryo 20.5.0.0 so my question is if somebody can give me help to load them?

Not sure what you're talking about, these all load perfectly in Noesis. If you're thinking there's some error in the loader causing the faces/etc. to not load, that geometry is simply not in the nif. (you can see clearly that no unhandled nodes contain it and the textures aren't in there)
