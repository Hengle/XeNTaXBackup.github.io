- Post Title: Heavy Rain Tools

I'm working on Heavy Rain Tools, to I can translate the game.

I'm very at the beginning of the develop/research! This is so far done:
- dat/d00/d01... unpacker
- segs unpacker/repacker

Because the tools are too big to upload here, available from here: [https://dl.dropbox.com/u/4953836/Xentax ... inTools.7z](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/4953836/Xentax/HeavyRainTools.7z)
Because I don't have the header of the dat files with the size data of the inner files, I had to use search. The result of this search is the .fff files. The researching a very long progress, that's why I made these header files. Faster to use those to unpack files.

Future plan:
- texture unpack/repack (probably not all, I just want to find the fonts)
- text unpack/repack (so far I found 2 different format text files)
- dat repack (with size limit, because I can't edit the header of the dat files)


I found an interesting text format inside the game. Now I try to crack it, because until I can't edit that, there is no point to working on other parts of the game.

Wow, you're great
edit: managed to extract the segs from the bigfiles, and when i use heavyrainsegs to unpack the segs it will just uncompress the segs but how can i extract the files from the uncompressed segs?

i think he's still working on it and i think you need to give him little more time probably because he's working on other games.

This projekt is resting. I'm out of ideas, ritght now in case of "hacking" the text file. If I start over the researching later, maybe I'll find something new.
But one thing is sure, I'll start over just next year.

BigFile_PS3.dat files - invalid file path, after unpacking 247 files.

Path - G:\3\BigFilePS3_dat\

Another files also have it.

Maybe, is it because I use another version:

Yeah maybe. Probably some size of the inner files different between the versions.
I'm trying to "hack" the header file of the dat files, and that'll solve the problem.

Afaik Chrrox is still working on it. The format is not exactly easy to figure out, so it requires time and a lot of patience.
