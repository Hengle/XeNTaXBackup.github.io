Well, you see, we can't really help out here, as we need examples. If there's no demo, this might be a problem. Just giving a link to a program which can already do it, won't help out much, as reverse engineering that would cost too much time.

Well, that could help. Perhaps first try to list the contents of your game's directory, see if anything interesting is in the name of the file.
