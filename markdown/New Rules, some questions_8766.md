Well i think its the end of the way for lots of Users, i shure not lot of people like enter only to talk, u know the file sharing its a strogn part of the forum, search solution for unpack sound, textures, models, engines etc its the hobie of lots of users, the work of the coders its help to the hunters of new and old games to find solution, the work of the noobs its search new game files and give to coders to unpack, disapointed the 99% of the games are copyrighted, then can somebody post a list of non copyrighted games?

Nes Emulators maybe?  

I use this post i made here in Xentax to give thanks to all the greath People like Mr. Mouse (at least i understand your position, more afther i see MEGAUPLOAD ITS KICKED BY THE FBI,) Zskaradek, chroxxx, finale, critical herror, fatduck, mariokart etc etc, thanks to all boys and keep in the line. from your friend Rimbros.

I think you see things all wrong Mate.
I find that if one can only work by posting open links to protected files in an open forum they are lazy!
I don't care if some of my friends use drugs and visit me from time to time, but I don't want them selling those drugs from my house!!
That's what your doing with open links to files here!
You may not get heat but this forum will.

This is how I see the rules

1: samples? --> go to another forum that will provide them. Better they get shut down right? lol
2: discussion --> come here

How about I just go to P*C for samples.

That's still reference to copyright material.

xentax --> link = banned
xentax --> 3rd party --> link = banned

As all things go, people will gravitate towards a particular community eventually if they know samples can be found there.
Kind of like how filehosts are all disabling their file-sharing functionality almost everyday and people just keep looking for new file-hosts.

I will be on P*C for samples.

Another think its, post copyrighted material of games its violation, but talk and expend guides abouth how open and decrypt and keep out protected material (packed files) u think FBI dont see this wrong too, then without guides, files, links, where its the party.

No you're basically suggesting "let us post samples, or no reverse engineering at all"
Copyright laws are clear; reverse engineering on the other hand are probably still in the grey zone.

Reverse engineering anything on your own, for whatever purpose, is perfectly legal, when you share the methods and tools for reverse engineering you are breaking copyright laws in most western countries. 
Basically anything you do that costs or prevents sales of/in related material is a violation of copyright. Even making a script that decodes a file format breaches copyright law since you are preventing the designer of the format from making their own tools and selling them.

We all know what this hobby is and the risks involved and most know what's going to happen to this forum, all we're saying is that it will in all probability die without easily accessible sample files.

You get the point   , i cant tell to Mr. Adult, He Mr. Adults download Final Fantasy  XIV (22gb game size) or He Mr. Adults download Tera (25gb game size) to see something file format, also i cant tell he, He Mr. Adults y put the links of samples in other forums download from there. (competence of xentax forums), i love Xentax its like my home since years ago, i donate by MultiHex comander only to help but i never use them, and i can donate every time the forum need this help coz this its my home, i understand the position of Mr. Mouse its a riks play with copyrighted material, the think i tell its we need another way to send the sample files to the comunity.

I have only touched games which I own and mostly because I was just curious about the format. 

Judging by all these prophecies concerning Xentax's doom, I must be the only one who left his crystal ball in the dishwasher.
If shit happens, shit happens. Lets just roll with it.
On the bright side, you will have plenty of time to RE the pseudo-English posts in this forum.

Where is the file format issue in that lawsuit? 
It's about emulation and advertising infringements.
[http://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-9th-circuit/1281580.html](http://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-9th-circuit/1281580.html)

But it does bring up a good point, 'fair use' and 'fan art'.
Wouldn't limited 3D model samples come under fair use? (You could even clusterf#ck the textures to make them unusable for other purposes)
[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_use](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_use)

Commentary and criticism, of the 3D model formats we look at, might be something to run with.
As for research and teaching, well that's what this forum is about?

Restricting links to include only those that moderators have the delete code for would be alot better than NO links at all, that way your limiting the distribution to research instead of permanently pinning the files for general distribution. 24 hours to PM the delete code or it's removed.
And you can always delete the link/ (or better) the upload after a set period.

Don't like cherry picking copyright law, either abide by it, ignore it, or find a damn good clause.

Are you just trolling or what? You don't see the relation between software that emulates an entire system and interprets all of its game content while performing highlevel emulation to display and enhance that content, and a script that interprets game content? Bleem! won in every case that went to court with Sony and set an important legal precedence in doing so. Likewise in the case of Connectix Virtual Gamestation, Sony won on a certain important count. (though even still it was a relatively small victory in the case) Because unlike Bleem!, rather than reverse engineering and re-implementing the system software (again it was openly expressed that reverse engineering was used to determine the original workings of the PSX and its BIOS, and the court still ruled in favor of Bleem!), CVG included the actual Sony-owned BIOS image. But apparently this was corrected at some point, with the inclusion of a new BIOS based on reverse engineering. Perhaps you can see the parallels here now, hm? In fact, every court case over emulators (even back to the 1980's) using reverse engineering to determine the workings of systems and software has been ruled in favor of the emulator, the only time the courts have ruled against emulation is when the emulator has included actual proprietary copyrighted binary which is distinctly different from writing new software based on findings from reverse engineering. We have a great many reasons to feel safe in writing scripts and programs to decode game content as long as we do not distribute that content.

Sounds to me like you're just trying to back your desire to see this forum embrace illegal practices by trying to shit on our otherwise legitimate practices and goals.

...Ok Say I download a demo off XBOXLIVE.. is it ok to post the files from that demo?

and if so? who's to say if the files I posted are from a demo or not from a demo..? 

seems to me there should be a halt on hacking altogether, as it will always fall into a grey area no matter how well you paint that picture

Ok asume gray area its ok, but this not solve the original question, i downloaded a game, big game like Conan (30GB), and i want the experts here in Xextax take a view of one file format on this game (.Xor 32kb), i shure nobody agree to download this 30GB only to take a view of 32kb file. where i can upload the sample file? where i can post? and how i can send the samples to all the comunity experts? PM to each Xentax member its not allowed coz its a crazy idea, then that its i want know.

It's no wonder someone googlefucked you with that attitude.
I must be a troll if I have a different view to your own on what is and what isn't legal use of copyrighted material.
As for legitimate practices and goals, your kidding me right? You've been happily collecting money from the 'illegal' practices for all these years and suddenly your cleaning up your act now the income has stopped.....
Your going to have to remove the game archive section based on what you think is correct.

Your not improving or transforming (in a positive way) the material used in any way shape or form, everything is a derivative, it violates copyright law, you just don't understand that.
Explain how what your doing isn't a derivative work? 
What are you doing to improve anything? NOTHING - it violates copyright law.

Feel safe all you want 'just writing scripts', without quoting content your screwed anyway, as more than one person has pointed out.
Basing the 'legitimacy' of the site on your warped view of copyright law just shows you haven't the balls to run a site like this, we're moving on to the next forum, hopefully not run by a 'Canadian'. (forum died)
Xentax a forum for 'toolz' - LOL 

Hillary Clinton said 'BOO' and you shit yourself.

btw, that was a troll, if you don't like it - shove it.

Me? I have nothing to do with Xentax ad revenue or really anything else at Xentax, I simply hold moderator status which means I can ban you or fuck with your posts, and that's about it. I also don't make any money or have any expenses (other than my own time) regarding Noesis. Don't confuse my personal views on your stupidity with those of other members of the Xentax community. They may or may not see your feeble subversion as I do.

I'm gonna ask this:

Why were all the tools links from doa thread deleted if there were no games files??

It doesn't represent a problem to me, I have those tools backed up since 5 or 6 years, but wasn't it going too far??

Like Mr.Mouse mentioned, the script run to remove file links had the potential to also accidentally remove tool links and such. Also as Mr.Mouse mentioned, let him know where that has happened and he can restore the links.

i don't think xentax will die; we have no real other place to go. we really don't belong on the other forums. ever see XXXX's YYYY thread (if you've seen the thread you know who i'm talking about lol)? it went something like this  at least this is how i interpreted it. i don't feel like i belong on the other forums.

XXXX: here, i give you tools and a screenshot of the models you want in 3DS Max.
YYYY: where are the models?
XXXX: extract them yourself.
YYYY: fuck you.
XXXX: i give you tools.
YYYY: fuck you, give me models.
XXXX: i give you tools.
YYYY: fuck you, stop teasing me with screen shots.
XXXX: stop acting like a 12-year old.
