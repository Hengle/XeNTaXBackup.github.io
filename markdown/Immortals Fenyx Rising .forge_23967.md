I know this isnt right but i was looking for away to unpack this game. I see it has the header "scimitar" and I tried using the script on the files but it turned up nothing but some raw data. Looking at it here in Archive Next I see it does read the names like the output files in the script but still cant parse the data. Is there any chance this could be modified to work. Seems like its not encrypted just  not being properly read. I am known to be wrong about this though.

These files work with errors but the others in red fail entirely. Even the 1st one up top which i know sucks but i did upload for research along with a .forge that could read kinda with the scimitar script and Archive Next. The main ones seem to be 1GB to 3GB in size and all these small ones do have LOD0 in them but not sure if the others can be read the same. Any help is appreciated. I hope it is a title we are able to archive. 

Thank you.
