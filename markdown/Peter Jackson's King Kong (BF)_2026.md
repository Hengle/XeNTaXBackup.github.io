Some X360 tools a few have source code. Probably won't work on another platform. You'd probably need to upload a sample and have someone compare.

Seems  parts of ? .bin files are LZO compressed (gotta love that  ) Not sure about other platforms. With LZO data it is best to look at the tail to see if it is compressed. Usually 11 00 is a good sign.

Here are some links (they might not work for Xbox, PS2, PC (if this game is on these platforms))
