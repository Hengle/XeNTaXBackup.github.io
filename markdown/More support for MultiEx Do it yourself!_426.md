- Post Title: More support for MultiEx? Do it yourself!

Look, the amount of time that went into this program is enormous. 
Please do realise that this has been done in my free time, as part of my hobby, and that I have never ever recieved any payment whatsoever for anything even remotely related to this tool that all of you use. 

No payment is ok, I don't mind that, it's a hobby right? 
What I do mind is people asking me : "please support this or that game". 
The brilliant thing of my program is that I created the ability for the user to add additional support themselves using the scripteditor Mex3Scriptor. 
I suggest you read the docs and start doing it yourselves. Get a good hex editor and open the game archives of your choice and find out the format. 

With the release of MultiEx.DLL even coders can implement MultiEx functionality in their own game editors, without the need for MultiEx Commander to intervene. 

What more do you want? 

I'm not saying I will not ever support any new formats, I am saying time is money, and time coding on MC or puzzling out formats is a burden on my social life. My social life has priority. Thus, you're left with a tool that has got everything for you, you should just work out the formats and write the scripts. If you don't want to do that, fine, but don't come running to me, allright?

I will post here the emails I get of "supportrequests". Perhaps some other fool just like me mioht know the answer.

 message Dear makers of MultiEx.
First I want to thank you for making this tool.So many awesome bits of media are put into a game, and after playing the game, you think, that sound was perfect, I want to put that into my startup.Then you can't.Well I am doing a project on philosophy, and world media, and in Planescape:Torment, there is a particular phrase which is said by a minor charecter: "What can change the nature of a man?" and I thought, that's perfect for my power point presentation part of the project.Problem is I simply could not find it.Then I found your guys ingenious program which I thought, oh my goodness, these guys are kings.They made all that, and Freeware no less.So first, my hats off to you..but when I open up the file extension looking for usable formats, all I get are 123.mex files.Thousands of them.I have no idea what I am looking for, and when I export those files, they are unusable by any programs.I looked through your help, and screen shots, but in all of those it shows file formate which are usable like wav, ect. wh

Yours truly,
David

This thing is totally cool. Thanks a lot.

By the way, any chance of getting support
for Age of Wonders unitGFX ilb files?
This guy did some work on the format.
I can't do a thing with it but it might be useful to
someone like you.

Hello, I am new but I just have to say this after reading this thread.

I feel bad for you.      You made a cool program and alot of people appreciate it, but obviously they want their game to be supported.  Well why do they come crying to you about it?  Maybe you should take your email address off the site or something.  You don't have time for that.

Actually its a good thing I found this thread too, cause I was about to post about a request myself.  Yeah yeah, go ahead and laugh at the noob.     

But seriously, this program sounds great, but.... I am looking for a user friendly way to get the dialog files from Metal Gear Solid 2 PC.  The files are .dat format and nothing I try can open it.  I suppose if you have a step by step guide on how to script or whatever I could try, but it sounds really, uh, for programmers.  I am a smart person and all, but scripting/coding/hacking whatever, I have NO IDEA what that code is about, and it confuses me.  I don't want to have to download a hex editor, but I may already have one, cause a console game needed it to convert its save file or something.  I followed those directions and were easy, but I am afraid this is even heavier stuff.

So what do you recommend?  What should I do?

Well, the only thing I can say is that you should familiarize yourself with Hex Workshop despite that you don't want to and figure out the format if possible. Please read the old multiex2 (16-bit, DOS) document on how its script works, it will also tell you a little bit about how some formats work. You can read it from within Mex3Scriptor, the script program that comes with MultiEx Commander.

Hmm.... heavy stuff.  I could try that.  I don't have the time right now.  Still, I thank you for making this program.  Because with this program, even if it doesn't support games it can be made to.  So if I really don't want to download all these programs, learn scripting, etc, maybe I can find someone who is willing to do it (people who go to my college who are game programmers).

Thanks anyway.  I hope I can do this someday soon.

Hi again.  

So i hope you can get me going a little further (in my thread).  Because I don't even know if I understand the documents or how to start.  but my friend may be well on the way to doing it, he came across an 'error 9' though.

But, I want to know, if anyone adds new game support for MultiEx, should we email you the script so that you can add that to the next update of MultiEx?

Yes you can email it, and also you can add it yourself if you join the open source project MexCom. As you may or may not know, MultiEx Commander is now open source. After the release of 3.9.68, I have set it up as open source :
[http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/mexcom](http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/mexcom)

In your case, I don't think you will start programming on it, so if you come across a script just email that to me, or post it here!! Thanks!
