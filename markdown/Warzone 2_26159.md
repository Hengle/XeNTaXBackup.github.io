Is there any game file extraction tool for WZ2 yet?

The main files should be .xsub files, some of them are encrypted 
WZ1 extractor doesn't work - bc it's a IW 9 not IW 8 engine game
There are a few scripts, everything u'll be able to extract with those is linked down below

Another way to extract the map would be to get a 3d modell from Al Mazrah. Only problem there: Google earth 3d data is to bad

Hello, I saw that you mentioned that there are some scripts that could work with warzone 2, can you link them?
I want to extract some icons from the game, but didn't found something that might work with the game files.
