- Post Title: Ratchet & Clank FFA/ITN .dat files

Yo, I'm trying to find a way to extract the .dat files from Ratchet & Clank Full Frontal Assault and Into the Nexus. I want to try some model swaps between the games, since they are on the same engine, play and look the exact same (down to animations even). 

My thought process is to try and see if dragging and dropping models from one game to the other would work and if not, figure out a way around it. However my main issue is that I cant find a way to extract the .dat files within the level_cached.psarc files within the game, the main .dat I want to try and extract is the textures one and the moby one but they come out as 0kb (dunno if theres actual data in there but there should be) and I cant seem to find a tool that would allow me to extract and repack these .dat files.

If anyone knows or can help me out it would be a godsend 'cause I'm racking my mind here.
