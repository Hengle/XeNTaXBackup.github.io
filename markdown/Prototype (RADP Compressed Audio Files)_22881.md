- Post Title: Prototype (RADP Compressed Audio Files)

I recently found a way to convert .radp files from Prototype game with a tool called radp2wav.

Unfortunately that tool can convert only one file at the time. 

Fortunately the .rar file attachment contains the source code in Visual Basic so if an skilled coder among us
could find a way to add the method for multiple file handling it would be a big help for everyone.
