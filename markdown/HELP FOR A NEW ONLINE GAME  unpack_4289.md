you can get the files without names like this.
just use offzip
offzip.exe -a -z -15 C:\Downloads\agdata1.pak "C:\Downloads\New folder" 0x0

its a modified zip format with the central directory compressed too - but that's extracted by offzip at the last block (see 00c8f11c.dat)

i noticed 26 spare bytes from the last file to the file size, which looks like the eocd and perhaps a pointer to the compressed central directory, but i failed to get anywhere else. (i just saw 05 06 as part of the eocd signature)

anyway. we can botch extracting these files with filenames 

1) in a hex editor, copy the contents of 00c8f11c.dat at the start of agdata1.pak and run this bms:

```
#  workaround bms

comtype deflate

for i = 0

  idstring "PK\x01\x02"

  savepos SKIP
  math SKIP += 16
  goto SKIP
  
  get ZSIZE long
  get SIZE long
  get NLEN short
  get ELEN short
  get CLEN short

  savepos SKIP
  math SKIP += 8
  goto SKIP

  get OFFSET long
  math OFFSET += 56516 ## size of our temp header

  getdstring NAME NLEN

  savepos SKIP
  math SKIP += ELEN
  math SKIP += CLEN
  goto SKIP


  if SIZE > 0

    if ZSIZE == SIZE

      log NAME OFFSET SIZE

    else

      clog NAME OFFSET ZSIZE SIZE

    endif

  endif


next i

```
