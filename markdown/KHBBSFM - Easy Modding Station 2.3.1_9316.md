Hi,
here's an Easy Modding program I made to apply currently existing mods as you like
It patches BBS0-1-3.DAT files : BBS0 for cutscenes, BBS1 for In Game features, BBS3 for additionnal features (like Reports)
Or simply the entire Iso directly

Actually, one time (two weeks ago?) I checked your thread to see if anything was updated and your thread was gone! Not only that but almost all thread on that forum was gone too!

It was temporary but I took that as a sign that something bad was going to happen.

Yeah, everyone would be all over modding KH3D if the 3DS encryption wasn't so impossibly impenetrable. I'll still be interested in BBSFM mods for a long while until such time as KH3 or the HD remake come out. By the way, I assume the HD remake will be 1.5 for PS3, but we'll just have to wait to be sure what they do next.

I think this is better than 1.2 and 1.3, because the colors are her natural blue, but the nipples on 1.4 are a solid color and aren't two-colored like that of 1.1. The 1.1 nipples were a circle inside of another circle, which made them more realistic. If you put that aspect of 1.1 into your new mods, I'd probably start using them.

Here is a picture to illustrate my point:

Not sure if this counts as a necro, though - A while ago I did sort of an "update" to this mod. I revamped the breast and pelvic region to be a bit smoother

This one looks more realistic than the others. I'll try it the next time I play the game.

I started this modding project knowing that this one was very special, and indeed it is, through all 5 versions of this mod, we had over 2,000 downloads of it, and its impressive to see how far its come from the original one I've created, it looks so good:)

Interesting mods. It took me a few days to download them all, because that uploaded site makes you wait at least 180 minutes between downloads.
