I'm asking if you have this same file but in another language coz comparing is the best way to reverse engineer a file structure.

This is a standard format of games developed by Cauldron, also used in games like "Civil War - Secret Missions" and "Gene Troopers".

The following are the files of their games for comparison. Currently I'm trying to translate the game Civil War - Secret Missions, if anyone can help thank you.

The format is not that easy but I'm close...I'll write down some documentation once is done

Anyway, different languages from the same game would be useful

Unfortunately all Cauldron games I found are in English only. Sorry.

I'm writing a dumper in Visual Studio 2010. When it's ready I'll attach tool and project mainly because I don't know if I'll write the reinserter too. I'm writing many comments so it'd be easy to make your own inserter
