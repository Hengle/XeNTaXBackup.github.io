- Post Title: Some compressed data from GameCube game

I've recently stumbled upon archive from racing game for GameCube.
Basically the entire archive contents are compressed as a single chunk of data.
I wasn't able to detect algo, but it looks like some form of LZ.
Maybe someone seen something similar or same?

Fields:
0x78 Compressed size
0x7C Uncompressed size
0x80 Data start
