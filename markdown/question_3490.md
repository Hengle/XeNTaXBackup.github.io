Are you able to extract those files?
Those files are close to wii models.
you would have to upload the extracted models for someone to look at.

I have uploaded some files in my first post, that's as far as I could go to extract stuff... the file format (mpk,i3r,seq etc.) I was not able to open.

so mpk is the motion package (animations)
i3r is the 3d model
so if chroxx can help me on it i think we could manage to do a generic psp viewer, it seems all psp games use the same 3d model format !

I apologize for necroing the thread but this seems the closest to ripping models from PSP games that I'm aware of. Has any of this been successful or is there a sure fire way to ripping from PSP games?

Please, you've gotta take a look at it.
i3r format for Blood+: Sōyoku no Battle Rondo PS2 is very similar to Bleach heat the soul PSP.

If I recall correctly the model he posted a screenshot of is from Bleach Heat the Soul 7 not 6, as 7 had GMO models and not the i3r format. Though many games do use this format including Project Diva I do not believe anyone has made a easy to use viewer/converter. Either way it probably would have been better to pm him instead of reviving this old dead thread.
