- Post Title: Survarium maps

Hi, I was wondering if someone could help me please. I want to get coordinates for all objects from Survarium's maps (to import map to 3ds max).
I attached some files .If you need exe file, i can send you via pm.
Also this is a little bit of a structure(found by myself) :

```
char header[20]
int32 version
char unknown[32]
int32 offset to list of objects
int32 always1 (always 00 00 00 00)
int32 always2 (always 19 CE 39 AA)
```
