- Post Title: DragonBall Kai Ultimate Butouden Models?

I've used rom extractors to extract the files from this game and there's no models folder. I've also tried opening all of the bin files in the rom but I still can't find any models. So basically what I'm asking is, how on Earth am I supposed to rip models from this game? Out of all of the models in this game the only ones I want are Goku (preferably in his normal form) and Vegeta in his Buu saga outfit (also normal form). I've noticed over the years that the developers of DragonBall Z games never seem to use the same file formats as other games that share the same console. Which gets really annoying when ripping models from DBZ games because there are never any programs for ripping DBZ models. I ran into the same problem when trying to rip DragonBall Z Budokai 3 models, but of course the model files were completely different than the ones used in every other PS2 game. I guess developers do it so people won't steal their models, but it gets really annoying when you don't plan on using the models for profit. I'm planning on using these models to make Garry's Mod playermodels, I actually know how to make playermodels for Source, but I always have to use already ripped models, because the ones I want haven't been ripped and look like they never will be ripped.
