- Post Title: Re-Volt 2 .z files

I'm trying to get the bmp out of this. I'm trying to get the car "FROZEN" from RV2. As far as I know, RV2 ran on the same engine as the original Re-Volt. I've got the PRMs and the parameters, now I'm trying to get the bmps out of these Z files. Can anybody help?

It is just headerless BMP compressed with ZLIB.
You can use offzip and texturefinder to convert it to BMP.

```
offzip.exe -a CarSkin0.bmp.z out
```

this script will read the header and decompress
and parse the image data on the fly.

Only works with the files you uploaded
Too lazy to upload the files for the other cars, so you will have to find the game files online
