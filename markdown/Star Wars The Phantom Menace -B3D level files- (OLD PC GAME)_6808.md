Using the Blitz3D demo, i replaced one of the sample B3D files with one of these from SWTPM and tried to load it to no avail, however it came back with a Blitz3D error saying something about "no entity", so maybe the format is similar but it doesnt see a playerspawn node?

I've found a B3D importer for max from this site but its only for 3ds max 5 and 6, and while I have an old version of 3ds max 6 laying around, its incompatible with windows vista and 7, even with compatibility settings selected. I'm still not sure if this game is actualy Blitz3D but I figured I would use it as a basis for testing. If anyone has any imput it would be greatly appreciated
