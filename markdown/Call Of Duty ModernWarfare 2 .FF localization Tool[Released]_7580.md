- Post Title: Call Of Duty ModernWarfare 2 .FF localization Tool[Released]

Hi all, "Chronic" created MW2 .ff tool. 

http://www.multiupload.com/F3RTA26252

Required Information in "read_me.txt".


What can it do?

-It can extract localization files(subtitles,menu texts...)

What can't it do?

-No import.

Chronic did tried to make injector tool, but he couldn't achieve it, and he doesn't want to work on it anymore. So, is there anybody else thinks that he/she can achieve it??

Because of the way .ff files work, you would need to know how every single asset in the file is structured to extract them correctly. I also tried making one and gave up because of this.
