That's right. This topic will be moved when you reply here again, so you'll have read this message and know that it will be moved to the Game Request forum. 

Freelancer is already supported in MexCom, I suppose you mean other file types than the one supported, eh?  

Can you tell us which exactly? And what it is that you request? Your english is fine  So, which files need to be investigated? The FLM files are your basic Zip format. What other file do you mean?
