platform: PSV
GAME TITLE: tales of heart R
[tohr.rar](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/jfnt028c2iy3p6e/AAA3ApLyuD_jOUJfz7o2_Ylza?dl=0)


I don't know what compressed method, I tried zlib, but error occured!

Here are some file extension with  TGA
I can't preview them with popular tools.
I'm sure they're image data, maybe compressed.
so if anyone help me？
I have no idea about compressed image!
Any help will be greatly appreciated!

Thank you chrrox.
I've tried this tool before,  but after extracting，  .tga file  still can't show well.

All of *.tga, but *.tga in Status folder, are also the same problem
is it channel or other problem?
What i shoud do?
Thank you first of all !

Try swapping the endian of the tga. Or try loading it with a different tool might just be your viewer.
