- Post Title: Borderlands 2 Font upgrade

I've been working on the Borderlands 2 translation /Hungarian by the ways/ for a while, and came across a quite big problem. The original ingame font (Compacta Bd BT) does not support a few national characters (ű and ő). I want a solution for this problem if anyone has one. I've searched forums, emailed support sites and tried fixing it myself. I failed on all front, but I haven't fully given up. I think someone over here can help me, and I hope they will. Otherwise I have to use ü and ö which is possible, but I want the whole 9 yards if I started a this humongous project. At least make something I can pass on the one who continues my work if I give up.
