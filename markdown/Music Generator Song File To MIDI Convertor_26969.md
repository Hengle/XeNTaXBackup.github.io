- Post Title: Music Generator Song File To MIDI Convertor?

This is only a concept; it would be great to have a tool that reads .psu files from the Music series, locates where the song data is, and then converts it to MIDI.

There is a program that does this already for certain trackers called Awave Studio, but when I enquired about this the dev said that, "Unfortunately the MG2 project files seems a bit too complicated to make much sense of without a documentation of the format."

I have attached some song files if anyone fancies having a look...



PS: MG2 means MTV Music Generator 2.

Here's a bunch of MIDI type files. Hopefully someone will figure out what format they used...
