I don't know if these files are compressed...
But If you want to translate or edit the graphic you should use an hex editor, tim extractor and a tool to search text if it's not in standard ascii... 

File extension are useless... The content of file is important...

PSx normally uses 2 kind of image:

Classic TIM
RAW TIM (Standard TIM without header)

Try PSicture -> [http://www.zophar.net/utilities/psxutil/psicture.html](http://www.zophar.net/utilities/psxutil/psicture.html)
Or TIM Viewer -> [http://www.zophar.net/utilities/psxutil/tim-viewer.html](http://www.zophar.net/utilities/psxutil/tim-viewer.html)

Or any other tool you can find in this website...

For psx audio file, they can be extracted...
For all other files you need something customized...

Good Luck...
