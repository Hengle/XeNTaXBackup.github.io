- Post Title: Requesting help with GitS Online sounds, .FSB

I've tried a few different things without any luck, so any help would be appreciated.
Using fsbext, it seems the files are encrypted, and if that is the case, the passkey doesn't seem to be making itself obvious. Aezay's FSB extractor is reporting an unknown version. FMOD's event player can access the archives and sort through them, but nothing is playable.
