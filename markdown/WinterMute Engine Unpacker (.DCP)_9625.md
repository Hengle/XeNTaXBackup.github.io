NAME: DCP Unpacker
VERSION: 1.0.1
AUTHOR: Vash
CATEGORY: Unpacker
PLATFORM: PC
UPLOAD DATE: June 24, 2013
FILESIZE: 78kb
DESCRIPTION:
This tool allow you to unpack every *.DCP
GAMES SUPPORTED: [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wintermute ... Wintermute](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wintermute_Engine#Games_developed_with_Wintermute) (incomplete)
DOWNLOAD PAGE: [http://www.mediafire.com/download.php?rard7tih3dwmqjf](http://www.mediafire.com/download.php?rard7tih3dwmqjf)


I know, the GOBREAD already extracts these archives but that tool is a pain in the ass, doesn't work on x64, doesn't work if the path is too long and so on...this works like a charm (and it's faster  )

Requires VC++ 2010 libraries (who doesn't have those installed nowadays?   )
[UPDATE]
Now it requires VC++ 2012 libraries, I'm sorry but I work with that and I don't have the 2010 installed anymore

bye
