How did you rip the relevant files, then?

Not sure what complete refers to, but try Blender.
Or if you want to load multiple parts/objects try in batch mode for Noesis.

If the files are in the .dz format, how'd you get it to work with the program?

The problem is I can't open g1t and g1m directly in Noesis.

The Quick BMS script or the Noesis plugin?

Extract .dz with the bms script first. Drag the file to ffsnt.

Where did you get the files again? Extract the apk with winrar?

The BMS Script seems to look for an ID of GT1G0600 at 0x00. Which most of the .dz files I checked don't have.

files ending with dz contain zlib compressed data and have nothing to do with my scripts.   
you can use offzip to extract the contents of those quickly and easily.

And where do I find this offzip thing? And how do I use it?

On another note, the game has a 'Batch Download' option to for all their updates. Does this mean the model files are not in the APK, but somewhere else? If so, where do I get them?

You need a rooted phone or emulator with root mode to access the downloaded files, they will usually be in the main Android folder, in the dissidia data folder
