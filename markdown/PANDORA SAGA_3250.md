Hi!

Another game to see if something is rippable.

Here is a .dat file from CHAR folder. In one folder there are these files:

0000.dat
0001.dat
0002.dat
0003.dat

All of them are decending in size. I took the smallest one.

Here are some screens of models:





Here is the archive:

Unfortunatly this file it is detached from the context. Is there a demo-download-link?

nah, no demo and the download is on a japanese site. The setup is 64mb and then it starts to download files.

Your given link forwards to an FTP-server with this address:
[ftp://groftp.nefficient.jp/pub/groftp/p ... ga/client/](ftp://groftp.nefficient.jp/pub/groftp/pandorasaga/client/)
Rummage around there...

No, not yet. I'm a little busy at the moment and therefore I finished only some simpler tasks like speed-improvements in my program GOBREAD.

Edit: I downloaded the 65MB-file from the FTP-link. Waste of time. It only copies an .EXE somewhere and tries to install a japanese(?) version of Direct-X.
