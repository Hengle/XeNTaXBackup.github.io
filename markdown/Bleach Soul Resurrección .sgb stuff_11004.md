- Post Title: Bleach: Soul Resurrecci√≥n *.sgb stuff

I wanted to change the background music used in this game with the anime original ones, so I began to "research" this *.sgb format. It has to be an *.AC3 file, I'm able to convert it with VLC Player, but when I convert it back to *.AC3 with Sony Sound Forge 9.0, the file don't work anymore, no BGM in-game. This Bleach game uses only one *.sgb file for it's bgm data, didn't find any *.sgh file whatsoever. When opened, this bgm.sgb contains every background music, so without an *.sgh, it's up to the game to determine when to loop? Maybe it's something coded inside of it's EBOOT.BIN.
Anyway, I would like to find a way to convert something like a *.wav back to *.sgb. Can you provide some help, some lead? Thank you.
