- Post Title: Dead or Alive - Ultimate Asistance

I just recently came across a community from the formal ninjahacker site, who enjoy modding DOA games. they've got as far as extracting raw textures and 3ds models.

keep in mind this game is for xbox, and runs off a *.xbe, simular to a *.exe.. all the files in the game are kept in a archive. with the ext. *.asf ...

this format has been pretty much mastered. with apps like [ASFExplorer](http://fifasoccer.ru/files/?download=41)

our problem is we can't add new models in the game, with out expanding the asf file. this then causes the game to glitch and not function. we expect that the game either has some special table, telling the game where to locate each file in side the asf archive. or the main xbe, contains this special table. where not sure how to go about it as this type of asf was heavly encryted by its developers...

and atop that after we are able expand the asf, while enabling the games to pickup these files. we also need help expand another format found inside the asf, a xpr. which is another common model file.. but too is encryted.

basically what i'm asking for is if anyone is interested in helping us code a expansion/injection tool for DOAU, plz visit [The HiveQ Forum](http://wp326.boardsxp.com/index.php) we have about 5 other coders there, but the speed of the project is going at a snails pace. 

if proper file injection can be made, its possible, to make a mugun like game out of tecmo's doau. having the ability to add different 3d models and such..

heres what we've gotten to soo far... and its just some skin replacement atm...

Well, we would need to have examples of those files and possibly other files that contain the tables that point to where a file can be found in the .asf files. 

Is this possible to arrange? Also, what is this encryption, it was figured out already?
