Does anyone know of any good xmodel extractors or importers? Unfortunately Tom Crowley's Lime, while incredibly useful, doesn't support COD 5 and below.

I did find an xmodel exporter, but the author's site had been shut down and the program is horribly buggy. Plus the included Maya scripts are broken, rendering it impossible to get anything decent.

Oh hey, I didn't see that. 

Yeah, that works just fine. The models export successfully and the bind script actually does it's job. Now I just got to figure out how the heck to export it from Maya, but that's a different story. 

Anyway, thanks!

New problem. xmodelutils is great tool, but like luxox said it only supports COD 4/5/7. What about other COD games?

The only other xmodel tool I've found is the utterly broken one I mentioned earlier.
