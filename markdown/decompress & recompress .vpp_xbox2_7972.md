name of the game?
is this file complete or only a part?

in my opinion it's only a part because there are offsets bigger than the file size

im pretty sure that file is complete....a guy named rick 'gibbed' coded a program that can unpack these files; the problem is packing them back together right is the problem

Rick provides also a packer application so why you open a new thread here wasting our time for something that already exists instead of contacting the original developer first???
he has written the tools and he is the best person who can solve the compatibility problems.
