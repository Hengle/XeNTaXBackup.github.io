- Post Title: Extraction of KKND sprites

I would like to extract the sprites from KKND, there's some previous work done here: [http://www.sleipnirstuff.com/forum/view ... 83&t=15158](http://www.sleipnirstuff.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=83&t=15158) (the download link in that page includes the original files so I'm not reposting them here). I'm pretty new to this reverse engineering thingy, so if anyone could at least point me out to tools or describe the file format this would be very welcome.

Thanks.

did you contact the author of that thread? this project sounds ambitious but he may have done more work since his last post

Yes I did, no answer so far, looks like he disappeared. I really want to extract the sprites from the files. It doesn't look that hard but I lack the proper tools and experience.
