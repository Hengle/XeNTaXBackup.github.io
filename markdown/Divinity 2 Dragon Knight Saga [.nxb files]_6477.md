Hi, guys. i want to check out all the items' code of this game.
then i can get whatever i want in the game with Content_Unlocker.xml
the Unlocker script is:
<root>
   <UnlockedContent>
      <Entry>3841c59c-527d-40d5-959e-51502688542e</Entry>

when we put this Unlocker file in xxx\Divinity II - DKS\data
we can get the item between the two <Entry>

so i need to unpack the .dv2 files to check out all the item's code.
but when i unpack them ,i found there are other formats need to be unpacked...
for instance, when i unpacked itemphysx.dv2 (thanks to bacter), i got .nxb

so could anyone give me another script to unpack it? 
or i have to study QuickBMS to write a script by myself.
i know chrrox  had written a tutorial about it, but it's still very difficult to me..

Thanks in advance. and sorry for my english
