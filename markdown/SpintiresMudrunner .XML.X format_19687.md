- Post Title: Spintires/Mudrunner .XML/.X format

Since I'm considering to convert tons of cars from many various games such as Spintires for example to Assetto Corsa soon, I want to know on how to properly extract 3D models and textures of its vehicles (especially mod ones) from their .XML files and convert their .X files to .FBX format needed for AC.

Now I already read a previous topic about that game here, where someone used the program called 'hex2obj' to showcase that it's somewhat possible to do, but that program is a bit complicated to me, so I would like to know if there's perhaps an easier alternative to that program or if that program is the only one to do so currently.

It sucks how this thread has no replies, cause I am looking for this answer too. I found this program called Spintires Editor, but you can't seem to get it anymore.
