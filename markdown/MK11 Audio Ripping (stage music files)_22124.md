- Post Title: MK11 Audio Ripping (stage music files)

Hi Guys,

Need some help with MK11 Music files. I have already used the method that Shokoniraya (decompressor script) & Luriam (ravioli game tools) to rip the music found in 

SND_MUS_*****

But, there are stage music tracks, I believe the reside in BGND_BlackDragonFightClub.xxx (for Black Dragon Fight Club stage), There was also a .PSF file for some Krypt music that was outside of the .xxx archive. I believe that BGND_BlackDragonFightClub.xxx has a .psf file inside the archive containing the music. When you scan it with Ravioli, it only finds the top level .wav/ogg ambiance files. Can some one take a look? 

I used to use Gildor's extract / decompressor tool to dump the whole contents of an .xxx archive, then rip the .fsb's once they were extracted. but it hasn't been updated for MK11.
