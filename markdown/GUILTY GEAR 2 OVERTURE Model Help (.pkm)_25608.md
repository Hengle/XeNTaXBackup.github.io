Hello everyone! This is something me and some friends have been trying to wrap our brain around for a long time.

Essentially, we are trying to figure out how to extract files (specifically, rigged character models with their textures) from the game. Ninjaripper works, but we're trying to find the original, rigged and t-posed models rather than a direct, posed and unskinned rip. 

The game seems to use .pkm files to pack and archive files, and I've had difficulty getting anything out of these; Ravioli tools just gives me a few scattered DDS textures for environments. It's difficult to find anything about .pkm file type archives, since research just leads to nothing but Pokemon related stuff.

Specifically, I am attempting to extract from the PC version. Anything helps!

Bump. I wanna mention that from looking on this forum, some games seem to use .PKM as a texture format. In this case, I believe .PKM is being used as a container, given that some contain multiple .DDS files and some not at all.

So far, nothing. The only thing I've been able to find is scattered environment textures and UI elements. Still no models! 

I did find a mention of model tools for the game on Xenhax, however the post is from 2016 and the link to the game tools is dead. I'll try and get into contact with the author, but they don't seem active and there's a fair chance they don't have the tools anymore. I'll update if I find anything.

Sweet! And sorry if this is a dumb question, I'm new to this whole thing; what program are you using to view the .AFB there?

Alright, thanks! I'll be honest, I don't understand any of this hex editor and technical stuff-- but I'm committed, and willing to learn!   

Will post updates (once I teach myself about hexadecimal) if I manage to get the models working.

In the mean time, I'll drop a ZIP with some PKMs I was unable to get any model data out of (the only ones I was actually able to extract 3D data from were the ones named "MODEL" in the level folders, which seem to only contain environment and area stuff from my knowlegde). I was able to get quite a bit of textures out of them, including textures for characters/enemies and effects. If anyone can take a look that would be great-- I'm not sure if there really is any model data in these files, but it's the closest thing I can find that has the characters so far.

Any news on the PKMs? 

I've managed to get virtually every texture in the game so far thanks to Ravioli Game Tools, buuut still can't get any models outside the levels folder.

you say that you will study.
I thought you would do it yourself.   

models are in files whose names start with AF**.PKM, 
textures in files whose names start with TD**.PKM
i update unpacker.(click on arrow) will unpack .abf files

(since you have already received the textures, I did not unpack them)

Thanks for the help! I've exported and sorted all the characters now-- However, we have the new issue of no rigs or UVs.

We can live without rigs, the models are simple enough for us to rig from scratch-- however, no UVs puts a bit of a roadblock in our project. Is it possible to get UV data from the AFB files?

I know it's been awhile, you may not see this but if you do would you be able to help us with how you got the Rigs and UVs? Thank you for all the help so far.
