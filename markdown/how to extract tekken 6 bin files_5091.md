Those files are supposed to get bigger after you decompress them with the poopypants.exe.
Read the whole Tekken 6 thread, everything is explained in it!

I didnt decompressed it in poopypants, I decompressed them in xbdecompress. I dont know what to do next because when I run poopypants through command promt, it says it cant run the program. What should I do next after I decompressed them in xbdecompress? can someone gave me a clear instruction? I kinda dont get on the tekken 6 thread.

To use, first use xbdecompress to decompress your .bin files, then use the syntax: poopypants.exe file.idx decompressedfile.bin (example: poopypants.exe data301.idx data301.bin).

I dont know but, the command promt cannot execute poopypants. it always says "the system cannot execute the specified program". Should I run it through command promt? or there is something wrong on my computer? poopypants is only 8kb on my computer.

There is something wrong on my pc. Because I tried poopypants on my another pc and it works. Is there a setup I should change in order poopypants to work?

poopypants is a dead-simple win32 console app, no reason for it to not run on just about any win32 machine. Based on your error, it sounds like you simply don't have poopypants.exe in the working directory.
