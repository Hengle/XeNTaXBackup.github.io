- Post Title: HOW they can do it ?

My dream is to do some works that other people doing at [http://garrysmod.org/](http://garrysmod.org/)
but i dont know how they can do such works and with wich tools ?
I downloaded all the tools at [http://nemesis.thewavelength.net/](http://nemesis.thewavelength.net/) and try them on hlfe life 2 episode two and left for dead and the result was these tools can extract 3d models of hlfe life 2 episode two in .obj format
and can only view the models of left for dead and can't extract them .
and milkshape can't decompile these .mdl fils to .smd for animating .
can you guide me ! I hope to appreciate your stately in some ways .

Use xsi mod tool.
[http://www.softimage.com/products/modtool/](http://www.softimage.com/products/modtool/)
you can import and export model files for all the half life games.
Import a character in the game already with the skeleton.
then delete the mesh and just leave the skeleton.
No scale your model to fit the skeleton and just skin your character then export.

finally i succeed to apply mdldecompiler and extract skeleton and 3d models of l4d except for survivors !
please someone reveal for me the trick of decompiling these models (survivors) thanks a lot ?
i placed all the files that i guess related to survivor_teenangst.mdl in one folder but decompiler crashed and in the end only two files (mdldecompiler.qc mdldecompiler_expressions.vta) was generated !
please guide me ?
