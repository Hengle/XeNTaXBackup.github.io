Hey cool! 

EDIT: Erm, where do I find the .BOX signature? I got the full game and non-surprizingly the key for the Demo doesn't work...

it's located in the process so you can get it by:
- searching in the memory with ollydbg
- dumping the process with my dumproc tool or dumpfx or any other process dumper and then searching in the file
very very easy
