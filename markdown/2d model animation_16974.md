- Post Title: 2d model animation

Hello!
I have an asset with 2d model textures and some animation files.
[https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B090yo ... sp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B090yo_BbS1HMnA4bWlFdHpiejA/view?usp=sharing)
I can unpack that asset with Unity Assets Bundle Extractor or UnityAssetsExplorer.
Can I saw how that model looks in idle(C006Idle_AnimationClip) or move(C006Move_AnimationClip)?
Thank You!
