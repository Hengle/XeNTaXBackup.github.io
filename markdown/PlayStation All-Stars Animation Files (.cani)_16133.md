- Post Title: PlayStation All-Stars Animation Files? (*.cani)

I think I put this in the wrong place earlier, so I'll post it here. Is there any info on how to open or use PSASBR's animations? They're in *.cani, which seems to not be understood yet.

It should be noted that both the PS3 and Vita versions of PlayStation All-Stars Battle Royale use *.cani, and I'm pretty sure other games do to. I think in general it's used for Vita games.

So, it's been over a week with no reply, so I'm assuming no one here knows either. Is it possible for someone to make a tool to work with these kinds of files? Can that be done? Do I need to post some of the files as examples?
