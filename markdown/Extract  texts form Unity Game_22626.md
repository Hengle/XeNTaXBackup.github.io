- Post Title: Extract  texts form Unity Game

Hi, I am trying to extract the texts of a game in Unity to be able to create a translation patch, I have already achieved it with several thanks to the uTinyRipper tool, however there is a game that does not show the texts like the others.

Normally it would display the texts like this:

m_Text: Amazing and press the start button!

However in this game they come out like this:

  m_Script: {fileID: 1297475563, guid: f70555f144d8491a825f0804e09c671c, type: 3}

As far as I can see it refers to a separate file or database, but I can't find it.

Any idea how to obtain the texts? 
I really only require the texts in plain text, since to enter them and that the game recognizes them is not a problem.

Maybe try to use Total Commander [https://ikskoks.pl/searching-text-strin ... commander/](https://ikskoks.pl/searching-text-strings-using-total-commander/)

I have already used total commander, the problem is that the texts are not located in any of the files that this program extracts for me, I don't know if unity generates a database or something like that, and that utinyripper cannot extract.

I'm in the same boat, trying to extract text from a Unity game made in Android. Usually I can use apktool and strings / Total Commander to extract the text in the assets/bin/Data directory, but in one game, only the text for the first level is present. Did you guys above have any luck?

I don't know if you've managed to do anything, but I now know how to translate games on android.
Maybe I can help you, I don't guarantee anything.
