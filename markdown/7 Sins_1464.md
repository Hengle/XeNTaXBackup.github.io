Sorry for the late response, have been busy with the new version  Thanks for the file! But could send another file? Say, take the last 2 Mb of the file and zip it and then send it?

Ok, here's a script that might work. I'm not sure, as I don't have the whole archive and some of it is a wild guess. I have reason to suspect the resource offsets are relative rather than absolute, yet perhaps this will be the right format. Try it out on the big PAK file. Also, please do send that 2mb piece from the back of the PAK file. 

```
IDString 0 PACK ;
SavePos TailOffOff 0 ;
Get TailOff Long 0 ;
SavePos TailSizeOff 0 ;
Get TailSize Long 0 ;
Set FileNum Long TailSize ;
Math FileNum /= 80 ;
GoTo TailOff 0 ;
For T = 1 To FileNum ;
GetDString FN 72 0 ;
SavePos FOO 0 ;
Get FO Long 0 ;
SavePos FSO 0 ;
Get FS Long 0 ;
Log FN FO FS FOO FSO ;
Next T ;

```

Yes, if you could do the filecutter again and choose the 1MB size instead of the 512kb size - the directory that we need to analyse is slightly bigger than the 512 that the filecutter copied.

Thanks mate.

No you couldn't, because the tail part is more than 1 MB and I wish to see the beginning of it.

Really? Wow ok, when I analysed the file I thought the directory was like 550kb big. Well in that case, choose the 2MB file cutter option instead

Well, no, what I asked for was the 2 Mb part from the back of the file, not the header. So the TAIL part. I need to see the last 2 Mb part of the file. 

That way I will be able to fix the script for you. Remember, i only guessed based on fragments of what you showed me. 

So please send the last 2 MB of the file.
