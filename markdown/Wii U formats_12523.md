- Post Title: Wii U formats

Wii U hacking/ripping has now gone public, so I would like to request model viewing utilities, or Noesis scripts, for the following two formats, complete with their rigging and everything.

.BFRES, the common model format
.DAT, the format used in Platinum's games (they seem to change up the format every few games or so, but I assume their Wii U games, Wonderful 101 and Bayonetta 2, use a similar format to one another)

All of your help and effort will be hugely appreciated.
