- Post Title: .geom files?

i've been following daemon's tutorial on extracting assets from goldeneye 007: reloaded for the ps3 and i noticed that there's a mysterious file type that i can't seem to find anything about - .geom files. included in the original post ([viewtopic.php?f=16&t=14812&p=121308&hil ... ye#p121308](https://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=14812&p=121308&hilit=goldeneye#p121308)) there's supposed to be a .bms file that opens it, but every time i try and run it through quickbms, i get an error. i can't seem to find any real information on these files online except that they are probably some sort of mesh file(?) 

any help on deciphering these files would be much appreciated!

For GE Reloaded extraction you need this version of quickbms for it to work: [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1n5Wfgk ... sp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1n5Wfgk8HvzyTOa9ZLn09AYYaiewmF5gT/view?usp=sharing)

If it still doesn't work I can probably rip the model you want for you.
