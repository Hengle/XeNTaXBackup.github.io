- Post Title: TIM2/TIM3 file spec

Does anybody still have the specs (or conversion info) from that "radical dreamer" guy?
([posting.php?mode=quote&f=18&p=17948](http://forum.xentax.com/posting.php?mode=quote&f=18&p=17948))

If not are there any resources (not tools) that include information on file specs for
TIM2/3 files? (I haven't found any, only an extensive one about TIM1)

(If anybody has info on native file formats on the ps1/2/3/psp please post it too)

Bonus on TIM2 files: (from the makers of optix)

has probably all allowed RGBA data formats

Its looks like its really hard these days to come by the tim2 format specification.

Here is another Xentaxthread with the source for the tim2 photoshop-plugin: [viewtopic.php?f=10&t=1776&view=previous](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=1776&view=previous)
I also found this: [http://subversion.assembla.com/svn/Tim2/](http://subversion.assembla.com/svn/Tim2/) <--have no other info than the link for it...

[http://subversion.assembla.com/svn/Tim2 ... mat/Tim2.h](http://subversion.assembla.com/svn/Tim2/Tim2Format/Tim2.h) has what I need

Now all I need are sample files for TIM1/2/3, I only have  a few TIM2 files from psp games,
those are 32/16 Bit CLUT, I would need more formats, does anybody have some files to share? (pure RGB(A) or swizzled ones would be great)
