- Post Title: Doom Eternal

Hey everyone,

Seeing most of us had a field day with Doom 2016 I thought I'd create a thread here.
To make sure all the data we have is collected in one place.

As far as I've come to learn, Doom 2016 was running on IDtech6, Eternal is running on IDtech7.
Seeing it's a continuation of the original engine does anyone know if it's possible for us to use or update the tools we had for 16 on Eternal?

The link I still have from the old thread on FP was wraith, but not sure it works with IDtech7 or if it needs any modification to work.

Heya. 
A thread was already created with a .resources unpacker elsewhere on the forum, so you might wanna go there next, but regardless: the Wraith tool does not work with Doom Eternal. idTech 7 is fundamentally different than 6, and the biggest difference is with the absence of Megatextures. However, there are aspects of the tool that could potentially be carried over into Eternal, but I'm not quite sure about what those are yet.

Thanks for the info!
What thread can I find that in? because I've tried searching for doom or idtech gets me no results.
