- Post Title: [Request] Simple BMS script .bin -> json (have .bt)

Can anyone help me with making a simple BMS script that that converts this file into json? I have a .bt templete for it.

I would like it to look like this 

```
    {
     "Unknown0": 100,
     "Unknown2": 1,
     "Unknown3": 1,
     "Unknown4": 0,
     "Unknown5": 0,
     "Unknown6": 600,
     "Unknown7": 0,
     "Unknown8": 200,
     "Unknown9": 0,
     "UnknownA": 0,
     "UnknownB": 2,
     "UnknownC": 100,
     "UnknownD": -1,
     }
     
```

BMS is a bad choice for text format convertion. And honestly what's the point of this request given that all these fields are "Unknown"?

Anyway here's the bms script that meets with your need.

Thank you sir!

The reason for conversion is to find out what value means. Then I can name each one  These bin don't have an entry index, just an entry count (as you can tell)
