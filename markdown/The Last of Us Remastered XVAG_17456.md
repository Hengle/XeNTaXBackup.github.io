- Post Title: The Last of Us Remastered XVAG

Hi, I know there's a thread already explaining how to de-interleave XVAG, but I didn't know if it was the same for PS4. I opened them up in a hex editor, and saw that the XVAG has it's own little Wav file kind of encoded inside of it, but cutting all the bytes before the "riff" part and saving it as a wav yields a "Missing ACM Codec" error message from vgmstream. I was wondering if someone could point me in the right direction with these. Any help would be appreciated!

Best,
Anexenaumoon

Oh yeah, I messed with them too for a bit, nothing that is out there can convert them, vgmstream needs to be updated to support it as well.

also, you'd be better off posting the samples in the official forum, here can take months before the dev can see it, just saying, doesn't hurt.

make sure you include a large file, which is multichannel and a small file that can either be mono or stereo.

cheers

vgmstream now plays those.
