- Post Title: Sandlot Games encrypted .dat files

Hello.

I wanted to request some help extracting files from an old Sandlot game called "Cake Mania". More specifically, the first 3 ones.

There are some QuickBMS scripts for these games, but I found that none of those work on any version available online. I tried using them on 3 different retail versions that are available on Archive.org: a physical release by eGames and 2 digital releases by PopCap and Reflexive. All 3 versions have a "data" folder with ".dat" files inside.

 From what I was able to research, back at the time aluigi maded his scripts, the game used a ".pak" extension to contain its files, which was a file format from the PopCap Framework, also used in the Plants vs Zombies game. I also tried to use the script provided to unpack 7x7m packed files, but it also didn't work.

My guess is that the game was updated by Sandlot one last time to enhance it's encryption probably for its Steam release back in 2009.

The files can be found below. Thanks in advance for any help.
