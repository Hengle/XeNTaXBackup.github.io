I have some *.scg/txg files that I would like to convert.
However, I don't know how to convert them.
Can anybody help?

The pak files are compressed.
The txg files are uncompressed and just contain a bunch of textures and should be easily unpacked.
I don't see any scg's

Did you upload the wrong files?
