Completely blitzed as to how to get into this game's data files.

As usual, the first 10MB uploaded and I also uploaded the .bhd5 file.

EDIT: Chrrox's script can unpack the archive. I have tested it and it works flawlessly

Thanks for your help chrrox

.bdt/.bhd5 are not encrypted sdat files.

Edit: your sample are junk / encrypted data, how did you copy the files from the game disc? Seems incorrectly ripped.

Aye, I should have been more specific.

Open up the 3GB+ file in a hex editor, save the first 10MB and then upload it and post the link here

Your samples are still junk, they do not represent data from a proper copy of the game. I've looked at data from my disc and they are not encrypted.

I tried with offzip but when I use -z 15 it asks me to try  -z -15, when I do that, it asks me to use -z 15 @_@

Here's what I'm inputting to the cmd line

offzip -a -1 -z 15 "input file" "extraction folder" 0x00

Yes and I still get the same problem.

It gets to about 0x73AC358 before it tells me "zlib Z_DATA_ERROR, the data in the file is not in zip format or uses a different windowBits value (-z). Try to use -z -15

But when I do use -z -15 it tells me to try -z 15

When I do -z 15, it tells me to try -z -15 again :\

just ignore the errors there is small bits of data that is not zlib that is not game data thats normal just let it run to th eend of the file.
With this method there is no way to repack.

do you have the latest offzip?
what files are you looking for?
it is the 360 version your running on correct?
its possible to make a bms script for this but there are no names so offzip should do the same thing.

yes, I downloaded the latest Offzip from Aluigi's site.

I'm looking for the XMA files. I tried scanning for the flag within the archive. But they're interspersed among everything else so it cuts extra data.

Pretty sure this version I have is good - It's the COMPLEX release. Although I could download another ISO or even a JTAG version to be completely thorough 

EDIT: Getting a JTAG version just to be sure.

For those researching, Dark Souls uses PCM WAV inside FSB containers.

Use Chrrox's BMS script to unpack the large archive

Im a bit confuse as to how to use Offzip for the bhd5 files. Do I have to place the offzip exe on C: or i can just put it in another drive?
