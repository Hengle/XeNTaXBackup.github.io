- Post Title: Rocket League Textures [PS4]

Hi all,i want to extract models from ps4 version of Rocket League(UE3),but textures are screwed. I've tried chrrox QuickBMS script but it doesnt seems to work for me.
I have already asked about this on umodel forums but have no luck.
Also not all textures extracts in dds format even if i run umodel with -dds option.

Here is the files:

That how it looks in umodel

i just ran chrrox bms script on your dds files and it built proper gnf headers, they all opened in Noesis.

My fault  But there is still a problem with tga textures that cant be exported in dds format.

I've tried to convert them to dds and use script but get this:



That should look like this:

Anyone? I dont have any clue what to do with textures that always come out in tga format so i cant convert them with chrrox script properly. I have tried to convert it in different dds formats and then use script but closest result i was able to get is still bad,i showed it in previous post. Im mostly interested in "Body_SweetTooth_Thumbnail" texture from one of tga ones.

I am trying to extract simple .tex textures from MLB 22 The Show PS4. One of those textures files is just ball textures and seem to be in tga format. However, I am not able to extract any of those textures. Get sample textures here [https://mega.nz/file/4YlhzCQC#nZ92vbAvc ... CltlfUOpVE](https://mega.nz/file/4YlhzCQC#nZ92vbAvc63IQiXy_dkgoFtv2IE3JPYmyCltlfUOpVE) in case someone could have a look.
