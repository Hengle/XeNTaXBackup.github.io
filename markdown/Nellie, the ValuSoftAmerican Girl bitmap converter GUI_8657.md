- Post Title: Nellie, the ValuSoft/American Girl bitmap converter GUI

Hmm, just thought of writing a rather shitty GUI to Nazaroff's commandline kk.exe tool he made in [this thread](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=18&t=7938). The BMS for getting the files off the .fmv archives can be downloaded here: [viewtopic.php?f=10&t=7716](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=7716)



I named my frontend after Nellie O'Malley, who was a friend to Samantha Parkington and a former servant.
The tool and GUI should work on A Treehouse of My Own, but I'm not sure if this would also work on Mia Goes for Great and Julie Saves The Eagles.
