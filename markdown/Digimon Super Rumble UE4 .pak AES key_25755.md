- Post Title: Digimon Super Rumble UE4 .pak AES key

Digimon Super Rumble requires AES key for Glidor's umodel, I tried many tools but to no avail. I don't know if client pulls it from the internet but even the "memory" part didn't work. If it's required I can upload main exe to mega nz and put the link here. All help is appreaciated. Thanks beforehand! 

Also sorry if this thread doesn't belong here but since I figured it's about "decompression" technically, it should belong here
