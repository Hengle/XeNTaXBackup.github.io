- Post Title: Kabuki Klash and/or Neo Geo graphic format (SPR)

I have noted that nowhere is there any documentation on this SPR format oddly. I've identified it as a standard image format though at least in this game (Everything that is graphical is SPR, the NeoGeo equivelant to BMP?) Well anyways I'll provide a few examples here. Hopefully there will be a way to view and perhaps convert them.

Here's some for comparison. In case there are differences.

Here's another, if there are no palettes I have a good idea where those are.

Figured it out. There are tools that were made to edit and view the SPR files and the palette data is stored in PRG files. I've managed to get hold of these tools.

Edit: The problem is FINDING the correct pallette.
