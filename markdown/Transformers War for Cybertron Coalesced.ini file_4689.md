Hello,

Does anyone know a way to unpack the coalesced.ini file then provide a way to repack it once edits are made?  It seems that the methods uses for ME2 are not working for this file.

I have the same problem, but with the .int file. The Mirror's Edge unpacker doesn't work either. Can anybody help us? I want to translate the game, but the UI's texts are in this file.
