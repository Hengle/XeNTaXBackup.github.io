- Post Title: help extracting texture files from area 51 pc.000 files

im not sure if anyone even plays this game anymore but im sure some people might now how to extract the textures from .000 files. ive searched the web and everyone and everything says 7zip or winzip or iso openers but they dont work. as the title says im trying to extract the textures from the game. specifically the first person arm and hand files. there is a topic that has a modding tool but the link is down. i found the tool at an alternate download but it just extracts a bunch of text files. there are 5 .000 files there names are preload, strings, resource, hires, and common. because i play with the high res texture setting im guessing that the textures i want would be in that .000 file.


if anyone could tell me how to do this or do it for me it would be of great help. what i want to do is give the player character Ethan Cole Gloves in first person. they wont be the greatest if i do them because i just do colors with a design i dont try to give the gloves textures. i have posted comments in the topic that i mentioned earlier but apparently no one pays attention to it anymore becuase i posted it maybe 1 and a half to 2 years ago. the game came out in 2005 so it should be easy to figure out its either built on a modified unreal 3 engine or unreal 2 engine. i dont know if that will help  anybody out.


i would really appreciate the help. please and thank you

did you try texmod?
[http://www.fileplanet.com/205418/200000 ... xmod-v0.9b](http://www.fileplanet.com/205418/200000/fileinfo/Texmod-v0.9b)
if the game is not direct x 9 then you will have to pm someone a file to look at and they might help.
