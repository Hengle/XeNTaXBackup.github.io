The first one (zippyshare).  At least, it doesn't work for me, just says 403 Forbidden.

I don't think this, particular bms script could be edited in the way you want. I made some edits inside this script and extracted TableBin.sfc along with other important .sfc archives, but unfortunately there's no actual names in .sfc arhives, only hashes. I think, they should be linked to some file/files inside TableBin.sfc by heir hashes and you will get filenames, but we need attention of more experienced person in order to achieve that   
Here's script to extract TableBin.sfc, maybe it will help you with your goal to get proper file extractor xD

Thanks for your edited script! Now we can extract more valuable assets from the game.
Now I'm looking into the headers.sfc file.Maybe it will help.
