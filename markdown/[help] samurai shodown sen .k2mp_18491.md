- Post Title: [help] samurai shodown sen .k2mp

I want to modify .k2mp models and replace model files. 
here is some discussion about that. ([viewtopic.php?f=16&t=10362](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=10362))
I don't know much about the script. I'm sorry if it was too much to ask, please making a tool that can convert 3d models.
please take a look at the sample files. ([http://www.mediafire.com/file/uxrf6dq34 ... D.zip/file](http://www.mediafire.com/file/uxrf6dq34oc1a6k/SSED.zip/file))
My English is poor, sorry.

(Is there any 3d model to K2MP converter already?)

> I don't know much about the script.the script is easy to understand up to the line
"append UV_array[tu,tv,0]"

You don't need to know about the script but you need to know about the K2MP format. And you need to know "in depth" (full format analysis) to gain your goal.

> I'm sorry if it was too much to ask, please making a tool that can convert 3d models.Searching the forum you'll barely find some "obj to whatever(binary)format conversions". Because it's not easy to perform.

using hex2obj (view link in my sig):
