Can anyone here help me rip this archive? It doesn't appear to be a standard .ARC format package, and I don't think it's any similar to the ones used by Nintendo either.

Let me know if you guys are interested in cracking this thing, so that I can PM you a link or two to the files in question.

Anyone willing to help me out on this?
