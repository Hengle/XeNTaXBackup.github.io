- Post Title: Extracted 3 very strange formats: .bin .nxb .cfg Can it be converted to fbx model?

hi guys
In the nine days of PCgame, three very strange formats were extracted, .bin .nxb .cfg
bin may be a model file
nxb may be an animation file or material
How can I convert the model to the general format of OBJ or FBX?

There's always a way called "help yourself".

From what I can tell, nxb stores a lower res version of the same mesh.

Thanks to Bigchillghost for his outstanding work, is this a model obtained in decompiled form?
The picture seems to be a thumbnail, and the parameters are not clear  
How do I extract it? Hope for help

Isn't it weird to refer to someone that you're talking to as a third person?  
People are used to call it reverse engineering, if that's what you mean. You can obtain the tool from the 2nd link in my signature.

Nice to have seen the full image
I’ll reverse engineer the model as you said
