- Post Title: [PS and PS2] Choro Q Series. TSQ and TVB Format.

hi there.

I want convert (or Create) TVB  and TSQ files to PSF 2 or PSF.

It was not possible to create in VGMToolbox.

Against TVB file, TSQ more files exists. 
Whereas there TVB file is 255KB,
There TSQ file is 23KB.

so I,
TSQ file is SEQ file. (midi sequence)
TVB file is VB and VH file. (Sound font or sound source data)
Thinks.

Please tell me how to convert. 

sorry bad English.

TSQ and TVB.

Hello, I know this is a old question, but I started a few days ago analyzing Choro Q 2 (Road trip adventure PS2) data files. Did you happen to resolve your problems?

Thanks
