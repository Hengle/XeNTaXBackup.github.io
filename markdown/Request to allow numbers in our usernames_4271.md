- Post Title: Request to allow numbers in our usernames

Hi there everyone. I am very eager to join this website, so I can be able to extract archives in Just Cause 

But anyhow, on a normal basis, I use tgp1994 as my username. It's just what I do. Is there a chance an administrator could allow numbers in our usernames and/or change mine to tgp1994 as well?

I understand that you guys were having trouble with spam bots, but a custom word field and a CAPTCHA image should be plenty.

Thanks!

Ok, thanks for giving it some thought 

In the mean time, would you kindly change my username to tgp1994?

Wait, numbers aren't allowed in usernames? Since when (considering my own username, this obviously hasn't been the case forever...)?

Well, I guess that leaves quite a timespan 

Perhaps some sort of new spambot software was released that got around some time of spambot protection, but maybe that software only made spambots with numbers in their names. But of course, spam bots can be completely avoided by getting reCAPTCHA.

I signed up yesterday and have 90 in my name.  I didn't see the no numbers allowed until afterwards.  Just make sure you put a reason in for joining.

Pretty sure I did. Maybe Mr. Mouse re enabled it without telling me.

True, 5 1/2 years is a very long time online.
