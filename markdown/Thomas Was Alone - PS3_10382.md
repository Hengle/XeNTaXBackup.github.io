- Post Title: Thomas Was Alone - PS3

Hi everybody,
I would like to translate Thomas Was Alone for PlayStation 3, story line is great in this game, but I need script, or a tool to extract text and repack it after the translation is done. English.bin file is readable in NotePad, but I can't increase a number of letters per sentence..blah blah, same old "only HEX" problem.
Could anyone gave it a shot and help me out?

You are awe... wait for it.. some!!
Tool is working just fine. It works same way like tool for Rayman Origins for example, so it's easy to work with.
On the other side, it took me a while to make it work. ANY manipulation with english.bin leads to freeze during loading of save game data. Extracting pkg data, modifying english.bin and creating a new .pkg with original ContentID is the way to success. So finally, it works. Thank you again
