- Post Title: Final Fantasy XIII: YKD - 2D Animation File Format

Hi!

I [develop a tool](https://github.com/Albeoris/Pulse) for the localization of this game.
Now I need help to analyze [animation files (.ykd)](https://yadi.sk/d/74eFcw12fGn8Q)

Known information:
1) Top of gr_gameover.ykd:


2) Some block with content from gr_gameover.ykd:


3) End of gr_gameover.ykd:


Please help to analyze unknown values.

Thank you for your attention.

I created [IO classes](https://github.com/Albeoris/Pulse/tree/master/Pulse.FS/YKD) for repack these files.
Special thanks to blackbird1912.

But there are still many gaps. Help is still needed. (=
