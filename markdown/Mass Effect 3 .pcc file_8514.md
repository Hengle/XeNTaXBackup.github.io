- Post Title: Mass Effect 3 .pcc file

I've already used Rick's [tools](http://svn.gib.me/builds/masseffect3/) to unpack few .pcc files. There are several .bin files inside of unpacked .pcc content. But I don't have any idea to decompress them. There is also an exe file named Gibbed.MassEffect3.DecompressPackage, but I'm not sure what is that for. Can anybody help me? Thanks.

Aren't the .bin files just 1kb linkers?

PPC files (Unreal Package's) compressed with ZLIB. Gibbed.MassEffect3.DecompressPackage used for decompressing.

I've done that myself already, as stated, they're full of *.bin files...  Largest I've seen of them is 400kb

Exactly. I've tried to decompress them first then unpack them. But still there are only .bin files.
