- Post Title: Overlord II XRP.LZX files

Hello all I'm trying to recover and upload all models from the game Overlord II, but I've ran into a problem with a unknown format. The game's files were only found on digital store fronts (this one being from Xbox live) and are compressed in a xrp.lzx file format. I know LZX was common for Microsoft during the 7th gen, but I've no clue what xrp let alone what xrp.lzx is. Seems like not much is know about it online other. So I'm posting here in hopes of trying to find a answer. I would post the files for people to look at (since they are no longer available for purchase), but they are too much for the 1mib cap. I'll probably either send them via pm or link to like mega or something for others to download and check them out. Anyway hope someone can help out, would be much appreciated!
