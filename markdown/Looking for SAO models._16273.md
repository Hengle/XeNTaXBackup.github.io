- Post Title: Looking for SAO models.

Now I have seen a few topics about SAO models but not a lot. I am looking to see if any one has or can help me get SAO (sword art online) models. Basically any thing and everything there is. I want to see how the models are modeled. i dont care about textures really. any help would be great thanks.

I will also like to use this post as a collection of all SAO models in the future. If that is ok.

Is there even a Sword Art Online game to extract models from?

EDIT: I take it back. There are SAO games.
