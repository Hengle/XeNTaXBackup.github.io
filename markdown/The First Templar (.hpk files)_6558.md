I don't know, but I think that it works with uncompressed files.

Well, it isn't using the modified and extracted .lua, so maybe someby'll find a way to get it to work.

Unpack the Local\English.hpk, move the CurrentLanguage (or something) unpacked folder into the root of the game, and rename/delete the Local\English.hpk.

Fenris93

Use the program HPKArchiver for unpack it and pack these files. I tested in this game and it worked perfectly.

Hello guys.
After many years, I still haven't found an unpacker for this game. Interested in models, sounds and more. Maybe there are already unpackers and I just searched badly? Thank you

No one know how to extract? 12 years past and no extractors.

Yes, you've searched badly.   I've merged your topic with some older topic on this forum to avoid duplicates.

This game has archives with HPK extension. You can see specification here [http://wiki.xentax.com/index.php/Haemimont_Engine_HPK](http://wiki.xentax.com/index.php/Haemimont_Engine_HPK)
And you can use "HPK archiver" for unpacking and packing [https://github.com/nickelc/hpk](https://github.com/nickelc/hpk)

According to this topic [viewtopic.php?t=6596](https://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?t=6596)
some models are in BIN files.

But I'm not an expert in models. You can ask for help in the topic I've linked.
