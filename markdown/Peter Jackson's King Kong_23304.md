- Post Title: Peter Jackson's King Kong

I've been trying to delve into the game's files but I've been hitting a bunch of brick walls. The files are in the BF format (part of the Jade engine), but most of the converters out there for other games using the same engine don't work. I thought the BFextractor tool would be promising but it doesn't seem to be doing anything even when I run it in CMD. IrisTool also doesn't work either. Someone has had to have success though because I've seen some of the models floating around. Anyone have any luck getting into the files?
