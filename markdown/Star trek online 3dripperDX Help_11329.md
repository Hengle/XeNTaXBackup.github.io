I can't help you with DXripper, but i got Ninjaripper working by placing the d3d9.dll in the "live" folder.
An issue i had was that i downloaded the game via Steam, and a subsequent update installed a second "Star Trek Online" folder in the existing one. It was this new folder i had to make Ninjaripper make STO launch from to make it work.
Ninjaripper, however, fails to capture many of the textures and only delivers very lo-res versions.

Ninjaripper works best.

Just be aware the updater regularly overwrites the DLLs. so you have to wait for the "Engage" button to show up, then place the Ninjaripper DLL's in place. if do you it before, they will be overwritten by the original valid DLL's every time.
