- Post Title: XPR & BIN Files

I'm looking for a way to extract all textures,models,assets from a favorite game of mine. (Tenchu Z)  

A user by the name "Vashley" Attempted this while back and i'm not sure the outcome,prior to contacting them via, PM

I'm able to open the iso and extract all the content's but at my level of knowledge. Im not sure how to view/edit these files. The file extension type is in .XPR format. and the others are in BIN. format. 
Using xpert tool to extract the iso. , hoping it would also extract those bin files but nothing.

I'm providing a sample file for those whom need it.

Ok! so i got into some of the other files now i'm searching for a Plugin for Neosis or QuickBMS for BIN. files for my game.Im wonder is there a plugin already floating around online?If so would you mind linking me to it,so i can have a look. Tenchu Z,which is for Xbox360 and produced by K2.

The files i've attached are the BIN files i was browsing through.Also the panel on the right is a Header? , as is saying that within this BIN folder is XPR2 & TX2D formated files?
If someone could assist me that would be helpful , Thanks

yep, just change the extension from bin to xpr and open with Noesis using the script here
