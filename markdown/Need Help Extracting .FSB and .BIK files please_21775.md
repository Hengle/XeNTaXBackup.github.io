- Post Title: Need Help Extracting .FSB and .BIK files please

Hey all,

I'm sure this is probably super easy and I'm missing something obvious here. But I'm trying to extract the audio from some .FSB files and video from .BIK files and I've come up empty handed. I've tried dozens of FSB extracting programs and game extractors. I'm on a Mac using Wine to run the majority of the Windows programs and that only goes so far, the majority of them won't even load. I'm guessing they're encrypted because I've had some other FSBs that imported into Audacity with no issues. 

I really have no idea what I'm doing, haha. Anyone have a tip? Would be much appreciated.

The FSBs are in the Sounds folder and BIKs are in the Movies folder

Yes, those files are definitely encrypted.

Without knowing the encryption method and key, it would be difficult to get the data.  Hopefully someone will know, as the extraction part after that is easy.

Thanks for that info. Is the encryption key stored somewhere on the disc? Would a different console (Wii, Xbox, etc) be easier to decrypt?
