- Post Title: Shaiya Client Mod for Private Server READ PLZ GREAT IDEA!! ^

I posted this on elitepvpers.de btw

Hey I got a GREAT and NIFTY idea for a private server...
 You remember how we used to play modded Battlefield 1942 with Desert Combat, Eve Of Destruction, and Galactic Conquest, and the pirates mod and all that other neat stuff?

 Or when we hack over emulators with different mip maps and vector graphix and make stuff like Afro Mario and Super Cat Mario, and Super Mario Frustration?


 Dood! I got a great idea!!

 Lets make one or.. Can I get access to graphix and sound utilities to make it myself?

 I want to call it "Up Your Area" you know.. like it's right up your area?

 Change the whole front end Give the darkies Nerf weapons or 5 foot long dildos or something bizarre like that. Or go on a serious not and give them Dragon lance weaponry.

 make the lighties like Lord Of The Rings, or some other cool type theme, Make dispel pots and whatnot renamed and remapped as cooler sounding pots, with cooler graphix to boot!

 Umm.. Gems instead of gold bars Have platinum instead of gold... ummm 

 I dunno... If I wanted to take on a sci fi project I could model it after robotech, and have ur ridable mounts Gundams or sailormoon bombshells and put all the women in lacey underwear with squeeky toys! ^_^


 Just a thought....


 Any Suggestions would be welcome!  

 I will be recieving a server tower via international mail within a few weeks that has dual core xeon processors on it and 32 gigs of ram on board so I'm thinking of actually doing this because I have no life, and no job.

At the very least it will be entertaining. ^_^

You'd probably have better luck with elitepvpers or ragezone, seeing how they specialize in building servers.

There are probably some tools lying around here for shaiya, but other than that I've only really seen chrrox's maxscript in his 3D reversing tutorial.

But man, 32 gigs, can technology these days use that?
