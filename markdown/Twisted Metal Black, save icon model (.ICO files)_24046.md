- Post Title: Twisted Metal: Black, save icon model (.ICO files)

Hi, I was looking for any help regarding memory card saves, sometimes where a specific game has 3D models on memory cards, more so I’d like to rip the miniature Sweet Tooth head off of Twisted Metal: Black’s files, as I extracted all files off my copy and looked at the "MEMCRD" folder, there’s ".ICO" files and I assume that’s where a 3D model and it’s textures are stored in some PS2 titles, I could be wrong, after all it’s my first attempt, thanks for any feedback.

.ico is icon. You cant extract models from this. If it is possible it would be a .TMD file but i doubt there is any kind of mesh there.
