- Post Title: Dark Cloud .TM2 Interlacing

Hey guys.

So having a bit of a headache with Dark Cloud right now. The .TM2 files are stored uncompressed and can simply be extracted by brute force. But half of them are interlaced, which results in:

If I load them into Game Graphic Studio, I get:

Which deinterlaces the image but then messes up the colour palette.

Any help would be appreciated! Here's a sample .tm2 file with the interlacing problem: [http://slynch.ovh/Downloads/ebat.pak_1.tm2](http://slynch.ovh/Downloads/ebat.pak_1.tm2)

For any Dark Cloud fans, here's some beta content I found while pilfering the textures that aren't messed up:

Cheers mate, I've put up my own mirror as well, to be on the safe side: [http://slynch.ovh/Downloads/ConsoleText ... _v0.1a.zip](http://slynch.ovh/Downloads/ConsoleTextureExplorer_v0.1a.zip)

The tool only does size in powers of two though, and it's not open source  which makes batch-fixing/converting the textures a nightmare.
