- Post Title: DIGIEYE Miku App .ani files.

Hi guys, I have a small problem that I would like to try and figure out (if possible.)

DIGIEYE AR is an app for the iOS/Android using the Unity Engine, I was able to easily extract all the models and textures with bones using "Unity Studio". But I have yet to find a way to use the .ani files (which I assume are the animation files) on the model because it is unsupported.

Any help is appreciated!
