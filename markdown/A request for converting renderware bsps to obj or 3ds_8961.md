- Post Title: A request for converting renderware bsps to obj or 3ds

Hello, i am requesting a program that will be able to convert the bsp version that supports version 11. I've been looking everywhere in google and no one has made a decompiler and converter for one of the Sonic Heroes level world bsps. Could someone think of a program that will support the version 11 and its not a Quake, Unreal or any other bsp map. Its a renderware bsp level map that i want to decompile and use in MilkShape3D.
