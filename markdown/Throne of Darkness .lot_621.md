Is anyone familiar with this format?  My experience with this sort of thing is virtually non-existant, but if anyone has anything they can do to help me extract the files from this format , I would be most grateful.  

This was a game by Click Entertainment published by Sierra.  It suffered from poor advertising and little publicity and now sells for about $5 USD.  It does, however, have some great graphics and such that I'd love to be able to play with.  

Can anyone help or at least point me in the right direction?

When I have time I will look at them.
