Hello everyone!

I have a question, is there any tool capable of CONVERTING .FWSE format audio files to .WAV?

I have looked everywhere into it but I can't seem to find any. I am also 0% skilled with coding so writing a tool myself would be nearly impossible (trust me, I tried coding a calculator in C++ once and I got a headache after 4 hours of trying).

Thank you very much for your answer,

Amy.

MTF v1 games were always used ADPCM, Vorbis and SE codecs, my knowlege of audio codecs is very limited, so I don't know what SE codec really means.

```
	uint Version;
	uint fileSize;
	uint bufferOffset;
	uint numChannels;
	uint numSamples;
	uint sampleRate;
	uint sampleDepth;
	char palette[992]; //4bit?
```

Code: Select all	uint ID;
	uint Version;
	uint fileSize;
	uint bufferOffset;
	uint numChannels;
	uint numSamples;
	uint sampleRate;
	uint sampleDepth;
	char palette[992]; //4bit?
thanks so much, do you think that it'll be possible to write a tool to handle in specific this formar? I tried to talk to Gh0stBlade (he have experience writing tools for this format) about this and he said that he have a tool but he have no intentions on sharing it, so if anyone could help me i could even pay for it.

As of recent time, I had made SPAC extractor with built in FWSE converter.
[https://github.com/PredatorCZ/RevilToolset](https://github.com/PredatorCZ/RevilToolset)
I will also try to post a converter into the vmgstream project, since it's already part of it, but only on my fork so far.
After that, a raw FWSE files can be opened/converted by any app using vgmstream or it's plugins.

Is there any tutorial? I tried on pc and it just says:invalid format.Thread{0x4E4}

It doesn't work on fwse files, only on SPC archives, that contains them.
