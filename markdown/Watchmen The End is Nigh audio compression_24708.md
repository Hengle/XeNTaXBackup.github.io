- Post Title: Watchmen The End is Nigh audio compression

I'm trying to get to the game audio, specifically the voice lines (music is a different format). The voice lines are stored in the game file as .wav extensions but they don't follow the .wav file structure. Trying to import them into Audacity requires raw data importing, and the closest I can get to how the voice line is supposed to sound is importing as 8-bit signed PCM, mono, and 22050 Hz. Even then the audio is heavily distorted so I think the actual compression format is something other than what Audacity expects.

A sample voice file is attached, and how it's supposed to sound ("Damn door is shut and there's no lock to pick. There must be some other way around... ") is between 59:40 and 59:45 of this YouTube video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQUoSQmGVgI#t=59m40s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQUoSQmGVgI#t=59m40s) for comparison.

I have another sample file from the Xbox 360 port of the game, it's still headerless audio but it looks to be compressed differently than the PC counterpart (XMA?); samples attached.
