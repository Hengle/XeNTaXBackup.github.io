In XBOX 360 Orange Box, I would like to add Korean language. Actually, Half-Life and Portal have Korean language on PC. However, Orange Box released for Xbox 360 does not have Korean language. Is it possible to port the Korean subtitles that exist in the PC version to the XBOX orange box?

Maybe. But that requires some knowledge about Source Engine and Reverse Engineering.
You would also need a modded X360 console to test your changes.

I already have a modded X360 console, so I'll have to study Source Engine and Reverse Engineering later.
Thank you
