- Post Title: Battlefield 4 compressed textures

the cas.cat files from battlefield 3 and 4 can be extracted with a python script from bfeditor forum, the result of this are chunks and itexture,ebx, etc.

the itexture data contains the name of the image chunk 
this chunks are simple dds but bf4 use a compression on his textures



can anyone decompress the following files?
