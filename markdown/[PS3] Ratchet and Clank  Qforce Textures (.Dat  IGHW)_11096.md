Well the works for about half of the textures. 

The rest seem to be swizzled like this

It's supposed to be the Full Frontal Assault/Q-force logo.

There two images in that file. The first one is a q-force background which will view fine if you change the width to 1280.
The second image is the swizzled logo which I cut out and put into the link I gave.
