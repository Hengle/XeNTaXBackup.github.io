Hello 

I am trying to get cars extracted from game "Ford Racing Off-Road". 

The files are ".PC"

Sample of bronco: [https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/ ... BRONCO.zip](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/872879593156116490/923740594524807198/BRONCO.zip)

This oneâ€™s not that easy. Tried decompressing the textures file with compression search and got no valuable result. Therefore it all says that the file must be ciphered- didn't find XOR patterns so must be something else, interesting. 

The bin file has easy structure of file EOF, hint pointers and casual null terminator strings and... that's all, only names. 

Bad news: the game probably requires reverse engineering to find what the heck is going on with those files.

No, it's just ZLIB compressed data. File format looks like this:

```
x bytes - ZLIB data
```


So you can use offzip to extract data:

```
offzip.exe -a textures.pc
```


Here is the result for textures.pc file [https://i.imgur.com/LCXXCmd.png](https://i.imgur.com/LCXXCmd.png)
