There's a problem with the Online WIKI resource when loading from MultiEx Commander. I will check this soon.

Hmm... I sure hope this isn't anything to do with the edits I've been making recently...

No, it had to do with an edit by Xennex. He forgot to put the game names and platforms between single quotes when posting a new script. My lousy web code was not expecting this. I fixed his entry and it works once again.

Okay, that's good... Err, I mean, umm... never...mind...?

Anyways, do you have plans for updating your webcode? (I'd imagine so)
