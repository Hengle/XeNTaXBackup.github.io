THE advantage of understanding Project igi 2 file structures is that you probably extend your discovery into
other Codemasters games (like dirt)
[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_igi_2](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_igi_2)
my search on web about Project igi 2 .res archives show me that no tools for this game developed yet !
i tried other extractores like : Dragon UnPACKer , game extractor , ......
but none of them rips the .res archives of Project igi 2 and the extractor that i mentioned to it and is able to rips .res archives , it supports .res archives of game (rage  of mages) and it rips the .res archives of Project igi 2 suddenly !
I attached different files type of Project igi 2 for you , please a deft check the file structures , whether contains any 3d data or chunks , thanks a lot !

content of attachment :
one .txt file , contains directory structure of geme , dir /s
often 3d models are in .spr format

the IGI2 archives (luckily I still had the demo here) are chunks based and use a lot of padding... really boring.
this [script](http://aluigi.org/papers/bms/igi2.bms) should be able to extract any file and data (included the strings in messages.res which are not real files) from these archives

i managed to play the wav files. actually they are ADPCM 4 bit and hex shows .ilsf    i think ilsf stands for inner loop sound file which is the developer of IGI.

if anyone needed help can contact me via my youtube channel

Hello.
I extracted IGI1 audio files.

I was able to fix some sounds with Audacity software, but I couldn't do all the sounds!

How to play and use these sounds?

Hey man i hope everything is fine with you.
to decode those IGI 1 .wav files to playable .wav files you do the below process 
1- download  Project_IGI_1_Audio_Decoder_By_rkthelegend.zip from the link 
2-extract it somewhere in your computer.
3-take the wav files you want to decode and copy them to Project_IGI_1_Audio_Decoder_By_rkthelegend folder.
4-rename the extension of those wav files to .frp 
5-finally drage and drop them to test.exe to decode.
thats it.  no rocket science no brain surgery.
 here is the link

Thankful. that was perfect.
But there is a problem with converting "common" sounds!
The following are the audio files:
IGI1 \ common \ sounds
I extracted the sounds from the sounds.res file


How to convert these files?

Bro for that you have to do a lo more 
1-use extractor.exe to extract wav file from sound.res 
2-do the process again with test.exe

That's exactly what I did
Apparently wav "common" sounds have different encryption !!
I played all level sounds, but "common" sounds are not compatible with this method !!
Could you

open Audacity; File--->import-->Raw data--->and give a file to it.
u have to reduce playback speed for some file to 0.5x or 0.49x or 1.0x.
and for save changes--> in menu bar--> Effect-->change speed-->and so on....
u can test playback speed with play-at-speed button ander help

goldwave can also make such changes  
enjoy

  I'm sure you are from IRAN, am I right?

You were able to play the sound of IGI .Res file, thats good, but tell me the big challenge, we're you able to extract them with proper file names and readable wav or ogg file?  I sure your answer is No.

This Igi game is not something easy to figure out by rookies, 
WHat you did is good for you right now but I did these 4 years ago and still i have the software and tools for Igi with me.

Good luck

It's a secret and will remain a secret forever, unless a legend can write or do something for it.

for extract them with proper file names and readable wav or ogg file; Audacity >file > export > export as MP3 or WAV or OGG and....
before it; some of audio need to change playback speed to 0.5x or 0.6x or...
