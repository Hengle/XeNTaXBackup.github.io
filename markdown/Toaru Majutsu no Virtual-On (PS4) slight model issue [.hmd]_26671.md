- Post Title: Toaru Majutsu no Virtual-On (PS4) slight model issue [.hmd]

I attempted to extract 3d models from the PS4 version of the game "Toaru Majutsu no Virtual-On", using gomtuu's import_valkyria add-on for Blender, with almost-complete success (since this game uses pretty much the same game engine/file formats as Valkyria Chronicles anyway). However there's just one thing that I noticed that didn't turn out correctly: on [at least] one of the character models, one of the "Decal textures" isn't showing up in the 3d viewport, despite it being displayed on the textures list. I've tried practically everything I could think of (tinkering with nodes, UVs, alpha transparency, etc.) but no luck. Below is an example screenshot for reference.

P.S. If by some chance I have posted this in the wrong forum board, please shift it over to the correct one.

How about I just send you a link to a couple of sample models (with textures) instead?
[https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/rvb9d3l1 ... 15gvm571b3](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/rvb9d3l17791i4dc43qqv/h?dl=0&rlkey=sfkl6nogvomo17b15gvm571b3)

Will this work?
