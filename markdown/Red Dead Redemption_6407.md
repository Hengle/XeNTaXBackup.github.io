Hello fellow forum member's, I was just wondering if anyone has any sort of Idea about the Red Dead .RPF archive structure or has managed to make a tool or is willing to make one and share one with the public. I have tried but I just ain't got much of a clue, Any information on the tool would be much appreciated. Thank's
