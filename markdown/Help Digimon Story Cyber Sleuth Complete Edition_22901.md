Hi there everyone I am in need of help to fully decode the file format of the game and fix bugs.
One great individual name Pherakki started working on the game's model format and made a blender tool to import model files for the pc version of Digimon Story Cyber Sleuth: Complete Edition. He is still currently working on the tool and had made alot of progress but he needs help and heres what he needs : 
Most of the remaining unknown data either breaks the files or appears to have no effect if it is changed. There are a lot of files that can be checked for visual changes if these data are tweaked; but I am only a single person and it will take time to figure out what the rest of the data does. However, a lot of this data is loaded into Blender by Blender Tools for DSCS and is editable. These data are stored under the 'Custom Properties' of a a parent object, armature, mesh, or material. At the moment I don't have a clear experimentation plan set out. However, in the near future, I will provide guidance on how you can tweak the data present in the models to see what effect it has in-game. If you discover anything, it will help speed up development significantly!

Heres a link to Pherakki's page [https://github.com/Pherakki/Blender-Tools-for-DSCS](https://github.com/Pherakki/Blender-Tools-for-DSCS)

Also a great guy name SydMontague made the modding tool for the game and here is the link [https://github.com/SydMontague/DSCSTools](https://github.com/SydMontague/DSCSTools) please support his project for all his hard work!
