> I'm researching on ripping models from Tales of Xillia PSP game and I found this thread: viewtopic.php?f=10&t=7330

I extract the .TLDAT file in 1sec and stop to preview. Then first I got various Unknown file type, such as:

There maybe alot more file type if I continue.
Just only the .TOTEXB that could be extracted to .dds

So please help me, I'm a newbie though. My purpose is finding the model file and see how to rip a PSP game, since I love this game character.
I'm willing to study more even if it will take long time.

That's my old post, so please help me, I can guess some of the file type:
CHRDAT = Character data???
TOANIMB = Animation
TOMDLB = Model
TOTEXB = Texture
TOTEXP = Texture

How to open them? Thanks for any help

the problem with this game is the game uses 2 files at least for each model and the files have no names.

So it's called "really hard to rip" or "impossible", right?

I'll research more. Thanks 

Note: I can't provide samples because they are 1-50KB per file, so they won't help for you.
Maybe they are linked together with more than 10 thousand files extracted.
