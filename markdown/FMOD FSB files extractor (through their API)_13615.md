- Post Title: FMOD FSB files extractor (through their API)

There are two extractors, because some FSB files can only be extracted with one or another FMOD product.

fsb_aud_extr.exe (needs fmodL.dll from "FMOD Studio Programmer’s API")

fmod_extr.exe (needs fmodex.dll from "FMOD Ex Programmer’s API")

Moved to this new thread, so people don't have to search threads for latest versions.
