I have no idea how to extract these, if anyone could help that'd be awesome.

I have taken the liberty of uploading one of them to mediafire:

Thanks in advance

From what I've seen, they are CPK file variations, which have an "HCA" format (a.k.a. "ADX2"). Nobody knows how to decode it yet...

I figure when it comes to the PC Capcom will get lazy and just leave them as CPK's... I could've really used these files, dangit.

Nope, they created mutations of the CSB format as ACBs from the looks of it.

AWBs have been cracked!

PROCESS

This is the process... currently tested on the audio from the PS3 build; most likey possible for Xbox build as well

1. Rename .AWB files to .CPK files
2. Use CriPackedFileMaker.exe to open .CPK narrative files
3. Extract the contents of the .CPK files
4. Create a batch script to use HCA2WAV.exe * to convert all files to .WAV format

* Thanks goes to ProFrager for creating the HCA2WAV util.
