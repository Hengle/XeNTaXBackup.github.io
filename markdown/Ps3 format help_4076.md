- Post Title: Ps3 format help

I've been seeing lots of posts on other topics mentioning getting into ps3 games and thought about posting this topic just for ps3 reverse engineering questions, starting with a few of my own.

First off to be blunt and forgive me if I sound stupid for asking, is it possible to extract files from ps3 games? If so what tools or hardware are needed?

Second, with a lot of retail titles being released on multiple platforms, do the ps3 releases actually gain any benefit from bluray storage capacity; i.e.: ps3 releases have higher resolution textures and model datasets...
My most recent venture into the ps3 realm was with mgs 4, and though I have a bluray burner drive in my pc, the ps3 disc simply wouldn't read.

I hope there are answers out there, and that this topic can be a one-stop shop for all ps3 related questions on this site.  Thanks in advance to all who reply!

The only way to decrypt a retail ps3 game is with a debug tool and special programs that you run to get them decrypted "i have none"
so unless you have a dev ps3 you are out of luck unfortunately.

Looks like he's figured it out.

I see.  Well that's a bummer!  Reading the forums sounded like someone was able to get into FF XIII but obviously that must be the xbox 360 version, or someone with a development kit?

Eh? Can't seem to find any articles on FF XIII on xentax. Plus, the 360 version isn't out till March in Japan or the U.S, so it's either an extremely advance copy or the ps3 version.

Obviously speculation.  Just got me interested in seeing if there was any progress.  The link to the blogspot is really interesting.  Especially with all the "heat" around the FFXIII pics being posted up.  I'm also curious what this "metasequoia" application is...

I would be real interested in decrypting the bluray games to get to the files. i have tried the leaked ps3 sdk but no luck, couldnt find anything regarding decryption or debugging.

I couldn't find anything either.  I've never seen even a hint of the ps3 dev tools floating on the net as I've seen mentioned around forums online but i'm pretty sure you need a dev console just to use it?

it is easy to decrypt ps3 data if you have a debug ps3

Dev / debug consoles aside.  Someone said they got access to trophy data etc... I'm wondering how.  I do know you can do a Backup to an external drive on the PS3 I haven't tried yet, maybe they just found a way to access data from the backup.

what can do on debug/dev , if you get one, easy to know what it can 
btw, pay extreme cost to get one debug/dev system people i don't think they  look on backup. ( debug/dev cost = retail + $$$$ to buy alot game )

While decrypting games with a debug console might be possible (I have read lots of people claiming to have done it, but all dumps you can find on the internet are still encrypted because they were dumped with 'dd' on PS3-Linux), running backups or ISOs is definitely not possible with debug consoles.
This has to do with the signatures on the executables, in short: the games specify whether they are allowed to run from a decrypted BD-ROM or from HDD, if they don't have the relevant bit set to "1" the PS3 HV won't boot them from an alternative media. Oh, and you can't change that bit because the executable is signed and if the signature doesn't match, the HV won't boot it.

However, GeoHot's exploit might help there, I hear people are already frantically studying the source code of the HV trying to find exploitable bugs. Will take another few months however, I guess.

Yea.  I've definitely been keeping an eye on Geohot's blog.  While I see a lot of people interested in what his reverse engineering can bring to modding the PS3, and especially for claims to direct access to the memory worrying people about exploits like wallhacks etc... in games, there's also a lot of potential for less invasive pursuits for it, ie: actually developing content or getting access to the content of retail games.
