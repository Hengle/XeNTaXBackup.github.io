- Post Title: FUSER (Nintendo Switch) MOD?

I've been researching how to get the clues from FUSER, D'J's simulation game. So far I managed to get the encryption key of the pak files (Unreal Engine) and extract them with UnrealPakSwitch.

I have a lot of uasset and .uexp files



I tried opening it with vgmstream but it didn't work. I tried using Umodel on audio only, but it doesn't extract anything.


The game was compiled in version 4.23

Could we modify these tracks or add our own to mix?

Hey there! I'm really hoping to make progress in the world of FUSER modding by figuring out how to add stuff like album art, year/genre, and pickups, so it would be really helpful if you could perhaps give me what the encryption key is, and also if it is the same for all the different .paks or not. Thanks in advance!
