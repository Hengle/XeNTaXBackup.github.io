I don't know if my question is for here but... i'm just asking because i don't know if there's a way.

To the question:

Is there a way that the Assassin's Creed games (1, 2, Brotherhood, Revelations and maybe III, but "maybe") can be translated by fans?

Thx in advance for the answer.

As for AC1 - I suppose no.
In Russia xbox 360 version of this game is not translated (PS3 and PC versions are translated, officially).
And there is no fan port of the translation yet.
But all other games are translated, we have a lot of fan translators here. 
I suppose it's too hard to translate AC series.
