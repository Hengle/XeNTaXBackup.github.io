I found what appears to be the extracting routine in the disassembly of the file, I am using IDA Pro. I don't have much experience in analyzing assembly code...

Any hints?

After doing a bit of searching I found a tool that was able to extract some of the Killing Time game files. Using Necrotech FMV-Extractor, I let it scan my cd, and I was able to extract some of the non-musical sounds, and about a dozen extremely large .bmp's that are over 130MB apiece, that I can't open. It would be great though if I could get at those game textures, and those remaining non-musical sounds as well.
