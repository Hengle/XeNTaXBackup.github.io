- Post Title: Programs with direct assembly embedded

Before I start uploading anything: What is the official position here about programs that contain direct assembly code embedded that was ripped from game executables? I've made a few programs that contain original assembly embedded into my program, mainly decryption code (Nothing decrypts better than the original assembly code). But would that violate copyright or something, so that I shouldn't post it here? I'd absolutely post original programming I made here, but I'm not so sure about ones with code that isn't publicly available in source form. Please advise.
