- Post Title: Help needed Strife

Hello there,

I am trying to find the vertices,polygons,vertex indices and face indices of some files from strife so that i can create my own python script for noesis to view the 3d models in Noesis.But i am unable to find all of it as i don't have knowledge on Winhex.Could someone please find the vertices,polygons,vertex indices and face indices of the file for me and provide me that information so that i can create the script by watching mariokart64n's video.Download samples from below.
