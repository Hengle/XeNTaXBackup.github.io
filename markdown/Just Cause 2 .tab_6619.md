- Post Title: Just Cause 2 .tab

hello i came across the site just a little while ago while trying to figure out how to do this.

I've tried using "Gibbed Archive Viewer" but every time i try to extract the files it says the programs not responding, anyway i was wondering if someone could tell me if there is another program or how to fix the not responding problem I've tried run as admin, and also compatibility mode win xp sp 2/3

thanks for any help
