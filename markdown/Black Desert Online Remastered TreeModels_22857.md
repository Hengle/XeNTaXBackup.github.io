- Post Title: Black Desert Online Remastered TreeModels

hello,
i wanted to look at the trees in Black Desert Online Remastered(how they are made, because they look awsome).
I used the paz ectractor here:
[https://www.undertow.club/downloads/bla ... wser.2893/](https://www.undertow.club/downloads/black-desert-online-paz-files-browser.2893/)
and got the Speedtree Files(.srt)

But when i try to open them(Speedtree/Speedtree fur unreal Engine or Unreal Engine 4) but non is working.
 here i tried an upload of one of the files: [https://easyupload.io/dhxzsd](https://easyupload.io/dhxzsd) password should be 1234
Any ideas what i could do?
