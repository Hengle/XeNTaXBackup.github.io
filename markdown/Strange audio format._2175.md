- Post Title: Strange audio format.

Even after uncompressing from did.dat TAW Speech wavs files they appear  still to be in compressed format. 

AUDACITY does not recognise them for editing. Other sound program identifies them as: 
8000 HZ, 1 Bit, Mono, DSP TrueSpeech(TM).

I can play them in Win Media Player or Real with no problem. I also suceeded to batch convert them to 8 bit wavs which grew them substantailly in size (original full speech folder 4095 files ~4 MB , converted to 8 bit wav, mono, ~27 MB). Only now they can be edited. 

But I wonder what is that "8000 HZ, 1 Bit, Mono, DSP TrueSpeech(TM): format and why WMP and Real plays them but all  other known to me sound editors cannot save them in the same format ?

The other proggy I tried was WavePad. Unlike Audacity it loaded, but did not want to save in the same format.

Basically the problem is that none of those editors can save in lesser than : 8000kHz, 8Bit Mono 7kb/sec . I need still less.

Blessed be this forum place of true wisdom and solution to all and any problem.   
Savage I owe you big beer man.   It works (at least conversion after edit) . I hope the game wont object now. Thanks really a milion. 

NB. I am very  in audio formats. Is that 1 bit DSP TrueSpeech something from the "ancient" computer  times?  Or it is just rare?
