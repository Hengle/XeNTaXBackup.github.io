- Post Title: F1 2009 wii

Hi:
I'm trying to update the f1 2009 codemasters game for wii..

For now, I have drivers name updated to season 2011.. and I would like to unencode the cog files inside the iso.

The cog files are binary which have one/several tga files with drivers pictures, cars, etc..

Can anyone help, please??

I saw two videos in youtube from a person who made an unpacker/packer for this files, but he didn't share the program.. but he did a custom f1 for psp which uses the same format.

Thanks you so much.

I have the unpacker made by the guy who made the F1 2010 PSP video if you want, but it's only for PSP, I don't know if it works for the Wii or not
