(Not the newest version, see the first post)

New version (0.7-20111103)
In very few cases there are .arc files (only filename I have seen is effect.arc) that have misaligned header/data parts,
those are only found in Totw:RM 2 inside other .bin (GZip compressed .arc files)
files, currently only the header extraction works, the data part is still misaligned.


@ShinKun: Sorry I forgot to include all the necessary files in the exe.
Uploaded a working one.
