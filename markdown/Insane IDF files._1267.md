If anyone is still interested in 2021 in modding of "Insane",
you can check my article about IDF files [http://wiki.xentax.com/index.php/Insane_1nsane_IDF](http://wiki.xentax.com/index.php/Insane_1nsane_IDF)

I have also created a quickbms script for extracting data with filenames
[https://github.com/bartlomiejduda/Tools ... script.bms](https://github.com/bartlomiejduda/Tools/blob/master/NEW%20Tools/Insane%201nsane/Insane_IDF_script.bms)

There are also some other tools for modding listed on the wiki page.
