- Post Title: Transfomers The Game - Converting a csc file to gsc?

I've got a file from Transformers The Game Wii that isn't on the PC Version. Myself and many others are hoping to use it on the PC version one day. Does anyone think it'd be possible to convert a csc file to the same format that the PC versions uses? (Gsc) If it's not possible, can someone provide details as to why?  The main file I want to convert is HOOVEREXT.CSC               But I'm also linking two other files, AIRBASE.CSC and AIRBASE.GSC, a file that's on both Wii and PC, to directly compare the difference between formats and give an idea of what I'm hoping HOOVEREXT.CSC can become.

HooverExt is an unused level, which has leftover files in some versions of the game, the wii archive is the most complete one. The only file missing for this level on PC is it's gsc file. If that were to "exist" then We'd have access to a new level on the PC version.

That would probably require to complete reverse engineer of both CSC and GSC file formats to perform 100% valid conversion.

Thanks for the reply. It's not impossible then? Unfortunately a complete reverse engineering of these two files types is most definitely beyond my current skill level. Ah, well. If anyone can help out with these files, that'd be great. If not, no harm done. The level is at least "playable" on the Wii version. (With absolutely terrible controls, but I can't whine too much, it's neat to even see the level run.)
