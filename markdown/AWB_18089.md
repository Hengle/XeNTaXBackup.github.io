I tried to extract .awb file. But when i use quickbms+script (awb_afs2.bms) i get 00000000.dat instead hca file. How to extract that 00000000.dat?
awb from mobile game Dragon Ball Legends

Here link for awb and acb [http://www.mediafire.com/file/wsmen3xltknee3m/bgm11.rar](http://www.mediafire.com/file/wsmen3xltknee3m/bgm11.rar)

about .dat files... check it with a hex editor
as i know... dat files are hca or adx... you can find some tools to edit them
and we cant import bigger files with awb_afs2.bms
and we need to edit .acb files too...
Hopefully, this is not an compressed file...
i need to edit this files too

about .acb files
a awb file packed in every acb file! the bad thing is... we cant export and import awb files from acb files
acb is a UTF-8 header file, but this is not just like pes games(football) in cpk archive
and all files in awb and acb has a special name and those names are located in acb file... and quickbms script, its a simple code and i know that some guys changed this format, any help or solution?
