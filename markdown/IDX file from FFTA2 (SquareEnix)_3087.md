- Post Title: IDX file from FFTA2 (SquareEnix)

Hi!   
I'm trying to understand something about how is indexed the file PC.BIN.   

There are 2 file:
PC.IDX (20 kb) and PC.BIN (83 MB)

I think PC.BIN are all files put together and the PC.IDX file got the index of every file or got the pointer to every block.
(PC.BIN contains graphics and texts of the game)

Is there anyone that could help me?

Thanks!!   

PC.BIN is uploaded to: [http://www.filefactory.com/file/e6793d/](http://www.filefactory.com/file/e6793d/)
If the attachment file don't work PC:IDX is uploaded to: [http://www.filefactory.com/file/1b0ee9/](http://www.filefactory.com/file/1b0ee9/)
[pc.zip](https://xentaxbackup.github.io/file/1577_pc.zip)

I found a guy who said (about this files):

The game uses tables of string paked into a bigger archive, itself paked into a bigger archive of files, like blizzard's mpq.

But he won't help me...
