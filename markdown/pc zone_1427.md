For those who care: dutch game mag PC-Zone quits before reaching issue *100. Well, they should have listened to the wise ones.

Hehe. Yes. I got an internal mail from IDG where they announced the death of PC Zone and Gamepro. Now some of them will continue working online for Gamez.nl. 

That's what they get if they make the mag a kiddies mag. Kiddies don't read paper, they read the internet. They should have made it a serious and adult magazine, with really deep stuff in there. Because, the 25-40 range of age has grown up with these mags, and probably will still buy a magazine if it is good enough.

Editorial staff probably weren't real gamers. They just don't understand.

The first and biggest mistake they made was not to listen to people like mr Mouse and me who were friendly enough to lend some of our brain capacity to some loudmouths from the Randstad. 

Their second mistake -and thatÂ´s something that holds true for all games mags-was their idiotic approach to bind 'the gamer' to the mag by regulary changing the lay-out, printing colour and the people involved. Oh yesh, we like the readers comments so we doubled the pages to 4!

Their last mistake was to let the people go that cared about the mag like Theo. Other stupid things were the ID-worship (and everybody knows Doom 3 is crap), the errors they made in the hardware-section advices,  the rating of the games (like giving Unreal II high marks, yeah right).

I could not resist but write a reaction at Powerzone on the demise of PC Zone.

Honorable mr Mouse is invited to take a look here:

> Zoals ik al eerder zei, het is makkelijk om achteraf kritiek te komen leveren... het is tekenend dat MrMouse niet meer reageert na zijn opmerkingen hierboven, want zowel ik als enkele anderen hier zouden graag de discussie met hem aangaan! Maar zo blijkt maar weer... (achteraf) kritiek leveren en je gelijk komen halen is heel makkelijk...

Oh really? I do think I actually said in my original post that "achteraf praten makkelijk is". Why is he repeating my own idea and using it as his argument? 

The reason I haven't visited there again after my post to read possible replies is exacly because of that kind of bullshit they will use against me. Which is hardly discussing is it, just fallacious 'reasoning'. I stated I acknowledged that it is easy to criticize after the fact (death of pczone), I also stated that the critics were already alive and kicking years before the demise. Why then attack me using arguments I already used to criticize myself?   

Let them come to me, if they really want a discussion. I have said there what I had to say.
