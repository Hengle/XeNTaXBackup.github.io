I don't put any stock in Nostradamus; his predictions are vague enough that they can be applied to any number of events or circumstances (and (at least according to many people), Nostradamus predicted the end of the world to be in 1999, not 2012, anyways). What you're thinking of is the idea some people have that the world will end on December 12 (or is that December 21? there is actually disagreement!), 2012, because that's when the Mayan long count calendar resets. Supposedly there's some other stuff that lines up with that as well, but it doesn't look to me to hold much water, and even the Mayans didn't seem to attach any significance to the date. This will undoubtedly be just the same as any other doomsdate prediction made in the history of history, though I could see a nontrivial deviation from the norm (whether that would be an increase or decrease, I won't postulate on) in crime levels immediately around the date.
