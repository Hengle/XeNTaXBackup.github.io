- Post Title: Problem with Game extractor

Hey. I wanted to open the Star Wars: Racer model bin file using Game extractor(which was the compatible program acording to wiki), but when I tried it gave a no plugin error. So my question is where can I find this plugin because I really need to view the files in there.

This is the MultiEx Commander forum, not Game Extractor. You should check the Game Extractor website I guess.

Well I'd never knew that Game extractor existed before reading the wiki report located at YOUR site. But if you can't answer my question that's allright I don't blame you.

True, because we ARE not to blame. The wiki was founded by a group of authors of alike tools, Dragon Unpacker, MultiEx Commander and Game Extractor. However, the authors are responsible for their own tools, naturally. 
Watto (author of GE) is a good friend of us, and you will find many posts/plugins by him here, but ultimately for all plugins etc his own site would be your best bet. I've scanned the forum for a plugin matching your criteria and failed to find it. So, I directed you to his site. 

Besides, a wiki being a wiki, anyone can contribute. Thus, you can't expect us to know everything of all of tools that are posted there, eh?
