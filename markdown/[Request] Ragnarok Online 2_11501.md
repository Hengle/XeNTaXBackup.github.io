I hope I can learn technology, also made their own tools like you, this is great work, sharing happy. I looked it up this game in 2009, has replaced the engine, now engine Gamebryo. I found some resources online to help others.nif file format: 20.6.0.0 But this NIF format is not well supported, I hope God can write an import script
