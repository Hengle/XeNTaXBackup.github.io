- Post Title: Perfect Dark Xbla Models extraction

Hello, everyone. I am new to the whole Perfect Dark mapping,  and  modeling But not in general. I was wondering deeply. And I mean deeply, if it was such possible to obtain the models from PD xbla. I'm  came as far as to (I guess) opend the pd xbla file by copying it to a usb drive, and using a program to open the one file with no extension. And came across this file named: "PackedSegFile"... its another file with no extension, but I've read this file contains the maps and, or models data. problem is, how do I access it. Not sure if anyone's attempted such fate. But if you have, PLEASE let me know. I is desperate. (Not really) but it would be nice. 

you can download the containments of what was in the "xbla game file from xbox." If that made sense. So you'll know what I'm talking about.

so far its seems like the Packsegfile needs some major attention.

(Anyway, I'd be surprised if anyone would try to help you out with such a speech...  )

If noone answered it's very likely that noone had a solution. As simple as that.

btw: this is a hobbyists' forum. We are working just for fun not for money.

Cry me a river, some people's requests here go unanswered for months and you have the nerve to throw a hissy fit after one day.
Also the link could've never worked since you couldn't even be bothered to copy it properly ("..." in the middle).

And as shakotay said, I doubt anyone's going to bother helping you with that attitude.

Exactly. You just about nailed it. He has some nerve to call us "bitches" when it was not even 2 days after the topic was made. Hell, I make topics sometimes and they go unanswered and you don't see me throwing a fit over it. Goodness.
