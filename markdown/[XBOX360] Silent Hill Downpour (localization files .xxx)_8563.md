again you need custom application for it. It has been mention on this forum many times, noone helped with xxx files so there is no hope unfurtunately.

please there is really noone who can review the XXX format after decopress? It is readable also possible to extract, but we need to repack this files. Please anyone ??? All U3 games uses this same format. I guess BMS would do it as well. At least export texts and import them back would be enought what we need 

Examples of XXX after decompress.

by the way, day before yesterday this game has been translated into Russian  (presumably release-group from Ukraine), but I could not find what tools used to repack.
