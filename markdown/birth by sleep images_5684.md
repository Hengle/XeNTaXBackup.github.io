not sure if this is the right section or not but here goes
i am doing some 3d models of the armour from KH:BBS and i need some refernce shoots
and i thought i would ask on here for help
i have the 3d models from the game thanks to a very kind member on here but the problem is they are fairly low poly and a lot of the detail is texture details so its not on the model
what i need is as many angles of the armour as possible primarily front, Back, side and very rare but help full shots from above and below.
for example like this: 
all help would be greatly appreciated.
i am mainly focusing on the helmets at the moment for terra, aqua, ven and vanitas and will be doing armour stuff later on
anyone who helps and wants it can have a copy of the model when im finished
thanks in advance
