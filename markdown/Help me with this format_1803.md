DDS file are the regular DDS textures and can be opened and viewed fine. ZMS format not so obvious... obviously , but perhaps more on the subject can be found here

For viewing DDS files, I'd very highly recommend IrfanView, a free general multimedia viewing program. Check out [http://www.irfanview.com](http://www.irfanview.com) if you're interested.
