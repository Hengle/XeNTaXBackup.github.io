- Post Title: Nerf N-Strike .rpk files

While tinkering around the game's data.big file, I notice almost all the files were in an ".rpk" format. I was curious as to what program to open them with, only to find what little data I could find on this filetype was for either some media player or cd ripper. I have the put the following files in the ZIP
Fingerpr.int-Possibly a key for the files or some sort of ID
strap_en_us.rpk-I'm guessing one of those "please put the strap on while playing this game" reminders.
I know it's childish looking at a nerf game, but I found the unique (at least to me) filetype interesting.
