- Post Title: ".bp4" image format help?

I'm looking to work out these .bp4 files. They're from an older anime visual novel called Ikari Shinji Ikusei Keikaku, which I released a translation for earlier in the year, but I'd really like to get these files worked out so I can finish the translation.

Here is an example of one: [https://files.catbox.moe/gxxqvc.bp4](https://files.catbox.moe/gxxqvc.bp4) (File name is ST010000.bp4 if that is needed)
(This is a character sprite sheet I think? This file format also contains menus and stuff which is what I'm looking to work on, I just don't really know which image is which given they're all encoded like that)

They're encoded(?) transparent bmp files.

They seem to be an evolution of another format used in previous Evangelion/GAINAX games called ".bp3", which has an encoding/decoding tool here: [https://gosita.altervista.org/evangelio ... entazione/](https://gosita.altervista.org/evangelion-iron-maiden-2/documentazione/) (Link at the bottom, sorry for italian page, I don't know of any English resources but the readme is in english I think), if this is relevant to anyone, and here's a bp3 file for reference if it would be of use: [https://files.catbox.moe/isi6pq.bp3](https://files.catbox.moe/isi6pq.bp3) (Filename is CLP00105.bp3)

I think the biggest change is that bp4 processes transparency differently. The bp3 encoder/decoder is not compatible with them, or I wouldn't be asking this question obviously!


I have asked in other forums and have used a ton of different image decoding programs and nothing has come of it yet. I don't really know the first thing about hex editing or anything, as is probably obvious  There is also some other stuff in the game's code I need help with, but its not relevant to this board and this is the most important thing.
If anyone can help then thank you! Sorry if this was overly long, I wanted to include as much information as possible so perhaps someone who knows what they're doing can work it out.
