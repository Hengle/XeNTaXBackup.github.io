- Post Title: Noob questions on 3D Model extracting. Yes, I'm new at this.

Hi, I'm new here and fairly new to PS2 Game modding. My first question is if it's possible to extract the models from a game(specifically the Ratchet and Clank series) with it's bones/rigs. I'm not very good at rigging models and I've failed miserably attempting to do so in the past. So I was hoping that it's possible to get the models with it's bones/rigs.

My second question is if it's also possible to get/extract the maps/levels/level models, whatever the proper term is. 

Oh, and correction. Three. Three questions.

My third question requires a bit of an explanation. So, I'm planning and really want to make a Ratchet and Clank hack; the term "hack" is used as it would be used when discussing a Pokemon hack, in other words technically a "fan-made" game. Whatever you want to call it. Anyway, what I'm going to do, or what I want to do I should say, is test it by playing a technically "beta" version on my PS2 to see if it works. I'm going to be doing this because my PC can't run a PS2 emulator without drastically dropping in frames. So the question is, is that possible? I do have FMCB. So I can run a burned game or play a game through a flash drive using uLaunchELF. So, given those circumstances, is it possible?

Any help would be appreciated.

Thanks! I'm actually trying to grab all this stuff from the first four R&C games on PS2 (Ratchet and Clank, Ratchet and Clank Going Commando, Ratchet and Clank Up Your Arsenal and Ratchet: Deadlocked)
I want to get the files from /those./ Just about everything from Deadlocked (mpas/levels, enemy models, player/character models, weapon models, etc) And the other three I'm really just looking to get the map/level models and the weapon models. This project that I'm working on, like I said, is a hack game. The concept of it is basically a round-system survival based mini-game where the player(s) have to fend off against the Deadlocked enemies for as long as they can (kinda like Call of Duty Zombies) just for the fun of it. The reason I mentioned the other three games is because I want to make some of the levels from those games as levels included in addition to the Deadlocked levels. I hope I explained it in a way that's understandable, I tend to have a difficult time doing that.
