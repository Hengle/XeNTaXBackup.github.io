- Post Title: Solid state NEtworks Patcher System Questions

the patcher from Solid State Networks (used for example with SWTOR and Star Citizen (latter in pre-alpha) )resists against the 2 common tips here to get the password out of the process Memory; does anyone know a trick to get beyond it
(asking cause the SC patcher revealed some interesting stuff but i cant progress due to the decrypt issues)
Posting this here cause the launcher guards other game's files, too and sometimes you get a interesting trace by analyzing the updater, too which leads to more juicy files

Edit: syntax
