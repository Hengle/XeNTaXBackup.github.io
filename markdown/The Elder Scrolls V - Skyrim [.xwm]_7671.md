- Post Title: The Elder Scrolls V - Skyrim [*.xwm]

So, Skyrim is finally out!   
Music is in xWMA format, it can be converted to PCM wave using xWMAEncode from X360 SDK.
xWMA specification says that it is WMA frames in different container (RIFF), so the question is: may it be converted to usual WMA without reencode?
Here is the sample - the awesome main theme: [http://www.multiupload.com/JW7MSQKAS9](http://www.multiupload.com/JW7MSQKAS9)

Yes you can. The xwm in the title narrows it down somewhat, but that is not a problem so you go.


Btw. how did you open the bsa files? They don't seem to be the same bsa files as Morrowind

You may use Fallout Mod Manager for unpacking .BSA files.

Here it is: [http://sourceforge.net/projects/fomm/](http://sourceforge.net/projects/fomm/)
