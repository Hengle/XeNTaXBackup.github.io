- Post Title: Need Help with F1 2011 &  NTG:IL Extracting

F1 2011
I have legally purchased F1 2011 on my PC and I am looking to extract car, hauler, driver, helmet, and other models from ti.
I have 3D SimED however I'm running into troubles. I extracted the texture but I have no idea how to extract a file to 3Ds Max.

NASCAR The Game: Inside Line
I have legally purchased NTG: IL for my Xbox 360 and have ripped it using a modded Xbox 360. I am looking to extract models from it.
I have no idea where to start.

Can someone help me via instant messenger or TeamViewer?
I'm new to the modding community and am looking to learn. 

DISCLAIMER
I am looking to learn how 3D models work so I can learn for educational purposes only.
I am not attempting to profit from these in any way or commit any type of crime.

Not all programs let you export in the format you want. so you export as a format you do know of and convert it again..
Im sure 3DSimed can export as DAE ( Collada format ) which can be imported into many different programs, including Max.

Hope that helps.

Has anyone tried quick bms with the NASCAR the Game 2013 for the PC? It is available on steam as a preordered beta.
It looks like the BMS file for NTG 2011 would work but the memory address is different. I imagine is is because of different compile builds changing the memory address.
Does anyone plan to put a BMS file out there for this? I would love to tear through some of the archived files in there.

Regards!
