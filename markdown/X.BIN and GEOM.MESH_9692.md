Can you tell me which program (or game engine) uses this format ?

I uploaded the converted files in Wavefront .obj/mtl formats to my web page:
[http://3dconverter.webege.com/converted ... verted.zip](http://3dconverter.webege.com/converted/wtf_converted.zip)

It loads the geometry + UV datas + materials.

Unfortunately your package does not contain the texture files.

I don't know who are you, but your post seems to be too confused.
Some months ago I renamed my developer directory to the developer_x86.
