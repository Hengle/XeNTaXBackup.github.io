- Post Title: DecUbiSND for AC1 Sound Files - Distorted sound files cutting off

I have the steam version of AC1, and I'm using DecUbiSND to open the .forge files up to listen to various sound files. The absolute majority of the sound files are have an awfully loud static, or they cut off too early.

I'm using Windows 10 btw.
