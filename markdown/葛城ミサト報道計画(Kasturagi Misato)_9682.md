This was a 2009 online game for ps3 called Katsuragi Misato Houdou Keikaku. 
Btw It was not a real game but a a "news program". U played in the rule of  Misato Katsuragi as news anchor who delivers real news with her voice provided by special voice synthesizer software.
Unfortunately the game was only for japan and project stopped on June 5, 2010, almost a year after it launched.
I tried to find it some time ago but with no success. Anyway the 3d model of Misato is really well done.

how much size is the whole game file ?

I can pick a look, but I can't guarantee that I will succeed to decrypt/reverse.

Here is a simple file - [http://yadi.sk/d/hRS9fNik2yy4F](http://yadi.sk/d/hRS9fNik2yy4F)
.dae format, but similar changes.

Didn't have tested yet (3ds max and maya is uninstalled right now), but .dae is not collada format ?

Have you tried to open in 3d modeling/converting software ?

Yes, .dae = collada.
I tried to open in blender, did not work. = (

Another file. most likely it is a model Misato.

Yes its Collada.

I have downloaded and tested quickly on some Collada Viewers but none of them have been able to load any of the models.

I will try tonight with 3ds or Maya.


EDIT: Well maybe the problem come from the .PSSG texture included in this .dae format......
I think we will need to decrypt/extract it before.

I don't think it's a Collada file. As far as I recall, Callada file is a text based format!
it looks like something similiar to (メルルのアトリエ～アーランドの錬金術士3～, Meruru no Atorie: Ārando no Renkinjutsushi 3)

I am interested in Evangelion and I would need about 10 set of files to look into the format!

fatduck, if it's pssg and you don't want to start from scratch you can use my Atelier Totori extractor source code as reference.

I didn't notice this until now!

Anyway, it wasn't a difficult format but deeply nested! so I am trying to use recursive functions to phase them all and get the data I wanted!
So far I am able to get all the geometies and textures from all those sample! The next thing to do will be auto assign materials and textures to the geometries. Then Skeleton!

Here are some pre-view:

hahahaha yeah, you're right, the tree can branch out pretty far. and after 6,000 lines of C++ i said fuck it and i didn't even get to the skeletons lol. might be easier to do in another language like python, but in C++ it was nasty. how many lines of code is your maxscript?

looks good so far!

You're right Chrrox. I know... and this game has just one model, but from the pictures seems that most of the work has been done... maybe someone could give a hand

I had stopped working on this one simply there are only 2 char models and 1 scene model in total!
No worth to figure out the whole thing. 

Unless people had all the DLC. I don't bother to look at it again!
The guy who sent me the files had got all my exported models anyway!

About a year ago I spent some time writing a Blender script for that task… i did not mind about stages but just importing the fully rigged Misato3. 

I hope someone will enjoy.

However, nothing appears to be using the importer

Maybe you are not loading any geometry file. 
A full model consists of 4 files: head, hair and body plus the file with the textures that must be selected for first.

debaser is specified in the script that works on 2.75

Apparently not for me for my 2.76 :/

:Update:
Well, I decided to run Blender via Windows on my Mac. I installed both version of Blender, 2.76 and 2.49. In the newer version, I had the same problem I had in my Mac. It would load empty. Then when I tried to import it on Window's Blender 2.49 I got a script error and the console directed me to this line which was causing the problem:

filter_glob = StringProperty(default="*.pssg;*.dae", options={'HIDDEN'})

The script works even with newer versions of Blender as you can see...

How do I get to this stage in the process from the beginning? 
Thank you.

to show how it works:
"A full model consists of 4 files: head, hair and body plus the file with the textures"

btw: I used Blender249[PSSG][pssg][gz][pgz][2015-01-10] from Mariusz Szkaradek123 to get some dds files from mis_m_AA:

Hi guys. It's been a while..
I didn't even remember the forum URL...
Anyway, if you are still interessed, some time ago I found on a PS3/PSN demo site called brewology the full game package.
Search for "Evangelion". It has all DLCs included and also run in RPCS3 emulator. Still got my script?

yeah, very strange!

```
mmisha_z_AA.dae
PSSG file size:59333
PSSG attribute count:33
PSSG info count:20
then IndexError: list index out of range
```

And I can't debug the script because of not having access to "offset" (always=-1)

```
    if type(offset) is str:
        if type(fmt) is bool:
            extractifsingle = fmt
        fmt = offset
    elif offset != -1:
        self.seek(offset); print(hex(offset))#never met
    result = struct.unpack(">" + fmt, self.read(struct.calcsize(">" + fmt)))
    if extractifsingle and len(result) == 1:
        return result[0]
    return result
```
(This is why I really hate python.  )

btw: extracting those dae.gz files did reveals translation and rotation tables only, so far. Not worth bothering for me.

For stage_a_KK.dae the script didn't crash but blender displays nothing.

stage_a_KK.dae
PSSG file size:18827795

PSSG info count:39

Use Blender 2.79. 
In the import dialog you must select holding the SHIFT key the following .dae (not .dae.gz which are compressed) files:
The resources file. Must always be selected for first. Is the bigger file once extracted (e.g., mis_m_AA);
body geo (e.g., misb_a_AA);
face geo (e.g., misf_a_AA);
hair geo (e.g., mish_a_AA);

I hope it was helpful

used [*.pkg from this site](https://store.brewology.com/demos.php?letters=efgh) (>> Evangelion) and Blender 2.79, still doesn't work.
(misb_a_AA, misf_a_AA, mish_a_AA there are no such files.)

Files are in dev_hdd0\game\NPJB00026\USRDIR\data\graphics\Scenes and have .gz extension so must be extracted.

P.S. Script only works for Misato model (skinned mesh) thus no scene mesh.
