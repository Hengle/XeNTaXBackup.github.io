Hello everybody!

I am working on to make the game translatable. But I am stuck.   

I have the text file, but where the file store the text block data, there are some kind of hash. I could not figure out what. Any Idea? I already used QuickBMS crc check without success.

On the image BLUE is file 1, RED is file 2. The only difference between the 2 versions is only 1-1 character change, like "l"->"L" and "6"->"8".
I could not find any checksum/hash that can reproduce for me these values.

Do you have ANY idea?

Thank you!

The characters you highlighted in red/blue don't look like plaintext

How close are they to the end of the file?
Have you tried checking which bytes in that filehash are actually needed? It could be a timestamp or checksum that the game ignores
