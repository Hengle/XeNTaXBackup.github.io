- Post Title: Questions about Resident evil Umb chronicles and RE darkside chronicles

Hi all. I'm not really sure where to post this but here goes.  I have some questions about Resident evil darkside chronicles HD and RE umbrella chonicles HD.

1. Is there any way to extract the models and textures from the ps3 version?

2. If anyone has done this already, are they slightly improved at all ? 

3. If you have extracted them, can you please share them ?

If anyone is wondering why.  I would love to add it to my collection.
