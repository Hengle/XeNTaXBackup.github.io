- Post Title: P3d.in extractor

Hey, I stumbled across this website called p3d.in link: p3d.in/
There are lots of cool models on there like this one: [http://p3d.in/d06oa](http://p3d.in/d06oa)
So I was wondering if any of you have an extractor or know how to extract?
The models are obviously available somehow because you upload the obj. Then someone can view it.
I would really appreciate it if someone has one, or knows how. (also please give suggestions)
Thanks!

seems like there is a lot information about that format all over the internet, but there is no converter for it

so only hope somebody could help with it

I am not trying to be a pain or anything but how do you do it, and on what browser? I do know what cache is but I just need a little more detail sorry. Also that is a smart idea!

for chrome cache folder is located under this directory:

```
C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\User Data\Default\Cache
```


1. make a link for model you want to get
2. close all tabs in chrome
3. close chrome itself
4. delete all files from cache folder
5. now load you saved link

you'll see a many new files in chrome's cache folder, and your model one of it, perhaps biggest one

Well there is a model I really want. And I just wanted to get it and I wanted to see the textures.
2 things:
*Do I have to be closed out of chrome and then copy the new cache files
*also what did you mean by you randomly renamed them and how did you extract them because they are just files with no specific type

Ok here are some models that I want and I was wondering if you could put them into the sort of format you had and maybe send them? [http://p3d.in/d06oa](http://p3d.in/d06oa)
[http://p3d.in/AJCGX](http://p3d.in/AJCGX)
[http://p3d.in/T4uy2/wireonshadeless](http://p3d.in/T4uy2/wireonshadeless)

Also thank you, you have been a big help. Is there any way I can recommend you on this website?

I could look into their format and see if I can come up with something to view them.
Also if you could do that thing I said it would be highly appreciated.

Here's a python script to convert models from p3d.in into .obj format.

supported:
mesh
uvs

DOWNLOAD:


 convert_me_back_0.2.7z
(2.42 KiB) Downloaded 871 times

you need to get a model with three.js in it header from your browser's cache and rename it to three.js, then put this three.js into the folder where convert_me_back.py is and run convert_me_back.py, after a second you'll get export.obj file.

all credits goes to Mihai The Big Angry Orc, he ask me to post it here and now i'm glad to share it with everybody.

Thanks bro, it works well! On this thread [viewtopic.php?f=16&t=11072](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=11072) "Reinitialized" managed to figure out 2 sites, one of which is p3d. in, although your way seems to keep the .obj file much smaller which is good so thank you for this

Since I make games with Three.js, I will try to help about getting three.js model in you favorite 3D software:

1) - Simply use [Blender](http://www.blender.org/) with the [Three.js exporter/importer for Blender](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/tree/master/utils/exporters/blender) and voila~

2) - For fast rendering or testing rip purpose you can use the [Three.js Editor](http://mrdoob.github.io/three.js/editor/), you will be able to load a json model by selecting import. (you can download the source of the editor [here](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/tree/master/editor).)

3) By making your proper scene in three.js. Look [those tutorials](http://stemkoski.github.io/Three.js/) and make a template scene where you will only need to copy/paste your model.js in a folder, and entering the model name in the page, t's like making you own loader/viewer with your desired settings (light,camera, wireframe etc...)

Hi, sorry for the bump, but has any progress been made with a fixed walkthrough for ripping from P3d.in?

For example. if I wanted to rip [this guy](http://p3d.in/MO5FF/), how would I go about doing that?

I have the script and it seems that there is a poly limit to what this can download it crashes on high poly models on the site. would love it if it could handle more poly.

Hey Tosyk, Sorry to bring up the old topic.

I am trying to download and convert from p3d.in but with no luck.

I ran the python script but i dont see the resulting obj.

Would you know if this method still works after so long?

Thanks!

Actually, I was able to get the script, but it's outdated...

P3D is now using GLTF format with DRACO compression. I was able to convert their bin file to an STL using some online tools and a little bit of hacking to their file format...
