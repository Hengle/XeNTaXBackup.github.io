- Post Title: Atlantis - The Lost Tales for Sega Saturn

Hello.

I'm looking for a way to solve the encryption of the .BIG files of Atlantis - The Lost Tales for the Sega Saturn so I can unpack and pack its ATLANTIS.BIG files (there's one in each CD, the game totalling two CDs), as I would like to perform a localization to this game. It actually consists in importing a dub from the PC version which is not present in the Sega Saturn version, but first I have to solve this issue.

I thought I could do it using the .BIG file encryption of this [thread](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=3555) covering Zero Zone, another Cryo game, but it seems to be totally different. I only need to have the specific encryption of the Sega Saturn version of Atlantis - The Lost Tales as I already have a unpacked version of the PC version of Atlantis - The Lost Tales thanks to the GOG release, which has everything unpacked unlike the original release (it still keeps BIGCDX.BIG files but they are tiny and pretty much worthless, only used for game recognition purposes I guess).

Thanks.
