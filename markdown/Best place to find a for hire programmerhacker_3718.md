- Post Title: Best place to find a "for hire" programmer/hacker

I know the title sounds juvenile - let me preface this by saying that I'm a web programmer by trade, am 30 and have a family.  I'm not a kid begging for help saying "MaEk DiS plugin For $$$$$"   What we're hunting for a "version updater" tool of sorts for the Vicarious Visions Alchemy engine model (IGB) files.  See, X-Men Legends 2 PC (as well as all Xbox/Gamecube XML/Ultimate Alliance games) use Alchemy 3.2.  The Wii uses Alchemy 3.5, which contains some individual animations we'd like to extract, and finally we have one model exporter, however that program uses Alchemy 2.5, which oddly enough works in Ultimate Alliance PC, but not any Alchemy 3.2 games.  So long story short I was hoping to find someone to help either a) research the formats further so that we can hand-swizzle the other versions to work in 3.2's format, or b) have a program developed that does this for us.  We have a fair amount of data on the models themselves in [this thread](http://marvelmods.com/forum/index.php?topic=7.0), and I've also manually searched identical files from different versions and have found large chunks of identical data.  I have no previous experience "paying a hacker" if you will, so I don't know what would be fair.

Anyways, hopefully nobody's offended by my seemingly silly request.
