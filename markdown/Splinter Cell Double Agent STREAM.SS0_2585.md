- Post Title: Splinter Cell Double Agent STREAM.SS0

So since this format is an ogg base format with multiple OGGs in them, then i gues the only way to crack them is to HEX it.

But i don't know the first thing about hexing. Can anyone help em out here?

BTW this is for PC.

The stream.ss0 files can be extracted using Nova Software Extractor. But isn't it that the sound files for the multiplayer are in .ss0 format, not singleplayer? Singleplayer is in .ss2 which can't be extracted (so far), right? Thats where the sound is that I really want.

I'm not having any luck with Nova Software Extractor.
