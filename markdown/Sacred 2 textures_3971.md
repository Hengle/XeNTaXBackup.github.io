Some textures in Sacred 2 can't be modified, looks are compressed, here a example:
[s_menu-3d-floor2_n.7z - 2.58MB](http://www.zshare.net/download/7027135230d0439d/)

Any ideas?
Thanks!!

No ones know how to modify the dds?
All the files  with <<_n.dds>> are "scrambled"
I upload a fresh one, the old is deleted.

i would use a texture capturing program and capture the correct normal map image then just compare them to see what is going on.
