- Post Title: Help ripping from "LET IT DIE"

Hey since this game was ported to PC I was wondering if anybody has any useful information or help ripping from LET IT DIE.

It looks like the game is UE according to google but I don't see any PAK files to get me started. If anyone has any insight it'd be appreciated.
Still pretty new so go easy on me :^)


EDIT: Looks like it has .upk I have no clue if theres a universal tool for this or not but any info would be great!

That's a big game.
I'll help with the samples (.upk): [https://mega.nz/#!PkUhzQiK!9nLiAU5tryd6 ... qCeisp2F3E](https://mega.nz/#!PkUhzQiK!9nLiAU5tryd6eEeA-xBqqBNQ4YH9bxtAYqCeisp2F3E)
Umodel crashes upon opening any of them, so I have no idea whether these are models, but I feel that "AS_CH_Enemy_4HorseMen_SF.upk" has to contain an enemy's model.
Hoping that there is some interest in the game from some of the more experienced members.
