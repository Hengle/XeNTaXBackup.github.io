Hi guys! Here's maxscript to import PC Age Of Wulin Online models with bones+weights (3ds max 2009-2012)

1. Run Age_Of_Wulin.ms
2. Select t_pose.xskt file (bones, it's importand to select t_pose file, since others are animation)
3. Select model file .xmod, you want to import

Done!

P.S. Report bugs, this one will require a lot of testing. I don't have the game, so  I tested only a few models provided by user (thanks for that)

As I said above " I don't have the game", so if you want me to fix something, you should send me all not working model files via PM

Is this is some kind of a joke? I don't know how to react on this. Have you noticed, that all files you uploaded for me are blank and empty?

I downloaded them, open .xmod files in any hex-editor - they are filled with zeros or 0 kb in size. Textures too+bones, I guess extraction process was wrong

Thanks for the great spirit of sharing.
Using the tools developed by the authors, most of the models can be extracted successfully.
There was a problem with face extraction.
Hope to get help!Thank you very much!
PS: Use 3dMax 2014.
