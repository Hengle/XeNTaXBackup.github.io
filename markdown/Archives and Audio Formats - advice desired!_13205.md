- Post Title: Archives and Audio Formats - advice desired!

Hello, one and all! Here is my situation, a bit long-winded sorry....

Like the true chucklehead that I am, I recently decided to obtain the music from every game I own and create a library of this music for personal enjoyment, analysis and posterity. I have achieved this with about 65 games so far, but have now officially had enough of trying to find single-purpose extraction\conversion programmes over and over and over again. The reasons for this are many, as I'm sure you can all imagine.

So in a nutshell, what I want to do is:
1. Be able to extract game files from any archive format put in front of me - old, new or proprietary.
2. Be able to identify audio formats through 'internal' examination and convert them to usable and\or widely-supported formats.
Both of these will likely only be possible with the help of others, of course   

I have a basic grasp of hexadecimal notation, and am already aware of the existence of QuickBMS (and am keen to learn how to use it fully). So my question to all you lovely people is:

What do I need to learn in order to be able to do the above goals?
What base-level software do I need to be familiar with? (Hex editor etc?)

Areas of research rather than details - 'Familiarity with C+', Knowledge of such-and-such, etc. 
Thanks!
