- Post Title: Lost Planet 2 SFX

Hello all. I have used this amazing forum many times over the years but never registered, and now I would like to actually take the time to ask a question   

I have been extracting various LP2 models but I would like to get the SFX sounds of guns/voices/etc from this game. The main music is just .sgnw and playable as is, and map ambience and cutscene audio has no extension but is also playable as is.

However, all of the files that appear to be otherwise SFX are unplayable, and I have no knowledge of how to deal with them. 

Just reading the headers (about as much as I can do) , most are SREQ, XFS (which I do see some information about converting around?), as well as PAC, SEQ, and SPAC (which might be archives?).

Does anyone know anything about converting/extracting the SREQ files? I would really love to get various weapon sounds and voices, but it doesn't seem like anyone ever did.

I've been also looking for a way to access these audio containers, however I have no way of doing so right now, hopefully someone can help out soon.
