- Post Title: Extract a whole Unity scene from a game with textures?

Is it possible to extract a whole scene with textures assigned?

Unity Studio does assign textures, but only around 5%, the others all have a white material.

UABE gives a few combines meshes with only a single material.

So, is it possible without extra texturing/UV mapping?
