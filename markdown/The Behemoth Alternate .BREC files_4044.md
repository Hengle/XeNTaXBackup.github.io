- Post Title: "The Behemoth" Alternate .BREC files

The following files I believe to contain more graphic information and the files I need to complete this whole ordeal. Inside these zip files exist the files I need unraveled. I believe they are similar to the previous .BREC files, in that they may simply need proper trimming and renamig to become a SWF or a similar file. I'm not entirely sure which graphics are in which file though. I can only assume by the names that 'BSP1' contains "Battle Sprites" and the 'Art1-1' contains profile artwork. What I need is a method to convert these into usable format, such as SWF, which I believe these to be altered versions of.

If someone could unfurl these for me, the project will be complete. Thank you for all your help thus far!
