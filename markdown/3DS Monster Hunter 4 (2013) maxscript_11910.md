How did you dump the model files from the rom?

I thought that there are still some decryption issues with them.

use a 4.5 firmware 3ds console and mset exploit + rop loader. this gets you the key (which is typically specific not just to a game, but to the specific card (as in, almost ever game card/image is different, your super mario 3d land will most likely have a different romfs key than mine) you can then use a modified ctr tool to dump it.

This also works with mh4u models too. But I still need the .TEX to convert to a image format. 

Also the noesis script for mh3u wii u doesn't work with every .tex file.

Share some samples for WII U and MH4U .tex. I really don't remember if I did anything with their textures, maybe I did, but I have to recall this xD

Did any of those work or do I need to upload different or more samples? 
Here are some more not working WII U .tex files.

I also want to note that for the Wii U files, some of the textures that do work have strange artifacts in partially transparent areas (such as this one on the wings in the lower half of the texture). This might be because of the conversion, because of the .arc extraction or just a feature of the textures.

Here is an example [https://www.dropbox.com/s/wajsq3uqf1cfw ... M.tex?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/wajsq3uqf1cfwj7/em001_BM.tex?dl=0)
