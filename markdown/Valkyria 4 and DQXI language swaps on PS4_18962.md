- Post Title: Valkyria 4 and DQXI language swaps on PS4

Okay, so as we all know, PS4 hacking is only available on lower firmware PS4 consoles. So that means that only a certain version of some games work based on release date. So far there have been language patches and music restoration patches for the Yakuza series, and I wanted to try and make one for Valkyria Chronicles 4 and for Dragon Quest XI. I own both the Chinese versions but want to add English and Japanese text. The issue I have is that my internet is so slow that a download of each game on pc to rip the files would take 3 days. So I was wondering if someone with bandwidth to spare would upload the language files for me if they could. As a 60gb 6 day download at max bandwidth for a few files at a couple of MB each is not an exciting prospect.

hi there.

I've been trying to do the same with the Pc version but... so far I don't think its realistically possible for Dragon Quest XI.

Its not that dragon quest is using different language, its also a whole different UI, which means all the UI files and UI blueprints in unreal need replacing.
In theory thats simple enough, the real issue is... that there are 2 folders for the UI in dragon quest UI_Common and UI_New (or _international or something like this), and it turns out the international version is using a pretty different file and folder structure, the blueprints have been remade and split into different parts too.

The best bet for this kind of thing with DQXI would be to just literally replace the text and hope if fits in the next text box sizes, which it may not do, i can't say.

I hope that helps avoid a bunch of wasted time though, if you have any progress, please do share it.
Also, the language files for Dragon quest aren't a few mb, they're like 1-2gb, because it includes fonts and other things too, plus the videos which have built in Japanese subtitles. Plus the various battle sound effects for characters.
