- Post Title: Burnout 2 .RWS and .TRA

I'm trying to open up the .RWS files, which are audio, and a file called Traffic.TRA, which contains all the data for traffic vehicles.
Game runs on Renderware, btw.
Here's one of the .RWS files:

And here's the .TRA file:

RWS may stand for Render Ware Sound.

20 views and nothing. I guess it's because this game involves automobiles and is from the 6th gen of consoles, so it's "boring and generic".

Since it isn't "Generic Japanese Role Playing/Panty Sniffing" game #2084068590786057860789 or "Brown 'N Bloom 'N Explosions:The Game" nobody will.

Yeah, WWE 12 and Mario Bros are MUCH more important than this game.
