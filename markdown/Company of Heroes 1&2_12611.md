rgm importer for max : [http://hq-coh.com/forum/index.php?topic=23026.0](http://hq-coh.com/forum/index.php?topic=23026.0)

Edit:2015-02-19

For curiosity i played with rgm and rga format. 
Generally i make importers from zero, don't using others sources. It is for better understanding, how it works and for self teaching.
I prefer Blender version 249. I don't use 3ds max. I  can never  to teach how navigate in this program. Too hard for me.

I had problem with uv mapping. Solution found in rgm importer for max. Really strange format for uv. I think still is something wrong in it.  
Another problem was type 5 for animation. 
type 4 - animation keys : rotation+position
type 3 - animation keys : rotation
type 5 - animation keys : rotatation+position for first frame, but next frames are in special case multiply with values like at offset 19749	
Maybe this type keys is used only for rotated wheels. I don't know.

```

offset 19456	vehicle\hull_stop_fwd  # - animation
offset 19645	(1,) - #used bone count
offset 19649	(96,) - #size of stream data
offset 19653	(24,)
offset 19657	bone:bone_chassis_shaker - #bone name used for animation
offset 19681	(5, 6, 0, 72) - #type animation , frame count, stream off start, stream off end
offset 19697	(1.0,) - #long animation in sec 
offset 19701	(0.0, -2.6865682801243546e-16, -0.0, 1.0, 0.021946858614683151, 0.0027103796601295471, 0.0013075463939458132, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, -1.794927534916057e+38) - initial key ?
offset 19749	(0.0, -2.1273346576163537e+19, -4.6566125955216364e-10, -1.6862942859182034e-34, -444019758858240.0, -2.0372400283813477) - strange values = float32*frame count
offset 19773	(0.0, 0.13333334028720856, 0.26666668057441711, 0.40000000596046448, 0.66666668653488159, 1.0) - frames




```


Well. Here is what i have done.
How use:
1.Unpack all sga archives and joint all art folders.
2.run Blender249.blend - not open in blender.exe only click on blend file
3.in Blender Text Window press alt+p and select:
- rgm files - textured and rigged models
- delete unnecessary objects and make parent  all meshes to "pose" armature
- rga files - unpack all animations to new folder 
- anim files - for animation

Updated: 2015-02-21:
- rgt - convert to dds format

Noob question,

How can I import .rgm to the blender and see the textures and rigged models?
alt+p then import .rgm does do anything.
