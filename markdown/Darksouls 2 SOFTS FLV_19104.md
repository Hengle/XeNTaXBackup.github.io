- Post Title: Darksouls 2: SOFTS FLV

Hello people! First time posting. I am currently trying to find the Jester set in the DS2: SOFTS files while I would be able to do this given time, I am missing the max scripts for a proper importing of the flv files. as currently my 3dsmax importer script has the vertexes all over the place. if anyone has a copy of this script or just the jester's set models and textures it would be great.

Example of what my current script does and copy of the script I am using.

Model sample? I was helping one user to get some weird thing in 3d from DS, might help you as well, since I had to return to this game anyway.

While I don't know currently what Cxxxx has the jester's set if you have some system to get models imported correctly I can find it.

Well, if it's not the set you want - this is bad. I'm not planning to fix script for various files if not all, atm. Just help someone since I had to do it, for other person and with same game

Okay, here you could you this script (bones disabled), not promise it will work or it will spoil other models. Note for everyone who may download it, it's a temporary solution just for this particular example!
