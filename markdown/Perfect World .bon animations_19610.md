- Post Title: Perfect World .bon animations

Hi guys,
i need some help with old .bon files of perfect world. There are bone animations inside of it, but i can only import the .ski and .bon files without animations. 

Someone wrote an import script for 3ds max 2009, but it dont imports animation data. I added a sample and the import script for bon file.
Can someone help me please?
