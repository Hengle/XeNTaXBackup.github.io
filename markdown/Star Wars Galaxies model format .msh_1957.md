- Post Title: Star Wars Galaxies model format? .msh

Hi all,

Looking for a way to view SWG models extracted from .tre files. Anyone know of a viewer/editor that I can import these into?

Filename is *.msh

Header from the file:

FORM Ã¦MESHFORM Ã¥Ã¶0005FORM   Â¥APPRFORM   â„¢0003FORM   `EXBXFORM   T0001FORM   (EXSPFORM   0001SPHR       Ã„k>Ã°â€¦]?Å½Â

I see FORM stamp which could indicate Lightwave *.lwo format? Could you post the file?

Then scroll down the page untill you get to the 3rd party plug in's... you will find 2 for swg .msh and .mgn files.  No support for animation atm

I added the Star Wars Galaxies .msh loader module to the 3D Object Converter and I uploaded the latest developer package (non beta) to my web page.

You can download it using the following link:

I converted any original .msh files into .Wavefront's .obj/mtl format:
