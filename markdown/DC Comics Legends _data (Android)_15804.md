Hi guys,I need help extracting the models from the DC Legends game.
I tried Unity Studio,and UABE,but Unity Studio can't extract contents of files which was decompressed by UABE (files do not load)
Samples are here: [https://mega.nz/#!Kx4EzDyK!LIOwFY-_Bhlu ... R0ifizxxkk](https://mega.nz/#!Kx4EzDyK!LIOwFY-_BhluA0RGF3sx6klBqjP3Q8yyIR0ifizxxkk)
Thanks in advance!
P.S Btw,someone managed to rip models from this game,so looks like this is possible,i need just to know how.. [http://datkofguy.deviantart.com/art/DC- ... -657229037](http://datkofguy.deviantart.com/art/DC-Legends-Wonder-Woman-Champion-of-Amazons-657229037)

they rooted/jailbreak one phone then shared the downloaded data. You unlock the models only by playing the game.
