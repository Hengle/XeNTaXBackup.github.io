- Post Title: Ripping animations from fifa street 2

Fifa street 2 is a ps2 game... I have got the .iso file for it which runs on a ps2 emulator fine. I have used quick bms to further extract .big files from it. I see more weird file formats which i don't understand.... i wanna extract all the animations for the football tricks. I have no experience in it and all the stuff I read online talks about extracting textures or models only whereas i mainly need the animations. Can someone help me with it? 

Thanks for your time!
