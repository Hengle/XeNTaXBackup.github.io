- Post Title: Yu-Gi-Oh!! Tag Force Models (.tms)

I'm looking to convert some of the models from Tag Force 6, but so far I haven't had a lot of luck working with the format so I was wondering if anyone could help me out? I've uploaded a sample file here: [https://sta.sh/016zjji89ch3](https://sta.sh/016zjji89ch3) 

If anyone would be willing to help out, I'd really appreciate it
