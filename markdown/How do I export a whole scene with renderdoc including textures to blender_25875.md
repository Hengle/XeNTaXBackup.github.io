You can't, that isn't the purpose of RenderDoc.
You're better off using something like NinjaRipper2.

if you are looking for certain geometry,(doesnt grab textures)  you create the CSV file (you can create one with the little save icon when in the mesh viewer) and use the import_pix1.py script on blender [https://github.com/sbobovyc/GameTools/b ... ort_pix.py](https://github.com/sbobovyc/GameTools/blob/master/Blender/import_pix.py) you install it just like any other script.
i use a custom variation for a particular game (this may not work depending on whatever game/program/executable you want to extract these from)
you may need to change the code.
