maybe you should try over here

[http://www.facepunch.com/forums/44-Model-Skin-Requests](http://www.facepunch.com/forums/44-Model-Skin-Requests)

If you haven't notice models are not posted here at all. just hacking studies and sometimes tools. plus this is not a request section.

They are the actual models, just with bone implants.

You cannot download them, they are just JPEG images.

EDIT: nvm, you had to register to download.

I found a site where you can download BBS models.

in the rar files:
708_p11ex00_00.png (Texture)
708out.obj (The model itself)
708out.smd (some wierd blocky thingy)

I import them in 3DS max.
It gives me these errors:
matlib not found ''C:/User/XXXX/Desktop/KHModels/VentusArmored/rdmexport.mtl
Material 708material_00 not found

First: what the hell is rdmexport.mtl, i can't find it on the internt
Second: The material isn't called 708material_00, even when i change the texture name to 708material_00 it doesnt find it.

I get this bad quality, nontextured, tiny model

can sombody help me regards to this?

Thank you
