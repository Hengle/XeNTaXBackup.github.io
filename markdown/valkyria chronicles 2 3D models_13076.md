Hello hello every one, I have been working with the valkyria chronicles models for a while now, having fun rigging them and making my own personal mods so I can continue to have more valkyria chronicles. Now I have started a new project, I unpacked the CPK file in the valkyria chronicles 2 Iso, there was a CPK file called ODIN.CPK, the quick BMS script worked on it and extracted MLX and MXE files, both model files of valkyria chronicles, how ever import valkyria script 0.6 won't work on them, a shame. I am a proficient modeler, but my skill stops there and coding is beyond me, would someone be able to figure out how to open these MLX files in Blender? I will upload some random MLX and MXE,HTX data for you to test.

The rar file is

If you used my bms script it wil not work on this game to get correct files.

I used the BMS script that worked on VC 1, and it pulled out all of it's files even splash art and sounds. The Rar file contains the models and textures that need an import script to be opened.

if this is the script you are using
[download/file.php?id=5643](http://forum.xentax.com/download/file.php?id=5643)
this will not work.
i hard coded the file table the files extracted will be garbage on any other file.

Hm, that is odd. the other files that BMS script pulled from the CPK are intact, at least they look to be, but the CPK file is tiny, I know its just a PSP game, but the file is tiny, and there is nothing else in the ISO that could contain the data, and the files extracted form the CPK all have the right file type and names, they are line up with each other, i figured ou that VC_VA(random numbers here) meant it was a main character model, and with the files it links to that to.  here is a link to the CPK, you can see for yourself.

you need to use CriPackedFileMaker.exe to extract the cpk file.
But the files are encrypted after that.
if you want a set model i recommend using the psp emulator to grab it.

I tried that, but the models are in very complicated poses when ripped, it seems the ripper extracts the model in it's current pose in time. Is there any way to decrypt the files once i get to them?
