- Post Title: Thunder Force VI .gmo models

I've managed to successfully extract the data from the game files (in this case PLAYER0x.BIN files since I'm looking for the player ship models), but I need help at converting the .gmo models into obj since the .gmo format used is different to the .gmo format used on PSP.

The extracted .gmo and .tm2 files are in the attachment.

strange format - vertex data (maybe animation data?) is interrupted by sequences with 15 zeroes.

I used the new autocreation feature for face indices of hex2obj 024d for claw from Syrinx folder:

Nice. Any progress on this?
