- Post Title: FIFA 14/13: .SBR- and SBS-files

Hi,

I want to extract the Soundtrack of FIFA 14 (PC-Version) to listen to the awsome music. I already extracted the Music of FIFA 11 and FIFA 12. The extraction of the .sps-files from the .big-files was very easy. But in FIFA 14 I only found a eatrax-folder in the .big-files with this content:

```
eatrax.ptc.dbg [6 KB]
eatrax_01.sbr [1 KB]
eatrax_01.sbr_debug [1 KB]
eatrax_01.sbs [42.513 KB]
eatrax_02.sbr [1 KB]
eatrax_02.sbr_debug [2 KB]
eatrax_02.sbs [157.975 KB]

```


Is there a way to extract the sound files?

Yours,

Wlanowski

Can you tell in which big file you found them (fifa 14 please)? I can take a look, see if i can recognize any known compression method.
