- Post Title: Z from the Bitmap Brothers

Hi everyone!

Could you please look into this game?

[http://www.fromheaven.de/Z_SPRITES.RSC.rar](http://www.fromheaven.de/Z_SPRITES.RSC.rar)

The Original File is 3,71MB, the file should contain all the Sprites from the Game

A Demo is available here:

Many Thanks!
