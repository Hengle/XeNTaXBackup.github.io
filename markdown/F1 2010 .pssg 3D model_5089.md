Hi, Codemasters released new game - F1 2010.
Of course, they are models. This is a .pssg file with geometry of car: [http://www.speedyshare.com/files/244062 ... ghLOD.pssg](http://www.speedyshare.com/files/24406270/re0_highLOD.pssg)

i too would love to get some of these car models without having to resort to DXripping them.
So if anyone could take a look at the file CityPoke912 posted and possibly knock up a cheap and dirty extractor/converter for the model and textures that would be awesome.

( oh BTW citypoke i also answered your question in the Forza thread regarding textures )

Can you save it in .3ds and upload it on a speedyshare.com? 
My 3DSim Demo has expired.

@adk
Can you try to open map files f.e. from F1 2010\tracks\circuits\Spa_Francorchamps?

yeah i can confirm Cars, Interiors ( the steering wheel ) and Tracks are all importable in 3dsimed. Cars will have to have the textures reassigned manually, but the wheel and tracks will auto assign them. 
Im having a few problems with a couple of other files tho. In the " characters/models " folder there are a load of pssg files named things like " bodyjenson_button". 
If i try loading them into 3dsimed as objects it is totally blank, but if i expand the pssg with 3dsimed it will dump out all the textures for that model ( in the case of the above file it gave me the textures for J buttons racing suit) 
So far i havnt been able to find a single file in that folder that loads they all seem to be just textures ( which seems odd that they are in a "models" folder ). 
Has anyone had any luck loading any of these models (or are they just texture packs and the models are somewhere else ??)

Thanks for confirming that Tosyk.  At least now we know what we can and cannot load into 3dsimed.
