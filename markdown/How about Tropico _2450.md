A few files might help, I'm not too sure about the game tbh O_o. I've heard about it.

Some time in the past I have managed to unpack game's 2 x PK2 files  some 360 MB heavy. But kill me, I do not remember now what was that I used to unpack them. 
Anyway, after unpacking there are over 2000 TRO files in each bin. They are different size and probable contain different things.   I have zipped some at random here:
