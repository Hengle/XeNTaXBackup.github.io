I am completely clueless what to do. I have Megaman Legends Pc and am trying desperately to mod it. The game consists of .BIN files and .wbk(wavebank) files.

I found Mirex's unmass and Bitturn. Unmass could extract the bins, although incorrectly, but Bitturn recognized the .TM files it produced as megaman legends pic.

Here is all the known info

Maybe someone can offer help as to how to properly extract and reinsert the texture data for this game. Thanks for your help.

Ask chiz to post the link to his wiki.
It doesn't look like he explained the BIN archives very well in that image.
