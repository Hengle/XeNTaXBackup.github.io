OWW! My mistake! (who else's?   )

Anyway, problem solved! It will work now! Try it!

The thing is, you were right to opt for webbased format script downloads. As you run MultiEx Commander, and select to open DFBHD files, it will retrieve the script it needs from the web. In essence from XENTAX. Ok? Now here's what went wrong. It turns out that the program asked for the script from the server, but the server did not give it. Don't ask me why, cause it is rather, uh, my own fault. Suffice it to say, it will work now. 

Meanwhile, you could have selected to open the files using the off line formats that are saved on your hard disk (they came with the package). 
But this is inadvisable, as webbased scripts should (as it turns out "in theory") be most up to date.   

Oh well, it works now! Thanks to your post here!

I have a similar problem. I try to open the _files.pff (BHD), but get an "unable to open" error and then the program terminates. I have the newest version, it updates from your site etc. The older version I had (3. could open the file but not extract without an error though.

Thanks

Does this problem occur with other PFF files , or only with the "_files.pff"?
Also, in the MultiEx Commander/data/config directory you will find a pff.bms file. Get it just when you recieved the error. And then send it to me please. Send it to [mr.mouse@xentax.com](mailto:mr.mouse@xentax.com). Thanks.

Hi again. There is no PFF.bms file in the ...\multiex\data\config folder. Today the program failed to download definitions from your site and I actually opened the file but still got an error and the error repeated every time I tried to do something with the files.

---

C++ error

Debug Assertation failed!

Program ...\multiex\data\fwr.exe
file: fopen.c
line 53

Expression: File != null

---

I'll try later and see if multiex connects and then give you more info.

Well just now multiex connected fine and it seems it's only _files.pff that is causing problems.

The thing is I'd like to create a mod making weapons handling and gameplay in general more realistic. I extracted a weapons.def file from another pff (localres.pff), but no luck reading it. Finding info on DF modding is very hard though... so if anybody reads this and know some tricks... please let me know

Okay. Good. And if you get this problem again, perhaps you should switch the connecting off in the options menu, and try again. But I will see what that error is.
