you have to drag and drop the .hvp file on the unhvp.exe file to extract/unpack it

By any chance could this same program unhvp be modified for obscure 2 files to read the hvp files of Obscure II: The Aftermath as well. the other obscure.hvptool here on the forums is incomplete and useless. instead or reversing the files it just converts every single original format file into .dat format. i extracted all audio and video (cutscenes) assets without that useless program. this unhvp for obscure 1 is good as it uses file handling. by any chance is there a program for modding obscure II as well? that extracts DATAPACK.hvp file into the original format of the files inside?

Try this:

Hello, how can I compress, merge the folders in .hvp again?

My research on Obscure 1 HVP files
[http://wiki.xentax.com/index.php/Obscure_HVP](http://wiki.xentax.com/index.php/Obscure_HVP)

And my script for exporting/importing files from HVP archives
[https://github.com/bartlomiejduda/Tools ... script.bms](https://github.com/bartlomiejduda/Tools/blob/master/NEW%20Tools/ObsCure/Obscure_HVP_script.bms)

you can use it with quickbms [http://aluigi.altervista.org/quickbms.htm](http://aluigi.altervista.org/quickbms.htm)
Read more about "reimport mode" here [http://aluigi.zenhax.com/papers/quickbms.txt](http://aluigi.zenhax.com/papers/quickbms.txt)

As far as I know, it should work ONLY with Obscure 1, because Obscure 2 seems to have completely different file format.

Edit: It also works with XBOX version of the game

Works perfectly for Obscure 1 steam! But it didn't work for Obscure 2 steam...
Do you know any way how to extract Obscure 2 files?
Thx

Hi, my script shared in my previous post here is for Obscure 1 ONLY. I've tested it with GOG (PC) version and with XBOX version.
If it works with Steam version - even better.  No need for adjustments then.


As for Obscure 2 - file format is different, so it needs more research to create working script/tool.
I'm trying to figure out how this "new" file format works. Keep an eye on Obscure 2 topics on this forum, when I'll find something useful, I will defenitely share it on the wiki and on the forum as well.

I know that this is topic for "Obscure 1", but there were some comments about "Obscure 2" as well, so that's why I'm sharing this here:

My research on HVP archives from Obscure 2 --> [viewtopic.php?p=188831#p188831](https://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?p=188831#p188831)
Links to extractor and file format are shared there. I hope that it will be helpful to someone.
