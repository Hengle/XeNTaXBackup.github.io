Hello, I am new to the forums 

I would like to know wether there's any way to play or convert to AVI the video files from Cryo Interactive games. I can upload one of these if needed.

Thanks!

I already tried MPlayer, which I believe uses ffmpeg or is somewhat related to it? It didn't worked at all...

I uploaded a hnm video from the trailer of Atlantis II, including the original application attached as a player. I have some other stand-alone players around if you're interested.

mikehood, I've read all those specs, but they sound like Chinese to me. I was asking for an already existing way to convert them
