Hi! Anybody can extract tracks from NFS Porsche 2000? Zmodeler can't open this. Thanks!

So is possible to make one click converter? I just need only objects of tracks without UV, smooth.

It's very old game so I understood models isn't needed. Method using Ninja Ripper/DX Ripper didn't work or Idk how to correct do this with this game.

Scrap Studio

[https://we.tl/t-cJ8444y1gz](https://we.tl/t-cJ8444y1gz)

I'm not sure if it will work on modern computers, I used it with Win2000 and WinXP. I know ZModeler 1.xx still works, but if everything else will work, I have no idea.


Also, for locked files, ask the person who made the mod, the whole reason it's locked is so people don't steal their work

I know that's how someone else converted a track, it just... is painfully slow, and I don't know if it will work with modern computers, which says a lot about when the software was made and wasn't really available

Hey man, do you still have scrap studio? If yes, could you send a permanent link here, thanks.
