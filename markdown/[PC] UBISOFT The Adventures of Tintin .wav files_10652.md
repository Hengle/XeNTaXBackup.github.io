- Post Title: [PC] UBISOFT The Adventures of Tintin .wav files

Hi all,

I managed to extract the .bf archive that contained the music of Ubisoft's The Adventures of Tintin: The Secret of the Unicorn using the guide posted earlier here, but I can't manage to convert the .wav files that contain the music using any program (ww2ogg, Ubisoft sound decoder, vgmstream...). When I open them in... well... Wordpad, I can see the files have a RIFF WAVE header, and they contain OGG data. Can anyone here please help me with this? Do I have to post a sample file, or a screenshot of the file opened with a hex editor?

I extracted the music from the PS3 version as well, but those files show no sign of OGG data - just the RIFF WAVE header.

Thanks in advance.
