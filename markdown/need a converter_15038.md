I believe VGMStream converts this format last I tried: [https://www.hcs64.com/vgmstream.html](https://www.hcs64.com/vgmstream.html)

Edit: Whoops you're right

He wants to go the other way, vgmstream only outputs PCM.

I believe the original SDK encoder for these tracks is called dtkmake or trkmake, maybe you can find that somewhere online.

edit: I won't link directly to it here, but it looks like emuparadise has it, in GameCube.7z it's "NINTENDO GameCube SDK 1.0/X86/bin/dtkmake.exe".
