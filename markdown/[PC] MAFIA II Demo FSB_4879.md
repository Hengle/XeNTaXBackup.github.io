- Post Title: [PC] MAFIA II Demo FSB

Musics are in "FSB" files. i used fsbext.exe to convert these FSB files to WAV with and without selecting options like -a -A etc.
Also I added XMA RIFF Headers with different sample rates and channel counts and used toWAV.exe to decode them. But they were not decoded properly by toWAV.
What did i do wrong?
Thanks for helping!

Little bit off topic, but if you want to listen/convert them you can use Music Player Ex [http://jerome.jouvie.free.fr/Fmod/Projects/Project1.php](http://jerome.jouvie.free.fr/Fmod/Projects/Project1.php)

Weird. I used it for converting to mp3. All of the Mafia 2 music.
Doesn't matter

Fsb_mpeg works.
But all the radio music in Mafia 2 is only in 96kbit and mono.
Only the main theme has a slightly better quality with 128kbit and stereo sound. =/

Just a random note because i couldn't keep my fingers away, 96kbit mono is actually "better" quality than 128kbit stereo,
since each channel in the 128kbit stereo file would use 64kbit each to come up to the 128kbit quality. TE HE.

okay, i crawl back under that rock again.
