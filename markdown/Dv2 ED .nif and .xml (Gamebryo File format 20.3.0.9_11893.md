- Post Title: Dv2 ED .nif and .xml (Gamebryo File format 20.3.0.9

Hello together.
I started today with the try to change some files in Divinity 2: Ego Draconis and found here the two .exe files for packing and unpacking the .dv2 files. After unpacking all files, I first wanted to look inside the files, thought that they are openable with Text editors/Scripting programs ('cause of the ending .xml) and then I had to determine, that the files are not viewable with "normal" tools like Notepad++ and Scriptly. 
I was searching for an program which is able to open files with the Gamebryo File format 20.3.0.9 and found NIFSkope, tryed to open it, but it tells me that it can't load the Header (Why ever). Now I'm looking for a program which can open these files and is able to write in them.

Note: The original thought was it to change some settings of the engine like render distance and so on. Maybe someone knows how to do it.


Greetings,

Mahagon

(Keep in mind that the following information is older than 2 years. Meanwhile new possibilities might have arosen.)
"for handling of model data: NifScope 1.0.22 (in my experience actual versions such as 1.1.0-RC5 do not work)"

I explained extracting of nif models here:

Hi I tested the script, NIF model file cannot be imported, import only the skeleton.
