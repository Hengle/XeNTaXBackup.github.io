- Post Title: Maxscript Animations

Hello, i can't seem to find out how to load animations into max using maxscript.

Can someone post an example code of how to load animations with maxscript or a link to a maxscript importer with animation support that's released here.

I'm still a newb with coding and maxscript in general, i just need a basic understanding of how it "works" with maybe a lil basic code snippet.

P.s. i know it needs position,rotation,scale,bonenames and ofc frames, i'm just clueless how to load them. xD




Thank you.
