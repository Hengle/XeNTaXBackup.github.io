- Post Title: FIGHT NIGHT CHAMPION GEOM Files?

Hi, I am trying to export the mesh and texture files from Fight Night Champion. The mesh comes in a GEOM format. I have seen many forums say to use the 3D Converter app but, it seems like it doesn't open. Is there another way to convert the GEOM to OBJ/FBX?

2 years ago I updated my 10 years old EA Sports Fight Night Champion .geom loader module and I tested it on the models I got from other users like the attached sample file.

Here I attached the converted file to avoid the attachment file size problem.

The mesh comes in a GEOM
I quickly made a plugin without parsing the format, (keyword search). Mesh and UV.
