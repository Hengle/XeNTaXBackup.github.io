I tried registering an account, but it's painful and I can't get past the iPin or whatever.

Soooo, I tried the other way and I get this error:



No idea wtf this says.

Any thoughts?

Can someone send me ONLY the file name and path of the examples in this post?
I think that the launcher it's not downloading all the files, I have many with 0 size in the folder Data. And the only models to view are simple mobs.

Sorry for posting on an old thread. I have recently been researching Vision Engine.
Most of the time the animations are havok pack(or Tag) files which are not available in Havok Studio, but have been converted successfully!
Successful examples include Sword Legend 3, Sword Legend Online, and 仙侠世界2.

Most likely, since this game is also Vision Engine, it can be converted. If anyone has a client and is interested in animating please PM me.

*EDIT
Only some files, file was provided. The game is on the Vision Engine, but it was a completely normal havok file, probably because it is an older game.
Some files are normal havok files, but some need to be modified. Also, it seems that the naming conventions for characters and animations are not always set properly.
