Imagine it like lego/Pottery/Ikea assembling. You can get something nice outta all 3 of them with an absolut Minimum skill (that would be the blender Donut tutorial by blender guru for you....he shows you "everything" in 3 parts...leaving you with enough skill to get started).
Itll be like Pizza....theyll get better once you make a few

If you want to watch someone who just gets down to what you have to do since you don't have a lot of time then watch Arrimus 3D (for Max). He also did some Blender tuts. Modelling takes a while to learn and is not something you can ever fully learn, there's new technologies and workflows every day, which is what keeps it interesting.
