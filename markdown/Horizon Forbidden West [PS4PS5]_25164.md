Horizon Forbidden West tool.

There are versions for PS4 and PS5.
Extracts all (or almost all) characters/robots with skeletons, animations and textures, also static meshes.

xentax only allow 256k files, so get it here: [https://github.com/iddaemon/h2_extr](https://github.com/iddaemon/h2_extr)

Tests are ok so far, most of the models work fine.
Currently working on placing destructible parts for robots, and then the tool will be complete and released.

Horizon Forbidden West will NOT be released on PC in the nearest years.

So this tool is for PS4 and PS5.

Everyone needs to stop posting thank you's/excitement spam messages instead of using the thumbs up button, that's what it's for, refrain from spamming, tool hasn't even been released and you guys are making this thread a mess, rules are rules, to keep things organized try to think about that through out entire forum and no more whole quoted posts too, just saying.

Ill post this here too for everyone trying to get the textures working properly it requires a good deal of nodes. Hopefully revetix will be able to build some kind of tool allowing you to plug in material info and it give a correct map. 

If not this will require "baking" of all these textures somehow in blender or your 3D application. He did a test on the file above using this configuration.
[](https://ibb.co/dgsYNc7)

Hopefully something can come from the info and we will be able to get textures working correctly. Still very mind blowing to see this kind of technique used and the quality achieved from it.

Tool released.

The process of extracting models is complicated, especially getting robots with all destructible parts.
I will try to provide information on it as soon as possible.

Unfortunately, its still impossible to post a file thats bigger than 256kb here, so its released on zenhax.

I'm going to start explaining the situation and what can we do about it.

First of all, data layout in this game is totally different from previous decima games.
Assets are not organized in any logical structure, and have no names. There's no such a thing like assets for characters, any specific character or robot, they are not grouped in folders with textures, models, or shaders. Nothing like this.

Instead, they are all grouped in so called "Streaming Graph".

As I understand, it was done for optimization purposes, so the game can load/use all of the assets (and there are millions) in the best way possible in terms of speed/memory usage. As a result, its hard to get anything from there. Especially considering there are almost no names anywhere.

There are 18 main big packages containing about 75000 asset groups. Then each group has individual assets inside. Groups are very different in size. One of them may have a 1000 of assets, and another one - only a few, or even one single asset. And all this is split weirdly. For example, we may have one big part of a robot in one group, and a small part of his left leg in another. Textures/skeletons may also be scattered around other groups, seemingly without any logic.

So what i did is a scan of all asset groups for skeletal meshes, and recorded their numbers. Then i searched for specific data/strings inside, and split them into 4 parts: character heads, aloy outfits, robots, and those that left. The ones left seems to have most other enemies, npcs and characters. I'm adding these lists here.

Also note Aloy's head is ABAA, her long hairs is 6AA8, skeleton/eyes/teeth is 710.

Now current tool usage is very simple.
Change path in INI file to your files location, make sure oo2core_8_win64.dll is in the same folder. If you dont have version 8, use 7 or 6, just rename it. Once all done, run the tool with 1 parameter: asset group number in hex:

h2_extr.exe <number>

For version 1.00 these numbers are from 0 to 126e4 (which is 75492 decimal).

example: h2_extr.exe 00AF5
or h2_extr.exe 00af5
or h2_extr.exe af5

Tool will export textures as DDS and models as ASCII. If present, skeletons will be exported in separate files, so you have to copy-paste them to models (as it was done before for horizon 1).

During export, you can see which skeletons are used by each mesh in this form:

Mesh with skeleton 710 16

That means that skeleton is in group 710, asset 16. If thats the same group, it will be already exported. If its another group, you will have to extract that group to get the skeleton (if it was not done before).

After a few days of nodes and some help from daemon and revetix we were finally able to get a system set up to properly bake these textures. 
It does require many nodes/channels to get the map. But once its all set up you can easily transition between colors. There is no other way to get these baked maps that I know of. 
[](https://imgbb.com/)
I know this isnt perfect and still needs fine tuned but still you can see here we were able to plug in the proper RBG channels to bake somewhat of a diffuse map. All material id's would do is point you to the correct textures that mesh is using. It wont fix this part of the work that needs to be done. This will have to be done inside of your 3D application. 
Huge thanks Daemon for all the effort you put in on this one. I know you cringe at that hair screenshot I cant see what else im missing. Maybe i need a different hair mesh all together i seen there were 2 maybe I deleted the correct one. Please don't hate me  I even redid the mesh entirely just to see if i had misplaced the hair and it is indeed the correct one. There is a flat looking one and a more filled hair and the only one that fits with his helmet is that hair. So this has to be right. 
[](https://ibb.co/N9CdMhy)
ALSO
Many of these textures use B channel for AO and sometimes alpha. So once you have baked maps properly use photoshop or something to pull B channel from the image and use it in the baked image.
[](https://ibb.co/D4YdJbr)
It takes awhile to do one but once you have everything in place its not that bad to get a fully functioning model.
[](https://ibb.co/pb3g6h2)
You can also use Unreal Engine to directly manipulate textures then bake them inside of that too. Which ever way works best for you. Here is the results of that method.
[](https://imgbb.com/)
This is what the node setup would look like:

Tool updated.

1. More asset groups supported, now only 14 of 75000 groups crash.

2. Material output.

Each model will now export "..._materials.txt" file with a list of all materials used. Also ascii file itself will have material numbers inside as a name of each submesh.

Materials will be exported to "materials" subfolder as individual files. Each file may contain several material sets. For each material there will be list of texture numbers + variables. Sometimes these variables contain important data, such as solid colors and other shader constants. Texture numbers may be either exact texture number (corresponding to texture file names exported) or texture set number. In this case you will have to guess texture numbers, because this info is not yet exported. Also some textures are not present in any sets. These are not exported yet, so you can't use them.

3. animations.

Only morpheme animations supported, which are used only for Aloy, npcs, and only one robot - mole.
These are group numbers containing them:
6b0a - aloy
99c - npcs
a935 - mole

Once exported, you will get all animations as in horizon zero dawn tool.
Unlike 1st game, forbidden west has no physics skeletons (which i used for animations), so you have to use mesh skeletons. Tool now exports these in both ASCII and SMD for this purpose.

Hello all,

I just stumbled upon the fact that you can apparently pull models from games and I think that is awesome and it is some amazing work you're all doing.  

I'd like to learn/attempt to pull the machine models from Horizon Forbidden West.  I'd like to try and 3d print a few for my bookshelf as decoration.  

Is there anywhere that I could consult or read about how to use the software that daemon1 has created?  I'm willing to hit my head against a wall for a few hours figuring it out if I have something to at least consult.  Like how to connect the program to the PS4.  Any guidance would be really appreciated.

Or if anyone is feeling super generous and would like to share the machine models they extracted I would be incredibly grateful too.  

Thanks, everyone!

-Stacy

This is meant to be run on PC, and the instructions are right here in this thread.  The biggest issue is finding the game files to work with.  So far, it looks like HFW hasn't been dumped yet, so very few people will have those files (mainly those who were able to get the development version that leaked a while back).

It's not the development version at all, it's a legit dump using a private PS4 exploit working on the latest firmware. So you need to know someone from the PS4 scene.

I will try and make a readme how to get edge animations soon.

Tool will now export .edgeskel skeletons and .edgeanim animations for that purpose.
Then it needs to be exported to text with leaked sony edge tool.
Then you can convert it to SMD with a simple tool i made (edgetosmd.exe included in release).

- Post Title: Re: Horizon Forbidden West

Time to explain the most complicated part, robots.

First, I will describe all assets needed. All of them were present in horizon 1, but now we also need EDGE assets. To get full animated robot, we will need ALL of these. And they could easily be in many different asset groups (groups described in a post above), or all in one. Which complicates things.

This is a list of all robot assets used in extraction:

1. Models:
- main model
- additional models (antennas etc)
- destructible parts

2. Skeletons:
- mesh skeleton
- physics skeleton
- edge skeleton
- SkeletonHelpers

3. Other data:
- destructibles description
- animations
- textures and materials

Now let me describe these assets a little.

1. Models are kind of usual, and they are same as horizon 1. There are many static small destructible parts, one big skeletal model, and maybe a few more skeletal/static parts. All destructible parts are usually in one group, rarely in two. Canisters are in separate small groups, one for each canister type.

2. Skeletons. Why do we need all these?

Mesh skeleton has all bones for visual model parts, weighted, and many of them are not present in any other skeleton.

SkeletonHelpers (called robotmodelhelpers in zero dawn) is the only place that has all helper bones - for destructible parts.

Physics skeleton. In addition to base skeleton, it also has bones needed to attach helpers, and again, some of them are not anywhere else. Nothing is weighted to them, they are just auxiliary bones to attach helpers, and then destructible parts to be attached to those helpers.

Edge skeleton is almost same, but its needed for sony tool to work.

3. other data:

Animations - original EDGE anim files. Most animations are in one group, just its usually different group, not the same as main model.

Destructibles description is a special table that connects SkeletonHelpers with static destructible parts. That part of the process was done manually in Horizon 1, because everything had names. Now we need those too.

So the 1st step in getting any robot is finding all these assets, in which group they are. We already have a list of all main parts for a start (attached). Now here's what the tool does when it encounters these assets:

1. Models 

Models are exported as ASCII files. Note that destructible parts on the first run (when its unknown where to place them) are exported as static models. Later on, they will be exported as skeletal models, placed and weighted to corresponding bones.

2. Skeletons

All skeleton asset types (skeleton, physicsskeleton, skeletonhelpers, edgeskel) are exported as raw original assets with corresponding extension. Additionally, mesh skeletons are exported as ASCII + SMD, so they can be used to combine with ASCII model or SMD animation.

3. Other data

Destructibles description is not exported at all. This information is only used on the run, to update the data about how to connect destructible parts to helpers. The tool console output can also be used to create a list of all destructible parts and add them to the process. So far I'm only processing their "initial", undamaged states. Damaged states can also be added later.

Edge animations are exported to "anim_edge" subfolder with edge skeleton code in the end of its name. The group/asset number from this code will tell if its this robot animation, or another actor/character animation.

Textures and materials are exported to correspoding folders, just like it was before.

How to use the tool to get full robot.

1. Find mesh skeleton, physics skeleton and skeleton helpers.

If you don't care where each part is, just use the tool on all known groups for that robot. Run it as usual: h2_extr.exe <number>

After that, you will have a lot of stuff exported, and there will be several assets of each type. You need to choose only one of each type, the right one.

- mesh skeleton is the .Skeleton file thats indicated when extracting main body (the same one that is used in usual models like before)

- there are usually 2 .PhysicsSkeleton files, you need the big one

- there are many helper files, open them and see inside which one has helper bones for destructible parts. Correct one will have bones called like "body_helper", "LegPlate_helper", "part12_helper" etc. Some others may be very small, or have "camera", "action" helpers inside, they are not needed.

2. Once you have those 3 files, run the tool with 3 parameters:

h2_extr.exe <skeleton> <physicsskeleton> <skeletonhelpers> 

After that, you get FULL skeleton in ascii/smd called "..._robotskel" and a "robot_helpers" file. That robot_helpers file will gather information about all helper bones. ASCII skeleton will be needed to load the full model, and SMD version is for animations.

3. Process all destructible descriptions.

Again, if you don't know where they are, or don't care about it, just use the tool on all known groups and save the tool output. If in this output you see any missing groups for destructible parts, add them to your list. Messages looking like "Destructible mesh 235 - 8" mean that group 235 contains some needed parts.

4. Cleanup (optional)

Now everything is ready for final pass.

At this point, it may be good idea to delete all ASCII files. It's not required, but that way you can get rid of leftover static parts that will now be replaced with proper skeletal parts.

5. Final pass.

Run the tool on all groups contaning models. Or simply run it again on all of them. 

In the end, you get 3 kinds of ASCII files:
- files with _destr suffix are destructibles
- files with _static suffix are static parts
- all other "usual" files with no suffix - these are skeletal parts

After everything is exported to ASCII, you can process all parts exactly how it was in Horizon 1. Static parts may be loaded directly. Destructibles must be all merged together, then count submeshes, add that number above and merge with skeleton. Skeletal parts must be merged with skeleton. Or you can also merge them together like destructibles, but in this case, before merging, remove submesh count from each file.

Extracting Edge animations.

1. Export .edgeanim and .edgeskel files from animation group (if its not done yet)

Each robot has several edge skeletons, you need to use correct one, that corresponds to animations. You can see skeleton code in the end of every animation name.

2. Use Edge anim decompiler tool (found in leaked Vita SDK for example)

That tool is available in public, and has simple help option how to use it. Can be run in a batch. It outputs animation data as text. You need to save console (command window) output to text file for convertion.

3. Convert .txt to .smd with Edgetosmd.exe

Tool has only 1 parameter: input text file. As output, it creates .smd file with same name. Also can be run in a batch.

4. Merge full SMD skeleton with animations.

Resulting SMD files will only have animation frames, not the initial pose. The bind pose in these animations is usually all zeroes, and it can't be used to apply to the model, so I'm not exporting the bind pose. Instead, the full set of bones with their proper bind pose must be taken from full robot skeleton created before on the stage of model extraction.

You can merge each animation with skeleton individually, or merge several animation files putting skeleton in the beginning, so you can load them all as one big animation.

After that, you can apply animation to the model in your favourite 3d editor.

Hey all, I was very generously given the files for this game and have been feverishly extracting models ever since.  I have a suggestion for daemon1, though, would it be possible to identify which model uses which skeleton during extraction?  Instead of "Mesh with skeleton xxxx xx" messages, maybe something like "Mesh mmmm mm with skeleton xxxx xx"; or something like the materials.txt file, but for skeletons?  Some of the models use multiple skeletons, and it can get confusing which skeleton goes to which model file.

So, I've been working to extract HFW meshes and build a reference list of everything I can extract, and I came across something odd:  at code C9F1 there's a complete nude base male model.  What makes this odd is that there doesn't appear to be any female or child base models; at least not in the list of codes provided by daemon1.  There are complete body models stored in different npc character files, but in each case there are some kind of clothes included with the model.

Has anyone come across the missing base models, if they exist?

I know current workflow for robots is complicated. I may improve it later, maybe even making it all automatic, but for now at least for those who really want it, its possible to get them with all parts, and even animated.

p.s. added a version of Edgetosmd tool (Edgetosmd_i.exe) that adds all frames, with interpolated data. This is for noesis smd plugin which can't work properly without having all frames. Blender smd plugin can load only keyframes (this is what first tool did) making smaller smd files.

looking forward to it!
I'm an animator and would love to learn how the skeletal weights of this mechanical creature are assigned.
In the last year, I spent a month of my spare time and took 3 notes, but still couldn't figure out how to align the broken parts of Zero Dawn's robot rhino, let alone view the bones and animations.

As i don't have this game, can some one tell me this is big different between ps4 and ps5, such a textures size, polycount, like Aloy's hair on face in ps5 version?

Always great tool id-daemon, even i can't test it without resources.

PS5s currently can not be exploited publicly like the PS4, until hackers decide to release publicly a working PS5 exploit, there's no way to know beyond speculations.

As far as I know, the passcode for Forbidden West hasn't been shared yet.  Using all zeroes won't work on the official pkg, only on a fake pkg, which hasn't been released either.

Hi. Has anyone been able to find or pull a model of a FAS-BOR7 Horus (Metal Devil) from the Forbidden West files? I've been following the thread and see that most of the robots have been pulled and I was just wondering about the Horus model. Or if it is even possible to pull it. Thanks for your time.

Were I a betting woman, I'd guess they're in whatever dataset contains the environmental assets - if they're accessible at all.
I haven't seen anyone post that type of stuff. Its all characters, weapons and machines and stuff so far.

I have to clarify that all tool versions published here ONLY work with game release version 1.00
I don't support any updates (patches) yet.

Tool updated.
Now all 100% of 75493 asset packages work.
Also changed texture names from decimal to hex, so they correspond to material lists.

Hi, has anyone found Focus model, what is her code?

Its 2DFD_0.

Not much different to the HZD PC version - I think maybe a few extra polygons somewhere. 
One trick I've figured out is just scrubbing through the textures looking for the stuff I want - then finding the mesh via the file names.
Sometimes there seems to be a little discrepancy between them of a few numbers or letters up or down - but if you just scrub around that general starting location, you should find the thing.

That all said - has anyone seen the Zenith shuttle?
I've found maybe three components from it, and a bunch of the Zenith base stuff, but no shuttle itself or structures from their little island yet.

Yes, such meshes are not supported. You think there's something important there?

there's at least one robot file at A1F2 that throws this error, but it mostly seems to happen with environment meshes.  There's also a character at AA15 that throws an EndOfStreamException: Unable to read beyond the end of the stream error

External meshes usually mean they are very similar to some other mesh. I dont think its important. 
I did no support for them back then because not all asset packs were readable in the first place. This can be done now of course, but it will require lots of work, and i dont see much reason for it yet.

all assets get extracted just as described so that is good but when I try to import the .ascii files into blender they do not work. am I doing it wrong? is it the same process as the Zero Dawn tool where I have to paste the data of the skeleton meshes into the regular model files?

EDIT: nevermind i figured it out. it is tedious to copy and paste the data though. is there a way to automate it? like a script that converts the files to .txt files copies and pastes the skeleton text to the mesh texts and then saves them as ascii again.

I have done some research in files and have found almost all Machine Strike pieces. Only model missing for me is Rockbreaker, so i will be happy if someone will try to find it too or point me to it. I am fearing, that it is one of assets that failed to extract for me.

All pieces should be completed from appropriate base (any base + front arrow + rear bumper) and piece model. Those extracted models are symplified because they are using normal maps. Without maps attached they are looking little bit different than in game engine, but still recognisable.
I have just imported all needed parts into Blender through XNALara plugin and pieces were aligned well.

How do I convert the Ascii to SMD? Is there a plugin for Blender or Noesis?

Is there a way to extract the .core/.stream files? I'm trying to get at the music files, but as expected, none of the tools that worked for zero dawn work on forbidden west.

You only need one script installed not all of them, so if you have installed in Blender the XNALaraMesh you do not need the other lib assets, only use those if the other script does not work for you or has undesirable results.

half  success import HFW.static mesh is fine,skeleton mesh fail.
i use blender 2.8 + XNA Lara Mesh 2.02 import ascii file,file include static is fine，i think it use socket add on skeleton mesh.

have no include static file import has fail, i think XNA Lara addon can not support HFW skeleton mesh.
but daemon1 show successful video, so i think i  haven't used the right method yet.

blender  info log give me some text output

First step is learning how to post properly, stop spamming, learn to edit your last post if you need to add something, don't write a new post each time if your the last one that wrote in the thread, and no need for you to quote the whole post either, keep things organized.

Extracting Edge animations.

1. Export .edgeanim and .edgeskel files from animation group (if its not done yet)

Each robot has several edge skeletons, you need to use correct one, that corresponds to animations. You can see skeleton code in the end of every animation name.

2. Use Edge anim decompiler tool (found in leaked Vita SDK for example)

Hello, can you tell me how to export .edgeanim to smd, or where to get the Sony Edge tool?

How to use the tool to get full robot.

1. Find mesh skeleton, physics skeleton and skeleton helpers.

If you don't care where each part is, just use the tool on all known groups for that robot. Run it as usual: h2_extr.exe <number>

After that, you will have a lot of stuff exported, and there will be several assets of each type. You need to choose only one of each type, the right one.

- mesh skeleton is the .Skeleton file thats indicated when extracting main body (the same one that is used in usual models like before)

- there are usually 2 .PhysicsSkeleton files, you need the big one

- there are many helper files, open them and see inside which one has helper bones for destructible parts. Correct one will have bones called like "body_helper", "LegPlate_helper", "part12_helper" etc. Some others may be very small, or have "camera", "action" helpers inside, they are not needed.

2. Once you have those 3 files, run the tool with 3 parameters:

h2_extr.exe <skeleton> <physicsskeleton> <skeletonhelpers> 

After that, you get FULL skeleton in ascii/smd called "..._robotskel" and a "robot_helpers" file. That robot_helpers file will gather information about all helper bones. ASCII skeleton will be needed to load the full model, and SMD version is for animations.

3. Process all destructible descriptions.

Again, if you don't know where they are, or don't care about it, just use the tool on all known groups and save the tool output. If in this output you see any missing groups for destructible parts, add them to your list. Messages looking like "Destructible mesh 235 - 8" mean that group 235 contains some needed parts.

4. Cleanup (optional)

Now everything is ready for final pass.

At this point, it may be good idea to delete all ASCII files. It's not required, but that way you can get rid of leftover static parts that will now be replaced with proper skeletal parts.

5. Final pass.

Run the tool on all groups contaning models. Or simply run it again on all of them. 

In the end, you get 3 kinds of ASCII files:
- files with _destr suffix are destructibles
- files with _static suffix are static parts
- all other "usual" files with no suffix - these are skeletal parts

After everything is exported to ASCII, you can process all parts exactly how it was in Horizon 1. Static parts may be loaded directly. Destructibles must be all merged together, then count submeshes, add that number above and merge with skeleton. Skeletal parts must be merged with skeleton. Or you can also merge them together like destructibles, but in this case, before merging, remove submesh count from each file.
Hi, I had some problems working with the parts of the robot, I now merged the bones and pasted them on top of the bones (I pasted them manually one by one), imported them into blender successfully, most of the model got the bones and the correct weights, but there was a problem working with the static destructible mesh. There is no way to get the correct position and weight of the model by pasting it into the skeleton. These destructible parts of the import software are all at the origin



Since then, I've read the instructions over and over again. Is there a command to merge geometry with one click? There is an executive tool command in steps 3 and 5 that synthesizes all skeletons at once. Okay? What is this command? Drag.ascll to h2_extr.exe? I'm stuck on giving the exact skeleton position to the destructible grid, and where to get the decompiler for the animation next?



Please let me know if you notice

yes, there is a command to merge geometry. They are simple text files. You can use any advanced text editor that can merge multiple files in one click. Or you can use standard windows copy command (from command line).

The process above is designed to place destructible parts correctly, thats why steps 3 and 5 are needed.

the decompiler can be found by googling "vita sdk".

Thank you for your reply,

Now I have passed the command: copy *.ascii merage.ascii merged all my staticmesh and _robotskel.ascii into a single.ascii file. I then opened noesis to load the merged file. Only the skeleton is loaded correctly, but the file size tells me that it did merge all of the StaticMeshes



I think I overlooked something again, so I re-read the tutorial and your reply carefully, I think I did a good job incorporating this step, I noticed a tip at the end of the 5 steps: then count submeshes, add that number above and merge with skeleton? 


I'm sorry I don't have any model building or programming knowledge, I don't know what submeshes is in the text, I had to solve this "submeshes" by using the notepad to open all static.ascii and found, There are actually a few lines at the beginning of the text that should specify grid information. Here's an example:



0

1

mesh_0_sm_0_material_824C_169B

1

1

texture

0

892



Do you want to delete the submeshes from this text before merging the staticmesh? And paste the skeleton into the first line of text, okay?



After sorting things out, I think I just need to know that I have



_robotskel.ascii

_robotskel.smd

robot_helpers

There are 52 _static.ascii in total



After all this, how do I merge all 52 _static.ascii and give them the right skeleton and import blender with all 52 in the right place



Maybe these are too complicated for me. Can you add an automated program? Just drag in all of the.ASCII grid bodies (either static or skeletal) and the correct merged skeleton to merge them and get a skeleton weight and all of the skeleton mesh parts and destructible mesh parts in the correct position



Looking forward to your reply

Yes, this tool was mostly expected to be used by people who already extracted robots from Horizon Zero Dawn. And even then its complicated.
I had plans for more automation, but sometime later.

That's OK, about the automation tool I can wait for it to be released, now I can make these manually, it only takes a little time, can you tell me how to insert the skeleton correctly into all _static.ascii, or how do I calculate the correct location of _static.ascii, I have three merged files

you can't insert skeleton into _static.ascii because they are static
as its stated in the instruction, you can only insert skeleton to _destr files

So how do I merge _static.ascii to get the correct _destr.ascii? The skeleton is then inserted

you dont merge _static.ascii to get the correct _destr.ascii
those are generated by the tool on the step 5

How to Process all destructible descriptions? I don't have a clue. Can you explain this operation in detail?

Process them as all other groups with the same tool.
For example, if you process the main robot group, and in the output it tells you that destructibles are located in group 235, then you need to process group 235.

Hi there! I'm trying to figure out how to get the ASCII models into Blender, but I keep getting an error when importing using the XNALara plugin.
Here's an image of it: [https://imgur.com/UfDUo0Y](https://imgur.com/UfDUo0Y)

Also curious about the textures, specifically the albedo ones. Are they super multi-colored because of the dying system? If so, how would I go about using the 'default' colors for a given outfit?

Oh also the original download links seem to be broken. They're archived in the Wayback Machine, but updating them on here might be nice lol

I can't put them here because xentax only allows 256k files. And zenhax seems to be gone forever.

error must be because of incorrect usage or process. Hard to tell without knowing anything you did there.

I would just upload to Google Drive or something like that. Github would work well also.

I'm not sure what I could be doing wrong on the import. I've got your tool exporting the models into ASCII just fine seemingly. Do you use Blender?

Its already described in the thread, and it takes several pages. Theres no need to repeat it. If you have questions on some specific part of it, i can explain.

Ok so I've been talking to JP in the HZD modding Discord and they seem to think there might be something wrong with the extractor or the .ascii files it puts out. I'm not really sure since idk much about .ascii 3D stuff. Basically they were able to successfully extract and setup some models like the Clawstrider and so was I, but it seems like some just don't work and give that `Index Out of Range` error.

Might be worth looking into on your end as well.

I see no errors on my end. Tool was released more than a year ago, and had no problems ever since.
You must be doing something wrong. Unless you tell me what are you doing there, i can't help you.

Would you be able to send me that model? I just need the mesh. Could maybe compare the .ascii files also to see what the difference is if any.

Well that's certainly frustrating from my end lol
Would you be able to send me that model? I just need the mesh. Could maybe compare the .ascii files also to see what the difference is if any.
I'm sure they are exactly same on your end. Probably you combined them wrong or corrupted them somehow before loading.

There's really no way for me to know what went wrong without comparing to your working version. Could you send it to me?

I dont usually send anything. Its not allowed here, and it would require a lot of time to find a way to do that.

Can you just tell what you did with outfit files before you tried to load them in blender?

I've tried importing them by themselves and importing them as merged, nothing works. I use the XNALara plugin as I think someone here mentioned.
Here's a screenshot of the extraction: [https://imgur.com/11xoPt8](https://imgur.com/11xoPt8)

Also Github, like I've mentioned, is a great place to host things like this. Most of the modding community uses that or Nexus. You can also just add me on Discord (auramalexander) and send it there if you want, but it seems you don't want to lol

oh, so you are not merging the model with its skeleton before loading? Then no wonder it doesnt work. Since you said Clawstrider worked fine, i was sure you did that.

I have merged the .ascii files that it outputs. Is there something else I need to merge? Your documentation is a little all over the place so forgive me if I missed something.

I did not expect much people to even try it. Considering there are no names and its hard to find anything. Mostly people who worked with 1st game a lot. And they all know how to merge ascii. 
Which files you merged and in which order? 
You cant just merge anything. You can only merge one skeleton with one mesh part and skeleton goes first. Of course its also possible to merge them all together, but that requires additional steps.

JP on the Discord server sent me a .bat file that runs this "copy /b *.ascii MERGED.ascii"
So it just merges all the .ascii files into one. Now that I look closer though it does seem there are skeletons here.

that explains it. This batch merges files in "random" order. So that robot worked, and the outfit didnt.

Oh I see, what is the proper way to merge them then? I just read through and the only instructions on merging I could find are about the robots with merging animations and other skeletons and such.

Oh! I just tried manually merging in a text editor and that worked! I copied everything from the C5BB_skel_1.ascii file then the C5BB_0.ascii file and that did the trick. So yes I'm assuming the issue was the skeleton parts not being at the top.

Any advice on how to merge the non-robot meshes properly?

EDIT: Did the rest of the meshes manually and it looks like I'm missing the chest piece. Everything else has imported into Blender just fine and I re-extracted and ended up with the same amount of files. What was the chest piece called on your version?

I did not mess up something. I've extracted it many times and have shown you the screenshot of what happens when I extract it. Please I'd really appreciate it if you could explain more than just "you messed up" or "works fine for me." Every time I extract it gives me 9 meshes, none of which are the chest piece.

This is because i dont see another explanation. The situation you describe seems impossible.

Yes it has 9 pieces, and one of them is chest piece.
Lets try this. Extract them all again, load one at a time, and you will see where you messed up.

Hi hi so I decided to just show my whole process for the extraction in a video here: [https://youtu.be/V37tPXqnSBE](https://youtu.be/V37tPXqnSBE)
If the quality is low, just give YouTube some time to process it up to 4K.

Hopefully this clears up any confusion that just posting here has created. Really hoping I'm just doing something simple wrong here. Worst case, I'd still definitely appreciate you sending the .ascii over for me. Since it's just a text file, you could drop it in a Pastebin: [https://pastebin.com/](https://pastebin.com/)

Either way, let me know! Thanks for your help.

ok at least 2 parts are merged wrong: c5bb_2.ascii & c5bb_3.ascii
You can see yourself that something is wrong with them.

Alright I see what happened. I must've saved over one of them. The chest piece was 3 though, wasn't 4 so I'm not totally crazy.
I really recommend updating your documentation and moving this project to Github. I'm sure people would appreciate it.

Need to figure out the textures next. Any advice you have there would be much appreciated.

- Post Title: Re: Horizon Forbidden West [PS4/PS5]

Tool for PS5 version released.
I didnt check how much its different, but at least some robots and outfits are better quality.
Link on 1st post. Asset lists included here.
Usage is the same, expect theres no need for oodle dll.



Here's how the lists work:
body variants - describe each and every variation of human characters. More than 1000. You can export and combine them to get actual combinations
controlled entities - all robots are actially those. Also animals and a few other things. I did not check them all, so some of them are still under question, but all robots are there
faces - or heads - self-explanatory
outfits - aloy outfits. Hopefully these are all, got them automatically. some may be missing
all_assets_ps5 is the main game asset tree partially decoded. It contains useful info about most interesting parts. For example, detailed description of all robots, body variants, and other skeletal meshes

For example, if you need a face or outfit, you just use the number from the list. But if you need to get a full robot, you need to search for its code in all_assets_ps5 file to find its model parts, skeletons, helpers, destructibles etc. Note that there's no such thing as complete robot description in the game. Robot is a combination of its "entity", model, and other parts. Some robots use same entity, but a little different model (such as horse and goat). Some use same model, but spawns with different destructible parts. It all can be found in the tree. Same if you need a body combined, search for its code and get codes for all its parts

p.s. i have made same lists for PS4 too

An example spawn setup for a robot:

```
SpawnSetup:
  Entity ---> 55C 7D 
  Entitycomponent ---> 4E7 D SkinnedModelResource
  Entitycomponent ---> 55C 43 RagdollComponentResource
  Entitycomponent ---> B80 3 DestructibilityResource
AI context = CONTEXT_ARMADILLO_WALK

```

In this example, setup tells the game to spawn an entity 55C (which is armadillo), with a ragdoll also from package 55C, destructible parts described in B80, and a model from 4E7.
Ragdoll - will have physics skeleton.
Destructibility resource - will have destructible parts description, or links to where they are.
Model will have main skeleton, helpers, and all meshes:

```
SkinnedModelResource:
  Modelpart 4E7 2F 
  Modelpart 4E7 9F 
  Modelpart 4E7 56 
     ....
  Modelpart 4E7 6F 
  Modelpart 4E7 1F4 
  Modelpart 4E7 118 
  SkeletonHelpers 4E7 11F 
  SkeletonHelpers 4E7 7F 
  SkeletonHelpers 4E7 2BF 
  Skeleton ---> 4E7 0 

```

Here we can see that skeleton, helpers, and all parts are in the same package - 4E7, but its not always like that.

Oh, great! Didn't see you had moved it to Github, that's wonderful.

And for the textures I meant if you had a shader setup in Blender to convert the textures to normal colors.

Ill post this here too for everyone trying to get the textures working properly it requires a good deal of nodes. Hopefully revetix will be able to build some kind of tool allowing you to plug in material info and it give a correct map. 

If not this will require "baking" of all these textures somehow in blender or your 3D application. He did a test on the file above using 

Hopefully something can come from the info and we will be able to get textures working correctly. Still very mind blowing to see this kind of technique used and the quality achieved from it.

Tha.... nevermind lol

Wondering if you'd be willing to share more info on the shader setup here? Possibly a version for Blender?

That account has been banned for good, you wont be able to get an answer from it, go back and edit your post, you made a mess quoting the whole thing.
Imagine if i too would have quoted the whole thing from your post, keep it organized.

That sucks that they've been banned. They were the only one posting in here about having figured out the textures and I can't make out what the node setup is from the images they posted.

I mean, how do you usually search for it?

NexusMods is generally the hub for modding these days. That then usually points to a Discord community. For example, in the SoulsModding community we all post our work on Nexus and congregate in Discord servers, the main one being ?ServerName? where people post even more mods, helpful tips, and tools developed by the community. There is a HZD modding community on Discord, but like I've mentioned it's pretty small and inactive. Here's a link to that if you're interested: [https://discord.gg/ayQ4APPMsD](https://discord.gg/ayQ4APPMsD)

Ah, ok, thanks. This is for lucky few games that have modding community. I was thinking about possible options for all other games, including old and obscure ones. After zenhax gone, and xentax under question, there's not much left.

You can't currently open PS5 pkgs. The only way is to download already decrypted dump from any of the sites that offer them.
