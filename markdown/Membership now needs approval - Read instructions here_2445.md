- Post Title: Membership now needs approval - Read instructions here

Due to low-lives that think spamming is fun, we are confronted with new "members" that wish only to drop their filthy messages here. 

Therefore, registration is still open for anyone, but Admin approval is needed to be able to post anything. 

People who wish only to read stuff are still welcome to register, yet won't be able to post anything unless they specifically request so. 

To become an active member you should:

1. Register normally at this forum

2. Contact us at the MultiEx Commander registration address.  

a. "MultiEx Forum Application" in the subject header
b. Give a valid reason why you wish to become an active member. This needn't be high-profile or lenghty, just show you are human and not some spammer. 


Good luck!
