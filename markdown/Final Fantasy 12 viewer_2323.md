Just a viewer?
Not even an extractor or anything....
Also you do know this game hasnt been released in the Europe right...
So that leaves a good load of us without anything to look at.

But there IS a viewer avaliable i believe its by a dude called yaz0r.
Search it up in googlr ul find it son enough, though maybe his was jsut for X,X2 and XI.

But if you can provide soem files we can attempt at soem extraction and stuffs like that... but a viwer huh.. Sounds more like Xela's area of expertise to me, though this game is a DVD9 if i remember rightly so youl neeed to make an ISO of it before you take the ISO apart and send us some files.

Well a viewer is just nice. I'll take an extractor and an OBJ converter any day over a viewer. Guess in retrospect the latter would be easier. I'll burn an ISO and see what I can give you guys. What do you need exactly?

-5Well if u can make an ISO of it then take some files from INSIDE the ISO(ie:example files such as erm.. Character.DAT) then upload that to us if you can.
Though chances are they will be big files youl most likely need ot use the file cutter to upload things to us ok.

Hmm. No Character.DAT. Got a couple of .IRX and one .63 file that is HUGH. Also a .IMG file that I think might have what you need in it. Any advice?

Tell me the sizes of EVERY SINGLE file inside there.

the IRX files in PS2 games TEND to be used as controllers for things such as showing images on screen, controller settings,Memory card ect..
But how big is this .63 file dude?

How big is the .IMG because in SQUARE games the files are normally hidden u know, so if everything is there then its kinda strange i think rofl.
Then again they might ahve changed th emethod for FFXII u know.

Its NONE of them files dude, this game is DVD9 after all, so u need to make an ISO and then upload an ISO cut piece here on the forum and we will see if we can extract the models from that.
THEN learn about the files themselves, this is gonna take some time me thinks, and im pretty sure itl be  a real challenge for us all, and a good few ppl here are better at this then me u know.

yeah but the DVD is about 7 gig and all those files u put thee dont amount to nothing at all only like 6 meg at most.
The one you said was HUGE is only 4MEG according to your previous post.

So that leaves 99.9% of the disks memory unaccounted for.

Not sure, your best bet is to find a program that rips BOTH LAYERS of a DVD, a dual layer ripper i mean.
I currenlty only JUST TIHS SECOND woke up so i can barely even see so i cant think enough to link you to one sorry.

hi,
i extracted all files with dvddecrypter and used a file splitter.
i have loads of files now,but what to do with them???
i too am looking for a way to extraxt the textures,view meshes,etc and found a program (by Yazor called FFXIIDumper)but it doesn't seem to work as i get windows error.
i don't know why i get the error.
i tried this Yaz0r's stuff with his how to use tutorial but can't seem to do it.
maybe i'm a noob or just plain stupid??
here's the link of his blog/website : [http://www.yaz0r.net/](http://www.yaz0r.net/)
and his forum: [http://www.yaz0r.net/forum/index.php?board=5.0](http://www.yaz0r.net/forum/index.php?board=5.0)
i really need to extract the textures and meshes   
i can email the files if i need too.
