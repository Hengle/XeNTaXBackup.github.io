Can anyone tell me how I can extract or view the 3d models of CoC? I saw some .wad files

I need the models to by in my game.

You can download a majority of M:CoC models at [http://gamesrepository.000webhostapp.com](http://gamesrepository.000webhostapp.com) check either "android" or "ios". Alternatively, extract the wads with 7zip or winrar and open the files with unitystudio
