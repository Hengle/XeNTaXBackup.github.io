- Post Title: Sneak preview: XeNTaX WIKI!

Dear members of the XeNTaX forums!

We are proud to give you a sneak preview of our latest project, 

The XeNTaX Game Resource Archive Formats WIKI, or XeNTaX WIKI for short. 

A couple of years ago I started a website, OpenGRAF, in which I wanted to get, as much as possible, specifications of game resource archive formats (GRAFs) freely available to the public, and invited anyone else to participate. This project failed however, due to lack of time on my part (it was a turbulent time). 

However, we thought now was the time to start this again. 

The last couple of weeks Captain Corny (our webmaster), Watto (of Game Extractor), Elbereth (of Dragon Unpacker) and yours truly (of MultiEx Commander) have worked hard to build the XeNTaX WIKI, already giving specifications for more than 600 different GRAFs. 

As we appreciate your help in "demystification" of GRAFs so far, we feel it is prudent to let you in on it before the official release on Sunday May 29th. 

Please have a look around, and while you're at it, join the project (it's easy, just sign up with name and password). 

If you have any additions that you would like to see at the WIKI, feel free to add them yourself to the WIKI. Stuff like Formats Specifications, Game Specific Tools and the like are welcome, anything that would help the game modder! There's help available on how to proceed. 

Remember, it's a WIKI, so it's succes depends largely on an active community, just like all WIKIs. 

We hope you like what we built for you, and that you can support the XeNTaX WIKI project any way you can. 

Sneak over to [http://wiki.xentax.com](http://wiki.xentax.com) and see what we are talking about for yourself! But, please keep it a secret until we do a press release on May the 29th! 

On behalf of the XeNTaX WIKI team, 

Best regards, 

Mr.Mouse/XeNTaX
