Hi all! I really need your help. I am very sorry if I posted in the wrong section, but I really want to learn how to do this.

I am wondering, how I can extract these 3d model files from this chinese game Onmyoji Arena 5v5 Moba game. I have tried all the things that I can do as far as my knowledge goes.

Sample Model I want to extract: Yoto hime and all her other skins.


I already tried the Ninja ripper + Nox method, but this is the result...

Please help me with these. I really need it for cosplay purposes. Thank you so much in advance for anyone who can help me.
