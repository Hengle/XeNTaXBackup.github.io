Subaru Vivio
Subaru Alcyone SVX
Nissan March (MkI or MkII)
Skyline (R31)
Lancer Evo.IV
Cefiro (A31)
Prelude (BB4)
Daihatsu Mira TR-XX

Especially SVX!!! I like it!
I'd appreciate it if you convert it.....

I have a model of Alcyone SVX if you wanted to. It's from DRIFT SPIRITS (iOS/Android) which apparently take the car models off from Wangan Midnight Maximum Tune 4 (Arcade game).
PM me if you want the file
