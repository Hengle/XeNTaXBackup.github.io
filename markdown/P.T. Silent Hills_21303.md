- Post Title: P.T. Silent Hills

Hi, does anyone still have files for PT Silent Hills? Any format would be cool cause I am able to extract models, but I can't seem to find the file with textures (I am talking about exterior scene, that street). Any help would be appreciate. I can even PayPal person who will be willing to help me find it or just send a link for it. Just DM me here. Thanks in advance!
