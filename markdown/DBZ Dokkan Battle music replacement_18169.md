Dokkan Battle is an android game that uses CRI ACB/AWB archives to store their music. For awhile now I have been trying to figure out ways to inject my own music but whenever I load up the game with that custom music, the sound is always distorted. Is this something to do with the game or am I just not replacing the files correctly? I've tried using SonicAudioTools, AtomEncd and CriAtomEncd but they all give me the same result

It's because the files are encrypted, Degod can decrypt then, the problem after that is how to encrypt a custom music file so the game can play it normally
