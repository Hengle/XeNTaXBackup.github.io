Hello everyone,
I extracted, edited and reimported .big files previously successfully inside FIFA 14 Obb file Android. Now I am trying to edit a .png files, Hud_fui.png. I edited this image and deleted offside indicator icon, and then reimported. But now all icons etc of this image is gone inside the game. While I see in other tutorials where they are doing same process and succeeding.
Please help me, how to import .png file successfully.
Thanks
