- Post Title: ryse of rome level

Hello,
In extracting the  files .pak, is it possible to open entirely, in the cryengine3 sdk, some level of the game "Ryse, Son of rome"? 
If so, how to achieve this process in the cryengine editor? It is just for observing the level and learning the editor.
thank you all for your replies
