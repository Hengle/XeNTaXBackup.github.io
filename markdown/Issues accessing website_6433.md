Since yesterday I can't enter the website properly, wheter from Google or my favourite. it always directs me to "Default parallels Plesk Panel Page", even if I type [http://forum.xentax.com/](http://forum.xentax.com/)
In order to access it, I have to enter from "cached" and then navigate from there, and it does not always work. any ideas why?

Interesting. Our host had an update couple of days ago. Works fine over here, perhaps give it some time. Clean the cache of your browser etc.

Hi!

Well i also have the similar experience like yours!  i think accessing a cache is very similar to the main page of the site but cache says that the main page may change in the meantime but i didn't see any difference! and in-accessing always happens to me when my server lost connection or connection time out!   i know my bad  

Thanks
