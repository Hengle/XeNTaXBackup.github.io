I have guessed some parts of the file so I have written a simple extractor which I have attached.
in all the 3 files you attached the audio is pcm at 11025hz, 1 chan, 8 bits so I don't know if in the other files it can change.

then the files seem to contain something like various blocks of alternated audio and probably video, anyway let me know if this works well on all the files you have.

*edit* I have fixed one thing in the tool so redownload it if you already downloaded it before (now it's version 0.1a)

Firstly, allow me to apologise for my utter tardiness in posting my follow-up observations here. I have had some health problems of late, which drew me back into not only a preoccupied state, but an unmotivated one as well.

But secondly, thank you very sincerely for your response, Luigi  I appreciate the time/effort you put aside into looking at this particular .vol format for me.

So to begin, here are some of the observations I made on your voyvolmus command-line tool in regards to particular .vol files on the first disk of the game.



BUMPER.VOL ---> filesize: 1.33MB

voyvolmus outputs a single .wav file to the size of 148kb. This wave plays fine, and judgment has it that this is undoubtedly this audio track to a company logo at the beginning of the game.
NOTE: If I open the bumper.vol file in audition as raw audio, 8-bit unsigned pcm, 11050khz mono, (citing Appolo's post here: [viewtopic.php?f=21&t=3356](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=21&t=3356)) I get the same audio product as voyvolmus gets, only: with breaks of screeching [data] in between the continuity of the logo-audio. See here: [http://img9.imageshack.us/img9/6921/audbumpervol.jpg](http://img9.imageshack.us/img9/6921/audbumpervol.jpg)

The above which quite clearly implies that voyvolmus has the capacity to filter/separate the audio streams from the video/data streams contained in the .vol archives. But I'm sure that you already gathered as much (and then some) as has just been stated by me.


----------------------


SLIDESX.VOL ---> filesize: 4.91MB

voyvolmus outputs 12 .wav files. The accumulative sum of the individual files is 2.39MB.
These .wavs all sounds fine. They all prove to be just as the .vol title suggests; slides (sounds like someone looking through short video slides on some random, oldschool video projector?)


---------------------------


Now for the critical analysis:

CABIN.VOL --> 12.1MB
DISK1.VOL --> 461MB      [NOTE: THE ABOVE-MENTIONED .VOL ARCHIVES AND THE ONES ON THE LEFT ARE NOT THE ONLY ONES ON THE DISK, ONLY THE LARGEST]
ENDINGS.VOL --> 83.2MB

In hindsight, voyvolmus extracted quite easily the .wav audio from the .vol files I provided in my initial post (the smaller ones), yet these above there (amongst others) were not so easy.

SPEC. OBSERVATIONS:
-------------------
CABIN.VOL - No output .wav file larger than 44kb. No wav file longer than 4seconds (also note that the 4 seconds of audio cuts-into and cuts-out impromptu at the beginning and end of each .wav
--Also each .wav file carries a similar filesize to others (i.e. multiple files 44kb, 19kb, 11kb 2kb -- maybe some connection? i dunno)




DISK1.VOL and ENDINGS.VOL carry pretty much the same observations as the former, yet there was one potential anomaly which I noticed with DISK1.VOL (possibly only due to its large filesize) which was that voyvolmus produced 557 1kb .wav files...
They [obviously] don't produce any sound. Aside from the 1kb files, the remaining 575 .wav files the batch-util produces are mostly 23, 22 and 21 KB in size.




This wraps up most of what I could conceive from my resulting analysis of .vol and voyvolmus. I hope this info is helpful to you, Bugtest, and that it ultimately results in a fully-working .vol extractor 

Thanks again so much for you initial help, and I look forward to your response

uhmm so resuming the only file which gives strange results is the biggest one (DISK1.VOL), right?

because the difference between waves size and file size is correct since the files are just a sequence of alternated audio and video blocks.

in this case the only suggestion I can give you is to try to open DISK1.VOL with the raw sound editor and check if you "hear" other audio blocks which have not been extracted by voyvolmus.

ah ok, so was just a problem of filenames.
well forget voyvolmus, I have written a quick BMS script for handling the archives and saving them as an unique file:

```
# script for QuickBMS http://aluigi.org/papers.htm#quickbms
#
# remember to use wavehead with the extracted file:
#   wavehead SLIDES.VOL.raw SLIDES.VOL.wav 11025 1 8 1

append
get NAME filename
string NAME += ".raw"

idstring "ID\x0c\x00"
get DUMMY short
get FILES long
get TOTAL_SIZE long
savepos INFO_OFFSET

for i = 0 < FILES
    goto INFO_OFFSET
    get DUMMY long
    get OFFSET long
    get SIZE long
    savepos INFO_OFFSET

    math OFFSET += 42
    goto OFFSET
    get FSIZE long
    getdstring DUMMY 16
    set REM long SIZE
    math REM -= 62

    for
        get TYPE long
        get LEN long
        math REM -= 8
        if LEN <= 0
            break
        endif
        if REM <= 0
            break
        endif
        math REM -= LEN

        savepos OFFSET
        if TYPE & 1
            log NAME OFFSET LEN
        endif
        math OFFSET += LEN
        goto OFFSET
    next
next i
```
as written there you need [QuickBMS](http://aluigi.org/papers.htm#quickbms) and [wavehead](http://aluigi.org/testz.htm#wavehead).
remember to use the -o option of quickbms otherwise you will be prompted to overwrite the output file continuously: quickbms -o voyvolmus.bms slider.vol c:\
let me know if everything is ok

EDIT|RE: prev. post||  OK --- you're still going 2 need the zip file I uploaded but forget about the wav example, since I decided that it was a poor example, given the clicking noises. See attachment for fixed audio.

why don't you upload the first 10 or 20 megabytes of DISK1.VOL or DISK2.vol?
because without the file for me is impossible to guess what is missing

mistery solved, the audio is any odd TYPE (TYPE & 1).
I have updated the previous script so now it works :)

I had a chance to check this out at the beginning of last week, so here I am now once again report the status of things.

I tried out your new and improved script and I must say; it did it's job very well indeed. I haven't really had a moment to listen to all of the exported audio, but from what I've heard, it's spot on!   

I'll certainly be going through it all later on, when I edit it them (to split the conjoined-wavs apart into individual tracks) so I'll post any potential anomalies or problems. Though I doubt there will be any  

If there's nothing to report, I assume we can deem this particular topic of investigation officially closed.  

On a side note; I'm glad I uploaded the clip of that particular vol file, as you solved it in a flash! Shows just how invaluable you are, Bugtest!  

Thanks again mate
