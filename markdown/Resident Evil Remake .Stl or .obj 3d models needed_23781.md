- Post Title: Resident Evil Remake .Stl or .obj 3d models needed

Hello guys,

I am new here, i found this site after a lot of search and after doing a very good search i decided to addres here 

I have some friends who made a Resident Evil Remake Board Game.

And we are in need for help to create some models just for personal use.

Some great guys exacted from the Remake game a model of Rebecca, Barry, Chris, Jill and Wesker. They also made a Hunter, Tyrant and Yawn model for print.

But there are some models we wasn't able to exact.

There were: of the Chimera, the Plant 42, Lisa Trevor and the Wasp.

After a long search i wasn't able to find the models anywhere on the internet. 

And since i am not a program expert i found out this Forum. There's anyone who can help us out in some way?

I remind we are not going to share anything if not authorized by you. It's just for personal use.

Thanks
