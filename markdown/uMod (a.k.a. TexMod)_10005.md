- Post Title: uMod (a.k.a. TexMod)

Most of you probably know about TexMod. It got quite famous a few years back. Now it's creator has updated it and wants to keep improving it, but he needs your help.

Here's the project page:
[http://code.google.com/p/texmod/](http://code.google.com/p/texmod/)

And here's some info for the ones who aren't familiar with the tool:

> TexMod was originally created by RS as a modding utility for “Tomb Raider 7: Legend” back in 2006. It allows to extract textures from DirectX 9 applications, and to pack eventually changed textures into TPF files (TexMod Package File) to load those back to the application replacing the original textures. This allowed players to change the appearance of Lara Croft and other characters of the game. TexMod and a lot customizations are still available at Tomb Raider HUB.

> Years later, players of Guild Wars discovered TexMod and its great functionality, and so they started to make their own customizations for Guild Wars. Being to only real way to change a player's interface, plus the fact that it was being allowed by the developer ArenaNet, it got very popular. Now when searching for TexMod on google, the first result is linking to an article about it on the official Guild Wars Wiki.

> However as great as the original TexMod is, its development stopped with the actual release of it, so this project is an approach to create an open source port of TexMod while integrating new features and hopefully a great future compilance (regarding DirectX 10 and 11).

Note: I know I'm totally advertising someone's work, but the guy needs help and you seem like the ones who can make this thing happen. Imagine a tool that allows you to edit the models and textures (or even motions/materials/effects in the future) of every game. You can make this happen.

Well I am, sort of at least, I'm still using the app, and always wanted to see a new version of it, but I have no experience in what he is looking for.
