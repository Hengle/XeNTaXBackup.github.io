Hi.  This is localized version of Nihon falcom games and I want to decrypt it. Could someone help me?

Have you tried using the widely known Nihon Falcom tools by this guy?

[http://translate.google.com/translate?h ... &sandbox=1](http://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&sl=ja&tl=en&u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.pokanchan.jp%2Fdokuwiki%2Fsoftware%2Ffalcnvrt%2Fstart&sandbox=1)

its all command line stuff, but provided the files are one of the following formats

ITP
IT3

Or one of the formats falcomconvert supports.

This is a lot easier than getting someone to download a 600mb file just to see what it is, providing a file chunk or a hex screenshot would have helped a bit more.

I already know how to deal with falcom format except *.itv file.
And this is not usual falcom format and can not easy to decrypt it.
You may have difficulty in understanding it even if you see hex screenshot because of its encryption.
