The arcade game already been dumped.
Here is the sample of pac file from the chr folder

format use .pac with "ARC header"
The filenames is on the beginning
I think the model use ".mod" file types.

The NODE probably referring to bones? (I don't really familiar)
I saw some faces hex. I don't know if this an archive or a 3d model format 

A help will be appreciated!
