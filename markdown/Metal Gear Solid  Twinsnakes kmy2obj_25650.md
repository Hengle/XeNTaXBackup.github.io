- Post Title: Metal Gear Solid : Twinsnakes kmy2obj

This tool is by gdkchan not me. I didnt see anything anything here about this tool but it converts twin snake models to obj. I simply compiled it from hit github here : [https://github.com/gdkchan/kmy2obj](https://github.com/gdkchan/kmy2obj).  Some triangles face the wrong way and makes look like it has holes you could try to fix the orientation or just turn off culling.
