So i managed to pull this off but i cant get the eyebrows right. I also have some textures that are in black and white and i dont know what they are for. I was wondering if u could help me get the eyebrows right an maybe do some adjustments in order to have this perfect.

Big question is what did you use to extract models, tools/scripts what kind of process, or is one of those secrets that will remain untold?

PS: Would be wise to edit the nudity part, some might get offended.

Took a look, in Blender, and here's what fixed the eyelashes:

First, set the texture file to 14.dds
Next, in the texture tab, scroll down to Influence and check Alpha.
On the Materials tab, scroll down to Transparency and check the box.  Make sure Z Transparency is selected, then set the Alpha value to zero.

I would love to know how to extract the models but i actually got them from a link on a youtube video. I can give u the link of the video if u want but i m afraid that the secret is still a secret.
Also, thanks for the tip of editing the nudity.

Thanks for your help, im really new to 3D modelling so i need all the help i can get. The next thing i will try to do is to add some bones. I honestly know nothing about adding bones to a model but i guess some youtube videos will do the trick
