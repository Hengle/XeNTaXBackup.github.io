- Post Title: Shrek Extra Large - ripping models from lmp files

I'm trying to rip models from Shrek Extra Large for the Gamecube and I think I know where they are. In the files folder, there's one known as "media" and has file names within such as "map.lmp" and "sewers.lmp" which I believe refers to two levels.

This link has map.lmp, which is used for the map level which acts as the hub world. if anyone could figure out how to get these out It would be greatly appreciated.

I used offzip with the .lmp and got a .rox file with some text:

No vertices so far, maybe it's a 2D map?
