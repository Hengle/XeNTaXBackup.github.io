@Everyone Who have other ways to open it?

Problem alright, those files are ENCRYPTED and not normal, looks like they have intentionally put measures in to stop you decoding them and worse yet, seemingly whole file is obscured, not just header.
Would need some pretty good programmer guys to figure out the method to decipher it and such people are limited supply, you may not be getting those. Maybe you get lucky.

Today, I see Filelist .xml in that file have encoding code... I can encoding it with EasyEncrypto
But, How to convert .ENCRYPTED(Picture Files) to Picture Files? (.bmp, .png, .jpg) or .PKM File with Non-Encryption

You have to figure out the precise encryption method used (I would doubt they put that info an filelist.xml) and there are so many of those as possibilities, once you know it, then you can seek for an decrypter tools on net or try find programmer write one based on OpenSSL etc, once the file is decrypted or decompressed (if not ciphered) to normal PKM, then you can decode it using mali tools for example. EasyEncrypto is not of help much if it only encrypts and not de-encrypt.

I'm not programmer (You need programmer with knowledge on encryptions on this) and can not assist further on this problem, sorry.
