- Post Title: Encrypted .obj file (Please, help)

Hello, one file of a known format of models fell into my hands. That's just the problem, no program wants to work with it. It is clear that everything cannot be so simple, so it turned out to be encrypted. Does anyone have any idea how to decrypt it or convert it to any other format? Thanks in advance for everyone's help
