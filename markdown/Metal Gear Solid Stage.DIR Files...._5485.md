I haven't looked at MGS in a long long time, but I found it much easier to work on the PC version. The majority of stuff is in a ZIP file on the disc that has extension MGZ. Rename, unzip, go. FWIW the names at the top of that STAGE.DIR file are the same as the folders inside this ZIP file. Inside there are, among others, DAR files(these are not quite the same as the DAR files in MGS2), I wrote a really basic ripper for DAR files a few years ago. It goes something like this:
[http://pastie.org/private/stev9va2swdp145gaxmnq](http://pastie.org/private/stev9va2swdp145gaxmnq)
PC version is also nice because it uses PCX format for texture, which is easy to work with. Models are in KMD files which I partly decoded but its been such a long time I couldn't really tell you anything much about them.

Hi Ameneko,

On your page i see a code not a software.

You think it's possible to repack DAR files?

This is my topic about Metal Gear Solid PC:

It's been a while that i dont come here in this forum. After awhile i discovered how the format works.

The adresses must be multiplied by 800h (2048) and then it points correctly to the files inside the container.

are there filenames somewhere? I only see the folder names but I guess I didn't look that hard.

They dont have an extension so don't mind about it...
