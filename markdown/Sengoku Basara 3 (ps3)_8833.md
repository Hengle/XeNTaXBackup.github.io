hello everyone, (i tried the wii version first but in BRRES Viewer some characters had 4 hands and missing body parts)

i switched to the ps3 version and i'm having these errors

textures viewed and exported with noesis, but the model won't work.

You're probably doing something wrong with the Wii version, the models are split but all the files are inside the corresponding model folder.
The PS3 version models are the same as the Wii I believe.

The hands are in a separate file in the same folder as the whole model, the hands with the full model are static, like the face, which is in a separate file too.

Have you tried to export the model? Sometimes it may happen that the viewer doesn't show some parts,but it converts them correctly.
