- Post Title: How do I modify a QuickBMS script to extract newer formats?

Apologies for the vague title. I'm using QuickBMS to extract RSB and RSC files from the Avatar the Last Airbender games, but the scripts I have aren't working for the newer formats of the games after the first one. Is there any way I can modify the script myself to accept the new format and extract them successfully?

Of course you can. :p
Just learn quick bms syntax and modify whatever you want.
