- Post Title: Ken's Rage 2 model import alternatives?

hi, a few days ago I extracted the models from Ken's Rage 2 with chrrox's script, but the models are in .bin, and there's an importer here, but it doesn't work always for every model & doesn't dump the physics, so I ask, are there another ways we can import Ken's Rage 2 models? I'll wait for your answers
