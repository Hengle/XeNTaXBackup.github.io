- Post Title: [iOS][Android] The Amazing Spider-Man .GLA files

Hey, I believe that The Amazing Spider-Man for iOS/Android has their models/textures in archives. There are two notable files called actors.gla and sprites.gla. These files are also used in NOVA series. I am not sure if I am allowed to post them here due to board rules but if you have the game, explore for yourself too. I think it's allowed to PM the files so just ask.
