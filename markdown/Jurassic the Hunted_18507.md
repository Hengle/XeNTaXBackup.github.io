- Post Title: Jurassic the Hunted

a game i've been wanting to extract assets from for quite some time (i'm aware i made another post or two relating to this) but i've had no luck on the file type all the games assets are contained in or finding anyone able to look at it

as for the file containing JTH game assets is a .xds file but im unsure if it is actually a different file type renamed .xds or if it is it's own file type

here is a link to it in my st.ash [https://sta.sh/0wih6eh6tne](https://sta.sh/0wih6eh6tne) i also put this on zenhax incase other people have input to add
