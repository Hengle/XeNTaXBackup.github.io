PSP eboot decrypt tool or TrueAncestor SELF Resigner v1.98 doesn't work on PS VITA Eboot.bin file.
Is there a way to decrypt/encrypt eboot.bin?

Sample eboot.bin [http://www.mediafire.com/download/kx8se ... +eboot.zip](http://www.mediafire.com/download/kx8sebh785ohb5n/ps+vita+eboot.zip)

Thank you. It seems that no one can decrypt eboot.bin from PS VITA yet. And Henkaku does not work on 3.61..
