- Post Title: Final Fantasy 13 - VOICEOVER FILES

I'll get to the point: I want to be able to hear Assimilated Orphan's speech about slaughter and salvation without the extra sound effects and music.

I've managed to get sound effects and battle quotes easily enough and can even preview pre-rendered movies but I just can't find/extract the voice-acting at all.

Isn't there anyone who's done it or has generic expertise that can get me going? The cokeorpepsi50 guy seemed to have done it but he's looong gone..
