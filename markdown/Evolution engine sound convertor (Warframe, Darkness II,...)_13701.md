Evolution engine sound convertor (for games like Warframe, Darkness II, Star Trek, Dark Sector...)

Tested with Darkness II, Star Trek, Warframe & Dark Sector, but may work with all other games.

How to use it:
- Extract all sound files to separate folders with "EvolutionUnpack" tool.
- Choose the game from the dropdown list
- Choose all 3 misc audio folders: H, B, F, those named like H.Misc, e.t.c
- choose an new empty folder for extracted sound.
- Click "convert all".
- Choose all 3 language audio folders: H, B, F, those named like H.Misc_en (for english), or your language
- choose another folder for extracted sound if you wish.
- Click "convert all".

Some files may be in .XWMA format. You can play those if you have proper codecs installed, otherwise use xWMAEncode.exe to convert those to WAV.

Important notes:
- No progress bar. Just wait for the end message.
- No error handling! Be careful.

Well finally something.
Thank you.
I don't know if it works on Dark Sector, becouse it's older engine version.

Thank you very much for your program. But in a game Warframe is not work. Only erorr that does not occur, wait for a long time, and the extract folder is still empty.

New version. Now it extracts ALL the files from Darkness II properly.

If some files are still converted wrong, notify me. I'm gonna check the other evolution games next.

Can anyone send me some samples of .WAV files from H.misc cache? (Warframe)

Ok, the format changed slightly. Is this from the latest version? I hope I won't have to make different tools for different version of one game.

Updated. Warframe support.

You must choose the right game from the list or it will crash.

Now only need to check "dark sector". Is there any other games on this engine?

It seems all of the sounds in Dark Sector are just plain PCM WAV's. If that's the case, then nothing is needed for this game.

Please confirm if the tool is working or not. I need to be sure while I didn't forget how it all works. And then move on to other games.

As for the game Warframe, managed to extract only the audio from folder Music: PCM, ADPCM (Again the layers, both the in Batman), XWMA.
For interest tried to extract audio from folder Sounds, but an error occurred, the program has not found the file "Sounds\Weapons\Corpus\CrpSplitLaser\CrpSplitLaserRetract3DC.wav" and extract stopped.

This may only mean that during the endless updates they messed up their packages, and there's no corresponding F file for the header. Very strange.

I made a workaround, so the tool will continue its work in this case after the error message.

If it helps, I'll update the title post.

Since Dark Sector had some files also split, I decide to support it too.

Because you did something wrong. Music extracted is PERFECTLY CLEAR, because its plain uncompressed PCM.

Read how to use it again, or check your music player.

If nothing helps, describe what are you doing and send the file you get.

Hi Daemon, do not misunderstand I just wanted to say that the music feel good, but some of the background tracks (and not the game's music) you hear a rustling, a strange rustling effect that if I try to slightly increase the volume it feels stronger, which in the game, when I did it, I felt it perfectly clear.

I don't hear any problems in these files. Check you player and soundcard. Also its possible that your card is applying some digital filters in game mode. Anyway, this is what actually contained in game files. Nothing changed. Its not even compressed as I said, its impossible that some problems may be here.

Hello. Can you suggest how can extract audio from this file?
File - [https://mega.nz/#!ndhjBSzS!cEgLXpweY03L ... -WRdkaMwkI](https://mega.nz/#!ndhjBSzS!cEgLXpweY03Lo8M4PvuVTqG3KgRw1j9Yp-WRdkaMwkI)
I extracted the files according to your instructions. Previously, can out to extract all the audio. After a new update, many tracks are not decoded; do not get playable audio. 

```
xWMAEncode output : ERROR: Requested xWMA format unsupported: nSamplesPerSec must be 22050, 32000, 44100 or 48000
CetusAmbient.wav failed with error E_INVALIDARG (Invalid arguments)

And what exactly are the "right" folders? I don't see any B H and F folders. All the .cache files are in one folder (Cache.Windows).

Here for you! 
Actually someone already did this, before compressed game, when you can't extract voices.

In the hopes I'm not making a fool of myself, [sounds like a coming Warframe update will change the audio files entirely](https://twitter.com/sj_sinclair/status/1346947343153844229).

Last "ensmallening" update had you redownload a lot of stuff to replace older bigger versions, so this tool might stop working fully?

Yeah, this might actually break the tool entirely. Oh boy, finger's crossed once that update is pushed out that we are gonna get an updated version of this tool, hopefully?

From which games this tool can extract sounds exactly?
Is there a list or something?

Can confirm, latest update broke it.
