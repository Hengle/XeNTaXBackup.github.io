- Post Title: Terminator Salvation The Arcade Game

Okay so I was rooting around in the install disc for "Terminator Salvation The Arcade Game" by raw Thrills and plytronix when I found what seems to be the 3D model data. Everything else in the files is either a txt,crt,xml or a wav file for all the sounds and dialogue. Nothing is as big as these files are.
As you'll see the main 3D data seems to be in .G3 formate with some in a .GLCGZ format.

 Infranview can seem to look inside these files but as you can see it's like morris code in picture form and so I am stuck. I don't know what engine this is running on but I do know that the game in Linux based. It can install on said based systems but the game doesn't get past boot up due to a dongle being needed so for years it's been in emultion hell and unplayable to anyone without the real arcade unit. Though one can always hope that gets emulated someday and can be played on pc somehow.

 My interest is in gemotry study only. I personally don't care about the texture work, I don't care if the models are in one pose nor do I need bones. If the geometry is accessable that's all I care about. But if somehow we can extract these models in full then awesome. I wouldn't hate sharing the model archives for people who love the Terminator universe,even the less loved titles. So I am not entirely wanting this just for me but I don't know how far we can take this and for now I would be just happy with the 3D models. I'll now post the screenshots of my own dumb work with the format and an example model from the archives. Any help would be greatly appreciated and thank you for your time.
