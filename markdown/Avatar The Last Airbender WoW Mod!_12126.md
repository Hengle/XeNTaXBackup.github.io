- Post Title: Avatar: The Last Airbender WoW Mod!

Greetings, friends. I have recently begun working on a World of Warcraft emulation server based around the world of Avatar: The Last Airbender, which a great deal of people have grew up with, while they were younger- and many still have great love for the series. I have taken a poll on certain forums (none Avatar related), and it shows a vast popularity of the idea.

Now, the reason I am writing, is that a 3D model artist is vital to the completion of the game. We will be including a custom map that depicts the map from the original series very accurately. If anyone is interested in the progression of this project, which scale has never been attempted before in the emulation scene, then please contact me on Skype: vladthecommie

Hope to hear soon!
