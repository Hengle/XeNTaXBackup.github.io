Hi, are there any plans on enabling https for all sections of the forum? Can I help on something to make it happen?

Thanks

Chrome 56 will mark HTTP pages with password fields as non-secure:

Yeah this was a problem for a while it would be really handy if one of the mods could solve this.

firefox have just started doing this to

it makes sense. a secure connection scrambles the traffic, so even if login forms send out passwords in cleartext its just little bit more difficult to capture?

Would be great if Mr Mouse could comment on this, I assume depending of the server this might not be quick or cheap/free. I believe https is pretty important in any site with credentials. I could donate if necessary.

Well, any more comments about https?  
Do you think It's important for the forum?

I'm getting site over HTTP again, Firefox complains it's unsecure.

Even my chrome is not redirecting to https. I think redirects are not set properly.
