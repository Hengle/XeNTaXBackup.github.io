- Post Title: Watch Dogs Legion  [Loc file Tool] ?

Hi guys.
For the Watch Dogs Legion game. Can you make a tool that will import and export the loc file?

[https://www.mediafire.com/file/5uelrdap ... h.loc/file](https://www.mediafire.com/file/5uelrdapujmuea8/main_english.loc/file)

The language file for localization is included in it, but there is no tool to open it.
