- Post Title: Mafia II 3D models.

OK, so I decided to bring this up just in case some of you peeps are still interested in modding Mafia II; the Mafia modding scene seems to be a little stale nowadays, so why not spark things up a little?

OK, I'm no reverse-engineer, but from what I've observed most of the dynamic objects ingame are controlled by skeletal animation (even the cars have bones, which is a PITA since Zmodeler, a modeling tool usually used for ingame vehicles, does not support skeletal anims afaik). The only other thing that still bothers me is that we haven't managed to make a workable exporter for us to make custom meshes. I mean like come on, the guys at GTAF have ported the San Andreas map to IV, and yet we only managed to retexture stuff and shove LUA scripts to Mafia?

Yeah, but that only allows you to convert from Mafia II, not to the game.
