- Post Title: Titanium Warriors (Chinese private Spiral Knights server) - rsrc.raz and rsrc.raz.block file

Greetings, John here.

I just installed Titanium Warriors, a chinese Spiral Knights private server with new content.

I need to figure out how to open rsrc.raz and rsrc.raz.block file on Titanium Warriors game files.

If i noticed there was a java file that has lot of texts related to chinese language, I could edit it to translate chinese to english.

Here's a google drive link to rar consisting of 4 files:[https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ViuhIE ... sp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ViuhIEckTnCBxt4UySx8IJsXC5c1Y8Fx/view?usp=sharing)

I thought copy of the files were deleted after they were added to rar.
