- Post Title: LZSS Compression?

I'm looking into making a program that opens and allows editing of the .FSYS files from Pok√©mon Colosseum. The compression, LZSS, is confusing and I can't make heads or tails of it. Any help would be awesome.

I found this on the wiki

Well, that's extremely useful, thank you, but I don't know any of the parameters. I'll have to look through the files again and look for similarities.
Edit: The second link on the wiki doesn't work.

A question, what programming language is this?

while InputPos < InputSize do
begin
  FlagByte := Input[InputPos++]
  for i := 1 to 8 do
  begin
    if (FlagByte and 1) = 0 then
    begin
      OfsLen := Input[InputPos] + Input[InputPos + 1] shl 8
      InputPos += 2
      if OfsLen = 0 then
        Exit;
      Length := OfsLen and LengthMask + Threshold
      Offset := (BufPos - (OfsLen shr LengthBits)) and (N - 1)
      { copy Length bytes from Buffer[Offset] onwards while increasing BufPos }
    end
    else
    begin
      { copy 1 byte from Input[InputPos] }
      InputPos += 1
    end
    FlagByte := FlagByte shr 1
  end
end

that is a general outline of what has to be translated into whatever language you program with.

Quickbms has a couple lz77 variants if you're not interested in figuring out how lz77 works (eg: doing it yourself) and just throwing a bunch of different algorithms at it.

Quickbms? I haven't heard of that program...
