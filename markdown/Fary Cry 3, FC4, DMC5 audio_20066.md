- Post Title: Fary Cry 3, FC4, DMC5 audio?

Does anyone have voice audio files for Far Cry 3, Far Cry 4 and Devil May Cry 5? I'm trying to learn how to extract voice clips to make character compilations but so far it's been pretty complicated for me ;;; Any help on the request or tips for audio extraction are greatly appreciated.

There's no real easy way to explain the ripping for it, when we don't know what the file system is like... Sorry lol.
