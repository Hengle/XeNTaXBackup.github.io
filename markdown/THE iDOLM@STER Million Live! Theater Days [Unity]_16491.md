Model extract very easy with Unity Studio, but anyone can find the way download exactly raw data like deresute? Tks

That would be useful, since there's no "manifest" this time.

You don't need the manifest. Go to matsurihi.me's API, search for any SSR/SR with costume, and there is a costume model ID. 

Use MLTD asset downloader. The models are under cb and ch (body and head respectively), and they're named after the costume model ID. 
Pr are all casual wear, cr and tr are training T-shirts, ex are common costumes, sr are event/SR costumes and gs are costumes for Shika & Leon. Check out chara_costume_release and determine which SR model is which by deduction.
