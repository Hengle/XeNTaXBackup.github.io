- Post Title: WRC 6 .PTX Texture Files

Hi everybody, I've tried convert to .dds the textures from this game, but the only i get from this file is a .Rif file, I opened in Hex and find the words Riff and DTX1.

Here's a sample:

Best Regards.

your sample is lz4f compressed, here is bms script to decompress it.  

```

comtype lz4f
get ZSIZE asize
goto 0x11
get SIZE long
math SIZE + 8
get NAME basename
get EXT extension
string NAME + _decomp.
string NAME + EXT
clog NAME 0 ZSIZE SIZE
```


i need more than one sample to compare for a script to open decompressed texture.

Will you take a look at some TT Isle of Man PTX files from the same devs?

Thanks, it works on these smaller files but the script seems to have issues with the bigger sized textures. The bikes for example (around 21MB) show this error:
