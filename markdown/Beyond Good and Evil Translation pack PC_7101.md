[https://www.dropbox.com/s/h96cihuywrfj3 ... ck.7z?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/h96cihuywrfj3i9/bge_pack.7z?dl=0)  (7.7MB)

The pack contain:
- Xpert2 + BGE plugin (both are free)
- my tools (BGE02, BGECount), at least .Net 2.0 required
- unp2bin - bin repacker, created by CHEATER
- English files, unpacked english files and extracted texts
- Readme (Read this before you start!)

The tools can edit the ps2/xbox files. (Say, if you need those unpacked english files.) But the BF plugin can't handle the new Beyond Good and Evil HD Xbox360 version!

Hello

How can I extract and repack audio?
  (for a successful language change).
