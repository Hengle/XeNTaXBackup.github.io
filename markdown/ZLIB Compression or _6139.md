- Post Title: ZLIB Compression or ?

that 78 9c is at for sure zlib
the fact that it can't be decompressed correctly could be caused by a possible customization of the zlib algorithm (that is perfectly possible by switching the internal decompression routines, I found this solution in poweriso) or the performing of other additional decryptions.

maybe in your case you could opt for the direct usage of the functions of the game dumped manually (not simple) but for the moment is probably better if you try a bump on the original Dragonica thread:

Thanks aluigi for answer after 2 hours successfully decompressed  

Original size's

tb.bin - 2,45 MB (2 572 643 bytes)
tb2.bin - 3,85 MB (4 041 314 bytes)

After Decrypting

tb.bin - 2,45 MB (2 572 508 bytes)
tb2.bin - 3,85 MB (4 041 179 bytes)

And after Decompressing

tb.bin - 22,4 MB (23 490 950 bytes)  
tb2.bin - 5,97 MB (6 265 628 bytes)
