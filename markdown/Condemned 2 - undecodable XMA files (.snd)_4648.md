Ive converted a few of these from the snds, the beginning stream is that 80000 and it can vary between sample rates and stereo to mono. you can find them in the header and hey mjaybe create a script that extracts these snds and use the sounddata file to find the file names, but im getting a little  ahead of myself here

So you're saying toWAV doesn't care if the filling blocks are 0xFF or 0x07? What about the file I uploaded? Can you decode it?

Thanx about the filler info. Unfortunately that info doesn't help me to extract the files from the *.snd archives. :-\

Shouldn't the header contain segment count?

I need someone with quickBMS skills here! Not someone who just babbles and doesn't help! Sorry Orange but that's what you're just doing.

Why don't you just man up and stop being so defensive all the time, this isn't the first time you have harshly criticized me or anyone else that has said about you. Im just trying to keep the topic alive to see if anyone gathers any interests. However here you are saying that i babble too much and don't help, well it may not help you, i don't know anything about bms scripting, doesn't mean im not allowed to post in the topic, stop acting like you can push everyone around to your standards and grow a pair. getting fed up with you always.

But i will let an admin deal with it.

What a senselessness. Stop bickering. Alpha, I personally think you started this quarrel, when OrangeC was just giving his input into the matter. Saying someone is babbling at that point is not nice. Orange calling you a faggot because of that, well, perhaps he could have used another term, but you started it. Now shake hands and get back to topic.
