- Post Title: Xenoblade 2 Tora.bin

Hey there! I was mucking around in the Xenoblade 2 game files and found a file called 'tora.bin' in the 'minigames' folder. Is this the file to 'Tiger! Tiger!'? If so, is there anything that can be done with it? (Excecution, extracting, etc...) Any answers would be kindly appreciated!

I know that this post is pretty old now, but I wanted to share with you what I found out about the file's format. My notes are a bit scattered though, so be warned.

I updated it to be public, so it should be viewable now.
