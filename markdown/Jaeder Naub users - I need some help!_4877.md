- Post Title: Jaeder Naub users - I need some help!

First. Hi, long time no see. Ive been experimenting with new ideas on how to make scanning more efficient
and optimized, and have now released experimental builds for this new technique.
the problem with this is that ive practically remade the whole scanner from scratch, this is a problem
because i cannot check that everything that worked before is working now.

So everyone who is a regular user of jaeder naub, please download 2.2.3U and use it as you used the older versions,
and report to me if some format is NOT working properly that did work in earlier versions, such as 2.2.0a.

Why is this in Holy Cow? , Well, the new scanner is highly efficient (pre-scanner only at the moment, the ripper itself is slower at the moment),
ive managed to scan files in up to 130MB/s at the moment, (this is ofcourse highly dependable on the contents of the file, but i can assure you the file wasnt just Nulls)
, so what does this mean? , it means that in current state the scanner is more than 1000% faster than previous generations, now practically
fast enough to saturate your diskdrive speeds. (if your CPU is fast enough)

another Holy Cow with this new engine is that it wont get slower by adding new formats. thats how it works, i can add 1000 more formats to be detected
and it wont slow it down one bit. in contrast to the old "Scan Byte, Check if it resembles something that looks like a file, Tag this place as possible file".

And this is for the pre-scanner only at the moment, Jaederstorm.exe , the filedumper is not optimized at the moment, but this means faster
scanning of files to check if there is something rippable in them.

any information about formats that doesnt work in the new engine is of help! so if you have the time, its appreciated!

NOTE: I have no idea how the Dual Core version works on a single core system at the moment, maybe it will crash like hell.

Also, does the speed now compare with [Game File Explorer's](http://mirrored.xentax.com/gfe)? (as a side note, it's really a good thing we archived/mirrored that, since Geocities isn't around any more...)

Im going to download some other rippers and make some fair comparisons.
Allready working on new fixes in a yet unreleased jaeder naub, with more speed ups to the actual dumping, and enabling of some formats that broke when making the new engine.

Edit: Tested Game File Explorer, and it is faster, but not by much :DDDD , but in all honesty, GFE detects BMP and WAV. 
im now however triggered to make it faster than GFE even if you scan with all 250+ formats enabled. so stay tuned. this means war.

(another note, GFE seemed to skip files when scanning through a F.E.A.R archive, JN found 1042 WAV files, and GFE found 970, im investigation this so its not an actual error on JNs part).

That sounds like something I would do...  

Now that I saw the video, it is pure awesome. You should upload it (or rather, a higher-quality version of it) to YouTube; it would make great publicity.
