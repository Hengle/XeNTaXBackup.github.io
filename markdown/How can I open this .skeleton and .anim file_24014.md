- Post Title: How can I open this .skeleton and .anim file?

Hello, 

I have two file in attachments. One is act_10.skeleton, contain skeleton data. Another is idle_a_01.anim, example of animation. But don't know how to open it. We can read all data in hex as it not encrypt. Hope anyone will interest in this and help me know how to open skeleton and apply animation to it.

Thank you and have a nice day.

you could try to transform the following into an smd file, not too hard but tedious.
Looks like: bone_name, 3x3 rot matrix and position (x,y,z):

But you'll need the complete list of bone names before, dunno why there are so many "pelvis" lines. 
edit: ok, Pelvis_08/Pelvis_02 seems to be mirrored, maybe it's upper_legs, left/right?
