- Post Title: WWE Raw for PC game

really feel like a leech asking this in the first post i make but here goes.
WWE Raw for PC 2002 is a really old game which people still mod and play due to the lack of decent pc wrestling games(we still have a guide done by brianJ).the game 3d modes are in a format called FML. my question is there any programme that can edit or convert this? we have tried to edit the file with a hex editor but that is not a good way to edit this. so any help?

While I respect your obvious dedication, that game is pretty horrible, but if you just HAVE to have a PC wrestling game, the ones made by M. Dickie are better (which isn't saying much) and allow easy customization.  Heck, maybe just wait for ProWrestlingX to come out, it should be out by the year 2050, and I'm sure with the same crappy modeling and animation that they currently have in their betas.

But seriously,  I recommend you just get a JTAG Xbox 360 and hack the SvR series and WWE12 game, it's much better.  I wrote a tutorial for WWE Raw modding years ago, and it's kind of neat people still use it, but also sad at the same time.  I quit bothering with that game about 7 years ago, and I wouldn't know where to start helping you, or even remember half of what I did DO.  All I can recommend is getting chrrox to maybe help with the model formats, as he's really great with models.  Hopefully he sees this post and might help you, I'll put in the good word for you that you are one dedicated MF'er.

Good Luck, and I hope you are at least having fun with that game.

thanks for the reply yes the game sucks but the graphics and control's are still pretty much decent.If you have time check out a forum called "The wreck room" that is the official modding site for this game.hopefully someone might be able to shed some light on this.

You can post some samples. Maybe someone will look at it (bored, looking for challenge, genuinely want to help, etc).

If I had ever learned models better and figured out the model format, I'd definitely help you, but unfortunately I have done neither.  chrrox is usually interested in figuring out new formats, but not sure if he'd be interested in the models from this game, they aren't really great, and he can get better models from the newer games.
