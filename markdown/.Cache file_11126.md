There's not much interesting to export from this file. And I also don't think that repacking would make much sense.

It consists of thumbnails* and paths to textures and assets (tga, png, adf, epe).
*usually 128x128 pixels, uncompressed RGB (= 3 bytes per pixel)

The actual textures and 3d objects are not stored in this file.

For example:
objects\barricade\oiltank\_textures\texture_DF.tga
objects\barricade\oiltank\asset.adf



oiltank.bmp (48.05 KiB) Viewed 139 times

(I added the BMP header and reversed the byte order)
