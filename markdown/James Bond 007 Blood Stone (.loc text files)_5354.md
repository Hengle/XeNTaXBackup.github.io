The text format seem very easy but it looks like it has some kind of crc check on any string (and on the archive too btw)

Will the translation work without recompiling .loc files back?

As far as I know, you have to recompress again all the .loc files into the .pak file.

If so, a .loc tool will be useless unless someone first develops a .pak recompressor.

Hi, Jurko!
If you have enough information about the file that you've mentioned above to be able to create a tool, I can create one for you.
