- Post Title: .s3d model

Hello I were trying to get the 3d model from this filetype, I was able to identify some values, but my start vertices address was wrong, I was using hex2obj.A guy from discord (Champollion) help me with the values for the mesh, but still need to know how to get the UV address and also understand that value of the padding, because I tried to replicate the values in hex2obj, but the mesh doesn't load correctly. Any kind of help is well appreciated thanks!
