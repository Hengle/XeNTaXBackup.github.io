- Post Title: Bad normals | Flyff .O3D Format

Hello, i make it quick.

There is a ModelEditor called "Atools" that can open .o3d and save them to .dae, which works great.

But im not sure in one thing, are Flyffs modells really that bad that all of the normals are wrong ? Some models just have complelty inverted normals, some are like 60% are normal, 40% are wrong direction, etc etc.

Any help would be appreciated, thanks!

/edit what I found out is that the tool called o3dconverter v3 can convert it to .obj and the normals work! 

So what is the issue?
