- Post Title: Cyberpunk 2077 NPC characters not found and which V mesh

I've uncooked all the meshes and can't seem to find several characters. 

The list so far:
Spyder Murphy
Shaitan
Meridith Stout
The CyberBike Assassins from act 2 that try to kill Goro and you.

I've used both wolvenkit and cp77tools to locate them in the archives with no luck. I saw someone found Meridith. Anyone have an idea?

And does Abernathy have a mesh?

Any way to reassemble NPCs that are made from the parts file that are not main NPCs

Also for V, anyway to figure out your characters custom settings and use those to build a mesh of your character or to inject alterations?
