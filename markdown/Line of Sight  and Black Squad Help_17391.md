- Post Title: Line of Sight  and Black Squad Help

I have been searching for ways to get the model files out of the  games Line of Sight  and Black Squad    but i never found a way to make the files work with the extractor  Umodel.
They are both Unreal engine and have .upk  files but they can't be opened    

Can anyone help?
