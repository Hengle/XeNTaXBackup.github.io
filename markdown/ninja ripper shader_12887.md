- Post Title: ninja ripper shader

Hi, I am new to ripping game models, and have no background in 3DS Max.

I am trying to rip a game model from TEATIME Love Death Final to use in Unity 5.0,
and will probably hire a freelance modeller to help me rig the ripped model.

This is the screen I ripped from:


And this is what I got:


May I know how to get the Shaders and things required into 3DS Max
so it will render exactly the same as the game screen?

Also, how hard will it be to rig the meshes into a model with bones?
Hope you guys are help me here. Thanks in advance!
