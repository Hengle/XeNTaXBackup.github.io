- Post Title: Unreal Engine can be forced to play always english voices?

Hi all.

It seems that games that uses UnrealEngine can be modified to force the engine to load other localized language of the main one set; that way, we can set the game on english, and by modify one game file it will load X language subtitles, for example, spanish. For that, i have uploaded a package that contains 2 UnrealEngine games: Mortal Kombat 9 and Batman Arkham Asylum. 

The game that have that file is MK9. I don't know who create that mod file [Coalesced (Modified).eng], but it works perfect; the game have english like language set (voices), but subtitles, strings and menus are on spanish. I have compared the two files (Coalesced.eng) on a Hex editor and the whole file seems to be different so i don't know what was the main change.

Also, i include in that package the files i believe do the same work (load localized subtitles/voices) for BatmanAA. Here is the link: [http://www.mediafire.com/download/vsnt5 ... _Games.zip](http://www.mediafire.com/download/vsnt55c1ba94awk/UnrealEngine_Games.zip)
