Use [OffZip](http://aluigi.altervista.org/mytoolz.htm) with -a texture_file_name folder_to_extract_to 0 arguments.
The format is not PNG, there are 5 files inside, and they don't appear to be PNG even when connected using hex editor.

Once you extract the contents of the *.tex file (which look like LODs of the same image) you can open them in TextureFinder2.1 (8888 = 24+8) then save a bmp capture which will also preserve the alpha if it exists. 
At 512x256 this is the highest resolution of the image contained in distantfence_d.png.tex
