Very cool (and the "Crechs!" game sounds a lot like "Creatures"); you should add a link to this page from the "Pages" section of the sidebar.

Crechs! is not a game though. A simulation.

You're right, of course, and so is Creatures. I tend to treat simulations as games (and there's plenty of crossover between the two, depending where you look), hence my use of incorrect terminology.

Okay, recaptcha finally works. Let's see about that sortable captcha.

Damn, that recaptha still does not keep out those fuckers. I'm guessing they are human trash, though. I will try and get that sortable captcha thing in, though I doubt it will keep out the human scum.

I've noticed the same on Jurassic Park Terror, even after upgrading to 3.0.8. There must be a spammer somewhere who's cracked the ReCAPTCHA system somehow. 

Still, it's only a trickle, and as long as you're diligent about blocking the domains used in the accounts' email addresses, you can control it even further. (I suspect you'd also see some actionable patterns if you tracked the IPs of the accounts, but haven't done so myself at JPT (it doesn't help matters in that regard that our solution there is to just delete the account))

Okay, I've now installed a new captcha. For some reason the sort shows above instead of below the other fields. But it works. Let's see if that keeps the bitches out.

By using sortable captcha along with a custom profile field, which you set up to only be needed at registration with a simple question of "Are you a spam-bot?" and default answer of no, I have zero spam bots now.  I actually had zero before the extra custom profile field, but I heard it helps too.

Installed a better sortables captcha. The other one was half baked and buggy.

As an aside, phpbb has a horrible plugin system that encourages bad coding practices.

Also, should we [s]have an open invitation for an outright "this forum is better than that" flamewar[/s] start taking suggestions for better forum software?

Migrating the forum is unfortunately not an option for us at this point in time.

Lives, work, other stuff to do. A migration is never clean and quite an intensive process.

edit: after my recent experiences with phpbb, I am seriously entertaining the thought of migrating though. Hacking phpbb is bad for my mental health.

I also think that we may examine the idea to migrate. We can search the internet for the best forum, and then search for easy tools to do this. However, the process may be extremely time-consuming, so will take an undefined period of time, and the process should also be thorough, we do not wish to lose any shared information.

Stupid question, perhaps, but wouldn't the host be able to help with a migration?

And a new one. [http://www.xentax.com/?p=300](http://www.xentax.com/?p=300) I've added a splash screen also with a new SID tune of mine. Well, it was done halfway 2010, but never got round to finish it. So I might as well use it as is.

For some reason our forum defaulted to the old style. We are looking into this matter why this happened. That's why we had to disable it for a while. We will continue to monitor activities of the forum and take heed of any suspicious behaviour. Meanwhile, we will look into other options in terms of forum software. phpbb has crossed us for the last time.

You could direct those to Craptain, as he's the one that is examining options to handle a migration.

Ugh I don't like to hear that, but thanks for the heads up. What's worse: the templating system is database only so I can't use an IDE to speed up development. Why do people insist on putting static content in the database?
