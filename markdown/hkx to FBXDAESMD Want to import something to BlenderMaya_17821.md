- Post Title: hkx to FBX/DAE/SMD? Want to import something to Blender/Maya

Hey Guys, right now I'm working on some stuff.

I extracted a sklb and a pap file from Final Fantasy XIV which can be converted to HKX.
I just downloaded the Havok Content Tools 2014.1.1.1 (32bit, since 64bit crashes).
The Skeleton (sklb) and the Animation (pap) works without problems in Havok Content Tools.

But I'm unable to export it as FBX or any other File, which can be loaded with Maya or Blender.

I've tried different tools but none of these worked.

I've uploaded a xml which can be loaded with Havok Content Tools.

Could you help me out with that please?

EDIT:
Linked a Model of the Carbuncle as FBX file.
Would like to get the Animation to work with this model.

Would be AWESOME if you could help me out with that
