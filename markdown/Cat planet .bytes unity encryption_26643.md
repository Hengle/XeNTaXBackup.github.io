Unity game, I can provide an account if anyone's willing to dig into it (as this game is usually blocked outside of cn(but assets are downloadable on launch without need of account).

Were you able to get any success? I have encountered quite a few CN unity games using this particular encryption method. They have the first 1k bytes encrypted after the header, and all seem to use the same algorithm as you can see that 00 is replaced with A6 around offset 0xD0. However I am not smart enough to figure out the exact method they were using.
If anyone is interested, there is an encrypted file and an unencrypted bundle from some other game in the attachments for comparison.

Update 8/11:
After some research, I discovered that those games are encrypted by Netease's safety product 易盾, so the encryption is probably non-trivial  .
