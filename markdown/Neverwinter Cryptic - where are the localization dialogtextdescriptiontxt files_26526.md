- Post Title: Neverwinter Cryptic - where are the localization /dialog/text/description/txt files?

Hi, thanks to [viewtopic.php?p=34672#p34672](https://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?p=34672#p34672) I'm able to extract all the .hogg files from Neverwinter but I can't figure out where the localization files might be and in which format. Does anybody have any clue?

Or does that stuff get streamed?

Since these probably have the same formats, I'll include them for search:
Magic: Legends 2021
Star Trek Online 2010
Champions Online 2009
City of Heroes 2004
