- Post Title: File .awb extract and compressed

Hi, I'm new, I extracted a file of a .awb game and the folder appeared with many .bin files with the same name and named ".awb.00000" up to ".awb.00085", how can I proceed to to extract these files?
Place a file here for you to see how it's done.

The demo file you provided is encoded with CRI ADX ADPCM.

Simply rename the file from '.bin' to '.adx' and use vgmstream to playback / convert
