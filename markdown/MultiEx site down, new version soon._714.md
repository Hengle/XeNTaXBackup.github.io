- Post Title: MultiEx site down, new version soon.

[EDIT: FIXED]

The site for MultiEx processing is down, so you can't run the program.   

I will release a new version soon, that will not need to operate from a site anymore. 

Please have patience. 

All will be well in a couple of days. Bare with me.
