- Post Title: Operation Flashpoint Dragon Rising - extracting xml problem

Hi, I want to ask for help with 1 certain file called gometadata.xml I need this one file for adding custom templates to the game's EntityDatabase. I've started thread about it in CM forums, but we got stuck and somebody suggested me asking for help here, there is link to the thread: [http://community.codemasters.com/forum/ ... em-ui.html](http://community.codemasters.com/forum/operation-flashpoint-dragon-rising-mission-editing-modding-chat-zone-123/475380-new-templates-entitydatabase-problem-ui.html) Summarized, I've extracted game files by using QuickBMS, I've followed this tutorial: [http://community.codemasters.com/forum/ ... files.html](http://community.codemasters.com/forum/operation-flashpoint-dragon-rising-mission-editing-modding-chat-zone-123/386115-tutorial-how-extract-win_000-000-files.html). But some of the files (bigger ones) have bugged code, as I said I'm interested in 1 certain file, I'm posting link to extracted folder with this file: [http://filebeam.com/fb2c0f236798d344b0cd8d6c0b2e1837](http://filebeam.com/fb2c0f236798d344b0cd8d6c0b2e1837)

I have similar file as an example, it's size is also big as for xml file and I've extracted it with errors in code. Somehow another user (TemplarGFX), which was modding this game had this file extracted/modded correctly. Unfortunately I can't contact him. I'm posting link to that file as an example (with both versions, his modded file and extracted by me using QuickBMS): [http://filebeam.com/download.php?file=a ... c417940d6a](http://filebeam.com/download.php?file=a6739ad673e742f45718d6c417940d6a)

Thanks for any help.
