- Post Title: Way to generate resS file from unity game files

Hi all,
A friend of mine is modding a game that was made in unity and he can extract files properly but he cant generate the resS files that apparently are auto generated, so extracting is not the problem but injecting these in the game again, from what I researched I found some unity versions changed and when exporting resources in StreamingAssets folder make these resS files but of course he needs the exact same resS file generated so Im clueless, could you please tell me what tool is needed for that? Thanks a lot beforehand and Im sorry is question is not well defined =).
