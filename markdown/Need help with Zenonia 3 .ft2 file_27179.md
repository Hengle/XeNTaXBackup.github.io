- Post Title: Need help with Zenonia 3 .ft2 file

Hi, Is there any way to open and edit this font file? Also, is it possible to convert it to .ttf or any common font file extension? 
I tried looking for the same case and found this ([viewtopic.php?t=25730](https://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?t=25730)) but it doesn't work.

Here's the sample font: [https://mega.nz/file/gq8EQQyC#82ioeD0lN ... CpUkQK6Exo](https://mega.nz/file/gq8EQQyC#82ioeD0lN0pQT1hX7IgdINhHlcu4z-oheCpUkQK6Exo)
Thanks
