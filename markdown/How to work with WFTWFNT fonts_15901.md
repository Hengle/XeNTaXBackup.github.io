I have a game that uses a peculiar font format. I couldn't open it up in any font software I know. Could anyone, please, figure out what type of file these are?

Cracked it (kind of)

There's a program called SignPro that can open them, there's a free trial on their website.

You have to put the font files in the correct directory which is somewhere like User/AppRoaming/SignPro/SignFonts

The fonts I was trying to open are for memorial masonry but I hope this method works for you

Well, it's worth a try. Do you have a link? SignPro is a pretty generic search.
