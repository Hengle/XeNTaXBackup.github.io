Sorry for my bad english
OK. I create a tutorial how to extract fonts from this file patchdynamic0.megapack
1.Open patchdynamic0.megapack in any hex editor(I use Hex Editor Neo)
2.
Copy selected bytes from this file.

3.
Paste selected bytes to any file and save

4.
Delete selected bytes from original file.

5.
Use Simplyzip and decompress this file.

6.
Open decompressed original file and backup file.

7.
Copy last 8 bytes from backup file.

8.
Insert last 8 bytes from backup file to original simplyzip decompressed file.


9.Save file.
10.Rename from patchdynamic0 to patchdynamic0.CFX
And fonts are extracted
