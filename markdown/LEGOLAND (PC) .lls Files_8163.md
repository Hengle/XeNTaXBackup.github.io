- Post Title: LEGOLAND (PC) .lls Files

I was trying to rip the graphics from the game LEGOLAND, but when I unarchived the graphics resource files, I found that most of the graphics were in a non-standard graphics format (.lls). Could someone please help me convert these graphics to a standard file format (e.g. .bmp, .png, .jpg)? I would greatly appreciate it. I reposted this here because I suspect it might be compressed or encrypted.

Download all the .lls files from Graphics1.res: [http://www.mediafire.com/download.php?f45t0xpbvf0hb47](http://www.mediafire.com/download.php?f45t0xpbvf0hb47)
