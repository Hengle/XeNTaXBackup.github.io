- Post Title: Ripping models from Soulcalbiur 4

Hi everyone! I was wondering if it was possible to rip models from Soulcalibur 4. And I don't really mean the main character models, more like character creation models. I've read/seen elsewhere of models being extracted from SC4 but they've only been the main character mods. I have Noesis too. If anyone has an idea, please let me know. Thanks!

R_All files are the normal characters and the others in the creation folders are parts for the character creation parts. I said it's possible, but building a single character from docens of parts to choose is gonna be a pain in the ass.
