- Post Title: The Order 1886

The Order 1886 tool
This tool works for skinned meshes: characters, weapons etc. For map tool - look below.

Usage:
Game files have no proper names. Model assets are in 3861c21fc34b7612 folder, raw data files for them (for those which have it, including models) are in GPU folder. Since asset & raw file is called the same, you have to do the following:
1. rename files from GPU folder to *.RAW
2. place corresponding files (or all files) in the same folder
3. drag any of them onto the tool (or use batch/command files)

Notes:
- oodle dll will be needed for the tool to work (usually called oo2core_5_win64.dll or so)
- some rare bones may have scales, and may not work properly
- physics engine is complex, so some cloth parts may not work properly





facial:


lots of cloth bones:

Btw, I tried it; Lots of files crash when reading the cloth nodes or something like that, creating smd files with 0kb size.
There is also some extracted smd that do not work at all.
And some textures are bad, but I'm pretty sure this is well known.

These are static/level files. They dont have cloth. Also textures are only broken in levels.

All characters must work. I dont have plans to fix levels now.

Anybody else who tried getting static/maps from this game? :p
I got help from the professionals here but we ended up nowhere.

It seems to be a hard format to tackle.
Since I have no hope of daemon returning to this, I'm looking for anybody who is nuts enough to try this.
I need a static+texture exporter (architecture pieces, furniture etc) for this game. Doesnt have to be fancy, just something that works.

1K usd on Paypal. (and I can only do paypal)
No bs, no fooling around.

Tons of samples: [https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/ ... sp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1qYwuuyYyPvBG8UdQbV394pW9lJZDlXwA?usp=sharing)

Doing good and you?

Still no joy on 1886 tho. 
Thought 1k bounty would fix that, but nah! It's probably too tricky.
Even their other games are really complicated it seems.
Still hoping you return to this one day before 2086.

I am playing it right now, architecture seems fun. Closest comparison I can name is Assassin's Creed: Unity.

I been looking into getting the world data to this title. Here are a few things I found.
I used Aluigi's script for The Order 1886 to make .unpacked files.

Looking at the data i did start to see patterns.
[](https://ibb.co/1QwWFHT)

Im now not 100% if this mesh exported with daemons tool or not but either way this is from the raw data. So there might be hope for the levels. I will look more into it.

Nope, this was not exported haha

daemon's tool only exports skinned meshes and their textures.
everything else is broken/ignored.

Interesting. I find it odd that the levels are in little endian being a console game. I will try to get a stage item there dont seem to be any real pattern within the data. Im sure there is a header at the top with some info about the meshes. But this tree was just a random model i seen.

ok i'm back and already got whole maps loaded
it only needed a few small tweaks to fix
i still need to do something about texture auto-assigning, because there are 100s of meshes there for a typical map
must not take long

Map tool.
I had no time to make a universal tool for both skeletal and static meshes, so i made a separate map tool.
I had to switch off physics for map tool, so skeletal meshes exported may be incomplete or broken. Use old skeletal tool in this case.

Usage:
Model assets are in 3861c21fc34b7612 folder, raw data files for them are in GPU folder.
For maps, you will also need external texture streams, which is 4c7002f42ce0da08 folder.
1. rename folder with external texture streams to just "streams" and place it next to the tool.
2. rename files from GPU folder to *.RAW
3. place corresponding asset and .RAW files in the same folder
4. drag any of them (asset or .RAW) onto the tool (or use batch/command files)

About 220 of all asset packages contain maps. For them, tool will export these files:
- ascii file with base meshes (including skeletal parts)
- smd file with base meshes (including skeletal parts)
- ascii file with instanced meshes, if present (level props and other repeating things)
- layout files with a list of all shaders (debug output, you dont need it)
- material files with a list of all textures used in each mesh and their types
- all textures used in a map will be exported to "textures" subfolder, so it will hold all textures for all maps in one place

ASCII files will have 2 main texture types auto-assigned (main diffuse & main normal)

After that you can use included blender plugin made by SecaProject to load the map.

Any version after 2.8 should work.
What model are you trying to load? Maybe something skeletal?

hmm, you absolutely right, map piece like "0031822db1b79b7b_models\0031822DB1B79B7B_i.ascii" loaded fine, while a head of Tesla did not load "58db850296bd728e_models\9E913966CECDAF0C.ascii"

hey i was wondering if you could help me with something. the engine this game uses is also used on another game called "echo vr" and was wondering if your tool would work on that too, or is it designed to specifically only work on The Order 1886? if you can, can you message me on discord if this is possible, as i dont use this site often.

Lone echo 1 and 2 were also built on the same engine as this game. Would the tool work on them too in theory and if not would it be a lot of work to get it working?

you can never tell, sometimes games on the same engine are very different, sometimes exactly same.

Sorry to crash this party with a dumb question.
I have loved the artstyle of this game since it came out and just got around to try and see if I could extract some models for personal use.
I am having some trouble getting to the files on which I would use this tool.

How do you guys get there?
Do you put the disc in your pc, or do you get the files straight from your PS4 somehow?
Do you unpack something with quickbms, and in that case what? (I have used quickbms before, so that part I should hopefully be able to figure out.)

Again, sorry. I feel like I should be able to figure this out, but I am simply not :/

Alright, I have unpacked a .pkg file, yay me.
I THINK that I have followed the instructions for each tool correctly, however, when I try to use the tools on any of the files, I get the folders for models and textures correctly, but no files are placed within them.

Is 776 the correct number of files to have in 3861c21fc34b7612 and GPU?
I have placed the files (without extension from 3861c21fc34b7612 and .RAW from GPU) in the same folder, OUTSIDE the unpacked directory from the .pkg file.
I have placed oo2core_5_win64.dll in the directory of each tool.

If any of the above is incorrect, please let me know.

Hi Everyone, 

I have .FBX files of all maps and game models from The Order 1886, as well as a folder with all of the textures, I just have no clue which textures go with which model as none of them are attached or labeled. Are there any tools that can help with this? 

Thanks.

- Post Title: Re: The Order 1886

Sorry for reposting, I did not recieve an answer last time.

I have unpacked the game sucessfully and followed the steps as laid out in original post.
However, when I attempt to unpack any of the gamefiles, regardless fo whether i choose the extensionless file, the *.RAW file, or both, I get folders for models and textures, but no files in them.
I have tried both tools, and the result is the same (with the texture folder being simply named 'textures' when using the maps tool).
I have attempted this with two different versions of oo2core_5_win64.dll.
Any Idea what I might be doing wrong?

if anything goes wrong, you should get an error message
either run from command line, or check windows application event log
then if you find whats the problem, we can try to help you

I have successfully found the windows application event log (which i did not know was a thing that existed, you learn something everyday...), and have attached a screenshot of what I assume to be the useful information about an event I just provoked.
It does not seem to be an 'error' event in the log, but rather and 'information' event.

Thank you for you help and your time 

EDIT: I will gladly try running from command line, but do not know the syntax for doing so, and I am not smart enough to happen upon it myself.
If you will provide a syntax example, I can try command line...

yes this is actual error message, "end of stream" exception, which means something is really wrong.
looks like that you're trying to export wrong file, not a map file.

Makes sense, here is a screenshot of trying the same file in the regular tool.
Both examples I have given are simply the top file in the folder, named 0a440684b4959c03.

If some files are simply not meant to work, I apologise for my misunderstanding.
Would you be able to provide a name for a file you can unpack on your end?
Then I could try that one...

Assuming you did ALL required steps in initial post by daemon, where the tool and files are, at the top in the address bar of the windows explorer, (not where the search bar is on the right) type "cmd" and hit enter on the keyboard, the cmd window will open and type the following

```
for %G in (*.raw) do 1886_maps.exe "%G"
```

The process should start immediately, if steps are NOT performed correct from beginning this way you'll see actual error displayed.
Or you can make an empty text file, paste inside:

```
pause
```

this time the "%" is doubled, change extension from .txt to .bat then run that bat file by double clicking on it like you would any executable.
either way you choose to run it the result will be identical.
That way you'll know what is going on.

And as daemon said, you probably tried the process on a wrong file, so make sure you pay close attention on what your doing, every step.

Okay, thank you for the example.

I have run both tools on the whole folder, which gave me a billion empty folders as output.
I get two different errors (as seen in attachment), EndOfStreamException and ArgumentOutOfRangeException on different files, but curiously, the same files get the same error with the different scripts (I would show both outputs, but I can only add one atttachment).

I don't know what is going on, I MUST have done something wrong in the configuration of the files before using the tool, I just dont know what...

When a person gets the game files for which a specific tool has been made, in this case The Order 1886, once you get the game files and begin the process, the steps become clear as daylight, i cant possibly think of a reason as to why its difficult to follow them, on top of that, it is spoken in abbreviations?

While I do not agree completely with ap127's approach, I do take umbridge with your claim that the instructions are "clear as daylight", owing to the fact that I still have not managed to extract a single mesh.
I do not claim to be the most knowledgeable member on this site, and while the games I have ripped models from do not number in the dozens, this is far from the first game I have attempted to unpack, but it is by far the most difficult.

If the steps are indeed "clear as daylight" to you, would you be willing to maybe take a look at my situation over discord, and see if you can figure out what I am doing wrong?
I'll even toss you something over PayPal if you can get me rolling, because I have wanted these models forever, but for the life of me I just cannot get this to work...

In this game, each asset is split in 2 parts: CPU part and GPU part. They are placed in separate folders, but named the same.

For the tool to work, it doesnt matter where the files are, thats why its not specified. In other words, you can place the files anywhere you want, and then use the tool on them. The only thing needed is to rename "gpu" files, because you can't have 2 files with the same name in the same folder. Its all explaned above.

This message actually helped with my issue.
I don't wanna get into what I was doing wrong, it was a dumb mistake but I am doing my best...

I seem to have the tool working correctly now and exporting textures and models, even streams.
However, I seem to be running into the same issue that fullinu had back on page two.

What version of Blender I need for script? Does not seems to work, complaining about 
Python: Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "C:\Users\X\AppData\Roaming\Blender Foundation\Blender\2.91\scripts\addons\secascii_1886.py", line 427, in execute
    readASCII280(context, binfile, collect, fileName, self)
  File "C:\Users\X\AppData\Roaming\Blender Foundation\Blender\2.91\scripts\addons\secascii_1886.py", line 149, in readASCII280
    locate  = [float(coords[0])/scale, float(coords[1])/scale, float(coords[2])/scale]
NameError: name 'scale' is not defined

I downloaded Blender 2.80 (64bit), same error
Most models give me errors similar to this, while the ones that do load do not have textures.
Any idea on how to proceed?

If that would be a help, I could send a sampling of the models I get from the tool, just to see if they match what the tool exports on your end.
Then we'd know if this is a blender issue, or a I-have-somehow-configured-the-tool-incorrectly-once-again-issue...

That script is ONLY for quick loading maps.
Do NOT use it on anything else, it will not work.

I see this now. Sorry.

Hopefully last one; When I unpack the file 8aed163e8399a422 (or 8aed163e8399a422.raw) with the map tool, I get 101 files in the model folder, implying that there are more than 30 models contained in this file. The ones I have tested with blender give me an error, as complained [foolishly] about above, implying that these are skeletal meshes.
However, when I extract the same file with the skeleton tool, I get only four files - two models. Neither of the two, when inspected via neosis give me anything remarkable.

Is this correct behavior, or have I somehow configured the folders wrong [again]?

Edit: I do get a bunch of unknown texture type... Errors? (Screenshot attached)
Is this different on your end?
