Damn... good thing i haven't posted a topic like this...
But which .pck file does that one that you uploaded refers to?
I mean... what is the name of the .pck file that you uploaded inside that .zip?
Well, i wanted anyone who's good with this kind of stuff to extract " dngvehicles.sp " .
If i had the skills to do some hex code checking to it, or even make an extractor for it, then my life would be a complete success.
I tried 3DRipperDX on D:SF trying to rip Nissan GT-R. The results? Few textures are not accurate + colour change. And windows and headlight/taillight glass were not ripped also. This somehow sounds a bit annoying for me.
Hope aluigi can give us a little hand on both .pck and .sp to be extracted with a QuickBMS .bms script... But seriously. When i checked how the model looks like on ZModeler, somehow i recognized it looks so accurate for a mid-poly count model.
