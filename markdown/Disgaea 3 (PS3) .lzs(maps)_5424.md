You're correct in putting this in the 'Compressed files and methods' forum, but the contents of the file can be anything. The 'pac header' is just the extension of the decompressed file. Decompress the .lzs files with [this program](http://www.propl.nl/random/NISDecmp.zip), then unpack any resulting .pac file with the tool I provided in [your other topic](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=5422).

Thanks!

Decompressed .pac files contain specific data(.chr,.chr2,.hex,.obf files) and RAW textures.
