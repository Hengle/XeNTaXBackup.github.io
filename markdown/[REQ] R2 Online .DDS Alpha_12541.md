Hello there! I've managed to get .dds files from R2 Online, but after opening them in photoshop CC, I'm noticing that the alpha channels are just horrible with choppy edges. I'm wondering if I'm not importing them correctly or if that's just how they are! Here are some samples: [https://mega.co.nz/#!1kdVTCpI!UDn5FKLmN ...

Thanks for any help!

They are like that, with no antialiased edges.
