FABLE: The Lost Chapters - Tools

Edit: I don't have these tools anymore. Please don't PM me.
>> DEAD LINK, sorry  <<

Fable Explorer
Fable Explorer is a content editing tool that is used to change or add content in Fable:The Lost Chapters. Currently it supports viewing and editing BIG (.big) and BIN (.bin) archives and the creation of Fable Mod Packages (.fmp). The archives are used to store a variety of data and the Fable Mod Packages are a simple way of distributing modifcations. There are many different types of entries across all of the archives used and only some are supported for extended editing.

FableExplorer - ShadowNet Builds
Shadownet has searching and fmp merging built in, and the ability to right click a file and choose to back it up or restore from a backup. You can also compile fmp files with script.bin edits that work with any other program that loads fmp's (even a different FE or CBox).


FableHook
FableHook is a DirectX (and selected API) hook that alters the behavior
  of the game Fable: The Lost Chapters. FableHook allows you to force the
  game to render into window mode instead of forcing full screen.
FableHook comes with a GUI launcher that allows you to edit the config
  file with ease by altering the settings on the loader dialog. When you
  launch the game using the Launch button, or when you close the window,
  the configuration settings are saved automatically to the settings.ini
At thie time, FableHook simply renders the game into a window only.


ChocolateBox
Features:
* Find objects from BIN/BIG with regular expressions
* Improved BIN/BIG object creation process
* Improved object selection process

object copy, collision control, multiple selections, move, rotation, tng property control, etc.
