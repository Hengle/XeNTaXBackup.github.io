- Post Title: [PS3] Touch Shot: Love Application

Be back in a few days to work on models... have to go on a vacation . Very similar format to Onechanbara Z: Kagura. There aren't that many models since this is a dating sim; only 4 girls and various outfits, but I'll still work on it anyways. At least there's some 4,000+ images to look at. In meantime, lol at the backgrounds.

Instructions:
Same thing, extract CPKs, then place ripper in game directory and run....

lol
that's right doggie, kusai kusai kusai ha ha ha ha.


and more lol
i'd cry too if some dude said, "manko kusai!"

Includes model and UV map. No bones or weights yet; probably not going to either. The game is boring and the models kind of suck. But here they are if you want them. If there's enough interest I may work on it some more. Format is LWO; use blender to convert. EXE and Source code provided; look at ps3_touchshot.cpp for relevant code.

Instructions:
Extract CPK using aluigi's CPK script.
Place ripper.exe in game directory and run it; it will take several minutes to complete.
When done, since LW doesn't like DDS, use Irfanview to batch convert DDS to TGA.
Open a model file in LW.
LW will ask you "Where is 000.tga?" or something like that.
Point it to the right texture directory, select that file and texturing is automatic.
Then use blender to convert.
When converting, you will have to rename polygon groups (I use trigroup_000, trigroup_001, etc.) to something more meaningful (like face_000, face_001, etc.).
A lot of putting parts together and touch-up work is required (due to the fact that materials, textures, and polygon groups are not named) in your modeler to make the models look like the one below.
For example, when automatic texturing is applied to the faces, you will see black shit all over the face. That is the tear mask; you must delete those polygon groups to uncover the actual face.

Does not seem as hardcore as Queen's Blade, which stores nude models as the base.
This one seems to store at least underwear with the base bodies.

SIDE NOTE:
For those that are interested, Mahjong Dream Club also uses a format similar to Onechanbara Z Kagura and Touch Shot: Love Application. I cannot work on it however at this time, so if someone else wants to do it... be my guest. You may use my previous source code if you want, adapt it to python, whatever. The game's OK, but the girls aren't very pretty. Kind of thick ha ha ha... like 80's style anime. Like Touch Shot there aren't that many models but there are lots of costumes.

@LuchiaL go to BLJM60444\PS3_GAME\USRDIR\Install and find the la_data_file.cpk, extract it with quickbms and cpk scripts, and put the rippers from howfie into the folder to run it. And the models were not beautiful when you zoom in enough  [img]
