Hello,

no nifskope does not support this files ..

i know this thread is old, but i want to Import the Nif Files in 3DS Max.

I tried many plugins, but no plugin can import those nif files. Maybe someone knows a Plugin thats makes me able to do this?
Or a conversion to .obj will be fine too.

#edit: i found solution to open the nif files with plugin in blender and save them as 3ds

Hello

What about Dragomon Hunter? The file structure is similar, but somewhat different. Open with DOPKGUnpacker fails.
Dragomon Hunter -> steam://install/356330
