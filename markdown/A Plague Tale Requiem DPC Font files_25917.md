Hello can you please make a tool that will open Font files of this game.
The existing A Plague Tale: Innocence tools do not work.
Sample files are below.

Yo guys
I had a question or actually a request.
I wanted to say that if there is a way to edit font files in DPC format, can you guide me how to do it?
I mean to be able to extract the font file and add our own font to it and repack it.
And I mean for the game A PLAGUE TALE REQUIEM.

I tried to extract the dpc files of Requiem with the 'Innocent' tool, but it failed completely. Perhaps there is no list file that can recognize the dpc files of Requiem. I think it is currently impossible to extract the dpc files unless the Innocent tool is newly updated.

Yeah, I've tried a couple of tools but it doesn't work. 
For example, I have this tool but it didn't work.
