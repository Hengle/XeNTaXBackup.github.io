I know this is a late reply, but Bakemonogatari Portable does not use PSM for models. It uses AMO and AMB. PSM files are something else. You can find a plugin to rip AMO files here [viewtopic.php?t=10467](https://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?t=10467). AMB files cannot be ripped as far as I'm aware, unfortunately.
