Based on Discussion with Champollion on Discord, i have decided to open a thread dedicated to trying to open this game up!
so far we know .evo files are a compressed file format with an unknown compression method. using a BMS Script, the .DAT File Format used by Evolution Studios as sort of their standard format for the WRC Games was decompressed, which led to the .evo files.
there are also .VAP Files, with an unknown method of unpacking/decryption.
not really sure where to go from here.

From Champollion on discord:
"I've found quite a lot more including a linker map and the hashing function used for filenames"
