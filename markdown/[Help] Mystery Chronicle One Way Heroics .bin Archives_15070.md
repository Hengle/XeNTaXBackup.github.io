- Post Title: [Help] Mystery Chronicle: One Way Heroics ".bin" Archives

Hello, any chance someone could help me extract/repack(?) these ".bin." Every archive in the game is using it except Audio which I found out is using XACT very easily.

There are 33 of them and they range from as small as 4KB to 1GB, following the name format of "dataxxxx.bin" with an "archive.bin" sitting on top of it all. 
I also know 4 of these is just actually a video file with the wrong extension which play fine in MPC. The rest with my minimal knowledge I looked at with a hex editor and they all had bin in the header except archive.bin/videos, that's all I understand.



I attached some of the tiny ones as samples, hopefully they all follow the same format.

Thanks for any help!
