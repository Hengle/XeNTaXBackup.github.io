So a friend and myself have been looking into how to reverse the coding for Mike Davis' program Forza Studio. Well I know so much as to what my uncle has told me about the coding wise for the program but doesn't have the time on his hands at the moment. I was just wondering if someone on here could either explain it or reverse the code for us? He's told me that the functions are private voids, but they're taking two arguments/bits of information that you need to feed into it, then next screen calls that function around where newmenuitems() is, this just opened about 20 questions. When you Import a .carbin from an extracted Forza car file when you right click on the file it says Extract Checked and Extract All, we're looking to add an Import menu there also. If anyone could help it would be much appreciated

"reverse the coding"  

adding context menu items is very easy. how would you go about writing the actual importing feature?

Well whether it's reversing the code or not I don't know. It may be the fact that it needs to be edited for the "Import" feature to be added to the program. A friend spoke to Mike and he said he didn't have the time or have a modified console in order to test it. Now we have the consoles to test it out, just don't have the knowledge to change the way how the program has been written. We don't know how we're going to go about writing a script for the import feature but there must be a way. We're just looking for someone who can help us out as much as possible.
