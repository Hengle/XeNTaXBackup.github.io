Just out of curiosity, may I ask how you found that password, ekey? brute force, hex analysis, disassembling ?

The easiest way to find these is probably to look for strings in the .EXE (preferably near other strings like "ZIP", "Adler", etc.) and try them all. Another idea would be to use a fake unzip DLL (if it's external) or simply adding a breakpoint on the unzip function of the EXE when running it through a debugger...
