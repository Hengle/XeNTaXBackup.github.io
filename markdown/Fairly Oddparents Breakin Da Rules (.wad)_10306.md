Well, simply enough, I know these contain graphics, but I'm not sure how to extract them. Some can be viewed via tile viewers such as TiledGGD, proving that there are indeed graphics contained in them. I was hoping someone would be able to find a quick way to extract them.

Can't remember if these were the demo files or not, but considering the demo has the same first level as the full game I'm not sure which version these came from. Either way, I don't think it should matter much, as they have the same file system. It's the PC version by the way.
