- Post Title: Far Cry 3 Blood Dragon fonts

Does anyone know where I can find the font used for BD?

Far Cry 3 fonts were in common.dat -> graphics -> fonts AND ui -> common -> fonts -> fire
I've found the same 4 fonts in BD in common.dat -> graphics -> fonts, but they are not used in-game.
I've checked every .xbt file and only found a file named "7E0663C868F1B1CD.xbt" in common.dat, which is a font, but it looks like it isn't used either.
