You're right, the PAKs are normal Zip files, they just played around with the header.
I've modified the minizip/miniunzip from zlib to work with the modified Zips:

For the interested, the Zip magic bytes (i.e. PK\03\04) are simply XORed with 0xFFFFFFFF and this value is used as the magic in the file instead.
