So you seem quite new to the scene around here, that's cool. I think a large majority of this forum is well aware of 3D Ripper Dx for years now but quite frankly, I don't recommend using it unless it's a dire last resort. It only works on 32 bit applications, and unlike Ninja Ripper it absolutely does not capture or has the possibility of obtaining any t-pose models whatsoever.

3D Ripper DX allows you to rip models & whatnot from DirectX 9.0 applications (emulators included). Have yet to test it out myself, but apparently you'll need a really beefy pc.

One 'good' example: now is possible to rip models from PC MGS2, and make good HL2 mod based on it.

Games have been using Direct X 10,11 and I believe 12 for a good 5-8 years now, Direct X 9 games haven't been released for a loong time at this point.

It works with *some* emulators, but it has issues with emulators like PS1 and PS2, and even PS3 due to the way the emulators work, same issue with Xenia.

In terms of MGS2, we've had tools to rip models from MGS2 for a little over 10 years now, it's why I originally joined the forum, and more recently there have been a bunch of topics here on ripping models, textures and animations from MGS1, 2, 3 and 4.

3D Ripper is actually really good, I've used it for many things, but it does have a number of issues, its why it stopped being updated so long ago.
