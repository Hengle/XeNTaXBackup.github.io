- Post Title: Populous 3: The Beginning Custom Installer for Windows XP

I have created a custom installer for Populous 3: The Beginning (older bullfrog game).

Hope it's of use to anyone.

I have included download links to both the installer alone, and the re-authored .nrg for those who don't know how 

Old release notes:

```

Populous: The Beginning Windows XP Installer

Since EA and DICE fucked up their installer, it won't work on Windows XP. This Installer takes care of that, and installs the files to where they belong.

If you have any questions, you can visit nkcss.com.

Update History:

1.1, June 17th 2007:
* Fixed errors when large amounts of free space are available.
* Fixed status messages when the CD was not found and removed unneeded popup message.

1.0, February 27th 2006:
Initial Release.

```
