Does anyone know how to fix this quickbms error for this .pak file for extracting this Crash Team Racing Nitro Fueled 4gb file? I know a little about Hex Editor to try to fix it but I'm not a pro at it. (Also using Marvel Ultimate Alliance 2.bms script for extracting)

Error: Can't read 11 bytes from offset 000001003e8d4800.
       Anyway don't worry, it's possible that the BMS script has been written
       to exit in this way if it's reached the end of the archive so check it
       or contact its author or verify that all the files have been extracted.
       Please check the following coverage information to know if it's ok.

Last script line before the error or that produced the error:
