Check this files
In Unity Studio it load sound, textures, script, shader,...
But no tree list of objects
If you extract bundle with UABE then load .assets you will see a list of meshes there
This happen to almost new Unity games
They been protected or Unity Studio is "obsolete"?

not protected as far as i can tell, just newer. Unity Studio is not obsolete, 
just outdated, it is still the only Unity tool that can convert compressed meshes.
