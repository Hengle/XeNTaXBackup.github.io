- Post Title: Is it possible to extract the map/city from PS2 Spider-Man 2?

Hi, I have just played Spider-Man 2 on my PS2 and I would like to know if there is a way to extract the city from the game. I have seen on the forum that the models for example Spider-Man and MJ as others can be extracted but I don't know how to do it with the city.

Thank you very much for your attention
