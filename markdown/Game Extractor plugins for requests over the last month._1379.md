- Post Title: Game Extractor plugins for requests over the last month.

Hi guys,

I have finally gone through all your requests and analysed them all! I thought I would create a single thread to say that if you posted a Game Extractor format request here over the last month or so, then I have looked at it and hopefully added support for the game in the update I just released. Go to the Game Extractor website to see if I added the support - I think most of the ones that were requested and covered are...

- Some of KorNets requests
- Playboy: The Mansion
- Area 51
- WWII Tank Commander
- Hoyle Board Games 2005
- Hoyle Card Games 2005
- SCAR Squadra Corse Alfa Romeo
- Mortal Kombat Deceptions
- Plus some others I probably missed
- Plus another 50 or so games.

The update should work OK on the Basic and the Full version, provided that you have the latest version of Game Extractor (1.5) installed before applying the update. Version 1.5 is available on the website too if you don't have it already.

Thanks guys for your patience!

In Area 51 at opening DSF of the File nothing occurs (As though in archive there are no files)   ... Watto make support of expansion *.000 for Area 51

Great work at the WIKI as well! Keep in mind though, that less than 1% a month visit this site through Watto.org, as our stats show. The bulk of the request here will then either be general requests, or MultiEx Commander specific.

Also, Kornet's formats were MultiEx Commander specific, and have been implemented in MexCom. I will have to add this information to the WIKI, I noticed. In any event, any ZIP file will be supported by MexCom or Dragon Unpacker as well. 

Kornet deserves a lot of credit for figuring out which format goes where, and that should be pointed out to all.

Hmm yeah sorry, I was trying to avoid saying anything major like this but thought it easier then addressing each thread individually. I realise that only a small amount of the traffic is mine, and that the site it primarily for MexCom, thats why I typically try to refrain as much as possible from advertising my program over yours, or try to do both GE and Mex scripts for games. Sorry about this hey.

And definately thanks to KorNet for his help, that was tremendously benificial! 

For the game SCAR - yeah I don't think there were filenames in the archive - so it is probably opening correctly for you.

For the game Area 51, I could only get *.dfs archives to open, not *.000 archives. If you can send us some more *.dfs files from this game we can check the format and make adjustments if needed.

OK here is an updated plugin for the Area 51 *.dfs archives - Take note though that some of the archives don't actually have any files in them (which is unusual) but I fixed the bugs that were stopping some of the archives from working.

You should hopefully be able to use this plugin by unzipping the attachment into your plugins/ directory. If if doesn't work, it is probably conflicting with the old plugin - please let me know if this is the case and I will rush a Game Extractor update out quickly to overwrite the old plugin with the new one instead.

Good luck.
