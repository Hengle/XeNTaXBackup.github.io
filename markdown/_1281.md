Well, I guess you understand this is not something we can do in a day. Also, we do this in our free time. So be patient.

Hey, sorry for the delay in replying.

I had a look at the archives you attached in the first 4 posts, but was only able to write a plugin for one of the Starsky and Hutch archives. When i get home I will post it here for you - I was having firewall issues that prevented me from posting yesterday.

OK, as promised, here are some things for you. (Starsky and Hutch game - *.wad format)

First, the specs for this game format can be found on the wiki, as mentioned by Mr Mouse above.

Secondly, here is a MexCom script for the format (fully tested)

```
Get FNum Long 0 ;
GoTo 40 0 ;
Get DirOffset Long 0 ;
GoTo 52 0 ;
Get FNOffset Long 0 ;
GoTo 60 0 ;
Get FirstFO Long 0 ;
Math DirOffset += 20 ;
For n = 1 to FNum ;
GoTo DirOffset 0 ;
Get FO Long 0 ;
Math FO += FirstFO ;
Get FS Long 0 ;
Math DirOffset += 48 ;
GoTo FNOffset 0 ;
Get FNOffset String 0 ;
SavePos FN 0 ;
Log FN FO FS 0 0 ;
Next n ;


```


Thirdly, attached is a Game Extractor (Basic Version) plugin for this format, and also a MexCom compiled script too (in the next post). To use the Game Extractor plugin, unzip it to your "plugins/" directory. To use the MexCom script, unzip it and go to Tools --> Use Custom Script.
