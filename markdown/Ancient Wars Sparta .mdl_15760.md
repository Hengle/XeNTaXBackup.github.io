I apologize.
Someone could write a script for 3ds Max import / export of 3D models and animations from Ancient Wars: Sparta (Fate of Hellas, The Golden Horde, Sparta 2: Alexander the Great)?

P.S. Sorry for my English, I use a translator.

Here is an example of models and animations:

I don't write scripts, too, since it's easier for me to use hex2obj (view link in my sig):

Thank you, but we need a script to import and export 3D models to the skeleton back into the game.
Excuse me, can you tell me who to contact on this issue?

P.S. I need a script to create the possibility of modification for the game.

I added the Ancient Wars: Sparta .mdl loader module to the latest version of 3D Object Converter:

How to get the 3D Object Converter:
Please download the 3D Object Converter from [http://3doc.i3dconverter.com](http://3doc.i3dconverter.com) and install it or download and use the portable version.
After it use the Help/Check for updatesâ€¦ function to get the latest web update.


I am using the XNALara Binary .mesh export format as a 'gateway' to transfer the fully textured objects (with Bone information) to the 3D Studio Max.

You can download the Importer/Exporter script from this web page:
[http://www.tombraiderforums.com/showthread.php?t=181251](http://www.tombraiderforums.com/showthread.php?t=181251)


Procedure:
1. First time you must copy the "XnaLara Converter.ms" file into your installed 3D Studio Max Scripts folder.
2. Run your 3D Studio MAX

3. Open your file with 3D O.C.
4. Export the loaded object as XNALara Binary .mesh format.

5. Run your "XnaLara Converter.ms" script using the MAXScript/Run Script... menuitem.
6. Press the Import button on the XNALara Converter window.
7. Browse the converted .mesh file.

I thank you, but I need not only imports but also the possibility exports models back into the game.
