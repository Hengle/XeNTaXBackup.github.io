- Post Title: Notifications when reporting spam on this forum not working?

Hello. Sometimes I'm reporting some posts as a spam:

And I check to notify me when someone will take care of these issues, but it's not working.
I don't get any notifications. Could you fix this, please?

Hmm. There is an error there. However, the messages are dealt with though.
