I re-read all the forum topics on the games on this engine, I was able to unpack .HTXT, get readable with SniperElite3Text .... but after editing - the translation (the text in Cyrillic) at the time of build gives an error

I tested it here and made a mistake, but with the AVP 2010 tool, it worked, at least in the .HTTX file.

Ps. All credits from the tool are from Evin, maybe you can contact so he can support the other files.
