- Post Title: F1 2013 *.nfs (SFeN identifier)

Hi!

I seldomly ask for help but this time I have to. I'm trying to get a hold on the files from F1 2013, platforms Xbox 360 and PS3. All files are packed in NFS containers.
Is there already a script or an unpacker?
To take a look, here are 3MB from one of the archives: [http://www.putlocker.com/file/140256BDDC8F6BFB](http://www.putlocker.com/file/140256BDDC8F6BFB)

Thanks for your help!
