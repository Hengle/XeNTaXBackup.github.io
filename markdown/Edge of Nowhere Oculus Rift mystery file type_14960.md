- Post Title: Edge of Nowhere Oculus Rift mystery file type?

Hey everyone and anyone looking at this! Maybe someone can help me figure this one out...

Edge of Nowhere is a great looking survival horror on the Oculus, based on Lovecraft's "AT THE MOUNTAINS OF MADNESS" and it's been built using the Unreal engine (4 I think), which means I could possibly take a look at the files on the inside. The problem however is that when I try to access the files, they're packed into some kind of unknown file type. The core asset files are two 3gb and one 1.5gb files, but there are two others, much smaller that I'm assuming are in the same file format, which I've attached here. 

Anyone able to help?
