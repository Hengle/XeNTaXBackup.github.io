umodel doesn't support this game
Can anyone crack it so that it can be imported into MAX?

This can only unpack PNG, but UE4 files cannot be converted to FBX or OBJ using umodel

Then if Gildor didn't support it yet (did you made a request in his forum?), which I have big doubts hell do it in the end, since he doesn't like all these Asian games that keep messing with the format.

The model is so beautiful that Gildor is reluctant to update the game. Is there anyone who can help?

For old version it'd be simpler.

Hello, when will noesis be updated? I urgently need the help of noesis to open the scene model. Thank you.
