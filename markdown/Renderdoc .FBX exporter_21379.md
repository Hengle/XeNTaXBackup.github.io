This open source fork of Renderdoc makes into a much better version of 3D Ripper DX, this fork allows a selection of EIDs to be exported into a .FBX format.
Due to being forked off of a earlier version of Renderdoc, several applications will never work or crashes at a certain point with this program, it may be replaced when a extension version or a renderdoc 1x version is made.

The scene is distorted, is there a way to straighten it?

Hi, thank you for sharing this. 
I'm always interested in alternatives to 3D Ripper DX and Ninja Ripper, especially for the Linux environment. 
Have you seen anyone attempt to extract 3D meshes from Proton supported games with RenderDoc inside of Linux?

Why is the 3D model mirrored? Can this be changed?

You can change it by using the mirror function in 3d model editing software like 3ds max.

So this cannot be done in RenderDoc?

This is a really good exporter, a nice replacement to 3D Ripper DX, however, the models exported are deformed (perspective projection) Is there a way to fix it?

I'm curious how you got this to work, I wanted to see if it could be hacked into a more current version, would love to get to work for d3d12.
