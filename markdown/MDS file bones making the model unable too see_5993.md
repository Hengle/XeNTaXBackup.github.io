- Post Title: MDS file bones making the model unable too see

You may think, whats this?

Well, weird or not, this is a model from donald duck (KHBBS) and those big things are bones.
Animating it is made impossible. the bones cross eatchother you can't even see what bone is what



Does sombody have an idea how i can shrink the bones or make the view of the bones smaller?

Thanks.

Thanks for the help. but i didn't convert these myself.

I got these from Model Resource and Zerox ripped them.
He/She doesnt know how to shrink the bones either.

Try this: When you export, type -scale 250 in the advanced options box. You might also want to try adding -smoothnorm 0.001 after that as well.
