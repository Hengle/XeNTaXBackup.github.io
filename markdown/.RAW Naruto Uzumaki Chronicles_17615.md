I was lookin for mod this game awhile, so i decided to mod nuc1 .. i finded some interesting things like a file named CFC.FAT , with some text about models and audio... but i'm stucked with these .RAW Files , that the first folder its audios i think and the second graphics/models ... but i can't open these files, is there a way to open these .RAW Files ?
