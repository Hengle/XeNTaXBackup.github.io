- Post Title: .dat file?

Hi hi!  today I've planned to have some 3d model from Medabots Infinity on game cube! I've extracted all the contents and I have the supposed models....XD 

I have a folder name character...I go in and I see 3 folder : anm , evanim, mdl....

So when I go in mdl folder , I find 46 folder.... I think its the character and the robots 

and when I go in one folder : I've founded that :  

M00_F.dat     13 ko
M00_H.dat     22 ko
M00_L.dat     18 ko
M00_R.dat     18 ko

I really think its a robot but I've tried to open it with milkshape and noesis ( the newest ) they can't open it :O

What program should I use to open that? 

thanks in advance !
