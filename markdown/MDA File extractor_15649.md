- Post Title: MDA File extractor

Hey, a couple of people and myself are trying to play around with some Myth War II source files and most of the graphics are inside an MDA file container that can't be opened with anything I've tried such as MS Access 2010, 07, 03 etc. I can however open them in a hex editor and see a bunch of hex code in there with some headers on the right. One of the files started with "RAYS MEDIA FILE" header and googling that led me to this forum in a thread with someone doing the exact same thing I'm trying to to right now. He linked an extractor that seemed to work for him but opening it closes it immediately after starting.  

Does anyone have a clue where I could get a proper .mda file extractor to get the graphics/anis from them? Can't attach the file I'm talking about because of size restrictions but you can get a better idea by going over to the thread I'm talking about. [viewtopic.php?f=18&t=9598](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=18&t=9598) 

Edit: Nevermind, solved - I can get tga files out of the mda now.

Hello, Im doing a few research on mw2 now thats back online, did you find a way to edit the pics in PS and repack them into working MDA? Basicly a reverse of what the extractor does?
