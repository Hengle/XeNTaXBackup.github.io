AC games either use in-engine cutscene (which are timeline sequences, not video files so you can't really extract them, it's just keyframe animation; I think your best option is to simply record them) or Bink 2 video (files located under "videos" folder in the game directory) which you can convert to other formats using RAD Video Tools ( [http://radgametools.com/bnkdown.html](http://radgametools.com/bnkdown.html) ). I also noticed that Odyssey uses WEBM for cutscenes (also under "videos") instead of Bink 2 so you can use almost any video tool to convert them into other formats.
