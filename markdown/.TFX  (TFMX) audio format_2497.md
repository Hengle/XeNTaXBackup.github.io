- Post Title: .TFX  (TFMX) audio format

I am currently reverse engineering an old game called Tricky Quiky Games 2 released for the PC DOS platform back in 1995.

Here are the files that I can't currently play in any TFMX player...

Any hints would be gladly accepted...

These TFMX files seems to have valid TFMX headers.........currently
i have no idea whats wrong with them. both data and headers look legit,
maybe there is just one little little byte difference or something.
*still looking*

Yosh, thanks for looking into them, I can't seem to understand what is the problem.

What about the TITLED.TFX? Did that one work? What player did you use for it?

Unfortunately it doesn't work, I am really interested in figuring out why, I've been reading the source of the player, but I can't find anything... I might need to use a debugger.

I tried using various player, but they all seem to be based on the same source playing code (tfmxplay.exe, Winamp plugin, and Deliplayer).

I got the files working a few months (byte-ordering issues), just thought that some of you would like to know.
