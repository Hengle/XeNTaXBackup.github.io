- Post Title: FEAR 2 Weapon sounds

I've done way too much research before you ask and I've only found the FEAR 2 tools that don't seem to be updated anymore. I've found everything besides the weapon sounds and I'm about to pull my hair out asking where the crap it is in these god forsaken .arch01 files. I thought it would be in the ambiance or with the voice files but no. So if anyone knows or would be willing to help much appreciated and I know its an old game but its for my own modding purposes.

Edit - On a side note the files are in a .snd format.. most still work but some don't work in windows media or in general when extracting.

Edit again - Nevermind I suppose, unless someone finds em lemme know but for now I am recording the audio solely and just taking it apart to make the weapon sounds, single shot and reloads with audacity
