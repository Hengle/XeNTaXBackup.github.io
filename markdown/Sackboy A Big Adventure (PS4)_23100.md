Supports static & skeletal meshes, textures.

1. Unpack PAK files with provided UE4_pak.exe:
Drop PAK file onto UE4_pak.exe, it will be fully unpacked with directory structure.
Note that originally all PAK files are in gingerbread\content\paks\ folder, so most resources will go 2 folders up, starting from gingerbread folder.
