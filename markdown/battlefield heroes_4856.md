It would be helpful if you could upload a file that you think could contain models.

for uploading files, go to mediafire or sendspace, theyre both free. I also recommend that you archive the file and save is under *.rar or *.zip format.

cheers

I converted your models into Wavefront .obj file format.

vladozver,

I released the 3D Object Converter 4.425 update package now.
[http://web.t-online.hu/karpo](http://web.t-online.hu/karpo)

Please install the v4.40 or use the v4.40 portable version.
After that you must upgrade to the latest version (v4.425) using the Help/Check for updates... function.
