- Post Title: Resident Evil 4 Mobile .h2z File

Hello guys

Several times I'm trying to find a way to extract the .h2z files from the Resident Evil 4 Android Version, but I can not find anything.

can anybody help me?

Example of .h2z file:

I found the unpack but not the packer.
[https://github.com/ruslol/H2ZExtractor](https://github.com/ruslol/H2ZExtractor)

It worked fine with the .h2z files from Zeebo's version of Resident Evil 4 so I believe it should work fine on iOS and Android versions as well.


But the only files I managed to open and modify are the .wav and .mid sound files, the 3D models, textures and etc... they are in files that I don't recognize ( .mcas / .mcms / .mcts ) and I had no success opening them or modifying to try to create a mod with better graphics.

If you've had any luck opening these files let me know.
