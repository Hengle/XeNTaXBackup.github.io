- Post Title: How to View OPFT Files

There's this file type I've been meaning to pry open for some time now, but I have no clue how to open it. It's called OPFT for some reason. The format originated from this mobile game called Guntama which had been discontinued for quite some time now. Although it was simple enough for me to extract the files due to them being in the SD card, reading the format is another thing entirely. Could someone take a look and verify how this format can be opened or unpacked? I uploaded a sample right here: [https://www.mediafire.com/?h8k0m6xobaauxfm](https://www.mediafire.com/?h8k0m6xobaauxfm)

I initially tried to research what OPFT is, but the search engines haven't yielded any worthwhile results. I can only assume that it's a custom format made for the game which begs the question as to what program or software is capable of extracting or viewing the files within.
