- Post Title: [Uma Musume Pretty Derby] How to apply Facial AnimationClip

Hi.
Uma Musume is unencrypted, and while extraction is easy, applying facial animations to the model is difficult.
I can find the expression file from the character's ID, but AnimationClip does not work.
Is there any way to apply facial expression AnimationClip in Unity?
