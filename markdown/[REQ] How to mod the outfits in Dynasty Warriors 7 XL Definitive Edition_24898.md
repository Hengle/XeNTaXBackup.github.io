- Post Title: [REQ] How to mod the outfits in Dynasty Warriors 7 XL Definitive Edition?

By using Yretenai's The KOEI Swiss Army Knife, I have successfully learned how to use it to unpack DW7 XLDE's LINKDATA file, and I have obtained many .g1t/.g1m/.datatable/.bundle/.kvs (and so on) files. But when I use Raytwo's G1Tool to check these .g1t files, I did not find any Outfit textures. How can I find the Outfit textures of these characters? I have many Outfit mods in .dds and .png format that I can use, but I canâ€™t apply them to the game. 

Does anyone know how to solve it? Thanks very much!

(ps. my English is not very good.. sorry  )
