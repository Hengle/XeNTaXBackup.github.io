- Post Title: Shin Megami Tensei NINE .xpr files

Hello, been trying to extract SMT NINE graphics from the .xpr files.
Unfortunately I'm not having much luck to extract these graphics as NINETools doesn't cover xpr, only TEX and BIN.
Anyone know how to this extract this or any tools?
Here's a sample file.
