- Post Title: WWE Afterschock (Nokia N-Gage)

Hi, i´m planing to make some texture edits of WWE Aftershock for the N-Gage, but i don´t get into the texture files, they are called benoit.xng and benoit.xgt for example. do you know how i can extract the graphics out of it, so that i can retexture them in photoshop and then get them in the game as well? if you want, ican upload some of these files so that you can try around a bit...
