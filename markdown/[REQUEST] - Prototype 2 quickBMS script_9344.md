I get the same error for a few files. I think boot or cell .rcf had the same problem.

I don't know anything about QuickBMS, but I tried this and nothing happened.

```
- open script E:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Prototype 2\quickbms\atg_core_cement.bms
- set output folder E:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Prototype 2\art

  offset   filesize   filename
------------------------------
- SCRIPT's MESSAGE:
  sort elements, please wait
- 0 files found in 0 seconds

Press RETURN to quit
```

Luigi, does your bms support reimport function (for both Prototype1&Prototype2) ?

I've got a lot of .P3D files, including what I need: such files as "mus_filename.p3d", etc. How can I unpack it? Could you please write the script?

Thank you!!!

you just have to change the header in each radp, to delete the 10bytes or so before the actual "RADP" part, then they work fine. my friend "egor" on a different forum just found this out
