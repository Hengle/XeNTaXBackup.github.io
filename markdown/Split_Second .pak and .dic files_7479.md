- Post Title: Split\Second .pak and .dic files

Hi again!

I want to know how to rebuild\pack back the .pak files with the new modified files. 
Here are the links: [viewtopic.php?f=35&t=7449](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=35&t=7449)
Also, how to open .dic file or convert .dic to simple .txt. 

Thank you.
