Well, this is not exactly for me, because IÂ´m working in another project.

But, itÂ´s for the entire community that loves RyL 2.

Can you add support to decode/re-encode for the RyL2 file types: .MCF and .GSF ?

The fact is, someone at Ragezone forums developed a tool to decode/encode this type of files ( to edit/modify NPC/ITEM/MESSAGE TEXT files ). But, they donÂ´t want to share, for absolutely no reason.

Wow, if this can be done, it will be fantastic!

So, here we go! The file examples:

Are these files cut in any way? I only found out that there's a jpeg at offset four in the .gsf. Size for this file is stored in a long at offset 0.[/list]

They are not cut lol

ItÂ´s some type of compression in it.

As far as know, they are data files, some type of CSV files, with data info in it.

Look at this to help: itÂ´s an old tool to view, edit and re-encode the files, but itÂ´s bugged and not work with ALL the MCF and GSF files. We need a real tool to work with ALL files. I hope this help you:
