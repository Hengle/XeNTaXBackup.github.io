- Post Title: Prince of Persia Warrior Within models

Hey, 
I have POP Warrior Within, and I wanted to extract the models. I downloaded Turfster's awesome Persian Rug program, and extracted the data file containing the models. The problem is, I'm not sure how to use the built in model viewer. It would really help if I could see the models I was working with. Can anyone help me?
Thanks!

In the <Bin analyzer> if you open a BIN file, you can right-click on one of the contents and then select <View/Extract>,
but alas it usually reports somit like "something went wrong".

I got the 3D viewer to work for example with the file "ACT_SandGriffin_wow_ff030df8.bin".
- select the content item "33000DEE (256) - Game Object - ACT_SandGriffin.gao";
- right-click on the selected item and select <View/Extract> from the context menu;
- select the Tab <Display>, and there it is..

I had to click on the <Z+> button repeatedly to zoom out & get better view of the model.
