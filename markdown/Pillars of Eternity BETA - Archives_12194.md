This game is being built with the Unity engine v4, and while I hope the devs shift to Unity 5 in order to get better performance and lighting, I wonder if there are tools to open the asset archives.

They are either .assets files or extensionless files. any suggestion?

I have not used it but since it's using Unity - and if it's without any major modifications to the engine - the "Unity Asset Explorer" tool will probably work to at least open the packed files.

It didn't really work, unfortunately. Unity can be such a pain...
