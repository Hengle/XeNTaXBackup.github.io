You are a legend for this, thank you. Also, to people who might use this: some textures are in different .rpacks from the one you might get your model from so always search them all ^^.

i'm a huge noob to working with raw and unfamiliar game extracts, and i'm having a difficult time knowing how to work with outright .ascii files. how can i get these imported in blender? (i use 2.79 and 2.92)

Nice how do you view the models, I can't open them in bender as there is no .ascii import for it and the fbx converter won't recognise the models so how do you open them ?

It can be imported just fine with Xnalara/XPS import/export blender addon, for viewing models before blender use Xnalara/xps py script for Noesis.

It seems like nrm,opc,gra,ocl and rhg textures extracts broken, plus I'm not sure if game uses 256x256 specular map for some models, and especially 32x32 texture for allgator.

i dont have PC files to check, but almost sure they are the same as PS4. So they must be extracted all correct. You need a tool that supports dx10 formats to open them.

Hey daemon1, thanks a lot for the tool!

I'm currently trying to rip the audio from Dying Light 2. They archives are too big to send, but the sounds folder looks like this: 

I'm guessing the meta file works like an index, and has all the proper file names inside it

Do you think you will add sound support for your tool?

Thank you!

Edit: ok after some further testing, I noticed that the audio is RIFF wave, and there are a lot of file names in all 3 AESP files

i thought there was already a tool for Far Cry 5.

Models have been extracted so there must be one somewhere. 

Just wondering, is there any chance of a Far Cry 6 tool? Many thanks for all your hard work

You can tell me how to open the model in Blender or Max? (.ascii and .smd).
Thanks x2 ))

Hi! first, thank you for your amazing work.
And second, I have a question. I'm a beginner modeler and I'm looking for some slum references. I did all the process you mentioned with the .rpacks but I couldn't find the houses anywhere (I only found the DLC houses, which are outside Haran).
Could you tell me if there is any way to get them?

*An information, looking in the game files, I found .LIGHT files with names like: SLUMS, INTERIOR SLUMS
I have no idea what this format is, but could they be in it?

Thank you so much for your time

no material files? skins? .dmt .skn

thnx, btw. just tested it out, working great. thanks

asking about .dmt and .skn - that way we could further mod the base game (not just getting models to use outside)

Seeking a solution to the following issue: I have extracted Dying Light 1 to it's RPACK files. The included zlib.net.dll is in the folder. However when I place the file on the exe. as instructed, it crashes after a couple models, usually in alphabet 'A'. For example, meshes_orbis.rpack produces only ASCII and SMD file for ammo gauge and anim flag then program crashes. Not sure if an issue but I'm using Windows 8.1 If anyone has assistance to provide thank you.

Awesome work, yet i've got a small issue with it.

Everything is done right, files are exporting successfully from rpack files, however there appears to be a problem when im trying to open smd files in blender - there appears only a messed up skeleton, not even a mesh. Could be that im doing something wrong? Any ideas on how to fix the issue?
