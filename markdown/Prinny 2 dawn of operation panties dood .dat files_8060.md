- Post Title: "Prinny 2 dawn of operation panties dood" .dat files?

hello.

I opened .ISO of the game "Prinny 2 dawn of operation panties dood", but there's a file called STAGE.DAT ,it's possible to see what files are in the .dat file(with notepad++),but i don't know how to extract them.

Anyone can help me?Thanks.

(i can't upload the file here,because the file size is large.and it isn't a hentai game xP)
