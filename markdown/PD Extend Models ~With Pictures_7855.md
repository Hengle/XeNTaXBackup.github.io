I am stoopid because I haven't figured out how to rip textures.

Stuff Needed:
Metasequoia
Intrinsic Alchemy
3D Ripper DX
An *.ibg

First, you need to open up Intrinsic Alchemy: sgFinalizer.


Load the *.ibg file.



Then select "Externalize images" and "Externalize geometries" from the Optimizer Palette and click "Run optimization."



Open up 3D Ripper DX and make sure the program is Intrinsic Alchemy: Insight.


[[ I blocked out my name. X3 ]]

Load one of the *.ibg files that were extracted from the original *.ibg file.




Then, capture the frame and open the *.obj file up in Metasequoia.



I recommend these settings:



Find the object and delete the extra boxes around it.



And that's all I know how to do! I can't seem to rip the clothing for it, though. :/

If you have any questions, don't be afraid to ask!

does the following file, fst00_01_16f.igb, crash sgFinalizer for everyone else? i can't map out
igVertexBlendMatrixListAttr
igMatrixObject.

i need to know what the structure format is, like so:

```
 uint32 _cachedUnitID;
 uint32 _geometry;
 uint32 _morphVertexArrayList;
 uint32 _normalBlendingState;
 uint32 _normalizeNormals;
};

```


maybe someone with an older version of sgFinalizer can open it?
