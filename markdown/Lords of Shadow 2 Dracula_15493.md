- Post Title: Lords of Shadow 2 Dracula

Hi! So basically what I'm trying to do is extract Lords of Shadow 2's Dracula mesh and textures for use in 3ds max. I've found a script for importing the meshes with skeletons, but it requires a file that's not superficially present in the game's directory. It seems like most of the game's content is compressed into .packed files, so I was wondering if anyone here knew how to open such files, or already has access to the mesh and would be willing to share it. Thanks to anyone who takes the time to read this!
