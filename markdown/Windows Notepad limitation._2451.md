I have noticed that hex code copied to native winXP Notepad does not want to exceed some like 5000 plus/minus characters, cutting off the reminder of the file when larger. Any idea how this could be overcome or what other text editor can be used to play with hex code?  

Main purpose I use the text editor is that I can format code to create some visually recogniseable blocks of data which helps me sometimes greatly to discern and understand the meaning of the content.

eh, are you sure?  I know there was a limitation in 9x system, but Notepad for XP is only limited by memory.  I've loaded files that are over a gig in size with no cutoffs.

> but Notepad for XP is only limited by memory
That could be then. Wonder is it system memory or virtual one? And thanks Mr. Mosue for Notepad++ link.

it has to be virtual, notepad runs in userspace, which doesn't have access to system memory.

I am totally agreed with you. Notepad has the limitation. It is not suitable for you when you are typing any language syntax. Because it does not make differences between syntax. While you use notpad++, it is the best for use. It provide this type of features so we can use it effectively.
