- Post Title: Metal gear Solid 2 Substance PC mod, change player models...

Hello everyone,

 i'm openning this thread because as we know there is now quite a few Tools to get in this fantastic game (Solidus...) to get models, sounds... I have seen that some people made trainers for this game too (a long time ago).

 Here is my point, i would love to be able to have, or to made a kind of trainer or anything to be able to change what we want in the game, i mean, being able to change the player model with any other models from the game (or other models..why not    ), to change any weapon by an other one...For example, being able to play the game with Olga ninja cyborg with her HF blade, or with solidus with his great gun, or Ocelot with his revolver... and after, if we get further, completely mod this game as we want but that's another story  

So i don't have any skills to start, apart from knowing all the Tools made to get in this game, but i would love to start working on it with help. So if there are any talented and skilled guys or girls wanting to go further on the knowing of this game, please help me to get start.

Any help would be great, tutorial on how to make a basic trainer for metal gear...anything will be good to have a start and being able to understand how that game could be changed, and to learn of course.

If you feel like, don't hesitate  would be great to make revive this game.

To start here all the Tools made by the past by several talented and passionnated guys : [viewtopic.php?f=33&t=10156](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=33&t=10156)

An easy way, to change models would be to swap the .kmy files (3D models format of metal gear 2) using solidus and Unmass in theory, i will try to test that and let you know.
