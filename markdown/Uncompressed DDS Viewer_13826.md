- Post Title: Uncompressed DDS Viewer

I've seen some people like michalss use a uncompressed DDS viewer, but he won't share it cause its private.

I was wondering if there's some other tool which works similar? It's because BFBC2's textures are uncompressed DDS files afaik.


I'd really apreciate it

Hello comrade, 

there exist many ways to handle texture formats as "dds",

i let here a link that worked fine to me:

I simply use IrfanView to view the .dds files. Or did you meant some other kind of "handling"?

Thanks for taking the time to reply.

I know how to open normal .dds files, I use photoshop mainly for this or SageThumbs for thumbnails in windows.

But the thing I'm looking for is a tool that can open a file that's meant to be a DDS file but without a header.
Something like TextureFinder but easier to use and userfriendly.
