So I guess the OFFICIAL tool and SDK isn't enough?

Edit: Nevermind, I suppose some people may not have the SDK, since it's not totally free, but even the free tool really does all you need, I've never had a problem making a video file made with the official tool and it not working with any game.

I really doubt that there is such tool in the official SDK. This is a proxy library that extends features of original library. Also, this tool is made for any game, including those with closed source codes.

Hi, when you work with different software you may have a problem like Bink2w64.dll because of several reason for example because of error about of its absence. So to deal with this you could reinstall your software or you can install something like fix dll tool for example from here: [http://fix4dll.com/bink2w64_dll](http://fix4dll.com/bink2w64_dll) .Good Luck.
