If I'm not mistaken, milance941 created the skeleton for that model from scratch.  It was done well before I had done any work on the skeleton files in the game.

Like I mentioned in PM, the ARXS file exported by ARchive_neXt is a binary file that currently can only be opened by my ARX_Importer for 3DS Max.  And it still needs more work, because it doesn't import properly.

I could write-up the raw data formats for each game for you, and you could then write your own importer for Blender.  However, you would have to wait until I'm done with the next release of ARchive_neXt.  Currently that is where all my spare time is focused.
