- Post Title: FFXV Terrain Ripping

I started a project to piece together Galdin Quay in Unity and so far i've got the actual building, bridge, parking lot, and all props put together. But now i have been looking in the game files for days and can't seem to find the terrain files, i now need the actual ground like the beach shore and surrounding background, like the mountains, but i can't seem to find it. Can anyone point me in the right direction or tell me if the terrain can even be ripped?
