- Post Title: Binary Lua 4.0 Decompiling

Hello

In Cryengine 1 console games - Far Cry Instincts title (Xbox) and Far Cry Classic (X360\PS3) used specific compilated Lua script files. It is files have "LuaA" Header. 
No one of existing decompilators don't support them. 

In Far Cry Classic port most part of scripts don't have changes, only compiled, so maybe is possible to create a decompiler, having source files from PC version Far Cry game?

In [this attach](http://www.mediafire.com/download/3ay2wy7zhue5hb7/LuaA.7z) i included Scripts folders from Far Cry Classic PS3/X360, Far Cry PC and some samples from Far Cry Instincts.
