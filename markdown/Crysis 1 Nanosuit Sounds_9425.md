- Post Title: Crysis 1 Nanosuit Sounds

hey, I've never extracted files from a game but a project I'm working on requires the sounds from the first Crysis game. I only really need one 'sound' - when the NanoSuit says "Cloak Engaged" and the separate file that makes the electrical switch-on noise for the cloak.

I bought the game on Steam quite a while ago and have it installed, any ideas how I can get these?

or alternatively if someone already has a download to some Crysis Nanosuit soundpack it'd also be greatly appreciated!
