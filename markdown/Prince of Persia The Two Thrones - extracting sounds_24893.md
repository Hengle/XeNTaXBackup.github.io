- Post Title: Prince of Persia The Two Thrones - extracting sounds

Hello, i ve found this forum recently to find a solution to extract sound files from this game. I ve used the tools listed here and they worked, however there is one tiny issue.
It seems like the tools extract every sound in the game but the one i seek.
The ones who played this game know that when prince turns into his dark version and vice versa a certain soundtrack is playing during that action.
From all the files i managed to extract i cant find these two. Many some of you succeeded? Or have some sort of updated tools?
