Is there anything advanced in this topic? I unziped the DMC1 and DMC2 nbz with 7zip, where I got a lot of mdl files and emd files. I tried to convert the DMC2 mdl files to smd using the crowbar, but I couldn't convert the mdl file of dmc2... I think the mdl files contains meshes of dmc2, but there is no way to import this file to Noesis or Blender. I would be really grateful if someone could create a script or other way to open the mdl file of the dmc2 on the blender. 

Models of DMC1 seem to be stored in emd extensions. However, there is no way to extract model files from the emd files. I hope someone will find out how to extract textures and mesh files from the emd files.

It's been years since dmc1 and dmc2 was released but I still feel a great pity that we don't have a proper way to convert these old models. Already someone has uploaded a sample of all nbz files. The nbz files can be uncompressed using 7-zip. I want experts to be more interested in extracting model files of dmc1 and dmc2. This game is definitely old, but there are many great models. I hope we can use these great resources instead of wasting them.

Hello, Acewell. Sorry to ask you a sudden question. I am currently trying to extract model files for dmc2. I succeeded in decompressing mom files using a pipework quickbms script. The problem is, I couldn't find a way to convert mom or sdb, tm2 files to a format available in Blender or 3d max... I know mom file is extension used in apple X code but I don't know the proper way to deal with xcode...

That's why I'm looking for scripts or methods to convert mom to extension available in the 3d modeling tool. I have uploaded the sample file. I've been looking for ways myself but I haven't found any valid means. I extracted sdb files from mdl files by using a pipe quickbms script. I know sdb file as one that contains the mesh file but I didn't know for sure what kind of tool this extension was used for. TM2 extension is texture file. 

If you are interested, could I get your help?
