Hey XeNTaX,

The GC and Xbox(1) versions of Enter the Matrix (2003) use a special version of the DivX codec to store their live action cutscenes. (The PC version uses regular DivX 5 and the PS2 version uses its native MPEG2 format).

This special version was made by Factor 5.

Now what's interesting is that the Xbox version is the only one that stored the videos in higher bitrate "HD" resolution (likely 720p) compared to the other versions of the game.

So I'd like to be able to play/convert those files. But as far as I know nobody has worked on reversing this format.

Here is one such file (it's Atari's logo) provided as a sample: [Logo](http://www46.zippyshare.com/v/56797542/file.html)

And here is the beginning of the file in hex:



Perhaps it would help to note that at the time that Factor 5 released the DivX for GC and Xbox SDKs, the "PC" version of the codec was DivX 5. So I would expect that this special version of DivX is based on DivX 5.

And here are some additional info of a similar version used in some other game: [http://forum.videohelp.com/threads/240342-Divx-puzzler](http://forum.videohelp.com/threads/240342-Divx-puzzler)
