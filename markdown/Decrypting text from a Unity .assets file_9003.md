- Post Title: Decrypting text from a Unity .assets file

I've never worked with Unity myself so I have no idea if something like this is actually saved in encrypted text, but regardless, the information I'm looking for must be saved in one way or another of course, so in case it's not encrypted text like I think, I suppose my description would give enough information on what I'm really looking for.

Being a fan of any kind of cardgame (regular cards, Japanese Hanafuda cards, Magic the Gathering, etc...), a game I also play is the Pokemon Trading Card Game Online. Since not so long ago, the game has converted to Unity. What I want to do now, is knowing what decks the AI is using. In other words, extracting the decklists from its file in plain English.

I've done my research in what file it must be (a .assets file: resources.assets), but it seems to be encrypted as was expected (not all text in that file is encrypted, but the non-encrypted text is generally only deck descriptions from decks you can use yourself, and such. Useless to me), or whatever's the case with it. Perhaps I can be helped already by someone's general Unity knowledge without anyone having to have the file, but in case not:

According to the rules, I can't link to the file since it's copyright, but must rather show where to legally get it: the game can be downloaded for free from [www.pokemontcg.com](http://www.pokemontcg.com) (after having created an account, you need the "PLAY Trainer Challenge" button on the mainpage), and after installation, the resources.assets file is in the installation folder -> Pokemon Trading Card Game Online_Data .

Hopefully someone can help me out here. Any help is greatly appreciated!
