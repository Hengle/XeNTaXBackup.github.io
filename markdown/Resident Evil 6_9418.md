Hi everyone.

Here are all "Normal Player" models Iv'e extracted from Xbox 360 version of Resident Evil 6. I hope you enjoy using them.
Extraction tools will be available as soon as completed with full bone support. Be patient my friends and please do not ask for extra customes because it's your job to beat the game and find out what the extra customes are  .


Final List of Released Models


With best wishes  .

I don't know why the tool couldn't extract the textures for me!!!!
The thread you mentioned, is about extracting ARC files not models. I created this thread to cooperate with the other interested guys inorder to extract the models and textures NOT just extrating ARC files.
Any way thanks for your attention.
Anyone knows anything about extracting UVs? I extracted them but they looked streched and weird!!!! Any one knows how I can correct them????

After I extracted the UVs, I checked them and they looked streched and deformed specially in top and left corners???? Below is the UV of leon's face that I've extracted from uPl00HeadLeonUsa.arc. 
Based on the shape of deformations, I think they must have used another mapping system like cylindrical OR spherical instead of planner UV!!! if so, should I convert them back to planner?? What do you think???

Refan - You have 2 ways
1. Remake a new UV map
2. Sometimes it's with models that UV map is completely crashed, but after adding main texture is good. Check it.

Thanks for your response but no. I think something is wrong with reading the UVs from .mod file. I'm sure that master CHRROX can help me. So, where are you anyway chrrox???

This topic is more to boast yourself that you extract models from RE6? Because it's not set how to do that. And you suddenly ask for help when no one knows how to extract the model?

Take a look at some artistic errors I found in RE6.

1- Strange deformation of leon's thumb  



2- Awfull quality of explosions compared to RE5



If anyone likes to help improve the game, please try to report these errors to developement team.

Thanks.

What!!! "Boast yourself"!!! why would I need to do that??? are u Or other guys supposed to pay me???? Please don't open your mouth and say something before even thinking about it a bit.
I created this thread to show the others that I'm working on extracting the models from game. If anyone has ever worked OR is working on it and is interested to cooperate, can easily inform the others and we can talk about it. NOT FOR BOASTING MYSELF ABSOLUTLY FOR NOTHING BABY.
I recommend you to take a look at the other model extraction threads and see how the topic goes on there. And if you want some info about my work you can simply ask and then I can guide you AND remember that I'll never post my code online untill the PC version is released.
if you want to start extracting the models, start it by yourself and you can also ask me or the others for some help.

Finally, I could extract the models with normals but without full bones. That's I'm working on for now to find a way to extract the bones from multiple vertex definitions!!! 

But one problem still remains : extracting textures. Anyone knows something about extracting original .dds textures from packed .tex files??? 
If anyone can help me, soon I'll post my first program AND if you want, can upload some models.

Thanks man. I have already used your tools but don't know why they refuse to convert textures to tga. My goal is to extract the _BM textures of characters and weapons. I used your command line tool BUT it didn't work. What is this script u used in your bat file : "rctool -x -re6 -texRE6 %1 %2 %3" !!!!
I used this but it didn't do anything. so I replaced it with "FOR %%1 in (*.arc) DO arctool -x -re6 -texRE6 %%1" And it worked but didn't convert the textures to tga. remember that I used your tool for extracting character and weapon models.
I really appreciate if you help me.

You'll need to add "-tex" as argument for it to do texture conversion. I took it away from the bat files by default since it is experimental at the moment and doesn't work properly with some texture files.

I think that the main difference between RE6 and RE5 textures is in the headers. I checked and findout the header of RE6 .tex files are somehow different from that of RE5. So, if u examined the headers of RE6 .tex files, can u post the data structure of .tex headers????

Here's the info I got for the headers.

RE5 header:
4 bytes - magic
4 bytes - unknown1
4 bytes - unknown2
2 bytes - width
2 bytes - height
1 byte - tex type

Tex types:
0x52 = DXT1
0x54 = DXT5
0x7B = DXT5a
0x7C = CTX1
0x86 = ARGB

RE6 header:
4 bytes - magic
4 bytes - unknown
3 bytes - resolution
1 byte - mip count
2 bytes - unknown
1 byte - tex type

Tex types:
0x14 = DXT1
0x18 = DXT5
0x19 = DXT5a
0x1E = CTX1

Edit: Fixed a mistake and added some more info.

I've been able to use the tool from Sectus to get the textures. Can you share how you get the models? I've already seen Helena and Sherry extracted. I'd like to get the guys now.

To all the guys that have problems using sectus's arctool for extracting textures in .tga format : 

1- clear the contents of "re6-extract.bat" file completely OR create a .txt file and convert it to a bat file by typing .bat instead of .txt in file extension.  

2- Type this command line exactly in your bat file : 
FOR %%1 in (*.arc) DO arctool -x -re6 -tex -texRE6 %%1

Congratulations. you are done. have fun extracting your desired .tga textures my friends  .

Normals aren't supported by Sectus' tool yet. I would just create your own until the final tools are made after the game is released.

Finally our party list is completed and all 14 normal character models are in first post. You can use them as you wish but remember to give your friend a little credits for ripping the models  .

Soon, I'll finish the extraction tool with full bone support and will share it with you my dear friends. Using my tool you'll be able to rip any model you want from Xbox 360 version of RE6. I'm also planning to upgrade my tool to support PC version as soon as it's released. just give me some more time and wish some more free time for me.

Edit : Sherry birkin is now ready for sailing as requested by a friend. Enjoy it.

See you around  .

Gonna be quite a challenge considering those are screenshots from the cgi movie Resident Evil Damnation.

I'm pretty sure the cutscenes from the game are videos and not in real time, at least the ones from PS3 look that way :-/

Those look like were recorded using the game engine to make it look more consistent.

assuming sherry and jake's change room scene is not pre-rendered, does this mean sherry's nude model is actually in game? how complete is it?

Hey guys, I was looking at the texture files for the PS3 version of the game and ran across one texture format I couldn't figure out. These textures are typically _VTF and MVTF textures and are of type 0x0E. They are 32 bits-per-pixel and I have tried all common 32-bit D3DFMT_ formats, such as R8G8B8A8, A8R8G8B8, A8Y8U8V8, A2R10G10B10, etc. etc. Anyone got a clue as to what type of map these are?

Thanks!

i even think i broke my new record too... it takes 1 hour to process all 3,000+ arc files and 20,000+ texture files LOL!

yes, PS3 only. pretty much done just gonna let some friends of mines beta test it and will release sometime early January (if no one else decides to release theirs). i know surveyor must have his own ripper for this as it's very close to the model format of RE5 . in fact, i went back and looked at his source code when I got stuck and was like ooooooohhhhhh.....

Hey guys, nice work !
Anyone figured out yet how to extract/unpack the SOUNDS ? I might have missed it somewhere, but if anyone knows a way, please respond. I've never met .sngw extension before. Here are a few samples. Yeah, and I also dropped in some .spc in there.

.SPC is a container for .XMA streams 

there is a tool that can extract them found here



It will spit out the xma's inside the .SPC as for the new .sngw pc format I'll look into it

The only sound format which is unknown is the .SPC .WAV files they turn out funky. If you wanna take a look at them check this thread:

Edit: And since you think you can gain money off shortening my download link into an ADFLY link you're wrong. I've taken the download link down and replaced it. Show a little respect to other people who actually put effort into making the tool.

Thanks in advance!

.SPC is a container for .XMA streams 

there is a tool that can extract them found here

link removed 

It will spit out the xma's inside the .SPC as for the new .sngw pc format I'll look into it

The only sound format which is unknown is the .SPC .WAV files they turn out funky. If you wanna take a look at them check this thread:

Edit: And since you think you can gain money off shortening my download link into an ADFLY link you're wrong. I've taken the download link down and replaced it. Show a little respect to other people who actually put effort into making the tool.

Oh sorry about that

What format are the models in?

I used the extract re6.bat to extract the .arc's

and then i used the re6conv to convert the .tex's to .dds

and now im stuck on how to get the models into blender/3dsmax. I looked at the pages and people just show their results, but no instructions.

Is there a way to get these models into blender/3dsmax?

i got the normal maps n diffuse maps... where's the models... -_-

I'm trying to get this nude ada wong mod for the game.

If only I could figure out the model formats.

So, I guess you guys ripped the models and there's no tools for extracting the models yet?

There is a 3ds max script made by maliwei777

[http://residentevilmodding.boards.net/t ... ort-script](http://residentevilmodding.boards.net/thread/660/3ds-model-import-export-script)

new v2.1 has more features, but original seems sometimes more accurate for skins.

But one problem still remains : extracting textures. Anyone knows something about extracting original .dds textures from packed .tex files??? 
If anyone can help me, soon I'll post my first program AND if you want, can upload some models.
http://www.tzarsectus.com/tools/ARCtool.rar - My tool can extract and convert most of the textures.
Any plans to update for RE7 (demo is out)
