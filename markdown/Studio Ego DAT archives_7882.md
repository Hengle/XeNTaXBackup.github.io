the format is a bit more complex and I need other files to know if I have covered it at 100%.
you can find the script here:

in short I need the header of the archives that have the folder's level different than 0

Here is another header with a lot of folders. If I'm following the script correctly it has LEVEL with value 1.
None of the archives have LEVEL > 1, so maybe that's how deep the folder structure goes?

It has extracted the larger archives fine and outputs them in nice directories as well (with a subdirectory here and there)

if I'm not in error the structure looks correct (lucky).
do you think the same?

There isn't any strange output so it should be good
