- Post Title: Resident Evil 3 Demo

Store Link: [https://store.steampowered.com/app/1173 ... City_Demo/](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1173690/Resident_Evil_3_Raccoon_City_Demo/)

The files can be found under Steam/SteamLibrary/steamapps/RE3DEMO. If I remember correctly, the demo still uses the RE Engine, and as such, we would probably only need to modify Steven's Gas Machine to be able to extract it.
