i ripped these files from the ios app

based on the file sizes against the android ver.... it seems to be bigger so i kind of assumed it's higher res

To extract Iron Man 3 .pak files you could use dragon unpacker [http://www.elberethzone.net/dup-news.html](http://www.elberethzone.net/dup-news.html)

I tried .pak files from android version of Iron Man 3, and they works perfectly. I guess .pak format from IOS version of the game is different then.

EDIT: From android version you can easy get meshes and import them in 3ds max for example.

Well, to import .bdae models you should write import script by yourself.

Models are 5000-7000 polygons, so they are low poly. Didn't check all of them, but I checked all main characters models.

meshes from the android version is pretty low... is someone able to crack the ios one would be great... from the looks from the ios one, looks pretty high res with normals on...

this is from another forum, they managed to port the android versions to obj with textures, abt 4k quad polygons very very low... no normal maps...
