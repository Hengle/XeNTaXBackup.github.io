Try flipping the UV's. Might help.

Maybe alphonse just happens to be a hunk of steel so it doesn't matter how the textures come out.
Did you try flipping UV's in both directions? (horizontally, vertically)

I might have done it wrong, so how do you flip the uv's in 3ds max?

You'd have to recreate the uvs yourself :/

You could always track down Kentilan and ask about it.

If you haven't tried messing with UVs yet, then maybe you should actually try the suggestion previously given to you and flip the UVs vertically and/or horizontally.
Go look up a tutorial on how if no one here tells you.

No, but I just noticed you had lied before when you had stated you had tried flipping the UVs.
What's the point in giving you help if you didn't want to take it?

I didn't lie, like I said I might have done it wrong can't you read? Why not try it yourself if that fixes it.

Those are the key words here. You haven't done anything or "tried messing" with the UVs, according to your post.
Unless you have, in which case you should make sure you clarify your posts with the edit feature.

What I meant was I haven't seen a flip uv option in 3ds max yet.. Or a uv tool/tab or anything that has the word uv

Want them.. O_o 
I already have them as you can see, what I meant there was try it for yourselves if it works since you didn't provide instructions to flip them, I might have tried flipping normals but that is what I'm confused of.. If was that the same as the uv's

Your uv and your texture are not matching, maybe you have extracted wrong texture or the bbrs script that you use is not working with your game data, all uv need to be reworked for match with texture, try to extract an other edward mesh or texture. Flip uv in 3dsmax (Modifier list ==> Unwrap UVW) don't make uv mesh and texture correct, even if you try to resize the uv map flip horyzontal or vertical.

I'll try that, but the other edward has correct textures except for his face which the eyebrows goes across his face, but other than that everything is okay  thanks for suggesting btw
