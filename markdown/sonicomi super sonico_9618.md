How did you unpack it?
The files were encrypted and I couldn't do anything.

i can get you an extractor and i have a noesis script but it crashes on some meshes because they have japanese in the names and noesis hates it.

I would greatly appreciate it if you could pass me chrrox 

I saw in DA a girl  extracts and coverted this model  I Upload 

search at several pages Japanese and they could convert to MQO but they don't post the script, and understanding that they have some problems with some meshes because they do is edit the mods of this game

Have you tried interpreting a set of bytes as Shift-JIS string? Works for me with non-ascii encodings.

Actually there is only a japanese an incomplete extractor tool, which is able to convert only the character models to mqo, with uv, but 
without normals and bones. textures are automaticlly extracted, even if i'm not sure it's extract all the textures...some of them seem missed. The beautiful stages of this game are not supported by extractor even if the format  seems the same, using the hex editor...maybe i missed something. this is an old render ( i remember i had to smooth it manually in max, cuz there was not normals)

I can't remember the name of the tool but if u are interested i should have somewhere on my hhdisk...maybe it can help to create a complete extractor. 

Ps: if u need some sample of the stages i have the game.

Ya I used that one before but the files were encrypted.
Maybe it came with a decrypter that I had to use afterwards...

I imagine the reason why the other extractor didn't work is because it hardcodes a lot of things.
It's a simple format, but if you're assuming things like vertex come first followed by normals etc, it'll fail on different types of models.

It's a very structured format where curly braces are used as delimiters to indicate chunks of data and a chunk tag describes what chunk follows.

```
   VRTX {
      <binary vertex data>
   }
   Face {
      <binary face data>
   }
   ...
}

```


I would expect there to be arbitrary chunks, but maybe they decided to store them in the same order (cause they write it out in that order)

They then decide to stick a bunch of ASCII material chunks in the format lol talk about indecisiveness...

EDIT: nvm, I don't know why the other extractor doesn't work. It's the same set of chunks looping for different meshes.

I suppose u are right. Thanks for explanation. So the extractor crashes mainly because the elements of the stage files that have to process and convert are too much. I didn't notice any difference in the structure file format between character files and stage files with the hex editor as u already said. I'm too lazy to extract the meshes manually, plus the uv coordinates ,etc lol ...I may use the "old" method using a 3d ripping tool directly on the game. It should work.
