- Post Title: Help with unpacking and packing Gunnar games .dat file

I want to unpack Hidden Mysteries: The Fateful Voyage - Titanic 's .dat files.
I have looked this thread 
[viewtopic.php?f=10&t=3423](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=3423)
But the file format is a bit different. Any one can make a unpacker and packer for it?
Attach file is a sample,and the Gunnar games's game list is here.
Thanks.

Here 's a QuickBMS script for the 'text.dat' file:

```
# script created by The Bacter
get FILES long
getdstring DUMMY 0x1C
for i = 0 < FILES
    getdstring NAME 0x100
    get OFFSET long
    get SIZEX long              # size aligned to 0x20 boundary
    get SIZE long
    getdstring DUMMY 0x14
    log NAME OFFSET SIZE
next i
```
