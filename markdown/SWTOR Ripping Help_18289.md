- Post Title: SWTOR Ripping Help?

I have been trying to figure this out for about two days now and I cannot seem to find where the models are for NPCs, I tired using Ninja Ripper on Jedipedia but to no avail.

If anyone can help me I would be forever than grateful for there help and will give proper credit when I make my mod!

Unique NPC like Arcann, Valkorion, Darth Malgus ect. are easy to find, as for other NPC's like Darth Marr, Thanaton and so on, I suggest you to use Jedipedia (there you could check which parts NPC is using) and then just find them by it's names, it's easy actually. 
Like this for example [https://swtor.jedipedia.net/en/npc/lord-scourge-2](https://swtor.jedipedia.net/en/npc/lord-scourge-2)
For chest it's using chest_capetight_bms_heavy_sw_a06 parts, just use windows "find" function in folrders where you extarcted files.

I tried that but all the 3d files are down. (I can't view them)
Also do you recommend NinjaRipper? or something else? NinjaRipper seems.... Disorganized.

I made a maxscript for this game long ago, and there are other tools here on xentax, you should do some searching.

Fair enough, but what about my model situation? Does that happen to you too? or is that a me problem? (All armors are down ((3d viewer)) but NPC ones are up.)

No, everything is okay. I ripped a lot of models from SWTOR, I'm a constant player there, actually:) You can check a vid of armor from the game [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYnvdfvwNa8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYnvdfvwNa8) And I made a LOT of them, just no making videos of them:) My point is, you can get everything with no problems and with bones+weights - not just static stuff!

So I need to go in-game not just the Jedipedia?

No lol  you need EasyMyp program, then extract archives and import models in 3ds max or using Noesis export to any 3d format and use Blender, Maya ect.

I have EasyMYP I just never can really find where armors or NPCs are in it.
I know it should be under SWTOR_Main_Art_Dynamic_*Bodypart*...Right?

Yes, they are there .gr2 files separated by body types bms, bmn, bfs, bfn and so on. I have no idea how you can't find them, with Jedipedia help you should be able to find everything you might need (and with some searching among files xD)

I hate to say it but I am pretty blind to this stuff....
I have a poorly decoded version of the hash or whatever. How would you be able to "Find them with the help of Jedipedia"....?
