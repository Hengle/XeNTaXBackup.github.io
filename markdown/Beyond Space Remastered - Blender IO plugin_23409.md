- Post Title: Beyond Space Remastered - Blender I/O plugin

I'm making a Star Wars TC mod for Beyond Space, in the vein of Rogue Squadron.
I'm looking for a coder who can write a plugin for Blender to import and export the ship models, so that I can replace them with Star Wars ships.
I received a cpp file from the game devs and they said that with that someone could code an import/export plugin for Blender...
Is anyone here interested in doing this?
