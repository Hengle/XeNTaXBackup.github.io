- Post Title: SpongeBob's Truth or Square Model Formats (Wii)

Hello, once again! I found a tool online that is called "HoExtractor", that can seems to have reading of this games *.ho files figured out. Anyway, looking at the asset types for models, they are split up into multiple assets as shown 

My question is, is if anyone can help me figure out how to read the models. The game uses the Havok engine for the models (I believe?) and the physics (physics I know for sure!) So, with this being said, I have included all of the asset files used to make up a model in this game to see if any of it makes sense! Thanks for helping me!
