Hello, i'm sorry to bump this thread again but i still need help converting these textures to a readable format like dds or tga. I can't access the link posted above to find any informations about that. 
-Actually i am working on an animation sequence with the characters from kuf game i  finished the rigging for two characters and started the animations. however after that, i need them textured so i can start the rendering. 
Sorry for the inconvenience, but I would be very grateful for any help concerning the converion of these textures types, so i can finally finish this project.
thank you very much.
