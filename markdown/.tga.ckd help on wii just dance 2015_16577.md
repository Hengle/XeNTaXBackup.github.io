So recently I extracted the files of the wii version of Just dance 2015, and I'm trying to extract these files. I tried with a hex editor, and I don't know what to delete. I heard they are .dds files, but I don't understand how. Any help? Here are some samples:

Is it hex editing? I saw that before, but omg I'm so confused.
