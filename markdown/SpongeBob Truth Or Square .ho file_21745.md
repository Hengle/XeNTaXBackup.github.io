- Post Title: SpongeBob Truth Or Square .ho file

Hello. I started a discord server about the research of this game not too long ago. Me and some friends were interested in the files of this game.
I have some samples from the Wii version of the game, so I'll send them here.

[https://drive.google.com/open?id=1wE4Fb ... 3RAK-EgEQN](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1wE4FbvsJXPDRrr890Eekr43RAK-EgEQN)

I put in one file of each folder, and more if they're any different.
Also, I know about the tool a member here hasn't released yet, I PMed them with no response yet.

The engine Heavy Iron used for this game is Havok.

Is it the same ending as WALL-E for the Xbox 360?

it is the same as WALL-E, however it may not be exact. WALL-E's .ho files are version 0.7 of the format, as found in the .lo files in the Wii version. UP (the game after WALL-E) uses version 0.8. still, would be nice for the .ho file in general to be cracked, no matter what version
