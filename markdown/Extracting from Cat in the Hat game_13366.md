- Post Title: Extracting from Cat in the Hat game?

I'm new to this forum, as you can probably tell by my post count, but also new to extracting models from games (aside from compiled source models, which are easy). I was a big fan of the Cat in the Hat game when I was a kid, and I found that on the PC version for it, the game seems to store the content in .igb files. On PS2, levels are in .wad, but if my memory of last night serves me, they can't be extracted to a usable form. My main hope is to get the models for some of the NPCs and maybe the player, but information on getting stuff from igb files is very little, Google yields few useful things. The game runs on Intrinsic Alchemy engine, if I'm correct.
