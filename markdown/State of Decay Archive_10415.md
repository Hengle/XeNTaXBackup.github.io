Hi all,

Can anyone have a look please on archives, it looks like normal ZIP, i can see files and so on, but it seems like different compression. I can send file on PM....?? It should be CryEngine3 but it seems a bit different..



Thx Mike

I don't have a XBOX to test and I don't understand much about this platform, but this would not be a problem of the tool you used to extract the XBLA file? This version is playable?
I used the tool Wxpirs to extract container and I managed to extract some PAK files normally using 7zip.

Well of course all is done but files not possible extract with 7zip, man im doing this for years this was my first test. Also CryEngine does not have any different format cross the platform, so it does not matter what platform it is, coz all will be same for sure.

You can extract the files from dialog.pak using 7zip, despite the extracted content be less than the compressed file, the audio file have been extracted correctly.

Yes dialog is possible to extract of course but this is not what i need. I need Fonts and texts and this are in file gamedata.pak

I have done a lot of test and if you pack it back with no compression as zip game works OK  So now any pak file is possible to repack  Currently im working on texts...

This topic looks like it is discussing files from warez. Leaked version of a game to come out in June. Stop that.
