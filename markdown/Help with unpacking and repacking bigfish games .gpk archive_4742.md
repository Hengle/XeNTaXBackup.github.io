I'm working on it! Here are some partial results: the contents of the channel.gpk file.
Could you tell some other game titles that use this .gpk format?

Here is the first step, the extractor for the Azada .GPK files.
I'll try with the other game titles you gave, and if it works, i will implement the "Replace" and the "Make .GPK" functions too.

O.K. Now I'm looking for just another (the fourth) type of gpk!
(Because I want to make a complete work, and I want my program to support all kind of gpk files)
If someone finds that missing type, my extractor will warn with this message:

GameType: #82
Unknown GPKfile!
Please contact the author!

Hi all,
I would also like to have the extractor, as I would like to save the soundtrack from Mystic Inn.

I managed to do this by dragging the gpk file for other titles (Fairies) over to VLC Media player and saved the tracks directly, but cannot do that for this specific game.

Thanks in advance.
