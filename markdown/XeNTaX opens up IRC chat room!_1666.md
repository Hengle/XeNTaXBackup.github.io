Yep, Rahly's been so very kind to host XeNTaX's IRC channel for all of us to use, so if you have a question, you may find one of us online there. 

Anything related to Game Resource Archive busting? Drop in! 
Just want a chat about coding? Hop aboard! 
Got kicked by your girlfriend and need a shoulder to cry on? Be welcomed! 

Seriously, go get an IRC client if you don't already have one (mIRC is good) and set the server to:

IP: 66.98.160.14 

Port(s) 6667 6668 6669  

SSL at 6697

channel #xentax


See you there!

Not that surprising; this thread is over 5 years old.

It no longer worked 3 years ago, as you've gathered. So, no. That server is long gone.

It's not over until the fat lady sings.

I guess I can suggest irc.esper.net irc domain server. [http://esper.net/pjirc/](http://esper.net/pjirc/) (free to log in to other servers) or [http://esper.net/publicirc.php/](http://esper.net/publicirc.php/) as possible clients. It's one of those public use irc servers. Could be useful unless there is something that supposedly clashed w/ the board (hopefully not). If things work out, I guess the irc channel can be #xentax.
