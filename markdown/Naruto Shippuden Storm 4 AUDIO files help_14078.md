- Post Title: Naruto Shippuden Storm 4 AUDIO files help

Hey fellas, how are you all doing? I've been lead here by a friend/contact from FFshrine and really liked what I saw, great community here it seems.  I've been a fan of naruto and anime and such for a while, and have looked into extracting the audio files from the game(s) I decided with little to no knowledge on what I am doing to give it a go. 

Firstly, I used Noesis and CriPakTools to get where I'm at now and it seems I've hit a bump in the road. 1st screenshot details me taking the "sound.cpk" from the game dir where it's installed. 

1)



Next, the second one is where I used 1-EXTRACT_ALL(no_decompression) to extract the files which gives me and leads you to screenshot 3. It created a data folder which shows all of the end result in the upcoming screenshots.

2)





3)



Screenshot 3 shows the result of the extraction and screenshot 4 in the JP folder shows a bunch of XFBIN and ACB files which is where I am stuck at. I am wondering if these files are the ones holding the voice files or other files that pertain to audio? Or am I completely going down the wrong trail in terms of extracting these files? If anyone would be interested in helping me or attempting to figure it out with me, it is greatly appreciated. Thank you for your time and for participating in my first thread.

4)



UPDATE!: So I lost everything on my pc due to destroying the partition and starting everything over but GOOD NEWS. I was tackling the same thing with Storm Revolution and finally got past this issue, I was able to convert the xfbin (only one at a time unfortunately) and make them .nub files using a tool I found on here from daemon1 called naru_nub".




I will continue working on it for all the community! Also Here are sample files thanks to MarioSonicU for pointing that out

I've been eye-balling this thread for a while hoping someone knew. I'd also like to know. Seems like some of them are sound packs, rather than just sound files. I'll do some looking around, and I''ll see if I can get anything new. I'll let you know!

It seems that the xfbin files don't have .nubs, but rather .nus3banks in them (like Smash Bros. for 3DS and Wii U)

Thanks for following, I know this would be a big release among the naruto community. I will look more into it. It's been a while since I was on the forums

Any new development about the character voice .xfbins? seriously, we need to find a way to extract .nus3banks from the .xfbins. I mean we were able to get the .nub files out of the xfbins from Storm 3 and Revolution, thanks to daemon1 (viewtopic.php?f=17&t=12842). I don't understand why it is hard to do the same with the nus3banks. I hope someone can crack it. Oh, and Korirny, make sure you are uploading a sample file for someone to look at it before making the thread. That, or you can ask daemon1 about the Storm 4 audio .xfbins.
