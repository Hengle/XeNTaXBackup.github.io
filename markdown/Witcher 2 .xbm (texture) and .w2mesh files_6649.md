Many thanks for the swift response and good news chrrox! It would be great if it were as simple as you say, although I have no experience with such things. I'll try searching around and see if I can make it work.

chrrox: graphic designers aren't coders, and visa versa  Some may be, but the creative and the logical world are usually pretty far apart. Best thing is to work together and not throw obscure language our way which we then have to spend hours trying to understand
