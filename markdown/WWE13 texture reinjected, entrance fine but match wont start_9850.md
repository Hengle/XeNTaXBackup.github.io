- Post Title: WWE13 texture reinjected, entrance fine but match wont start

I succeeded in reinjecting the texture file in Xpacker using Photoshop to generate the mip maps so I could have the same file size.
I did the test with Faarooq (putting a red X on his chest)

The game loaded just fine and he had the red X on his entrance. 
But after the entrances, when the match is supposed to start..... black out. Nothing. Just a pitch black screen.
Don't know if it is because of the mip maps setting. Maybe the game is trying to load them.....

Tich, Did it work with you?
