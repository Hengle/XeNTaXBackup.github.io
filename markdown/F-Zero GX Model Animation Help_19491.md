- Post Title: F-Zero GX Model Animation Help

Hey y'all, I've been extracting the models from F-Zero GX, and the higher resolution ones use a file to animate the limbs.

Here are the models, as you can see all mismatched - [https://i.imgur.com/GJ1pM0j.png](https://i.imgur.com/GJ1pM0j.png)

I'm certain one of these files controls the animations, but which is a mystery - [https://i.imgur.com/VQXTuHm.png](https://i.imgur.com/VQXTuHm.png)

It's gotta be an MTA, SKL or MAL, but I can't find much info on them. Would anyone know which programs might be used to run them through? The games share many similarities to Sonic Adventure and Monkey Ball, so I imagine any tools used there would likely cross over. Any advice is welcome.
