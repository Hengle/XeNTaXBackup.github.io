- Post Title: Help with .p3mmg file type?

Hi, I've been searching around trying to figure this out for awhile -- is there a way to open or convert .p3mmg files?

I'm trying to extract models from White Knight Chronicles and
I've read a few helpful topics here on Xentax that mention this file type, 
but I haven't had any luck trying to open it.

I was wondering if anyone knows anything.
Thank you
