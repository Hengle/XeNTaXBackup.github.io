- Post Title: The Incredibles *.scrp (translate it)

Hi, all the scrp files are encrypted. i don't know what it's translated in. so i have no idea what heavy iron studios programming language it is in. because i want to see what it means in english. i tried going onto another forum like ZenHax but that was useless and it wasted me over 6 hrs. so if someone can help me decrypt all the scrp files for this game or make something out of it. which i can decrypt or decode i'll be happy. please help me translate this scrp (script) file.
