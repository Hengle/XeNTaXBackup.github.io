yep, bro, that's a known problem.

(If you're familiar with blender you might try out blender nif tools.
Import, "NetImmerse Gamebryo files (nif, kf, kfm)"  
- good luck.)

dunno, what you mean but there's another way to show you what the problems are.
Try NifSkope 1.2.0 from July 2014. It loads the amalan.nif (skeleton).

But it can't attach any amalan kf (menu Spells/Animation/Attach .KF)

(Latter version might fail to load the skeleton for some unknown reason.)

(I had a look at the run.kf for extracting keyframes but it's a little bit confusing so far.
I could create a maxscript as soon as I get some keyframes but I guess I never will...  )
