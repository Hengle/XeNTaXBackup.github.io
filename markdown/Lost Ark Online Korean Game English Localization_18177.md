I was wondering would it be possible from a member here to change the game language from Korean to English? The game just finished it's closed beta testing in korea and will be releasing in a few months in korean. Being able to play the game in English would be very cool.

Here are the "Localization files" in the Locales folder in the cbt: [https://gyazo.com/2111f14ab8595fe855e7f6ded84ae3c8](https://gyazo.com/2111f14ab8595fe855e7f6ded84ae3c8)

And all of the different languages which seems to be packed in .PAK files and can not be opened in winrar or any other program: [https://gyazo.com/7fa263ad5ba49a6c451f7a95f0a29f51](https://gyazo.com/7fa263ad5ba49a6c451f7a95f0a29f51)

"en-GB and en-US" is the specific languages we need to add English to the game. 

If anyone needs the whole game folder with all other stuff not just the localization folder I can provide it. 

When the game releases adding English would be amazing and not playing the game in korean which is hard to understand
