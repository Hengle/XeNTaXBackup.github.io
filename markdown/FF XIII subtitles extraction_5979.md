- Post Title: FF XIII subtitles extraction

Using Quickbms I've managed to extract resources from Final Fantasy 13 (ps3 version) There are:  imgb, trb, xwb, wdb, grs, xgr, scd, wpd, xfv, ztr files. I want to translate this game but cant find where subtitles for cutscenes stored. Any help?

I'm sorry to ask but how did you manage to extract from the ps3 version?

I tried using the QuickBMS script from Alumi's that stated (*.ps3.bin) support but all i get is a "error in /srs/quickbms.c line 1424: myfopen" "error no such file or directory"

Then I tried making a copy of [target file] so that I had one named filelist_* and one named white_* but then it gave me the error ""error in /srs/quickbms.c line 9468: myalloc" "error not enough space"
And I know HDD space isn't the problem since the disk still have 1.5TB free.
This was with 64-bit version.
32-bit version gave me "error the requested amount of bytes to allocate is negative [huge negative number here]"

So please how did you do it? I read the entire [viewtopic.php?f=16&t=4069&hilit=texture ... &start=150](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=4069&hilit=texture+texture+ff13&start=150) but they only mentioned how easy it was to rip from the xbox version :p So I'm getting the xbox version now but I'm guessing PS3 have higher quality textures?

Bump. I'm assuming OP used this for the extraction: [http://aluigi.altervista.org/bms/ff13.bms](http://aluigi.altervista.org/bms/ff13.bms)

Anyone know how to do this for the Steam version, and/or which files contain Japanese subs?
