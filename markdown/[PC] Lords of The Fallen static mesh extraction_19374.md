- Post Title: [PC] Lords of The Fallen static mesh extraction

Hello all, I was just wanting to inquire if anyone here has happened to be able to extract the static meshes and textures from LoTF for an art project I am starting work on.
If anyone has, or has the scripts that can be able to accomplish this task please don't hesitate to reply.
