- Post Title: Shadow Vault .gfx textures

Hello guys.

I would like to open/view textures from Shadow Vault game.
After successfull unpack (decrypt) of data (see original topic here: [viewtopic.php?f=10&t=11039](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=11039))

I suppose there are 40 Bytes of header and then follow picture (texture) data with no compression.

Here are few files  which I think are in the same format: [https://mega.co.nz/#!cN5GGQCQ!vJYVPfbQc ... DrkfbyDEGE](https://mega.co.nz/#!cN5GGQCQ!vJYVPfbQcljVQwRl4u2cZgs3b32SP7BepDrkfbyDEGE)

As I promised in previous topic for each real clue the solver will be rewarded with full license to [http://www.graphical-installer.com](http://www.graphical-installer.com) (Graphical Installer) product (which I am author).
