- Post Title: ChromeHounds MDL4 and SMD4 Formats

Hey guys! I'm looking into the possibility of extracting some of the models(only really need the meshes, not textures etc as I don't intend to use their models) from the Xbox 360 game ChromeHounds which is one of my all time favourite game. Now I'm not trying to do this with malicious intent - I want to look at them for inspiration as I'd like to look into the possibility of creating a fan project in UE4. I'm not the greatest modeler and I want to stay true to the visual style it had back in the day.

I believe this to be justified as they closed the servers pretty early on, pretty much locking out more than half of the content that game had.

ChromeHounds has a bunch of archive files of the format BND - sleet01 and MrAdults were able to make a script that extract these in [this thread](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=4495).

I've tried the script and it works, so I have extracted 2 test folders;
[LG_ML900](https://drive.google.com/open?id=14Jm2r8Gq5_b69ZS3M74m5LgzmEuvuGz7) and [LG_TL062](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1S_aadENVuUJhTEjNlHS2NiuCzkD9azdB)

I'm not really into reverse engineering at all, especially not 3D models. I know how to look at things with a HEX Editor and convert bytes to strings, but that's about the extent of it.

So would any of you kind souls out there be able to take a look at these? Apparently the MDL doesn't seem to be related to 3D GameStudio and SMD4 not related to Source Engine? I've tried various MDL and SMD importers for 3ds Max but to no avail.

So if any of you kind souls could help me look into this - that would be greatly appreciated!

dunno, where the uvs to be found.

The mdl format contains bonenames and matrices probably (translations, rotations).
Should represent the skeleton.

Haha, thanks! Wasn't sure how well received this thread would be especially considering it was my first post. But I'm glad I got good response!

Interesting tool you have there, I've downloaded it and read through your tutorial and FAQ. Trying to reproduce the results you've got using your screenshot, but can't seem to do it. At the very best I can get 5 white dots I can rotate around 

One thing I noticed is that I can't seem to get the lower textbox under FVFsize to be disabled and locked at 0. And I can only get the mesh viewer to display if I change "noPtC". Any suggestions as to what I've messed up? 

Need to look into this a bit deeper, I'm not new to programming but reverse engineering to me is basically rocket science. Would love to be able to look at all the various mech parts for some proper nostalgia. Hell don't even care if they're not textured, haha.

supposed you're talking about LG_TL062_L01.smd?

the most senseless term I ever used on a button  Should display the mesh as connected points, 'PtCld' shows the points only (as a "cloud").

Oh derp, thought you had the regular one opened and not one of the LODs. That made it all work a whole lot better. Can't really make out what it's supposed to be.

Been following your tutorial and been having a go at one of the simpler ones available, pretty sure it's a weapon. But I'm having a rather hard time wrapping my head around how to find all these values in the hex editor, I think reverse engineering simply isn't for me  

Will try some more later.  

Edit:

Been havin' a go at it using [this file](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1t_DpUCbV0hnhvhEiBcncvZpMGezUua5C). And this is about as far/close as I can get;


Am I even remotely close at doing it the right way?

Sorry for the very late reply (too late, I guess) but I somehow forgot about this thread.

The years, they fade away. And some people search for models they will never find. Kinda destiny. "Some guys have all the luck, some guys have all the pain." Apart from this I had a quick look at the mdl version of LG_TL062 and found it  a little bit more detailed than the smd version:
