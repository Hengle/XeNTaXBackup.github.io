- Post Title: Starlink Battle for Atlas DDS textures

Hi there! So I've been trying to rip models from Starlink: Battle for Atlas. I used a BMS script designed for The Division (it's a Snowdrop engine game by Ubisoft), and it worked great for everything except the textures. They're supposedly DDS format, but neither Paint.net nor Noesis can open them. I'm not really a programmer, so I don't really know where to start, whether I need to use a hex editor or some other tool to get them working.

I've attached some the textures I'm hoping to get working as samples. Sadly can't quite provide all of them without doubleposting, as it goes over the file size limit by a few kb. Thanks for your time, and have a lovely day

Those files are not standard DDS files. They seems to be encrypted or compressed in some custom way.

Damn, that's a shame. I don't know the first thing about reverse engineering, so I suppose I'll wait patiently and hope someone wants to help. Thanks for your insight regardless.
