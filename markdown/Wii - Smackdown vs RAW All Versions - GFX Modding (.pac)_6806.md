- Post Title: Wii - Smackdown vs RAW All Versions - GFX Modding (*.pac)

Another inquiry, this time at the hands of graphics. I tried using X-Packer to open the Wii Wrestler files and every time I was greeted with "Invalid PAC File Chosen" even though the file in question is .pac. *.bik files (Bink and Smacker) are not an issue, given the easyness of the matter (RAD Game Tools). I need to know how to open these gfx files so I can inject custom graphics. Thanks in advance for the aid.
