Hi i have tried Towav.exe, it seems that the XMA format is different to what the one used in Resident Evil 5 was and i cannot find a working tool to convert the XMA files.

Just drag and drop the xma file and then it will spit out three xma files each with .pos files for looping with vgmstream.
decode the spited xma's with towav.

download the xma script 

split the .xma into the 3 files then drag them onto towav and it will give you 3 wav files

all i know is this, not sure how to put it together
