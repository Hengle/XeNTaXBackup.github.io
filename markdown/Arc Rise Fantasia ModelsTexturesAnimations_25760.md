- Post Title: Arc Rise Fantasia Models/Textures/Animations

I've been trying to understand how to get the models, textures, and animations from Arc Rise Fantasia and I've made no progress for hours. The point of this thread is for me to understand this. I've tried program after program for nothing. All I need is to get some models into Blender or BRRES viewer.

What is a model sample??Hahaha, good one. What's a model sample? That's a model asset which contains the vertices and faces (at least) of a 3D model as binary data.
There's should be a bres (or BRES) signature/texture string in those WII 3D samples (it's a WII game, isn't it?).

Usually the model files are packed in a (mostly compressed) archive, though.

I'm assuming most such models are contained in this game's btl_enemy.vld file. A quick check in the hex editor shows no such BRES entries though.

When I understood the format of the btl_enemy.vld file I knew writing a program to automate the process would be less vexing than sitting on the hex editor all day. So I came up with this tool instead! It is my first attempt at coding in C# too!
