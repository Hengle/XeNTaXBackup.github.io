- Post Title: "default.xbe" XBOX Showdown Legends of Wrestling PAL

Hey guys,

I'm in desperate need for original "default.xbe" file for the PAL version of Showdown Legends of Wrestling on the original XBOX. The file must not be modified and must come from an original copy of the game. I have tried fixing mine but i think i is corrupted. So please follow up my request by kindly giving me the "default.xbe" file located(i believe) in the root of the game disk. Once again i need this for a PAL copy of the game(i am not sure if the region maes a difference, but im pretty sure it does).

So to sum up, all i need is the "default.xbe" of the game located on the original copy of the game with out any modifications(Simply extracting it from the disk)

Thanks to anyone who will kindly offer any assistance!
