All right, sorry about that. From the context I thought you were sharing how to modify the font, which is something that should be shared publicly.

Hello Guys, I need some help with fonts, first time shadowlonely1989 and GHOST DEAD helped me, but unfortunately they have their own bussiness and doesn't have time to help me once more 
in the attached file are fonts and characters which I need to use. We almost completed translating 1 chapter and we need to test, but without fonts it can't be done, I hope someone will help me

Thank you for your effort guys!

Hi, guys, can you help me out? I need to make new fonts or edit these that I already use for Life is strange cuz the text in Max's diary can't show cuz it's too long. I'm using the russian fonts. I found some tools to extract from the font files but I have no idea how to edit them. I'll add all the files that i used below.
