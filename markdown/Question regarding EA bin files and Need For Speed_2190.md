- Post Title: Question regarding EA bin files and Need For Speed

Hi!

I see Need For Speed - Most Wanted and Underground 2 got support with its bin files.

Can I use Multiex to unpack the files, edit them, then repack, and play the game with the changed files?

Have anyone tested this and can either confirm working or not working?

Kind regards,
Dossy

The website states you can. You can unpack them. Then edit those files you wish to edit and then inject them in the archive. Just create a backup of the archive in question and then alter it. Should work.
