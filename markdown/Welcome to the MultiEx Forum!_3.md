Yes, well, it wouldn't be very handy to create two MultiEx Forums in different languages. The tool is used by people from all over the world. As English is still the no. 1 language in software in the Western world, it is better to have a MultiEx Commander forum that is in English. Remember that this is a support forum where users of the tool can come with any problem they have with the program or with anything they'd like to discuss regarding the program.    That's also why there's one forum only at the moment. If people come here regularly and have the same questions than other visitors, then we will of course create new subforums where these different issues of the tool can be discussed. Don't worry, there will be new forums if the need arises. But Mr.Doek, what would you suggest as additional forums then?   

Mr.Mouse/XeNTaX


PS: And there's also another forum here on XeNTaX, where I post. It's for the NWP members.   If I post there, my count HERE also goes up...

Als er veel interesse is worden er uiteraard nieuwe forums geopend. Dat is dus nu niet aan de orde. 

If there's a lot of interest, there's room for new forums. Right now that is not the case.

KOEL, Capt.Nixon, tof. 
 

Dit is trouwens wel het MultiEx forum eh, en niet het Games Forum, de voertaal is in dit MultiEx forumpje Engels, en de topics gaan hier eigenlijk alleen over MultiEx Commander.   

Het Games forum staat verder naar onderen

it says

Always wanted to extract sounds from your favourite game? Wanted to look at the nice graphics and use them on your own fansite?

MultiEx Commander is the tool to use to extract from and import into game archives. It already supports 143 games and the number is increasing bimonthly. Note that you can post anything you have to ask about MultiEx Commander at the XeNTaX MultiEx Commander Discussion Forum (click below!)

so you can extract things from games, and extract music from games, so some kind of recoring program

No, some kind of game archive file extraction / importation program actually.   To enable you to retrieve individual files from the archives and replace them by yours.

Yeah there seems to be a problem with daylight-savings time (zomertijd/wintertijd) on our server. I'll try to fix it.

Kun je eens de stappen van de rangen geven.

0-10 is N00B en +80 = veteran, kun je ze eens allemaal geven.

I won't say it in English
