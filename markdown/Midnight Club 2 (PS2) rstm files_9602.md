- Post Title: Midnight Club 2 (PS2) rstm files?

Extracted all the files using the script found here: [viewtopic.php?f=10&t=3758](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=3758)

However, the files don't play directly with vgmstream. Is there a script or method to getting these to work? I can make out some sound using GENH but it still sounds botched. Any help would be appreciated.
