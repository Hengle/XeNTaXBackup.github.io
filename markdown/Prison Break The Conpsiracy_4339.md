uhmmm I guess you needed to post in the Graphic section anyway all the files you uploaded are audio stuff (fsb/fev), meshes and shaders.
I don't see traces of graphics or fonts but this is not my field so I should be wrong

Shortly,
 Thanks aluigi, but about the first one you are probably right, but the second one in which is the text, i'm pretty sure that it contains some meaningful text context.

here the [brazilian forum](http://forum.gamevicio.com.br/i/topicos/72/72490-prison-break-the-conspiracy/index.html) where are some file infos and may be it would be usefull
 (if needed translate with google translation)

but even there they didn't complete the thread, they ask for help same russian guy.

Hey, guys... is there anyone who managed to translate the game? I know the game sux and everything, but me & my team have been tricked to translate it and now we cannot put the text back into the game. If someone has a repacker and is kind enough to share, I'll be really grateful!
