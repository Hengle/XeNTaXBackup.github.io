This is due to the old DOS multiex executable that runs the script for SDT. in a Windows (XP) environment it just runs very unstable. I am working on conversion of old scripts to the new ones. Then it will be extractable again and I can get rid of the old.

Okay, I have auto-converted all old script files to the new format. I must go through testing them prior release. I will take a look at the Populous 3 SDT format first.
