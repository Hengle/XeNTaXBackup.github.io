to what i inspected :
ggstudio found only half of the texture data (tim2) , thoses bin files are mainly room files and contain all data related to each room including models (search for MDL string with you hex editor )
also the bin file also have some bin file inside like re4 on pc have ...

anyway the mdl data seems to be only positioning data (global map data)

so the real mesh may be in another bin file i think or maybe it is in ^^
