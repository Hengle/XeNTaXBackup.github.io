- Post Title: Robert Ludlum's: The Bourne Conspiracy 2008 (Xbox 360)

Hello everyone! I'm having a little problem with the sounds files from the Xbox 360 version of Robert Ludlum's: The Bourne Conspiracy. The game runs on Unreal Engine 3, thus, the files are in .xxx format. After extracting them with Umodel, I obtain an entire library of .fsb files. After extracting one .fsb file I get a .xma file which I can't convert with towav.exe and so I'm stuck. I'll send a couple sounds for people to check.

P.S: As well as .fsb files there are .unk files and I have no clue how to extract something from them.
