Bigfiles in this game are .pak
Looks like nothing i seen before.
It's not zlib , crypted or home-compression : hard to guess.

If someone could have a look 

Attached : a small bigfile.

Look if there is a another file with the same filename, but with another extension (not .pak). If such is found, attach it!

PXR :
Nop, bigfiles are standalone, if you look for allocation table, they prolly
crypt or pack it too...

More info : developper is BURUT , in a previous game (called kreed)
they used .pak too, they were using zlib for this package.

But now, they dropped zlib for something else.

i send 2 other small bigfiles in case you want to compare,
other bigfiles are really too big for sending....
