Hiii all ,I am a huge fan of dragon ball and wish always extract the characters in this game under .obj formats
I am ready to make a payment via paypal $30 to anyone who would give me solution !!!!!   

I tried opening the DS game with Tahaxan but unfortunately there were only these types of files inside

* .dsa ( which i think is the character files )
* .dse
* .bin
* .dsf

I just want to know if there is any other way possible to extract the models either

a. using tahaxan 
b. using an extractor

thank you very much people of Xentax

The first post is almost identical to Chimera's   
[viewtopic.php?p=49950#p49950](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?p=49950#p49950)

but seriously, i don't think anyone can do much without some samples though.

Indeed, but the IP's of Chimera and this guy differ. Why do you use the same text as Chimera ??

hi, yes but nobody seems to take an interest in the post of chimera, and this topic was too old for the unearthed !!! 
I thought if I offered an amount of money that would motivate certain person if there was a possibility
