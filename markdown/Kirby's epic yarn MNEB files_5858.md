- Post Title: Kirby's epic yarn MNEB files?

These are apparently the in-game sprites of the characters, but how does one view them? Also included is a non-typical BRRES file.

The script for extracting them from the GFAs are Here: [viewtopic.php?f=10&t=5775](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=5775)

I would prefer them converted to BMPs or PNGS

I'd like these files as well.  I'm not sure how to run the script, otherwise I would have.

It's a quickbms script. Copy the code into a blank text document and rename the extension '.bms'. Then download QuickBMS (Do a google search for it), then execute quickbms and select the new script, then the file, and then it should run on it's own.
