- Post Title: Wreck-It Ralph GLOB files

Hey guys,

I've been trying to rip the audio from the Wii version of Wreck-It Ralph, but all the files end with a .GLOB extension. I figured surely that not all of the files were legit GLOB files and that GLOB was more of an archive. Turns out I was right! I found a BMS script from aluigi that extracts the contents from the GLOB files, but they're all unnamed DAT files.

I found someone online who managed to rip the music, filenames and all, in the TAK format. But he/she only included the music. Im trying to rip the SFX and VO as well.

Anyone know what to do with these GLOB or DAT files?
