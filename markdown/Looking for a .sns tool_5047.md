- Post Title: Looking for a .sns tool

Some of you may know about this .sns format, used by EA in Burnout Paradise and now FIFA 11 PC.

I could be able to import my own songs into FIFA 11 PC, but the actual songs (5) located in data4.big, are in .sns sound file format.

So i searched alot for some tool to be able to edit .sns files or even convert basic mp3, wav, ogg to .sns format, but no results.

Anyone has any ideea? thanks

EDIT: NVM!! I found my answer in the audio thread!!
