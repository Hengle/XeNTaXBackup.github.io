- Post Title: [Request] Mobile Suite Gundam 00 - Gundam Meister

I'm stuck with the data container of this PS2 game. Trying to rip some Gundams out of their hangar but no luck finding the way to extract the content of .PAC file (I guess the file that contain 3D models of Gundams is MS.PAC but I tried many ways but just can't extract it)

Anybody could point me to the right way? Any tool or Quick BMS script to unpack this .PAC file?

Thanks
