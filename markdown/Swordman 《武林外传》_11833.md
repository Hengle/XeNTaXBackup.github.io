...right I suppose it would be stupid for the company to make both games and use the same engine for both of them too.. I bet the file formats are incredibly different. I hope someone like "Zaramot" can save us

You should try this one: [viewtopic.php?f=16&t=11539](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=11539)
This engine used to call Element3D, which is developed by Perfect World(company) itself.
So the format used in almost all 3D game they develope!

Swordsman actually base on this engine as well, Just added a lot of advance shading stuff, so basically the material part changed!

> Okay, as Corey and Fatduck said formats are alsmot the same, this maxscript should work for you!well many thanks guys for try support, really I tested script and no load any model, so don't know what you upload Zaramot, I tested with files upload, and others I have unapcked and no load any, here the error, tested in Max 9 and Max 2010.

PS: and maybe you can add same thing as Swordsman, for remember last path where we load models or bones.

The script stop right there: getPos = ftell fstream + fixedLen

>> MAXScript FileIn Exception: -- No ""+"" function for undefined <<

Attach one model without textures here, have no idea why - but they works for me lol

P.S. BTW, how you're run my scripts? Maxscript-Run Script? If so, I suggest you to use folowing - MaxScript-Maxsccipt Editor - in editor's window File-Open (my script), then just use ctrl+e to run script! Don't close editor's window, you can run it so many times as you need

I use your method to load it and anyway won't load textures, weapons models only import a square Main Root called.

Sure I'm renaming files, my OS doesn't have support for Chinese/Japan languages and text, I tried to add unicode support for this script, like for SSO too. If it's not work that's bad, I thought the only game which doesn't have unicode support for now it's SwordsMan, there it's true I even don't try to do this lol. It's hard to implement unicode support, since for me it will not work anyway I think

Ah, Corey you're far more good and experienced with maxscript and reversing formats than me. You're the one who could finish it at all 100%
