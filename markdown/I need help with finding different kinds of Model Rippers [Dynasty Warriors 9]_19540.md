- Post Title: I need help with finding different kinds of Model Rippers [Dynasty Warriors 9]

I use to be able to Extract 3D Models from just using the NinjaRipper; but now it no longer works for me anymore. Someone previously had the issue of the Steam being Ripped instead of the actual game.

Turning off Internet = Unable to go on the game
Turning off Steam Overlay = Unable to use it at all.
On Other games = It works
Grabbed the Execution File to actually start the = It's the only Execution File in the Folder
I changed the buttons to make sure if it was a button issue = Same Result regardless
Used 64 and 86 bit to see a difference; used DX11 and DX9
Latest Ninja Ripper Version = Yes

Does anyone know the way to make it work again? (It use to work)

Well since your knew around here, guess what, there is a better/easier way.
You need the extraction tool from here: [http://xnalara.org/viewtopic.php?f=17&t ... 650#p81694](http://xnalara.org/viewtopic.php?f=17&t=1001&start=650#p81694)
Then you need conversion tool from here: [https://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php? ... 42#p140154](https://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=18042#p140154)
