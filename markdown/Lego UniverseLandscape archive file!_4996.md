- Post Title: Lego UniverseLandscape archive file!

I researched in the pk-files of LEgo Universe (LU) extractor is from another user in this topic: [viewtopic.php?f=10&t=4500](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=4500).
In the maps/1_live_maps directory i found some mysterious .raw files. With WATTOs Game extractor ifound some dds files but they arent the same size as the .raw file I looked inside with a hex-editor and found the dds-files, too. Andmany "gibberish" bytes which had a purpos. but i didnt found the purpose of them. 
And here  is the link:[http://www.speedyshare.com/files/241525 ... ardens.zip](http://www.speedyshare.com/files/24152562/avant_gardens.zip)
mAybe one of you find out something more.

Edit: I solved the problem with the compression!
In the new version the file is stored with the sd0 compression. I found some codein the patcher and worked a bit to use it manually.
Imade a topic in the compressed files and methods board.
Thanks
