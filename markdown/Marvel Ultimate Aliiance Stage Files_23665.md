- Post Title: Marvel Ultimate Aliiance Stage Files

Okay. so i just figured out how to extract MUA3 models and was wondering if there any way to extract the stage files.
There in all different formats.

.bbb
.cam
.decal
.g1pf
.grass
.pg1co
.pktf.zl
.river
.scene.zl
.ssu
.trmd

The files with .zl at the end can be extracts to .scene and .pktf but nothing i put it into will recognize these files so i was hoping the nice people on this forum could give me a hand in finding out how to import these files into say blender 

I'm sure the .scene is the model it self because when it is extracted from the .zl it become almost 18mb in size.

I will link a donwload for a example file.
