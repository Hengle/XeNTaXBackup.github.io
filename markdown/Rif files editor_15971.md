- Post Title: Rif files editor

Hello guys. We are a small team who are trying a game translation. There are mostly 4 kind of files inside .seek, .rif, .aif and some bin file. They problem is that we cannot find the text since we do not have any programmer in our team (the files seem encrypted). Any idea?
