Would anyone mind sharing the GTA 5 game files?  I'm trying to find the Ashley Butler model.

OK, found the PC game files, now need to find tools to extract the models.  I can get the ydd files with OpenIV, but the only thing I've found that imports ydd is ZModeler 3, which is subscription based.

Are there any tools/scripts for Noesis or Blender available?

So, nothing?  I don't have 3dsmax, so the importer for that won't work for me, and Zmodeler won't export anything useable (the collada export barely works).  I'm surprised no-one has tried to develop anything for either Blender or Noesis, especially given how popular GTA is, and how long it's been out.

Maybe one of the programming gurus here like daemon1 could take a crack at it?

Send me the files and her textures and I'll export them out from Max for you as whatever format you need.

A big thank you to Assasinge for tying, but unfortunately no luck.  It seems there's some mysterious issue with getting the skin weights/vertex groups and the skeleton data to properly export.  So far, the only success I've had is a Collada export from Zmodeler 3, which at least has a properly lined up skeleton, but only the head mesh has any vertex groups/skin weights.

So no one has any thoughts or ideas?
