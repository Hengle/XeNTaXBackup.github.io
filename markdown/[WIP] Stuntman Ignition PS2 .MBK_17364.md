- Post Title: [WIP] Stuntman: Ignition PS2 *.MBK

Good day guys! I'm here to ask for help with unpacking / parsing / figuring out some pesky proprietary sound bank from Stuntman 2 for PS2 (PS3 might also use similar or the same type of archive). There's possibility that headers for each contained stream are stored separately from audio files themselves somewhere in the beginning of bigfile (maybe it's between 0xf20 and 0x1cd8 in SFXMUSIC.MBK?). Anyway here're [the thread](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=17&t=4555) where I've gotten this idea from.
So here're samples from both [music MBK](https://www.sendspace.com/file/7c9vfv) file & [VOICE.MBK](https://www.sendspace.com/file/37p4pi). I hope these cuts from start and ending of both banks help you understand this archive type and probably devise any kind of proper method for extraction of BGMs, SFX & VO (however only the former is my main focus).
So long!

Edit:
[Some progress](http://zenhax.com/viewtopic.php?f=9&t=7021&p=30616#p30616) has been made but resulting BMS is still far from perfection. Anyone able to tweak it further? Thnx in advance!
Later!
