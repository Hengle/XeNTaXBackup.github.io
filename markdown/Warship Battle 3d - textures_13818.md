- Post Title: Warship Battle 3d - textures

Hi,  Warship Battle 3D stores its textures and meshes in .dat files.

The sim is developed using Marmalade. 

I can't extract from the dat file and was wondering if someone on the board could give it a go?

Here's a screenshot of the top of the texture.dat file.

Thanks, Dex
