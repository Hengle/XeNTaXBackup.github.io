If I had the exe and all dlls I could have a look at it.
It seems that the beta accounts are already given away?!

Can't start the exe. It tells me to reinstall the game.
With Google I can only find the news that an open beta will come, but no downloads.

Here's the decryption tool. It does both decryption and encryption. Just drop a file onto etd and it's automatically en-/decrypted to a new file with extension .mod
