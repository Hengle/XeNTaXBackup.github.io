- Post Title: Can anyone explain me how to use Gibbed Dunia 2?

I want to use it for Far Cry 5, I want some stuff from the game.
I tried to thinker with the programs a little, but the CMD opens for a split second and crashes.
I already searched around the forum for help, I tried this: [viewtopic.php?f=10&t=17888](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=17888), but it didn't help me.

Thanks y'all!

Please not do spam the forum. You could've replied directly in the linked post.

You need to run this in command prompt under the unpacker's directory (meaning it is not 'drag and drop' like previous tools)

```

    m_FATFile - Source of FAT file
    m_Directory - Destination directory

[Examples]
    FC5.Unpacker D:\FC5\data_final\pc\common.fat D:\Unpacked\common
```

If this doesn't work for you, nothing else will.

Do not reply. If you have more questions, redirect them to the original thread.
