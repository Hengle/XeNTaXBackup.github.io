Greetings.

Some time back I announced that I'm gonna make this here request. The request is for a tool that will be able to extract files from and re-inject them into the FOL format for both Blade & Sword games. The enclosed files are most likely the ones with ingame text, this will be used for a series of translation projects. To ensure the freedom for translator(s), it would be better to have a tool that would allow reinjection of files even when they are larger than originally, but if it isn't possible, a QuickBMS script is also welcome.

Here are the files in question (all below 2 MB):

[http://www.multiupload.com/MGZ3XVCNJI](http://www.multiupload.com/MGZ3XVCNJI) - Blade & Sword 1 English mb.fol
[http://www.multiupload.com/AR2DHRFYF2](http://www.multiupload.com/AR2DHRFYF2) - Blade & Sword 2 Russian mb.fol
[http://www.multiupload.com/PEJ7FHP3EP](http://www.multiupload.com/PEJ7FHP3EP) - Blade & Sword 2 Chinese mb.fol

Thanks in advance for any reply and assistance

It's a game rare enough to be sure to say that NOTHING is known of its formats.
