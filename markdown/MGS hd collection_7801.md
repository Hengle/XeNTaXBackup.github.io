PSARC-like, but use different compression. Has header(XBAR), filetable in the beggining of archive.
Files for research and testing can be accessed through PM.

You can use PSARC on the ps3 version, you can extract from MGS3 and get textures from the ctxr files, models are in the cmdl files and the format looks pretty easy.
