- Post Title: Diablo II Resurected

I was able to convert all the .texture files to .dds, but from what I read so far, is that Granny2 is the tool to use to inspect the models.
However I'm not getting any luck with that, so I added an example of the recently released Diablo II Resurected game.

Any help with this is much appreciated, thanks!

Hi TaylorMouse,

Jayn23's Noesis plugin still works on the model you submitted as it did for the D2R Alpha:
