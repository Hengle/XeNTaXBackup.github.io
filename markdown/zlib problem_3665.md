the problem is that zlib is not so good for compressing because even setting the max factor (9) its result will be ever not much optimized in terms of size.
for example the implementation of the zlib inflate adopted by 7-zip is a lot more optimized.

I found the same problem of the low results of zlib when I wrote my packzip tool and was really very very irritating.

IDK if this will help you, but I felt I had to try and help you, because thanks to you, I found out about the Offzip program.  Many thanks for that.  But anyway, download this tool:

[http://www.parkenet.com/apl/ZlibToolDemo.htm](http://www.parkenet.com/apl/ZlibToolDemo.htm)

You can set the compression level you want easily when recompressing a file.  Try setting it to the max, which is 9.  I have only had a few times that I could not compress a file smaller than the original one I was replacing.  If that still won't compress enough for you, there are some other tricks to try, especially if it is a DDS file.  I hope it works for you.   

Edit:  I went ahead and downloaded your files and was able to expand your compressed file, then I compressed it with the max compression and it compressed down to 1.86MB, which is a little bigger than your needed 1.85MB, if I get some extra time, I'll see if I can get that down for you.

I did not even notice there was a wav file in there, but taking off that much from the wav file prolly would do it.  Also, in the text part, if there are some letters that you can change, to be the same letters, or especially if you can remove any unneeded spaces, that would help compression.  Actually, any repetitive values in the whole file will help compression.  You have  very little to have to shrink it, you should easily be able to do it.  Good luck!

Thanks again for mentioning the Offzip program, it is exactly the type of program I have been dreaming about, and it even came with source code.  I love it.    

BTW, thanks to this program, I may be posting some pics of some hacks I might be doing on some Xbox 360 games.  Before I had this program, I didn't have the motivation to do everything by hand in a hex editor.  Funny that such a small little command-line program can make me be so happy.
