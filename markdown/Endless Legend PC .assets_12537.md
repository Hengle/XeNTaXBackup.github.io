It imports  skinned meshes with textures, with bind and pose skeleton from this game.
It requires Blender249 and Python26.
How to import:

2.run Blender249.blend
3.in Blender Left Text Window press alt+p and select 'resources.assets'
4.wait some time because this assets have more than 100 models, which are exported to 3dpack files in the same directory as blend file
5.in Blender Right Text Window press alt+p and select 3dpack files 
6.manual tranform and parent meshes and skeletons
