- Post Title: Naruto: The Broken Bond Ubisoft .BF Filetype Help (Xbox 360)

Can anyone make this: [viewtopic.php?f=10&t=7886](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=7886) work with Naruto: The Broken Bond? The header of the Xbox 360 .BF variant is 'BF64' and the bfextractor made for BGAE doesn't work with it. The game released in 2008 as opposed to BGAE which released in 2004, so the program doesn't work for Naruto, since that game uses a newer archive variant.
Trying to parse the .BF file through aluigi's tintin.bms results in this error: 
Example .BF file (BF64): [https://mega.nz/#!XCgU2QqC!C0fczJJzfCKA ... rJg6PnHLgs](https://mega.nz/#!XCgU2QqC!C0fczJJzfCKA9CaRLf_eymMujZrgFL5GFrJg6PnHLgs)
Thanks.
