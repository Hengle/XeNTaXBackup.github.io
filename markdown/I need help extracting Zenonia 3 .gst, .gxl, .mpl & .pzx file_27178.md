- Post Title: I need help extracting Zenonia 3 .gst, .gxl, .mpl & .pzx file

Hi, is there a tool that could extract the following file?

A little background, the game mostly have a .zt1 file but I used a script that extract it to .gxl, & .gst ([https://ya4r.net/forum/index.php?act=post&id=156606](https://ya4r.net/forum/index.php?act=post&id=156606))

Here is the sample file of the four: [https://mega.nz/file/M2FBUBRD#SFxwF_BSc ... _ga1Agg-yQ](https://mega.nz/file/M2FBUBRD#SFxwF_BScu44o6IQ6AlyqVZJ1LXXGo2qt_ga1Agg-yQ)
I included the raw zt1 file where the (Xls) .gxl and (Str) .gst came from

Here is the game full resource: [https://mega.nz/file/1vs2BIIA#twT9oY2Ms ... clHsxWjhrM](https://mega.nz/file/1vs2BIIA#twT9oY2Ms1FSiabvpP0_xs6EbUueMNN3FclHsxWjhrM)

Thank you
