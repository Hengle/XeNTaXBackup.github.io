Has anyone figured out anything on the 3D model files used in the Terminal Reality Infernal Engine?

 I wish. cause they made some of my favorite vehicles growing up for the game "RoadKill". I've studied the gamecube edition and if memory serves I found the main data storage but that's as far as I ever got.

You have it here first folks
[https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/131 ... %201.0.rar](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/13148857/RoadkillParser%201.0.rar)
The archives themselves can be opened with BloodRayne tools, since the engine is the same, but after that you are left with unknown files which cannot be opened with those
Cities and skinned characters are stored in different format, and I got bored at that point, but all cars, textures and interactieve objects in .TXD and .SMB format are mostly parsable, have fun, anyone, besides me I guess, any roadkill design enjoyers?

thanks so much for this. while the game could have been better I frankly always have fun with the game myself and love the vehicle designs most of all.

Anyone know if this works for any of the 3D models in Ghostbusters: The Video Game? (I would test it myself but I cant find my copy of the game right now so I cant test it)

Oh, sorry, not BloodRayne, but RavioliGameTools
I added city .bqs format to the converter, there are still some data I couldn't pinpoint the meaning of, but its barely important, full geometry and collisions are available

it has [came to my attention that there exists a roadkill demo](https://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=23810), and it has models that were removed in release, and those models are of different format that isn't immediately parsable
the demo disc in question where the roadkill beta was found:

the new updated parser that is able to convert those models:
