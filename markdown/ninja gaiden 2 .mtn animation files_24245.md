- Post Title: ninja gaiden 2 .mtn animation files

i know noesis supports the orignal ninja gaiden 2 for 360 a lot better than any of the other games/re releases, so this thread will be referring specifically to that version, that being said id be cool to hear if someone has found a way to view animations from any of the other ninja gaiden games.

main topic/ question has anyone figured out a method to view the mtn animation files for ninja gaiden 2? ive heard mtn is a popular format for animation files in games but i cant find anything that even previews the files. ive followed a couple leads to the DOA modding community but havent had any luck. 

thanks

figured id update this thread, even though i haven't seen much interest in the topic. 
I've decided to start work on making a plugin, or at least a method of viewing the animations on a model viewer. im not a newbie to programming in any way but its the first time ive attempted something like this.

i dont have much free time on my week, but i will be throwing in updates of any progress made every two weeks to this thread, hopefully any progress made on this thread is helpful to other users in the future

Gonna necro this thread, considering the progress made in Black and Sigma, not to mention tian's seldom-mentioned pull of RE/MC animations, but this 1 MB limit can kiss my ass.
