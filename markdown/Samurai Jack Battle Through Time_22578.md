I know the game just came out today, but anyone had any luck ripping the models yet? I myself haven't tried much, used umodel to try and see if it would work but I need an AES key. Not sure if that is the way or not. Any help of any kind would be appreciated! Thanks!

Note: Main game is behind a ".pak" file.
