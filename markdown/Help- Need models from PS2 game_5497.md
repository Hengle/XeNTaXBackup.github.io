- Post Title: Help- Need models from PS2 game

Hey everybody,
I am trying to pull the models from the PS2 game Shijyou Saikyou no Deshi Kenichi - Gekitou! Ragnarok Hachikengou. The file structure on the disk is fairly straightforward, and I have found what I think is the three folders containing the textures and models. The only problem is the files are in two formats I have never heard of before: .HD, .BD, and .TQ. Each folder, SEHD (.HD), SETQ (.TQ), and SEBD (.BD) contain two files per character: a (name)00 and (name)01. The only problem is I can't attach the files, so I will have to find another way to share them with you. If anyone can help me convert these files to something useable, preferrably .max, .3ds, .obj, .fbx, or .dae, That would be great. Thanks!

EDIT: I uploaded the entire model file structure to megaupload, zipped. Here is the link:

Thanks

Thanks for responding, even if you didn't help me. I understand people have jobs and such, but I have seen other similar posts get good answers within a day. Perhaps you could help me reverse engineer these models?
Thanks,

I did listen, but I already uploaded the files to megaupload, which is free to download from, and has better download bandwidth than the other two. If it helps, though, I will post on mediafire. By the way, Chroxx, The other post I made (which you deleted... TWICE) was even more important than this one, and didn't break any rules that I can see. Please let me replace it.
Thanks,
DarkScion

I dont care post them. These look like sound effect files and not models and textures there must be more files on the disc.

Have you looked at all of the files? It wouldn't make sense that they would have 3 different formats for the same type of file. I will look around the disc more though, and post the rest of the files.

EDIT: This might make it easier. I will list the entire contents of the game disc, and maybe we can pinpoint the model and texture files. Also, The game is textured through cell-shading. The DUMMY folder contains:
DUMMY0.DAT
DUMMY0_0.DAT
DUMMY0_1.DAT
DUMMY1.DAT

The MODULES Folder contains a large number of .IRX files, probably part of the game programming.


The SND folder contains the three folders I already uploaded.

The STR folder contains:

ED00.PSS
OP00.PSS
OP01.PSS
Thanks!

if you see some finny logo thing or a logo that says CRI, its a good bet it uses AFS. afs was a file system created to speedup the reading of data on the PS1, being it used CDs.. which read slow.

now a days its less common that you see AFS being used, but sometimes newer games still use them.. 


anyway heres an extractor

best just upload the whole AFS though, cause it look like your not too good at guessing the model files lol

Thanks Mario for responding.
I used the extractor you gave me, and it shows a grouping of "chr" named files in the DATA.AFS file. I don't really understand how to use this program very well though, so I will just upload the files. It will take a bit, as they are in total 333 mb and my upload speed is crap. 
Thanks for the help,
DarkScion

I was a bit curious so downloaded the ISO, and had a peek. the file names in the AFS are all stripped, OR the AFS is slightly different, so maybe all AFSexplorer can see is folder names ?? donno

but found an actual character file and it seemed encrypted. but I've seen this setup before in bloodyRoar4 and I believe king of fighters 2006 was the same. chrrox would know more about this, its a renderware game. 

the file is pretty standard to BR4 tho, you have a general container with names, stated clearly are DFF and TXD, common renderware formats. then the rest of the file is completely encrypted solid!

sorry I can't help beyond this, but least thats the low down on the game files. and anyone with more knowledge of the format would be able to help you.

keep in mind that the GTA forums have tools for dealing with earlier versions of DFF model files and TXD texture

Thanks for your help, Mario. Chroxx, do you have any idea what do do with these files? I willl google the file extension, and see if I can get a converter.
Thanks again,
DarkScion

EDIT: By the way, Mario, how did you get the model and texture files out of the AFS? I don't know how to do that with the program you gave me. I exported one of the chr files, and got a chr file that had no extension. What do I do next?
Thanks!

The files are compressed it is using the same compression as bloody roar 4. I have decompressed the files they are renderware dff models.
Here is a sample if you want to play around with trying different tools on the internet on it.

i managed to convert one model

Wow, Chrrox... you are awesome. The only things I need to know are:
(1) How you extract the texture/model files from the AFX file... the program Mario gave me is confusing, and only produces extension-less files.

(2) What program you used to convert the models/textures.

I can do the rest.
Thanks,
DarkScion

the file list is in the elf, I used AFSexplorer to inject a new name table, that way I could export them with unique names.

at which point it turns out that all the files in the AFS, not AFX.. are actually FPK files.. a common package format used by 8htings or whatever there called.

so just use the script that chrrox created before, and it works... lol

I don't understand what you mean... I can't even get useable files out of the AFS. I used Universal AFS File Extractor 3.05, and extracted the AFS... and got 198 extensionless files. Can someone please tell me what to do with these? I can't get anywhere until I get the texture and model files out of the DATA.AFS file. All I need is that, and the name of the program Chrrox used to convert them and put them into 3ds max.
Thanks

EDIT: What script? I see no link to a  script, and unless it were already in executable form, I wouldn't know what to do with it. I am new to reverse engineering. Modeling and 3d animation are what I know, not programming.

................  
Look, I know how to google, I'm not a noob. What I NEED, is how to get the models and textures OUT of the .AFS file. I have tried every extractor on the internet, and all I get is around 200 extension-less files, named file_01, file_02, etc. Chrrox, you were able to do this- otherwise, you couldn't have put up that awesome image of Berzerker, complete with textures. Can someone just tell me how to get the un-converted textures and models from the AFS file? I can find a converter from there. 
Thanks....

those files are fine extensionless, because there all the same format. toss them into hex, and you'll clearly see that.

its an fpack or FPK, google or search the forum for an unpacker

Uugghhh... (slams his head against a wall)
I got  FPK extractor, and tried to open them. They didn't show up. Do I have to rename them or something? Give them a file extension?

Sorry to be such a pain in the butt, but this is unlike any conversion I have done before. Chrrox.... how did you do it?
Could you just give me a small step by step tutorial on what you did to get that nice model in 3ds max?

I'm not new to all this odd-file-format-coverting stuff, but extensionless files stopped me dead in my tracks.

Thanks,
DarkScion

you make it sound like we're all here to give you your models, and you demand that they be delivered without hassle! lol "I'm not new to all this" do you have an concept of how petty and useless the extensions on a file is? it means nothing.. 

again the files are extension-less, but that DOES NOT MATTER, they are all fpack files.. think of fpack as a zip file. unzip them and you'll get DFF, and TXD, do a google on that and you'll see its a common 3D format used by PS2 games... hint, hint GTA....

I was worried this might happen...
Im sorry if I came off too pushy, I meant no disrespect to anyone who took the time to answer any of my questions. I was just excited that I might finally get the models from this game that I have wanted for so long...

I don't demand that it be done without hassle, I just panicked because I couldn't make what you were explaining work. 

Again, Im sorry for being an @$$hole... I didn't even realize it.
I will look into extracting the files, and hopefully it will work this time.

Thanks,
DarkScion

EDIT: I got another fpk extractor, the drag and drop kind, and tried to extract the files. nothing happened. I also spent about 2 hours, partly this time, and partly from your last post, trying to find the tools on GTA forums.
I couldn't find them...
Since you know which ones to use, could you post a link? 
Thasks, DarkScion

Im serious that I can't figure out what to do next. I've tried searching the GTA forum, I've tried using a gpk extractor to pull out the model and texture files... nothing works. Can someone point me in the right direction?

Hey, thanks youngmark for the quick reply.
I tried the program you mentioned, but it just crashed when I tried to load the files I extracted from the AFS. Chrrox, Mario, are you guys still working on this? Can one of you tell me the program you used to make this work?
You keep giving me hints, but everything I've tried is useless.
Chrrox, I keep mentioning it, but you put a preview of the image of Berzerker, textured and rendered in 3ds max. You were able to make it work- could you direct me to the exact tool you used to extract the textures/models from the fpks?
Thanks

I'm also very interested in importing DFF models into 3DS, can you share your secret please? 
(just came from [THIS](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=4350) topic).

I have all tools needed to extract PS2 FPK and TXD packages (which I can share with you all), but still unable to do anything with new DFF format! 

Please help!

Nice work. Can you tell me how to extract the fpks? The DFF format you should be able to convert, just check my other thread in this subforum, Mario posted the tools needed. If you could post the tools you have for extracting the models from the fpks, that would be awesome.
Thanks

Please upload DFF import/conversion/selfdestruction tool and give a link to the thread you mentioned.
But somehow I doubt it'll help me with the new DFF version I stuck with.

Not all (to tell the truth, almost none) probems could be solved by dragging and dropping. Learn to use command line, dammit! 
<cmd> <file>
AFAIK, no parameters.

Hehehehehe... I DO know how to use command line- it was the parameters I didn't know. But it doesn't matter, because the fpk extractor wasn't  the problem. The fpk files were, as I mentioned, extensionless. I had to rename them to .fpk in order to extract them. Now the only problem is getting them into 3ds max. I know it is possible, earlier in this thread Chrrox was able to do it, with textures and all, but he won't tell me how, and won't respond to pms.

EDIT: I think he hates me. Perhaps you could pm him and ask him how he did it, and with what tools?
That would solve the whole thing.
Thanks,
DarkScion
