Can you also work with texts ? Like repack all texts in BSA or create BSA for X360?

Thx

I'm not planing to create tool for textures or text.
This tool takes PC specific BSA file and makes it compatible with 360.
Use Fallout Mod Manager to create custom BSA files, then convert them with this tool.
I'm saying this cause my prev post wasn't clear completely.
