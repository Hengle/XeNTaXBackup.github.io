- Post Title: Moonlight Blade SFC

I know I'm not the first to try and many people more qualified than me have tried and given up. I'm pretty much teaching myself everything with the internet and some help at random from others when I can get it. So please refrain from telling me how hard this will be. Trust me I know but I am very determined.

My question has to do with extracting from .sfc files. I keep coming across people saying that and have tried using WinRAR, 7zip, something called a VFS file extractor and many others I can't recall.

Also I have just opened .sfc files with Notepad++ and haven't been able to figure out what these black boxes are. Any guidance would be much appreciated.
