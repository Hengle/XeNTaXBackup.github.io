- Post Title: Friday the 13th game question

I have a question about the Friday the 13th game. 

People on other forums  have been trying to figure out how to get until the games files..

With Umodel using the Unreal 4.13 override and Tools/Scan Content.

Has anyone here tried to or been able to, is it possible to 're-colour the characters and 're add them to the game?

"Example 're-colouring
Chad with black hair"

Then adding it back to the game or even making Rob a character in cut scenes playable?
