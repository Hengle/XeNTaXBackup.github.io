- Post Title: Extracting 3D models from PlayStation 2/Xbox/GameCube game archives

Is there a way to extract 3D models from games on PlayStation 2, Xbox, and GameCube?
I have never had to deal with PS games.
I am interested in the 3D models and animations from The Mummy Returns and Terminator 3: The Redemption.

P. S. I apologize for my English, I use a translator.
