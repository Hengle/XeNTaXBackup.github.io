That is absolutely awesome! Works flawless. Do you think you will be able to look into the RNC format?

Security Essentials deletes the file upon downloading. Any thoughts?

Yeah, we've seen this before. The person who made the tool used a pirated version of Delphi that was infected.

yep yep yep, he should rebuild his program with an unpirated version lol. i don't remember which other person had this problem too... it was like a year ago somebody on here was making tools in Delphi and people were complaining about viruses and stuff. there was a news story about it way back when too [http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2009/08/induc/](http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2009/08/induc/).

thanks for the report, updated the link, that one should be without virus.

actually i never had such reports before and i was around for like 2 years already, though recently i downloaded some delphi tools, so they probably could infect my installation...

here's virustotal scan of the new exe

the only positive is by sophos - Mal/FakeAV-L, i guess it's cause of upx compression.

well since other AVs didn't notice anything there, i'd say it's false positive.

but if you're talking about old one, i googled the info about it, it infects only those pcs that have delphi installed. what it does - it replaces some files that allows it to add virus code to each application compiled.

yet i'd reccomend to redownload, it doesn't take much.

Ah alright, it doesn't affect me anyway since I don't have Delphi installed at all. But glad to know this has been now fixed
