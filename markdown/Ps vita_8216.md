Anyone try it yet? Supposedly there are tools to transfer files and a decrypter but I don't have a vita or game to test. Anyone try the tools yet? If they work I'll probably reserve one since the us release is on the 22nd. If not I think I'll wait till it comes down to $199. I mean gee a ps3 is only $249. When these systems come out why are they always so overpriced?

There's already an external decrypter? That was fast. Although I guess it's been out in Japan for a while now. I'm planning to wait for the first price drop to actually buy one myself. Still bitter about buying a PSP at launch and ending up with a screen full of dead pixels. I would like to see a rip of Lord of Apocalypse for the Vita, though. I've been holding off on models for that one on the PSP port to see if the format is the same or not in the Vita port.

Unrelated, I got all of the Queen's Blade stuff you posted. I'll try to have a look at it tomorrow during what would otherwise be my FF13-2 time. Probably going to be stuck working on my own contract stuff for the rest of the night. Hopefully I can put to rest your issue of how to deal with those unicode strings while I'm at it.

Edit: I just realized you're howfie and not finale00, haha. Last paragraph is directed at him. He'll probably see it here eventually anyway.

Amen. $299 is just too much. Yeah supposedly there is. If I am going to brick a vita it better only cost $199 lol.

I won't buy it, doesn't seem that cool. I rather keep my money for Prototype 2.

I recently uploaded [VICE PSP](http://psp.akop.org/vice) on my old PSP, so I won't be needing the new one. Better to wait until Sony are on the brink of launching VITA2 for an extemely high price, so the old VITA you can get for a bargain. Even better is to buy a second hand one during that time, should cost next to nothing.

Any good news about ripping from PS Vita?
(Sorry for replying to old thread...)
I just want to know how to rip from PS Vita Games?
I have a PS Vita and IA/VT-Colorful- (not digital though.) by my own and really want to know how to rip from that game.
I have been transmitted some data of the game to my computer.
I have been heard about something called Henkaku, they say that you MUST HAVE firmware 3.60 or below that. 
(Which i not have...I have 3.63 i think.)
Are there some other alternative game ripping tools I can try?
My main point is to rip 3D-models characters(like hair, clothes, accessories etc.)
If anyone knows, please leave a reply here in this thread or to me privatly.
Thank you!

I have "things" that would be of most high interest to anyone dedicated to PS Vita.  If you are this person, PM me.

Sorry I cannot say more in public.
