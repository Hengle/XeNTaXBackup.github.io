- Post Title: WRC 5 PC [.PAC/.PWS], Someone ?

WRC 5 is released today on PC and as we know the developer is no longer Milestone who used to build WRC games with their MIX file format. The developer, Kylotonn behind WRC 5 used PAC/PWS file format for the game.

Can anyone please check the files and hopefully write unpacker/repacker for the game ?   

PAC file sample :-

type2.pac inside my PAC sample files are just normal ZIPs but type1.pac and PWS files are probably ZIP encrypted
