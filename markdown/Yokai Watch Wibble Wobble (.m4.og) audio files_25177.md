- Post Title: Yokai Watch Wibble Wobble (.m4/.og) audio files

Hey all, I've been trying to find information on these formats for a long time now, but I haven't had any luck on getting any amount of information(Probably because the game has been shut down for more than 5 years).

I've also tried looking at these files but they have no header and just look like a bunch of gibberish.

If you could help me convert these into a playable state, I would really appreciate it.

Also there's a random .pmd file that doesn't have any valuable information (from what I could tell) but i'll leave it in just incase it helps you guys.
