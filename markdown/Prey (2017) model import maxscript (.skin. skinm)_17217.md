- Post Title: Prey (2017) model import maxscript (.skin. skinm)

Hi guys! Here's maxscript to import [PC] Prey (2017) character's/monster's models with bones (3ds max 2009-2014). Game is using a CryTek engine, but some people reported, that current tools doesn't work. So, here's the script in case anyone will need it. Note it's for skinned, not static meshes

My laptop is too weak to run these modelling programs, and it can only run Blender moderately well....I was wondering, if it's not too much trouble to ask, does this get fully skinned and fully rigged models? If so, I was wondering if you could get models of the Operators from Prey for me, converted to dae format, blender format, etc. Anything that Blender can use that's rigged and textured.
