- Post Title: XeNTaX Forum DB crash - explanation

Hi all, 

Yesterday we've experienced a crash in code that addressed the Forum user database. Some accounts were lost and there was no telling what the further impact was. 

Therefore we decided to roll-back the database for one day, to make sure everything was back in order. 

We are very sorry for any lost posts that you may experience and hope for your understanding.

Best regards, 

On behalf of the XeNTaX crew

Great to see the forums up and running in such short space of time! For a moment I thought someone exploited the forum software and that would be really bad.

I only regret the lost of information xD My biggest post ever winded up... so lucky  I'll have to rewrite it a day of these...

Anyway, thanks for keeping this alive, good work!

I will support this community with all I can.
I love game archive exploring, so XeNTaX for me is the Symbol of researching GAFs.

Admins, pls, be cearful. I do not wish this forum to be harmed.
I wish all the best and all best updates in GAFs
