- Post Title: looking for a chuck norris model

I think he would be lol in css or something. Anyone have one or know a game he might be in to rip. Has anyone got a big stack of models they are sharing?

Many thanks.

What prompted me to ask about it was I saw a silly video at youtube that had a chuck norris model in the game oblivion wandering around saying silly things it was quite funny. Maybe I should check out the custom oblivion sites.
