So with the release of Ninja Gaiden 3 we now have a very small alpha demo for Dead or Alive 5 which supposedly comes in at about 300 MB in size. It only has 4 characters and normally I would wait until release before asking but seeing as to how there still isn't even a release date I was wondering exactly how we could go about extracting models from such a thing.

At least post the .lnk file:

[http://www.mediafire.com/?i4lvt9hpm44jr ... 6wzd8f1mx6](http://www.mediafire.com/?i4lvt9hpm44jra1,6809t6wzd8f1mx6)

Same thing as NG3 files, I just changed the .lnk to .bin.

I tried offzip in this one with some options and I only could unpack some small files.

See ya.

Amazing!

How are the models when compared to those from DOA4 or XBV2? Judging from the demo, the models appear to be lower in poly count, but have more detailed textures and shaders.

Any advice on how you extracted the models, or are you still ironing things out?

I don't think those models have lower polycount than doa4/doax2 considering that the bm for both games are the same than doau2/doax from xbox.

Thank you so much for sharing, would you be able to post Ayane as well?

And what program are people using to actually view the model?

There's no use right now, the meshes have no uv's. It's better to wait until bony finishes the tool.
