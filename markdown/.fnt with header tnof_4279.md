Looks so, file header or tail must be "font" and it seems reversed, how to figure it out

I'm not exactly sure of what you mean, but you probably want to change ingame fonts. To do this you need to find font textures. These files you've attached are only configurations for actual fonts. The format is pretty common, there are 8b float values of x1, x2, y1, y2 and some classic spacing values.

Right, and i have modified font textures, bcoz i need now this config file to be figured out to correct character positioning on the map for my characters.

But without researching it i cant do that, coz in that way x, y for each char are dispersed.

Thanks anyway, i have adjusted fonts well enaugh, but if it would be done could be more adjusted, just it.

You can always use a hex editor to easily edit these files. There isn't any software for it as far as I know, mainly because every configuration has slightly different format.
As I've already said, x and y values are stored in 8-byte float divided by width or height in pixels.

Example:
Texture dimensions: 256x256px
Value in your configuration: 00 00 80 3B
3B 80 00 00 converted into float: 0.00390625
0.00390625 Ã— 256 = 1
Means that one of your values is 1.

If you're working with a value of x, you divide / multiply it by texture width. If it's y, you use texture height.
All you need is patience, classic calculator and a hex -> float converter. Hex Workshop has it under name 'Base Converter' and I'm pretty sure there's a lot of them on the inet.
