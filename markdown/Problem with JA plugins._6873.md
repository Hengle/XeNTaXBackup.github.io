- Post Title: Problem with JA plugins.

Hi, I am new to MutiEx Commander, I have Version 4.3.1 Unregistered. I want to donate to the program because this will most likely be very useful. 

But right now it's useless to me.

I can't open a JA file.

Its telling me It's not a valid plugin.

If its a version problem please tell me and send me a new version if you can.

If it's a user error please tell me how to correct it.

Well, 4.3.1 is not supported any more. But was the plugin in the MultiEx Commander package?

Yes, it was. 

It's not supported anyone? I'd like a new version. 

Oh, the install no longer exists. I had to upgrade to Windows 7

The current version is 4.5. 4.3.1 is no longer supported, it differs too much from the latest version.  I'm sure you can find 4.3.1 somewhere else though. 
As for the JA plugin, I may look into that, no guarantees.

I tried to open Train Driver 2005 .JA files with MultiEx Commander 4.5.0 and it worked, no errors. 

See here for the table of contents that MultiEx Commander saved for me, and a picture I extracted.

I just reinstalled it, and it works now.
