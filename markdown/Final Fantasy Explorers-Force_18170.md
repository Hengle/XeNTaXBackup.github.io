- Post Title: Final Fantasy Explorers-Force

Hi, Im looking for assistance in getting the models from the game Final Fantasy Explorers-Force on mobile.
I had thought the game was in Unity engine, but it seems the files are encrypted.

I'm attaching some samples from the android version, hopefully somebody has some luck in figuiring it out.

Thanks.

OK so I found out they are actually CPK files

I tried CriPakTools it just crashed, I tried the bms and it dumped these files

But I still cant make out what they are. 

Any advice on what to look for? I looked at some of the dumped files in hxd, but I still cant find anything recognizable.
I'll upload all the game files as well, in case anyone else wants to take a look.
