- Post Title: The 7th Guest Toolset - ReUpload

Hi to all,

i'm trying to download The 7th Guest Toolset

but the link from

[http://wiki.xentax.com/index.php/The_7th_Guest_Toolset](http://wiki.xentax.com/index.php/The_7th_Guest_Toolset)

are both dead.

The .zip is not-existent and webarchive is stuck on blank page.

Could someone put it on a mirror place (if possible togheter with The 11th hour toolset)?

Thank you very much
