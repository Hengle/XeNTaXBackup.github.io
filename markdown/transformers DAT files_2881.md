if it helps at all, i am interested in the model files since i've managed
to extract audio and video from elsewhere in the game.

i also got a .3ds file out of the game with nova extractor, but blender
had a fatal error and said it wasn't a valid format.

thank you!

edit: i found very large file lists in the middle of the game executable.
if anyone needs the .exe ask and i'll upload it ;]
