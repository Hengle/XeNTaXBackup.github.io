Can someone help and extract this .mod file. Many users of FIFA Games are waiting for months, but none can help. Maybe if @Bigchillghost or some other skilled man can help. Thanks in advance, and take care. Here is the sample:

@Bigchillghost

So thankful, master. I've rename your old script for f20 in order to view the files with noesis and I managed to see textures but meshes can't be seen. Here is your old scripts, maybe it can make job easier and faster. Take care ))

.f21m meshes cannot be viewed, would really appreciate if you update the Noesis script as well.
