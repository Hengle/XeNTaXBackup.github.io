Now i am confused. Do you talk about Call of Duty 4 Modern Warfare Remastered or Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2019? Because the last one i was able to unpack with greyhound tool. And i have legit version on BTNet.

Also Modern Warfare Remastered can be unpacked with DTZxPorter tool Wraith/Archon. But don't expect any re-pack features. It's only unpacker and mostly unpacker of models and textures for Source community. DTZxPorter don't give a sh!t about re-packing.

I mean the last one - Call of Duty 16: Modern Warfare 2019 on BTNet. Greyhound can only unpack *.iwd *.ipak *.xpak and *.sabs *.sabl.It doesn't support *.ff fastfile.
How do you unpack *.ff?

Short answer is that you technically can't anymore.

There were tools that could do that, but of course they're private as are most things in the COD community, and are heavily deprecated because the one guy who works on them, he got tired of doing decompilation. It doesn't work for newer versions of MW/Warzone
