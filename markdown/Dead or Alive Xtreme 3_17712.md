Which version of the game are you using Darko? Japanese only or the subtitled international release?

Hello!   
Thank you very much for the info. I managed to unpack some files: they load correctly in blender, but I'm having some issues with the textures (I copied the Noesis python script in the python folder). Whenever I try to load a model in Noesis, the following message pops up: "TMCL file not found". I can't export the file either. I checked the folder and there is a *.tmcl file along with a *.tmc file.
What am I doing wrong? I couldnt' find a proper answer. Sorry for asking, but I'm a noob.
Thank you.

You have to remove any previous .tmc script from the noesis folder for example the PC version.
