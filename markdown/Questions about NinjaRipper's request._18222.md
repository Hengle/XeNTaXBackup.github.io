- Post Title: Questions about NinjaRipper's request.

The first time in the Android Simulator ripping model work is smooth. Afterwards once again rigged Android's game model always failed and when I press the hotkey I don't get any response, I try to change the hotkey, but it still doesn't work. I don't know what I'm doing wrong. Other games are working properly. If you also encounter this problem, can you help me?
