Hello, the game is very popular in my country and I wanted to localize my language but I could not open the file.
Is there any tool to open the file?

It's GameMaker Archive [http://wiki.xentax.com/index.php/GameMaker_DAT_WIN](http://wiki.xentax.com/index.php/GameMaker_DAT_WIN)

You can use any tool listed on the wiki, e.g. UndertaleModTool.
