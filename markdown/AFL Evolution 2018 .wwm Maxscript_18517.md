maxscript for characters of AFL Evolution 2018

Supported:
  - geometry
  - uv (2 channels)
  - bones
  - weights

Unsupported:
  - everything else

p.s.: models are separated into pieces (body, head etc). To get the full character with single skeleton you need load the models one by one — the script will use existent bones.
p.p.s: I did a full research of the WWM format and I want to thanks zaramot (a local 3ds max guru) for the guidness through the maxscript functions and also for making bones and weights working.

Does it work to export stadiums? I want to export Adelaide Oval and Sydney Showgrounds (Skoda Stadium) to FIFA.

Hi Tosyk,

Would you mind letting me know which order I should load the models one-by-one?

I am having errors running the script and the failure looks to be on the bones assignment, where it complains about type casting a non-integer.

Thanks for your efforts here!
