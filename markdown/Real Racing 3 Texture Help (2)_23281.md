Hello, I'm trying to get the interior textures from Real Racing 3. I'm trying to rip a car, but I am not sure which common file to use. The materials are named "Vehicle Interior_mm_matXX" For example, the XX is 02. Trying to search for the file mat02 yields multiple results! Is there a way to know which file to use?
