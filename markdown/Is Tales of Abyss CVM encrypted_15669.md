- Post Title: Is Tales of Abyss CVM encrypted?

Hello,

I'm really getting interested in modding some of the old games so far I'm using these tools:

- Apache3
- cvm_tool
-DKStudio

DKStudio pretty much has the same function as Apache 3. and I'm aware that the only tool to pack cvm files atm would be the cvm_tool. My Question is how would I know if it's encrypted? currently I'm getting an Error saying it could not read the CVM file I already played with all of cvm's available options. Thanks Guys.

I was able to figure it out, turns out it wasn't encrypted at all the reason why it wasn't working is that it could not locate the file i want to be converted into iso. So I put it into the folder where cvm_tool is saved and that worked.
