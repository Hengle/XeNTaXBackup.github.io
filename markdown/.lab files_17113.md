- Post Title: .lab files

Hi everyone, I have a model in 3ds max to be animated. My game supports .lab formats for animation.

Q1) What is the best export option for animation files in 3ds max?

Q2) If possible, how can I convert my animation into .lab files?

Q3) If anyone is willing to help mainly with .lab files, I would be glad to pay ( Lets Discuss )
