- Post Title: Pinball FX2 .pxa Format

So I'm trying to rip models from the Plants vs Zombies Pinball FX2 board, and I came across some .pxa, .pxt, and .pxm files upon decompressing the archive. I'm pretty sure the .pxa is the model file, and .pxt is the texture file, but I'm not entirely sure. I used a couple quickbms scripts to decompress it, but I'm still stuck. Anyone want to try to figure it out?
