- Post Title: After changing to a new computer, noesis cannot read texture maps when importing models.

All the original files were placed in one folder. After changing to a new computer, the files were placed in the same drive. When executing noesis, only the model can be read. The texture of the model cannot be read. When dragging the action file into it, it cannot be read either. What could be the reason? The entire folder can read the model’s texture and animation on the previous computer…

Sorry, my native language is not English. I used AI to translate it into English. Please forgive me.
