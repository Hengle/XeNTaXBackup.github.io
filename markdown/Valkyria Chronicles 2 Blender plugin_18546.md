- Post Title: Valkyria Chronicles 2 Blender plugin

Hi, I've been wondering since I've been able to get the game files for VC2 I've run into the problem of not having a Blender plugin to open the 3d models of the game. So I've come on here to ask if someone could create a plugin to access to the model files, I'll link a dropbox of the files, the main ones I need to access are the .MLX .MXE .HMD files


Here is a zip of all the files

EDIT: If anyone would give me advice or anything I could do to get these 3d models into Blender...
