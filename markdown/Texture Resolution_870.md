I am wondering which game has the highest resolution textures. Does anything surpass Painkiller?

  Thanks.

Not sure mate, all I know is that most 3D games use at most 128x128 pixels, 256 colors. Some games (eg halflife) also store a 64x64 and 32x32 image for each texture so that the maps draw quicker.

Some newer games may be an exception to this, but i'm not sure.

The texture quality has not got much to do with the overall look of a game. Doom 3 looks good, but I don't think it uses higher resolution textures to do that.

It also depends on what your talking about to.

the smaller the object, the less texture is needed.

Texture sizes aren't really a problem.  The main problem is the combination of texture and polygons.  A building in a distance, might have 5 sides each with a different texture at like 512x512 or higher.  but a person might have 100-10000 polygons each with a different texture.

2 Problems come into play.  each polygon on a person has to calculated and most are at different angles than the others.  the other is if the pixel format of the texture doesn't match the screens pixel format, then it has to perform a convertion.
