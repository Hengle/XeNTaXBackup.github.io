lol it seems u don't like the search function of the forum .
Anyway here u go:

[http://aluigi.altervista.org/papers/bms/yuke.bms](http://aluigi.altervista.org/papers/bms/yuke.bms)    save the page as yuke.bms
You need to dowload quickbms program from aluigi's site.

Run it > select the yuke script> select the archive u want estract > select the folder u want extract in.

Are you sure your game is supported by the maxscript?

Chrrox said it works for 2011 models but other people were complaining about 2012 models not being loaded. I don't know if he updated it afterwards.

And milkshape, don't know what their plugin imports.

You seem to want 2012 models from your numerous threads.
