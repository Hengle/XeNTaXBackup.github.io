- Post Title: Mahjong Dream Club (X360) - CRI cpk variant

These cpk variants are seemingly missing the TOC table, but there are additional files with UTF identifier that eventually hold it. I'm not experienced enough to adjust Luigi's script for this type of CPK, so maybe anyone can take a look at this? I've cut out the start of the file and added the UTF: [http://www.sendspace.com/file/2h053y](http://www.sendspace.com/file/2h053y)
Thanks for yout help!

Try this: [http://hcs64.com/files/utf_tab07b7_special.zip](http://hcs64.com/files/utf_tab07b7_special.zip)
It doesn't look at the .acb but I think it'll at least the files for you.

Hey cool, worked fine, thanks!  Was able to retrieve the names manually from the acb.
