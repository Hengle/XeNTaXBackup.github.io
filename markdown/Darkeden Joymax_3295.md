Well I can't find a way to uncompress it.

i did rar/zlib stuff and yet no luck. its compressed with .dp2 as extension.

Ive been re-searching for it for 4days now and still cant find a way to uncompress it.

It contain some info (.dp2) files and a exeswapper. <- i think this is what they used to pack/unpack from darkeden.dpk
