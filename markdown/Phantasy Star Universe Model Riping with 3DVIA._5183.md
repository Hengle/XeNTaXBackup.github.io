- Post Title: Phantasy Star Universe Model Riping with 3DVIA.

I'm trying to use 3DVIA to extract models from it, but as soon as a 3D model is going to load the game crashes. (I do have no Gameguard EXE for both Expansion and Original, still both crash.)

I know someone who uses Vista 32 bit and it works fine with it. [http://i56.tinypic.com/o89g5e.jpg](http://i56.tinypic.com/o89g5e.jpg)

But I have Windows 7 64 Bit Myself, but it refuses to work, I changed game options from highest to lowest settings and to mid and etc still crashes.

Anyone know why this would be happening? It works fine with other games I have.

have you tried the counterpart of 3DVIA which is 3DRipperDX? it works just the same as 3DVIA but much more easy to handle. just google it  youll need 3ds max to import 3dr format though 3d max8+ would work fine.

goodluck
