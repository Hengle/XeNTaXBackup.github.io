Does anyone know something about this file format(.paq)? 

The engine for LOTR War In The North is Dark Alliance Engine by Snowblind Studios for PC.

Here is a file sample of a 3D Models archive:

I've posted here just before the forums went down. So I'm assuming the post got lost in the nether due to that.

I've tried the script myself, and sadly it seems to not exact anything at all generally.

I can provide a cut version of the PAQ with the archive cutters here. I assume that is not against the new rules. Though I will admit I'm somewhat unsure about that.
