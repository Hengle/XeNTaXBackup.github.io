This game will be in a 0.hrs file which you can unpack via [quickbms](http://aluigi.altervista.org/bms/unreal_tournament_4.bms). Once you get the base .uasset files you can use [umodel](http://gildor.org/en/projects/umodel#files) from Gildor to extract the models and animations.

I sent the Lineage 2 Revolution Data.pak file to Drawing, so let's see if he can crack that open!
I wasn't able to get much passed seeing into it, Content.bin was inside but it's encrypted...

Same, and I tried running through all keys available.
Looks like there's something else we'd have to use =/

Hi guys,

newcomer here but been lurking around for a while. Thanks for UE4 unpacker. Worked perfectly on HIT however have question. Is it possible to repack back to hrs file after you edit what you want or this script is only for unpacking?

many thanks

EDIT: I have sorted this now, just run quickbms with -r -w command

As the error is telling you, you're most likely trying to repack a file which is bigger than the original. You can't do that.

I'm trying to unzip the game's cache. But the program gives an error. What is the error I can not understand.

Could someone upload the newest .hrs file, as of the latest patch? 
And can this .hrs file be extracted?

Thanks,
