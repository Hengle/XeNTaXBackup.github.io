- Post Title: Wii - House of the Dead Overkill sound files

Hello all.

Been looking over the possible audio files from House of the Dead Overkill on the Wii.

All the sound named ones have an extension of REV.
When checked under any hex utility and scan to near the end of the file you will see text showing normal audio file formats

eg
music_boss_l3_l5.wav.str.music_boss_l3_l5.wav, etc

Supplied archivecutter file of 500KBs, if need a full file I can easily supply one if this doesn't help.

Thank you
