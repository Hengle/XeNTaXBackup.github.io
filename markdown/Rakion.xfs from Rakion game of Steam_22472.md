Hello everyone, for a long time I have been trying to unpack this file (Rakion.xfs) it is from a game from my childhood called Rakion, now I see that there is a Steam version, and the desire to extract some models has resurfaced , but I have hit a wall, since I have not found much information about how to unpack this file (Rakion.xfs), inside this file is (animation.xfs, classes.xfs, controls.xfs, modelssv.xfs , textures.xfs..etc) I can open these with a program called iXFS, the problem is unpacking the rakion.xfs. I have seen that some open it with this program called SoIFS Explorer, but when trying to open it asks me for a key, anyway I will attach those files, maybe someone has a better idea of ​​how to open it or find the key, thank you very much.

Your sample is very interesting, this type of archive can support ZLIB compression and AES encryption.
I have started documenting it here [http://wiki.xentax.com/index.php/Eldos_ ... tem_ST_XFS](http://wiki.xentax.com/index.php/Eldos_Solid_File_System_ST_XFS)

To get a valid password, you probably need to do some debugging on game executable.
Here are some tutorials how to start with this [viewtopic.php?f=29&t=22266](https://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=29&t=22266)

Btw, I have downloaded Rakion Chaos Force from Steam, but my Rakion.xfs file has different size,
so the developers may changing this archive with every release of the new client and it means that
password can also be different with every release.

Hello ikskoks! thanks for reply! other information that I have found, but I am not entirely sure it is true, I have read that that key can be obtained when the client is updating, and about the rakion.xfs, yeah it changes every time there is an update, the funny thing is that you have to download everything back (Rakion.xfs), it is not like other games that only new content is added to it, or at least that happened to me. About the password can change every time they update, I have also read that it is, but I'm not entirely sure if it is true or not, maybe they keep it in small updates, or since you have to download the entire rakion.xfs in every update, it have a new password. I'll post the nyxlauncher and rakion.bin, and some other archives that can helped. Thanks for your time.

Hello ikskoks, the steam client seems that not launch the nyxlauncher at all, there is another rakion server, called rakion latin and this one execute the nyxlauncher for patching! maybe it will be easier to get the password and this server is more updated.

I don't know if I'm reviving a dead thread or not, I really hope it remains alive.

As of today, using the Steam version of Rakion, I have found two AES keys:

128-bit AES:
Encryption Key: 807b0cddc387d2571d1f1ad052902e99
Decryption key: 807b0cddc387d2571d1f1ad052902e99

Encryption key: 9f2aa5126bbeae02fcc1e87e7624d57d
Decryption key: 9f2aa5126bbeae02fcc1e87e7624d57d

I do not know however how to find the secret. I wonder if it is possible to use these keys to extract the files.
