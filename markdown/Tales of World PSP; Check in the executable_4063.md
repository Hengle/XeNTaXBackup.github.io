- Post Title: Tales of World PSP; Check in the executable

Hi all I have a tiny problem... 

I'd like to translate Tales Of The World Radiant Mythology but i think that there could be some check inside the executable that prevents me to modify scr files (which are just gzip files renamed). I have to keep the original LBA.

Could someone help me please?
