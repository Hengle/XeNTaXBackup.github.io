I could use something, maybe even a script, to properly extract these, since the audio files are sped up through PSound: [https://drive.google.com/open?id=1DVX8R ... YWz9Pyw8Um](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1DVX8RP47dq9lHrEc-QTEOcYWz9Pyw8Um)

Hi,

inside .mcd files contains some lznp files, its a compression file a LZ variant compression.

Use the bms script that i wrote to extract lnzp files from .MCD

Then use lnzp.exe to decompress the files.

lnzp.ex only works in 32bits system, you can use a virtual machine with windows xp 32 bits or DOS BOX.

I tried it and it says the app cannot run on my software. I upgraded to an HP Omen.
