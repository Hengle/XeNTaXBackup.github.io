- Post Title: Dark Souls 2 .TPF

Does anyone have anything on Dark Souls 2 *.TPF files? These seem to be texture pack files, like in the previous game, however the Noesis plugin for Dark Souls 1 doesn't work with these new files.

DSExplore works for the BDTs and BNDs and all that, though.

I've found nothing on how to view these TPFs...

Going from memory, they've changed slightly in format, but the big thing to note about any .TPF file for Dark Souls 1 & 2 is that the actual content (texture) stored inside is going to be in a format specific to the platform the .TPF file was created for.

That is, a .DDS file for PC, and another format who's name escapes me, for PS3.

As a side note, I think the bhd/bdt files for DS2 work in DSExplore only because I put support in there so I could poke around myself, and forgot about it when I released it, heh.

Looks like the file you gave starts from "xff" instead of "Nemo Fi" - maybe it's just an uncompressed version of .nmo, I don't know yet. Shadow of the Colossus is definitely made in 3DVIA, according to google.
