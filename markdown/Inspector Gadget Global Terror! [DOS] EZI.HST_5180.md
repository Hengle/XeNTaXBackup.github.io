I was using Awave Studio again, and I found out that EZI.HST is a MIDI-like sequence. Obviously I converted it to a .MID file.

Download EZI.HST: [https://docs.google.com/leaf?id=0B-Tp7j ... MDFl&hl=en](https://docs.google.com/leaf?id=0B-Tp7j4ENOEvMDgwZGEwNjQtNzMwMy00YjIyLWJlMjYtNzg0YTAwNGNjMDFl&hl=en)

 Could some one please tell me what format EZI.HST is?
