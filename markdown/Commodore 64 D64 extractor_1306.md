- Post Title: Commodore 64 D64 extractor

Plugin: D64 files
-------------------



I had created a prog that would open .D64 files (Commodore 64 disk images). 

I turned it into a plugin for MultiEx Commander. 

Now those 8-bit geeks with long beards that, like me, come from the C64 era, can open and extract from the .D64 files. 

Why? For old time's sake.  Call it a salute to that fabulous machine.   

Get the attached zip file and unzip it in the /data/plugins directory (so you should have a "d64" directory in the plugins folder).

Hint: Attached files can only be downloaded if you have registered (free) at this forum.
