Hey, I'm back! So, I'm trying to create GENH's from these files with VGMToolbox, but I can't find the right parameters. I also can't rely on a hex editor, cause I'm not sure how to use it. Here are samples files:

Thanks in advance!

EDIT: I managed to play them with VGMStream without GENH, but the quality isn't the best. Any ideas?
