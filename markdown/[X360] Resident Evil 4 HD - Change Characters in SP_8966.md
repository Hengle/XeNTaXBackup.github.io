- Post Title: [X360] Resident Evil 4 HD - Change Characters in SP

Hello,

I was wondering if it was possible for someone to tell me how to change characters in the Single Player of Resident Evil 4 HD on the Xbox 360.

In the game, you normally play as one character (Leon), but you can also play as other characters in another game mode called "The Mercenaries". It is easy to swap characters from The Mercenaries to the Single Player on the PC, but I do not have the PC version of the game. I was wondering if anyone could tell me how, or kindly do it for me. I want to play as Hunk (guy with the gas mask) from The Mercenaries in Single Player. If someone can swap those models for me, or tell me how to do so, I'd greatly appreciate it.

Here's a tool someone made to swap models on the PC, if that helps: [http://z6.invisionfree.com/Resident_Evi ... opic=13307](http://z6.invisionfree.com/Resident_Evil_4_PC/index.php?showtopic=13307)

I'll also provide my gamesave below, should that be needed.

Thanks!
