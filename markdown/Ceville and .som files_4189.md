- Post Title: Ceville and .som files

Hi,

i would like to translate this funny game to spanish, but there is a problem. Dialogs are in differents folders (two files for each "level" folder), with extension *.som and they are encrypted. I'm not sure if the file is compressed as well.  I tried to unpack it with gobread (really useful tool) but the extension is not recognised. I cannot find nothing to see the text in this type of files. Anybody can help me?

Regards.

The files are XOR-ed with password
