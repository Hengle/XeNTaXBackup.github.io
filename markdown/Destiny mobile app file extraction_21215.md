- Post Title: Destiny mobile app file extraction

Heya people,

Wondering... I'm attempting to extract the 3D models from the Destiny android app.
While I've experience with PC game ripping etc etc unfortunately I've never messed with anything within android.

There are a series of .TGXM and .JSON files within the app that are around 600KB, I'm assuming that they may be low-poly versions of the in-game avatar but as of yet I've had no luck extracting the file type to anything I could use as a model.
