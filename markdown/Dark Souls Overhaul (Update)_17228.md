- Post Title: Dark Souls Overhaul (Update)

Hi!

Just a quick update on the overhaul project: There's been a massive leap in progress in terms of what we can do with animations.
So we're reaching out to all those interested in contributing to the project that have expertise in animating & 3d modeling. Ideally experience with 3dsmax.

For a more detailed list on whatâ€™s being worked on please see:
