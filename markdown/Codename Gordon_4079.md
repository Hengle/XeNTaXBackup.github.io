this game (which can be installed from steam using steam://install/92) is nothing else than a flash game.
so open cg.exe and search for the string CWS (the signature of the flash files).
now that you have the swf file you must handle it as all the other similar files so I guess exist specific extractors/disassemblers.

if you will find nothing then use the "raw" way.
use offzip for unpacking the flash file in one of about 44 mb and then use a resource ripper to dump all the files in it like the jpg images.
the rest of the archive is composed by compressed raw images that you can extract with offzip but I don't have the minimal idea of their width and height (I guess they are at 24 or 32 bits)

I suggest you use Nova Extractor ([http://www.volny.cz/nova-software/files/extr25.zip](http://www.volny.cz/nova-software/files/extr25.zip)) to scan for SWF files. For decomposing, I always use Sothink SWF Decompiler.
