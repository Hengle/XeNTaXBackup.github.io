I've created a new Commodore 64 SID tune, there's the MP3 of the actual audio capture.

it looks like the title screen bgm in a bomberman game or something...
not that it is a bad thing or anything...i like it, it really gives you the feeling of a track in an old game
why did you capture it and not give the original file btw?
