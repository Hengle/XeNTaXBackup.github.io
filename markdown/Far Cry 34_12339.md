Headless Noore Najjar from Far Cry 4.
Still has good balance though.

Thanks go out to Chipicao, vagos21, and Rick for all the information.
And a big thanks to Szkaradek for his Avatar importer. I would have been totally lost on the proper bone IDs without it.
(how did you ever figure all that out anyway? ಥ_ಥ)

I'll see if I can't find the energy to work on importing multiple meshes to complete the characters as well as materials.

Wow someone actually does this inside Maya, as a Maya user, big thanks!

When we can expect a download? Also UVs are working?

I'm working on UVs right now. Need to find the matching textures so I can check them out.
After that - download.

If I may share some insight, the meshes are not resized with bounding boxes. They use mad shader instructions with float constants stored in each xbg file.
Specifically, in the PMCP chunk (Position Constant Multiplier?) you will find two 32-bit floats. Each vertex coordinate is calculated like this: vp = vp*float2 + float1. Then you will get correct sizes.

It's probably the same result, more or less. but this way you'll know for sure it's accurate.
The same thing is done with texture coordinates using data from the PMCU chunk. You will see that many xbg models need a certain scaling for the UV.

You can see it all in action in my maxscript.

Good luck with your research!

Ahhh. Many thanks.
As far as the BBox's go........but would the code look as impressive. 

EDIT:
Scripts - [https://app.box.com/s/bq6q1us31ja5vo7wrq7hgc3r5mno32p1](https://app.box.com/s/bq6q1us31ja5vo7wrq7hgc3r5mno32p1)
NumPy - [https://app.box.com/s/jfh8lcrq5vg4odp5yl4x03w4crlyuvlx](https://app.box.com/s/jfh8lcrq5vg4odp5yl4x03w4crlyuvlx)

Bad:
• Only tested on 1 Far Cry 3 model and 1 Far Cry 4 model (too scared to try any more than that)
• No normals yet
• Only uses first UV set
• File version handling not complete
• Have to manually assign textures (I don't see this ever changing actually)
• Needs more NumPy
• Might get an attitude and beat your dog relentlessly  

Good:
• Skin
• Now uses correct vertex and UV scales and offsets per Chipicao's instructions
• Supports character models made up of various parts (at least that one FC4 model I tried)
• Will NOT beat your dog
• Creates basic lambert materials with proper names (click image below)

[](http://i.imgur.com/maekLoP.png)

I guess the wireframe kinda obscures the point about texture assignments working.......this should illustrate things a bit better: [http://mrfuzzlebum.deviantart.com/art/P ... 1418081001](http://mrfuzzlebum.deviantart.com/art/Posing-n-Junk-499130483?ga_submit_new=10%253A1418081001)

Oh that was genius! I put the wrong file in there.
I fixed it. Anyway, open FC34.py in the script editor then click the >> button.
Make sure it's the >> button and not the > button.
The > button will run the script and erase everything at the same time - not sure what the idea behind that was.

OK, I'm not using Microsoft's OneDrive anymore.
Evidently if you create a link to it, it's like a snapshot.
It has something like a history built into it.
Or, in other words, it's not "live". (Irony?)
You can't change something and keep using the same link.
The link will show the contents of that OneDrive folder's state as of the time you create the link.

Oh well, anyway works fine now  

Testing the characters now, one thing, you said that only the first UV is working, there are characters/meshes with two or more sets of UV?

What unpacked did you used for FC4? Used the Dunia2 from Rick, the one posted on the first page but couldn't find the characters, unless they were in __UNKNOWN folder but the filenames are not really helping so I have no idea how to ID the characters and textures. Using QuickBMS now, currently extracting but so far lot of files with useless extension.

I updated the original link on page 1.
I fixed a problem where the mesh names began with a number and killed the importer.
CMihai - you might be interested in a new file I added.   


Sooooooo, I decided to try and create an importer for Blender 2.72 and for the life or me I can't figure out how to import bones.
I've looked at tons of reference code/importers and still can't get it to work.
I included it in the off chance anyone knows of such forbidden knowledge.

O shit, more than interested, now that's a very welcomed file  

Talking about problems with mesh names starting with numbers, got BSOD'ed like 5 times today since I was randomly trying to import files =)

Edit: Also, there's no weight for FC4 models? Eh for some work for some doesn't I get this error when it doesn't work.

That name issue was supposed to be the problem I fixed.   

Well, nevermind. I think I fixed a really nasty bug.
Probably the same one you experienced (not the name thing).
I updated the link again.

It was caused by..............................................

.
&*%^&#ing  Python indentation!

Now you might end up with a mangled mesh, but nothing should crash now.
Gotta overhaul some more stuff n' junk.

Fixed a bunch of junk.

I was really trying to avoid dealing with submeshes - looking at that part of Chipicao's importer still makes me dizzy.
But it looks like you have to if the mesh has more than 1 vertex buffer.

hmmmmm...... forum doesn't like emojis.

• Removed NumPy from the Maya importer - should improve compatibility
• Added rough support for Far Cry 2 and Avatar (FC2 still needs some work)
• Made a WIP importer for Softimage (no materials yet)
• Sat in a deck chair in my underwear in front of a black velvet painting of a sad crying clown in an iron lung and laughed hysterically for 10 minutes
• Made a WIP importer for Blender 2.73
• Kicked some Geese in the face
• Made a WIP importer for Lightwave
• Made a WIP importer for Noesis
• Made a very rough importer for Houdini (just imports a singe object, not too useful yet)

Maya is still the best of the lot, but Softimage is close behind.
I'll work on this junk again sometime in January.

......(Python indentation is going to be the death of me!)..........

My favorite text editor is Notepad++. 
All scripts write in this editor.
I  open script in Blender and Notepad++. When  save script in notepad++, in Blender text window menu create red icon for reload a text.
And for python indentation select text block and use tab key or lshift+tab for transform this block. 
Use always tab not space key.

Thanks Szkaradek.
I usually use  Notepad++, but I still managed to mess up a block of code somehow.
I didn't even know about the text reload option in Blender. And I totally agree with the tab thing.
With the hap-hazard way I go about coding, spaces mess me up - I pretty much have to use tabs.

A bit off topic, but how much do you know about importing animation into Blender?
Models are no problem, but when I tried to import animation into Blender it wouldn't work for anything.
I tried every type of space transform I could think of.

```
I know we have 2 methods to get position of bone in every frame.
 - method ARMATURESPACE - it is transform bone relative to skeleton
 - method BONESPACE - it is tranform bone relative to bone parent

For transform bone we have:
 - eulers and quaternions - for rotation
 - vectors - for position 
 - matrices - rotation, position and scale in one math object
 
 
 
 I use in most cases matrices 4x4. I try all convert to this matrices.
 How convert:
 posmatrix = convert vector to matrix4x4
 rotmatrix = convert euler to matrix4x4 or convert quaternion to matrix
 Blender use for quaternions: w,x,y,z  like  1,0,0,0
 But when import quat from game we get for this case x,y,z,w : 0,0,0,1, 
 so we need convert gamequat to blenderquat (translate value w to first place)
 
 
 
 I created 3 cases to get position for bone in each frame: (all code i got from actionLib.py from my importers)
 
 1.when bone have only rotation transform:
 
	for n in range(len(actionbone.rotFrameList)): - list of all rotation frames for this bone 
		frame=actionbone.rotFrameList[n] - get frame
		bonematrix=actionbone.rotKeyList[n] - get rotation matrix 4x4 for current frame
		if self.ARMATURESPACE is True: - method
			pbone.poseMatrix=bonematrix 
			pbone.insertKey(skeleton, 1+frame,[Blender.Object.Pose.ROT],True) - insert key only for rotation
			pose.update() - this command i don't understand what is really make, sometimes animation works without this command
		if self.BONESPACE is True: - method
			if pbone.parent:		
				pbone.poseMatrix=bonematrix*pbone.parent.poseMatrix - multiply bone matrix and parent matrix, when bone has parent
			else:
				pbone.poseMatrix=bonematrix
			pbone.insertKey(skeleton, 1+frame,[Blender.Object.Pose.ROT],True)
			pose.update()
 

 2.when bone have only position transform: 
 
	for n in range(len(actionbone.posFrameList)):- list of all position frames for this bone 
		frame=actionbone.posFrameList[n] - get frame
		bonematrix=actionbone.posKeyList[n] - get position matrix 4x4 for current frame
		if self.ARMATURESPACE is True:
			pbone.poseMatrix=bonematrix
			pbone.insertKey(skeleton, 1+frame,[Blender.Object.Pose.LOC],True)
			pose.update()
		if self.BONESPACE is True:
			if pbone.parent:		
				pbone.poseMatrix=bonematrix*pbone.parent.poseMatrix
			else:
				pbone.poseMatrix=bonematrix
			pbone.insertKey(skeleton, 1+frame,[Blender.Object.Pose.LOC],True) - insert key only for position
			pose.update()
			
3.when bone have rotation and position tranform:
	
								
	for n in range(len(actionbone.matrixFrameList)): - list of all position frames for this bone 
		frame=actionbone.matrixFrameList[n] - get frame
		bonematrix=actionbone.matrixKeyList[n]  - get matrix 4x4 (position rotation in one) for current frame
		if self.ARMATURESPACE is True:
			pbone.poseMatrix=skeleton.matrixWorld*bonematrix
			pbone.insertKey(skeleton, 1+frame,[Blender.Object.Pose.ROT,Blender.Object.Pose.LOC],True)
			pose.update()
		if self.BONESPACE is True:
			if pbone.parent:		
				pbone.poseMatrix=bonematrix*pbone.parent.poseMatrix - multiply bone matrix and parent matrix, when bone has parent
			else:
				pbone.poseMatrix=bonematrix
			pbone.insertKey(skeleton, 1+frame,\
				[Blender.Object.Pose.ROT,Blender.Object.Pose.LOC],True)
			pose.update() 			

	
It was all for Blender 249.

I updated the Maya importer and link (first page, 2/3 of the way down).
There's a new file to place in Maya's Python site-packages folder so make sure to do that.
I fixed an issue with the materials and added support for all 4 uv maps.

And here's an updated list of Pagan Min parts to mix and match as you please.

```


I still haven't been able to find the diffuse hair textures anywhere.
I even converted some of the DX10 textures trying to find it.

Thanks for fixing Pagan! About the hair diffuse, I think that maybe it could be ripped directly from the game, though I'm not completely sure about that.

Hey guys, I'm trying to load the script in Maya, but I keep getting this error:

```
# Error: line 1: ImportError: file <maya console> line 8: No module named numpy # 
```


How can I fix this? Is something missing in my Python folder?

Yeah, seems like thedude used [http://www.numpy.org/](http://www.numpy.org/) maybe.

How does it work exactly? Putting the numpy files in the python folder is not enough, so I'm not really sure how its installation works.

what file did you download? this one?

[http://sourceforge.net/projects/numpy/files/NumPy/](http://sourceforge.net/projects/numpy/files/NumPy/)

Download the superpack installer 2.7 in version 1.92 folder. It will require python 2.7 installed on your system.

I think I took it out to decrease the file size of the archive. Then I was going to upload it separately and post the link,but I guess I forgot. ٩◔̯◔۶

Ah so that was my problem: I apparently had tried to install a wrong version for Numpy. Thank you both, the one posted by TheDude seems to work perfectly now.

The only issue now is that I still can't get Pagan's eyebrows... I got the latest script, so I don't really know why that happens.

I don't know how I managed to leave this out of the list, but the model of Min's face with his eyebrows is 9C44E182FDE38402.xbg.

Also grepWin is what I use to find specific models. [http://stefanstools.sourceforge.net/grepWin.html](http://stefanstools.sourceforge.net/grepWin.html)
..just throwing that out there

About ~19000 files from ...data_win32\worlds\fcc_main\fcc_main_unpack\__UNKNOWN\gfx for Far Cry 4:

xbg file: each file have skeleton inside  - for file name can use first bone name
xbt file: for some files can use file path inside

Here is a script for parsing all files from directory ..data_win32\worlds\fcc_main\fcc_main_unpack\__UNKNOWN\gfx
It creates new file types: 
 - *.mesh with name of first bone - for xbg file . It is xbg file but has only new name. File inside has no change.
 - *.mat - from bin files - it can use to get texture path for material name from file with model
 - *_norm.dds - for normal and bump maps
 - *.dds - for others maps

How to use:
1. instal Blender 249 and Python 266
2. double click Blender249.blend
3. in Blender Text Window press alt+p and select any file from ...data_win32\worlds\fcc_main\fcc_main_unpack\__UNKNOWN\gfx and wait.

• Removed NumPy from the Maya importer - should improve compatibility
• Added rough support for Far Cry 2 and Avatar (FC2 still needs some work)
• Made a WIP importer for Softimage (no materials yet)
• Sat in a deck chair in my underwear in front of a black velvet painting of a sad crying clown in an iron lung and laughed hysterically for 10 minutes
• Made a WIP importer for Blender 2.73
• Kicked some Geese in the face
• Made a WIP importer for Lightwave
• Made a WIP importer for Noesis
• Made a very rough importer for Houdini (just imports a singe object, not too useful yet)

Maya is still the best of the lot, but Softimage is close behind.
I'll work on this junk again sometime in January.
Привет всем! А кто импортировал анимацию из  данной игры в Maya?

so you can import animations into maya from far cry 4 and 3, you can do that with this maya script?

I realise this thread and the contents therein are aging fast, but with Far Cry 5 around the corner, I've been looking back at some of the older games and looking at pulling models from 4 in particular, however, when I try to run the Maya script, I get this error: 

# Error: line 0: ImportError: file <maya console> line 4: No module named bitreader

Anyone able to clarify what the problem might be here? I was kinda hoping there might be a blender tool out there akin to the Far Cry Primal one, and the Max Script doesn't seem to be able to carry weights across.

I'm looking for a way to get a preview of all the 3D models used in Far Cry 4. Here's what I got so far:TheDude's Blender importer script: Couldn't get it working. Here's what I did:
Using Blender 2.78
CTRL+ALT+U --> install from file
Results:Code: Select allfound bundled python: C:\Program Files\Blender Foundation\Blender\2.78\python
fake_module: addon missing 'bl_info' gives bad performance!: 'Blender\\2.78\\scripts\\addons\\test_Blender273.py'
fake_module: addon missing 'bl_info' gives bad performance!: 'Blender\\2.78\\scripts\\addons\\test_Blender273.py'
fake_module: addon missing 'bl_info' gives bad performance!: 'Blender\\2.78\\scripts\\addons\\test_Blender273.py'
Modules Installed from 'c:\\temp\\test_Blender273.py' into 'Blender\\2.78\\scripts\\addons' ()Yet I don't know how to enable the plugin, I think it doesn't show up in my installed plugins list. Could it be because I already have volfin's Far Cry Primal xbg importer script in there already?
TheDude's Maya importer script install
to get this working:
1. Copy the files from FarCry34.rar\Maya\Dependencies to your maya's 'site-packages' folder, i.e. C:\Program Files\Autodesk\Maya2015\Python\Lib\site-packages
2. Extract the Maya_numpy.rar contents into C:\Program Files\Autodesk\Maya2017\Python\Lib\site-packages as well.
3. Open and run the FarCry34.rar\Maya\FC34_Maya.py in Maya from the Script Editor: Windows > General Editors > Script Editor.
Chipicao's 3DSMax importer plugin
So far, I've been most pleased with Far Cry Primal 3DSMax plugin from Chipicao in 3DSMax. Seems to load the models just fine.

However, I'm actually looking for a way to get ALL FC xbg's rendered to a preview jpg and manually loading them one by one into 3DS/Maya isn't really cutting it. I was thinking Noesis would be the weapon of choice if it would allow for a preview of the xbg, but I'm getting an error with [TheDude's Noesis plugin](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?p=101460#p101460):

```
Noesis Python Error
---------------------------
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "Noesis\plugins\python\FC34_Noesis.py", line 580, in XBGLoadModel
    weightData = bonesWeightsWhomp(VB, majorRevision)
  File "Noesis\plugins\python\FC34_Noesis.py", line 140, in bonesWeightsWhomp
    return(weightsLOC, boneSubIDsLOC)
UnboundLocalError: local variable 'weightsLOC' referenced before assignment

```

Would anyone know a way to fix the Noesis script? I added an assignment for several variable names reported by Python, but ultimately got stuck when the line "for g in range(len(vbBIDS[n])):" produced a list index out of bounds error.

I have tried to open xbg file from FarCry 5, and its unsuccessful.
Is there any plan for update the script, so that it can import xbg model from FarCry5.
