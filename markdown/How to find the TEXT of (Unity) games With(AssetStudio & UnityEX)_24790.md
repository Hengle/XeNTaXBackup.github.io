- Post Title: How to find the TEXT of (Unity) games With(AssetStudio & UnityEX)

Hi everyone.
I wanted to say that I want to know how to find and extract the text of games made by Unity.
I use two software to find the text, the first is AssetStudio and the second is UnityEX.
But when I want to find the text of the game among many, many files, it becomes almost impossible.
And there are so many files that you can not find the text of the game at all.
I wanted to say that does anyone know how to find the text of the game?

After extracting assets you can use Total Commander method to find the text you need

Exactly as ikskoks says. This is where your game text is. resources.assets

thanks a lot.
But I have a question, the name of the text file in each of the Unity games is different.
And because the number of files is so very large, how do I go through all these files and find the text I want? Due to the fact that the text file names are different in each game.

I used the method Ikskoks is talking about.
