- Post Title: Blizzard's Heartstone

By now everyone probably heard that Blizzard is bringing out a new game called Heartstone, which was very well playable on GamesCom in Germany this year.

I just got a beta invite for the game !!

Anyhow, the game has been created by Unity 3D!!

and the assests are stored in a .unity3d extension format 

Just to let you know...
