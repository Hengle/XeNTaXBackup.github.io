- Post Title: Tales from the Borderlands. translation HELP!

i am korean and wants to translate this game to korean.
extracting ttarch2 and landb to txt, translating txt's... that was easy, but i don't know how to do after that.
when this game was released, we have a translation team and they successfully translated episode 1 - zer0 sum.
but shortly after that, they disbanded.
because they dissappeared from korean forum, i can't even ask the former members of that team.
what should i do next to translate?

You would just do the same in the opposite order (i guess you use TTGTools).
So you translate the text compile .landb files from the again and what i usually do create just a new 0.ttarch with the tranlsated .landb files. It will be used like a patch then.

I tried your method, but the game won't read my new file. displaying original english subtitles.
i think it needs a additional .lua file...
