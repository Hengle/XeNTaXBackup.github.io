- Post Title: Persian Rug tool 'Bin unpack' tab missing?

Hi. As seen in my other thread: 
[viewtopic.php?f=10&t=9269](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=9269)

I need help extracting the .bin files. So far, I have had no such luck with the programs that I've tried so far. But I will not give in just yet! There is another program which I read up that also has the ability to extract .bin files, but I can find no such site that has a valid download link to it. The program is called, Persian Rug: [http://wiki.xentax.com/index.php/Persian_Rug](http://wiki.xentax.com/index.php/Persian_Rug). I know that XeNTaX has it listed in its wiki page, but since the original creator abandoned this project his site also went along with it. 

So I'm asking, would be possible if someone could re-upload it somewhere?

Thanks a bunch. With a mods permission, this program's download link should be updated.

I have yet another problem I am currently facing. The first time when I opened up Persian Rug, I was greeted with 5 main tabs:
[Resource file explorer][Bin unpack][Bin analyzer][Options][Display]. I then proceeded to unpack a random .bin file. Strange, the way the program unpacks the bin files is that it renames the file extensions to .unpackedbin. The file becomes its unpacked state (about twice its original size). 

So, with not knowing what to do next, I close the program. When I launch it later... surprise, surprise, the 'Bin unpack' tab is completely gone from the main bar. What gives?!

hey Caustic i tried the "Persian rug" many times ago and i forget it ... i think it is useless for extraction 
because when it started the extraction it ripped the same 3d models for hundred times !!! like a ripple !
i think you should look for a better way ?

Here are the programs that I've tried so far:

jadepack.exe By: Xor37h/Hitmen - Program errors out while trying to unpack .bin file
unpack.exe By: Xor37t/hitmen - Same deal as above... program gives error while trying to unpack .bin file
Persian Rug By: Turfster - I can't even access the 'bin unpacker' tab anymore... program is broken. 

There's gotta be something else that I've missed. Maybe there's a BMS script that can unpack Jade Engine .bin files.
