Use Jonwil's binview ([http://www.cncmods.net/](http://www.cncmods.net/)) from the sdk extras to extract audio (not music)

attached file is ealayer3 encoded seemingly.

I would like to .wav sound files to convert and then convert back to original format.

cdata >> wav      And      wav >> cdata

OK !?

It's obviously possible, since the game can play the music, but no one has produced a standalone decoder for it yet, to my knowledge.  I was working on it a few months ago but I didn't finish.  You're welcome to my notes if you want them, you can see our discussion here: [viewtopic.php?f=17&t=4068](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=17&t=4068)
