- Post Title: Help with Converting .rx2 Stadium to .rx3 for FIFA PC

Dear Members,

I'm from the SoccerGaming forums and we are currently trying to edit the first NG version of FIFA on PC, FIFA 11. In my case what I am trying to do is add a couple of new stadiums, or rather missing ones from previous NG version from the XBOX360/PS3. There has been no problems thus far thanks to help from the "quickbms" program, but I am having immense trouble trying to convert a set of three stadium models from FIFA09, which are in .rx2 format. This doesn't suit the regular format now used in FIFA11 which is the .rx3 file type. Any idea on how to convert/decompress this?

If you guys need the files i can upload some of them for you.

This is another uploaded rar with both the X360 and PS3 versions of the Millennium Stadium from FIFA09. The XBOX360 files are .rx2 and the PS3 files are .rpsgl.

Hi guys,

I really need your help with converting one stadium from FIFA09, the Millenium Stadium in Wales. I have found both the PS3 and the XBOX360 versions, but they are both, as of now, uneditable file types, .rpsgl and .rx2 filetypes. How can I convert them to FIFA11 PC's rx3 format?

In this uploaded rar are both the X360 and PS3 versions of the Millennium Stadium from FIFA09. The XBOX360 files are .rx2 and the PS3 files are .rpsgl.

Any Help will be appreciated.
