- Post Title: 4X4 Evo SMF file?

So hey, I want to convert the 4x4 Evo SMF files, I don't really get them. I got the POD extracted and the RAW files were a success (TEXTURE FILE).
But I want the model too. 
Here is a sample: [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1015-0R ... sp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1015-0RfHpNL8kDA8va1M9ukn4HQbAFGa/view?usp=sharing)

I saw a tutorial on importing them into Zmodeler but I want a free way (such as a converter program.)
I want UVs and the model (of course lol)
I also found this Re-Volt mod which has a model from 4x4 Evo.

Edit: I want these files converted to a usable model format (obj) Make the program public of course
btw I use blender

Update: When I open the SMFs in Notepad, it is actually already ASCII.

Oh wow I'm dumb. I forgot in the really old versions of Zmodeler, it was freeware. The really old versions had SMF import, and I got a model successfully.
