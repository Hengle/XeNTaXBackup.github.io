- Post Title: Attack on Titan: Wings of Freedom PS3

Wanting to try to mod AoT: Wings of Freedom, tried one of aluigi's quickbms scripts but get this error. I've included one of the files.

```
       Check your disk space or the script is wrong

Last script line before the error or that produced the error:
  13  log "" OFFSET SIZE

```
