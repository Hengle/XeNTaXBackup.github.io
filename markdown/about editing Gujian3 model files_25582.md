- Post Title: about editing Gujian3 model files

Hello guys!
I have a friend who really,really want to edit this game's character model files,and put them back to the game.
unfortunately,there's no exporter for these models(but an importer is available).
so I wonder if someone in xentax has some spare time,could you please write an exporter for him?
Thx 
Here's the link of some model files and the importer:

Any help will be greatly appreciated!
