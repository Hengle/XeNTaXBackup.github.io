Hi, i'm new here and i want to know exactly how and what tool to use to decrypt a .dat file that the Nintendo Switch version uses? i'm trying to create a mod for the switch release of the game using the +18 CGs & sounds.

Edit: never mind, i've finally figured it out! now my new problem would be the evimage's file format the Switch version uses, ending their extension named ".wida" lemme know if anyone knows how to decrypt that yet and thanks.
