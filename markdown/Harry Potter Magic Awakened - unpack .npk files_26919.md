- Post Title: "Harry Potter Magic Awakened" - unpack .npk files

Hey all!

I was looking for a way to unpack `npk` files for Harry Potter Magic Awakened.

[Link to example NPK files](https://mega.nz/folder/QutVyCYI#QXAvp2v4nsAy4EsfOncYsg)

[Link to the game](https://www.harrypottermagicawakened.com).

Can be downloaded directly (PC version), NPK files in the game folder.
I've tried QuickBMS as well as [viewtopic.php?t=21328](https://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?t=21328) but couldn't figure out how to.

Appreciate any advice.

Please upload some NPK samples to some hosting site like mega.nz or google drive and then share a public link here.
