Hi there!

Did you manage to extract any of the resources yet?
The only thing I got so far are some collision meshes, I attached the one from 9227.DAT (689712 bytes).

Cheers!

Just using JPCSP function of 3d rip, this aviable after R2578, but models in actual poses and textures in psp version too low, ps2 textures more much better, here The Warriors gang pack for GTA SA [http://candykond-sergio.blogspot.ru/201 ... -pack.html](http://candykond-sergio.blogspot.ru/2012/07/warriors-skin-pack.html)

So the PS2 version has better textures and the PSP version has better models?
I assume its more because nobodies figured out ps2 models, and the jpcsp emu has a model dump function

You can use Xpert2 + PS2_The_Warriors_dir_wad.epi - plugin
download here: [http://www.mediafire.com/download/de6qc ... Plugins.7z](http://www.mediafire.com/download/de6qchz05am4iyr/Xpert2_186_Plugins.7z)
how to use it here: [https://web.archive.org/web/20100224053 ... torial.htm](https://web.archive.org/web/20100224053827/http://www.freewebs.com/expert_tool/DVD5_ISO_Shrinker_Tutorial.htm)

Then you can extract textures files from .dat files with "Warriors Texture Exporter" made by nick7(aka lego)
attached
this is only for ps2 version
