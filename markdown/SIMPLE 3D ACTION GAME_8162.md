Could anyone help to decompress that given files in first post of the topic with any third party tool ??

I tried the "gobread.exe" but it fails to extract files from that file type (*.gen), however it was successfully extracting from *.wrs format, what are the differences about these file formats,that these two types from 3dgamestudio resource packaging format ??
