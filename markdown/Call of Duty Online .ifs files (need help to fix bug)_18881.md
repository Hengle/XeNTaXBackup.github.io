- Post Title: Call of Duty Online *.ifs files (need help to fix bug)

I found a tool named Wraith Cyborg to extract *.ifs files.But it has a bug. When two or more files have the same name in the same .ifs file , Wraith Cyborg will overwrite the previous.Unfortunately,I know little about C++,and DTZxPorter won't update it anymmore.

For example,there're 2 files named"UK_1_mp_pain.mp3" in "lf_init_common_mp_1_V29.ifs"

main/sound/voiceovers/codo_mp/tf/m1/UK_1_mp_pain.mp3
main/sound/voiceovers/codo_mp/tf/m2/UK_1_mp_pain.mp3

In the end,only 1 file was extracted.

IFS2.dll:[https://www108.zippyshare.com/v/s7HnoN2G/file.html](https://www108.zippyshare.com/v/s7HnoN2G/file.html)
"lf_init_common_mp_1_V29.ifs":[https://www31.zippyshare.com/v/zRN3BsMp/file.html](https://www31.zippyshare.com/v/zRN3BsMp/file.html)

I can't seem to access zippyshare, but if you post the files elsewhere I can have a look.
