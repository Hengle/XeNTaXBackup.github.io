- Post Title: [PC] The Punisher .vpp files

Dear programmers ...

I come here asking for your help: I'm trying to translate the PC version of The Punisher for Brazilian Portuguese. After doing some research, I discovered that the program could take Game Extractor and place the files.
Well, I started to tinker with the program (Pay), managed to extract the files and view them without problem, edited and put back, but in doing so, I saw that it generated a new file. Vpp much larger than the original, I made a copy the oriigianl, changed the name of the new test and went, the game crashed ...

Therefore, I ask help of any developer interested in helping me in my goals.

Thanks and have a good night!
