- Post Title: Black Desert .wem Files

I've tried it via this Tutorial [viewtopic.php?p=66311&sid=94de722e28428 ... e2f#p66311](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?p=66311&sid=94de722e2842869af2f4141f3bb82e2f#p66311) but it didn't worked.
It always gives me the error: missing RIFF message
Here are 3 samples

Nothing but 00s when looked at in a hex editor. There is no audio data at all from those three files.
