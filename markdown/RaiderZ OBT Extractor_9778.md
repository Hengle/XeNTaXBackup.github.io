- Post Title: RaiderZ OBT Extractor

This is my filesystem extractor for all existing RaiderZ clients (and latest OBT)!

Source code is open to all - see my project on GitHub - [https://github.com/x1nixmzeng/z3ResEx](https://github.com/x1nixmzeng/z3ResEx)

I started my original research in this thread ([viewtopic.php?f=21&t=5899](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=21&t=5899)) for anyone curious   

Attached is the latest build at the time of this post!

Usage:

> z3ResEx.exe [client_path] [-v|l]
>
> 
>
> To begin immediate extraction from the current directory, run from the command line without any arguments:
>
> 
>
> 	z3ResEx.exe
>
> 
>
> Note: fileindex.msf should be in the same directory!
EDIT: April 2nd
Updated to latest Github build which supports the latest GunZ2 and RaiderZ filesystem keys

The latest EU build (37874) has changed keys. Your app says "ERROR: This file is using an updated key or unsupported method" with this build

Thanks. I've updated the key for the latest EU RaiderZ client!

You can download the new attachment on this thread, or over at Github.

Edit

Updated again just now for NA RaiderZ but hasn't uploaded it here yet.
