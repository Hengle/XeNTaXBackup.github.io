- Post Title: Eternal Darkness Audio Formats

I've been browsing through Eternal Darkness ISO, trying to understand the SFXs. BGM can be opened via VGMstream.

the \audio\stream folder files present a structure similar to this, in Hex, as they have no extension:

..CE...+..}.....
.......+........
.........A......
..._.(.....1...c
................
................
c.. ...1..?....
"n...O./!.o_%.r4
q.X@..Y_b...!..%
".?.....Qc0`1.Q.
!C.@..Ua".2"S.B.
a~'.B1.M!...`...
x.....R.h,.v..4.
w. ../.|..cEd .3
v4..;.._W.." ..%
w:.\./.5w...B.L.
'.A.3.........q.
UF..B=..F.......
v.Q...K.62.A..2.

\Autopsy files are .aud files that vgm stream CANNOT play.

the \effects folder has .poo, .pro, .sam., .sdi
those are very much possibly archives.
