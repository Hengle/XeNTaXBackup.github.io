I just got the japanese version of shin megami tensei persona 4 as a gift...HOLY COW!

enjoy hearing japanese...also, I didn't edit the video, it's TV screen-like up to 0:40 which is relevant to the game
and no I cannot speak japanese and yes, the only reason I got this was just the I wanted to have it 
PERSONA!



Persona 3 FES FTW!!!!

Heh, you should know I'm a heavy Megaten fan myself. 

I'm looking forward to the new Devil Summoner title as well.

it's supposed to be out in japan (at least i think, i read about it some time ago, lots of good new stuff like 2 demons at a time, conversation with demons, many more demons, skills and such)
it'll probalby come outside japan sometime in 2009 if we're lucky

and the latest expansion to smt3: nocturne, the "chronicles" edition or something, has raidou in the place of dante, i don't know anything else about it though...

which means this'll be replaced by a scene in which both the characters are silent...yeah...
i bet the only ones that would talk in the scene are the pixie from the hospital in the beginning of the game (if you have it with you) and the cat...whatever name it had

just make an aeriagames account, log in and sign up for beta

i didn't even had to lie, i just said that i had never played an aeriagames game before, only that i had played an smt game before and they took me anyway...

well after you apply for beta testing wait 5-6 days or so and they'll most likely email you telling you that they accept or that they don't, i don't really know what happens if they don't accept you...

as for the games in the megaten series, yes, they are quite hard to find in greece, too, i had to buy digital devil saga 2 from an online shop in greece and about the others...don't ask, seriously those games were harder to find than a video club that has all the .hack ps2 games...i had to go to 3 different ones since one had only part 1 and 4, the other had part 3 and the other part 2...what a nuisance that was...

but when persona 4 comes out in europe, i'll be the first to buy it, seriously
