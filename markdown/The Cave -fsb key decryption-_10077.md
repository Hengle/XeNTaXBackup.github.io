- Post Title: The Cave -fsb key decryption-

Here is:
DFm3t4lFTW

Anyway the game checks data, so you can't replace the audios.

Wth..is the same password i found in the README.TXT from guessfsb 0.3 

> Example with text key:
>
> decfsb Music_P1_100.fsb Music.fsb "DFm3t4lFTW"

Funny  

I tried to encrypt using decfsb.exe but i get no sounds, you can try with the file MusicStream_Intro.fsb, it's the first music.
