Anyone knows how to view *.X file in binary form? Or convert it to some other viewable format?

Thank you Jasmine. 

It is very encouraging that I have already ventured there where you suggested , but still no solutions as :

> The .X File format can be either in plain text or in binary. This is given in the header of the file. We will look into the text format. The binary format will be addressed in the fifth chapter.
Where is that 5th chapter? 

Anyway, meanwhile I found some other links which made me go here:

[http://www.programmersheaven.com/2/FAQ- ... re-X-Files](http://www.programmersheaven.com/2/FAQ-DIRECTX-What-Are-X-Files)
and then search for conv3ds.exe led me somwhere else where I had to download  MS NET. And still not there yet. Pretty convoluted this binary directX format.

Or U could get Deep Exploration they have a free demo that views .x files 
and a lot of other formats and u can convert them to anything u like

Actually I have used all known to me viewers and converters to read this file. Deep Exploartion was on the list in the 1st ten   

But here I have attached a link to download the file I extracted with the original mrf. As you will easily see (under the Hex Editor examination) on the begining of the original file is the total number of models contained (29) , then is the sequential model number which BARN1 is the #9 , then the offset of the start of #9 (316) and then total lenght of the file (7142).  And then the story repeats for the other file (BARN2). 

Thanks to this finding I came to see that the Mark ID of the file is "xof"which made me think that we have here X file.  Well, at least thanks to association with this group this is how "clever"   I became. Using hex editor I extracted the file from mrf, saved as X, and tried to view it as binary X. But that was end of my success and joy, as the file is stubborn and does not want display in any X file viewer. 


Looking at the file below please verify all the above and try to see if perhaps I am not making some dumb error somewhere. Thnx.

No ....c'mon... not a chance.
Go to bottom of the link and press button FREE. It will open another page where you just need to enter the 3 letter code displayed in color. This will get you to the file. The system is quite good for sharing even large files.

I guess that IS what I really, really, really, really have meant   

BTW there is one pretty decent flight simulation called Strike Fighters:Project 1 where all that DiectX graphics technology is out on the open to experiment, learn and have fun while doing this. There are not so many games where all files are wide open and even translated to text format for the various parameters to be entered easily and thereafter immediately tested in the game right in front of your eyes. That game has it all just that way.

The X file I have extracted and unsucessfully examined was in binary format. Is there any binary to text translator for X files? Perhaps looking at content of the file in text format gives me more chance to see what could be wrong there.
Cheers.

In the DirectX SDK Extras 
[http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/deta ... ayLang=en]](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?%5DFamilyID=ec97a1fb-4305-4758-b7c4-5a12b3fe8ec2&DisplayLang=en%5D)

I have found some utilities which convert DirectX files. One of the utility is called ConvXof , which is suppose able to convert xof file to x file giving text output. 

However,....   , I need to make sure that I extract xof files right from 
*. mrf file (link in initial post of this thread). I am using Strobes Tool Jaeder Naub V1.9.0t to extract them. Despite that the file looks very simple and I can visually see various start/stop offsets of XOF models, it does not want to work. It only is extracting one singlr file. 

Can anyone take a look and try to help?

Hi, thatnks for interest . Here is new link. 
[http://rapidshare.de/files/37258731/mdls.zip.html](http://rapidshare.de/files/37258731/mdls.zip.html)

And added help perhaps....
I have acquired a plug in to export 3ds to X format in three versions:
text, binary and compressed binary.  So now we could have perhaps something to compare with what is packed in the file. Just remember that in the file there are several (26) models bunched together . But thats easy - the road map what is where on the begining of the file. 

Let me know if we need to generate some X models for comparison which I will do anyway.

No it is not Xbox file . It is for PC tank simulation Steel Beasts. 

The file I enclosed for download is a bin or pack file containing several models. 

1st is the 4 byte header with above number 26 indicating how many models the file contains 

> 1a 00 00 00

then there is 26 position listing of where the files are in (Little Endian order) :
1st dword has the seq # of model 
2nd has the starting offset 
3rd the length of the file

So the first model is #9 and starting at offset 316 dec and is having length of 7142 bytes.  

Let us go there - first model is called Barn1 and is simple shape of a most basic house with slanted both ways roof. 
Each file starts like this" xof 0302bin 0032". They are binary but not as I believe compressed.   The structure of the file is 2 part : undamagad and damaged. 

Only this far I know.   

My objective is to find the way to edit those files in binary form and if not  possible seek the way to substitute them with new models made and moded by user.

but I'm trying to find some sort of flag that will tell me the order of the bytes

Problem is that without knowing the header I can't open all the data for the
model wihtout much work.

I already have something that could be a barn with a slanted roof but untill I figure out the header I can't trust the data(just vertecies atm)

do you have a picture of the barn? I want to know if I'm not seeing things :P

Edit: I just found a page with the specifications of the X file format :)

Here is the picture. It is very basic and simplistic 3D and graphics, however, the simulation is deep as the ocean.   
Also the next model barn2 is even simplier model without that top roof on the chimney or vent. 



Can *.X binary 3D files be translated to text format ? I could not honestly find too much about it. The only stuff I found is listed and linked in previous posts on top.

Anything new here? How your visualisation of shape conforms the reality?
I could perhaps build this form and convert to *.X text binary and binary compressed. Just to see what could be further done with them. 

Anyone knows what is the meaning of "frames" for *.X format? 

I remember one program for Operation Flash Point (OFP) which was "debinarizator" (if thats the word   ) for their models. Got to look somwhere for it.

progress! Xela progress!

problem was the data was offset by one byte so it's not big endian

Frames are keyframes I guess, it is a way of stop motion animation*
the computer interpolates within frames to make it look smooth

*put a model in one position, take picture, move model - take picture
etc etc

- btw, do you know how the playstation 2 displays paletters? I this pictures and I can't get the palette right.. I use an unsigned byte for counting and all yet the color is like offset by one.. I don't get it

I see that the shape is definetely conforming the model so you are on the right track. 
It is not Playstaion though , but PC game. Palette of the model is ??? the material is textured material. The texture name is Barn1.bmp.

I wonder what happened to the destroyed part of this house?. As you can see on my shot on the very bottom of the buiding is what you can all "pancaked" house. On the Hex display of the binary file I see clearly where the "good" model ends and "destroyed" begins. The are in the same file from what I can see. 

Can you perhaps control vertex locations and position with Hex Editor. I would surely would love to exchange this model for something more elaborate and insert that into mrf file , but for now even simple modification would do too. 

Good work

that was king of off topic, I was refering to the palette of biohazard.Makai kingdom.

I downloaded the demo to see if could locate the barn.
I didn't know how to stop the tank and understood what the "flat barn" was all about and that is why I didn't load it

you can technicaly edit it in hex, the only thing you need to do is swap x and y when you dump your floats into a file... but that is complicated if you ask me

after "barn" there is 0A00 this ends the string, six bytes from here lies the
number of vertecies 8400 0000, an integer(32bits) right now it's 138, your going ot need to replace this to match the new vertecies or better yet, don't change the quantity of vertecies and just mod them right as they are on the file

vertex = float x, y ,z;  repeats 138 times
CCC2 67C2 1433 4642 23BB 76C2 this is the first vertex of the barn

........ oh... you ment me >.>... I could and was going to but hte demo seems to have a protection against this

in what format can you export your new model? in order to code and importer I need to know both formats

Beautifull finds, thank you for help. 
I can export in any format . In *.X too , but .3ds or .ASC would be good too. Perhaps *. X would be the most compatible. For that I use PandaX Exporter plugin for 3dStudioMax. 

That 84 00 00 00 integer is 132 but we are talking the same thing. I see string of floats. So for now I can do that simple float value changes in order to reshape the model. Great

ASE!

it should be one of the standard exports for 3dsmax

My ASE importer isn't fully functinal right now, it only reads vertex array, indices and normals(not UV) but adding the rest should be no problem

I have 3dsMax all right , and all perhaps possible 3D converters there are there. But since I do not really care so much about importing the models as much as I am after the procedure to substitute *.X models with new ones and perhaps adding new models to mrf. 
That is my ultimate target and goal!

Yes :) but remember that you need to know the correct scale and position of the model :) hence, you need the original as reference :P


btw.. did yo ever try cutting one of the models in the archive and save it to it's own file? does the importer still not work?

as I understand, to add new models you are going to need to "call" this new models in a map file, other wise they just take up space :P

It is in fact only exporter and not importer. As strange as it may sound I frankly I do not know any  importer  for *.X in binary form. Does anyone ? 

As far as "calling models on the  "map" you are right. They all have code vname and that is how they are called from mrf file to the terrain map. I am researching this apect and have some preliminary findings. 

So for now , the time being, just simple substitution of model in mrf should be OK too. Let us say instead of barn we place something else. Even just changing the shape of the bran to accomodate geographical changes ... an igloo for example   would be welcomed. 

I think that I should do just that. Make the spredsheet list of files , their starting offsets and length. 
Then make and add new X binary model in max and export it. Place new file in mrf by pasting. Change the offsets and see if it works.  
Should it not

Here I separated that BARN file from the rest and kind of dissected onto the parts with /////"My description what is in this part of file"
Sorry for the little mumble looking post and it is of no particular use just to show what binary X file is structured and what parts to expect:

I am back to this topic trying to identify the coordinates of the vertexes from those floats found in the file. At this stage I shall be satisfied if I could to manipulate shape by just changing the float values with hex editor.  This process perhas could be made faster if the list of vertices or rather their coordinates,  used to make your model , Alera, were published. 

Or perhaps there might be another way to quickly translate them to 3D model?

Iâ€™m SO sorry for being away for so long. 
The problems I was having with my electrical service became so bad that I had to leave  my computer off for about a week until I could buy a ups. He he ^_^ and even then the ups could not hold more than 16 seconds with the PC alone(idle). My system crashed(couldnâ€™t boot) during that particular test and I had some data lost(poor me :P).

To top it off, my isp decided that it would remove my internet service for an â€œunspecified amount of timeâ€

Lots to study, but after reading and analysing that more carefully and methodically than I am able just right now. 
Thanks Alera for coming back to this project. 

My first comment: the mrf file from we have this Barn model contain more of them - 26 to be exact as the header of the file says. 
The begining of the file :

lists number of models, size and offset where the file starts. It is like "road map" or directory of entire *.mrf file. Then after that the 1st model starts at offset 316.  The 1st model is model #9 (just to complicate things a little   ) and it is called BARN1 , it is 7142 bytes in size and ends before offset 7458 where BARN2 model begins. 

I know that you know that very well, I just wanted to point that this listing of the models, sizes and offsets on the begining refers to all models in mrf and is NOT part of the model file BARN1. 

To my thinking all I had to do is separate models according to offsets, name them "model_such_and_such.X" and run them through some known *.X file editors , Blender being one of them. So far unsuccessful. 

More comments to follow....

anyone able to extract the directx model from the mrf packages? there's viewers for those available now, you could as a last resort rip models out of the viewer once you get them out of the package.
