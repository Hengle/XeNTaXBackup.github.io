- Post Title: AION Online or Shaiya Online Animated Model Importers

Hello Everyone,

I tried all of the importers to get AION or Shaiya online models with animations, but no luck .

I exported all Shaiya content and Opened with Neosis and can't get animations (i think script isn't working with animations)
I tried to AION script at here: [viewtopic.php?f=16&t=3999&hilit=cgf&start=30](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=3999&hilit=cgf&start=30) But kept getting error about its not an aion model, (file headers are different, I Attached.) 

and while Unpacking .pak file from aion with RPGExtractor, animation files doesn't contain any data (0 Kb.)

Does anyone can help me? 

I just need a customizable wizard model (male, female with 4/6 armor/face/hair variation) to prototype my game, and move on my coding.

Thanks a lot.
