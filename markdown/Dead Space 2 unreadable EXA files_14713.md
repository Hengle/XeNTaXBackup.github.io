- Post Title: Dead Space 2 unreadable EXA files

I got few unreadable exa files I cannot open with ealayer3, because either they are corrupted or are made with different type of encoding unlike the others.

I'm suspecting this sound effect: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sm4v41p8Oqk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sm4v41p8Oqk) is one of them, which is why I'm asking for someone figure this out.

Thanks!
