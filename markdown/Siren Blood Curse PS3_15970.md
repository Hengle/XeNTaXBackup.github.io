Hey guys! I realise this is an older game, but I recently replayed it and was kinda taken back by how well made it was and how great the models looked. I did a bit of diving around and found a couple of scripts from Chrrox and mariokartn64 from YEARS ago, and managed to get the models extracted and loaded into 3DS Max as statics, but there's something wrong in the UV translation and being useless at scripting and anything really beyond using tools I figured I'd see if anyone could make heads or tails of these. The skeleton system is included, and it's HAVOK (tried using Volfin's HKX to SMD converter but to no avail).

Anyone care to have a look? Here's a link to the OG thread: [viewtopic.php?f=10&t=5458&start=15](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=5458&start=15)

And here's a link to a sample model, with textures and related data I extracted... [https://mega.nz/#!SQ4DGZBZ!qg_6bea9fDUD ... TcrIsETxbM](https://mega.nz/#!SQ4DGZBZ!qg_6bea9fDUDRTHzbit1AvntW8PuN3lX0TcrIsETxbM)

Any help would be tremendously appreciated!
