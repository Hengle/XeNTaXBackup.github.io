- Post Title: Rohan online Gmf convertor/blender script

Hi Guys, I have been searching for too long for a tool to open Rohan online models in Blender, 3ds, maya etc but could not find anything.

I did come across something on ProGamerCity, [http://www.progamercity.net/game-gfx/15 ... cript.html](http://www.progamercity.net/game-gfx/1589-release-rohan-extractor-blender-script.html)

But apparently that forum is completely dead, I have made few helpful guide threads, etc, I got no reply whether my account is denied or approved, all posts are very old and is inactive.

I hope I will find something here!

(Well, don't know how they define "active".)

> I hope I will find something here!There is code to extract .GEL and .GEM files but the blender script by Szkaradek123 I can't find here.

Oh yea, apparently its been deleted before I could even get to it.... 

Also, I support this forum because I donated so I have access to that.


I hope some one will help me someday XD!
