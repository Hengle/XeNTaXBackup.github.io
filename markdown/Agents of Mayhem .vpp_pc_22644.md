       Can't read 465181 bytes from offset 00000000202a4903.
       Anyway don't worry, it's possible that the BMS script has been written
       to exit in this way if it's reached the end of the archive so check it
       or contact its author or verify that all the files have been extracted.
       Please check the following coverage information to know if it's ok.

  coverage file 0    99%   539176974  539642115  . offset 00000000202a4903

Last script line before the error or that produced the error:
  18  clog memory_file1 BASE_OFF ZSIZE SIZE

Press ENTER or close the window to quit
```
