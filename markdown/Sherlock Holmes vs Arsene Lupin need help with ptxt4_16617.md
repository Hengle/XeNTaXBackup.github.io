You must select the original file and the directory is where your edited stuff are. Click make a.pak file, then you select the proper stuff for your file. There is also instucrions if you click on ?

O yea I totally forgot for that. Here's the full tool it was in my recycle bin in mega. Just use pak_extr.exe. It can replace in the files. Sorry about that. I guess I've not uploaded the whole thing.

Awesome, thx for toolpack.   

Is it normal that I can't "make .pak"? I know I'm tiring you, but I really care what I do. And you are the only man who dealt with all this and still "exist" on the internet.

Mby Bacter intended to make it a option for next updates but he stopped for some reason. I didn't saw it either so idk. You don't need it anyway cuz you replace the files in the original archive.
