- Post Title: Dark Sector lwo.1/png.1/skel.x.1

Hi everyone!

I've just gotten the 2008 game Dark Sector. It looks like it's got some great models in it. I've used the bms script to unpack the contents and it appears the textures are unpacked as ______.png.1 with models being either ____.lwo.1 and/or ______.skel.x.1

I've looked at the lwo.1 in a hex editor and noticed "nxs.mesh" as a potential header. I've also tried removing the "1" from the files and opening them as normal png and lwo files but with no luck. 

Does anyone have any insight on what to do with these files? PM me if you want more info.
