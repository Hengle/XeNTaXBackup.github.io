- Post Title: The longest journey translating

Hello,

I would like to translate this great adventure game from Funcom, but i need to edit the XARC/XRC files with the subtitles. I used the TLJView program ([http://oezmen.eu/gameresources/](http://oezmen.eu/gameresources/)) to view and extract them, but it doesn't edit the files.

someone can help me? i don't know what to do now. I researched a lot and I have not found anything that works.

thank you
