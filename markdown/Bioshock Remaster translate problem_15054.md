- Post Title: Bioshock Remaster translate problem

Hello, I wanted to move the files from my language to the new version remaster. It worked only partially.  Instead, Polish special characters are squares, probably due to the fact that no suitable font. Does anyone know where in bioshock 1 is a font and how to extract this file? Whether it comes to file ShockGame.U?

The BioShock Remastered using Adobe Flash fonts. Font file is "fonts.swf" and "sharedlibrary.swf" in "ContentBaked\pc\FlashMovies".
If you want edit a fonts, you need Adobe Flash decompiler.

Ok but this are polish files from Bioshock 1 and is not there font file. So I do not know if these two files depend on the showing of these squares.

It is a system files from Polish translation from Bioshock 1.

Sorry, my mistake. "sharedlibrary.swf" is subtitles fonts in BioShock 2 Remasterd. BioShock Remasterd subtitles fonts file is "fonts.swf".

I don't know about GSC files. But I don't think need a edit GSC files. 'Cause I was display fonts successful without edit GSC files.


Before edit "fonts.swf".


After only edit "fonts.swf".
See?

First, launch the JPEXS Free Flash Decompiler. And open a fonts file.

IF FONT IS INSTALLED:

1. Select a font what you want add.
2. Input a characters what you want add in "Add characters".
3. Press "OK".

IF FONT IS NOT INSTALLED:

1. Press "Embed".
2. Select "TTF file" or press the icon on the right side.
3. Select a font what you want add. (Font file what you want select must be TTF format.)
4. Input a characters what you want add in "Individual characters".
5. Press "OK".

Have you been waiting for a long time, huh? Sorry to late.
Menu fonts file is "pausePC.swf". If you want always display characters what you want on the game correctly, you must edit Adobe Flash files all.
I don't know why that characters overlapped.

Long time no see, guys.
I had analyze about the fonts. As a result: Don't edit all Adobe Flash files. Just edit files "fonts.swf" and "pausePC.swf" only.
Don't edit "sharedlibrary.swf". If you guys edit that file, Latin characters will be weird.
