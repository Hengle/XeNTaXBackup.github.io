- Post Title: Arkham Asylum Audio Extraction Problem

There is a certain RFMODSOUND file in the Arkham Asylum files that won't work properly. I use fsbii to turn it into fsb, then I use fsb_mpeg to turn it into mp3. However, unlike most, these mp3 files are 0 bytes and will not play. What do I do?

That's because they are not mp3 files, but ADPCM. MusicPlayerEx can play and extract them. Maybe some other tools, I don't know.
