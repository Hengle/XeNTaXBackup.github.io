- Post Title: God Eater 3 Ripping - issues with Face models

Alright, so I've been scouring the internet for solutions to all this with absolutely 0 results. I don't know what else to do besides ask about it here.

I've managed to get MOST God Eater 3 models working OK in Noesis using this python plugin here: [viewtopic.php?f=16&t=17834&start=15#p148419](https://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=17834&start=15#p148419)

However, all of the faces for the characters do NOT work at all.
When I both try to preview OR export them, I receive the following error:



I really don't know what to do with the script, as I'm not savvy in python coding (or coding of any kind, really.)

NinjaRipper or similar I am not down for, as no armatures get extracted. Would anybody be able to assist me?
