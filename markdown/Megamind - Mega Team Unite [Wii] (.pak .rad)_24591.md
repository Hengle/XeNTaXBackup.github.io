The pak file is definetly an archive file. I have 80% of the file format cracked, i need to make a tool out of that so give me some more time. It's actually an pretty easy and straight forward file format, with zlib compression. I will post updates soon...

About that rad format i haven't looked at it yet...

i cannot find any info about the gml format, however .rcb is a dead space format? I don't have 3ds max and I'm unsure if it even works for that script.
