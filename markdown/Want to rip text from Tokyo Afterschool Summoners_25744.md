- Post Title: Want to rip text from Tokyo Afterschool Summoners

Is there a way to rip the game text or the text script from the .apk file? Upon extracting the .apk file there are a lot of files inside including .assets unity files. Could someone please guide me as to the process? I would really appreciate it.

I want to rip the text so I can compile a vocabulary frequency list of the most frequently occurring Japanese words so I can make an Anki deck from that, learn them, and then enjoy the visual novel properly. The game does have several language options so it might be stored on different files. However only the Japanese version is complete and spans the entire course of the game's plot.
