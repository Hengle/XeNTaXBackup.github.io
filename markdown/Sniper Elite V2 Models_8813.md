- Post Title: Sniper Elite V2 Models

Recently the demo version of Sniper Elite V2 has been released. I went in the files to see how they made the package and I found a .asr or .PC files.

I used this tool to open and extract them : [http://www.terrybutler.co.uk/tools/asur ... extractor/](http://www.terrybutler.co.uk/tools/asura-engine-extractor/)

It exports the textures and the sounds perfectly ( texture need a change from TGA to DDS to work. like changing the extension) but the models are strange. They don't have an extension at all and I don't know which format they use. 

I would like to know if it's possible for someone to make an import script for 3ds max 9 for the models.  They are pretty much high quality.

Well for the textures, you need to use the converter and the blob.PC_TEXTURES, then you need to change the format from .tga to .dds then it will work. Some textures are 0kb. You need to rexexport them manually from the extractor. Also for the models you need to use QuickBMS with a script, then you need Noesis with AVP plugin but that's where it doesn't work. AVP plugin doesn't support Sniper Elite V2 model version. Here is the thread : [http://facepunch.com/threads/1079779?highlight=](http://facepunch.com/threads/1079779?highlight=)
