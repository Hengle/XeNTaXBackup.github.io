Hi, 

For my first topic, I would like to thank you for  this software which is very interesting to me.
Indeed, I would like to create a french (I'm french) database of all the items available in TERA Online.

So I was thinking to find the list of all the items and their specs in this file.

I've download your software, launch it. but I've some issue whith the decompressed file.
I give you a screen.

[http://hpics.li/8688f61](http://hpics.li/8688f61)

I would like to know if you can help me to find a way to export all the items (with characteristics) with your TDCDec software ?
Or can you explain to me what I'm wrong when I use your software.

Thanks.
Good evening.

you can't read data from decompressed/decrypted dat, Ekey tool only decrypt/decompress the file format, not the data!
ps: A lot of ppl want a tool for read dat, but no body work on it, only 2/3 dev's, all other wait for leech works without a thanks.

Hi, 

thanks for your quick answer SheppeR.
So ok, I understand what you are saying. Actually I can not find a tool to read the content of .dat files. I'm interested to learn how I can read .dat file. But before that I have 2 questions: 

-For my project: Create an online database for all the item in TERA (name + characteristics in french). Is it necessary to read .dat file ? Where can I find informations about TERA's items?

-If I have to learn how I can read .dat file, can you give me some informations ? (what tools I have to use ? Some tutorials maybe ? anything else).

Thank you.
