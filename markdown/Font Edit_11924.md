Use Adobe Photoshop with [this](https://developer.nvidia.com/nvidia-texture-tools-adobe-photoshop) plugin. This should make editing easier.

Someone else recommended XnView. Save as png with XnView, edit png with any program, then save it as dds with XnView. They said it worked for Sniper Elite 2.

Use XnView, as written above. But may have a program for creating your fonts. I wish I knew how to look completely your fonts along with the coordinates.
