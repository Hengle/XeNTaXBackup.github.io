Just import nif files in blender or max with the right pluginfor gamebryo format. You can find it easily since it s open to the public. Then from max or blender export them as fbx ( i sugest 1 fbx for skeletal mesh and multiple fbx with just 1 animatiom for file)

I didn t use blender for nif files so I can not suggest you what to do. 
But i think that is a skeletal mesh ( weapon) with a animation in the .nif files itself. 
Normally .nif are skeletal or statis meshes and .kf are animation files ( look into the folder if you got .kf files for that mesh). 
If you have 3d studio max load it there or otherwise try noesis ( should work with that version on .nif; and support several abimation format export options ).

I remember skeletal mesh with simple animation inside the .nif file should work with 3dstudio max plugin
