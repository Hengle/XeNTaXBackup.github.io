- Post Title: MultiEx sort by file type?

Does MultiEx have option to sort the list view by file type?  How about option to extract only certain file types?

The first : no. 

The second: load up an archive, go to Edit, select the type in the Search dialog and those files will be selected. Now extract.

Perhaps various sort methods for the result list could be a future feature, then...
