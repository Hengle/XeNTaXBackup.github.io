- Post Title: Star Fox Assault (GameCube)

I was trying to get the models from Star fox Assault (by Namco and Nintendo). A member of this site called Viperzerof-2, a friend of mine tried to help me and was able to extract the files but not opened them. He said that the models files were likely the .CBD files in the SE folder.

I have everything he sent me
