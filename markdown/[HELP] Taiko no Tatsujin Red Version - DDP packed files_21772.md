- Post Title: [HELP] Taiko no Tatsujin Red Version - DDP packed files

I'm trying to extract some textures from Taiko no Tatsujin Red Version, most of the are in .nut format, that i can open with some smash tools.
But some files are packed in a single .ddp file, and there's a .txt file that indicates the files inside the pack

It's possible to make a script to unpack this file?

Here i's a example:

Make sure the txt list is in the same path.
