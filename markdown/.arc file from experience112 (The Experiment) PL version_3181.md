- Post Title: .arc file from experience112 (The Experiment) PL version

I need to unpack .arc file from this game. English version has an extractor, see this topic: [viewtopic.php?f=10&t=2939&st=0&sk=t&sd=a](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=2939&st=0&sk=t&sd=a), but translated version has different encryption method. Sample .arc file and system.dll are here to download: [http://uploaded.to/?id=1z2r7l](http://uploaded.to/?id=1z2r7l). Binary XOR-ing it, like Rheini pointed in above topic, doesn't give proper result.
