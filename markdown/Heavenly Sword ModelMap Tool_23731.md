- Post Title: Heavenly Sword Model/Map Tool

Tool for previewing/exporting models and maps from Heavenly Sword. It should be able to handle most of the model files you throw at it. Supports geometry/skinning/materials.

Example exported character


Example map previews

How to use

Unpack

Normally the wad archives have hashes as names, but luckily I managed to find the original names in the game files. You can extract the wads with proper structure using "HSUnpack.exe" that is included in the download. The model stuff is in content_neutral\levels. The unpack tool will work with ch1 - 6 + purgatory levels. Drag and drop any wad file from these level folders and the tool will do the rest. No matter which wad you drag, all of the wads will be exported. So, make sure all the wads for that level are in the same folder and do not change their original names.

Important: For the best result when loading models try not to change the folder/file names and extensions, because some features depend on it. You can delete stuff, but leave the folder structure as it is exported by the tool.

Models

Load

Chunk: Loads a chunk file which contains a single model. There may be some chunks without model data.
Export

NUX: Exports the model to a custom binary format (.nux), intended to be loaded by Noesis. Noesis script for this format : NUX Script
Textures: Exports the textures in PNG format.
Note : Models and textures will be exported into the folder Export.
Maps

Maps are actually just a collection of chunks. I added an option to load multiple chunks at once into the scene. There is also free camera when a map is loaded. You can navigate with WASD and use shift for going faster.

Load Map option will let you choose a folder and load all the chunks in it. It will also go through subdirectories. So, if you want the whole map for example you can select the resources folder which will contain all map related models. Or you can select some subfolders inside resources to load the map in smaller sections.

Export OBJ option will be available once you load a map. It will have material references but only diffuse and normal textures will be mapped. Most 3D software should be able to load this format, but I recommend Blender personally.

Note: Loading and exporting maps can take some time.

the Heavenly Sword is the sole target of the invading armies led by a relentlessly evil warlord named Bohan. It seems he will stop at nothing to capture the sword, thereby consolidating his power as the unquestioned ruler of all of the surrounding clans.
