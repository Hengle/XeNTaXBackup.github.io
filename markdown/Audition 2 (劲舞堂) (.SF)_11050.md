Are the files really nif?? I just opened some nif models in Noesis and they seem to be icons and the stages, not the character models.

Yep, that's the format, and also, inside the pet folder, there are some 3ds max files.

Hi! I found some file (.exe) for packing the patch files into based .sf game files.
In the link below have the PackingHandler file (I get this from the patch), with some .sf file.

Link of the "PackingHandler":[Mega.co.nz](https://mega.co.nz/#!YEcA2J5I!t7KsVSvSKdCZ4BCKqHm6mD8BPdSNQ2_tEWQ3Xf2zAIY)

The "PackingHandler" encrypt the .sf patch file (to check the .sf patch file and to get information for patching ) and put that into based game .sf file.

Can you see, what you can a do with that?
Please try to create packer for this game.

Thanks, I see you used Pascal and C++? 
The C++ is the lib and Pascal is the based.

Hmm, you compiled that project in Ubuntu/Linux system?
