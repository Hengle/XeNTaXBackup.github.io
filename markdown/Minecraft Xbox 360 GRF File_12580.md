- Post Title: Minecraft Xbox 360 GRF File

I have a file from the 360 version of minecraft that is used in the tutorial world. It is what generates the different structures in the tutorial world and allows for custom spawns and messages. The problem is that this file is compressed with a unique format that I cannot decompress and cannot find anyone else who can that is willing to share. There is one person that has decompressed it but he refuses to let anyone else have access to it. If anyone could help me or lead me in the right direction for decompressing this file it would be greatly appreciated. There are a variety of phrases that I know are used in this file. I don't know if it helps with decompression but I will tell you them anyway. 

MapOptions
ApplySchematic
GenerateStructure
GenerateBox
PlaceBlock
PlaceContainer
PlaceSpawner
AddItem
AddEnchantment
enchantmentId
enchantmentLevel
itemId
quantity
food
health
filename

Thanks for the help.
