- Post Title: open .BRE file (modern combat .GLA2 after extract) as zip?

I use Quickbms to extract .GLA2 file in game Modern combat 5, get some .BRE file. I read to open .bre , use hex2obj? I thing here not a right open. .File .obj is only 3d model file. So where is all binary file: script code, animation file, movie file in that .gla2 file? not only 3d model. it must open as zip. Any idea? Cheer!!
