- Post Title: Hex Workshop and Win8.1

I would like to download trial version of this program, but on downloading site is writing that it is not compatible with 8.1.

Is that true? How does it look?

Hi Mkbewe, I have used Hex Workshop on Windows 8.1 and Windows 10, it has worked perfectly for me. I can't say for sure, but I would hope that your experience would be quite similar to mine. I have not found any issues that I can blame the OS for, it has worked as expected. I hope that helps. I suspect the lack of official support is if you were to purchase it and run into problems due to your OS, they might not help with it.

So if the trial runs smooth then you shouldn't have anything to worry about. Hope it helps.
