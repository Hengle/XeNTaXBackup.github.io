Hi folks, sorry to be a newb about this but I wasn't able to find the archive extractor at that link. Is it still there? Also, when I use the Zera Launcher that chrrox posted, I get a "host has failed to respond" error. Does the launcher still work for you? If not, are you willling to share the archives?

OK, I'm sorry for bothering you guys, but I'm kinda lost...

I tried finding Zera Online, but cannot find the full client, only the small archive chrrox uploaded.

Secondly, I am unable to find the unpacker for the game in the other link posted by chrrox, the site is in Asian, but even with my limited reading I was unable to find anything related to Zera.

Am I missing something? Could someone help me out please? I'm sure it's all right infront of me, but I'm just blind or something...

Thanks in advance, Ace.

hi ace!

problem:

Zera online has been discontinued so you will not find client any more

solution:

mr pixel has the client already installed and has 2 archives containing models, char.nar and object.nar. They are online on filefront

That chines page has nartool somewhere on first page, just download that

Thanks everyone for the help. I did a search for Zera, object.nar, and char.nar on filefront with no luck. Does anyone have the specific link to those files?

Can you recall how big the file was? I was able to find only 2 files with Char in them, and they were both around 10MB...

Can anyone share char.nar file again?

zera is discontinued.

filefront is gone.

I've searched everywhere but could not find a way to get char.nar again.
