I'm using the Director's Cut version, but as far as I understand, everything else should be the same aside from the files from the Missing Link.

I tried using this tool [viewtopic.php?f=16&t=10765](https://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=10765) to open the BIGFILES, but I couldn't get the SMC files to open on Blender. As I understand, I need(?) Blender 2.49 to run the script...? Importing it as a plug-in on Blender 2.9 doesn't seem to do anything, and running it as a script just throws an error (but doesn't say what the error is, the console is blank). The OBJ and DDS files work in Blender, but it seems that the texture files are all over the folders and instructions on how look for them aren't clear.

I also tried Gibbed's CrystalDynamics tools [https://github.com/gibbed/Gibbed.CrystalDynamics](https://github.com/gibbed/Gibbed.CrystalDynamics) and I got as far as getting a bunch of DRM files. I can view the textures using DRMEdit, but nothing else. 

Am I missing something, or have the models for DXHR never been ripped...?
