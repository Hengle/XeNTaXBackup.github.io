Naaaaah. I didnt test them throughly, i didnt scan for seeing
how fast they can rip a full blown archive with 1000 of files,
that specific test was to test raw scanner speed =D

I will however make real specific test on a 200mb archive or something
with alot of gfx/audi files in it, too measure Scanning/Detection/Falserips/Saving Speed.

And after that, we will know the hard truth!! 

Edit:
as it should be noted that FileStripper for instance will dump
a file very quickly once it finds one, and therefore increases drastically
in ripping speed.

if someone has a testarchive too send me which i should make those tests
on, then feel free to set up a link too one 

preferably with BMPs, JPEGS, WAVS, Oggs, or anything that is
to be "standard detection" by most rippers.

Edit2:
But yes, im eternally happy that i did rewrite my scanning core,
or else this test would have looked alot different =P

Hmm... based on your test, I'd say Jaeder Naub performs with the best of them, and it's only helped by the fact that it has support for so many formats...

As for GFE, I remember asking the author if I could have the source to it a few months back, seeing as how he discontinued work on it and all, but I never got a reply back. If I ever do, though, I'll certainly send you the source to learn off of his ripper if you want (and assuming the author lets me)!

I guess the source of another ripper could be of interest!

But i can say that my new scanner performs on about 100-200MBs
with only 5 formats enabled in the main engine 

but currently everything is set to On by default.
the only filtering process is done after the actual scan is complete ;D

But, still a source of another engine is always good for educational purposes !

(the reason i dont set On/Off on stuff in the main scanner is because that would actually take the same amount of processing power to jump over
the scanner value as processing it, funny, but thats the way it is currently  )

as a sidenote, ive started to asm optimize it now, just too tweak it as far as it possible to go ......

All right, I'll see if I can't get ahold of that source for you...  

Good luck with the optimizing!

I found another fileripper for you to test... [BitmapRip v1.08](http://mark0.net/soft-bitmaprip-e.html), from the same gent who brought us that glorious file identification tool, TrID.

Too bad unlike the TrID tool it isn't extendable. Jaeder Naub is with it's custom plugin support of which I'm trying to figure out for a few formats that I intend to test.

Yeha, I'd have to agree with you there... I think Mark0 originally designed it just to extract one filetype, he probably isn't focused enough on it to make it externally expandable...

Dinoguy: i did test the bitmapripper v1.08 

Darkfox: the custom type support though is pretty basic, it doesnt allow
deep scanning for hard files, and doesnt support conversion from raw data
to TGA =X ....yet....

but it works on simplier file structures!

i might extend the custom ripper more once i get ideas on what 
people will need too make it usefull.

Aah, sorry, I think in your list you just called it 'BitmapRip v0.8' or something, hence the confusion...
