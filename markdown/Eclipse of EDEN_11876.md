- Post Title: Eclipse of EDEN

Hello guys well, this is a old japanese game with very good graphics, the files stored in different formats as I can see, like:

Mesh = .col & .mes
SkinMesh = .skm
Texture = .edt & edv
.lit where I think is stored all files names. because is one file outside of folder called sDataList.lit.

Ok I hope somebody can take a look into files, I think before Fatduck add a beta support for this game but well I don't found nothing about unpacker or something like that, ok thanks for supporting and have a nice day guys.
