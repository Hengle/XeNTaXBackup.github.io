- Post Title: One Piece Pirate Warriors 4 PC Help

I got some models with Ninja Ripper tool.

Some models come out fine and others not so much. Pudding's model for example. Her hair and bottom of her skirt comes out deformed.

We have had the same problem in previous Pirate Warrior games before. And I think it happens for Dynasty Warriors as well. I know some others found a way to extract models with this problem fixed. Does anyone know how some have fixed this problem?
