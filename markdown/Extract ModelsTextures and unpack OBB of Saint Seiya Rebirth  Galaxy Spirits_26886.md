- Post Title: Extract Models/Textures and unpack OBB of Saint Seiya Rebirth / Galaxy Spirits

Hello, I've been trying to get the models/textures from this game, and been having difficulties even getting them from the OBB (which is not a zip file) and may be encrypted?
Apparently it was done before but the files are now offline since it's been so long.
Would love some help since the game is about to close down, apparently. It's something to keep.
