I know, rather late but nevertheless... don't prompt where to find import/reimport tool of dialogues and at a possibility of all the rest?

I unpacked volume.dat by means of QuickBMS, found one import/reimport tool but a problem in what it can unpack only gametext.bin and TaskChangeText.bin, it either doesn't open other files, or can't decipher. It is very necessary to unpack dialogues, and at an opportunity all the rest (weapon, names, missions etc.)

The gametext.bin and TaskChangeText.bin files are quietly packed back and everything works.

Thanks in advance!
