not sure why you stopped!

```
get files long
get tablestart long
get size asize
math size - tablestart
get version string
get end byte
goto size
for f = 0 < files
  get fsize long
  get fpntr long
  get unknown long
  getdstring garbage 12
  get name string
  log name fsize fpntr
next f

```


gml files are plaintext - each folder has a dbdef.gml file

all these files are part of an database system - the jane files could be entries as there's a function MdbtoJane() in the creatememdb.gml script
