What tool is used to rip these models. Maybe theres a tool to rip Wii standard 3d format (Wills tool?) which was used for mario universe as well? Maybe that works for this as well?

You need to post some sample model files or archive files if you want us to help you.
If the models are in .bress or .brmdl files i have a model viewer that van let you look at the models.
If you want to rip the models use the wii emulator dolphin in combination with 3d ripper dx.
most models from this game are very low res textures and low poly count just so you know.

My internet speed (and price) doesnt allow me to download a gigabyte file, so i cant. Too bad.
I guess ill be able to do that in September, when i get a normal internet speed.
