- Post Title: Dante's Inferno [X360] Unknown Video Format

Hello,
I'd like to ask for some help to identify what kind of video codec is used in videos from Dante's Inferno on Xbox360.

The goal is to demux FMVs (in particular the CGI cut-scenes by Blur) into video + audio streams and than merge them into more playable format (.mkv for example).

All files were extracted from bigfile0.viv using quickbms script, but they have no proper names or extensions. When attempting to play the video in VLC it gives an error about unsupported audio format, but video part plays fine though.

I tried the Video Demultiplexer from latest version of vgmtoolbox, but none of the given options turned out to be suitable for these files.

Here's a sample:

It's VP6.
