- Post Title: Gr2 / hgm importer?

Hi Guys,

I'm realativly new on Modelling, so I dicited to buy the hero engine and improve my skills
In the important part of Live   

Unfortunetelly to export gr2 files I would need a 17,5k expensive software and I have 
problems with the heroengine hgm file-format... 

Is there a woking gr2 exporter under 100 Bucks out there, or does somebody work
with this engine?


Oh and I got from Hero-engine a gr2 + hgm viewer, maby this could help you with your ''swtor 
extraction mission''   

Sry for my broken english

Mfg Tom
