no, you have not tried quickbms because I have tested it in this exact moment with the correct script reported on my website ([necrovision.bms](http://aluigi.org/papers/bms/necrovision.bms) aka "NecroVision / Painkiller series") and it works perfectly.

-_-

Do i need to show screenshot?

It shows Bad Argument at line.

Maybe because i used from Painkiller 2004 Demo. Okay now it works. I didn't know that i needed to save file as Bat, and run with quickbms

eh?
double-click on quickbms.exe and follow the steps.
if you receive an error like the one you said it means you used it from command-line in a bad way
