I've been playing too much Dead Space with the lights out at 1 in the morning for something like that to scare me...  And I'm only on level 4, but I can't stand to play it for very long...  So instead, I'll pop in Lost Planet or DMC4 (yup, I gots an XBox 360 and some games! ^_^ )

I knew that, I just felt like bragging about my new games and the easiest way to do that was by following lion's post...

Hmm, at the moment I'm playing Fallout 3 and so far that game really rocks! However, it is crash-prone. This is a very annoying setback, and the latest patch did nothing to fix it. I really wonder why Bethesda has not checked this thoroughly and this seems to be a big issue with a lot of gamers.

It's pretty spooky, but not so bad if you've got no trouble watching horror movies by yourself in the dark (like me)... Right now, I'm stuck on level 4 at a part that, oddly enough, has nothing to do with the main focus of the game (you know that old game where you're shooting from a spaceship at meteors/asteroids before they can hit your ship? yeah, it's like that, and I seem to suck at it  ). And BTW, I've only died once from a Necromorph attack so far, everything else has been environmental. ^_^

Me and my house mate are thinking of getting it in a week or so, but as i said before i wanna finish little big planet 1st (im actually on the last level now with my gf, my house mate doesn't play it), and once thats done im gonna FINALLY finish lost oddesy..im at the very end i just haven't bothered to continue with it as it kinda bores me its nothing compared to an actual FF game, then once thats done im bursting into gears of war 2.

Lost Odyssey (damn, that's a bitch to spell right)? I've been wanting to try that one... You said it doesn't stack up to FF (which I have unfortunately never played), but how is it if considered by itself?

> Lost Odyssey (damn, that's a bitch to spell right)? I've been wanting to try that one... You said it doesn't stack up to FF (which I have unfortunately never played), but how is it if considered by itself?

in my opinion the lost odyssey is nothing compared to any ff game (except ix, xi, xii and xiii which is not released yet but it will be total crap). you really MUST play a final fantasy if you're into rpgs (another series i recommend are the shin megami tensei series and spin-offs and the grandia series, especially if you like turn based rpgs, if you like the grandia series then you may also like the atelier iris series and spinoffs)

now, about lost odyssey, well, it isn't that bad, although the achievements suck COLOSSAL time and the story isn't something to dream about (literally), you're an immortal guy who spends his endless life in emocity and regret and oblivion (since he has amnesia) and being a mercenary/soldier and whatever...then in a battle, a freakin' meteor comes crushing down from the heavens obliterating both sides but you are unharmed (since when does immortality mean you can't get hurt?), then, you discover another survivor, a woman who has the same "curse" as you and you are sent on a mission with her and another guy who apparently spends his time flirting and drinking and is generally the idiot of the team...and the rest is silence (as dante from devil may cry would say)

well, aside that there aren't many mini-games (if any) which is good for some, bad for others and the gameplay is very good but the loading times are reeeeeeealy annoying...quite a good attempt at reviving the old ff-like genre if you ask me, at least they had the guts to do that, unlike square-enix that doesn't give a moogle's a$$ about how ff became popular in the first place

Heh, interesting description...  I know, I really need to try an FF game, but I've just never had the opportunity. I've also been wanting to try the Shin Megami series, thanks for pointing that out; and also Valkyrie Chronicles (I think that's what it's called)... I don't get the opportunity to play that many different games.

Well it doesnt stand up to FF but as a standalone game its alright, i wouldnt say it was GREAT but it is good fun playing through it and the battle system and gfx are nice, the story is a bit erm...anyone can think it up really...its not confusing or anything, they throw in a buncha political stuff that isnt really complicated at all its incredibly simple, and its pretty obvious who is a bad guy cos he always has "evil" type music whenever u see him, if thats not a give away Then i don't know what is.

The loading times arent too bad but yeah..they are annoying, the dream sequences actually stomp on my heart everytime i read them, and im in a perfectly good relationship and have a good life going so i feel really sorry for someone who is ALREADY depressed and starts that game...it will make them commit suicide.

The music in the game is nice though at least some tracks are, minigames...there are too few, the achievements arent too bad im trying the temple of something or other at th emoment and thats annoying me cos i cant stand the puzzles in this game they arnt even any fun.

As for FF12...screw that crap lol ^_^ and FF13 could be awsome but as a man...i dont like the idea of playing as a woman in an RPG...cos rpgs are about characters involving in things...i mean lara in tomb raider is okei because well...she is just a placeholder if u ask me...she doesnt exactly get deep into things she just does what she needs to do, she doesnt sit and tell u about her life or anything.

Im terrified that ff13 is gonna end up having some game section when u have a relationship of some kind with a male character, which normally i love...but when IM THE MAN...i dont want to do it as the woman...cant relate.

Btw ive seen that cat image before...it often gets called the "WTF CAT" on the net, saw it a few days back haha.

Btw ive seen that cat image before...it often gets called the "WTF CAT" on the net, saw it a few days back haha.

well yeah i am on disc 2 and i could tell who is a bad guy and who is not from disc 1, no plot twists which were a trademark in final fantasy games (ultimecia, zanarkand, etc), you can guess what happens later in the game at most times

as for the music, the only one i liked so far was one in a boss fight against a snake/reptile water thing, isn't the music made by nobuo uematsu anyway? *listens to one winged angel* i guess you need to have an equally good game for it to count

achievements are crap, you have to find EVERY LAST THING in the game's areas and you get only 20 gamerscore points but when you create a ring (to equip it and power yourself up, which there is no way you won't do in the entire game since all you need is to go to your menu and everything's straightforward) you get 30 points...what do you make of that, that the developers are r3tard3d? i would agree, because that's not all, you get 10 points for dealing a total of 1.000.000 damage to enemies and for getting 500 perfects (push a button at the right time when attacking) and for defeating all extra bosses and  for killing 1000 enemies and blah as if these are way easier to accomlish than pushing the directinal buttons and the A button some times after battling around 10 battles...you can view the whole r3tardment list here:

or if you do not the guide

[http://www.xbox360achievements.org/game ... ievements/](http://www.xbox360achievements.org/game/lost-odyssey/achievements/)

i'm telling you that it was the weirdest thing i ever saw in a video game and yes i've played oblivion, all the shin megami tensei games, project zero and dozens of others from rule of rose and clock tower to dracula 3 path of the dragon and nostradamus the last prophecy to bioshock to wizardry to halo to dynasty warrios to yu-gi-oh! to mercenaries to radiata stories to God knows what, it was the first time i saw something so crazy...

anyway, about the "dreams"...they were ok i guess...too depressing at times but some were magnificent, some of the few things i was looking forward to until i lost interest in the game...

as for ffxiii, well ff can go F itself for all i care anymore...that's all i want to say about ff
and aout the cat picture, i really don't know i found it using stumble upon...

at least if you're gonna make a trailer for a crappy spin-off game try making it as cool as this:
