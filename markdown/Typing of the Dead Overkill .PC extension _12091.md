- Post Title: Typing of the Dead Overkill .PC extension ?

Basically same version as House of The Dead Overkill but improved. So i was wondering is there any method of opening those files/archives whatever they are?

I am interested in modifying some sound effects, but everything seem to be "locked" in this .PC file extension.

I've also uploaded a small sample is someone wants to take a look at it.
