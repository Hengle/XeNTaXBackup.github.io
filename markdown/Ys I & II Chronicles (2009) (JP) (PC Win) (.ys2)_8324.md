Greetings.

[Here is the file](http://www.mediafire.com/?qrqvw2w2vx8bqnx) I would like to humbly ask for help with. It may be similar to Ys I & II Complete format, however [this here program](http://www.ysutopia.net/downloads/ysc/YS2BMP-DECODE.zip) checks for the filesize so it is impossible to use it with the archive here.

What I need is a single image file from that very archive. Can anyone help? Thanks in advance.

Sorry for bumping but the thread seems to have been effectively buried under a handful of new ones and I'd still appreciate some help with this. Anyone? Please.
