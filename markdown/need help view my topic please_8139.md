Well, a lot of people say that but usually they just move on when they get their stuff. You know, kind of like a politician promising you they'll work for FREE during campaign period.

Unless you had another account, all the posts you've made seem to be all asking for help for the same game.

Now a more realistic reason why no one is "bothering" to help you would be

1: they're not interested
2: not in you, but the game
3: maybe they've never heard of them
4: I've never heard of them for that matter

You have a lot of links so it looks like you've done a lot of research, but I've never heard of those tools nor do I know who created them. And of course, since I've never heard of those games before until now, I would have no idea how they're used. 

Granted, a lot of modding tools are also rather difficult to use because the people that make them tend to be programmers or other technical people that probably do not excel in user interfaces.

If there's a specific community geared towards those games as well as modding them, you'd have better luck there. This place is pretty much for everything under the sun.

Have you tried this bms to extract the files? [http://aluigi.altervista.org/papers/bms/yuke.bms](http://aluigi.altervista.org/papers/bms/yuke.bms)
And you can import yobj in max with this script by chrrox [viewtopic.php?f=16&t=6183&hilit=Rumble+Roses](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=6183&hilit=Rumble+Roses)

@finale00
it's only a waste of time to reply to similar people.
this "person" has opened another new thread (the 3rd or 4th?) just some hours ago.
I contact mrmouse to ban him.

you're confusing me just ask for help, do not help clear pidoayuda me loudly, do not spam or anything but no one answers my issue properly at the end we return to the beginning,

 aliugi you've seen the yuke.bms is something to please you or because I have a file yobj I can send the script to open it in 3ds max is that I speak English poorly, usually speak Spanish
