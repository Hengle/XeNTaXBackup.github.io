- Post Title: SCRIPT COMMISSION: Update existing .mmb script for Noesis to fix skin weights and vertex normals (M+R Sparks of Hope)

Hello! I'm currently in the process of attempting to rip models from Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope, a Nintendo Switch game that runs on Ubisoft's Snowdrop Engine. After extracting the files, I utilized an existing .mmb script for Noesis that does most of the work, but not without some unfortunate difficulties.

Firstly, the rigging is broken. Most skin weights range from large blatantly missing chunks or just appearing completely blank. Armature appears to be fine, but without intact skin weights it's largely useless.



Second issue is the buggy vertex normals, separated into grid-like sections? Vertex normals can be reset to fix most visual errors (albeit at a slight sacrifice of in-game accuracy), so this is a lesser priority and not a necessity if deemed an impossible task.



Similar issues, at least regarding the rigging, seem to have been found as early as Mario + Rabbids Kingdom Battle. These issues unfortunately have not been amended since.

As such, I'm opening a commission for someone to try their hand at tweaking the existing .mmb Noesis script to be applicable for the model files found in Sparks of Hope.

I'm admittedly not sure what quote would be appropriate for such a task, but I'm currently willing to pay $60USD upon proof of completion.
This will be done through PayPal. Other methods of payment can be discussed if necessary.
I've provided a small number of .mmb files to test this script with, so hopefully this should only need to be done once. If I were to need an update to the script, I'd be willing to pay additional amounts for further service.
This script would likely be publicly released among the VG Resource forums to assist in further model rips. Script can remain private if preferred.
