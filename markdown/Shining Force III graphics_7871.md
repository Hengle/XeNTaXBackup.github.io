- Post Title: Shining Force III graphics

There's a few files on the Saturn disc of this game which can easily be seen to be graphics files, but don't display correctly (perhaps I'm being an idiot)
The main thing here is the 3D models - I'd love to get these extracted. 

Here are MPD files, which I think are models.

These are think are possibly sprites?

I know that this is mugshots - because it displayed on TiledGGD. Just thought it might help to see? (16BPP, Little Endian, at 64px width)

This is a .chp file, which I assume would be for chipset?

If anyone could help me out here I'd really appreciate it - this game has gone a very long time without attention
