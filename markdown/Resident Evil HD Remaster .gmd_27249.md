Hello guys. I am looking to translate this game and i need to use the Russian version as a base for the translation but i am having difficulties opening and translating the .gmd files that contain the text. I have tried the tool from here: [https://residentevilmodding.boards.net/ ... sue-solved](https://residentevilmodding.boards.net/thread/3385/remaster-file-tool-issue-solved) but it seems like it does not work with the Cyrillic text. Does anyone have a tool to extract the text and reimport it back into the .gmd files? I am adding 2 examples of files 1 in English and 1 in Russian.

Bulgarian, which is like 99% similar but without some letters that are used in the Russian alphabet.
