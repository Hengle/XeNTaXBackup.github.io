- Post Title: Rabi-Ribi game archive (.kanobi)

Hello everyone. I need help with that game - [https://store.steampowered.com/app/400910/](https://store.steampowered.com/app/400910/)
Some time ago there was a solution for extracting/reimporting .kanobi archive files via QuickBMS + heart_of_crown script.
It works well before latest patch (1.99i and newer), but for now some changes occur so .kanobi files cannot be processed with that method anymore.
I've got some information from another forum about this:

"Now the header is no longer encrypted and it uses 64bit fields.
The data and the rest of the information (names, TOC) are encrypted."

Here is the links to the archive samples:
Old file (old method working) - [https://www.dropbox.com/s/bgrb0hha6nn9y ... anobi?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/bgrb0hha6nn9y8c/old_dlc0.kanobi?dl=0)
New file (old method won't working) - [https://www.dropbox.com/s/lzg2h56xf7xcz ... anobi?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/lzg2h56xf7xczc7/dlc0.kanobi?dl=0)

Any help appreciated.
