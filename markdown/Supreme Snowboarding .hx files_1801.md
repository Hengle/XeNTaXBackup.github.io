- Post Title: Supreme Snowboarding .hx files

Hi all,

For some time now, I've been trying to find software to edit Supreme Snowboarding(aka Boarder Zone) HX files. This game is still played by many gamers, since it's one of the only good snowboarding games for PC.

It's still being modded by some enthousiastic people, but until today, they are limited to editing textures, levels (there's an ingame leveleditor!) and ascii config-files.   

The 3d-files are in HX-format, from the SuRender engine.
I recently mailed to the game developers, but they lost the sourcecode for the 3d Studio Max Export/Import plugin. I do have some sourcecode from the total SuRender engine, containing information on the HX-format.
I also included this sourcode. It cannot be compiled as-is, but it might be of use to anyone?

I really hope there's someone out there that knows how to open such a file, or can do something with the sourcecode provided in the second post... Thanks in advance for helping out!
