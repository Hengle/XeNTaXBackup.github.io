This game files are packaged in several .data files. Is possible obtain a bms script or another tool to extract all them?
Thanks!

Hi

sm_seastone ==>animation clip


Here is an unpacker and a model importer.
It requires Blender version 249b and Python version 2.6.6.
How use:
1.run Blender249.blend
2.in Blender Text Window press alt+p and select:
- *.data  - for unpacking
- *.*  - for rigged and textured models. All models are in scene pose. (not T-pose)
Script is not perfect.
