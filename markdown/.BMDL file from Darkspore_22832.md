- Post Title: .BMDL file from Darkspore

I recently started making a mod for the SPORE game based on the Darkspore game (similar to an existing mod called Dark Injection).


however i have been having some problems to export some game files, i haven't found much out there, just a script for blender 2.71 that works well on some files .bmdl



and in some files it just doesn't work.



the original game is dead, EA abandoned the game by closing the servers, but it is still possible to download the game via steam with a link, despite being named as Demo, inside the folder the game is complete with all files.




I believe that the engine used to create Darkspore is the same as that of SPORE, because their files are very similar from the outside (.package and folders). Using a program created to create SPORE mods, I was able to extract the Darkspore .package files, however it only supports files used in SPORE and .bmdl is not included



any idea how to make this script work on these files?

BMDL_environments.package extrated (example files)
