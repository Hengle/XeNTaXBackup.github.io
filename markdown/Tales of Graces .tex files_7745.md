After doing a google search on your nickname, I can assume you're not after translating the game to english,
but playing with game textures, If so, perhaps you can ask Tempus who previously worked on graphic formats for this game, you can explain that you won't translate the game and he may give you some documentation, that's of course if you didn't get help from here (make it a last resort)

I've been trying to avoid that, he said somewhere that he wouldn't give out the tools the ToG team used during their translation, but I'll keep it in mind regardless as a desperate measure.

bump since the game was localized on tuesday

I contacted Tempus, he wasn't willing to share his tools though.
