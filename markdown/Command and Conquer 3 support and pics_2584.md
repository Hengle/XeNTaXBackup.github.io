- Post Title: Command and Conquer 3 support and pics

I've added a script for C&C 3 *.BIG files at the Game File Format Central (XentaxWIKI). Users of MultiEx Commander can use it by chosing the WIKI in the Options Dialog. Make sure to select the unofficial WIKI formats in the Open Archive dialog to access the support. If it works, why not VOTE for the script (go to Supported Games list in MexCom to do that). With 5 votes Aye it will become an Official MexScript. 

Here's some graphics I found in misc.big and a table of contents showing all the ini files in there, saved using MexCom (go to File menu).

There's still some compression on some of those ini files though...Not supported in the script.
