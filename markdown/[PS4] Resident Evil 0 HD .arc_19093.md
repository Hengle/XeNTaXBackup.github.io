- Post Title: [PS4] Resident Evil 0 HD .arc

I'm not sure if it's the .tex (textures) or .arc that's different from the pc version's file format so I'm going to post in both sections here on XeNTaX.

No Matter what I do I can't seem to convert the .tex extension thought maybe one you guys have an idea as to why, The .rar contains ps4 .arc and two extracted from different bats which are PC and PS3 (Using FluffyQuack's ArcTool)

PS4 version used swizzling
In this case, em02_00face_BM.tex uses the texture format Bc1, which is an analog dxt1
