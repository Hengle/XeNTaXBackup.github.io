- Post Title: Android .obb files (repack problem)

I want to know how to repack obb for android games files?
I mean those bobs Wichita them we can open it with zip or winrar
it's possible to extract with zip tools but we can't use repacked bobs in game... because game will close or game will show a black screen
any body know how repack obb files without problem? (obb is PK is type, like a zip file)
