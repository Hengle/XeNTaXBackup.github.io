Hey, everyone. I've been trying to extract character models from JJBA: ASB/EoH for some time now. I'm able to get the textures and models out of the game via Noesis, but they don't have the rigging or bone data. Does anyone here know how I can get these? Any help would be greatly appreciated.

I really need to get off my lazy butt and finish up my own importer for this game -- everything on the model side is done, but I just need to figure out how to extract those pesky XFBIN files properly. I'll post it here when it's finally ready.
