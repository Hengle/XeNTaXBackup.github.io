- Post Title: Has anyone decrypted Forza 3 'gamedb.slt' file for xbox 360

I've created a few mods for Forza 3 but obviously it has to be done via dlc which is a long and drawn out process. It would make FM3 modding so much easier,so much faster if we could only modify the actual 'gamedb.slt' file.
Anyway, has anyone decrypted the gamedb.slt yet?
I have heard the the security is pretty tight for Forza 3 but it never hurts to ask.
I can upload the file if need be.
Thanks.
