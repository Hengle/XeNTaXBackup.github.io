- Post Title: .tbd file? Metal Fatgue on PC

Hello,

Have seen an old thread where someone successfully extracted all the sounds from a .tbd file from Metal Fatgue.

[viewtopic.php?f=10&t=2986&start=15](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=2986&start=15)

Anyone able to offer any insight as the link is long dead 

Any help appreciated!

Cheers
