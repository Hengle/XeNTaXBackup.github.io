- Post Title: Import Tuner Challenge (Shutoko Battle X) .DAT .TOC files

Hi, i'm having trouble figuring out how to extract car files from Import Tuner Challenge's .DAT files. They come with .TOC files which i think is some kind of list or helper file to load the .DAT file. The .DAT file is too big for me to upload since i have low upload speed, so i'm sending the .TOC file instead.
I really appreciate any attempt on trying to extract resources or files from this game files, since the car model contains detailed 3d engine, interior, and doorpanels. And in case if no one knew, this is an XBOX 360 file.
I uploaded two .TOC files for this attempt.
[http://www.mediafire.com/?wjtzmkedd4f4mx2](http://www.mediafire.com/?wjtzmkedd4f4mx2) (BUILD.TOC)
[http://www.mediafire.com/?d14qm7p0hu1h10n](http://www.mediafire.com/?d14qm7p0hu1h10n) (BUILD_CRS.TOC)
If the files containts inappropriate content or others, please inform me so i can manually remove the links or the files directly.

Use any FileCutter and cut ~ 10-50mb (begin and end of file)

Well, few things before i say my reply : i'm not someone good with codes and hex editing or even resource extraction, and mostly just use tools and do the thing that that tool was for (like extracting).
So now for my reply :
I tried googling for FileCutter and it turns out it's for mac. I don't really know any names for such program, so i guess i'm out of luck? :\

EDIT : Never mind that. I found one and here's the file in 10 MB size : [http://www.mediafire.com/download/f5u48 ... _CRS.DAT.0](http://www.mediafire.com/download/f5u485t4w4bnin7/BUILD_CRS.DAT.0)
