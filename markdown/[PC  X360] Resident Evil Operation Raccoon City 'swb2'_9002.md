- Post Title: [PC / X360] Resident Evil: Operation Raccoon City 'swb2'

Greetings. I'd need an extractor/repacker/converter for this file format, both PC and X360 versions. I have reasons to believe some parts of the PC release have been locked out and they can be easily unlocked using specific X360 files.

Samples available on request as this game is part of my collection already.
