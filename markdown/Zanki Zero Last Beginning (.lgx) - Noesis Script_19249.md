- Post Title: Zanki Zero: Last Beginning (.lgx) - Noesis Script

I wanted to practice Noesis scripting a bit, and this looked like a good format. Supports meshes, skeleton/weights, materials/textures.

Noesis crashes sometimes when loading models, seems to be because of some GXT textures. Try loading the model again few times, if it still doesn't work disable texture loading (line 36). Main characters work fine most of the time.

Hey some new .lgx models from "Doraemon Nobita no Shin Kyoryu" (SWITCH) will this plugin work for these ?

I was looking at the PC version of that game over the weekend. I got the character models working, but didn't look at anything else. I can release a tool soon.

No idea about Doraemon. I am not really interested in that game.

How would I go about getting this to work for the PC version? The files seem to be different.
