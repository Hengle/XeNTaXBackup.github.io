- Post Title: Getting 500 Internal Server Error while posting new thread

Hi, a newb here.

I have a problem with this forum; whether I try to post a thread (or upload an attachment), it always returns a 500 Internal Server Error. Tried & refreshed many times and still no good   

What should I do? D:
