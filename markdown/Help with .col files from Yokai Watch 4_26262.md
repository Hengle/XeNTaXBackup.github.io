- Post Title: Help with .col files from Yokai Watch 4

Hi, today i need help because i have extracted the romfs of Yokai Watch 4 and in the romfs folder i have found some .col files (i think for collisions). But there is the problem i don't know how to decrypt .col files. I really hope someone can help me pls. PS : I have opened a .col file in HxD and in the text view i can see PXCL0 (i hope it can be useful). Thanks for reading and i hope you can help me !
