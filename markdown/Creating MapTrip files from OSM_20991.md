- Post Title: Creating MapTrip files from OSM

This is unrelated to game files but thought someone here could help. I am trying to create my own maps for the android app MapTrip Navigation, as it's one of the only apps available for free that supports mirrorlink. It uses OpenStreetMaps map files. You can download sample maps [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=134bMuM0AWQ5Oc00YJyCZR00faHIj53bf), as well as the apk in case you can reverse the app itself.
