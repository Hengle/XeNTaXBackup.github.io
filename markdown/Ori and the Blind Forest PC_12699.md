I opened up the files with Notepad++. They are "typical" Unity files that can be unpacked, but it won't let me do so.

Anyways:

SharedAssets1.assets and SharedAssets2.assets has some menu text, and maybe some console related text in it (like "Installing the game")

SharedAssets3.assets has the menu text in it (like Tap X to access the Ability Tree, or World Events in the start menu...etc)

SharedAssets10.assets has some dialog in it that the little spirit says (Unfortunately it only has the text for the dialogs and some menu items, but not the ones that pop up when the deep voice is telling the story)


You can edit the text and it will display it, but it can't be longer than the one already provided (think HEX Editor translating games).

So yeah, we need an unpacker/repacker for this (maybe an upgraded unity_wcx for Total Commander?)
