- Post Title: (PC) Original Dead Space .geo

With [nightFlarer's work on the Dead Space 2 .geo](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=5966&start=30), I wonder if anybody would be willing to go back and work with the [original game's .geo](http://img27.imageshack.us/img27/2758/geoinxvi32.jpg) format?

I will supply files to those that want to take a look at them.
