- Post Title: Dungeons and Dragons: Chronicles of Mystara (gfx.rom)

I've been wanting to get the "HD Graphics" from this steam release, but apparently it uses one big archive within a zip file. Once extracting the zip file, it results in two ".rom" files akin to the typical arcade files, but I can't seem to find any suitable method for extracting the graphics within. I have here the specific .rom archive I want to get the sprites out of, and I was hoping someone could figure up a way to do so.
