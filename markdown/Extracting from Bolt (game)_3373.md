- Post Title: Extracting from Bolt (game)

Hello 

I want to extract Bolt's model, so I can use it in 3DS Max.

When I use 3DRipperDX it only extracts an invisible mesh.
If I go into wireframe mode you can see what it extracts, and the rest stays colored and isn't in wireframe, and those are the things I need.

Look here :

Here are also the files for Bolt

Those files you posted look like plain maya files with ma bee a custom header or something.
I am not familiar with maya enough to know how it should look.
3d ripper dx should work fine just un check all the options when you import it and I bet it will show up.

Well, I don't have Maya :p

Is there a way to convert these to a format I can use in 3DS Max?

I got this game to work (show the missing characters) with 3DRipper by UNCHECKING every option EXCEPT "show textures in viewport" (so it will still show the textures)

In the limited testing I have done thus far, I have not found a combination of settings in 3dripper that will still get the characters..but NOT the hud and a whole lot of extra volume meshes (lots of domes and planar meshes and what not) So you have a bit of cleaning up to do, but it will get the characters this way. Not in a nice default pose mind you like an asset extractor/importer would do. (no such thing for this game BTW) But it's better than nothing!

Yep. But the "real" models show up too when you set the parameters that way.

Hello world!) i ned this model too, +Penny character.

some peoples can extract models in initial pose. They says "we using video memory cache, like 3d Ripper DX". I tried, but models capturing "in motion", or i having scrambled models in initial pose.




SuperQuestion:

How they do it?
