Need help opening  2  files

files are compressed:

```
-file_size    INT
-unpack_size  INT

```

i made 2 plugin for noesis:
-'fmt_UNPACK_DAT.py' for unpack *.DAT, (after unpacking, an FPS4 file will appear next to the original)
-'fmt_UNPACK_DDS.py' unpack all .DDS file from FPS4

FPS4 contains dds textures and meshes.
example 'EP_1420_010.FPS4'
vertex offset 0x50D60
indices offset 0x57B14 (tri strip?)

vbuf is divided into submesh (vertices first, then normals)
I don't have time now to look for submesh and information about them.
here is part of the vertex cloud of the head

look at [this](https://zenhax.com/viewtopic.php?f=17&t=7018&hilit=FPS4) topic, maybe there is something there.

In the Blender249[TalesOfVesperia][PC][svo][dat][dec][2019-02-03] did anyone figure out how to fix  the no hair problems.
