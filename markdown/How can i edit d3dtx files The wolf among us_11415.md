Like the title says, do you know how to edit the d3dtx or to extract the dds inside of it?

Thanks for the answer, but i already know the luigi's file extractor, and i was recently in touch with him and told me that the d3dtx are headerless dds files, and the program can't extract it. So, if there is any you know from the Tolma4 Team who can tell you, please tell me. I tried to contact Den Em, but he seems to be  bussy. Thanx
