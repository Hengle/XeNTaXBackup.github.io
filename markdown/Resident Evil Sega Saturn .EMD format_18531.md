- Post Title: Resident Evil Sega Saturn .EMD format

Greetings. I'm currently trying to find a way to unpack RE1 .EMD formats from SS version. However, due to my inexperience in researching file formats, I haven't made a lot of progress. According to what I've found, SS .EMDs have both PS1 mesh/textures inside and the ones from SS, and ["prsdec"](https://segaretro.org/File:Prsdec_auto.7z) is required to decompress the file into .bin (You'll have to rename .emd to .prs first). It's just I don't know what to do next. Could anybody interested in this try and assist me? [Here is an example file](https://puu.sh/B6Vca.EMD). Also [BioFAT](https://www.romhacking.net/utilities/1019/) author claims there's SS support in tool's latest version, though actually it cannot disassemble the format. I've tried it with [old version](https://puu.sh/B6Vay.rar) and it just gave out PS1 model instead of the one from SS.
Thanks in advance.
