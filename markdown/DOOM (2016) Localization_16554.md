I've written a small tool that should be able to decrypt/encrypt these .bfile files, you can grab it at [https://www.reddit.com/r/DOOM2016Mods/c ... ng_bfiles/](https://www.reddit.com/r/DOOM2016Mods/comments/6u744t/idcrypt_10_allows_decrypted_and_encrypting_bfiles/)

Haven't had a chance to test re-encrypted files ingame yet, but they seem to decrypt fine with the tool. If you have any problems let me know!

Thanks for the help! If I have problems, I will contact you. 
Perhaps your tool will help in localization Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus

Hello,

we're currently working on translation for the last DOOM (2016) and we encountered a problem with correct displaying of some characters. Fonts are solved, but there is a .bswf format that we don't know anything about it and what contains and it can cause these problems with displaying.

here is what I get, when I use all the diacritics in menu label: [https://i.imgur.com/SrazX16.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/SrazX16.jpg)


Thanks in advance
