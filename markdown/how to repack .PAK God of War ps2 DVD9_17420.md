- Post Title: how to repack .PAK God of War ps2 DVD9

Hey guys!

Recently ive started to modify some audio - videos files (no rip) of god of war DVD9.
but im unable to find any tool to repack all of these files into the PART1.PAK and PART2.PAK separatly, most of the tools out there, gives me 1 big file 7.92gb (typically NEW_PART1.PAK) and clearly this tools are made of to ripping DVD9 to DVD5 4.7gb.

So basically i want to know, if exist tool-method to do this task.

Have you tried Munge Explorer? I forget how it rebuilds as its been a long time since I wrote it but send me some sample files and I can see if it is possible to rebuild to the original files.

So ive use this tool and loaded the .toc and .pak with no problems,. i see all files inside of pak, but when i extracted the files, doesnt play any sound or movie, ive compared files in hex editor with files extracted from munge o matic (screenshots) and clearly is different one each other, maybe i did something wrong?

some error when extract files


hex editor files compared (1 munge explorer - 2 munge o matic working file)
