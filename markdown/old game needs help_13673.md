- Post Title: old game needs help

hello,
i was wondering if this site. had any info about birth of the federation. and ways to backwards engineer the source code for the game. it was lost in 15 years ago. we have been able to work slowly on the binary code but with little gains. does anyone know of a way to crack this game to get code we can work with.
