Hi! 
CPK\ file is the same format used in Bayonetta First Climax (X360).
Did you try Quickbms?

Thanks! The script worked wonderfully.   There appear to be 4 different kinds of files in the archive, I made topics for all of them except the .MSG format due to how easy it is to rip the strings from them.

Topics:
.AMB - viewtopic.php?f=18&t=5564 -
.CSB - viewtopic.php?f=17&t=5562 -
.BRSAR - viewtopic.php?f=17&t=5561 -
