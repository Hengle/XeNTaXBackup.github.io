Mo Jie 2 / Magic World 2 - uses Gamebryo engine. I don't know the version of the engine cause files are packed.
So need help to find the way of extracting the archives.
Screens of the game look nice.

Here is the example of 2 small packed files.

Is it this game?

Speaking of gamebryo, I'd love an import script for all gamebryo formats.
People say "just use nifSkope don't waste your time" but it only supports OBJ export (last time I checked) so kind of pointless for anyone that wants to use the models.

Hmmm...i think yes, i tried to search on forum "mo Jie 2", didn't tried translation of the name.
Anyway, looked at the topic, but didn't understand how to extract the archive.

P.S. About Gamebryo, what do you mean?...there are exist scripts for max and blender to import models and animations.

Weird lol I don't know how to open it either.

There are?

Gamebryo's the one with the nif extension right?
Niftools stopped supporting their maxscript and blender awhile ago I think (20.0.3...?) and I don't know if they just didn't have any time to work on it.

Szkaradek123 made a blender importer for Catherine witch uses a newer version of nif. I have no clue how he did because I sent the info to the guys in niftools but they have not done anything with it yet
