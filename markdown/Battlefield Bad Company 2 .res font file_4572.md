No.
I found that these files are 8BPP raw images with 92-bit header

And what? You can't edit them directly. I have converted *.res to *.dds and now can see font characters, but can't convert it back to .res format. Maybe that's the reason why Czech translators made translation without diacritics

I think the .res file is basicly a .dds, just the header is changed. If you can see the .res and your converted .dds file in hex mode, and you can't see any changes, just in the first some bytes, than I'm right. And convert back is easy: replace the changed bytes between the .res and the .dds .

Yep Evin, you are right. Data are the same, just headers are different.

One more important thing: because this is a .dds, it's better, if the size of the .res file stay constant.
