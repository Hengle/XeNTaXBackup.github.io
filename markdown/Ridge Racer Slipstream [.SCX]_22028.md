- Post Title: Ridge Racer Slipstream [*.SCX]

I was wondering if anyone has any experience with SCX files, which is what Ridge Racer Slipstream uses. There are a few others, but I know about the PVR textures, they're annoying, but can be worked with, the SCX files on the other hand are a mystery to me.

Edited. Cause yes, I'm a dumbass and they are SCX files, not OCX files.

I see no "OCX" but only "scx" files, which however are of the same container format as the pvr and the xml files. These scx files obviously contain geometry data:

Wow, I fundamentally KNOW they are SCX files, cause I looked at them. I don't know how I got hooked on saying OCX. Especially since S and O are on opposite sides of the keyboard, but alright.

And, I'd love to know how you imported that, especially since the tracks appear to be.. more or less like lego, light poles, parts of roads, background elements, etc, a giant tedious pain in the ass to actually get the track models into one cohesive unit.
