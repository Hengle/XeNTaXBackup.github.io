- Post Title: DreamCast ADX vs PlayStation 2 ADX

Okay. so i finally rewrote my ADX Detection and ripper into Jaeder Naub,
and while testing out it will rip ADX just terrific.
However, when i rip ADX audio from a PS2 game they will playback
just splendid using an ADX codec in winamp,
but from the Dreamcast game i tried it just plays noise.
(but it will atleast play it, so im pretty sure its a legit ADX header)
(i also tried just changing the ADX header a bit in the DC rip just to see if
the player complains, and yes it did by crashing, so there is something else)

anyone knows what the difference between DC ADX and PS2 ADX is
and is it possible to fix this somehow?

im uploading examples just incase

Okay, some rewriting to my ADX detector and now it will
properly detect length of ADX waves, which ripped
out the Dreamcast ADXes correctly,

the ADXes replay correctly except that there is a continous
noiseclick during the whole playback, but the music/sound
is there in the background.

Ill attach a WAV file of the dreamcast ADX,
playing at low volume so you dont damage your ears 

and as you can hear, the music itself is replaying in the background
correctly. except for the frequent noiseclicking.
