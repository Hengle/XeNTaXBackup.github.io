- Post Title: Chain Chronicle Encription

Hi, could someone put an eye on these and tell me which encryption method it uses?
They are from a now dead game called Chain Chronicle by SEGA, made in Unity for Android



Some files start with the same couple lines, some others don't, but they are all supposed to be of the same kind
I read is a very common encryption method but my ignorance on the matter prevents me from finding which one is.

I only need the compression method, I think I can handle it from there, but if you wanna bother yourself providing a way to unencrypt them, that would be supper helpful

Thanks in advance to anyone who takes its time
