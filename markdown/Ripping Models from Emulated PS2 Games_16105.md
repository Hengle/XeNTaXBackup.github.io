- Post Title: Ripping Models from Emulated PS2 Games?

Hey there, I downloaded PCSX2 to emulate a couple of PS2 games I want to rip models from, how do I rip 3D models? I don't care about the textures, just the models themselves. I want to use the character models from the Last Airbender games as bases for my own 3D modelling work.

I know there's a snapshot function where you hold Shift and F8 and the emulator takes a still shot of the game, but for some reason the 3D file it extracts isn't showing up as a OBJ file, only something called a .GS.

Can anyone help me out with this?

You need 0.9.8 version to get obj files from taken snapshots

Ah okay, is it just that version that does it or something? I have 1.4.0 which is the latest version, so I figure it would already be able to get the OBJs from the snaps right?

I don't know why snapshots .obj files was disabled in new versions,but if you read or see some tutorials you might notice what you'll need 0.9.8 version.
Good luck with ripping.

P.S I was have the same problem and i got it fixed by downloading 0.9.8 version.
