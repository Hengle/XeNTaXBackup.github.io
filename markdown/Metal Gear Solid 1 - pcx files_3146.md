- Post Title: Metal Gear Solid 1 - pcx files

Hello!

I'm new to this forum, but I've spend a lot of time reading topics before I registred.
I'm trying to get a hold of all the MGS 1 textures (pc version). 
First the file structure:

VOX - Folder containing all the speech and sound effects
DEMO - Folder containing DMO files, which are the movie scripts.
FONTS - Empty folder
MDX - Folder containing the BGM
MLOG - Folder containing BMP files 
MOVIE - Containing MPEG2 (sort of) movies 

Now there is also a very important .mgz file, stage.mgz. I've unpacked this file 
using "game extractor" and it extracted the folder stage, containing a lot of folders
and .dar and .qar files. I've unpacked these files using Turfster's Solidus, and I am able
to get some textures, but only about 15% of the total amount. 

For example a screenshot:



And a clearly recognizable texture:



I'm hoping someone is able to help me with this. 

Also, I was wondering if there has been some success in extracting and displaying the level models of this game??
