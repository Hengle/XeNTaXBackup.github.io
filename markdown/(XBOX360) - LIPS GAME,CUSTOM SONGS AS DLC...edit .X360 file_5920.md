I haven't looked into the song formats as of yet, I may do it in the future, but I have a website and forums hosted by XeNTaX, called the Xbox Hacking Portal, and we made a mod you made be interested in.  It combines all of the Lips games into an All-In-One game, so you have access to all 180 songs from the different versions without having to start up each game separately.  The discussion, download, and details on the modification are here:

thanks for your reply, i saw it's a very interesting thing to try, but referring to 360 iso forum it'a a big thread into jtag section where is available all the collection of 600 official DLC, but obviously is illegal...

Mine purpose is to make a leap ahead, creating custom dlc you could use your music, and it would be fantastic, the music available in marketplace is not so much good...too many crap...

however thanks for the info, O will open a similar thread into that forum!
