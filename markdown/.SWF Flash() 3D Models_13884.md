- Post Title: .SWF Flash(?) 3D Models

Hello everyone!

I've found a game that seems to be made on flash and indeed,it has 3D models in it.
I wonder if there's a way to convert them to .OBJ or somrthing like that?
Every model comes as .SWF file and seems to contain both 3D model and textures

Here are the examples

I hope someone may find a way to extract them,that would be awesome!
I really need some of them to make bluepints for my cars

I could extract your samples down to a folder full of files with 7-zip   
*.87 looks like collada dae files
*.35 are textures viewable with XnView

for the .87 ones which are no xmls but binaries you can try offzip.
In the 0000000c.dat I found many submeshes but failed to get the second one in a proper manner.
First SM:

@AceWell: cool idea to try 7zip  (using an swf extractor I got 25 jpegs, 4 png/bmps and one further swf frame only from azlk2140)

The thing is that people were telling me that there are no 3D models in "flash" area but they are indeed 3D models  
So I don't really know how could it work...It should end up like a lowpoly car with detailed textures.

It's not that much if a needed thing,just the fact that this thing exist and how to access it seemed strange and uniqe to me

Flash games actually have models now? I though at most, models were merely code executed to generate shapes that looked like 3D models. Wow.
