- Post Title: [request] Unpacking "Run Sackboy! Run!" with QuickBMS

I've been trying to find a way to unpack the PAK file of Run Sackboy! Run!, but none of them work with this PAK file. Can anybody try to create a unpacker for this game? This is a free app, so there shouldn't be any worries. [https://mega.co.nz/#!69oVQTZZ!7PAWm8vxu ... 9-EhRE4SCA](https://mega.co.nz/#!69oVQTZZ!7PAWm8vxuapXLNfnaFYDE5HNZY0kYtdr19-EhRE4SCA)
