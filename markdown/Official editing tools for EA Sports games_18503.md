Does anyone know if EA has ever published any kind of official editing tools or mod tools or SDKs for any of the EA Sports titles? (old or new, any sport at all on any platform as long as it is an EA-made sports or racing title)
Or are the only things out there tools made by the community?

Any leaked tools that are out there would also be of value.

YES it does count and where can I get a copy? (assuming its an official EA published tool and not something someone else wrote)

[This one?](https://forums.nba-live.com/downloads.php?cat=1)

Although, something from they're EAGL engine they used in the NFS series would be amazing to surface.

Not sure if this is helpful but it's some open source stuff from EA:
