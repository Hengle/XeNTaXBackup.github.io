- Post Title: Perfect World: Extracting And Viewing 3D Models

It's a Chinese MMORPG based on Chinese culture, but i didn't need to tell you that. It's a game I picked up on and couldn't help but love the character models within. I ended up making several characters, but I found more action going on in my head for them than the actual game provided (slight disassociation) and so I decided that it's best I ported the models from the game, in one way or another, to another format I could use in programs like Blender or 3ds max. I came as far as extracting the models from the client, file-wise [models.pck > extracted data], but unable to convert them or import them into a more universal format (e.g. .OBJ or .FBX). So I do have the files, I just can not do anything with them.

My expertise is limited, however I am eager to learn. Is it possible to extract data from the game, given enough time, or is it more practical to rip data from 3d runtimes from the Angelica game engine? Perfect World runs on Angelica 3D.

Ok, well I've figured out how to capture geometry with 3dripperdx. And tested, it works! 

One last feat before I delve into the world of hexadecimal hackings, that is make some sense of Perfect World .ski (skin) model files and be able to implement an importer for Blender or 3ds Max.
