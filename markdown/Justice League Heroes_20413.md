I don't know if anyone has successfully extracted 3D models from this game. 
However, some years ago, someone made an attempt with the [PS2](https://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=10665) version of the game, but there were no updates, from what I can tell. 
I tried to seek help from the [ZenHax](https://www.zenhax.com/) website, but the site won't let me register.

I currently have the game files from the Xbox version, but I can also take some time to download and look at the PS2 version, if I have to.
With QuickBMS, I managed to extract some .vif files from the .lmp containers. 
I believe the .vif files are supposed to be the 3D mesh data. 
If there is no tool that can convert the .vif file format into a usable 3D mesh format, then I may have to try ripping the models with Ninja Ripper. 
Question is, which Xbox emulator or PS2 emulator do I use in conjunction with Ninja Ripper? 
Hope someone here can lead me in the right direction, or possibly someone interested can share this with an expert from the [ZenHax](https://www.zenhax.com/) forums.

-EDIT- Ian Brown ([bigianb](https://github.com/bigianb)), developer of [BGDA-Explorer](https://github.com/bigianb/bgda-explorer/), recently told me:

> The VIF files are PS2 VIF streams and so are PS2 specific - I would not expect the xbox port to use such a format. 
> It would be weird for the xbox version to work. I'll see if I can find a cheap copy on ebay and look. I have the JLH PS2 disc somewhere which I can dig out and take a look.
I don't know how similar the Xbox version of the game is to the PS2 version, but if what he is saying is true, then I may have the wrong version.
