This game made by French Devs Kylotonn and published by Altus has some of the best\most realistic swordplay animations i've ever seen in a game. You can take a look here: /watch?v=ZxFhEUI6Q5g

Model files:[http://www.sendspace.com/file/hdhiyu](http://www.sendspace.com/file/hdhiyu)
Anim files:[http://www.sendspace.com/file/m3andr](http://www.sendspace.com/file/m3andr)

Putting these here in case someone is interested and hopefully the format isnt too hard to decypher and make some sort of plugin for noesis

That's funny coincidence, I was looking at format not so long ago. I've got almost everything to work geometry/uv's+weights. But I've failed with bones position   So if someone will give insight on them it will be cool
