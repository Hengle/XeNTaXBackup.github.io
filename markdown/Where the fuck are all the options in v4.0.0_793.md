Where the fuck are all the options in v4.0.0?

I opened the MultiEx Commander v3.9.68 .exe from the source where I have several tools like Mex3Srictor, viewing the current archive's format, web update, etc.
But when I download and install v4.0.0 the only tools are Options, file association preferences, view detected plugins and Run custom script on...

Plz help.

They are no longer in, as it seems it is only rarely used, if at all. 

If you want I can upload the latest tool, Mexbinder+, which is my personal tool that includes the scriptor. You can use the binder to open the mc.mrf file and extract the scripts. And view/edit them in MexScriptor. 

You want to edit the scripts?

Yeah, but if you remove them, simply noone can use them.
I think it would be a good idea to offer the Editing tools as a separate download in the downloads section. Then those people who wanna use them can download them.

My thoughts exactly.   

I will add them to the downloads.

So I open \MultiEx Commander\data\config\mc.mrf with MexBinder and then click on the Save formats individually... button.
If I now choose "Save BMS as text - No" everything works fine, but if I choose Yes and if I then select a directory it tells me "Runtime-Error 438: Object doesn't support that attribute or method"

Yeah.   Hey, you wanted the tool, this is the state it is in at the moment. You don't need that option anyway. In the readme.txt it says 'it is not supported'.
