- Post Title: *.STR Files

Hi 
I'm ripping some stuff from an xbox (original) game and I noticed that ~90% of the files have an -STR extension, all the sites I've found say these are music files but the music files in this game are -MUS files, whilst the other audio files are easily openable -EXA files.
So I'd say these -STR files contain compressed models and textures but I prefer to ask just to be sure, does anyone here know what else it could be? 
Thanks

It's from the game From Russia With Love, I've posted a topic about the PSP version on the Graphic File formats forum but this time it's the xbox (original) version.

Here are some of the files : [https://www.sendspace.com/file/5s59rt](https://www.sendspace.com/file/5s59rt)

not without spending time reversing the format (which is what this forum does). i didn't get very far:

```
//--- 010 Editor v5.0 Binary Template
//--------------------------------------

void align() {
  FSeek((FTell()+2047)& ~2047);
}

char coTS[4];
uint a, b, c, d;

struct Entry
{
  uint a, b;
  uint unkn;
  uint c;
  uint len;
  char oname[len];
  uint pad[4];
  uint len2;
  char name[len2];
  uint fnlen;
  char fn[fnlen];

  ubyte data[b];
};

align();Entry e1;
align();Entry e2;
FSeek(0x7e800);
//ushort skipme;
Entry e3;

```

Sorry to be insistent but is anyone able to give me some advice on how to open these pesky files or at least on how I could figure out how to do it by myself ?
