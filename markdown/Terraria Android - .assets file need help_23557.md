- Post Title: Terraria Android - .assets file need help

Hi I want to translate Terraria Android but I have a problem.  I used UABE and opened the data.unity3d file. I extracted the resources.assets file with the language file from the data.unity3d file. And I put it in the directory where the data.unity3d file is. The game opened but it took too long to open. Does anyone have any idea what I need to do for the game to open fast?

(I think I need to compress it again.)

Here is the data.unity3d file
