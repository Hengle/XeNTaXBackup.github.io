Hello all. I'm trying to rip music from said game. It was released on both GCN and PS2 and either game is fine. 

When I open the GCN version in Dolphin, here are the files I find: [https://i.imgur.com/E4stUxh.png](https://i.imgur.com/E4stUxh.png)

The PS2 version has a .bin and a .cue. Anyone have any idea how I can do this?

Okay so I've learned the .dig files can be explored to find the music. Can someone explain how you can open them?
