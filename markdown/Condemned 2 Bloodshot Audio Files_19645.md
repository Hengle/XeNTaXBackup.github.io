- Post Title: Condemned 2: Bloodshot Audio Files

Hi there guys,

I've recently came across the game data files for Condemned 2: Bloodshot or otherwise known as the hardest gamerip ever. The files were extracted from the XBOX360 iso which contain I do believe the music files as well as the SFXs and voice overs. Yet the files are under a format ARCH.02 that after further research is a Monolith Archive File mostly used for games like the FEAR Series. Is there any program or BMS script that could help with extracting the music files. I can PM the files if anyone needs them.

Thanks
