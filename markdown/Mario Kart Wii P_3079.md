- Post Title: Mario Kart Wii :P

Hiya, 

Last week I finally recieved my copy of Mario Kart Wii, and great addictive fun it is too! The wheel gadget works excellently, and I ordered another one, so a mate can join in on the fun at my place. The online racing works like a charm too. Awesome stuff. Anyone else got this ? Perhaps we can race against eachother some time!  
My nickname is "The Age", short for "The Age of Chaos", which is my multiplayer nickname .
