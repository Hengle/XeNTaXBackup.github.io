- Post Title: Getamped. How can I decrypt .kar file extension?

I need all game resources and source code of Getamped KR server...

So I'd like to know how to decrypt it myself.

Of course, there are several types of files in the game, So I don't know if it's enough to decrypt only the kar file.
But first, I want to decrypt the kar file.

I heard that this game is developed based on Java and JavaScript, but I'm not sure... 

Here is game download link:
http://getamped-windysoft.ktcdn.co.kr/client/Client/GetampedV2_F.exe


I would really appreciate it if someone could tell me how to get all the source code and resources for this game.

I hope someone can help me. Thank you.

You can't get original source code if it haven't leaked or wasn't shared by the developers.

You can try to decompile game executable, but it is a lot of work without debugging symbols.
Here you can find some tutorials explaining how to do it [viewtopic.php?f=29&t=22266](https://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=29&t=22266)
