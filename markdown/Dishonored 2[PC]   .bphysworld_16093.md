Hello guys. After searching in vain in the game files for the buildings, vegetation and skybox models (aka the map assets) of Dishonored 2, I found some files in a format I've never seen before (it must be a new format created specifically for the Void engine) that seems to be containing what I'm looking for. I'm wondering if anyone here can look into the sample I linked to see if it :

-can be decrypted and opened
-contains the maps assets

I have absolutely no experience whatsoever about what you guys are doing over here so I would be grateful if someone can help me out.

Here's the sample : [https://mega.nz/#!YQkHUTgZ!qUAnsMgCbj4z ... AHkKA7yw7g](https://mega.nz/#!YQkHUTgZ!qUAnsMgCbj4zZNW7zkaq9n8WXIA5mPZd-AHkKA7yw7g)

Have a nice day/night and thanks in advance.

On first sight the it seems like the start of the file looks like this:

```
    for(FileStringCount)
        UInt32 StringLength;
        char[StringLength] String;

    UInt32 UnknownCount;
    for(UnknownCount)
        UInt32 Unknown

```

Is anybody interested in looking further into this? I'm also after the building models, the majority are missing at the moment.

Any help would be appreciated.
