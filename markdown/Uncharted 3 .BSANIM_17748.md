- Post Title: Uncharted 3 .BSANIM

Anybody have any luck reverse engineering the BSANIM format from UC3, or even better, UC4? The Uncharted series, especially the newer couple, have some brilliant animations. Here's some example animations: [https://www.dropbox.com/s/ixsf1arocxvi8 ... s.zip?dl=1](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ixsf1arocxvi8ag/drake%20files.zip?dl=1)
Not entirely sure what Uncharted game they're from, I didn't rip those myself, but I'm guessing UC4 from the sword model I found.


Thanks,
