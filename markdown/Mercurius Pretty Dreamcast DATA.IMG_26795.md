- Post Title: Mercurius Pretty Dreamcast DATA.IMG

Hi!

I'm trying to translate a game called "Mercurius Pretty" for the Dreamcast. I've been asking around various sites trying to get the main file, a 1 GB "DATA.IMG" file cracked open. A very smart chap was able to crack it open, to an extent, but the result was about 15K files that I have no idea how to work with due to a lack of directory structure or compression scheme. Here is a link to the file. If anyone can help get this to someth8ing workable, I would greatly appreciate it.


Link is ded. Couldn't find a reasonable way to extract.

A bridge too far, I gather?

Here is the quickbms script that was initially created by BloodRaynare. Anyone up to improving it?
