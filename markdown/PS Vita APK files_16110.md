Wondering if anyone has any idea how to decompress these. Naturally I first attempted basic archive extraction but they aren't that kind of APK. The game in question I'm looking at myself is Puella Magi Madoka Magica The Battle Pentagram for a friends daughter's modding request. Thanks in advance for any help.

* solved, thanks!

Not a huge revelation but I found the PSP game has an alike directory and naming structure and it's files are CPK's which extract with the bms script and/or CriPakTools. Hopefully that helps to narrow it down.
