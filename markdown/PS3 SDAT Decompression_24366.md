- Post Title: PS3 SDAT Decompression

Hi everyone,
I was trying to work with PS3 SDAT format, I tried decrypting it using a tool developed by aniruddh22 ([https://github.com/aniruddh22/make_npdata](https://github.com/aniruddh22/make_npdata)) that seams to have worked, but then and stumble upon the fact that I can't really open or even analyze it. I don't know the extension of the output file it generates and what tools should I use to work with it.
I was wondering if any of you guys have some experience/knowledge in working with these files and could give some insight if this is the right path and what tools there is for the job?

Any help will be greatly appreciated
