- Post Title: Skullgirls .art files assets (and xbox's .art in general)

I've recently discovered a huge number of the game's graphics are stored in files with file extensions .art and .art-pt (probably also .foit, but I've not been able to identify any connection between them), yet all AOL ART supporting programs don't seem to even recognize said files. I am fairly sure they're not corrupted either, as all other files in the directory seems to be working perfectly with other picture viewers.

So what I'd really like to ask you much more techno savvy people than poor ol' technophobe me, is there any particular way to crack open these? I'm assuming they contain multiple files, so converting is a secondary problem right now, but if it were possible, how am I to do that?
(I can upload said files if people were interested in looking at them more directly, although is it allowed?)

I'm assuming this is a general problem for a lot of other sprite-oriented games supported on xbla as well.
