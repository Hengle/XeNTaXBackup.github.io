idea what to do with it. Please help!It's a python script for blender. Learn how to install scripts for blender - there's no way around and there's dozens of posts on many sites where they explain how to do it.

Some .py scripts don't need to be installed - they just can be run in a blender text window.
The magic key is ALT-P (executes the text as a python script).
