Hi mate,

I do not know - maybe I wrote the plugin from a demo archive, or for the game on another platform such as XBox - usually this is the case. I will have a look.

I found out why it didn't work - Game Extractor did not have support for the *.pkr files from this game, only some of the other archives.

I took a look at the archive you attached, but the directory is absolutely huge. I will need you to do another File Cutter of the archive if you want us to look at it some more - instead of choosing a file size like 2MB, just type in the value 5500000 and click the "Cut/OK" button. It will make a large zip, but we will only need the "back" and "info" files, so if you want you can delete the "front" file from the ZIP if you want.

Thanks for this  This is by far the largest directory I have seen in an archive.

The specs of this data file do not match those at the wiki, right?

The wiki specs are correct, for the game that I wrote the specs for. It appears as though there might be 2 different PKR_PKR3 formats because the archive that was attached above was substantially different to the other PKR3 format.

So not, the wiki is correct, its just that we read the PKR3 header and thought maybe they were the same format - but they are not. I still need to get a larger cut of this file to proceed any further though - I've never come across an archive with a directory over 2MB before!

Kornet, can you cut the last 10 mb somehow from that archive you attached?

Please, give the working reference to a plug-in Plugin_PKR_PKR3!

And that http://rapidshare.de/files/9823410/data.pkr.zip.html Does not work!

That's because we were talking about this in 2005. There may be a working plugin now, I don't know. If you have the game, then upload an example like Watto suggested in the posts before.
