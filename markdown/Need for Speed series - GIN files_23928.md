- Post Title: Need for Speed series - GIN files

Hi everyone,

I'm new to this forum. And I continue to learn English. I know little about game culture and these terms. For this reason, if I have provided missing information, please let me know, I will add more details.

I examine NFS games as to how these big games are create. Sound is my interest and I love the sounds of these car's engine sound.

I extracted the assets of NFS 14 with [1].
Since the sounds I'm interested in are car engine sounds, I'll just view them.

Everything ok. The script works great and has extracted 23 cars.

Here they are: "assets\Audio\Cars\CarEngine"

CarEngine the folders there is a folder called GinsuData.

I think the engine RPMs are in these files.

Here is an example and the general folder structure:
name - size
VEH_BMW_M3_GTS_ENG_Decel_Close_WithPOVMixed_NiD.gin - 298 KB
VEH_BMW_M3_GTS_ENG_HighLoadAccel_Close_WithPOVMixed_NiD.gin - 246 KB

I share 2 file names so that there is no more confusion. For example, there are sps files in the Idle folder.
There are 6 files in the same order in each folder.

Download link where you can view the folder [2]. There are other files than GIN files. 

There is an old tool for GIN file format. I took it out with the [3].

It gives me the WAV file. And there is no problem with Wav [4].

But this is an accelerated sound. There is not only acceleration, but also slowing sounds in the folder. But there is no constant RPM.

All the engine sounds like this. No 5-6 RPM sounds in ABK files as in NFS 2005.

What I don't understand and wonder is how do they produce a constant sound out of these non-constant sounds? These sounds are moving, decreasing or increasing pitch regularly, almost every millisecond.

I also examined the GTA 5 sound assets; there are also the same files inside the NPC folders. constant RPM files. But GTA 5 also has constant RPMs.
But there is no constant RPM in the new NFS games.

What is the math here? I really want to understand this engineering.

How can I get other constant RPM sounds if I'm looking at wrong files?


I ran these trials with Need for Speed ​​Rivals.

I am grateful for every answer.
