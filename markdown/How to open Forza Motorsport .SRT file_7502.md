- Post Title: How to open Forza Motorsport .SRT file

Hi all,
i am trying to create my personal Forza cars database, i could open the SQLite DB but the car's names are missing, cos they are localized for each country.
I found those files in the StringTable folder, they are in a .SRT format but i don't know how to open them. 
Opening them with an hex editor, i could read some of the cars name so the files are correct but i don't know how to read them correctly..

I tried to search on the forum and the web but unsuccesfully..

It's pretty pointless.
I mean, what's the deal?
These files you want to open them have no meaning in the forza editing.

But the srt could probably be some subtitles formats.
Like subtitles for Divx movies.
The Autovista have subtitles in xml formats.
Likely when Jemery Clarkson talk about shit when in Autovista mode.

I think you misunderstood.. i would like to get all cars NAMES and SPECS, there is a Database with all the SPECS but the "DisplayName" is not there, there's something like a referral to something else, and i thought it could have something to do with language localization and it's like that. 
So basically i would like to "extract" also the list of the cars NAMES and that list is on the .STR file (that is not an .SRT, i know these are subtitles), but i don't know which format is this.. that's all
