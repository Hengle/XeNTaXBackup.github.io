- Post Title: UE3 ini & localization decrypt help

Hello forum,

Game name: AVA (Unreal Engine 3)

1. When I was looking for related articles, I saw the tool about the similar decryption ([viewtopic.php?t=6986](https://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?t=6986)), but the method is unknown since it is not open-source. They are all the same engine. (I especially want to decrypt is ini, the game only gives some parameters to be modified). Can someone make a tool to encrypt or decrypt the above files?

2. Is it possible encrypt the ini or localization files after decrypted?

Here is the game executable file & encrypted ini & localization files:

Thanks.
