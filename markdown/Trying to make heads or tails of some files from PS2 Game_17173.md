- Post Title: Trying to make heads or tails of some files from PS2 Game

I'm working on making a translation for the Jojo Golden Wind ps2 game and have hit a brick wall. I've found some literal txt files that can just be modified and replace the text for certain scenarios but it seems I can't find any more. 
file extensions are: .hit, .bin, .pzz, and .snd every other file i've encountered in the game has been identified as an afs archive or an adx sound file. can anyone help?
