Hello everyone,

Sorry to bring up an older subject, but I'm new here and I couldn't find a clear anwser to this when searching the forums. Anyway, for the last 6 days I've been scouring the internet for a way to get models from this game and this forum seemed to be my best hope.

I've used Noesis to extract files from the .asf files, but all I get then is .file files.
I found this topic: [viewtopic.php?p=65436#p65436](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?p=65436#p65436)
As well as this one: [viewtopic.php?p=65444#p65444](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?p=65444#p65444)
But I still have no idea how he got the model.

All I'm really looking for is exporting the 3 dragon models and their textures from this game.

Thanks in advance for any help!

A shame no one anwsered this except for Ares who send a PM. It would appear that even the elite around here have not found a way to get the models. Ares is still trying around with the files. If he has any luck *crosses fingers* I'll post it here. If anyone else has any ideas I'd be happy to hear it.
