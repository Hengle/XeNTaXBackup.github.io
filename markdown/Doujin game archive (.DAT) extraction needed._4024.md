- Post Title: Doujin game archive (.DAT) extraction needed.

Hello again fine folks. Today I'm workign to extract some graphics from a Doujin game called "Bunny Must Die" or, to those have played through the whole game, "Chelsea and the Seven Devils". This is one of my favorite doujin games and I was hoping someone here was knowledgeable enough to figure out how to unpack the data files, which seem similar in comparison to the Touhou game files. The game utilizes packed .DAT files for graphics and .OGG files for music. The .OGG I'm fine with, and have a player and converter for, it's the .DAT files that present the problem. As with most gaming .DAT files, they're somewhat exclusive to this company's format, and are packed differently from others. I've tried to unpack them via other unpackers, but haven't had any luck, and web searches yield little to no results, and most of them are completely irrelevant. I believe the files will contain both graphic files and sound files, as the sound effects of the game are not separate files, thus, one would conclude that they are packed within these files. I assume they're similar to touhou's type in that manner.

Here is an example of the files. This one I believe to contain the majority of the graphics.

Once again, I believe these to contain both graphic and sound files of some sort. If we manage to unpack this file, and the files within are in some obscure format, I may carry on this thread rather than creating a new one.

I've xor-ed bmd0.dat with 0xFF and then load it into [FileStripper](http://turvy.dommel.be/FileStripper.rar).
I've got 9 PNG files.

Wow! That's incredible? Send me a PM with detailed instructions on how to do so if you find the time. I have a few other files of the same type from the same game that I'd like to extract.
