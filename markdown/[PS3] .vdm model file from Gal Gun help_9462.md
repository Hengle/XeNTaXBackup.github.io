I've been looking for a way to open the .vdm model files in ps3 gal*gun but no result ;w; Please help me with this, here're some files sample: [http://www.mediafire.com/?egtabuwjju2bdsv](http://www.mediafire.com/?egtabuwjju2bdsv)
I'm really grateful if someone will help, thanks for looking at this btw.

(I know there's a xbox version of this but when I exported textures, the hair and eyes always get swizzled or look like broken.)
