Really? Playable Teaser which was just on PS4 was recently cracked and some content was dumped. If i remember it was by luxox or someone else.


Unless you mean getting the actual demo, which i remember people backed up their P.T demo files.

ps4 demo pkg's are useless without the decryption key stored on the console that is impossible to get for new games.
PT was able to be decrypted because it was on a vulnerable firmware where they could extract those keys.
