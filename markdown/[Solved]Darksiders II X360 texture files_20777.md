- Post Title: [Solved]Darksiders II X360 texture files

Hi,

Are there any tool or script to view and modify these swizzled xtx files?

Thank you

Update:

You can change the XTX header (0x1B long) to TEX header (0x34 long) with (texture format=52 and 0x1c offset=90) and drag & drop the new file to the nfs_xtx_to_tga program.
