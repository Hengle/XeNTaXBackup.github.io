- Post Title: Justice League Heroes (PS2) - death timer

Hey, I was wondering if I could edit the scripts for justice league heroes for PS2 emulator. I have used quickbms and worldexplorer to edit the files, but I can't seem to find which file has the data. I'm running this mission on superhero difficulty and I'm doing just one route speed run. When my whole team dies, I can't skip the whole delay of view on my wish. So I just want to speed up the death timer, but I can't find the exact file that says about the gamedata because the gamedata itself contains just the stats for the characters, not the scripts of the mission and I went in to the episodes to change and find the fade out, but I couldn't find it, so if there is anyone who can help me. First thing I want to fix is this death timer and the rest is the manipulation of time limits. Thank you for reading!!!
