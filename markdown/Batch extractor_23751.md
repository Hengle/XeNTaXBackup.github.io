- Post Title: Batch extractor

Hi, I got all .segm from B2S files
Now I want extract them, is there a way to do it with a sort of .Bat file? I want  convert all them in one click
I tried creating a .bat file myself but no luck
here what I wrote:

> @echo off
>
> 
>
> b2s_DC.exe C:\Users\zagor\Desktop\TrueAncestor_EDAT_Rebuilder_v1.65\*.segm
>
> 
>
> echo done!

Use something like these lines
@echo off
for %%f in (*.segm) do b2s_DC.exe %%f

in a .bat or .cmd file.

If you execute it in the *.segm folder there should be no worries with path names assumed the exe to be in said path.
Else try for %%f in (C:\Users\zagor\Desktop\TrueAncestor_EDAT_Rebuilder_v1.65\*.segm) do b2s_DC.exe %%f

(Couldn't test this so don't blame me.)
