- Post Title: So, does your program kill MSIE in W98 or purpose or not?

Maybe it takes too much thought process to notice simple problems such as OS incompatibilities? Is THAT is why your program is not distributed as simply a packed archive but as a setup that has to be run, and that will then overwrite W98's oleaut32.dll v2.40.4517 with your incompatible oleaut32.dll v3.50 from Winblows XcraP, causing MSIE to stop working in W98? Or do you do it on purpose? Is it a lack of thinking and competence, or deliberate maliciousness?

Here are some Usenet posts from victims of this syndrome:

Either distribute the installer as a normal, packed, manually extractable archive, or REMOVE THE DAMN MS SYSTEM LIBRARIES FROM THE SETUP AND MAKE IT CONTAIN ONLY THE PROGRAM FILES!

Well, well Davey, as much as I can understand your annoyance, we tested it on various running W98 systems and they seemed not to have any problems, all running with the latest service packs. 

Yet, that is no garantee for succes, obviously. 
If that ole did do that, than we're sorry it happened, but we cannot forsee all troubles, especially since test-machines not seemed to have the problem you describe. And there's only so much what we can do for people like you, however much we'd like to. But in any event :

A. Time is not on my hands, I do have work to do, and this is a hobby
B. The time that is spend on the tool is enormous, and I get nothing in return
C. By installing the program you agreed not to take us accountable for any problems that arise AFTER the installation. No, I don't want to run away for responsibility, but this is the bare fact, and we have these terms, because we cannot forsee all manner of errors. Still, you have every right to come complain. But your tone is not the right one. 

So, in the future, just don't install it again, and you will be save from our devious plans to destroy all WIN98 systems still up and running. But only just.

Don't tell him about our secret plans man!

And for the love of God, don't mention plan B, in which we force-install our pictures along with the words 'OBEY THE EVIL XENTAX GODS' to all win98 backgrounds.
