- Post Title: Metal Gear Solid 3 HD Collection PS3  Localization to PT-BR

Hi everyone, i start translate this game for my location "PortuguÃªs-Brazil"
In HD Collection this game, Bluepoint not encrypeted most files.
So the translation is being done from Spanish, and after decompress mgs3.psarc I found in the SP folder a file responsible for translating the game's menus, weapons, items and tutorials.
But I can't edit this file because it has the .gcx extension

can anybody help me?
I will attach the file for analysis.
