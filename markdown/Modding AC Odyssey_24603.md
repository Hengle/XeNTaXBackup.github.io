Not sure if this is the right place to ask, however I'd like to modify kassandra's body texture as well as the head mesh with my own head mesh I modeled. If I can't do the head mesh could I replace a helmet or something? Any help would really be appreciated. It seems tools for it are scattered everywhere and some are dead links now.
