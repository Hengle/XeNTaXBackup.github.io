- Post Title: Demon's Souls PS5 Texture Files (*.ctxr)

Hello!!I have here some sample textures from the PS5 remake of Demon's Souls and they are in the format of .ctxr

I tried opening some with RawTex but there seems to be some swizzling there so can anyone help please?

The folders have a ctxr file and other ctxc files with the same name but ending with chunk#

The file includes color, mask, emissive, mud, normal, and roughness maps

Afaik, ps5 is using oodle texture compression natively for all BC formats, like swizzling in case with ps3/ps4. Even though this stuff is more or less open source now thanks to Epic Games (not really open, but still), I didn't hear about actual implementation in a standalone tool.

Yes but how can we know how it is done exactly?
