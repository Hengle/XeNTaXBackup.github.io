- Post Title: Zone 4 .Sod?

These files are for zone 4 however I have no clue what these files are.. A music file will play but the SFX files will not for some odd reason.

A file that works:

A file that doesn't work:

I want to try and convert the non-working files into working ones.

I wonder what the files are as the non-working files don't work in any audio program.
