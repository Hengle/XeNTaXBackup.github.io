- Post Title: Rocket League - Decrypt Coalesced_INT.bin

Hi everyone,
I was wondering if anyone has managed to figure out a way to decrypt the Coalesced_INT.bin files for Rocket League.
Coalesced_INT.bin is an Unreal Engine 3 game file
I really want to know if there are any tools or other things available
