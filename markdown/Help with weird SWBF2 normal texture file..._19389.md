- Post Title: Help with weird SWBF2 normal texture file...

Hey everyone! I'm wondering if someone here might be able to help me out with this normal from SWBF2. As far as I've seen so far, this is the only one like this -- I know that the Green layer is meant to be different to the red, but here they're the same. Does anyone know how to fix this?
