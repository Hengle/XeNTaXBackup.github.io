i think you must use a program called intrinsic alchemy game engine (the program sega used to make project diva)
here is the website [http://www.siliconstudio.co.jp/middlewa ... index.html](http://www.siliconstudio.co.jp/middleware/alchemy/index.html)
i hope this could help because this is the only program that can ope .igb file

Yeah, I see... this is the only way to open the igb files, but I don't have any access to the download, it needs a password =\
How did you managed to get this password Julinha? =P

Ugh... Everyone is getting the same error =\
I think it happens because the download is a trial version of the software.
But just one question. Have someone tried to open the 1st project diva igb, yet?

Hey guys! I discovered what's wrong!
Here it is: If you notice the DEMO version of Alchemy DOES NOT support model physics, so this means that the only skins that will open are those non-physical models (like Len's face).

No. They cannot be opened in MAX. I am working on an exporter for LW but mapping 120+ scene graph nodes is not a very fun thing to do. I can only do two or three at a time before getting really bored lol.

I see.... And do you know how to remove the physics of the model, with a script, or something like that?
