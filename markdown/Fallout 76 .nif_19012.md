- Post Title: Fallout 76 .nif

Fallout out 76 .nif files dont work with the current noesis script (some only import the armature, some give a 'list index out of range')
here have a sample: [https://drive.google.com/open?id=12g05a ... nV7mpuUFV0](https://drive.google.com/open?id=12g05a5vx5BrLjlQdsXvqOpnV7mpuUFV0)

yeah, what a monster of a script!  You'll have to wait 'til someone patches it for FO 76.
Meanwhile u could try out hex2obj (view links in my sig):

Hot damn, this is great! 

I do wonder if it's possible to export rigged models, though?

fallout 4 used a dds image to generate the landscape, It's probably still the same.

The blender and noesis script is out of date from importing the .nif files, However NifSkope 2.0 Dev can open and export the models as .obj [https://github.com/jonwd7/nifskope/rele ... /v2.0.dev8](https://github.com/jonwd7/nifskope/releases/tag/v2.0.dev8)
