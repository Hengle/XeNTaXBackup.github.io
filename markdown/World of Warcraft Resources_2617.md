- Post Title: World of Warcraft Resources

Some of you might know me, I run a fairly well known site which contains most of the information needed for someone to datamine World of Warcraft.

I haven't had much time to keep it updated lately or even watch over it. I wandered over here the other day when someone posted a link for me, and I noticed you guys had quite a few active members which work on similar things.

I'm curious as to if XeNTaX or anyone here would be interested in taking over the wiki (in administration) or migrating the data here/vice versa.

The website is [http://www.sourcepeek.com/](http://www.sourcepeek.com/)

Sorry we haven't responded before, busy busy. We would certainly be happy to migrate your info to Game File Format Central. We should take this up with Dinoguy1000, please contact him as well, or perhaps he reads this.  Excellent idea!
