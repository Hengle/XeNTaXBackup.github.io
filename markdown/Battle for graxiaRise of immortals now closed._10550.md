Hello. I just understood that Battle for graxia was closed... (R.I.P.) And I was wondering does anyone still have the files of the game (the installed game client) on their HDD? And if so could they be bored to upload it for me? I'm interested in the models and the textures of the game.
However if this post violates the rules of this community, please just contact me via Pm.
Thanks in advance.
