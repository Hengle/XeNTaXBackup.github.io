I'm a newbie to the field of 3d file format reversing and parsing.So i've decided that i'll start with a known format first.
I have all the details i need about a format.Details like Offset of Vertex data,normals,indices section,u-v offset,number of meshes,vertex count,face data info and all.

So what i want to do is to convert the meshes into the wavefront obj format.I know that i won't get much help.

So what should i do with the vertex and the normals data.How do i convert them into wavefront obj?

I know that normals can be auto generated by any 3d tool,but what i wanna know is how can i convert the vertex data in the model file and also the u-v data to wavefront obj,should i convert those to floats first?

Number of vertices per mesh is 160(A0 in hex)

So should the vertex data be split according to number of meshes in the model file?

Do you want to do it by script?
If so, which script? Maxscript? Python script? (Noesis or Blender)

If you don't know how to script then the simplest approach would be using hex2obj, imho.

I'm learning blender scripting currently.

That's great!  
There's a tutorial on xentax, in case you didn't know:
[http://wiki.xentax.com/index.php/Blender_Import_Guide](http://wiki.xentax.com/index.php/Blender_Import_Guide)

(Keep this in mind: "Also note that Blender 2.4 uses Python 2, Blender 2.5 and above use Python 3."
So scripts are not interchangeable, you'll have to adapt them.)
