- Post Title: Noesis XML export

here is a plugin to export the noepy format to xml. I will add better material support and texture support when i figure out how to call them back from a model.
This is an example of how to export a model from noesis to an xml format based on the sample noepy format included in noesis.
if anyone has any questions or any suggestions for improvements let me know. I plan to show how to read it back into noesis also soon.
this is the tutorial that got me started.
