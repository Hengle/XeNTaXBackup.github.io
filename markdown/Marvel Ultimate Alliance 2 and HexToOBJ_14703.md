- Post Title: Marvel Ultimate Alliance 2 and HexToOBJ

Very new to all this so please forgive me if this has been answered well elsewhere.  Currently in the process of trying to convert the .igz files in MUA2 to usable OBJs or some other format.  To do so I used QuickBMS to go from .bin archives to .igz files (which apparently somehow store both model and texture in a single format?) and from .igz to uncompressed .dat files.  To start off I'm working on the Black Panther model (1101.igz in the actors.bin archive.)

The problem I'm having is figuring out how to configure HexToOBJ to make the file usable.  I know in another thread AceWell and Pechenko121 were working on the Deadpool model, but I was struggling to follow along since I'm still trying to learn how to "read" hex files.  Any advice would be much appreciated
