It's been years since you posted this query, did you ever find an answer?

I know that using the UnleashX dashboard you can view the content when the file, title_logo.pk2, is renamed to title_logo.xpr.

I'm not sure if it's view the entire set of textures or only the first one it finds.

Oh and there's this PC app - [xprextract2.rar](http://www.the-eye.eu/public/xbins/XBOX/PC%20Based%20Applications/editors/_Game%20Editors/xprextract/xprextract2.rar).
