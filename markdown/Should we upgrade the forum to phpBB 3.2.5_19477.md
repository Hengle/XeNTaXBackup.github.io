Hi everyone, 

A quick poll to ask you XeNTaX members if you are okay with upgrading the forum to phpBB 3.2.5 (the latest).
This means the style will become Prosilver, and I may not be able to retain the Thanks for Posts functionality. 

However, it will add a heap of other stuff and fix some longstanding issues. 

Let me know in the poll!

If you vote "no", it would help if you also leave a comment explaining your reasoning a bit better.

From a security perspective, I think the forum should be upgraded regardless; the only reason we haven't been pwned by a security exploit that was patched in some later version of phpBB is probably largely down to luck (though admittedly I haven't read through the changelogs for the releases between our version and the latest, so any patched security issues might be more theoretical than actual).

30years young and a new facelift, how nice is this, thank you for your continuum support and longevity of the forum gents.
I am proud to call this my home and to be able to spend time here when I can, and help with what I can other users as well.

Cheers.

Is there a reason why the connection appears to be not secure in Firefox?

I will say that, I prefer the old style, it was less common and more "xentax". Right now it look like way too generic and too bland.

Like we are used to say : " It was better before "

Yes, because users posted images that were uploaded at non-SSL locations. Since we have many posts here, there will always be posts that link to a site with http instead of https. We can force those URLs to link to https instead, but that will only work if those sites actually have https. 

So if you link to an image in your post from a site that is not secure, this forum will be marked as having Mixed Content. 
Basically the devs of Firefox think it is good to mark forums like this as Mixed Content with a warning, because someone posted a link to a non-secure site in a post. Thus, many forums have this warning. Of course, better browers would simply block malware appearing through an image and not nag about this, making a secure site look bad. On the other hand, we could probably force users to only post images when from a secure site. 
Oh well.

Yeah, if there are people willing to build a new template, let them step forward. It should be easily turned on or off, as a requirement.

I see. So long as there's no actual security issue it's fine with me. 
Thanks again for the clarification.

If you feel like it, you can always go through your old posts and check any images, updating them to HTTPS where possible (or reuploading them to a service with HTTPS support and updating the relevant post(s) accordingly). Obviously this won't make a huge difference, but it's still something, and anyone can do this with their own posts.

It's done.  
One problem remains though. I can't change what other users already quoted from my old posts.

If there're some tricks that can help users locate to those posts easier, maybe they'll have more desire to do it. Otherwise it would be a huge pain to figure out in which post one could ever placed an insecure link.

Do we still have access/picture from the old theme ?

I never made a template with PHPbb before, but I'm a web developer, so I don't think it will be that much of a trouble. ( I can already make a stylus addon script if needed. )

Aah, good point... If I had a good handle on how the report system works, I would suggest to report those posts so  mod could update the link(s) in them (this would also work for any other posts). However, if reporting impacts the poster's account in some way (e.g. if we had a karma system, and reported posts counted as negative karma), this wouldn't work so well.

There's none I'm aware of, unfortunately. It's somewhat easier if the person hasn't posted many images over time, but that'll be small consolation to active image posters who want to help clean up their own post history. At least you can view all of your posts from your profile... kind of. phpBB just isn't designed for this type of thing.

Your best bet would be probably to see what's available on the Internet Archive; that way, you could grab the actual HTML/CSS instead of just having to recreate the appearance from screenshots.

Since the old quotation format doesn't include any identity info like a post id, I guess it'd be really difficult to accomplish it automatically. Maybe we can just ask the users who quoted those links to remove them from their posts, as an image in a quote is not necessary and unsightly.

Actually, I could think of one. If you access to all your posts from your profile, you can search within your posts for the keyword "http:" or the domain name of the host where you placed these images. But since "http" is marked as a too common word by the search query, some adaptions to the searching rules is required.

However there's more circumstances to worry about if we're to promote this movement, like users who have been inactive for a very long time and could had abandoned their accounts. Besides, is it all about links to images? Waht about http links to web pages? If it's the former case I think the final antidote for a full cleansing would be forcing those URLs to link to https.

True, completely forgot about that.

The insecure content warning is only related to content that's actually served to the browser in the process of displaying the page. So in addition to the page itself, it warns for any CSS or JavaScript files that are embedded but served over HTTP, as well as any images or other content files. Since nothing more is loaded for them, though, it isn't affected by ordinary links to other pages, so HTTP links are fine. (Though of course, if you want to update HTTP links in your posts to HTTPS as well, no one will stop you.  )

I was doing a bit of research, and I found this :

[SubSilver for 3.2.5](https://www.phpbb.com/customise/db/style/allan_style_subsilver/)

[DEMO](https://www.phpbb.com/customise/db/style/allan_style_subsilver/demo/3.2)

Just need then to add the [banner](https://imgur.com/a/YwU06hm) and the [background](https://imgur.com/a/9GgghdU).

Seems to be a quick way to get back the old style.
