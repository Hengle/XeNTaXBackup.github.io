Does anyone over here have a clue regarding building / rebuilding .asr/.en/.pc archives for this game? Extraction has been made possible thanks to a few, but what about building these type of archives? I have tried several methods to get around having to compress for this game, but no dice.

Now recently I've encountered a post that had ".en" files for this game linked. [http://forums.sega.com/showthread.php?t=336970](http://forums.sega.com/showthread.php?t=336970)
So it IS possible to make mods for this game as there is an archive builder for this game out there.
Anyone willing to share his / her 2 cents perhaps his / her tool or program?
