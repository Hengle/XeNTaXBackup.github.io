I have been trying to use Dolphin with 3dRipper and Ninjaripper but after setting everything up the wiimote Emulation fails for whaterver reason. Is there anyway to still rip these files and is there someone who could help with that?

in dolphin emulator, in video settings, you have to choose render mode direct3d11 or 9, in ninja ripper in intruder mode do the same d3d11 or 9 also in ninja ripper assign the hotket f10 to capture
