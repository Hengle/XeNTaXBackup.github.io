- Post Title: Star Wars TOR - .jba Animation Format

Hi all, I was wondering if someone might be able to take a look at TOR's .jba animations and put together a script to go with Zaramot's skeleton .gr2 importer. While the .gr2 models have been pretty well researched, I haven't been able to find much on the animation format. I've been trying to figure some of it out myself, but after a couple of days of feeling pretty good about my odds, it occurred to me that everything I've found so far probably amounts to about a five minute cursory exam by a trained eye. Since I'm still new to hex, I'm sure I have no business looking at a file like this yet.

[Here are some sample files](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/64418935/TORAnims.zip), a rigged character model (gr2), its skeleton (gr2), and a couple of jba animations.

Zaramot [posted a script](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=7186&hilit=swtor&start=255) (third post down) last year for importing bones from skeleton .gr2s into max, so the animations could be loaded after that with another script.

Any pointers or tips in the right direction you could offer me would be appreciated, too. Thanks guys!
