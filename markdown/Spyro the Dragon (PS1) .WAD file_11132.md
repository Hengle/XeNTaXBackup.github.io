- Post Title: Spyro the Dragon (PS1) .WAD file

So I was thinking of extracting character models from the first Spyro game on the PlayStation, and I do know that the .WAD file on the disc stores data used in the game. Problem is, I dunno what format Spyro uses for its character models. If anyone would like to help, let me know.
