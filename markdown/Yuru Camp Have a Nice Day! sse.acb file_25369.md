It plays fine in foobar2000 with vgmstream plugin.

You don't have to extract it. You only need to drag and drop your ACB file to foobar's window.

You probably using some outdated version of the plugin. My version is r1721 [https://imgur.com/a/SiyaPMy](https://imgur.com/a/SiyaPMy)
Here is direct download link for this version [https://github.com/vgmstream/vgmstream/ ... -component](https://github.com/vgmstream/vgmstream/releases/download/r1721/foo_input_vgmstream.fb2k-component)
Please update your plugin.


And here you will find newest one which currently is r1745 [https://github.com/vgmstream/vgmstream/ ... /tag/r1745](https://github.com/vgmstream/vgmstream/releases/tag/r1745)
You can update foobar as well. My foobar's version is v1.6.10


Then try once again with drag and drop and it should work fine.
