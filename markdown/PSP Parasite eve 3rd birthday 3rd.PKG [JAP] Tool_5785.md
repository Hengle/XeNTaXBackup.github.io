This tool will extract the .png .at3 .pmf files out of the 3rd.pkg from parasite eve 3rd birthday [jap]to a folder then you can downsapmle, the the tool will
Inject the files back in and also pad the file to the original size,but will skip it if its too big!!you must replace the file with the same format and type i.e
at3 file with an at3 file.

1.so extract the folder put your 3rd.pkg into the same folder and run the extract_3rd.pkg.bat this will extract all the .png .at3 .pmf.
then downsample but keep the same name,but if the files are bigger it will not be added.
2.run the update_3rd.pkg.bat this will then inject the files back in!!
3so when you cso your iso it will be smaller!!

Is there a way I can get this to work with the USA version? I've been trying but no luck.
