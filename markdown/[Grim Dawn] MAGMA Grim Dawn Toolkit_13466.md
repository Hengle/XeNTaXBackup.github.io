- Post Title: [Grim Dawn] MAGMA Grim Dawn Toolkit

First I'd want to clarify why I'm starting this thread. There are two main reasons: 1) to give back the knowledge I've gathered from the content created in this forum, by its members and 2) to thank atom0s (https://forum.xentax.com/memberlist.php ... le&u=46635) for his and his associates' work in reversing the ARC and ARZ file formats used in Grim Dawn.

What is MAGMA Grim Dawn Toolkit?
The project aims to create unofficial modding tools for Grim Dawn.
It currently includes:

GDLib: C#/.NET library that provides means to work with Grim Dawn content and database files. It can be used in other people's projects with little effort.
GD Explorer: C#/.NET application backed by GDLib. Its purpose is to enable modders to work directly with the game's content and database files.
Please also note that the project is still in a very early stage and may not be what you are looking for.

Where can it be obtained?
The source code is available at GitHub - [https://github.com/darkalemanbr/MagmaGrimDawnToolkit](https://github.com/darkalemanbr/MagmaGrimDawnToolkit)
Binaries can be found here: [https://github.com/darkalemanbr/MagmaGr ... t/releases](https://github.com/darkalemanbr/MagmaGrimDawnToolkit/releases)

Why C#?
Because it has a good balance between performance, ease of use and features. In Windows, at least...
