Hi everyone. I found this folder inside a .pak file extracted from Final Fantasy VII Remake.pkg. Each font has 2 files: .uasset and .uexp. Please somebody guide me how to edit these files. I need to add my own characters that English alphabet doesnt have. Thank you.
Link download font folder: [http://www.mediafire.com/file/7r44i29ce ... t.rar/file](http://www.mediafire.com/file/7r44i29cepwq1pe/Font.rar/file)

You have to extract DDS files in Noesis, and after all edition, additionally, change info inside euxp. Let's say SystemFontLarge.uexp. Start in C0A for letter รง: 1495 pixels from left, 40 pixels from top, etc., almost exactly like in FFXV.
