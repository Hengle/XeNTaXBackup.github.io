- Post Title: [HELP] Final Fantasy Xii Zodiac Age [PC version] model extraction/conversion

hello there, so i am new to file ripping and such with games and this may be a long story but i feel like giving as much info as possible will help me skip unnecessary steps, and get me to my goal as soon as possible.

so i want to rip some enemy models from Final Fantasy XII Zodiac Age for PC. at first i tried NinjaRipper, i figured it'd be the quickest/easiest method.
well i got all the models i needed but for some reason ninja ripper couldnt grab the textures of, well, literally anything at all.
after talking in the XeNTaX Discord a bit i got a decent handful of help from a member on there, he hooked me up with a file extractor for the .vbf file the game comes compressed into. since Ninja Ripper wouldnt work it was time to crack my knuckles i suppose.
after some basic command prompt struggling (Not my most proficient skill) i was able to extract all the files i needed, Im assuming, since they are all in strange formats i cant open.
it seems as though most of the game files have been carried over from its original PS2 version in some way or another, anyhow the file extensions are .cm and .ca.
i did some searching but couldnt find any good info on these file types so i figured why not come to the forum i got the file extractor from, and well, here i am.

some additional info, the extracted files are very organised and it seems to be roughly 5-7 .ca files per .cm file with one .ca file being significantly larger than the rest. i tried using model viewers/converters like Noesis but they dont know this file type and i couldnt find any add-ons for them either.
my goal is to convert these files, which i strongly believe to be the model and texture files into .obj and .dds files to import into Tabletop Simulator for some games i play.
