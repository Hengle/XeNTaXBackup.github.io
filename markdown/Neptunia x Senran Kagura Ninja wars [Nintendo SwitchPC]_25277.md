Any plugin for .lds files? (texture files from PC version)

Edit: Nvm, QuickBMS with Tamsoft_GXT did the job.

Here it is, from the Shinobi Versus thread
[http://forum.xentax.com/download/file.php?id=10666](http://forum.xentax.com/download/file.php?id=10666)

I also realized some .dds files were corrupted, so i found this at least
[https://www.vg-resource.com/thread-4008 ... #pid671134](https://www.vg-resource.com/thread-40086-post-671134.html#pid671134)

It has all the files from the PS4 version, which uses .gcf for the textures instead (you can see them with Noesis).
