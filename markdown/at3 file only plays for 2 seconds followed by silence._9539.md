- Post Title: at3 file only plays for 2 seconds followed by silence.

The at3 has an SFH header (which I removed) but when converted to aa3, it only plays about 2-3 seconds until the sound just mutes out for the rest of the track. Hex shows that it looks like a standard atrac3plus file but I don't know if the SFH header has anything to do with the conversion not working correctly.

If U converting files from RE5(PSN) - better download BD-version...if this files from BH:CVX HD - converting isn't possible,since files bigger than 100 kb containing superfluous blocks.
