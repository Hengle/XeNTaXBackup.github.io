yes sir, like ive said before, the 

gundam.dat --> RobotWarsPSP.zip plugin for mexcom worked
and i've indicated the extracted files on it 

sorry if i've mislead you of not telling that i've successfully extracted it with the robotwars plugin. the one that failed though is the fileset.dat --> mexscript_robotwars_ps_fileset.zip via mexCom mexScript. 

thank you for the reminder though, because by that, i tried the other alternative which is sir aluigis quickbms, and it worked! it did extracted a bunch of file names with fileset+bins as names.

i did a hex check on one of the extracted files from it, sure enough theres indications of GMO data.



by the way this is a hexcheck on the original fileset.dat


i tried yet again mradults gitmo, but it doesnt recognize the gmo files .

thank you!

Hard to get my points across. because of my limited English.
Sorry. I have met similar problems.
Iâ€™m just looking...
I want to know, how to solve these problems.
In this field, I am as good as a beginner.
