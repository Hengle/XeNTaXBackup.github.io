- Post Title: Killzone 3 - Model request

Hey there, I'm working on a Left 4 dead 2 survivor pack, the rigging is going well so far, I plan on a survivor pack of the helghan leadership, consisting of Visari,Radec, Orlock and stahl.

I've got Visari, radec and stahl's model and textures. The only one I lack is orlock's, and i'm wondering if someone could be so kind to get it from the killzone 3's files, i've heard his model is hard to find and he's the only one that has not been ripped out of the main helghast characters, no downloadable model of orlock exists unlike the others i've got.

This is admiral orlock, the character i need extracted/ripped from the game.




Here is how the visari port to source is going so far if you're curious. Few bugs that I gotta have fixed though.

Hi, did you get the models out of Killzone 3?
