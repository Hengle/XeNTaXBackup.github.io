- Post Title: Using Noesis to view and export spell animations from FINAL FANTASY XI?

As far as I can tell, Noesis does not currently have the ability to load, preview, or export the animation effects for spells and abilities in FFXI, which is a real shame because some of the spell effects are pretty frickin' sweet. Is there anything that can be done about this?

Noesis can read bone animations, but spell effects are particle effects, I don't think noesis has any kind of particle system built in at all.
