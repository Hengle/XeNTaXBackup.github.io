- Post Title: Already friend of MultiEx...  How to download?

Hey,

So I registered my MultiEx a while back and the confirmation email that I have has my Serial Number and says that I'm a friend of MultiEx.  If I am already a friend of MultiEx, I should be able to download the new 4.5 version, right?  I can't seem to find a way to do that.  Any help would be appreciated since I reinstalled my computer and lost the MultiEx installer.  I still have my serial number and everything in the email, just no installer.

Thanks,
