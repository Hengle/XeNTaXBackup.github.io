- Post Title: Castlevania SFXs and more

Does anyone know a way of extracting sfxs from one of those games:
Castlevania Symphony of the night (PSX)
Castlevania Dracula X chronicles (PSP)
Castlevania Portrait of Ruin (DS)

Pirates Caribbean Legend of Jack Sparrow (PC/ps2) a good-ish game, nothing more if compared to the 1st listed, a masterpiece.

I've used Psound to get the sounds from SOTN before.

To get the cutscene dialogue and music you'll need jpsxdec

tried the psound thing on psp version. finds many sounds but apparently not the one I want.
on a side note, does anyone know a way of getting SFXs by gamecube game Eternal Darkness?
