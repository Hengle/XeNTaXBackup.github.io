- Post Title: Ridge Racer 7 ~ Car Textures ~ Samples included

So, I've been poking at a few textures and being wholly clueless on how they work. With a lot of the RR series being possible to unpack files now, it's a matter of figuring some stuff out, car models, done, textures... kinda? It's possible to export from the emulator if you can look at the car itself, which is somewhat useless if you don't have the car in question unlocked or available.

So, here I am, curious if anyone can figure out these textures.

I found an alternative, which is playing the game as intended (through an emulator), and use RenderDoc, how to use it, need like a few minutes, I haven't tried for stuff as vehicles with the car unlock cutscene that well (Trailers, Helicopters, the 2 for sepcials and courses), here's an example for in this case Danver Bass interior [https://imgur.com/a/dbAGJQz](https://imgur.com/a/dbAGJQz)
