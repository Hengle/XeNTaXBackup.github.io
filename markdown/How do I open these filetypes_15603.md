- Post Title: How do I open these filetypes?

I know that this seems like a dumb question but I've searched and searched on how I could possibly open .2ld, .img, .seb, .bin, and .bar files. I'm trying to extract the files to get the picture files from Kingdom Hearts 2. I mainly want to extract the character face icons from the game but can't figure out how to extract or find out which of those filetypes have them.
