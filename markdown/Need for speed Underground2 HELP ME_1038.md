Hey mate,

You should already be able to open BIG and VIV archives using MultiEx Commander - they are the same format as the FIFA games - these files are used heaps by EA, mostly for the FIFA games, Need for Speed series, and the latest Command and Conquer uses it too.

BTW, that GameExtractor archives.txt link is my list of archive formats - I think it would take a long time for Mr Mouse to implement all those 

Mr Mouse: You may want to bookmark that link to archives.txt because I update it whenever I work out some more formats - I wouldn't expect you to implement all those because it takes too long, but if anyone asks about a format then its a god place to start looking for information. Each format also has the tag in it, so if you get an archive with a header tag then just do a search for it and hopefully you will find it used in other games too

PS - It is the same for Hot Pursuit 2

The format is indeed the same as big, just different ID strings, see also two posts in the News section ( [viewtopic.php?t=1033](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?t=1033) ); he already figured it out for himself and the scripts have been implemented for the next release.
