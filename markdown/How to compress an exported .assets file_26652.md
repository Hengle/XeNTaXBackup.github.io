- Post Title: How to compress an exported .assets file?

Hi, so I've extracted an .assets Unity file using AssetRipper. I've done what I must do and now I do not know how to compress it back to .assets file. Do I have to compress the file back in order to see the differences I made or is there any other methods to do it?
