- Post Title: Midi Sequences in Games

This maybe sort of hard to explain but through the years looking through game music files I would comes across a few games that would have an single instrument file. 

Ex:

A Trumpet just blowing 1 note for about 4 seconds then fades away

A choir or "Ahhs" would play 1 note for about 4 seconds then fades away

An organ sound just plays 1 not for about 4 seconds

So I'm guessing there is a sequence these sound play from.

Here are samples I extracted from MegaMan Legends 1 and 2 so you get the idea.

So now I'm looking though Silent Hill 3 HD Collections sounds and found the music is just like that and so I'm my question is 
How can I view or convert the midi sequencer to view how it's being played? Also is it possible to view/convert from SNES games?

Here are the SH3 files [XBOX360]

One is a .BD which contains the single music sounds
One is a .HD which I have no clue what it is. Could be the sequencer file
One is a .SND I don't know how to listen to it or convert it. (IF YOU KNOW PLEASE TELL ME)
One is a .TD which I have no clue what it is. Could be the sequencer file
