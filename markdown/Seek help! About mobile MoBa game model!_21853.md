- Post Title: Seek help! About mobile MoBa game model!

Hello guys,I'm from China.
The whole paragraph is machine translated, which may not be smooth (because I am not proficient in English)    
This starts from one thing. I want to extract a model from a mobile MoBa game. The format is ". X2". 
At present, there is a decoder here, but there is still no way to open it. So I saw the post of bigchillghost, who introduced the tools of hex2obj. But his example is the Xbox 360 platform model.
When I open it with hexedit, its data is skewed and it's hard to find the rules.
I don't know how to use this tool to extract the mobile MoBa game model. Even if I follow the operation, I can only display a cube like interface.
Who can tell me what to do????
