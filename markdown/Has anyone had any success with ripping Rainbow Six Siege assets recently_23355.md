- Post Title: Has anyone had any success with ripping Rainbow Six Siege assets recently?

With this post, I wanted to ask if anyone has had success with ripping R6 assets recently without getting banned. I want to start tinkering with the in game operators but I don't want to risk my account while doing so. If you have any advice, please reply! TIA!
