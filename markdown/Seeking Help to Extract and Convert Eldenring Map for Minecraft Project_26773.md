Yo, I'm looking to create the Eldenring map (or at least a portion of it) in Minecraft. I need a method to extract the terrain files onto a 3D model. I can use Ninja Ripper to stitch the segments together, but I know that process will be time-consuming and perform poorly in Blender. My plan is to convert the 3D model from Blender to an MC Schem file. Is there a way to extract the terrain files separately from all the structures and load the entire map simultaneously for exporting to Blender as an OBJ file or FBX file? Alternatively, can I obtain a height map that I can convert into a 3D model? I also asked the people in the Ninja Ripper Discord server, and they directed me to this forum. I don't have much experience with extracting files from games or ripping models, but I really want to see how far I can take this project. I would greatly appreciate it if any of you could help me achieve this goal!
Many thanks,
Joffen

Giving example files goes a long way to getting someone to look at the project.
No example files? I'm not looking.
