- Post Title: Help Convert .tex files

Game : Cars Lightning league Android

So I have my 3d models that I got from the game.

So now it time to texture but the textures that I got from the .apk are bad , not detailed and low quality (except for Lightning & Mater).

I decided to look in the cache folder and open the _data with UnityEx and found the textures but in .tex and I don't know how to open or convert them.
