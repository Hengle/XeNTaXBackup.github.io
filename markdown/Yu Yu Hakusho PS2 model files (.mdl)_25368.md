- Post Title: Yu Yu Hakusho PS2 model files (.mdl)

I´ve been trying to extract models from the PS2 game Yu Yu Hakusho Dark Tournament for a while, best i found was a Blender 2.59 importer but the models come without UVs.

I wonder if anybody here knows a better method to get them, there´s a sample if anybody cares enough to take a look

(I think textures may be inside of the .mdl files too, but i can already get them using Ninja Ripper)

Thanks in advance.
