I noticed this thread by searching JB games.
anyway, in case you don't know it yet, the blur.bms script is valid for reimporting so you can use quickbms (latest version) to reinject the modified files back in the original archive.
read section 3 of quickbms.txt for the details.

this is valid also for the majority of other games for which exists a bms script.

I've tried here with all files with less size of the original ones and doesn't works. The tool return a message of zero files reimported.  I've used .bms script provided here:
[http://aluigi.altervista.org/papers/bms/blur.bms](http://aluigi.altervista.org/papers/bms/blur.bms) and lastes version of quickbms (0.5.2).

Can you check it?
