You may as well note what mistake you made for the future reference of others. I'll most likely try this in the future.

How to use OGLE?

I'm a noobs with the OGLE ( [http://members.chello.at/alexan/](http://members.chello.at/alexan/) ) too... but found this, Here a tutorial:

[http://make2d.blogspot.com/2010/07/3d-m ... earth.html](http://make2d.blogspot.com/2010/07/3d-models-from-google-earth.html)

For the PSP emulator you need download the Jpcsp ( [http://buildbot.orphis.net/jpcsp/](http://buildbot.orphis.net/jpcsp/) )and the "JPCSP Launcher" ( [http://www.emunewz.net/forum/showthread.php?tid=977](http://www.emunewz.net/forum/showthread.php?tid=977) ) because the OGLE only works with the .exe files.

Sadly i can't dump nothing for now, maybe i made some mistake, szfzafa what version of the JPCSP are you using?

jpcsp-2135-windows-x86

just go through every document alongwith OGLE to ensure it work;
and place opengl32.dll & gliConfig.ini in C:\Program Files\Java\jre6\bin\ .
never tried any JPCSP Launcher, i only start JPCSP with start-windows-x86.bat .

go through every document alongwith OGLE & OpenGLIntercept to learn it up instead.
i thought that was clear enough. i'm no more than a regular software user, neither know much about GL nor DLL hook. Come on!

Why don't u use jpcsp r2572 which have it own model ripper?it can export in .obj and it capture the whole world of game not only models in camera view	.
