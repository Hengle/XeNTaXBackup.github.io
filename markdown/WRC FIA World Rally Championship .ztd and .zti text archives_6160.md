your ZTD and ZTI files are the same except ZTI is big endian, ZTD is little. this does mean whoever writes this up can have it spit out 2 files, and either file can be used to edit!

the strings are grouped, and easy to parse. someone like bacter could write something up with this - and writing a BMS is sorta pointless as you want to repack etc etc

```
byte NULL[ 12 ]
short GROUPS
short UNKNOWN (only 1 in samples, but could be number of 'groups' in the file)
byte NULL[ 4 ]

-- 12 byte group headers

for i = 0 < GROUPS
{
  int STRINGS
  int HASH (similar base number between samples, probally using size&|groups, but unknown)
  int POS

  -- to get to POS
  goto 20 + POS + (i * 12)

  for j = 0 < STRINGS
  {
    long STRPOS (same calc to get to POS as with STRPOS, but can be ignored)
  }

  for j = 0 < STRINGS
  {
    unicode STR (null-terminated)
  }

}


```

so extracting menu.mix and comparing USENGLISH with the other languages shows me that the unknown 'checksum' value i gave the second header value is just a resource id! - it doesn't change with string length or with different characters. bah.

I can change characters in zti and ztd files but i donÂ´t know how to add any characters.
I uploaded some .zti and .ztd files in different languages and pack/unpack tools for .mix archives and guide for this tool

the characters are unicode but you're waiting for something which can adjust the string position headers
