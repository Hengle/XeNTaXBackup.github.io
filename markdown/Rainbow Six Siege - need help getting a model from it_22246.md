- Post Title: Rainbow Six Siege - need help getting a model from it

Okay so I tried, I couldn't figure it out, I'm stupid. I want to get the police car model from before the model update. It's the E3 Cavale from Watch Dogs with a different texture. If anyone can help me out, I'd greatly appreciate it.
