Indeed the .xvag audio files are problematic, if use vgmstream/test they get converted easily but they seemed to have made the audios unplayable to fully understand whats what.
Anyone found a solution to properly extract the .xvag sounds to .wav with out the distortions?

Its because he xvags use MP3 interleaved as there codec instead of Sony ADPCM. There was a thread here explaining on fionding the intelreave but its quite tedious process.
