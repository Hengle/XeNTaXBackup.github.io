Hello there,

I'm standing right in front of the same problem: I can't find a way (working AND virus-free) to take a look into those files from Metin2. But I plan on doing that for a different purpose - I need at least the 3D model of the good-old fashioned male warrior for conversion into XPS (if anyone in here knows that program). But the files seem to be the right one, since I got to tack it down to the files included in the 7z archive (there's also a pc2.eix/epk file combination in the same folder of the game).

So, does anyone in here have an idea on how to get these files open? Any help is really appreciated
