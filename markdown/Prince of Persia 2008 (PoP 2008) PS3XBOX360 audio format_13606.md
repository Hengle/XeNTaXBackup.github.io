- Post Title: Prince of Persia 2008 (PoP 2008) PS3|XBOX360 audio format

It would be nice if someone can extract audio propperly and describe struct for it's container (not .forge, but files extracted from .forge) to replace sounds. 

PS3 - [https://mega.nz/#!Ad4wDR4Z!g6vDmI-aZQ3m ... xdcFqtKHnk](https://mega.nz/#!Ad4wDR4Z!g6vDmI-aZQ3mbZJj9BfKbmg2qZILXVgcixdcFqtKHnk)
XBOX360 - [https://mega.nz/#!5QolSLSb!abrzBDmhgk1k ... d77q5J2zVQ](https://mega.nz/#!5QolSLSb!abrzBDmhgk1kPNXGf5Wa8Kuhh7SlSE2S2d77q5J2zVQ)

PS.
XBOX360 version seems to use XMA (you can even see bytes from xma header in each file extracted from .forge) and there is a tool from hcs, but i cant get it work.
