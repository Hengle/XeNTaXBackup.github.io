- Post Title: A few game support requests

These games are pretty old but some people still play them, including myself of course  , it would be nice if MultiEx could support them.

Star Control - PKG files
Star Control 2 - PKGs (Contains MOD music and internal SHPs) and possibly SHPs since they supposedly contain files themselves
Star Crusader - GLs, DATs, and it's single sounds.pak which apparently contains wav files of strange structure
and Xanth (and it's relatives) - MUS (contains midis as far as I know) PIC (Possibly contains PCXs) and RGN (Maybe conains sounds)

They are old indeed but it would be nice if at least one or two were supported, I can provide some of those files if you want

I really wish someone could make MultiEx support Metal Gear Solid 2 PC.  I really don't have the time, but I really want access to the dialog files, sounds, and music.  I am no scripter/programmer/hacker.  I'm sure even with tutorials on how to do it I am not the right kind of thinker for it.  Plus I don't have the time right now.

But I do want access to the game's .dat files so bad, that I am even willing to pay someone money to do it.  Not much, but if someone doesn't want to do it for free, a bribe is ok with me.

I might be able to find someone at my school who can help me with that, but I am too busy to worry about it right now.  Still, I have been trying to access these files for several months now, with no success.
