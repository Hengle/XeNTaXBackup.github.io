Hi, I have a sound file from F1 2006 on the psp, the format name is .awb but when i try to extrack it with vgmtoolbox using the cri extractor it says it's not a valid awb file. But I can extract it with psound, there's multiple samples inside the file, hope someone could help me figure out what format is this. I've attached the file below.
