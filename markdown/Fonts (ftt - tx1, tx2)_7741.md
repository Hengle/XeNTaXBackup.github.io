- Post Title: Fonts (ftt -> tx1, tx2)

Hi, need help with fonts. Check attached file. There are some files inside.

24_32\Fonts.bmp - it is just BMP header + Fonts.tx2
24_32\Fonts.tx1 - No idea
24_32\Fonts.tx2 - RAW graphics data (seems to be always RGB+A [24B+8B] format)
m1\A.3df - No idea
m1\C.3df - No idea
font.ftt - No idea - maybe some open type font format?

I need help with extracting/replacing characters info to change fonts. Is anybody familiar with this font/graphics type? It is used in many "Nordic Games" indie games.
