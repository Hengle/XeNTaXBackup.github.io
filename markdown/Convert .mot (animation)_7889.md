This is the same as asking for something that can view .mdl files. You are looking at dozens of different actual model formats and virtually no viewer/converter on the planet is going to handle every different .mdl format. .mot, .mtn, .anm, .ani, etc. are the most common extensions used across various games for animation data. Same extension does not mean same format. Most of the time you are looking at a totally different, often proprietary format. You need to at least give specific game names if you want anyone to answer you.

I have a hunch you mean the .mot files from the Crisis Core, 3rd Birthday, and FF Type-0 games, because I keep getting requests for those in particular. If you do, then no, no one has reversed those formats (mostly 1 format, though I bet Crisis Core is a bit different from the latter games) to my knowledge.
