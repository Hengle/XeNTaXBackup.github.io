- Post Title: "...Iru!" SL01 Compression?

Heya! I'm trying to work with the files of "...Iru!" for the PSX, but most seem compressed using a method that heads all the files with "SL01" ("53 4C 30 31" in hex).
According to this thread, this is lzo1x compression, yet the values for SIZE and ZSIZE used by the provided script are far too large to work for decompression (they exceed the length of the compressed area or total file size): [viewtopic.php?f=21&t=15505](https://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=21&t=15505)

Any clue how to decompress these? I apologize if this is a bit of a basic question, I'm still fairly unfamiliar with observing compression methods through hex...

Thanks!~
