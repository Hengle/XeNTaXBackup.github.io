- Post Title: 3 transformation matrices in mesh file

could anyone explain why would a mesh have 3x 4x4 transformation matrices in it?

the .msh file iv tried to research  has 3  4x4  - As far as testing shows
1st 4x is scale
2st 4x is rotation
3st 4x is transform
4st 4x is position
the 1st and 3rd are bogus - i cant seem to determine which one is translation - using noesis it just seems to simply scale with both.

And then 3  of the matrices?

Anyone seen any format that uses 3 matrices before?
