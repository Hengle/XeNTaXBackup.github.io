- Post Title: I encounter an error while trying to extract a psarc file.

This is the beginning of the list psarc.exe compiled. It continues the same for the rest of 30k files that are packed there.

Did someone encounter this? Have you any ideas how to fix this? Btw. it's for sound files from Uncharted: The Lost Legacy, which is kinda similar to Uncharted 4, with the exception that Uncharted 4 extracted just fine. Thank you
