- Post Title: Fallout 76's new encryption. New methods needed.

I've noticed that the encryption for a ba2 file seems to have been upgraded once again! Instead of the previous "BTDX" header, it starts with "->" when opened in a hex editor. I'm guessing more compression rather than file hierarchy. Hopefully we can get the BAE updated for this new compression!

They all still start with the BTDX header for me and BAE can extract all of them fine. I have version 0.9.0.15 of the game which is the latest at the moment.

I think he was talking about the pre-load files. Those were encrypted and got decrypted once the first PC B.E.T.A. launched. Now they are all normal ba2 files that can be manipulated and extracted with any of the FO4 tools, including the official Bethesda Archive2.exe

How does it look with the now retail files?
