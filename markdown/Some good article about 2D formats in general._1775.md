- Post Title: Some good article about 2D formats in general.

There are miriads of articles and tutorials about this subject. And sorry, if I kind of state tje obvious for to more advanced readers of this forum. But for less aware people this is the article about the bitmaps I treasure the most: 

[http://astronomy.swin.edu.au/~pbourke/d ... s/bitmaps/](http://astronomy.swin.edu.au/~pbourke/dataformats/bitmaps/)

It is written by Paul Bourke who is a Centre for Astrophysics and Supercomputing University Scholar and Teacher in Melbourne Australia. There is other super good staff on his site where this article coming from. 
It is well explained in plain English and easy to understand. Recommended most highly.

Looks like a very good article indeed. Should help out users with questions on graphics formats!

PS Speaking of stating the bloody obvious, I guess my post in your LOD thread could fit into that category. Sorry if it was all old news to you...no insult of your intelligence intended.

Of course none taken..... 
To contrary, that LOD subject is quite difficult issue for me and any additional information, or even just participation in the discussion is of great help and equally high appreciation. I have a project on my hands requiring full understanding  how the 3D file is written. But, since it is 3D I'll move it to 3D, just little later.

Wow I feel like I learned more from the article than my random Wiki explorations lol. Definitely written in a concise fashion, assuming little prior knowledge of graphics. All the other properties should make more sense now. 

Now I kind of have some idea how to inspect pixel data.
