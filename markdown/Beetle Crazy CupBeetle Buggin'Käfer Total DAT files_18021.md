- Post Title: Beetle Crazy Cup/Beetle Buggin'/Käfer Total DAT files

Hey.

I've been trying on my own with no avail, this seems to be an easy format to crack, files seem to have their names and data there already, and seems to be somewhat a zip format.

Here are 2 sample files: [https://mega.nz/#!OUgzTRaT!oS2aMPeVBE8o ... 2t_wDk4U1o](https://mega.nz/#!OUgzTRaT!oS2aMPeVBE8oJ0yOFx_1FzdBp46LaB3bl2t_wDk4U1o) (3D and artwork)

I would love a script to unpack and repack them, and, if possible, a way to see its 3D models and export them to 3ds or fbx or another common industry format (the latter isn't necessary, but if possible, why not?)

My goal with that is try to mod the game and remove the car event limitation, and get their 3D models and textures.

If you have Radical Racing, it has the same format and will work the same.

huge bump.
Anyone could look into it? Interested on extracting its DATs to take the 3D models.

Hello. I understand that it's been about 2 years now, but have you found a way to unpack or extract these files?

I found! If you still need it. Unpack dat files with quickBMS.
Script for QuickBMS: [http://aluigi.altervista.org/bms/katgames_xpiral.bms](http://aluigi.altervista.org/bms/katgames_xpiral.bms)
