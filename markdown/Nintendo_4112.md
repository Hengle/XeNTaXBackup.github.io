How can you tell the difference between an official Nintendo Gamecube controller, and a third party brand? I have noticed that official Nintendo Gamecube controllers have the words "Nintendo Gamecube" written above the start button in gray writing. Is this method of comparison certain to work, or are there exceptions?
