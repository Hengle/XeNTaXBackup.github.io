What i know about this game is the next.

-Compression=> zlib, the unpacked blocks are 230kb's each
-Graphics=>DDS using a different Header 
-Audio=>FSB, now using FSB4 (crypted?) who knows..

Any unpacker for this?

for the fsb file try my fsbext and if the file is really encrypted don't worry because fmod uses 2 weak type of encryptions so you can see the key or parts of the key in plain-text (the tool will show you these parts):

I have a request related to this game, here 

the .000 files for Tomb Raider Underworld -- is there a program that could extract the files and allow me to reimport them after making any modifications back into the .000 file? The extractor that's been floating around the Tomb Raider Forums can extract files but the names are strange and I fear they might've been changed so reimporting them would be... hard.

Pointless since nobody can repack the DRM files.

I've been wanting to mod Tomb Raider Underworld for some time now. It seems nobody is interested but:

There are already tools which allow you to inject files into the Bigfile.000
There is a tool to decompress DRM files but there isn't one to decompress DRM files
There is also no way of editing DRM files for Tomb Raider ;/

Looks like we're stuck again.

i just played through this again on PS3 and i had no idea how useless the controls are!
i guess the first time, i just thought i was bad at the game, but 2500 hours into skyrim
i'm pretty sure i know how to jump from one ledge to another without leaping to my death. 
the drm issue shouldn't matter if i just need the assets to port the game to another engine.

will this
Gibbed.TombRaider.Unpack
Download and Compile this.
[http://svn.gib.me/public/deusex3/trunk/](http://svn.gib.me/public/deusex3/trunk/)

successfully get the character/static/environment meshes and textures?
the game mechanics will all have to be re-written in the new engine.

also, will i have to buy TRU for PC to have access to the game assets,
or is it possible to extract them from the PS3 game disc?

[also, every post on this website is knee-deep in jargon, is there a faq or jumpstart thread?]

this looked really promising until i clicked all the crucial hyperlinks
only to find out they have probably all been dead for years...

[http://archive.tombraiderhub.com/tr8/mo ... x.html#top](http://archive.tombraiderhub.com/tr8/modding/xna/index.html#top)

does this mean there might be a 7-zip kicking around
with all the files and textures listed in the xna build?
