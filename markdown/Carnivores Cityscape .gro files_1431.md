Could you please add support for *.gro files from Carnivores Cityscape? You may not have to do much, I believe that they are a standard archive format. Too large to upload, so I'll attach snippets here for you...

EDIT: Hold on, I've got to crunch the file smaller... and clear out my upload thingie.

EDIT2: Damn, I can't get either file small enough, even with the smallest setting... I'll email them to you.

Not to be rude, but I figured I'd bump this... Perhaps I should forward the email to Watto...?

Hi mate,

You can send them to me if you want - it doesn't worry me to much. I should be able to look at them in about a days time. I am busy though just like Mr Mouse so I can't make any guarentees anywhere

Okay, I'll forward it to you both... I've still got the original message in my 'Send'  box. 

EDIT: Hmm... it would seem that I forgot to strip the header stuff when I forwarded it... My bad...

OK well one of the files was just a zip (I think it was the sounds one) so just rename it to *.zip and open it in Winzip. The other one I was unsure about - it didn't really look like an archive so I couldn't do anything with it. Sorry mate.

Hmm... in the virus-scan I ran on them, it was scanning files within both of them... I was using AVG, just so you know...

What was the name of the one that seems to be just a zip file?

The one called sounds.gro is definately a zip file - the 2 pieces of the file that you sent (the head and the tail) both confirmed that it is a zip file. (ie the head file had the archive PK tags, and the tail file had the zip directory)

Okay. Scanning it with TrID, then opening it in XVI32, I've come to the conclusion as well that the other file is not an archive. However, TrID said something about it being a Computer Graphics Metafile...
