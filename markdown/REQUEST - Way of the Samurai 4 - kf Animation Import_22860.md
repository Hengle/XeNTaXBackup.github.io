- Post Title: REQUEST - Way of the Samurai 4 - kf Animation Import

Hello,

I am just trying to figure out how to import those .kf files to Blender, but it seems that no program or script is able to import or convert one of those animations. We can open and export the models with the complete skeleton via Noesis, but the related .kf files not, as it seems. Gamebryo File Format, Version 30.1.0.3 from the game Way of the Samurai 4. I can export those .kf files to .fbx via Noesis, but the problem is that the animations are not working in Blender then.

Here is a link for some samples, in case someone would be so kind and take a look at those files. The .nif files are no problem, but the .kf files are. Maybe someone know how to export them properly to .fbx, in a way that those animations are working in Blender, or maybe even someone would like to write a updated .kf Import script if i am allowed to dream a bit
