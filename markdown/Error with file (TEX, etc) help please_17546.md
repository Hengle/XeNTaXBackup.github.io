- Post Title: Error with file (TEX, etc) help please

I want to extract the content of "Red Dead Revolver" for a long time. I recently discovered that with the "iRipper" program I can see the game files on PS2 and Xbox. The problem is that when I strike any file I get an error. Then the program continues. I can even extract the files. These files have X megas but nevertheless, when I open them with the HxD program they are empty. I know that the program was made for other games but nevertheless, you see the content that the files have. If someone has the solution, .. Thanks

EDIT:
, I can not have discovered something. With version 1.8b I can preview the files. In ps2 they look pixelated and when they download it they remain the same. In xbox I can see the files but when I extract it, I can not open the XTEX files. I have attached files because I would also like to know what is the file for 3d models and how I can open them.
