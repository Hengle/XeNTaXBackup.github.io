- Post Title: Target (1998) texture formats

The game uses a custom engine called RPL. I have managed to figure out the archive format of this game, and then tried to look at the sprites/textures in the game. Due to how the archives work, the files have no extension. I didn't get very far as I have no idea about image formats, but I managed to rip some menu backgrounds/HUD elements as I could import them using raw data in GIMP

I uploaded unpacked archives which I assume have the images for the game [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1NUM9_LitsdGlzWTGeQ7hDTxa9zcfR90_?usp=share_link) because they were too large to attach on the forum
