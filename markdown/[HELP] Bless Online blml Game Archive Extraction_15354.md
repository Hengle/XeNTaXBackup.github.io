- Post Title: [HELP] Bless Online blml Game Archive Extraction

I will tell the story shortly, Bless Online is a new upcoming MMORPG game which released in Korea and to be released on RU later this month.
I have Translated the whole game from KR->EN for free for the Bless-Source community.
I didn't translate the skills because they are protected by encryption in different file.
the file extension is .blml which I think stands for "Bless Media Library".
Inside that blml file the skills text are.
Someone did extract that file from there and was able to pack it back but he never released the software he made because... well he is a dick.
Anyways I'm totally bad in Reverse engineering but i'll upload the file and the game .exe so maybe you will able to extract the key from there to unpack the file or you will need to download the full game ? I have no idea.
the .exe is 64bit because my OS is 64bit.

Hope there's someone smart enough among you guys because I really wanna come ready to the release of the RU version of the game later this month
and translate the whole game including the Skills which locked inside this file O_O
Thank you in advance,
