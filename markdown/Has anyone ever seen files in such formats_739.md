- Post Title: Has anyone ever seen files in such formats?

I think these are some MIDI/note music files, but if they are, I have no idea what could read/convert them... One is from "Realms of the Haunting", another from "Alone in the Dark IV", and I'd love to identify this format and be able to read it..

The files without extension (just like those in the midi and levels folders) of the "Alone in the Dark New Nigthmare" game are simply compressed with zlib, so is very easy to extract them.
