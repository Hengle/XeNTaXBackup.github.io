- Post Title: [pc] Tantra Online - TMB mesh & anim

Hi everyone , im wondering if someone can help me with this file, for the game Tantra online 
I already have an unpacker for .hpk files , wich contains all the .dds files for textures, now im looking for a program to pack/unpack the meshes and animation

i uploaded a rar as example , containing 
tmb = mesh
tab = anim
dds = texture (already unpacked by me)

[http://www.darkinc.net/tantra.rar](http://www.darkinc.net/tantra.rar)

i hope someone can do it , since im not good at this

ps : since im new here , i want to ask before do it, if its allowed to post to hire someone to make a paid work for me ?

thanks!

you should search the form first I posted this a while ago.
[viewtopic.php?f=16&t=3299](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=3299)
also this would go in the 3d model section as the archives are already extracted.
