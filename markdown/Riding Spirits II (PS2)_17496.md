- Post Title: Riding Spirits II (PS2)

I would like to have some help with this game, it's a motorbike racing game by Capcom, after extracting the iso, I got 2 files with .vol format (I guess that the models are there), I tried with some hope exporting the files with Gran Turismo tools  but ofc it didn't work.
Tried ninjaripper too, but the mesh gets reaaaaally deformed.
