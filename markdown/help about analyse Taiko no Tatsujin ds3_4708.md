We want to translate Taiko no Tatsujin ds3(Taiko no Tatsujin Dororon Yookai Daikessen), it's interesting because it add RPG mode. Now we have a problem about extract the RPG mode text.

We suspect the file rpgmsg.pb contains the RPG mode text, but seems it is encrypted. And we found that NO$GBA debug version can't run this ROM, so can anyone help encrypt the file or make NO$GBA debug version can run this rom.

I found that NO$Zoomer can run the rom, so I replace the BIOS in NO$GBA debug version and start with BIOS mode, but it still crash.
We have extraced the pictrue and the text of letters and even the font library, the remaining problem is we can't find the RPG mode text.

Thank u very much.
