- Post Title: How can I rip models from Train Sim 2020 or Train Sim World?

Either [this game](https://store.steampowered.com/app/530070/Train_Sim_World_2020/) or [this one](https://store.steampowered.com/app/24010/Train_Simulator_2020/)! TSW uses Unreal, if that's any help - though I'd prefer to get advice from someone who's successfully extracted a train from either...!

I've tried using 3D Ripper DX with Train Simulator, but I'm having trouble getting it to recognise the capture button... =/

Any ideas, folks? I intend building my own trains in 3D, but I figured I'd get these games as research for my own project - thought it'd be fairly easy to extract the models and, ha ha ha, not so, it seems.

Any help appreciated - thanks in advance!

Hey @qs12! I appreciate the advice, but as you can see, [Umodel seems to be having trouble with TSW](https://www.gildor.org/smf/index.php/topic,7148.new.html#new).

I'm fast coming to the conclusion that I'll have to make do with 2D captures... or 'screenshots'...! =D

What engine does Train Sim 2020 use? Maybe I can help you out further
