- Post Title: Prototype 1, prototype 2

Hello everyone, everything good?
hope so!
Good, I'm from Brazil.
I need File Extractors for Prototype 1 and 2
I know it's an old game from 2009 to 2012.
more your files in:
Texture
Environment
Animation
3D Cities
are perfect for me to do programming on Unity and U.D.K, 3D MAX and Cinema 4d.
Could you help me find the Extractors for Prtotype 1 and 2?
