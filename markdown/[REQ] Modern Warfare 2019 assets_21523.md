- Post Title: [REQ] Modern Warfare 2019 assets

Its been roughly 2 months since Modern Warfare launched and there's been hardly any assets from the game made publicly available. The only one that are available are the awful garry's mod ports and some questionable quality p3dm rips of the operators and lethal equipment.

I think it should be fairly obvious, but I don't own Modern Warfare. I also have no idea of how I'm supposed to use the Greyhound tool so using a pirated copy isn't an option for me, either. I'm only looking for the model and textures of the games' HK 433 assault rifle (named in game 'Kilo 141').

It legitimately baffles me that i've seen more people claiming to have modern warfare's assets ripped than i've seen actual public releases of said assets, and everyone who's claimed to have ripped the assets from the game aren't willing to share them.
