- Post Title: Valkyrie Anatomia APK - decryption request?

I need a helping hand with decrypting this particular file that contains assets and images/graphics. A reason I need them is because I'm doing the reddit user flairs for Valkyrie Anatomia Reddit [https://www.reddit.com/r/valkyrieanatomia/](https://www.reddit.com/r/valkyrieanatomia/). My skills in particular programming are below average to create a script and my strength focuses on CSS/HTML. Any extracted files, even small ones are greatly appreciated.

Here, a file a reddit user already uploaded is at a particular link - please contact me for files. That file contains extracted Valkyrie Anatomia apk. If anyone who is a fan of Valkyrie Profile with some extra time on their hands to try this obfuscated files, it would be awesome.

Valkyrie Anatomia is new mobile game released from Square Enix and prequel to Valkyrie Profile series. It is also up on Google Play and App Store in Japan.
