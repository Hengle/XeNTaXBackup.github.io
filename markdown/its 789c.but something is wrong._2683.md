It's packed with zlib, unpacked with zlibc it's 34.816bytes and unpacked with precomp it's 51.720 bytes

Anyway, the file contains 3 files, one looks pre-compressed too
Any light?

It's 3 files inside! I use offzip and get 3 files as well! 2 images(modified DDS?) and 1 3D model?

What game is it from? It might help to figure out the format!
