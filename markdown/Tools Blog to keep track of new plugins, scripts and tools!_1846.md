- Post Title: Tools Blog to keep track of new plugins, scripts and tools!

We have set up a Tools Blog to keep track of new MexCom plugins, scripts and tools and such. 

[http://www.xentax.com/tblog/index.php](http://www.xentax.com/tblog/index.php)

Hope you will find it useful in the future! 

Any new stuff adding on to MultiEx Commander will also show up there for permanent download. 

Cheers,

Mr.Mouse

Actually, Captain had a better idea still. To use the blog as the new homepage. So that is what I will do.

Hmm... more work-intensive, but potentially a better system. Can't wait to see what you make of it!  

P.S. Better get a replacement index.php page up soon...

Which index.php do you refer to? The homepage? Or the blog?

The blog is actually not that work intensive, I won't probably make it all that fancy, as I don't have the time, but the adding of new items is way easier than the homepage as it is now, that's updating html when ever there's something new to report. And a drag.

I was referring to the homepage... Sorry, I should have been more specific.

What are you talking about? There's nothing more enjoyable than working with raw HTML! *skips off to the dentist whistling a happy tune*
