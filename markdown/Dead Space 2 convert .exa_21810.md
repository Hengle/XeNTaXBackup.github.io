- Post Title: Dead Space 2 convert .exa

Hi, I'm using ealayer3 to convert the game's .exa files to mp3. 
It's worked for every other file except this one, I'm unable to attach it, so I uploaded it to mediafire. 
[http://www.mediafire.com/file/3fz5gkpdl ... 8.exa/file](http://www.mediafire.com/file/3fz5gkpdljw45er/seekerrifle_08.exa/file)
When using verbose logging, it puts this out: 

```
>L: header B loader incorrect because of block type
>L: headerless loader incorrect because of flags
>The input is not in a readable file format.'

```


I'd appreciate it if I could get any help on how I might be able to convert it, thanks.
