- Post Title: Little Big Planet Karting (PS3) - desc/bin

Hi there!

I'm currently at a loss trying to parse the main archive from Little Big Planet Karting for PS3. The TOC is saved inside the INSTALLFILE.DESC, the data inside the BIGINSTALL.BIN, which seems to be compressed:

The Installfile.DESC starts with the file names and some unknown data in between:

@ offset 0x08046c:

@ offset 0x0873fc:



Does anyone have an idea? I can provide samples!
Thanks and regards, Timo

Sorry to bump...
I've attached something to look at.
