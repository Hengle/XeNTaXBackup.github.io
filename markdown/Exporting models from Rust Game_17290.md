- Post Title: Exporting models from Rust Game

Hey guys,

I've been recently trying to export some of the playermodels from the game 'Rust'. I've attempted multiple programs with no luck of getting anything, I've tried the following: Ninja ripper, Intel GPA (Some person on Facepunch said it worked for them but I can't get it to work at all), Unity Studio (Unless I did it wrong, not sure)

I'm not sure what to try to export the models out, my main goto is Ninjaripper but I can't find much on the internet on what program to use to export from Rust, please let me know if you know anything,

Thank you!
