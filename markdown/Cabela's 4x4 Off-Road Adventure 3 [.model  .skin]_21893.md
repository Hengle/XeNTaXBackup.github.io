I was wondering if anyone has figured this one out yet, I've got a zip for 'Car1' which was extracted from the games ARC file. Linked below is the zip file, I was wondering if anyone smarter than me would be able to make a MaxScript or something similar to import the model. The textures are just TGA files, and freely visible in the zip as well.

Writing scripts is a time consuming task - I prefer showing how to get the first submesh (using hex2obj, view link in my sig):
