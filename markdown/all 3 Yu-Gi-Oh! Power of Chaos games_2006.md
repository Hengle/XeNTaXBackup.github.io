- Post Title: all 3 Yu-Gi-Oh! Power of Chaos games

Hello,

The 3 games I'm talking about all have a 'data.dat' file, in which all their decks are saved. I like to be able to see and modify things in the data.dat file, like the decks.

A while ago, there was 1 program that did this work. However, the site is down, the program is gone and the guy who made the program cannot be contacted anymore. That's why I'm requesting it now, because I deleted it some months ago, because I didn't play it anymore (but now I do again, and like to extract the decks).

The decks are saved uncompressed and are in .ydc format (in case you need this information). Everything else isn't important so hopefully you can cut time with this information.

Unfortunately, Filecutter doesn't work on the files. I get 2 blank notifications and nothing is saved. Maybe the problem is the files are 200MB each (alot being information I don't need to extract).

In case you need, these are the names of the 3 games

Yugi the Destiny
Kaiba the Revenge
Joey the Passion

Thanks
