- Post Title: Paraworld (Parawelt) Custom Server Scripts

Hi everyone! =)

I like very much rts games, especially Starcraft and Paraworld. And I do some modding with paraworld too (making new units, upgrades, etc...). The game's scripting is very good, so i can do very cool things. The scripts, which define the special abilities and the functions of units and structures are server scripts. They could be edited just as easy as the others, but the problems is, they are also precompiled and embedded in the games exe file, and the game uses these. This was done to guarantee  untampered game servers for multiplayer leagues. Sadly, this is all history now; the developers went on bankrupt and no one pay attention to the game, only a small team of modders (i'm part of that team   ). So even if i delete the server scripts from the installation directory, the game still works. One of the original developers said there is a config option, to enable custom server scripts, but he couldn't tell us exactly how to set this.
And i ask for your help to find out, what could be this settings, or to find another way to get the game to use custom scripts (e.g. hacking the exe files or even modify them if its possible). If anyone is interested, and feel like to make attempts to find a solution, please tell me =) and i can tell further details or informations and provide files

Thank you in advance
