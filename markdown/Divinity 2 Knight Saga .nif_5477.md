- Post Title: Divinity 2 Knight Saga .nif

Hi !
I've got a problem with GameBryo .nif and .kf file format. I was trying to open models and animation form Divinity II: Dragon Knight Saga.
When I try to open any Skeleton.nif file, it works as it should. The pain begins when I want to open other .nif or .kf... I have tried NifSkope, even the checkout from repository, but still nothing. Can somebody look at this files ? It would help me =)

Thanks in advance =)
