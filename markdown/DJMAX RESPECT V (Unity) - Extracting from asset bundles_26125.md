- Post Title: DJMAX RESPECT V (Unity) - Extracting from asset bundles

This game on Steam has been making me interested recently, was wondering how i could extract what seems to be asset bundles. Some seem to be fine to extract, but it seems it has some sort of encryption for a handful of files, one being mainly 12 gb in size. I want to break it if possible because there are some things i want to get extracted. I can post samples if any of you are up for it.
