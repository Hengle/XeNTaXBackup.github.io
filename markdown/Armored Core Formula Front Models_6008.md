- Post Title: Armored Core Formula Front Models?

I'd like to request a way to extract the models from Armored Core Formula Front for the PSP.

I have used Noesis so far and that has worked great! It opened the .bnd container in the iso but when it finished extracting I got many files that weren't what I expected. I don't know which ones are the models. There were so many different types of files that got extracted, but I tested a few of each. Seems I got openable .gim files which I could rip with gitMO and some other .bnd files (compressed compressed files?) which Noesis tried to export into .gim (they turned out to be flat texture images). Everything else is of an unknown format. Still no models though.


I uploaded a few of the files extracted in a .rar. As I don't know which contains the models (or what can open them) I have to upload a bit. If this is in the wrong section sorry about my noviceness, I assumed it was related to models, because the archive is already extractable.
x1 TXT - (Game data references?) 
x1 DEF - (Has some text data on game interface)
x3 TEMs - (Has descriptions for things in the game, I think)
x3 PRDs - (Might be some form of nulls but with ddd)
x2 PPMs - (Alphabet tables maybe?)
x3 MSBs - (?)
x3 MRBs - (A named header means something I hope)
x2 KFMs - (Camera data maybe?)
x2 FFPs - (?)
x4 DATs - (Could have models...)
x3 CM2s - (Small camera data?)
x7 BNDs - (These are larger than most other files so they seem most likely to contain models, also they're names too, however whenever I extract them I get .gim and .ani data, I haven't tried all of them, but I intend too.)
x4 BINs - (Seem to have they're own varieties of containers, but I don't really understand them)
x2 ANIs - (I tried to open a few in Jasc Ani' shop but they freeze it)

Some people might prefer Mediafire more.

I saw that two other members have worked on extracting these files too ([here](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=4495&start=0&hilit=armored+core)), but I have no idea how to get the models from the extracted files. I figured it would be sorted and a little straight-forward.
