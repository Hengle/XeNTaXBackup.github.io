This fsb4 archive uses mpeg layer 1.

[http://www.hcs64.com/files/fsbii06.zip](http://www.hcs64.com/files/fsbii06.zip)

To seperate the fsb streams into individual containers

[http://www.hcs64.com/files/fsb_mpeg09.zip](http://www.hcs64.com/files/fsb_mpeg09.zip)

this decodes the mpeg fsb's to wave file, it has a -p padding swtich which you can set the number based off of the padding, in this case it uses 4, so put -p 4.

thanks to hcs for these tools.

NOTE; if encounter an mpeg layer 3 mutlichannel file fsb_mpeg is your best bet..

fyi, you don't need to use fsbii, newer versions of fsb_mpeg will pull out the subfiles by itself.
