> In order to get the rival music in the normal stages I simply renamed the files - so for example if you wanted Ken's music on the USA stage (the drive-in stage) you would simply make a copy of the file BGM_KEN.csb and rename it to BGM_USA.csb, then overwrite the original BGM_USA.csb with the new one.

This is when the faster (more dramatic) bit of music would normally start playing to indicate the fight was close to finishing, however in the rival fights this doesn't actually happen (the same piece of music continues playing from the start of the fight to the end). It seems as though the game still wants to start playing this faster piece of music towards the end of the fights but perhaps the rival *.csb files don't contain it, so instead you don't hear anything.

Also I couldn't find Bison's rival music anywhere, despite hearing it when you play Bison at the rival stage of the arcade mode (it's like a remix of Bison's SF2 music), but that isn't important right now.

 Well, as you can see, Change the BGM names doesn't work 100%  because the music turns off when we do some special move, or something like that. 
How this can be fixed??

Thanx!

Well, this is an out-of-place type of request, because you're asking us to help mod the game directly. 
Second, we don't have this game, so we will need files to work with. It is a very specific request.
