Here's an old DOS game. Company has already disappeared, so copyright issues probably aren't an issue.

Anyways I've unpacked the archives and am looking at (presumably) an image file since it's from an archive called "BACKGRND"

A different set of saf files.
Similar format, but may contain more information since it's different types of images.

Looking a little further, it's possible that an animation sequence is stored in a single saf file. So for example, I unpacked an archive called "fight" which probably contains battle animations for all of the sprites, so each saf file may contain a bunch of images making up the animation sequence.

I would then think that those shorts in the header are image numbers, and the longs are offsets.
