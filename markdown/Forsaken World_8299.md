Some things

1: all (or at least, 99%) of the  filenames are in chinese (gb2132). Don't know if it will be a problem for some people. 

2: some of the referenced textures do not even exist. Some models refer to psd files, which I guess these are just test models that they didn't remove. I dealt with this by simply creating dummy NoeTexture objects so at least the indices are correct, so you might see "texture data is not a bytearray!" in the debug log.

3: there are two types of models: skinned and unskinned. They use separate mesh counts to indicate this, and so I just generated my own flags for that.

These formats I had already written in my Sanae3D tool so it was easy to convert to noesis.

I think perfect world uses the same format.
