- Post Title: [GTA V] Snapmatic Studio

Snapmatic uploading isn't working for me so I decided to investigate the format used to save these pictures. FYI they're located in \Documents\Rockstar Games\GTA V\Profiles\<your profile>\GTA5##########

One thing led to another and I ended up making a viewer with lots of features. Enjoy!
