- Post Title: Extracing Déraciné .sxd2 audio

To preface Deracine was a PSVR game made by Fromsoft on unreal engine.
If it helps the engine version is 4.18. 
Going by what a few acquaintances have said, the sxd2 file may contain multiple at9 files similar to how fsb files stored at9s with Bloodborne (either that or its at9 data with an sxd2 header) but it doesn’t contain the information to tell where the tracks start and stop. 
I’m not sure if that information is stored anywhere in the uexp or uasset file provided, but it’s the only other two files that correspond with the sxd2. 
Help with extracting the audio would be appreciated
