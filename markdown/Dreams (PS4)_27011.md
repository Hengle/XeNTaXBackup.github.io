- Post Title: Dreams (PS4)

Hello

With Media Molecule closing the Dreams servers this September - does anyone know if there is anyone working on reversing the model data? I've never played the game but it seems a crime that the content there cannot be exported to other engines.

I'd be interested in working on reversing their online connections - or if there is anyone doing the same thing - please let me know (maybe a discord or another forum I'm missing)

Thanks
