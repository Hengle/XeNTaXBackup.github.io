- Post Title: Crusty Demons - ARCHIVE.IMP

I've came across a beta CD-R of Crusty Demons and was looking at the files on the disk when I came across ARCHIVE.IMP and ARCHIVE.XML. A quick check of the retail DVD version shows the same files, with differing file sizes and contents. ARCHIVE.XML seems to contain a filelist of files contained within ARCHIVE.IMP.

Has anybody came across these files before, or have any idea as to how to begin extracting them? I've had a look in ps2dis and I can see a reference to archive.xml so the executables do seem to be using it.
