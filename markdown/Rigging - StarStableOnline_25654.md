- Post Title: Rigging - StarStableOnline

Hi ! 
For a long time we have been looking for ways to access the 3D models and textures of the game StarStableOnline ( [viewtopic.php?f=21&t=21036](https://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=21&t=21036) ). We succeeded but I would like to give my own poses to the characters and horses in Blender... When I open the 3D models with Blender, there is no rigging. Do you know how to access it? Do I have to create my own?
