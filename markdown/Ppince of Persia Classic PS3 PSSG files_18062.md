- Post Title: Ppince of Persia Classic PS3 PSSG files

Hello!
I'm trying to extract 3D models from Prince of Persia Classic (PS3). I know that the most models are identical to PoP: Sands of Time, but some (like Princess Farah) is different. I found that 3D models are in .pssg format, but all that I could extract is textures (with Ego PSSG Editor) 'cause 3DSimED3 program can't recognize 3D models  If anybody could help, please help me!
Files are here: [http://www.mediafire.com/file/tmm7x9375 ... C_PSSG.rar](http://www.mediafire.com/file/tmm7x93757oceaf/PoPC_PSSG.rar)

(hex2obj doesn't support DWord tri strips so far, so I had to convert them to Words before handling them.)
Nevertheless they don't seem to work, I remember having had a similar problem but dunno, which format it was.

Well, because this is a mouse  Any tools to convert 3D into obj, fbx or to other formats?
