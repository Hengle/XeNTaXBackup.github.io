- Post Title: Elder Scrolls Online .gr2

Hi all, I was curious as to whether someone might be willing to take a look at the models from Elder Scrolls Online. Given their extension, I thought at first that they might be in the same format as those in The Old Republic or other games using this engine, but looking into it further I realized that the gr2 format can vary greatly between games. The granny2 plugin for Noesis can't read ESO's models. To any interested, I've posted a couple of samples. Thanks for looking!

Hi! How did you get the models? I am really curious. The only process I know is to use the dx ripper but it seems you got them through other means.

Edit: OMG! I successfully exported a model to blender. I dunno if my gr2 files were well exported (since I can't find mannimarco model anywhere lol) so I dunno if I should make a tutorial. If someone could help me making a tutorial I would appreciate it. I think others would too.
