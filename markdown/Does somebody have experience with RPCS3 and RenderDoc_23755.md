- Post Title: Does somebody have experience with RPCS3 and RenderDoc?

Greetings,

Im having trouble getting RenderDoc to work with RPCS3. I would like to use Vulkan but whenever i try that i get an error.



I tried it with OpenGL and there it worked until i tried to make the capture.. There it froze and it didn't complete the capture. Any Tips?

OS: Windows 10
GPU: AMD STRIX RX 580 O8G
