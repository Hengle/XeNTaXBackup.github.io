The only working tool for Carbon as far as I know is Labrune --> [https://nfsmods.xyz/mod/1292](https://nfsmods.xyz/mod/1292)

For other games from the series you can check NFS-LangEd --> [https://nfs-tools.blogspot.com/p/downloads.html](https://nfs-tools.blogspot.com/p/downloads.html)

Labrune does not support Cyrillic, but supports NFS Carbon
NFS LANGED does not support carbon, but supports Cyrillic.
How to add support for Cyrillic in Labrune, or how to add support for NFS Carbon in NFS LangEd?

I have no idea, never used these tools ;p

Maybe try to contact creators and ask them for Cyrillic support
or try do some tricks with editing game font to replace non-used characters.

Alternative and stable way to edit languages.bin is by using Binary: [https://nfsmods.xyz/mod/1638](https://nfsmods.xyz/mod/1638)
