I recently got Wrestle Kingomd 2 for my PS2 and I was wondering if anyone could tell me how to extract the wrestlers textures from it. I got all of the files onto my PC, so could anyone tell me which folder the textures would be in and how I extract them please? Thanks.

I took a pic of the files here:

My guess would be the data.dip file.

Upload the file and post the link here. There is a file splitter if you don't want to upload the whole thing.

I was actually trying to get help for this same excat thing. Im uploading the data.dip file to file front as we speak but its big so itll be a while lol. Ill edit this post with the link when it becomes available. Also on a side note has anyone extracted textures from smackdown vs raw, svr 06 or svr07? And if so where could I find them. Im a member of a site called the no mercy zone and we mod wwf no mercy for the nintendo 64 by making our own moves and texturing the in game graphics, so these textures would be of great use to now just me but the whole community Im involved in. Any help from any member here would be greatly appreciated and you will be credited for the files you help us obtain. Thanks in advance.


edit im having trouble uploading the dip file mainly because of its size. Does anyone know a good file host?

I'll try using the file splitter and then upload it that way. Or I'll try using File Front to upload the full thing while I'm not on the PC later.

whoa, just a clip should have been good. That's a lot of trouble you went to. I looked at the file and I can see the graphics but I can't export to a useable format. They appear to be some kind of indexed or palletted graphic. The file identifier is RTX3 if that helps anyone

damn I hate being such a noob at this thanks for your time maybe someone else can help though.


EDIT: I was looking through the forum and it seems that the Rumble Roses game used rtx3 textures as well and someone named jasmine was able to extract files from it. Maybe thats some help to someone whos more experienced at file extraction.


EDIT: I Pm'd jasmine in regards to rtx3 files setting and this was the response i recieved.


That program was written a good while ago and I have forgotten most of the specs. I did get this from my notes about the rtx3 header format. These data types were written for VB6. Long should be 4 bytes and an integer should be 2 bytes. This should at least give you the pertinent information that you need to reconstruct a suitable header. I used a bmp header to display the file. Let me know if it helps. 

FileID As Long 
TotalSize As Long 
Long1 As Long 
Long2 As Long 
Long3 As Long 
Short1 As Integer 
Short2 As Integer 
Long4 As Long 
Long5 As Long 
ImageWidth As Integer 
ImageHeight As Integer 
ImageSize As Long 
Short3 As Integer 
Null1 As Integer 
Null2 As Integer 
Null3 As Integer 
Null4 As Integer 
Null5 As Integer 
Null6 As Integer 
Null7 As Integer 
Null8 As Integer 
NumberOfColors As Integer 
OffsetToClut As Long 

laters, 
jasmine 


Its all greek to me but Im sure one of you more senior members can use this information and ehelp me extract these textures. I tried to open the data.dip file in multiex commander but it was all for not.

Cool, thanks for the help. I tried uploading the file 3 times and each time Firefox just got bored and didn't finish it.

Here is a rough viewer and exporter for the RTX format.  No import yet.  It converts the RTX graphics into BMP.  Just double-click on a list item and the graphic will be displayed.  Some of the pix may look odd.  That's because they are 32-bit files.  I have not found an appropriate editor for 32-bit BMP files.  If you know of one, let me know.

This was written in C# so you also need the .NET Framework 1.1 installed on your computer if it isn't already.  Have fun and let me know of any bugs that you find.
