You can find them with a rooted android.

You have to get a file explorer android app that has access to the root folder and then you have to go to data/data/com.square_enix.android_googleplay.index_if/files/data .

Several files have the text "UnityFS" in it and with hex editing, it can be opened with AssetStudio.

No, I don't make any decryptors. The only emulator that I know it works with this game is Bluestacks but you can give Bluestacks root access with BlueStacks Tweaker.

I find out that several of the files from the game are not encrypted or encrypted with a 1-byte xor key but the rest are in an unknown format.

Anyone got a script to decrypt this files
I don't get it about xor key
based my opinion the point is the files must decrypt first with script right
After that it can be opened with Asset Studio 
Is that true
By the way i can't find a good script to decrypt this game files

Now we have a quickbms script that decrypt and somewhat detect the unityFS files in a folder (assumes that it's always a 1 byte xor key so might miss some) from A Certain Magical Index: Imaginary Fest. Give thanks to Joschka/Dimy for creating this.

```
quickbms.exe -F "" magicalIndex.bms inputFolder outputFolder
```

Actually it is in root files 
The path is 
/data/data/com.square_enix.android_googleplay.index_if/
It seems not all data can be decrypt with this script
I already test that
But still we have to thanks to them who tried creating script for us
Then i just have to figure it out to creating another script or edit those script
Or i just have to wait the other to makes a script for us all
My mind is blowing to think about it
Because I just an amateur

Just used it and realized that it does not extract the Audio files of the game for some reason or am I missing something here?
