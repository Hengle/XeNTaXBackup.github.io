- Post Title: IMA ADPCM (The Sims Bustin' Out)

I've poked around a bit and it seems that the music from this game is some kind of headerless IMA ADPCM. Converting with sox results in a distorted/slow mess, and it refuses to output anything but mono anyway. You can find a sample below.

If you use Interleaved DVI as the codec, stereo, sample rate 44100 and the interleave is 0x80, then it will play

Thank you so much (again)!
