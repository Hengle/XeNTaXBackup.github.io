Use a QuickBMS script for this game(.arc)... You can find this script in this forum
And use swforce script for .stringlookup files, and sounds are FSB and you can change it with some tools in Nexus forum, and go to zenhax and you can find a way to edit font, i dont have time to set all link for you, sorry about that
