- Post Title: Report Bandwidth stealing sites here.

This thread has been started for anyone that has been tricked into downloading a bogus XeNTaX product. 

It is simple. When sites other than XeNTaX link directly to a file that we at XeNTaX host, they will eventually offer a bogus file to their visitors. 
Why? Because we do not allow other sites to "offer" this product as one of their own downloads, but in reality link to our site and not theirs to start the download from. 

If they would offer the download from their own site there's no problem. If they simply refer to our site as a download option there's no problem. 

So, please report the site here that offered you this bogus file. 
It will only take a minute of your time to register and post. 

Meanwhile, you can download the real file at our site:
[http://www.xentax.com](http://www.xentax.com)

Thanks in advance! 

The XeNTaX Administration

Some sites that serve banner ads and therefore (try) to make money have been linking directly to our files, pretending to host the downloads themselves. This way, they get their ad-revenues, but refuse to pay for serving the downloads. The bill goes to XeNTaX instead. This amounts to stealing in our opinion, and because of this we are taking steps to prevent it. Sorry for the (slight) inconvenience.

Seems in the beginning, right after the countermeasure, it still happened sometimes, and then it quit. This is good.
