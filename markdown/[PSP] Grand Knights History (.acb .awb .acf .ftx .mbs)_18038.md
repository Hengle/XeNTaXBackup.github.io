- Post Title: [PSP] Grand Knights History (*.acb *.awb *.acf *.ftx *.mbs)

The game is entirely 2D. I would like to convert the audio and textures from the game files.
The file structure looks as following:

*.acb - Used for sound effects.
*.awb - Used for music & voice.
*.acf - Sound related. The exact importance is unknown.

*.ftx - Used for textures.
*.mbs - Texture related. Probably stores instructions for texture positions and animations.

[viewtopic.php?f=10&t=7289](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=7289) This old thread had some scripts posted which I couldn't figure out how to make use off. Maybe this is most of the work already done.

The following link contains 6 example files each with one of the file types listed above:

Note: I've tried to use vgmtoolbox which is commonly used to convert .acb / .awb to a usable sound file but it kept giving me an error.

Any advice or help would be very much appreciated.
