- Post Title: Transport Tycoon Deluxe - Created an Adlib music player

Hi all, 

Just wished to share this thing I created as part of another project. May release it as a standalone player. 
I reverse engineered the x86 code for the adlib music player and the music format. Then thought I might as well create a player for Windows.
