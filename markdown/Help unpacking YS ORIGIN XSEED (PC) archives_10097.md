Any info on the compression/encryption used? Any tools to unpack the archive files in the release folder (data.na, data.ni etc.)? 

The data.na file is 1.3gb and houses many RIFF files. Data.ni has a 4 byte header of "NNI " and looks to be encrypted.

Thanks for the link.

After unpacking the YS archives, I was not able to locate all the character DDS textures beyond a handful in the MENU folder. I suspect they are embedded in the animation files.  Within folder ANI, there is both .AIA and .ASO files. Any info on these? The .ASO file has a header beginning with XSR. Hoping someone can point me in the right direction.

Anyone with knowledge of .AIA or .ASO formats?
