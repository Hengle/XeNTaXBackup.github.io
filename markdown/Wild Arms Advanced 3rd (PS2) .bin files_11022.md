To those that are reading this post, greetings.

I was looking for a way to extract the monster models from Wild Arms Advanced 3rd (Wild Arms 3), but as far as I know, models seem to be compressed inside the BTLMON.BIN file. Is there anyone who can help with this matter?

Sample file:

Unfortunately, no. That is a character for Wild Arms 5. Sorry.
