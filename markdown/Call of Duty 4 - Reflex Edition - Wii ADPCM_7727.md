Hi there!

Cany anyone tell me how to play these files: [http://www.gamefront.com/files/21010539 ... i_ADPCM.7z](http://www.gamefront.com/files/21010539/CoD4_Wii_ADPCM.7z)
I know it's normal Wii ADPCM but I'll need a working header for vgmstream to play them. Any help is greatly appreciated! 

Regards, Timo
