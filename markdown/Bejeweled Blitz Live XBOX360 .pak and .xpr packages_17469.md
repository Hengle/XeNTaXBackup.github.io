- Post Title: Bejeweled Blitz Live XBOX360 .pak and .xpr packages

Hello everyone!
I have tried to extract the game files from the XBOX 360 version of "Bejeweled Blitz LIVE".
I have used wxPirs to unpack the files from the archive and then got three .pak files and a .xpr file.
Then I tried to unpack the .pak files as I would open a normal PopCap's .pak file (7x7m, also seen in PvZ, Bejeweled 3 and others) with no success.
So I was wondering if any of you guys could unpack those files [https://drive.google.com/open?id=1IVUT1 ... KxZAY3kCZw](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1IVUT1Lz8_fM5R97_leM-FtKxZAY3kCZw) . I can upload to other sites if you are not familiar with Drive.
Thank you.

Thank you, it worked! I have managed to decompress the packages and see some content, but it still gives me an archive with magic ÀJÀº and, since I am still new to this, I don't know how to unpack. So, could anyone send me a script to unpack this ? Thank you.
edit :; decompressed file at [https://drive.google.com/open?id=1VatuT ... yU1rPKzyO4](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1VatuTBDnK6aX1I7KSB9Xa0yU1rPKzyO4) , they all use same compression.
