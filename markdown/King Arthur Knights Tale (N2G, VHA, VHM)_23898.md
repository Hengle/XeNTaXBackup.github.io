Hi Guys, there is this game in early access, and i love the models, they are with no encryption i think, but i don't recognize the engine (it seems its a proprietary one) does anyone knows how to open this kind of files??
I Attach a non rigged file , as they are too large, but of course i would love to be able to use a rigged file instead, so please if you need it, i can upload one too! 
Thanks!
