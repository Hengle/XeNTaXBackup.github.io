Hello,

do you know about any tool which could manage to translate text in last 2 Harry Potter Games?
Or is there anybody who could try to find text in these games?

(Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 1 and Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2)

All predecessors was translated to my language but not this ones. I want to translate it at least for children


Thank you very much.

I known where the text is, in which files, I am working on figuring out the file format so you can extract it.

Wow, that's great.
Do you have any idea for previous games? (Order the Phoenix and Half-Blood Prince)

Ok, will you still working on that file format?
I took a look at that, but's a very odd format to me.
