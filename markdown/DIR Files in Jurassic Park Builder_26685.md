- Post Title: DIR Files in Jurassic Park: Builder

Hi all. I'm trying to retrieve content from Jurassic Park: Builder by Ludia. I found a file with an extension DIR I don't know. I tried to extract the files from it with QuickBMS and the jurassic_world.bms script, but it doesn't work. Can someone help me?

I am attaching the file for example
