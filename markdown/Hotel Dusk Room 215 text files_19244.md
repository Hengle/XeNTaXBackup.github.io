- Post Title: Hotel Dusk Room 215 text files

Okay, so I extracted text files from Hotel Dusk in order to try and translate this game into my language. Got some raw .txt files for system dialogues like save\load and the in-game text. But the in-game text is archived into .wpf and .tbl files. wpf ones are the archives, and tbl seems to be some kind of lookup table. Unfortunately, my knowledge ended somewhere around there, since the text is somehow compressed; chunks of readable data exist, but are interrupted with garbage. I enclose the files so that maybe someone could look into it.
