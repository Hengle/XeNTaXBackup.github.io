- Post Title: I Am Bread (.assets)

Hello
I tried extract files from .assets files in IAmBread_Data folder using Unity Assets Explorer and DisUnity but both programs seemed to fail. UAE not responding after choosing a file and DisUnity shows an error message:

> [warning] FileCommand: Can't process sharedassets0.assets, caused by info.ata4.u
>
> nity.asset.AssetException: Unknown asset format 14

I also tried Riveal which extracted textures but nothing else. Is there a way to extract audio from this game?

There is probably some change in file structure, because it was made in new Unity 5 engine. So we have to wait until guys update their tools.
