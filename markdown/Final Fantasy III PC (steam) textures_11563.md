Can someone help me to extract textures for battle models from this game?
I've tried tinkle for the nds version, but it seems that this version is slightly altered...

Have you tried using Noesis? The models and textures are likely those from the iPhone version, which is just a port of the PSP version with upscaled textures.

I can extract models and textures from the PSP version and view them in noesis.
But i hoped there was a way to extract them from pc version, and ultimately, edit them back, as it turns out, nothing is upscaled.
PC version uses, as iphone,android and psp one does, 64x64 textures for monsters and 128x128 for players, and that really stands out without any filtering.

I'm a curious noob; forgive me, but where are you seeing a listing for FF III in Noesis?    All I see is imports for FF7 through 13-2, and Type 0. Type 0 was for the PSP; is that the one you're using?
