- Post Title: Battlefield 3 weapons files??[*.soldierweaponbundle]

I have unpack some BF3 Files(X360 version), and got some files with NO EXTENSION in Weapons.toc and Weapons.sb.
They are called, Example:(aek971_soldierweaponbundle),(m40a5_soldierweaponbundle)etc.
So, are these files called "*.soldierweaponbundle" or "xxxxxxxx_soldierweaponbundle"????  
Most of this files are larger than 1MB, so that I think these files are including most of the resource of guns.
could someone make a script to unpack these files????
MANY THANKS!!!!!!!!  
Here are all the "soldierweaponbundle" files I have found(Just 49.06MB, don't worry  ):

I don't think anyone's figured out the subformats of the toc/sb yet. I've just heard from those who've tried that the engine is insanely complex.

insanely complex=encoded up the ass to prevent modders from hacking or god forbid making it less crappy. they already confirmed their own prejudice against modders by threatening to ban people who use that mod that removes their moronic brown/grey filter.
