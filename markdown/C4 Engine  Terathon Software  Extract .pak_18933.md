- Post Title: C4 Engine / Terathon Software / Extract .pak

Hello,
I need your help ! So here I play a game called "Cattle and Crops" and whose graphics engine is C4 Engine developed by Terathon Software and I would like to extract 3d models of this game, they are compressed in a format that is: .pak

Some of their models are exposed on Sketchfab but it is apparently no longer possible to extract them with ninjaripper :/

I hope you can help me!
Have a good day !
Bye
