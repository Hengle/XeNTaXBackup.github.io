- Post Title: Penny Dreadfuls: Sweeney Todd - Archive

I'll appreciate any help or guidance to unpack the "media.pack" archive from "Penny Dreadfuls - Sweeney Todd". 
The head.bin and tail.bin may be downloaded here: [http://motionpress.com/uploads/Penny_Dr ... d_tail.rar](http://motionpress.com/uploads/Penny_Dreadfuls_head_and_tail.rar)
Thanks in advance!
