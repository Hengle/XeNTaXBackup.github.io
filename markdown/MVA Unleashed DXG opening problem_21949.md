- Post Title: MVA Unleashed DXG opening problem

I've red almost all of the posts about DXG files but didn't got an answer to my question, i need to export them into blender or something that exports fbx/obj/dae.. mostly common extensions for 3d models.
So, here's the deal, i tried with noesis but didn't figure out how to use the posted plugin because i'm not into programming and all that stuff, either i tried AMR, i was kind of sure that would have worked but nothing, when i try to open, lets say as example, 125sx_plastics, he tells me "Single source opened" and "Filesize: 0X7E62" then, when i try to see it in ViewScene it's blank and if i try to export it he says "invalid polygon index count".
I would like to open dxg to see how the game reads models and how should i position the model and i'd like to mod my self the game with my bike models.
