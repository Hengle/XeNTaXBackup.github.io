Please could support for Scarface (PC) be added,

bit too big for uploading an example, each data file has
.rcf extension but there > 300Mb
check out attached head/tail from filecutter

googled the header lead me to wiki (no BMS) & then here :p
[http://wiki.xentax.com/index.php/The_In ... ion_(XBox)](http://wiki.xentax.com/index.php/The_Incredible_Hulk_-_Ultimate_Destruction_%28XBox%29)

no demo download, i could split & upload the smallest whole file "movies.rcf" if needed.

Thankyou!!!


Hmm filecutter 256Kb option doesnt work.. ok try here

Okay, well the file contain BIK video files. I'm not too sure about the format though. Could you state exactly how big the original file was? Also, if possible, could you start Hex Workshop and do a search for the ASCII text "BIK" ? And then provide all offsets it finds?

Ive never used a hex editor, sorry if the offset is wrong number
movies.rcf    335,348,468 bytes

these first bik offsets appear to be the file names

2092
2130
2176
2221
2262
2303

these offsets appear to be the file data however theres way more than i expected

4096
1297564
1894186
4214784
4704579
6027615
6157931
+lots more

rest of the rcf's:
cement.rcf 1,587,035,648 bytes
sound1.rcf    486,235,919 bytes
sound2.rcf    498,833,568 bytes

I think it would be easier if you had the whole file since im totally new to this. Uploading now will post back with links.

Thanks!

Yeah game extractor uses The_Incredible_Hulk_-_Ultimate_Destruction_(XBox) profile to extract

ive had (all be it limited) sucess, seams to only extract partially, got 
30,504 .ogg files + 8,335 .png files which ammounts roughly to 900Mb
from cement.rcf (1.5gb total. PC version)

good that game extractor gives a starting block for future work 

Mr.Mouse:
My connex is dynamic ip would explain why universial downloader
is working .. sorry about that.

pyledriver:
EkszBox-ABX cant open the PC version sound1.rcf

woah thankyou!

In cement theres a bunch of .p3d's. RaceDriver 3 used that format and a 3d tool called Zmodeler supported the game, it doesnt have any luck with scarface tho. Thought i'd mention that, might save someone time.

--- edit
google brought this pdf to my attention, maybe theres something there.
Personally, never heard of this format.

Of course, here they are (I'll add them to the wiki or you can do it):

The Rcf header:

```
    dword       unknown
    dword       unknown
    dword       unknown
    dword       nameOfs    start of the filenames
    dword       unknown
    dword       unknown
    dword       fileCount  number of files

```


For each file, starts right after the header:

```
    dword offset
    dword size

```


At nameOfs are the filename records:

```
    dword unknown
    dword unknown
    dword unknown
    dword filenameLength             length of filename string
    char  filename[filenameLength]

```


Two important things to note:
The length of the filename contains the NULL-byte at the end of the string that is not stored, so the actual length is one shorter.
The second thing is that the 1st fileinfo-block (with offset and size) has to be sorted by offset in ascending order first for the filenames to match.
The unknowns are not important for file extraction, probably CRC32 or hash values.

The files themselves are uncompressed.

Spot on!  I was just figuring it out myself, and was staring at the file offsets not matching filenames. Then I was notified of your post and it was a done deal.  I have about the same specs with the unknowns. Files are padded into blocks of 0x800, is what I can add to it. Nice one, Benjamin!

Thanks! 
I can confirm that this tool does work with the XBOX archives. 
Wish i could help more... i'm still a total noob with a hex editor. Does anyone know what these RSD files are? Or how to work with them?

Thanks everyone for the info and help, hopefully soon there will be support for this game in MultiEX Commander!

RSD files are ogg vorbis audio (in PC version) , with "big header" you can recompress if you want, but, take care only minimum at 44.1000Khz, less like 22050Khz  the voices and musics go to fast

> Are these RSD files the actual sound files?
In PC version the RSd are a header with references of the wav of the filename, and after 2048 bytes start the oggvorbis, maybe in Xbox it's the same?

Anyway here it's what i know about the game PC VERSION:

RCF's: packed (not compressed) files, like .big o .tar
RSD's: Audios, in mind: music, voices, effects and ambients All is ogg vorbis
P3D:Are a normal png's very bad compressed heehehh and can be the texts too, the texts it's a small file size (it's in subs folder)
GR2: sure know, granny files, it's animations [http://www.radgametools.com](http://www.radgametools.com)
Bik:Videos, web: the same of above

My apologies in advance...

This question is about the PC version of Scarface. Here goes...

I'm gonna cut straight to the point...
We all know the soundtrack of the Scarface game is awesome. I'm pretty sure I'm halfway to getting the audio files into a workable format, but I'm truly stuck.

At the risk of sounding STUPID, I've run into a problem. As much as I've read all the forums I can find on the topic, I cannot, for the life of me, figure out how to play theses damned RSD files.

I've extracted all the RSD files from sound1.rcf using the "scarexplorer." Now I have an entire directory tree full of these RSD files, but as silly as it sounds, I have NO CLUE what to do with them!!!

Any help would be greatly appreciated!!! And not to sound picky, but some detailed instructions would be nice also!!!! LoL

Has anyone had any luck with the audio files (PC version)?
I've extracted them all (4011) with scarexplorer, but I can't find a utility that can convert them to wav format.
(convert them all, anyway... Only 1500 or so successfully converted)

These gotta be some of the most hilarious sound clips I've heard in a game!
(maybe not as much swearing as Kingpin, but lots -and  a bunch in Spanish!)

OK, just saw the post above... Here's what I've done:
1. Extract ALL 4011 audio files (with scarexplorer)
2. renamed all extensions to .ogg (since that is what they actually are) with [Extension Renamer](http://www.download.com/Extension-Renamer/3000-2248_4-10438760.html?tag=lst-0-6)
(interestingly, WMP11 plays them like this after squawking about the format)
3. convert all to .wav with [Switch Plus](http://www.nch.com.au/switch/plus.html) (-Format: PCM -Attributes: 44.100KHz, 16bit, stereo)
OK, I figured -it finally worked!
Not so fast... I tried to play some and got nothing...
As it turned out, there were thousands of 1KB files that did nothing...
And some that were larger that did nothing. (nothing as in didn't play in Winamp)
Oddly, everything under 86KB didnt work at all.

You don't have to convert all the .rsd files. Game soundtrack consists only of .rsd files that have word "tapeplayer" in their header (116 songs). Take a look [here](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?t=2168) for instruction how to filter them out.

First of all thanks to john_doe for scarexplorer and Nikolai for posting the soundtrack list.

After extracting all the ogg files I noticed that my file count didn't match Nikolai's list, there are 7 extra tunes that apparently do not appear in the game itself, they are definitely not available through Scarface's "tape player". Maybe other people will find even more but here's what I have so far along with the names that scarexplorer extracts them to.

659d0150e1dc57b5.rsd - Dennis Brown - Westbound Train [this is an island radio tune and might actually be heard in-game, I'm not sure]
1617c8e7d6267b50.rsd - Unknown Artist - Unknown Title [sounds like Don Omar and I'm guessing the song name might be called Guerra]
8b2dedc85e34bed4.rsd - Eddy Grant - Electric Avenue
d75362b15b477bda.rsd - Ivy Queen - Dale Volumen
Sam Scarfo - Too Much For T.V. [scarexplorer missed this one, I found it in sound2.rcf at offset 0x15D30000 - 0x160A75CA]
dbd9e9506ba113d7.rsd - The Clash - Police and Thieves [this is not the version featured in the game's music player]
2f837bd813d243b5.rsd - The Minutemen - I Felt Like A Gringo
Enjoy

This time for Scarface, of course.
You can download it from http://gamefileformats.the-underdogs.in ... orer10.zip

I think, that skips some files.  
I extracted all files form sound1.rcf and sound2.rcf with scarexplorer10, used rsd2ogg and i got 96 oggs, (soundtrack has 108 files).  
Then I searched for "tapeplayer" with "Lister"-Total Commander in sound1.rcf and sound2.rcf and i found all missing files, but i dont know how to extract them.  
Still understand?  
Then I searched for "tapeplayer" with "Lister"-Total Commander in all extracted files (by scarexplorer10), but i didnt find any file, that was missing (found in sound1,2.rcf, but not found in extracted files).   
Could someone please help me or recommend me some fully working "ATG CORE CEMENT LIBRARY"(.rcf) extractor?

I found a bug in scarexplorer 1.0!!!  
When you extract only "sound" folder (in "art" folder in sound1.rcf and sound2.rcf), copy it into one folder and run rsd2ogg, it finds only .ogg 89 files.  
When you extract whole "art" folder (from both archives), copy all files from extracted "sound" folder into one folder and run rsd2ogg, it finds all 116 files.  
I tried to find out what is wrong and i found it!!!  
When you extract only sound folder, it doesnt extract "3" and "f" folder in it!!!  
I recommend to extract "art" folder and delete "subtitles" folder in it!
IT PERFECTLY WORKS!!!  
I found 8 files, that arent in tapeplayer in game, but they can be extracted!!!

Some C++ code to rename a single audio file using the path string from the file header. The header is cut off in the new file which makes proper Ogg Vorbis.

```
 Scarface audio extractor (for "Scarface" for PC)

 1. extract "sound1.rfc" and "sound2.rfc" files with "game extractor" (xentax.com) => creates lots of files and dirs in the "extract" dir
 
 2. copy all extracted files into one dir (for better overview only)

 3. move all files with "libVorbis" string inside to a separate dir (1673 files, 932 MB, all audio is Ogg Vorbis in US/PC version)
    => remaining files are all very small -> text files only
    
 4. use the program compiled from this source code on every audio file to remove 2048 byte headers and copy + rename them into a new directory
    -> you may create a batch script from a file list using appropriate tools
    => resulting files are all proper Ogg Vorbis with useful file name
    => "tape tracks" can be identified easier by the new name

Hello guys, great information here, did anyone ever find out how to extract textures off this game? any methods on doing so for this game? For example is it possible to get wall textures from Tony's mansion? where are they located all I see is bunch of .P3D which are probably from Pure 3D, which were used by Radical Ent. to get all their Maya work into some other formats then finally into .P3D which is a usable game format and secure.

Any help with extracting textures specifically off the mansion would be great!!! Thanks!

Hi, I have been looking around for textures from this game also- all I really need is the montana face texture, maybe the attires if possible too and I'd take whatever I got it from- PC, XBOX, Wii, whatever 

I don't have the game right now or half a clue how to do it myself. Was just hoping to skin a caw in SDVR with it.

I'm just on the first rung of the ladder here. If anybody could help me with this or to just give me some basic pointers to learn from, I'd be very thankful.


Edit: Eeeeee    Didn't notice the year of last post. Sorry to gravedig..

I am working on the RCF and specifically RSD formats with a new app that will be able to extract the RSDs out of the RCF then OGGs out of the RSDs.  I'll look into repacking the formats and other types in the RCF eventually...

Edit: I succeeded in this...  It extracts RCF files properly (files are proper length and extracts all files), extracts all OGGs out of the RSDs changing their names, and created a method to rename all 116 songs to their proper name.  I just got to slap a GUI on it and release it...

I looked at P3D and it isn't something I can manipulate quick and easy.  If I decide to extract P3D, it will be later.


As far as archiving (packing) goes, there's a few things that have me concerned (namely, the URIs and floats) that I wouldn't feel comfortable creating without knowing where those values come from.  If my suspicions are correct, I would have to get a list of every single URI currently in use and make sure no new URIs collide (assuming that's what those are).  The floats, I have no idea on.  They are very out of place.


Edit: The first version that can fully extract the OGG music files (RCF and RSD) formats is ready to go but there's something wrong with uploading so I can't publish it yet...

I just ask yourself, and staring at the file name does not match the file offset. Then I notice your article, this is a done deal.  I have the same specifications of the unknown. Fill a 0x800 block file, I can add anything to it. Nice one.

It currently can extract RCF and RSD formats.

Not meaning to revive and old thread, but Scarface Extractor will overwrite extracted files that have the same names. I recommend the folder structure be preserved (obtained from .rcf), and Incrementally converting .rsd files within folders 'c' and 'd' as those appear to be the only folders containing files with conflicting names upon conversion with the above mentioned tool.
