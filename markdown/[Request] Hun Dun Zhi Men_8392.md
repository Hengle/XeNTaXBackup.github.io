filenames are obfuscated so no luck with them:

```
getdstring NAME NAMESZ
get DUMMY long
get FILES long
for i = 0 < FILES
    get NAMESZ long
    getdstring NAME NAMESZ
    get OFFSET longlong
    get SIZE longlong
    log "" OFFSET SIZE
next i
```

lol all of these recent games keeps screwing around with their data.

The archive he uploaded is just a bunch of DDS files so maybe someone can figure out how it's done.

It may not even be ascii lol
