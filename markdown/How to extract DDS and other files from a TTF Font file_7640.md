- Post Title: How to extract DDS and other files from a TTF Font file?

Alright, I'm not so familiar with forums so I dunno where to post this, hope that's the right place.
See I've been trying to translate some games recently and I always face troubles about the font, cuz  I'm translating to Arabic.
So, I was thinking to extract the files from the windows TTF Font files and then use them in creating the new font for the game.

Sorry for bad explanation but that's the best I could do :S
So anyone can help? Thanks in advance!

If you want to catch letters from windows fonts and put it in some DDS, well, PrintScreen is really powerfull thing
