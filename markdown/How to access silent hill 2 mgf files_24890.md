- Post Title: How to access silent hill 2 mgf files?

I want to localize the PS2 version of Silent Hill 2
but the PS2 version is compressed in mgf file. 

Unlike the PC version and the XBOX version, this is a compressed file, so it is not easy to access. 
The PC version and the XBOX version are unzipped files. 
Is there any way to access the mgf file?

I don't really know what sample was provided here, but MGF seems to have been solved at least in theory.
