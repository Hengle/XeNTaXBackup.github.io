- Post Title: Industries of Titan - quickBMS scripts

Was curious about sound in the recently-launched game Industries of Titan. I could find no such information online. This seemed like a good place to jot some down, seeing as how I found what I did here.

The .PAK the game's assets are in is Unreal 4, but some unusual format that gave me some trouble. Eventually, a specific QuickBMS script worked. Finally, the sound is stored in BKHD Wwise packs. Found a QuickBMS script that worked for that also.

I am a rank noob at this software, have edited nothing, and am likely doing everything completely wrong, so one of the reasons I post here is to see what potential for improvement is here.

Thank you for your resources!

Hello, First of all thanks to you for starting this article. I am interested in Industries of Titan game. I want to translate this game language from eng to thai. So now I can unpack the pak file but don't know the correct way to pack it back. Can you teach or guide me? Thank you (sorry for my language I am not good at English This is why I try to translate this game)
