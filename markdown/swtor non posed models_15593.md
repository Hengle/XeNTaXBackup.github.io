- Post Title: swtor non posed models

Hi all,

Anyone know of a way to get character models out of swtor that are not t-posed.

Have ninjaripper working fine but do not want the t-posed model but the model as posed in the game, i.e. riding a speeder not standing in the middle of it

I don't think it's possible to do that with ninja ripper.
