- Post Title: X-Heroes .primitives

I've successfully imported the .visual file and seen the bone.I differentiated them using hex editor .I differentiated them by some special files name.
As akderebur said Finding the correct primitives/visual pairs is up to me.
But I find .primitives files not have any name,Only have data.So I can't Finding the correct primitives/visual.  
And I try to rename them to import but failed.
So,How to preview .primitives?That can make me to differentiate them
And Maybe some .dat files contain .anca(animation)?How to open it?
Importantly,How to merge primitives/visual in blender?
This is samples  [http://www.mediafire.com/file/paygy9mne ... s.rar/file](http://www.mediafire.com/file/paygy9mne8a435c/files.rar/file)
Besides, I think have many files in .bag not get.Have better one to unpack .bag?

The hashing the games uses is unkown.
The only thing you can use is ekey's bag unpacker.
you then need to edit the file that contains file names.
you can find names of files by running the game and doing a string dump or just looking at the file references in other files using a hex editor.
I did this with the game wildfire.
