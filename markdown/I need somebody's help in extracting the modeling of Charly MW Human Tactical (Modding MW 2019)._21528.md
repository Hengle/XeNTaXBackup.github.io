- Post Title: I need somebody's help in extracting the modeling of Charly MW Human Tactical (Modding MW 2019).

Hi guys, I have a problem to see if one of you can solve it, if you want, I tell you that I want to extract the modeling of Charly MW Human Tactical, but ... I don't know why it doesn't appear in the store, and of course .... as I am so impatient when waiting for another store to rotate, well ... I ask that if someone has bought this skin, I can pass the 3D modeling of this skin of Charly, I will be Very grateful if they pass it to me. Well ... whoever wants to help me with this happened my Discord, which is this: SrRobinson#9194 here you can send me the model I want, since in this way I am much more confident when it comes to contacting you frequently. Thanks for the answer, I hope you help with this, since I can't find any way to extract this modeling, regards.
