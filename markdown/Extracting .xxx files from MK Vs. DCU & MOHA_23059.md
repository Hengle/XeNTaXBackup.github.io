- Post Title: Extracting .xxx files from MK Vs. DCU & MOHA

Hi everyone,

There are two games I want to make full audio rips of containing .xxx files. Mortal Kombat Vs. DC Universe and Medal of Honor: Airborne.

This has been the most helpful to me so far, but I'm brand new at this sort of thing and am not sure how to proceed. I've tried those tools, but it seems I need a game-specific script(?) to make extraction possible. I care about this enough to learn and really give it a go, but am fighting off the feeling that what I wish for may not be possible.

I know someone has extracted a basic soundtrack from MK Vs. DCU before, so that can be done. I want to go further though, getting the narrator's voice calling out character names, yelling "Fatality!", etc., and hopefully making more from the source files than MP3s.

You probably mean QuickBMS script. Here you can download it [http://aluigi.zenhax.com/quickbms.htm](http://aluigi.zenhax.com/quickbms.htm)
and here you can read documentation on how to use it [http://aluigi.zenhax.com/papers/quickbms.txt](http://aluigi.zenhax.com/papers/quickbms.txt)
