- Post Title: Incredibles: Rise of the Underminer HIP/HOP files.

Hello folks. Recently I've been looking into this game and trying to access it's archives. Unfortunately I know no program that does so and at the moment I'm a bit strapped for cash. I was hoping someone here could help me out with these files. I'll provide one of each here so you can take a look at them. I'm not quite sure what will be in which file. But at the moment I'm looking for Concept art files and other things like models perhaps.

HOP file:
