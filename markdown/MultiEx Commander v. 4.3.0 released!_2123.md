I just registered last week. ( I didn't know there was a new version coming out).   Do I need a new registration code for the new version?  The old one doesn't seem to work.  And otherwise it hardly seems fair.  THough I suppose I can just keep using 4.2 instead.

Well, in principle, you can't use the old code on the new version if you install it on another computer. However, if you install the new version on the one you previously installed the older version on, you needn't register the new version.

Yes it is on the same PC.   But the old code doesn't work in the new version and the old version didn't detect anything to upgrade to.   So should I email you about getting a new code or am I missing something?

(I guess maybe this should have been in troubleshooting... Sorry)

Thanks

You are right. With 4.3 comes the online WIKI base, and other older versions are now unsupported. Mind that the 4.2 version was more than a year old.

10.06.06.07

I can only hope that someday, someone will add a BMS or anything relating to the .LOT file extension.  I have no way of knowing if the new 4.3 has the capability of decoding this extension, but if I received some indication that it did, I might be persuaded to make a donation.

The soundtrack for Throne of Darkness is something that should not be buried in the unmarked graves of file extensions never mapped.

Well, have you posted a request in the Game Requests forum? You'll also need to upload a sample archive or a part of one...
