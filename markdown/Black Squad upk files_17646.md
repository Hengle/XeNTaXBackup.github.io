- Post Title: Black Squad upk files

I can't extract Black Squad upk files using umodel. I found this topic: [http://www.gildor.org/smf/index.php/topic,2459.0.html](http://www.gildor.org/smf/index.php/topic,2459.0.html)
Now I am wondering if it is possible to decrypt files somehow, maybe they are simply xored or something and it is possible to use custom bms script.
Here is startup.upk: [http://www.mediafire.com/file/3z7avqzsq ... tartup.upk](http://www.mediafire.com/file/3z7avqzsq48jhje/Startup.upk)
If somebody could look at it, I'll be glad. Thanks in advance.

you need to post a dumped exe first, without the code that reads the upk how should anyone guess it?
