Hi,

I have just installed this game and i have take a look on the .bus files with Ultra edit.
Some .bus files are multiple Gamebryo File Format, Version 20.6.0.0 (Nif files) and the other .bus files are just a pack of dds (DXT1, DXT3 DXT5).
JaederNaub can rip the dds files from the DDS_Textures.bus files.

Bus files are just archives.
You can upload them if you want.

There is not much support for the recent nif versions.
Even nifskope is busy with other more important things.
