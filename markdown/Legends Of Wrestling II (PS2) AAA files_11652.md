- Post Title: Legends Of Wrestling II (PS2) AAA files

This is kind of a continuation of the thread here ([viewtopic.php?f=10&t=3841](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=3841)), regarding Legend Of Wrestling II's archive format ADB which housed a combination of VAG and AAA audio files.

As stated in the thread, aluigi made a QuickBMS script to extract the files from the ADB archives. According to the original poster, the AAA files were compressed ADPCM. He made a thread here ([viewtopic.php?f=17&t=3877](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=17&t=3877)) on the resulting AAA files, unfortunately someone deleted the original topic.

HCS apparently posted the following about the AAA files:
Frequency: 48000
Interleave: 40
Offset: 68 

Fast forward to now: I am actually trying to extract the exact same thing, the ADB archives. It does work, however the resulting AAA and VAG files don't play on vgastream or any other audio player I throw them at. I am curious if I did something wrong.

I've uploaded the adb files [HERE](https://mega.co.nz/#!M9wlyaKL!vPqhmLZTgPd6oi9y-NJr_faF0_9ivfY7jjg77fBZ4nQ), and [HERE](https://mega.co.nz/#!8kpVnC7Y!qAm0aOiVTJo8UW_M3gBEjvXqohG1QOtkmLvTw3ilMe4)'s one of the AAA files it churned out that doesn't open.
