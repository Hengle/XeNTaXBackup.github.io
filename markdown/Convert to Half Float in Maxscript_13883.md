- Post Title: Convert to Half Float in Maxscript?

I'm not sure if this is the correct place to ask this, but I was wondering if there was any way to take the value of a UV point and convert it to Half Float? I haven't seen anything about this for 3DSMax so I'm unsure if it's even possible to do in it.
