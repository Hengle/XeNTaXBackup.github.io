- Post Title: World of Guns: Disassembly

I have a [paid "Full Access" account](http://anonymz.com/?http://store.steampowered.com/app/304310/)Â of [World of Guns: Gun Disassembly](http://anonymz.com/?http://store.steampowered.com/app/262410/) on Steam (which means I can access all the guns in there).

What's attractive about it is that the guns are very accurate and their internal structure is completely modelled unlike other models out there

I want to be able to rip all the models in there. Can you guys teach me how?

If I can successfully rip it, I will upload it to mega.co.nz for you guys to enjoy too! 

There are over 100 guns in this game!

--------INFO 1--------
The game is built using the Unity3D engine. There are multiple .assets, .assets.resS and .resource files. I tried various extraction tools, but it doesn't seem to contain any gun models. But note this is my first attempt of ripping game models, so I may be wrong

--------INFO 2--------
I tried an experiment. I made a duplicate of the game's directory. Then I launched the game from the original directory

I opened a gun that I never accessed before, and the download screen appears like usual, downloading the new gun.

Then I closed the game and compared the two directories, but nothing changed except the log file.

So where did the game download the gun models into?

This game requires resources is encrypted, decompiled key to access the files inside it

Really? Do you know how to do it?

After further research, it seems the gun models are stored using the Unity Web Player cache files. Anyone know how to crack those open? I heard some success stories about it

The offline PC version on the other hand, called Gun Disassembly 2, stores the gun model using .ivy files.

So which one do you guys think is easier to rip?

The data file is encrypted and can only be open for the decryption, there is no other way to open, you said that success should be extracted after decryption others' success, IVY file is easy to extract, but inside the model format is uncommon, should be a kind of custom model format, each component need to adjust the script to open, want to extract is almost impossible

This Russian guy from here seems to have successfully ripped it using 3D Ripper DX

But I tried it myself but I can't get it to work
And I have no means of contacting him, since not only that I can't speak Russia, but I can't even make an account there

No, I think these files may be in the game, the game is higher than the accuracy of the model to show him another model, this model is not the number, the number of components of the game single model is very large, and not only these things, can be seen from the map and the number of texture details

What? That kind of hurts to read. I'm assuming you think that the model isn't from the game. But it is, I've compared it with the in-game model and it matches 1-1. And besides WOG is probably the only game out there with the internals fully modelled

His web site model only one model agree with the game, the other model is the other games

I'm currently using 3DVIA Printscreen to rip from a game called "Gun Disassembly 2" and "World of Guns"
It ripped the mesh perfectly, but it's not ripping the textures for some reason

3D Ripper DX doesn't work on "Gun Disassembly 2". When attempted on "World of Guns" the game restarts as if it detects injection. 

Ninja Ripper ripped the textures but cobbled up all the models parts

GameAssassin doesn't work either on "Gun Disassembly 2". When attempted on "World of Guns" the game also restarts as if it detects injection

Is there any other "Screenshot" style ripper out there that I haven't tried?

Guys, as of now 3DVIA seems no longer working, can someone confirm?

I have been working on the same problem with you, do you have any progress?
I think is better to work on the ivy file and the format inside it.

This might help

Not long ago I ran into a Facepunch thread on WebArchive [https://web.archive.org/web/20190407051 ... Ripping/2/](https://web.archive.org/web/20190407051613mp_/https://forum.facepunch.com/dev/qxsv/World-Of-Guns-Gun-Disassembly-Model-Ripping/2/) that went into some depth about ripping files and their textures from Gun Disassembly 2 using Ninja Ripper, I remember one guy got it to work on an M16 model where he got all the meshes and textures, however like you said the meshes were cobbled and not in the correct positions. Though another guy got it to work on something like 50 different models if I remember correctly and multiple other ripping programs were mentioned, so it looks promising. But I couldn't make total sense of all the talk of ripping and such since I'm relatively new to it  . Hopefully you guys can understand it though.

If you guys make any progress on the process of ripping meshes from World of Guns however I'd love to know as I'm currently at the same sort of roadblock with trying to rip an AN-94 (which unfortunately is not in Gun Disassembly 2) mesh and internals from the game for reformatting into a 3D printable file of it's parts

Woah dude thank you! I totally thought this thread would be a lost cause after so long especially with the website shutting down soon. (Not to mention I forgot my account login, glad I signed up for email notifications).

You just made my day.

Also, Iâm curious, when did you first find this thread?

I'm very glad that I could help you!

At the beginning of August I decided to get started. Not without the help of my friend, of course, but it works.

I saw a thread on the forum a long time ago, probably more than a year ago.
