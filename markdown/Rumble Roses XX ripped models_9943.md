- Post Title: Rumble Roses XX ripped models?

Hey guys, now I know its possible to extract the rumble roses XX models, I was just curious if anyone has the extracted version of the EVA outfit from metal gear solid 3?

There's a link, the outfit I'm looking for is the first one. I've searched all over the net, found rumble roses ripped models, but not the EVA costume. I've been wanting the EVA 3d model ever since I first played MGS3, but since that game is impossible to rip, this is my next best option. Is anyone able to help, or know where I should be looking? Thanks!
