- Post Title: Does anyone remember Milkshape 3D?

[https://mega.nz/file/0ewlhLYb#HVydQZXk- ... 0BbmwA0Ib4](https://mega.nz/file/0ewlhLYb#HVydQZXk-nt1uaUvEBRZ5w2A273MCDeRu0BbmwA0Ib4)

I found Milkshape 3D, one of the oldest programs that used to export skeletal meshes for games such as Half-Life (1998) and id Tech-powered games.
Does anyone know when the first/last version of Milkshape 3D was released?
