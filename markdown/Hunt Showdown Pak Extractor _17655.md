It must have a new key. and the config.pak wont extract either.

Keep bumping this thread won't make any difference unless you upload some sample files.

Sometimes I really wonder what the heck you guys are thinking. If you're looking for help, why not just make it as easy as possible for people to access to the files? 
It might be a different case if there's someone good at this kind of stuffs also interests in this game, but a long silence of the thread after you bumped it over and over again still hasn't teach you a lesson?

You have to forgive me for being unpleasant.

You would need to run the game to decrypt it anyway, don't?

Here's simple one:

I was wondering if I could run ninjaripper around EasyAntiCheat. Any info on that?

You sure the files are encrypted? I can still see a PKzip directory signature here:

Maybe the data is compressed with other algorithm, but I'm not very good at that kind of stuffs.

So it is possible to unpack the files? I am trying to write a script that calculates the angle for esplosive crossbows, so you can use them as a mortar. But I need info about how the projectile trajectory is actually calculated ingame.

You can try another small file which is from another directory.

[https://ufile.io/viqem](https://ufile.io/viqem)

You want that crossbow data for an aimbot or such?

Same structure here:



eocd.jpg (91.78 KiB) Viewed 487 times


But the data is encrypted for sure coz the signature at offset 0x61983 is not 0x02014B50.
This is the file structure of the pak archives:

```
long 	end of central dir signature(0x06054b50)
short	number of this disk
short	number of the disk with the start of the central directory
short	central directory on this disk
short	total number of entries in the central directory
long 	size of the central directory
long 	offset of start of central directory with respect to the starting disk number
short	.ZIP file comment length (alway to be 0x910)
char 	.ZIP file comment
{
	long 	Size1 // 0x8
	short	Count1 // 3
	short	Count2 // 1
	
	long 	Size2 // 0x84
	char 	Hash[0x80] // MD5?
	
	long 	Size2 // 0x884
	char 	Data[0x880] // Encryption keys?
}

```

So the file should be a PKzip archive with custom encryption on all data except for the end of central directory record. 
Knowing the decrypted data of some certain fields, like the first 4 bytes must be 50 4B 03 04, and the 4 bytes at offset of start of central directory(0x61983 for scripts.pak, 0x88C for config.pak) must be 50 4B 01 02, might help a bit in determining the algorithm and the keys. But since it's not simple XORed, I'm afraid this's the best I can do. You should look for the experts for further help.

Okay, I know it has been a while since the last reply but I have good news. Like many other CryEngine games, Hunt Showdown has an RSA key in its files that unpacks the .pak files. And I found the RSA key with the guide by atom0s:[http://atom0s.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=11&t=223](http://atom0s.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=11&t=223). And I altered the PakDecrypt with the new key and it worked. But since my game is not original and old by version. It won't work most of the time. But I am also working on a tool that automatically grabs the key and unpacks the .pak files. I'll provide updates as time goes on. But if anyone wants to download the current version of the PakDecrypt for Hunt Showdown, here it is(for 1.2 version of the game):[https://www.mediafire.com/file/l8lvi1b2 ... t.rar/file](https://www.mediafire.com/file/l8lvi1b2xwd9hfn/PakDecrypt.rar/file)

Did you ever continue your work on the extractor? I used it on Hunt and while it extracted the files, I'm not sure it worked. After using CFG-converter they dont have any triangle data

Hello, nothing happens when I use the "huntpakdecrypt.exe" file.  a command prompt just flickers for a second.  HOW THE FREAK DO YOU OPEN THE PAK FILES FOR HUNT????????????????????????

Drag and drop on it and it will make a zip, done.

I'm pretty new to this all, so possibly i do something wrong here;

With the help of the guide off atom0s, I got the latest RSA key (version 1.1383). I change the PakDecrypt this let me unpack the files (kind of). 
But when I try to use Cryengine-Importer (after using the Cryengine Converter) get an error: maximum recursion depth exceeded while calling a Python object.

So I when checking the files, still see a lot of rubbish in it. Possible that there is some other level of encryption on the files. Or did is something wrong?

I just checked as well, was curious, the KEY hasn't been changed since beginning, still works, nothing new.

It doesn't just work that way, magically, the structure of the archive has been changed perhaps, that's why no proper extraction, could be wrong, but its same as the new EVOLVE Stage 2 game, the KEY has always been the same but they changed completely the archive structure and nothing works to decrypt even to this day with out fully reversing the changes.

If you got that far then, could mean you did something wrong, might as well re-trace your steps and try again.
Bottom line there's no proper unpack-er for this game, you will encounter lots of errors trying the above you mentioned.

Looks like the RSA key has been changed with the latest update of the Hunt: Showdown (Test Server) on Steam. This will most likely mean that when the live server is updated, the RSA decryption key be changed on there as well. If someone could update the Hunt PAK decryptor, that would be fantastic. It'll most likely use the test server RSA key.

The key is the same on 1.6, but now they changed the file structure completely - like Evolve.

Also on patch notes:

```
Over the last few months, we have been working on improving many different aspects of Hunt, one of those being a focus on improving our security and internal anti-cheat measures. We have made some changes to the encryption of the .pak files in Hunt, and these important changes are the reason why a full client download is required for everyone.
```


So RIP

Yep, pretty much, since its online only game no one will touch it, anytime soon at least.

Except for cheatmakers... Basically what's crytek is doing - making it difficult for normal users to browse gamefiles(who are not going to use it to make an advantage ingame), while changing nothing for people who are making cheats. I know it because i'm pretty often (because of high mmr) getting shot from the angles and through stuff that normal people won't be able to shot through. EasyAntiCheat always was and always going to be a trash. Personally - i'd like to make a couple of renders with assets from HS, but now it's basically impossible, because like hell i'm paying some scammer for questionable tool (i'm talking about guy that "made an universal pak extractor tool" with stolen scripts...) and besides that i completely lack of decoding skills.

So yeah - RIP.
