Hi Everyone 

I tried opening the DS game with Tahaxan but unfortunately there were only these types of files inside

* .dsa ( which i think is the character files )
* .dse
* .bin
* .dsf

I just want to know if there is any other way possible to extract the models either

a. using tahaxan 
b. using an extractor


thank you very much people of Xentax

Bump!
That's exactly what I've been trying to do I came just where you ended.

I've seen people here dumped most of DBZ games , even Raging blast, I was wondering if someone here happens to know how we can dump files from Ultimate Butoden (DS)
