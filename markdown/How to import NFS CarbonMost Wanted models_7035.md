I have searched around and found this website:
[http://www.zmodeler2.com/?mode=downloads](http://www.zmodeler2.com/?mode=downloads)

This is a model tool to edit the models from nfs. The current version should work with both games named above.
Just take a look at youtube or at the forum to get handy with the tool.
Hope this helps.
