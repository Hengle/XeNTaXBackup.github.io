- Post Title: game support request (.SPR)

ive found a nice online game called tibia which ive been playing for awhile now... there is a none-official site which has files for it ([http://www.tibia.de](http://www.tibia.de)).


on this site i found a modifyed tibia.spr file which had new graphics in it

i would be very happy if someone made MultiEx Commander work with this since i want to add my own graphics to tibia.spr


the www to the game is : [http://www.tibia.org](http://www.tibia.org) and then goto downloads.
