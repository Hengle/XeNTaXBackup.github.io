- Post Title: unpacking NES roms?

Hi,

Is there a generic script that can take a NES rom and unpack all the individual files within?

extract/inject

This would be great.

Some, but I discovered there'a a wealth of programs out there that work with NES roms. Perhaps they are worth it.

I'm still investigating in the subject of 'mappers', which is really awful I think, as there are a lot of them. It's not that straightforward to extract stuff from NES roms. 

In the meantime, check those other programs.
