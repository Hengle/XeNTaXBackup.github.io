- Post Title: Fire Pro Wrestling World PS4 Save file extraction?

Hello everyone. I have a decrypted save file for the ps4 version of firepro wrestling world. I'm pretty sure that all this is, is an archive holding the actual save data that is very similar to the steam version of the game. I would like to see if I can get the the save files from inside these archives and then resign them for use in steam like i have ps4 saves for the last of us, spider-man and GoW etc. Can anyone here let me know of a tool or pythin script that might be able to extract these files?

Thanks for uploading.

I thought it was a platinum game save but hardly any of the missions have been done with s ranks so no good for me.

Thanks anyways though
