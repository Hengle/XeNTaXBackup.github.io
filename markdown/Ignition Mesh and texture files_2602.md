- Post Title: Ignition Mesh and texture files

Hi:

It would be great if anyone could "decode" the mesh and the texture files from ignition. I think the MSH file has the mesh and the TEX file has the texture. The demo of the game could be find in [this website](http://files.filefront.com/Ignition+Demo/;3595734;/fileinfo.html)

I'll send two files to look.
