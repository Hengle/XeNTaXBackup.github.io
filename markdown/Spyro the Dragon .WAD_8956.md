- Post Title: Spyro the Dragon .WAD

The game Spyro the Dragon for PSX uses this file, WAD.WAD . It can be scanned with PSound for sound files, but PSicture finds nothing and the main reason I want to get into this WAD is for the textures. If someone could write a QuickBMS script that would be nice =)
