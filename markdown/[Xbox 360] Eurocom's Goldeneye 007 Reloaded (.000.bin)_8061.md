Hey there.

Eurocom is at it again. After [Rio's archives](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=8026), which used version 12 of their ill-famed Eurocom archives, Goldeneye 007: Reloaded conveniently uses version 13. Version 12's script doesn't work on it, of course.
I hope to see this format cracked soon. 

Here's a cut from the archive containing the music: [http://www.box.com/s/0mvs7kgjqpkqxzc4tnuu](http://www.box.com/s/0mvs7kgjqpkqxzc4tnuu)
Just tell me if you need a bigger cut and/or other files. 

Droolie.

the key is vmfekg53098yt7549gvb14y485gj54gj4590gu65ug4675ghjft2906hj9657h6b but looks like something changed in the encryption because it no longer gives the correct results.
so I can't help for the moment.

Thanks for finding the code, I can see where you found it 
I have no idea how to continue though. Has anyone got an idea?
