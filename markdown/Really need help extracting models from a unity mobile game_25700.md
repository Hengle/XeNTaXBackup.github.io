- Post Title: Really need help extracting models from a unity mobile game

I'm trying to extract the 3D models from a unity mobile game (Dragon Quest: A Hero's Bond). Unity Asset Studio doesn't work because it says "no unity file can be loaded". I have looked through the game files and think that I have found the assets, but they are unusable in their current state. I found the files in a folder called "blob" that was inside a folder called "files". 

I have attached a sample of what I think are the asset files

Please any help or guidance would be appreciated
