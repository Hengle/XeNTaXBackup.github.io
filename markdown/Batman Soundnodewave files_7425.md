- Post Title: Batman Soundnodewave files

Hi, I need some help with this game, I got the soundnodewave files, and I'd like to extract sounds from them.
Now, I already did all the topics research, but I found nothing about this.
The only thing that I found, is a quickbms script, to convert the soundnodewave in xma but, obviously, it doesn't works
(no it isn't obvious because I extracted a lot of sounds thanks to that program  ).
I downloaded the UDK too, but I'm not able to import soundnodewaves, I don't even know if it's possible to do it, but I remember 
I read of someone who has been able to open a soundnodewave with the UDK(he doesn't told about the process).
Now please tell me if it is possible to open these sounds or not because it is not clear to me.
Here's one of the files, take a look and thank you for any help you would give me:

if its from pc version of arkham asylum, its either a FSB at an offset after a FEV file, or just plain ogg. arkham asylum on 360 i haven't a clue about. probably xma and fsb.

Hi, yes it's from the pc version, I tried to rename it to .ogg but it doesn't works.
Do u know maybe how to convert it?should I use an hex editor(please explain if I need to delete or insert something with the heditor)?
thanks  

EDIT: finally they play!yes you were right man, they're plain oggs thank U
