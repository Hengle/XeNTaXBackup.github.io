- Post Title: C's Ware's Lucid Motion "neo animation engine"

Lucid Motion is a video format used by C's Ware in various SEGA Saturn and PC games, like Desire and Eve Burst Error. It's capable of 640x360 8-bit color video at 15 FPS, has a .vid extensions and a tVid header. I'm looking for a way to play back video files in this format. Any help is appreciated!

Sample: [https://mega.nz/#!cclCHY4D!znn6yADiDJKX ... HiphAcccZk](https://mega.nz/#!cclCHY4D!znn6yADiDJKXUEoRfeXHwv0PJGD2NHXJ1HiphAcccZk)

How it should look like decoded: [https://mega.nz/#!4M9GhDRb!ae24CqOSxrJO ... Tc62ziQ_7k](https://mega.nz/#!4M9GhDRb!ae24CqOSxrJOPqM3dbWWeGklbCA_D9DnBTc62ziQ_7k)
  (This was recorded straight from "Desire" so there may be lost frames)

EDIT: It seems that some of Desire's cutscenes are actually 640x480 pixels big, but everything else is still the same as what I said above.
