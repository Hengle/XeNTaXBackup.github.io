- Post Title: (Wii) Rock Revolution .bank files

I've been attempting to open this files with various .bank extractors and yet didn't managed to get the files inside extracted, tried to open with Audacity as RAW files to see if I can open but I can't discover which hz and Endian is.

Here I got some samples for you to see.


Thanks in advance.
