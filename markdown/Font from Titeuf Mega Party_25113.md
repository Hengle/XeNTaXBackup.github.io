- Post Title: Font from Titeuf Mega Party

Hello all! 

I am looking to get the Zep font which I have been looking for everywhere on the internet, I searched for so long, that I ended up getting the latest game and extracted the files easily as it's Unity engine. 

All I could get it this atlas file (attached).


Is it possible to get a ttf file out of this? And are we sure that the actual font file is nowhere in the game files? I didn't find it but I'm noob so maybe I missed it...


Thanks!
