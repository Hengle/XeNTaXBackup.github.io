- Post Title: Steel Saviour (2004,shump) (.aaf (Packed), .wav (IMA-ADPCM))

Hi!

Tried to rip music from game Steel Saviour (2004, scroll-shooter), but there is 2 difficultes:
1. .wav game sounds packed/crypted with some method in resource packs .AAF format. The header or respack "ATQ_AAF"
2. When started game and dumped memory - there is some raw IMA-ADPCM streams, without RIFF/WAVEfmt headers, so it's harder to detect them and add normal headers.

"extra.aaf" file as example from game.
and 
"intro.wav" (ripped music from memory)
