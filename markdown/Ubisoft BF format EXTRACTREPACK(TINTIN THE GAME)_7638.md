I have just finished to write the script for QuickBMS:
[http://aluigi.org/papers/bms/tintin.bms](http://aluigi.org/papers/bms/tintin.bms)

the only 2 things which are not perfect are:
- the number of files for the last package, I have used a simple NAME == "" check
- the type 6 files like the various c*.bin files which are compressed but they don't use the lzo one of the others

anyway the result is ok so it's was only a technical note :)
