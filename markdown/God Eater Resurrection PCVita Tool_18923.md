Tool for extracting models from God Eater Resurrection, both PC and Vita versions. It might work with God Eater 2 if the format is the same, but I don't know. I only tested it with bunch of character models. Finding the model files is hard since the archive unpacking isn't that great.

Unpacking

Use this script to unpack .rdp or .qpck archive : [https://aluigi.altervista.org/bms/god_eater_2.bms](https://aluigi.altervista.org/bms/god_eater_2.bms)

This is the most problematic part. The archive gets unpacked for the most part, but folder names and file extensions are horrible. Most of the stuff has .ixo extension (including models) and you can't identify the model files easily because of that. So just try to load them in the tool until you find a model. From my experience files that have "ND" in their name are mostly models, like : "NPC_003ND.ixo".

3D Models

Load .ixo files with the tool, and the model will appear in the preview, if the file contains model data. You can export the model to SMD format. Noesis works fine with SMD. So I would recommend it for loading/converting.

Overview :

Textures

Textures are in GXT format for Vita and DDS  format for PC. Both can be loaded with Noesis. Some texture files don't get unpacked properly though. Btw PC version has higher res textures.

It looks like they're using flexes/morphs for facial expression instead of bones, any plan on tool update make it exportable?

Tbh I wasn't planning to work further on this, since the models aren't that great. Still I haven't worked with morphs before, so it might be a good practice for me. Animation data also doesn't look too hard.

I will take a look at morphs and animations some time. Can't promise a date for an update, but I will update the thread if I ever add a new feature.

I haven't. Morphs seemed like too much hassle to achieve too little tbh, especially for these models.

I am working on other stuff at the moment, and have no plans to return to this game. You probably won't see an update anytime soon.

It would be great if you could put a video on youtube about how to use it.

What are the instructions?

Is there a note in the RAR about how to use it?
I'm just starting to use this site so I don't know
