- Post Title: Frozenheim - how to open & edit (.uasset/.uexp/.ufont) font file?

Hi everyone.
I wanted to say that I had a problem.
Recently, most games put their fonts in difficult files.
I told you the names of their formats.
And the problem I have is that I can't unpack or edit these files.
I spent many hours solving this problem but I still have not found anything to solve my problem.
Can anyone help me in this case?

File Formats: .uasset/.uexp/.ufont

Just change extension from UFONT to TTF and then edit this file using High-Logic Font Creator.

No text is shown in the game.

Maybe you did something wrong while saving new file.

You need to save it as TTF and change extension to UFONT.

I did not do anything wrong.
But maybe the problem is the game itself?

Maybe, it's hard to tell what is the real issue here.

Try to edit the font file with different software. I use GlyphrStudio.

Remember to change the extension. Windows explorer defaultly hides file extensions so maybe you just added .ufont at the end. Making it Bebas_Neue_Cyrillic.ufont.ttf

Other than that, I dunno what might be the problem.
