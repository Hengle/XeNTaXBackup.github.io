Hello,

As you can see I'm new here and so I'm probably asking for something that's already done. I have the Left Behind EF demo and the sound and data files are in .pak, but all other attempts to open it via pak extractors (Pakscape) has failed. How can this be opened?

Thanks to whoever cracks this mystery...or is it?

Thanks

OK, let's try this again...

I hope this is what we need to solve the mystery...

Thanks!

you must XOR each byte of the file with 0x8c, the result will be a normal .zip file
