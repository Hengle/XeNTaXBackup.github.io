Hi
Here is unpacker and importer for models from this game.
It requires Blender version 249b and Python 2.6.6.
How use:
1.click Blender249.blend
2.in Blender Text Window press alt+p and select:
- lfm_order.bin - for unpacking archive00.bin
- FILE_PS3==>ACTION==>MODEL - "_mdl.bin" - for importing textured and rigged models.

Script decompress _mdl.bin and *.g1t files with offzip. [http://aluigi.altervista.org/mytoolz.htm](http://aluigi.altervista.org/mytoolz.htm).
All decompressed files are move to folder ,where is blend file.

Thanks for this! I had a little trouble getting it to work and wanted to share it here in case anyone else was having the same issues. 

-If you have an archive00.lnk (shortcut) instead of archive00.bin then rename it or it won't extract properly. I had to use the command prompt rename mine.
-No spaces in the folder names! While I was able to extract the .bin file with spaces in a folder name, it wouldn't when trying to extract/load the models. Removing the space fixed it. 

Probably a couple of "no shit..." fixes but just in case, there's the fixes! Again, big thanks to Szkaradek123 for this script (and that Unwritten Tales script I still need to check out). Once I figured out the issues I loaded a few models and all was well.

offzip just splits C_AS0A_0A_MDL.BIN up into about 20 near to useless 16k .dat files.

maybe concatenate the dats in the order given by the address in their names, dunno.
