- Post Title: Gilbert Goodmate

I try very long time to translate the game GOODMATE GILBERT & the Mushroom of Phungoria with a hex editor.
But every time I failed in my attempts at translation (game crash after modification).
The translated text is readable in the hex editor.
Could someone explain to me how to make a text extraction with quickbms?
I can't, despite the tutorials to understand how to proceed.

thank's
