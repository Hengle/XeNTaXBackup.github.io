Hi all, 

As we were shut out from Google Adsense income today for false reasons, we are looking for new ways to keep up the Game Research Forum. 

If any of the members have got some good legal ideas on how to proceed, like ads, a donation system or other sources we can try, do not hesitate and provide us with tips. 

Best regards, 
Mike

How about xentax t-shirts? Oh man I'm sure people would love to walk around with a xentax shirt.
I'm sure there's someone here with connections!

I will love to buy some coffee mugs with some opcodes on it or a code for a random archive compression in c++ 
Anything related to this forum, you know what I mean.

That's actually a pretty good idea. I'd love a XeNTaX shirt. And a XeNTaX mousepad. And beer mugs.

Also, I've used CafePress for custom shirt designs before. I was happy with the quality. Don't know how they compare to other services otherwise though.

Not to be ungrateful or anything, but what is your realistic cost of hosting this site?  Were you running this site purely from ad revenue?  My host is about $100 a year, and that doesn't seem like an exorbitant amount.  I'm not a "regular" or anything so maybe I'm missing something.  I only visit the site when I get an admin email that reminds me this site exists, but I don't want to see a resource like this go away either.  Just curious.

Maybe you know this already, but with the Amazon Associates program, anytime someone comes from XeNTaX and then buys something from Amazon, XeNTaX would receive about 5% to 10% of the price from Amazon, without the customer having to pay extra.
I am sure that every visitor here buys something over Amazon, and just by following a special link before check-out they would be able to support XeNTaX. 
See here for more information: [https://affiliate-program.amazon.com/](https://affiliate-program.amazon.com/)

I agree with amazon affiliates. although, do this for the .it and .co.uk domains as well, if buying from the US I have to pay additional customs fees, and can't possibly help.

If you're looking for something to replace the ads, I've used a place called AdBrite in the past. You could check them out. Personally, I wouldn't go with CafePress. You only get 10% of your sale amount, no matter what you have the price set at. Just my 2 cents, though.

I use a few advertisers - Intergi, who have a minimum user requirement, and CPMstar who do an alright job - better than Google did when I used them.
If you need to reduce costs, I have my own dedicated hosting server which I could offer to you at a heavily reduced rate.

While I've had a falling out MrAdults, it doesn't mean anything about this, don't worry.

I'd be more than happy to help you guys out.

How about open a Blogspot and use the Blogspot ads to earn money? 
Per example, relevant topics being posted at Xentax Blogspot and the users doing their part, visiting and commenting the blog so many times be possible.

It's always ideal for projects like this to have it's own server. Or some free server in big companies where there are thousands of servers with tons of free resources (maybe someone knew admins).
Or just find out sites with same subjects and collaborate with them to kept up. Then costs will be divided so many as many sites will include collaboration.

Man I remember when they blocked my Adsense account for my website because someone was spamming it. I've tried other alternatives such as Adbrite and they're nowhere as good as Adsense. In the end I just chosen to accept donations which a lot of people kindly did.

I'd be happy to donate to this website as I've always found it of great help.

Might this be an appropriate time to look at switching hosts, as well, Mr.Mouse? I know we're having some trouble getting any support with the wiki from the current hosts, but other than that I don't know how their QoS is.

If the answer's a "yes", I'd suggest [Curse](http://curse.com), which have experience hosting gaming fora and wikis, and I could get you in touch with one of their community managers (at least, I think that's her job); Curse covers the financial and technical costs of hosting, allowing the community to focus on the content.

hi im Dr.Emuler a S.T.A.R.S Modding Team Member.

Well my english is not really good but im gonna try to expose my ideas properly.

1.-Youtube adsense. 
but make new account upload tutorials, or demo videos and make money with that.

2.-Enable a paypal donation system.

3.-Use ADFLY.COM in the forum links.

4.-Enable the VIP members that have special features and of course that have a monthly cost.

5.-in the last of chances sell the content :S

thats my ideas.

about the "legal" of this site in some countries modding is not a illegal action but in some countries yes.

so if the webmaster is "payng" for the host, i suggest move it to russian server or something like that and open a new google adsense account because in that country modding is not illegal.

i hope this site still open running its very useful.

How about AdFly ?

In my country, people used it too much for earning money.

The AdFly will plus point when other people click a link.

Maybe we should attach "AdFly" to some download links in the forum.

But i suggest the forum should open a donation system

I'd be more than happy to help you guys out.
While the decision of what to do about XeNTaX ad's/hosting is ultimately Mr.Mouse's (and/or the other admins here), I want nothing to do with you and don't want Noesis anywhere near you or your hosting, and I would definitely never allow you to host Noesis or anything relating to it.

I wouldn't exactly call your refusal to cease openly and vigorously violating copyright law a "falling out". You're a huge liability to Noesis and any community you touch. I won't deny that I personally hold you in disdain for your irresponsible views, but I also see you objectively as an incredibly dangerous influence. Your mentality is also openly encouraging people to redistribute copyrighted content as their own and even offer it to others who don't know where it came from. This is even a danger for indie developers that may happily accept content donations only to find out that it came from another commercial game. I also don't imagine you're quite so stupid as to be overlooking all of the *very many* harmful consequences of what you're doing, nevermind the simple fact that it's plainly illegal, and you haven't a single positive thing this theft provides that Noesis itself couldn't *legally* provide for users who legally own the content in question. This makes me question your agenda to an even greater degree.

I have no desire to continue this dialog with you, but I do have a desire to ensure that you have absolutely nothing to do with Noesis or XeNTaX.  I'm not going to ban you, but I am going to make it a point to assert my opinion that you are toxic and that no one here should have anything to do with you or your site(s).

Thanks to everyone so far for some intriguing suggestions! A lot of cool options, and the t-shirt and mug thing is really a fun idea as well. We will explore the options. The website is not in any danger of shutting down at the moment, just so you know. 

Some users are happy to see GoogleAds make a mistake though, judging from our "member" tempo that sent this message to us:

Although I'd certainly buy a mug and shirt, the last post has a high amount of truth in it.
Is there some possibility to externalize the "code" tag? I'd like to suggest AdFly together with pastebin for code. I personally wouldn't mind to go via AdFly to get QuickBMS or java code. If it's somehow possible, you could disable the AdFly link for the author of the post. To get a better readability of the posts, it would be extremely helpful if the link could directly open INSIDE the forum body so that you'll view the pastebin content like normal code as now.

Is buying priority tickets for scripts, or temporary exclusive use of scripts, legal?
Basically buying the access to expertise for expedited solutions to novel problems....... 
Membership?
I know more than a few people that come here as their first port of call to access content that gains them prestige in other areas, and I've seen that when more than a few people jump on a 3D thread, scripts are made within a few days if not hours. 

Other than that I can only think of getting sponsorship from somewhere, if that were game companies it would need to be from ones who encourage modding/fanart.

Can't afford a T-shirt

There are more than 15000 registered users in this site.
If 1/15 of them donate 1$ a month it would become 1000$ a month.
I think donation system can be the first option to try and if it didn't work out we can try other possibilities.
And I'm sure there are people that gladly will donate mare than that.

What about eveybody paying $1 per year? That's $1250 per month. I can't think of any reason why somebody wouldn't be willing to pay that less for a forum like this.
Additionally you could make specials like no fee if somebody is an active member. And what could be a better method than to base the yearly fee on the received thanks? People will have even more reason to contribute!

So basically you are saying that we could make this a members only forum with members that donate a yearly sum ? By request doesn't work, we've seen in the past. And there are also some countries where it is difficult to donate to us, technically. Lastly, we'd have some kind of system in place to track who donated or not if we would opt for a closed forum/invite only forum/application only forum.

What about a "Bounty Board"? People offer [x] sum for research, and the user only gets the results of said work when they have paid the researcher and offered [x] (a percent of the bounty) up to Xentax via PayPal. It wouldn't replace existing forums where research can be done for free, but for those with specific, less popular games needing research it may prove to bring in a bit of income.

What is the cost for the server?
-What would the recommended donation average?
5, 10?

I'm not too experienced with donating.
Most sites that accept donations use PayPal or Google Payments.

I hear a lot of site admins talking about how little they make off any advertisement program.
Most people have adblockers installed in their web-browsers and don't usually click on any ads.

Some sites that do opt-in for Ads will usually get their site flagged as "malicious" when using Google Chrome.
Largely because the Ads will rarely have an advertisement that contains malicious code.

I'm game for PayPal, I've had no problems with donating via PP.
I'm from Canada, and so far there haven't been any limitations.

Xentax products sound nice.
A mousepad is always in need of renewing.

Not sure if you already noticed it, but it looks like the Google ads are back! 
Did Google re-examine the site and noticed we don't host any illegal stuff, or did you do anything, Mr. Mouse?

Good of you to notice. Yes, we asked Google to re-examine our site after the measures we took to comply. They did a thorough analysis and concluded we now abide to their policy. That means that we were successful in routing any illegal activity, and our mods have continued empowerment to crack down hard on any who do not follow the rules. We want this site to be all about helping in modding, but not anything not legal. So, welcome again to a fully legal site!
