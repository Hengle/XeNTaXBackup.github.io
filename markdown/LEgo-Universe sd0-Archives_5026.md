I succesfully managed to find a way to unpackthe files manually.
If you have a patcher you justhave to extract the library.zipwith a archiver kile 7-Zip and call at the command-line:
lib_segmented.pyo -d input_archive output_archive (with path and extension)
The working path should be the one whereyou extracted the library.zip
You should use python 2.5! (2.6 gives weird errors)
I upped one extracted and repacked library.zip (some files are decompiled to look in!!)
Ifyou knowhow to read the hash-table you can pickthe interesting files from the server directly.
But thats an other topic....

PS:the library.zip for the ones which didnt have it

Exactly what files are "the files"?

EDIT:
Nevermind, I read your other topic and it is all quite clear.
I'll try it out.

And one more thing... What exactly can be found in those files, once extracted?
