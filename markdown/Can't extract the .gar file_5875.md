- Post Title: Can't extract the .gar file

Hi there,

I just downloaded Farming Simulator 2011.
I think all of the game's data is stored in .gar files (I tried with 7-zip,winrar,winzip), but I don't know how to unpack the stuff.
Can anyone help me?

Example file: [http://www.multiupload.com/SYN9LIXDLH](http://www.multiupload.com/SYN9LIXDLH)

I want to make the translation of this video games to play in Turkish language.

Thanks in advance.
