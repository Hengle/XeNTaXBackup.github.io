First, I might not be able to explain well because my native language is not English.

BMS and script were used to extract related models and textures from IFS files.

[https://aluigi.altervista.org/bms/monst ... r_nifs.bms](https://aluigi.altervista.org/bms/monster_hunter_nifs.bms)

This is the BMS Script and BMS Version I used.

And this is the result.

Can someone help me?
This is my first time using BMS.

Here's a link to the ifs file I used.

After posting this question, when I searched a few more, 
I thought that "IFS2.dll" would give someone more information, so I upload it together.
This file is the dll that I downloaded with the ifs file.

Tools made for the English translation patch, should work.

I tried it but I got only xml and text files.

I got the entire game installation file, so let's share it here.

Please help anyone.
