- Post Title: [PC] Tony Hawk's Underground .MDL files

Providing here MDL files from THUG: [http://www.solidfiles.com/d/dd929474f5/](http://www.solidfiles.com/d/dd929474f5/)

I tried opening them with almost every MDL importer, no luck at all so far.. Noesis plugin will be greatly appreciated. Thanks! Just ask me if more files are needed.
