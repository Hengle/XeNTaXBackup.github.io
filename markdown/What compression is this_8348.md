- Post Title: What compression is this?

I have managed to get the decompressed version by accident by tricking the game:

```
[cCore, INIT, STRING] (24)		DeveloperName = "Default"
[cCore, INIT, STRING] (100)		MapName = ""
[cCore, INIT, STRING] (100)		Language = "British"
[cCore, INIT, STRING] (100)		StartupScript = "empty"

```

This is just a small snippet.

It looks like a form of RLE compression, any help working it out?

Thanks.

Oh har har. I'm not talking about the image, I mean the file I'm showing in the image.

upload the file or at least the compressed data (the complete compressed data) so that I can give it a quick scan with quickbms

Thanks for having a look mate. I have included this particular file(the whole archive is about 200mb, so I don't really want to upload the entire thing) with it's original null padding in the archive, a version without it and the uncompressed version. Everything should be correct down to the byte.

Cheers.
