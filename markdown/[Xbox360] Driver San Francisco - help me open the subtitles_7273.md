- Post Title: [Xbox360] Driver: San Francisco - help me open the subtitles

Hi

It's my first post here, and I'm sure it won't be the last 

Recently I joined a fellow group of enthusiasts who are translating PC and PS3 games in my native language - Bulgarian (Cyrillic).

I on the other side am interested in translating them for the Xbox 360, but of course some extensions are a little too much for my Google skills 

In this particular post I want to ask for help opening the subtitles of Driver San Francisco for the Xbox 360.

I'm providing the English [subtitles.astd](http://www.mediafire.com/?6rmjidn5b79yaqs) file, which as far as I know is some kind of an image file. 

The whole localization can be found on my FTP server:

IP: 93.152.186.94
username: xentax
password: xentax
port: 21

If you have any problems with the ftp, please say so.

I'll appreciate any type of help!

Thank you in advance
