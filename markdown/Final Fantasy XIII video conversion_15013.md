- Post Title: Final Fantasy XIII video conversion

Hi Friends,

I am new to the game modding and all.

I am trying to extract the video files from the FF13 .wmp files and read about bink tools.
I tried after reading some threads on Hex Editing and converting to .bk2 format.

But when I play I hear only background music with video (no vocal audio is present)

So, I believe the vocal audio is in some other file or I may be doing something wrong.

Help needed to achieve the same
