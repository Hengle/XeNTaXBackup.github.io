- Post Title: Final Fantasy VII (PlayStation) lzs and bin archives

Hello, all! 

Would it be possible to add MultiEx Commander support for Final Fantasy VII (Playstation Version)? There's two archive formats I'm interested in unpacking, and I've included examples in an attached .rar

First, there's the lzs archive format. This should contain simple polygon files. The example "Stage20.lzs" may contain one or more pre-rendered backgrounds instead, but that's just a guess.

Second is the .bin archive. The file "FIRE.bin" might contain animations, polygons, and/or textures for one of the game's spells.

Thanks for any help you can provide!

Although there are many tools on the net for FFVII and FFVIII they are normally for the PC version...not so much the PSX version..
Though in this link ive provided there is a tool for the PSX .LZS files.. i think there is one for the .bin files aswell but i havent checked that.

Youl most likely need a combination of the tools from here as you can only extract the files from the LZS archves.. you then need to look through the list ona  suitable program to edit or view them and whatnot.

Aha! Thanks for pointing me back to Ficedula's site, lionheart. I didn't know that the Qhimm community had developed an lzs decompressor for the PSX version. 

I'll do a more thorough search and see if they've got a .bin decompressor as well.
