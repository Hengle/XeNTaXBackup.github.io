- Post Title: Voltage *.data files

Hello.

Some days ago this game was released, so I tried to make some changes in it. No troubles with configs editing, but the most interesting part lies in data files (they contain textures, animation, meshes, etc.). And here I need your help, guys 

[Download the example](http://www.megaupload.com/?d=J51WMRVO) (390Kb)

It would be very nice if someone will make extractor\packer.
Thanks.

uhmm the format of the archive is not so nice but I have made a simple script for it which works with the provided sample, script [here](http://aluigi.org/papers/bms/voltage.bms)
