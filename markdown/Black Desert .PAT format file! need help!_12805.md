- Post Title: Black Desert .PAT format file! need help!

Hi guys. I'm Source Filmmaker user in Korea. so plz understand my bad English :p 
recently thanks to the helping of XenTax community, 
I could port Valkyrie model (one of newer characters in Korea server) from the Black Desert into SFM.
but there is some trouble. that problem is i couldn't find the texture files of eyebrow, iris, pupil, contact lens, eye-line decoration and make up.
(oh yes, there is default customization texture file in dds format, so i could port in default face, but you know, 
 without the customization, black desert is like dead body.. )   
of course, i can find the other texture files (DDS format) but i couldn't find those texture files that very important to customization. 
but there are PAT files in head folders with face(head) models (PAC format).  
I believe those texture files of eyebrow, iris, pupil, and other things be used when customize the face in PAT files.   
and i noticed that there is some kind of development kit of pearl abyss (developers of black desert) in the texture folder. 
that kit's name is volumetextureconverter_release_x64 
you know, we can't open the sound files of black desert easily. because those files also been locked by pearl abyss. 
so i thought this kit is some kind of converter for sound and texture files (PAT format) of black desert. 
and i dragged the PAT files into this program, then these words came up.

It means "failed to open the texture file" 
so i dragged other format file in, and these words came up.

> 잘못된 텍스쳐

and it means "wrong texture" 
so i believe that this kit is converter for PAT files!!
but how can i use this converter? i think there is some kind of code for this tool. 
because i noticed that this tool require some kind of other files. these words came up when i just double clicked the tool. 

> Assertion failed: c_str, file C:\pa\trunk\code\3rd\boost\boost\filesysyem\v3\path_traits.hpp, line 194

and yes, I don't have those pa folder and other files.
but developers of pearl abyss have those files.. 
so.. if there is someone who can rip these PAT files or this tool. 
plz help me~!
