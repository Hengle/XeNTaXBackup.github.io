- Post Title: Problem with .upk and .tex files [Saw Game & Manhunt 2]

Hello,
Here`s Daniel from PLProjekt. We do fan-made translations of games which everyone can download for free. I would like to ask if there would be anyone willing to help us with making the Polish version of the games Saw: The Video Game and Manhunt 2. Unfortunatelly we don`t know how to open .upk files in Saw and how to get fonts from .tex files in Manhunt 2.

You will find the files on the server below:

Hi,
AFAIK you can't open UPK archives, because they were "cooked" with licensed Unreal Development Kit and a free version of UDK can't open it. I tried it, too (in SAW, Batman: AA, Borderlands, Gears of War). 
So if you want to translate dialogs in UPK, you have to firstly decompress them a then use HEX editor. Compressing modified files isn't necessary.
Our team is working on slovak translation of that game  And user "venomtrk" made a turkish translation for SAW, also with HEX editor.

Look at: [viewtopic.php?f=10&t=3754&p=32885&#p32885](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=3754&p=32885&#p32885)

We don't know how to manipulate with fonts, yet. 

Happy translating
