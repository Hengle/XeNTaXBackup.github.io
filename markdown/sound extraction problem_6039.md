- Post Title: sound extraction problem

Hello guys, I've got 2 problems in sound extraction, eager for ur help.

I've been quite interested in the sound extraction of Dynasty Warriors Online recently. And thx to AlphaTwentyThree and hcs [viewtopic.php?f=17&t=5523&p=45869&hilit=dynasty#p45869](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=17&t=5523&p=45869&hilit=dynasty#p45869), I successfully extract the BGM files I've been long searching for, which remains the sound files in folder 1015 the only problem.   
Since there are several .wav files in each .bin file, I would like to split the .bin into several individual .wav files. 
Here is the attachment containing the .bin file and the corresponding index file(maybe):

Any help is quite appreciated!   
BTW, does any1 knows how to split a big .wav into several smaller .wav files? I don't mean to do this manually with tools. The above .bin file can be converted into a big .wav file that combines all the smaller .wav files. Plz forgive my ignorance, but I'm quite a rookie in hex editing.

Here's my second question. I found the music in game Big Bang Beat really enjoyable, would u plz help me on extracting them? I wonder if the music and other sounds are contained in the same folders. The following attachment contains the BBB sound files and the sample for my above .wav spliting question.
