Hi, looking for some guidance on how to grab model data from Love Live School Idol Festival All Stars

[https://apps.qoo-app.com/en/app/6883](https://apps.qoo-app.com/en/app/6883)

Seen some people have done it but I'm not sure how to do it myself. I really want the model files >_<

Preferably without having to own the card corresponding with the model you want.

Any help is appreciated!

Chrrox has a topic about getting the game database here[viewtopic.php?f=10&t=21247](https://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=21247). I have tried it but it seems the data file is split. Can someone help?

Sorry for being an idiot but which files exactly to use the script on?
