Alright. I'm trying to find a way to open up old xbox disks so that i can mount them for emulators. A friend also wants them for homebrewing but i can't seem to view the files on the disk.

All i see is a 11 mb video file in windows explore with view hidden files turn on.

That'll Let You See The Files But It Wont Get You Too Far In The Means Of PC Emulation
