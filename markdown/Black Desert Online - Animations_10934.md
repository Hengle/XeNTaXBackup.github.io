- Post Title: Black Desert Online - Animations

Hello everyone!
Since I noticed already that you guys unpacked models/textures from Black Desert Online, I would like to ask you if there is a way to unpack animations ?
I mean "unpacking" by exporting it as .fbx and so on.
I hope it wont be so hard for you professionals 

Thank you,
Rynage
