Here is script for extracting files from pkz and after that from dat/dtt files (you can do it with the same script). Resulted files can be of various types, for example wtp are simple dds. If you want original naming without subfolders, edit the script and comment corresponding lines.

You may want to ask Kerilk if he has time/motivation to add support for this game's models/anims to his Noesis plugin. It supports pretty much almost every single P* game at this point : [https://github.com/Kerilk/noesis_bayonetta_pc](https://github.com/Kerilk/noesis_bayonetta_pc)

Thanks Joschka but i think he might not be interested since tools are so old.

Thanks Joschka but i think he might not be interested since tools are so old.

That's because some components didn't change for a while and P* didn't release anything since Astral Chain. However as you can see new releases have been published regularly : [https://github.com/Kerilk/noesis_bayonetta_pc/releases](https://github.com/Kerilk/noesis_bayonetta_pc/releases)

So I'd suggest opening an issue to ask whether or not he plans to support it before starting research if you're interested in this game. It'll help to avoid duplicating the reversing effort ( you can see examples of new game requests here [https://github.com/Kerilk/noesis_bayone ... s%3Aclosed](https://github.com/Kerilk/noesis_bayonetta_pc/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed) )
