- Post Title: Help with a .dat file

Hi!
Can someone help me with the [voice.dat](https://www22.zippyshare.com/v/IE6qsgrQ/file.html) from the new update of KOF2002UM Steam version? I want to unpack and repack or edit modding some files.

Thanks in advance!

You mean "The King of Fighters 2002: Unlimited Match"?

You can use FileStripper. It works fine with your file [https://imgur.com/a/8YHYD5B](https://imgur.com/a/8YHYD5B)
