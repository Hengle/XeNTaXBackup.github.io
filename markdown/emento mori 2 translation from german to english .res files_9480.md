- Post Title: emento mori 2 translation from german to english .res files

There is a file name: MEMENTO2_loc_ge.res
This is the german version of the game.

And there more res files in the main installation directory of the game.
Im pretty sure this file MEMENTO2_loc_ge.res or maybe other .res file contain the text of the game the language.
I want to translate it.


Is there any way to unpack this files ?
I searched forums and found some topics about Memento Mori the first one but all the tools i tried on memento mori 2 didnt work.
I tried: Centauri Production Resource File 3.10 Manager
Its unpacking i see the bar on the bottom moving in the end i see a plux(+) and i can see a lot of files like: D000X0000....something very long wich is .OGG
And i cant do anything with it and cant open or see .OGG files.

Then i tried the program: CenResTool101.exe
Tried to open the file: MEMENTO2_loc_ge.res but it didnt do anything.

Can someone create a program to unpack memento mori 2 .res files ? So i can retrive the text language to translate it and then to put back to the same place the text back ?
I dont know how to do it.

Thank you very much.
