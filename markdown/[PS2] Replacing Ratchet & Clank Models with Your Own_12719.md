- Post Title: [PS2] Replacing Ratchet & Clank Models with Your Own

So, I'm someone who still has a PS2 and the original Ratchet and Clank games. I'm a huge fan of the originals and have been looking for a way to give the first one a refresher. So I thought, "Hey, why not go in, and replace a model or two (i.e Ratchet) with one of my own and do a playthrough?" Immediately after I thought, "Wait, is that even possible?" (Now I do have FMCB installed on my Playstation 2 memory card so I'd be able to run the modded version game.) So my question is, if I have a model (of equal quality, or lower, to the one(s) in R&C), could I go in and replace one of the models in the game with it, then be able to play as it? (Basically I plan on replacing Ratchet's model.) If so, how would I do it? (In my mind, I picture that the new model with it's textures would have to be the same names, and formats, of the originals, that way the game will actually call on and use the new model and it's textures.)

Same I still prefer the ps2 ratchet games over the others. I had plans to extract the ps2 ratchet games however its not easy almost impossible. So modding the game isn't going to be easy.  As for the Ps3 HD remake they store model files in moby.dat files and textures are chunked in vram.dat

Well really, you'd need something to export the models from the format that the engine understands, to something that is usable within 3D editing packages. Once modified you'd then need some additional tool/code to export it back to the engine's format.

I know I pulled out the meshes for one of the PS3 Ratchet and Clank games. Never looked at the PS2 ones and sadly don't intend to but it'd be interesting to see.

Goodluck
