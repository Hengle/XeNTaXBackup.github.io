- Post Title: Far Cry 3 - .SPK Unpack/Packer.

Hello,

I've been routing around for a variety of .SPK packer and unpackers. None have worked for FC3's files. I'm trying to access the sounds, such as weapons, so I can put my own into it or listen to their other sounds. OggExtract only extracts Music and not sound effects etc. If there is a way in which people can access these through an unpacker, could someone point me in the right direction?

I can upload an .SPK file if needed.

Worked fine for me, the files won't be named though, just like far cry 2.
