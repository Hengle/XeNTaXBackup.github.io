- Post Title: Marvel Avengers: Battle for Earth (Wii U) .nif models and .kf motions

Hello

I tried importing these nif and kf files with NifSkope, Noesis, and Blender. But while the .kf files works, the nif file won't import. I'm aware that there's already a NIF2OBJ converter for this game, but I'm looking for a way to extract rigged models with animations. Can anyone help me figure this out?
