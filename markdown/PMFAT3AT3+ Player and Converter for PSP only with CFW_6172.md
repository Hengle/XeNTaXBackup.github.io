- Post Title: PMF/AT3/AT3+ Player and Converter for PSP only with CFW

If this is not the right place for my post an admin is more than welcome to move my post to the correct place.

The original converter is the work of Junk2ool so if you want to give credit to someone give it to him.
A few changes were made from the original to suit some needs, you can read about them in the readme files inside the rars.

I like to thank for their tuts and unprecedented help to watson and cozy (both from PSPRipkits) and also Alphatwentythree.







To use it:

1. Unrar the folders
2. Copy/move the folders to MS:\PSP\GAME in your PSP
3. For AT3/AT3+ copy/move them to MS:\PSP\MUSIC in your PSP
4. For PMF copy/move them to MS:\PSP\VIDEO in your PSP

As a side note, PMF/AT3 Converter v0.7 is also a PMF/AT3/AT3+ player, so if you want to listen to those AT3/AT3+ you can do it and if you want to watch those PMF files you can do so too.

Thanks for using our apps.
