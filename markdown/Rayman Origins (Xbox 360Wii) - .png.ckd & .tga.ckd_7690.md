- Post Title: Rayman Origins (Xbox 360/Wii) - *.png.ckd & *.tga.ckd

Hey again,

[Thanks to aluigi](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=7672), I was able to decompress the IPK archives from Rayman Origins.
Some files (sound and music) are uncompressed, but especially the artwork looks compressed.
I don't think they're in a separate format - judging from the filename (png, tga) they're known formats, just very compressed.
And the artwork is what's best about Rayman Origins, so I'd definitely like to extract it.
So I made two archives with some compressed images in them.
Here is the one from the Xbox 360 version: <link removed due forum rules violation>
Here is the same one from the Wii version<link removed due forum rules violation>
The Wii version files are maybe in a different format (DDS? But why is it still named PNG then?) but still compressed.

It is possible that they are in fact just image formats that I haven't heard of before, and that they're still named PNG and TGA because those were the original formats, before conversion to Xbox and Wii. If you know anything about this format, please tell me. 

Can anyone help?
Thanks!

they (checked only those of x360) look like uncompressed raw dds files.
check them with a hex editor

I've tried them with numerous DDS file viewers but with no luck. I also have been looking at these, though with the Wii version. If there is any way to view them, please let us know!

I did check them with a hex editor, but I have no idea how I can change these to readable DDS files...

x360 texture files are DXT compressed, and can be converted to dds, but they are not dds.
you need to add a proper header to this files so they will become dds.
you may ask for help in [Graphic file formats](http://forum.xentax.com/viewforum.php?f=18) forum
