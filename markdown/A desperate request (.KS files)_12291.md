If possible, could somebody try and make an .MP3 to .KS converter? I will attach 3 small .KS files that totals to 233 KB's in size when decompressed. If you need one that is bigger, just ask.


 KS Files.7z
Three .KS files:gameovr1 = 85 KBgameovr2 = 78 KBgameovr3 = 72 KB (181.52 KiB) Downloaded 24 times

This is very helpful, I'm reading it. The story feels like I'm going further deep. The front track is quite a lot.

i should've been  a bit more specific; I want a program that can convert a normal .MP3 file into one of these .KS files so the game will play custom music.
