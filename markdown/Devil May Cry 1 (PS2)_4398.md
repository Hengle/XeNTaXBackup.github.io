[AFS Explorer 3.7](http://downloads.moddingway.com/file/270.html) can unpack the afs files.
But I never tried to repack, because this is an old AFS format (the names of contaned files are not stored).
The images are in tim2 format. The Xnview can handle them.

The same thing with DMC2.

Thank you, but DMC 2 & DMC 3 have a different format and also different creators from Devil May Cry 1. so AFS Explorer doesn't work with DMC1.
