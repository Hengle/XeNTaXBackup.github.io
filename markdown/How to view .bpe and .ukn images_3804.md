- Post Title: How to view .bpe and .ukn images

Thats right, I've managed to extract the .bpe and .ukn files from the PACs from WWF Smackdown !2 iso. What this means is that it is very possible that I could have extracted textures from the wrestler models in game. What i'm trying to do is find a tool of some sort that can view the images within the .bpe files and .ukn files. i do believe that this would make it possible to make quality SD!2 Mod which is nearly impossible with the textures from CAW mode.
I've included a rar file of the extractions from the DENT PAC for anyone who wants to take a shot at finding anything. Help is very appreciated.

I've read up on the subject in the smackdown vs raw 2010 .bpe again topic. I've downloaded the tools that were posted but am not too sure on how to use them. I tried opening the .bpe files that were extracted from my C2.PAC and DENT.PAC files with quickbms and unrrbpe but nothing happens. I would like to upload some files and have them tested if someone cares to help. I would really like to find something.

Here's my Dent.PAC
