Please someone help us with reversing language file. Thanks in advance.

```
http://www27.zippyshare.com/v/TufOXhHl/file.html
```

The output may looks like this:

```
//

{
	"
	"	"\t"
	"#str_online_mapinfo_desc"	"Show detailed info about the current map"
	"#str_online_changemap_desc"	"Select a different map to play"
	"#str_online_settings_desc"	"Change settings"
	"#str_online_changeslot_desc"	"Change to a different player slot"
	"#str_online_lobbytype_desc"	"Switch the lobby between public and private"
	"#str_online_rate_report_desc"	"Rate or report this map"
	"#str_snap_misc_invitefriend_desc"	"Invite friends to play"
	"#STR_SGL04_MAPBRIEF_THEGAUNTLET01"	"Adjust the properties on doors in this level so you can walk from the start module to the exit without letting any demons hit the red triggers."
	"#STR_SGL04_MAPDESC_THEGAUNTLET"	"Learn how to work with doors and keycards"
```

It's  plain text file - you can use any text editor.

each line is:
"text identification" : "localized text"

That's pretty much it.

It seems that all encrypted language files have the same header starting with 
```
W
```
, and most but english have the exact same header 
```
57 2A 80
```
 
```
W*â‚¬
```


Is it possible to find how to decrypt them with that...?

It could be encrypted with zlib because all other files in archives are encrypted with zlib, right?
