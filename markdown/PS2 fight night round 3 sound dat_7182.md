- Post Title: PS2 fight night round 3 sound dat

I've managed to extract a .dat file from the fight night .big file, but don't know how to continue. I can drag the file into Audacity and it'll play a clip, but I'm sure there are more clips in the file that I can't access. Anyone know how to extract the remaining clips? Sample included.
