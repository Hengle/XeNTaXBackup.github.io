- Post Title: Streets of Rage 4

Would like to see if able to extract the background textures from the game Streets of Rage 4.
There are only a few files for textures but they all have no extensions so I made a sample cut with Wattos File Cutter of the main files that have no extension they might help find how these are compressed.

There are 5 files here: [https://www.mediafire.com/#q0sg7m4zjdrl9](https://www.mediafire.com/#q0sg7m4zjdrl9)
Thank you

Here you go;

[https://github.com/Jayveer/SOR4TEX/releases/tag/1.0](https://github.com/Jayveer/SOR4TEX/releases/tag/1.0)

you have to run it from the command line like so;

SOR4TEX textures texture_table

As it creates directories it may need cmd to be run as admin.

Thank you JayK for your extractor, it works flawelessly!
The output files are a variation of .XNB but with a custom header or something. 
I haven't been able to convert them with the current available converters. GXView from the GameTools Suite can open them but it displays them incorrectly. 

Here is a .zip file with some samples of those .XNB files:
