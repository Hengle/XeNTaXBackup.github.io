- Post Title: ARKdumper "Failed to execute script arkdumper" error

I'm still trying to unpack .ark files from Gameloft's My Little Pony game but now I know what the problem is.

I'm getting the "Failed to execute script arkdumper" (only saw it through screenshots due to appearing for a split second) error when I try to unpack the ark. files, failing to unpack the files and resulting in only empty folders. The Value error being "Not enough Image data".

is there a problem with the software or the app that I downloaded? 
 I need help resolving this issue
