- Post Title: Request: Havok Tools

I am looking for Havok tools frameworks, the one that can open hkx files.

However, havoc has been shut down by Microsoft (Who also shut down my access to Community Support, and wont allow me to create a new microsoft account for some odd reason...)

I was wanting to know if ANYONE out there has the Havok Tools Framework software that can open hkx files...

I am working with Final Fantasy XIV, trying to tinker with the models and animations. But I've hit a snag... exporting the pap files with FFXIV Data Explorer yields a pap.hkx file. I cannot open this wirth the latest version of neosis, or even the general modeling programs.
