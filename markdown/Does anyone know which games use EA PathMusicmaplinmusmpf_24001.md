- Post Title: Does anyone know which games use EA PathMusic/map/lin/mus/mpf?

I am trying to build a list of games that use the EA PathMusic system (which has .mus and .mpf/.map/.lin files in most cases)

Games I already know of that use it:
Command & Conquer: Red Alert 3
Command & Conquer: Red Alert 3 Uprising
Command & Conquer 4: Tiberian Twilight
GoldenEye Rogue Agent
Boogie
SSX On Tour
SSX Blur
Need for Speed 2
Need for Speed 3
SSX 3
SSX
Skate 1/2/3
Skate It
Need for Speed Nitro
SSX 2012
Need for Speed Underground (most likely, not 100% sure)

Does anyone know of any other EA games that feature .mus, .mpf, .lin or .map files for audio, the or that are known to use the EA PathMusic/Pathfinder system? There will be files in this system that have PFDx or xDFP as a header (some are big endian, others little endian)

I am not asking for or requesting any files, just trying to build a complete list of games that use the EA PathMusic/Pathfinder system.
