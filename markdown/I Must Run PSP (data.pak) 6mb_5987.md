- Post Title: I Must Run PSP (data.pak) 6mb

hi xentax members 
i hope you guys can help me with this file its a .pak file found in the game "i must run" 
it is only 6mb and it would be nice if someone can take a look at it and perhaps make a extractor and packer for me
i read the tutorial for quickbms but i think that i have to read it again and again until i understand how everything really works

data.pak 6mb
