- Post Title: Legal Question

I have reverse engineered a file storage system for an MMORPG.
It uses both encryption and compression. 

I then wrote a small utility to break any updates or other files that use this method, and it works great.

My question is this: Is sharing this utility on the internet illegal? (In the U.S)

[This](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-circumvention) page makes it sound like it is. I can think of a dozen or so ways to get the program out there into the web anonymously, but I'd like to take credit for breaking it as long as it's not going to get me hunted down and sued.   

Any insights?

Many have reverse engineered something around here and haven't received problems. But I dunno. It doesn't SEEM like something they can sue you over, isn't like your distributing warez or something like that.

Do you really believe they spend money for sueing you? I think they'd rather change the encryption once it is broken.

And besides, it's not like you're using your utility to rip graphics, sounds, models, etc. from thier files and distributing them... That's one thing we don't do around here.

Alright, thanks for the feedback everyone.

Looks like I'll just release it and take my chances.

A final reply. I figured out the Painkiller encryption format at the time, not reverse engineered it, but just deduced it logically. I then created Painfull, an extractor of files in their archives. ( [viewtopic.php?t=732](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?t=732) ) I even posted the first message on their own boards, so the authors were fully aware of my actions. 

I did not get sued, instead they were forced to change the method in the next patch, and they did and that was that.
