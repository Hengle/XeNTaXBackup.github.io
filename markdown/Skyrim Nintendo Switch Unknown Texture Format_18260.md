I'm looking for help in trying to get this texture format to a DDS

Here is the Unknown Switch Texture : [https://anonfile.com/E1XdVbeeb4/alduin.dds](https://anonfile.com/E1XdVbeeb4/alduin.dds)

And here is what it should be : [https://anonfile.com/B4X8Vfe2bc/alduin.dds](https://anonfile.com/B4X8Vfe2bc/alduin.dds)

It looks like the textures are Nvidia Tegra X1 Texture format files (which makes sense since the Switch is running a Tegra X1).
Seems like [https://github.com/aboood40091/XTX-Extractor](https://github.com/aboood40091/XTX-Extractor) might be able to do something with them.
