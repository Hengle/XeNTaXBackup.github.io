- Post Title: Red Steel 2 .DSP

Here are quite a few dps files from this game, according to a post on hcs forums, theys eem to be similar to beyond good nd evil's dps, but instead they have missing coef tables. Now i am not that much experienced with gc/wii codecs, so if someone can tell me where to acquire or how to build these tables? could it be on the wii iso itself?
