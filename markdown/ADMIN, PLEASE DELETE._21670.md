I did have a script somewhere.  I'll try to find it.

There's also sound fx and speech in the .STR, .SND and .SPK files in the "M" folders.

This script should extract any CLU archives.  Give it a try!

Hi.  Yes, I've had a look at D:BH, but it is a very complicated format.  The index itself is easy enough to get the individual files, but it's putting all that together that's the hard part.  If I have time I will look into it further as there's probably some good music and dialogue to rip from there.
