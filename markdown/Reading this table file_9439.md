- Post Title: Reading this table file

Hello everyone,

This is my first post here. I wanted some help regarding this text table file that I have extraced from this game and need to read its contents, but I feel its encrypted (it is stored in .txt format). Any idea's on how to go about decrypting it to plaintext?

Thanks

Done. [Here](http://www.progamercity.net/game-files/4958-release-9dragons-encrypt-decrypt-tool.html) tool. Remember if you make a request to Decrypt or Unpack file you need to specify  the game name or link for download client (game).

No need to lock it. 

Personally, I'm curious as to details of the encryption used; d'you think you could post a quick rundown, Ekey?

Aah, that makes sense. I thought the oh-so-obvious patterns didn't jive with any "serious" encryption, but I don't have the skills to actually be able to recognize xor on sight. =/
