- Post Title: Croc 2 ASF Sound

Hi,

Croc 2 is a game for the PC and PS1 developed by Argonaut software. It has music in ASF files, but they're not windows media. [here](http://www.mediafire.com/?n1dnx4ceka9xbyd) is an example, the music that plays at the title screen.

The file is supposed to sound like [this](http://www.mediafire.com/?bd9h836a69dunbd). I have tried importing it as a raw file into Audacity, and I can almost make out the sound of the trumpet when I import it as a Î¼-law encoded ADPCM file, but it comes out nothing like how it should. Can anyone here find out more about these files, or how I should go about decoding them?

I realize this is five years too late, but it would be nice to see the Quick Macros source code to that converter, so the format may be more easily added to VGMStream. It seems to be some sort of Microsoft ADPCM, but I can't be too sure without looking at the decoder.
