Hi, can anyone here make a unpacker/packer/editor for .DCT file from Pure???
It should contain only text, but I didn't find any suitable app for it. 

Thanks

I got also german .dct file. Maybe it will help to somebody.
Also i compared english and german .dct and there are some identical sequences. Maybe it's divided to chunks. But if i rewrite some word in HEX, and add one char to it, text in the game is messed up
