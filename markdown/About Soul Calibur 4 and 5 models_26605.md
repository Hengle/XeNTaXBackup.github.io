- Post Title: About Soul Calibur 4 and 5 models

I pretty sure the program used to rip SC4 and 5 models is long gone,however what was the program used to extract both of those games? and was it possible to use Noesis to convert them?

Hoping to try to get the creations parts as well as the weapomns that haven't been ripped before not just chars
