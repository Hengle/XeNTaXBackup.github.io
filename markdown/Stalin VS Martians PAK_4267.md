- Post Title: Stalin VS Martians PAK

This controversial yet rather entertaining and silly parody RTS game has got me thinking. I would like to be able to use the graphics in the game in a short comic, and perhaps a few features.
In the following links you will find the main pak file that I believe contains most game data. I am expecting standard files within.
I had to split them into two RAR files to manage an upload.

[http://www.filefactory.com/file/b0ddbfg ... .part1.rar](http://www.filefactory.com/file/b0ddbfg/n/pak0.part1.rar)
[http://www.filefactory.com/file/b0ddd90 ... .part2.rar](http://www.filefactory.com/file/b0ddd90/n/pak0.part2.rar)

Please let me know if anything can be done to retrieve the files within this archive.

It's a zip archive, you can simply open it in WinRAR.

Well, thanks.

Unfortunately it contains unusual file types. What I'm trying to do is access the model files and apply the textures.

Anyone can look into these if they think they can figure them out. The files I've found so far are XDB, DDS (Which are easily opened with a common viewer, a google search will turn it up), and MD files.

upload a sample of the 3d files you're talking about
200mb is too much for me

the only actual model here (USSR_sapper\1.mb) is just a typical maya binary scene.

ascii file format spec:

i was looking at blender for a maya importer, but it expects the model to be exported to obj file.. which doesn't help

only converter i could find is [http://www.modwiki.net/wiki/Maya_to_MD5](http://www.modwiki.net/wiki/Maya_to_MD5)

Oh...then what are the XDB files? I assume they're a type of archive since they're present in almost all folders in the unpacked PAK.

The DDS files are easy enough to open in a common viewer.

all the formats are standard stuff.

the xdb file is plaintext xml - you can open it with any text editor. the data is just config information for the game to load its assets with.

i suggest downloading a copy of maya to view the 3d models with.
any missing textures you can manually update with the dds images you've found.

Well, turns out there's one more type of file I've found in this pak. What kind is it? I have no idea. Really, the files have no extensions. I can assume by the folder names they're the more specified model files, but I just need some information from you guys to see if I can open them properly. In this file you'll find a collection fo folders. I included all I could but I'm unsure if they're all required for each other.
