- Post Title: .SX File Type

Good Day!
I've been trying to open this file with several HEX Editors.
The filetype can be readable under HEX. But it's seems like it's encrypted.
Is someone here have time to look at this file, I would appreciate it much.

Sample files:
[http://www.mediafire.com/?z1zl6epthjb7prs](http://www.mediafire.com/?z1zl6epthjb7prs)
Contains 2 types of file;JAPAN (.SX only) & US version .SX & .SOL)

Thanks always!
