Try this, from aluigi.
to unpack.
to repack just use the reimport commando 
> Quickbms.exe -G -w -r -r  and select the same script you used to unpack.

```
#   The Walking Dead Survival Instinct
#   Country Dance 2
#   Silent Hill Book of Memories
# script for QuickBMS http://quickbms.aluigi.org

idstring "POD5"
get ZERO long
getdstring NAME 0x50
get FILES long
goto 0x108
get INFO_OFF long
get ZERO long
get NAMES_SIZE long

get NAMES_OFF asize
math NAMES_OFF - NAMES_SIZE

math ENTRY_SIZE = NAMES_OFF
math ENTRY_SIZE - INFO_OFF
math ENTRY_SIZE / FILES

for i = 0 < FILES
    goto INFO_OFF
    get NAME_OFF long
    get ZSIZE long
    get OFFSET long
    get SIZE long
    math INFO_OFF + ENTRY_SIZE

    math NAME_OFF + NAMES_OFF
    goto NAME_OFF
    get NAME string

    if ZSIZE == SIZE
        log NAME OFFSET SIZE
    else
        clog NAME OFFSET ZSIZE SIZE
    endif
next i


```
