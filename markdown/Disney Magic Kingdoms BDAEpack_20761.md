Has anyone even bothered getting stuff off this game? There are models of Ducky and Bunny amongst others whom I'd like to rip and port into SFM for one.

It's F2P so getting the client and most of the assets shouldn't be that of a pain.

This guy did: [https://www.vg-resource.com/thread-35676.html](https://www.vg-resource.com/thread-35676.html)

Although, it only works with the Windows 10 version of the files.

I also already ported Ducky and Bunny's models to GMod/SFM myself, along with Forky.




If there's enough demand, I might release them for Gmod/SFM usage   .

Lol I didn't notice that. I'll look forward to you releasing Forky and the others, though I'm kindal disappointed that some of the other characters from TS4 are absent from the game atm.
