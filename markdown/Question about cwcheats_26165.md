- Post Title: Question about cwcheats

hello, I am looking for someone who can help me solve a question, it is about cwcheats, rather hacks for ppsspp games

_S UCES-00842
_G God Of War: Chains Of Olympus [EU]

_C0 One Hit Kill
_L 0x20365CC8 0x461C3C00

OK, going into the context, I want to know how the cheat above was created, I mean, what steps did the person who created it take to reach the address of that cheat?

because as far as I know 0x20365CC8 is an address for cwcheat format but in cheat engine format the address is 1FF65CC8 depending on the memory in that istance that opens the game so it always changes... ok sorry, what I came for.. .. 0x461C3C00 is the hexadecimal value that is equivalent to 9999 in float, but the original value is 0x40000000 which is 2 in float...my question is, how did the person who created the cheat, got it, since the value 2 is fixed, I mean , it does not change when hitting another enemy so, what did he do to discover it in the first place, it is a cheat, that if I understood it correctly, I am not sure, it corresponds to the damage that Kratos inflicts, please someone help me.
