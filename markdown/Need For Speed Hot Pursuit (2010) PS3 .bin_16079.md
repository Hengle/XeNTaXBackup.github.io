once replied (using offzip) but, we need to go to next step...

I extracted VEH_1111597_MS.bin, it composed many .dat files. Probably, the largest file may be LOD0...

I think we should get NFSHP v1.2 (x360 or PS3) to be available properly for extracting DLCs unreleased on PC.
In DLC itself, .bin files contain only .dat files, but PC cars' .bin files contain not only .dat but also .cl5, .ico, and so on.

Proper files for Supersports Pack are in v1.1 update pack and files for Porsche vs Lamborghini are in v1.2 update pack.

After one year looking DLC for Xbox version. I found. Xbox 360 have diffrent 3d files than PS3 and PC. I tried export files from PS3 using Noesis with NFS HP plugins but unfortunately I can't export models. Good news is We can open, and export textures from PS3 DLC. I hope somebody help me to open models from DLC version and convert to PC version.
