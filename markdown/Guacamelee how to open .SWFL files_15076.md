- Post Title: Guacamelee: how to open .SWFL files?

Hello friends, I need help to open Guacamelee swfl files.

I extracted Guacamelee resources.dat (PC version) file with QuickBMS. There are two types of files in resources, one is .DDS files which i can open in DDSviewer. Another files are .SWFL. I tried to open with adobe flash cc2015, but it says unknown format.

Here is some files from game.
