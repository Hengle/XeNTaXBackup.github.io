- Post Title: .mp3 archive? (It's not a music file!)

[https://mega.nz/#!j9EE1KDY!zcwX0iz_OOkB ... 36PXc2rDUE](https://mega.nz/#!j9EE1KDY!zcwX0iz_OOkB6Z7elwvS8r4UlXNakF2aB36PXc2rDUE)

Hello, wondering if anyone could crack this, I need the textures from it (looks like ktx, or whatever .pkg.ktx is)
First 4 bytes seems to be the magic?
Next 4 bytes unknown.
Next 4 bytes seems to be the offset to the size table.
Next 4 bytes seems to be the number of names in the names table.
From here is a list of null separated name strings. After the last one, is immediately a list of what looks like sizes of the data?

Thanks!

EDIT: iOS the archive is called .hha, looks to be the same file.
