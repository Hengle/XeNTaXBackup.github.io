EDIT: [here are some sample files](https://sta.sh/0coggtdcqko)

I know this game runs on unity and i can open and view them in unity asset studio


but whenever i try to export them i keep getting this error on every single model


ive never had this problem with asset studio before so idk if its just the program or something in the models

I often use the same program as you, and I have experienced this problem too. Either try an older version of Meta, or try changing the FBX versions in settings on AssetStudio. Should solve that problem. May need a lil trial and error.
