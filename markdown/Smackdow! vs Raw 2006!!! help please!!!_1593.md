Compression of some type is being used on the textures.  The format is similar to the original SvR but the compression technique is one that I am not familiar with.

Having a tool to extract and import textures would be great, but it would also be great to have a tool that can import/export the text and game files. Much like Wrestlemania 21, this game has loads of hidden characters just waiting to be hacked back in....

Okay so, you have read [viewtopic.php?t=1305&highlight=pac](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?t=1305&highlight=pac) ?
The files you sent are just a collection of .PAC files.

Well i browesed all of my SVR06 file's with Game Extractor, and it show's pac file's in there, but there's another file type named " BPE " i read up on it, and it tell's me that it's a substitute file which alow's the file to be open with a hex editor and something else ( can't remember to be exact ) so i extracted a Pac file, opened it up and i find nothing the file's must be extremley embedded into the file's it's self.

The problem with the PAC files is that they aren't easily opened. Most archives have some kind of directory that lets our programs work out where the files are in the archive. However, the PAC archives don't have any kind of directory - it is my assumption that the directory must be stored in the main program or something like that.

What does this mean in regards to the opening of these archives? It means that it isn't really all that possible. Game Extractor will partially open some of the archives, but as soon as it finds an error it will just stop there - it can't go any further. The way Game Extractor does it is just to kinda "guess" where some of the files are - its a poor method but its the best that can be done.

In terms of support for this game, it will be similar to the other PAC games - there isn't really any support for them, and there probably won't ever be support for them, but definately use Game Extractor on them and if it opens some of the PAC archives even just a little bit then you are lucky 

Sorry about this mate.
