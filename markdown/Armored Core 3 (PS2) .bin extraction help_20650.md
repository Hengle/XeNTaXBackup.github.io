- Post Title: Armored Core 3 (PS2) .bin extraction help

Has anyone ever tried ripping the 3D models from the Armored Core games? I've tried searching, but I haven't found a way to extract the PS2 .bin format that From Software uses. I read that they might've used the same file system in other games, so perhaps there's some documentation somewhere. Can anyone point me in the right direction? I tried offzip, and that just extracted thousands of 1kb files. Here's what  the ISO looks like (the files from 2002). Thanks for any help.
