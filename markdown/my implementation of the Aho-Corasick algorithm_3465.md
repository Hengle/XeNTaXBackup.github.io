- Post Title: my implementation of the Aho-Corasick algorithm

In case someone is interested, here's my current implementation of the Aho-Corasick string matching algorithm written in D.
It's perfectly suited for tools like signature scanners since it is capavle of searching for several keywords simultaneously.

Thanks for that, a little late, I know, but I like this stuff anyhow.

You're welcome, sadly I never managed to actually make sensible use of that code.
Just some very simple sign scanner to test it.
