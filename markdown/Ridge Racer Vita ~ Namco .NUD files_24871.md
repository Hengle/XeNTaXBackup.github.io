- Post Title: Ridge Racer Vita ~ Namco *.NUD files

I am aware there is a Maxscript to import these already made by RTB, but he does not seem interested in updating it or changing them at all. I had posted on the VG Resource over a month ago, and in his thread. Someone else also directly poked him via Discord, so that avenue has been tried. I wanted to see if any updates arrived, and none ever did. So, I'm posting here now.

I don't quite know how to update the script or anything of the sort. It's his Pokken/Touch my Katamari maxscript, If anyone could update it so it actually works with the tracks, I'd be ever so grateful. I already pre-separated each track into it's individual NUD files, I just have no way of importing all of them. Like three or four work, then the rest import as a mess of broken polygons flying everywhere. Attached via the link below are two tracks, Oceanfront Cruise Way and Redstone Thunder Road. Should be plenty of the NUD files to see where and how the script breaks when importing.
