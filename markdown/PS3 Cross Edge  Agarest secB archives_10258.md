- Post Title: PS3 Cross Edge / Agarest "secB" archives

This is probably an easy one. I'm still trying to figure out how the offsets are stored. Filenames are in some kind of "name table" with each file only referencing into that.

Anyone want to take a shot? I can also provide more sample files if needed (the game has 19 of them, 9 of which are < 30 meg)

Here is the archive with 2 of the files (one with name table, one without):

Edit: I just noticed that the secB files also appear in "Agarest Generations of War". 
Here is a ZIP file with some more samples:
