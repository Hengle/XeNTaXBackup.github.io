So one guy made a Max Script and never released it? Doesn't surprise me, most of the RE community don't deserve shyt.

Just sayin'

Not sure what you want, but if you're asking about RE4 models, there are tons of them out there.

I was only suggesting why the scripts may have not been released.

The problem is that most Resident Evil Communities are incredibly intense. Work is just not appreciated enough to even bother release anything these days. Yes, it's only some people but that "some" is a large handful unfortunately. I have been in contact with some; if not the BEST Resident Evil modders which feel the same way. That's why projects/tools get cancelled and so many more things happen behind closed doors. I recognise your name from a modding forum I were once part of.

Enough of that. I dislike your attitude. Then again it's expected from a Resident Evil thread. You're out of line and I don't appreciate your malicious and rude response. I suggest you apologise. I still fail to understand why you require models from RE4HD... Seeing that it has been possible to extract old ones for years?

Perhaps if you explain why you needed those specifically it'd be useful.

I think RE4 models and RE4HD models are the same, just high-res textures. And I think that there are some improved RE4 models out there on the net to look like the HD ones.

they released another PC port, but this time I hear it's much better. 

the first port to PC was horrible, and all the cutscenes were pre-rendered :/ 

However I hear the second PC port is alot better, and I was excited about modding it. since it seems it uses normal maps (gamecube already had), plus the cut scenes are all active rendered now (which gamecube also already had).  

if they community hadnt driven away all its talent I'm sure someone would have looked into it by now.

I'm not "esactly the nicest person"?

Bitch please. I released various mod tools and cracked pretty much every single format from Resident Evil 5/6. If I weren't nice you would not have seen me release my tools or even help people there. You're all a bunch of pathetic retards claiming I'm a malicious and evil person! Furthermore having the nerve to spread disbelief/rumors behind my back and insult me. You're all no better yourselves....

If you look up some of the projects I have worked on aside of Resident Evil and how I am around other communities then you'd see the true person I am. Very honest and fun. I don't appreciate being degraded by your false claims. I offered a lot to you guys and some peeps just had the ordasity to throw it all in my face. I were never rude to forum members so I don't exactly know how you figure that I'm not nice. Only thing I can think of is when I got bored then trolled the staff ^^ It's not my fault that the behavior of other members influenced me to join in on the stupidity (which was purely deliberate for fun).

Simply had enough, I don't have to justify myself anymore. Go back to your trashy forum. Where are your modders? Most of the talented ones including myself have left and I hope they never come back because I ain't. That forum is nothing but a stale mess. I was only there for the people who appreciated me, not for assholes such as yourself.

Get back to crappy re-texturing you basic bitches.
