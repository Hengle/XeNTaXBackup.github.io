- Post Title: Does anyone know what program can convert .igb files?

Possibly to any file that can be opened with any modeling program, like .obj, .3ds, .x, so on? I've gotten .igb files from the game "Project Diva Extend", and I used "Intrisnic Alchemy Finalizer" to extract the contents out. For example, each model has two .igb files called "skin00_00b" and "skin00_00h". This stands for body and hair. The last digits go up for whatever number model you are extracting from. When you extract these, the skin files extract out "faceShape", "hairShape", "Leyeshape", "Lhandshape", and so on. The only problem is, once I've extracted these, they're still in .igb form. I hear that Google Earth uses .igb files, and I've searched everywhere for a converter. The problem is, not many people know what Intrisnic Alchemy is, so there's not much about it. I did find one converter for Sketchbook 3ds max, but the script didn't work. 

Please, if anyone can help me or even give me further understandings of these files types... I'd so greatly appreciate it! If this is unclear to you, I'm sorry. I tried to explain this in the best way I could. :'(

the answer to the question in your topic is no. a model or two has been hard-coded out, but no one has written a converter. the 3dsmax script is for the PS3 version of the game, not the PSP ones. btw, linking to copyrighted files/software is not allowed here. i'd remove them before the admins see them... they will ban you if they see them.

Bookazoid from deviantArt wrote a script, but he doesn't give it out to anyone. x.x
And oh, I didn't know.. I read the rules but I didn't know this was illegal, I thought the person who made the .igb files had gotten permission.. thank you for telling me. ^-^

it's an incomplete C# program, not a script. and that's the person i was talking about. he used C# to hard-code a few models out of there. if it was a general purpose script his DA page would be flooded with models like how lollipop chainsaw has flooded the XNALara forums lol.
