- Post Title: Breath Of Fire

In CAPCOMS GREAT breath of fire games, the setup of the files within the CD is simple.
You get folders named:
PLAYER
ENEMY
SOUND
MUSIC
SCENARIO
EVENTS
ec..
But withing those files is a large collection of fiels with the file format .EMI
I have tried for AGES to crack this but NOTHING happens.
So i was wondering if anyone else oculd find a way into these files at all.
I am going to try and attach a PLAYER.EMI File, the game uses 2D characters that SEEM to be BITMAPS so they really only need be converted I guess.
Ok I tried to attach but everytime I do I ant see the file for some dubm reason.

I already made a request for the format you speak of. Capcom uses it's own format of archive and images.

There I attached a zip with 2 of the EMIs

My request thread. This is one odd coincidence though XD I thought I was alone on this. O_o

I looked at the PLAYER folder at soem of the files within that,(with a HEX VIEWER).
Although this is my 1st time with a HEX VIEWER it seems that the GRAIS as it is called seems to be MATH_TBL
I am unable to find much more then that with a HEX VIEWER.
I read the tut on using a hex viewer but It doesnt explain what to DO withthe files you found, ie:How to EXTRACT them ect.
iF I CAN get to grips with this whole HEX viewer thing thne il do it myself  lol.
THo please if anyone can help please do.
Also can someone please explain to me how to attach files?
Because when I do it nothing seems ot happen its really strange.
Maybe i odnt have enough posts yet.

I have discovered (well i already knew but i forgot to mention it here) that .EMI is used for almost EVERY file in Breath Of Fire.
All except movie files that is.
Is used for 
- Music
- SFX
- MODELS
- Animations ect..
So i have assumed that it is a type of achive, tho most likely a form of compression and it always seems to have a GRAIS called  MATH_TBL or something along those lines (not sure if the "B" was needed).
Please someone tak ea look at this.
I am doing it myself but i am making LITTLE or NO progress at all here.
