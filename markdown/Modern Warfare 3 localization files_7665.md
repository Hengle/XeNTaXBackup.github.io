- Post Title: Modern Warfare 3 localization files?

Any ideas? :p

For instance in MW2 I wanted Spanish subs, so I rename x:\MW2\Zone\English to x:\MW2\Zone\Spanish copy the Spanish x:\mw2\localization.txt file and replaced the following files into

x:\MW2\Zone\Spanish

code_pre_gfx.ff
code_pre_gfx_mp.ff
common.ff
common_mp.ff
localized_code_post_gfx_mp.ff
localized_code_pre_gfx_mp.ff 

Those steps donÂ´t work for mw3  any ideas? only subtitles in videos work, menus, ingame dialogs dont.

Regards

By the way, I'd like to make fan translation for this. (Game normally doesn't support my language)
A tool would be nice.

"bump"

Is there a chance for translation tool(s) for that game or no?

The game is good but...

Simple unpack/repack: offzip.exe or quickbms.

mw2/mw3 .ff's has encryption and without key no chance to repack them. And even no chance to fully unpack (multiplayer files only)

So, is there anyone who can find this key or no one want\can?

I think that no one will translate the Multiplayer. Maybe the Campaign, all the texts for menu and the other things such a "Press a key..." and the Spec-Ops mode but not the Multiplayer part because there is nothing for translation (no dialogues, no special texts, nothing).
