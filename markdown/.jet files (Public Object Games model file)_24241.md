how about .jet
Unzip the file with any decompression software you like (might need to rename the extension to .gz first), the use the following BMS script to extract the data from the decompressed jet container:

```
endian big
get headerSize short
get Size asize
putvarchr MEMORY_FILE Size 0
log MEMORY_FILE 0 0
append
set accSize long 0
do
	get aByte byte
	get blockSize long
	savepos Offset
	log MEMORY_FILE Offset blockSize
	math Offset + blockSize
	math accSize + blockSize
	goto Offset
while Offset < Size
append
get Name basename
string Name + ".mesh"
log Name 0 accSize MEMORY_FILE

```


Using AXE on the resulting mesh file for the biggest submesh:
