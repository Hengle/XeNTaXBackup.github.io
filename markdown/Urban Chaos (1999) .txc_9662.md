Hi,

Hey, guys. Can you help me with texture replacement? 


All textures are in TXC files. We can use Texturefinder to see them:

View in game is like this:

Structure of TXC file is hard to understand, so i have thought that maybe you can come up with something. 
All txc files are in CLUMPS folder, so i'm uploading archive with all of them.

I tried to disassemble fallen.exe (main executable of this game), but i failed.
