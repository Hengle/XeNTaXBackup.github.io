- Post Title: private server from scatch

hi all.

      i was wondering if anyone could maybe shove me in the right direction on any info for taking game files and compiling them into a private server so i can play by myself. i know nothing about doing this but i also cant find any info or forums. i made a WoW private server a while back using Mysql and a data base i DLed but im not sure how to make the database from the game files. any help would be awesome thanx.
