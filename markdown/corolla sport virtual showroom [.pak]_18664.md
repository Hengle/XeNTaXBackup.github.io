- Post Title: corolla sport virtual showroom [.pak]

I downloaded corolla sport virtual showroom obb, and I found this pak file.
[https://mega.nz/#!4F03CSiK!rwmSbWEqlGiv ... G9aJZf-bjw](https://mega.nz/#!4F03CSiK!rwmSbWEqlGivxkt1lx5SboM6X0C5o4ee7G9aJZf-bjw)

it may contain a 3d model of toyota corolla sport. (because this app has AR contents)
and built with unity engine, it's easily rippable if you extract pak file.

It's definitely NOT built with Unity, but Unreal engine. You can load it directly with umodel.
Anyway here's a BMS script written before I realized the above fact, which will unpack the file you uploaded.
