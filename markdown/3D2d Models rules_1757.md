- Post Title: 3D/2d Models rules

By request, we have started this Modding category at the XeNTaX forums. This will have a test period to see if it will be succesful. 

You can ask Xela (Polak) requests if you need someone to create some models for your game!  

Be nice to him, and he may help you out! 

Also, you can use this forum to discuss any other 3d/3d models-related issues you may have. Have fun!
