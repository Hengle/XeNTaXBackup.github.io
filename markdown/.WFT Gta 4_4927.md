So i found some interesting stuff regarding .wft and how zmodeler 2 locks it.

The locked files are indeed locked but they aren't really locked they are compressed.
So locked means = compressed + bytes added

It can only be viewed with Open IV.



And please no trolling or its reported to the Admin's
