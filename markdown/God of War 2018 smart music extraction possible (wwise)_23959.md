- Post Title: God of War 2018 smart music extraction possible? (wwise)

Hello you all,

I'm trying to extract god of wars music without ending up without a thousand fragmented pieces. I have looked into WWISER tool, but:

a) the .wem files are all just laying in a folder, 5000 of them, not one of them has a full music track - they're split into smaller parts
b) I can't find sounbank.xml file or any other file "managing" the .wem files
c) I'm a newb
d) there are some other files with .sbp extension, located in the soundbanks folder but upon inspection with ravioli explorer they contain only sfx it seems

Anyone has some advice, experience with that case? Or I have to find and merge everything by ear? If so, would you recommend any DAW for smart merging files by synchronizing to a beat maybe?

Man I wish something is possibe to do, the God of Wars' soundtrack is amazing, I'd love to have it in unaltered quality.
