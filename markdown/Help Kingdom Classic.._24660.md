Hi

I want to translate the Kingdom Classic game into my language but I couldn't find the text file, can you help me?

-------------------------------------------
I found "Rewired_Windows.txt" in "resources.assets" but I guess it's hardcoded, anyone know how to edit it?

"The file is TOO LARGE!" when uploading the file. error, even though it's not even 1 MB.

Did you try to use total commander method? [https://ikskoks.pl/searching-text-strin ... commander/](https://ikskoks.pl/searching-text-strings-using-total-commander/)

Thank you for your reply. But the .txt text file does not appear in this game. I have posted the screenshot of the files below.

So it's a game made with Unity. You need to use AssetStudio or UnityEx to search for text files.

I searched with UnityEX but it is full of .cs files (and all .cs files 2-4 kb), I haven't tried the AssetStudio program.

One of these tools should work [http://wiki.xentax.com/index.php/List_of_Unity_Tools](http://wiki.xentax.com/index.php/List_of_Unity_Tools)
