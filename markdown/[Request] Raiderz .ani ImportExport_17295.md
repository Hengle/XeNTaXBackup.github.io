- Post Title: [Request] Raiderz .ani Import/Export

I'm just wondering if anyone has a working .ani importer/exporter for the latest versions of Raiderz. 

I can currently import the templates using the script posted in this topic [viewtopic.php?p=102951](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?p=102951) 
but I wanted the animations of the models and I do not know how to do it, I am willing to pay for the help because I need these animations.

Here is an example of the models and their animations that I need to import. [https://www.mediafire.com/file/w3ghrcvejkljk7y/hf.rar](https://www.mediafire.com/file/w3ghrcvejkljk7y/hf.rar)
