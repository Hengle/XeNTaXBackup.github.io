- Post Title: Little extractor program

GOBREAD is a program which extracts files from such called "container files" of many programs, mostly games.
At this time almost 100 different formats (not mentioning derivatives!) are supported.

In almost any case it is able to extract all files and fully reconstruct the file structure from a supported container file.
GOBREAD works ONLY on all 16/32bit M$-platforms since M$DOS 3.31.

Features:
- Extracts container files which have a managable structure.
- Recognizes many formats automatically.
- Decompresses files using built-in ZLIB and LZSS libraries.
- Handles encryption methods.
- Is being updated loosely.

If you are interested, you can download the latest version below.

These formats are currently supported (August 8, 2011):

good job I'm so jealous of programmers because they can make all these cool things..who knows maybe I'll be able to make something like them too when I grow up since I'm gonna become a programmer and all...well I'll test it later with some files and tell you the results...

I added Starship Troopers, because it is a good shooter and has a terrific music score.
But it is bloated with tons of duplicate files.

Here is a short list of the supported games. Some are little older, but I think it is still interesting to explore them.
I don't want to add extraction support for file types which is available elsewhere, except I can implement it in a quick-and-dirty way.


13th Century - Death or Glory, PAK-files
Armored Fist 2, RES-files
America, RDA-files
Ascendancy, COB-files
Aliens versus Predator 1, FFL-files
BloodRayne 1, POD-files
Comanche 3, RES-files (s. a. AFIST2)
Commandos and -Expansion, WARGAME.DIR
Cossacks, GSx-files
Daikatana, PAK-files
Die By The Sword, ATD-files
Dark Forces, GOB-files
Dungeon Keeper 2, WAD-files
Dawn Of Aces, TEX/TRN-files
Dominion, RDF-file
Digital Publishing, EXE-files
Das schwarze Auge, ALF-files
Giants, GZP-files
GRP-files (Blood,DukeNukem3D,RedneckRampage...)
Gene Troopers, .FS-files - <<NO DECOMPRESSION YET - PENDING>>
GUT-files (Soldier, ShadowCompany...)
Heroes of Might and Magic 2, 3
ID-Software, PAK-files (Quake,Kingpin...)
Jericho, .packed-files
Kreed, PAK-files
Apache Longbow 2, TRE-files
Lucas-Arts, LFD-files (DarkForces, Tie Fighter...)
Mortyr, file MAIN.HAL
Moto Racer, BKF-files
Monolith Productions, RES-files (Blood 2, Rage of Mages...)
Shellshock NAM67, ASSETS??.DAT-files
Nascar Racing 2, DAT-files
Outlaws, LAB-files
Pacific Storm, SMA-files
Patrizier 2, CPR-files
NovaLogic, PFF-files (DeltaForce, F16...)
Postal, SAK-files (not complete)
Privateer 1, TRE-files

Stolen, BCB-files
Tomb Raider 3, CDAUDIO.WAD
Turok 2, 11K/11C-files
Warcraft II (incl. expansion-CD)
World War 2 Fighters, SQ?-files

I also added an unpacker for "Revolution", a decent FPS. The container has a ZLIB-compressed directory table which would be to complicated to handle by GOBREAD.

Have fun.

Added:
Extraction support for "Secret Service 2" (2003), a budget shooter; CHS-/SS- files.

Now accepts long filenames on commandline.

Now recognizes many of the supported file formats automatically. This can be done only for container files which have a describing mark.

Changed:
Pacific Storm, SMA-files: There are drive letters in some file names; these are changed from e.g. "C:\..." to "$$\..." during extraction.

Added: Extraction support for XMEN2-Wolverine (2003)

The file format for this game is rather simple. The data structure consists of separated fixed-length entries for directories and files. All files seem to be compressed by BZIP2 (data) and WAVPACK (sound).

GOBREAD only extracts all files from the container and adds "BZ2" or "WV" as file extensions. After that the files have to be uncompressed by BZIP2 or WVUNPACK.
Caution: WVUNPACK will hang if a file name starts with "-". Rename such files before/after unpacking.

[http://www.digistar.com/bzip2/#bzip2-latest](http://www.digistar.com/bzip2/#bzip2-latest)
[http://www.wavpack.com](http://www.wavpack.com)

I tried to implement the BZIP2-compression library as I did with ZLIB, but I can't compile the C-sources properly, because the programmers added some nasty queries and data structures which don't make it run in 16Bit - even if it were possible to realize. In contrast to ZLIB this library wastes a lot of memory for nothing, too. If you look for a suitable file compressor, don't use BZIP2.

I can't catch why no C-compiler is able handling 32Bit-values properly in 16Bit-mode, let alone using 32Bit-registers, even if all such called "Pentium-Optimizations" are switched on. The executable code will become an orgy of loading integers from one location to another, only to throw the values away finally. That's stupid. Therefore I hate C and will stay with Assembler. Here I don't have such a silly restrictable behaviour.

Hmm... Is it bad that whenever I see the name of your program, I have to stop and think that it's probably pronounced gob-read instead of go-bread?

Added: Hellforces (good Russian first-person-horror-shooter; 2005)
Nothing to say about this simple container format. But all file entries have a trailing "z" which are properly removed by GOBREAD.

Added: Hostile Waters (futuristic U-Boat-game; 2001)
Simple format.

Added: Command and Conquer - Renegade (2002)
Another simple format. Extraction is also supported by the "GAUP"-plugin for TotalCmd.

Changed:
- Help text changed
- ZLIB-library source code modified to reduce code space (1KB less in 16Bit-mode, 2KB less in 32Bit-mode).

This tool reminds me of my command line tool MultiEx from 1997.

@Mr.Mouse:
So what?
Do you want a gaudy MultiMegaByte installation application for stupid mouse clickers or do you want simply unpack game files? No problem, I can upload eight 100MB files on rapidshare, in case you want to have something to busy with. But the result will be the same somehow.
What's wrong with the interface? Are you not able to use your keyboard properly? OK, it is inappropriate for people who play games at a console with their two thumbs.
Despite the age of the module skeleton (as I mentioned first I am updating and optimizing it since 1996) this program is able to handle more file formats easier than any awkward and resource-eating .NET or JAVA junk.
Each module costs about 50...200 Bytes in real executable code size, depending on the complexity. If I want to reach the 64KByte file size barrier I would still have to add 150 to 200 formats...

I would advise you to keep that tone in check. 

I merely said it reminds me of my own first multi format extractor, MultiEx. 

I did not say anything about which approach is best, nor do I feel any need to do so, as that is really not worth it. If you feel the need to express frustration with 'stupid-mouse clickers', or have to slam .NET and JAVA 'junk', go ahead and afterwards feel good about yourself, but leave us out of it. 

You have a nifty little program there, I'm sure we all appreciate.

Added: Space Siege, SSG*-files.
Genre: Role-playing, Action


This is a very tricky file format similar to Dungeon Siege (and Supreme Commander?). I have no idea why the programmers of this game made it that complicated. Without using this text ([http://www.watto.org/extract/program/archives.txt](http://www.watto.org/extract/program/archives.txt)) as a help I wouldn't have found out what structure this file format has. The description there is very incomplete so I had to investigate a lot by myself.
Mainly there are two tables, one for the files and one for the directories. Both of them contain dependency information and additional chunk tables if a file is compressed.
First I tried to descend the directory structure but then I decided to loop through the file table and ascend the directory table for each file. This simplified the extraction algorithm.
After intensive testing I assume GOBREAD will unpack all files properly.

Added: Das schwarze Auge: Drakensang (The Dark Eye: Drakensang), NPK-files
Genre: Classic Role-playing, 3D-Action

This game appears to be an expanded version of an old one from the early ninetees which ran under DOS. I remember that it could be purchased as a cheap budget title at that time (it cost about 3 Deutsch-Mark). It seems the programmers try to brush up an old idea with new graphics.

The NPK file format doesn't use compression. The file structure consists of relative directory and file entries which have to be put together.
Each entry has variable length and starts with a DWORD-flag:
"DIR_" - directory entry, descending the path
"FILE" - file entry
"DEND" - directory entry, ascending the path
"DATA" - start of data area

Because there is no information about the number of files I continue the extraction process until the substraction of [size_of_extracted_file] from [remaining_size_of_data_area] returns zero.

Added:	Dreamstripper, CBN-files
Genre:	Adult

The format is mentioned in this topic:
[viewtopic.php?f=10&t=3107](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=3107)

Bugfixed (Sep 03, 2008):

- Module Drakensang:
	Unpacker stopped with an error message if some existing files couldn't be overwritten
- General
Extraction process cancellation with "ESC"-key:
	It was polled between every buffer writes which resulted in improperly cutted files.
	Now it is polled only when a file is about to be created.

Changed: (Sep 07, 2008):

- Module Genetroopers:
	Removed from automatic detection because the format can't be reliably recognized.

Hey thanks for trying to support cbn files in your program but I cant seem to run it. I click on it but all it does is just show a bunch of words in an msdos prompt window that blaze by at the speed of light in less then 2 seconds and it disappears or closes out. I also tried draging the files onto the exe and still nothing. Is the problem that it isnt vista compatible?

This is a such called "console" or "command line" program. You have to be familiar with the console window of windows and you have to use your keyboard. 
I couldn't test it on Vista yet but it should run fine in all versions of Win up to XP.
In XP you can open a console window with:

```
cmd
```

For example, if you wish to save the "light speed blazing" output text to an everlasting file named "help.txt" you would have to type (assuming GOBREAD.EXE is being located in your path/directory/folder, whatever you call it):

```
gobread >help.txt
```

To extract files from Dreamstripper CBN-files into the current path/directory/folder you have to type (assuming "filename" is the name of one of the CBN-files):

```
gobread /cbn filename.cbn
```

If you encounter further problems using the Windows-console, I recommend to RTFM of Windows.

Improved: PKR file format handling

The PKR container is used in some games (XMEN2, Spiderman, ProSkater BMX and maybe other).
Obviously the length of the name space in an entry differs for each game (XMEN2 uses 80h Bytes, ProBMX uses 20h).
Because there is no mark (like a version information) in these files which indicates this difference I implemented an algorithm to calculate the required table size. This should allow unpacking of many derivates of this file type.

Added: HPK, ZLIB-compressed container ("Glory of the Roman Empire")

Format of the file:
<HPK_ZLIB><OFS_TABLE><ZLIB_DATA>

Format description (ASM-pseudo syntax):

```
	HPK_MARK	DWORD	"ZLIB"		;Marker
	HPK_USIZE	DWORD	?		;Uncompressed size of destination file
	HPK_CSIZE	DWORD	?		;Maximum size of uncompressed chunk
ENDS
HPK_ZLIB	ENDS

OFS_TABLE	...DWORDs	?		;Start of ZLIB-compressed chunk

ZLIB_DATA	db ? BYTE (?)		;ZLIB-Chunks
```

There is no END-marker nor number-of-files value. The "END"-condition must be determined by HPK_USIZE.

@gamemaster:
I'm afraid I won't help you. If I would, I would be paid for working at a support center.
As I wrote before: There is no "clicking" support.
Please be conformed to your operating system first and only then post anything regarding to problems using my program.
For common abbreviations JFGI.
By the way, don't expect to see any "spectacular" whithin the DreamStripper-CBN-files.

I figured out what rtfm is. Its read the f@!#$ing manual. Duh! I feel like an idiot know. Oh and the only reason I want to extract the files is to see if I can get the models to use for things like mods for games and such.

Gamemaster, let me help you out a bit. 

I've written a simple graphical user interface for people who do wish to be able to click on a button to make GoBread go and extract the stuff from archives it supports. 

It's an early version and will only go for the formats that it automatically detects (I couldn't be bothered to add support for non-auto formats, I just wrote it as a quick-fix, it also does not let you create certain archives from file in a folder). 

The GUI is called GoBakery. It's attached with a version of gobread.exe. To update it, just take a new version of gobread and copy that to the folder you unzipped GoBakery in.

Please note that gobread does not support long filenames, does not let you extract to a specific folder, cannot list contents of an archive and cannot update an archive. The "use at your own risk" statement in asmxtx's help text so naturally also applies to GoBakery.

I think this should satisfy people who are more familiar with a GUI or have no experience with command line tools. Though I suggest to some that they do. Some pretty awesome programs are command line driven.  I find it easier and more to the point in some cases. Anyways, I like your GUI Mr.Mouse, it looks well understandable and to the point.

Anyways, should ease the lives of those having trouble with operating GoBread. 

P.S. Interesting choice title. GoBakery. XD I get the joke.

"Stolen" is a file format which can't be detected automatically.
You MUST specify the file format.
To extract Stolen's BCB-files, enter:
GOBREAD /stolen <file_name>

Please refer to the help text which GOBREAD prints/creates.

Added extraction support for some quick-and-easy-formats, just for fun.
All formats are kind of <number_of_files>-<table:offs,length,name>-<data>. Not worth discussing it.
Game info links are below.

Flesh Feast, MUF-files (1997)
[http://www.mobygames.com/game/windows/flesh-feast](http://www.mobygames.com/game/windows/flesh-feast)

Messiah, DTA(+IDX)-files (2001)
[http://www.mobygames.com/game/windows/messiah](http://www.mobygames.com/game/windows/messiah)

Outwars, FF-files (1998)
[http://www.mobygames.com/game/windows/outwars](http://www.mobygames.com/game/windows/outwars)

Panzer Elite Action, X-files (2006/2007)
[http://www.mobygames.com/game/windows/p ... s-of-glory](http://www.mobygames.com/game/windows/panzer-elite-action-fields-of-glory)
[http://www.mobygames.com/game/windows/dunes-of-war](http://www.mobygames.com/game/windows/dunes-of-war)


Also I made some small changes in the help text to get it more comprehensible (hopefully).

Added partial extraction support for Curse: The Eye Of Isis (2003), file GAME.AE
[http://pc.ign.com/objects/017/017409.html](http://pc.ign.com/objects/017/017409.html)

Added extraction support for "Wintermute Engine"-games, DCP-files (by request)
This format uses XOR-encryption to hide the file names.
Notes:
It was slightly difficult to find out what the XOR-encryption value for the file names is by "scanning" the EXE. After I found it the remains were an easy task.
The file has a known <name-size-offset> structure.

Format description:

```
00 02 00 00		;Version, if < 200h, then no XOR-filename-encryption is used
;here some useless commentaries up to offset 7fh

Offset 80h:
DWORD		;Offset file table

<Offset file table>:
BYTE length(descr)	;Length of (useless) DCP-file description string
 BYTEs descr		;String, variable length of length(descr) incl. 0
BYTE	0		;terminator

DWORD			;Number of files

File table entries:

BYTE	;Length file name
 BYTEs ?	;File name; XOR-encrypted if version=200h; XOR-Value=44h
DWORD	;Offset file
DWORD	;Uncompressed data length
DWORD	;Comressed data length (0, if uncompressed); compression=ZLIB
DWORD	0
DWORD	CRC(?)	;Only present if version =200h
DWORD	0	;Only present if version =200h
```

This time it is not an unpacker update but a total rework of the help text system. I personally don't require such a functionality, but I don't know all areas of application which someone other would have.
The general help text is shortened for more clearness.
Two switches are added: "INFO" and "LIST".

For example,
this prints the recognized file format of the file "filename.dat":

```
GOBREAD /info filename.dat
```

this prints out a list of all supported formats (option + flags + description):

```
GOBREAD /list
```


Furthermore I recompiled the ZLIB-library from "CDECL"- to "STDCALL"-conventions after a long time of madding with "#pragma"-directives from WATCOM-C. I like "STDCALL" more because it produces smaller code and is more convenient to handle by assembly language which I'm programming in.

- Post Title: Re: Little extractor program

Most of the games will run with the extracted files if they are placed in the right folder. Therefore it is not necessary to recompile/rebuild the container files. Some games require ALL containers to be extracted.

Use FILEMON or PROCMON to get information about the files a game accesses.

Most of the games try to access the uncompressed files first and if and only if they don't exist they try to open the container files.
If you plan to create a modification for a game just extract all files, change those files which you want to modificate and delete all other ones which have been unchanged.

If you want to provide some files for evaluation please use NETLOAD.IN.

I want to find text and translate it.
But I am not sure if is it possible with your program, maybe this is not archive, but compiled files?
Could you, please, try to extract these files (texts)?

Thank you very much...

Here is another quick-and-easy-update.

Added: Requital, RES-files
Game-Info: [http://www.mobygames.com/game/windows/requital](http://www.mobygames.com/game/windows/requital)

Added: Nikopol, OPK-files (by request)
Because I had only one file which "shaneno" provided I don't know if the file recognition algorithm works flawlessly. Please post here if you encounter any malfunctions.


Both file formats are very easy to handle (NumOfFiles/LenData/OffsData stuff) and don't seem to use any compression methods.

At this time I have some trouble at home so please be patient if I can't answer immediatly.

EDIT
Bugfix: In the version from Oct 30, 2008 the /INFO-switch for Nikopol didn't work. If you attach importance to it, delete this version and download the new attached one.

Very thanks! It can extract all .opk file perfectally.
And can you add a repack option for .opk file?I want to translate the game ,so i need to replace a font file in a .opk file, because the new font file's size is diferent from the origin one,the offset in file head need be rewrite.So i need you help. Thanks again.

And i have another question about Wintermute Games' DCP-files.
If the script has been compiled ,do u have a way to get the origin .script ? Because if the subtitle text is in the compiled .script file ,it is hard to translate it. So i want to get the origin one.

There are at least two problems:
Firstly the file structure has to be maintained. This requires recursive file parsing of subdirectories. GOBREAD does not have such an algorithm implemented yet.
Secondly the table whithin OPK-files contains some fields which might represent CRC values the game could verify during file accesses. It was too much effort to work out the algorithm for the calculation.
Just try if the game still works with extracted files (see this note some posts before: [viewtopic.php?p=26900#p26900](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?p=26900#p26900)).

Added: Adventure Game Studio files, .VOX/.EXE (maybe other file extensions too)

This is a very nasty format. I'm fed up with that. It contains sub-formats with slightly different structures which requires a lot of branching. There are many tables, some of them with unnecessary content. The filename table is "encrypted" with different values depending on the sub-format and filled up with garbage to fool examiners. But I think I could manage it.

- [http://www.bigbluecup.com/games.php?act ... il&id=1067](http://www.bigbluecup.com/games.php?action=detail&id=1067)
Could you please repair (add support for) it?

But it is great piece of work and I thank you very much!

So, I tried some other games and it works fine!

There are only 2 problems:
1) Sometimes (for example this game - [http://www.maniac-mansion-mania.com/ind ... load&gid=5](http://www.maniac-mansion-mania.com/index.php?option=com_docman&task=doc_download&gid=5)) there is not only .EXE file, but resources were split into other file .001. But this file I can not unpack with your extractor. Could you, please, add support for it?
2) As I wrote above with examples, new version of Adventure Game Studio was main upgrade and no game created with version 3.x can be unpacked. But, maybe this will not be so hard task, but only small change?

Thank you for your help once again.

To "neoen": Don't you think you are expecting too much?
I am a private programmer only who does file format invastigations just for fun and mental sporty reasons in its spare time. I reluctantly examine files from games which I am not interested in.
If you need to extract some special file formats: I could do it, but I think about to get paid for it.

AGS was a very hard task, but you did it.
Could you, please, add support for new version of AGS and special files .00X to complete it?
I think that it should not be so hard when you examined the way of packing similar files.

Ad other request (TellTale):
I am doing translations also for fun and not for money so I can not pay for it much.
But in case of TellTale games I heard that it is very hard task, and my friends tried many people to get text from game, so I think that they would be OK to pay for it. Please look at files and PM how much it would be in this case.

Thank you for your help...

AGS divides its main container into at least five sub-formats.
GOBREAD currently supports only the following single-volume formats with these indentification numbers (hex): 06, 0A, 0B, 0F.

If you use GOBREAD with existing (multi-volume) *.00?-files only the files from the first volume will be extracted properly. All others will contain garbage. I have no workaround for this case yet.

AGS has added a new format with number 14h and changed header sizes and data structures. This requires a lot of examining.

I will do my best, but it takes some time...

Edit(Nov 11, 2008)
Now all the subformats mentioned above should be fully supported, including multi volumes - except subformat 14h. I have to work at it some more.

Updated: Adventure Game Studio files

After some intensive work I think I am able to unextract all current sub-formats of AGS.
The newer sub-format 14h (AGS ver. 3.x) has file tables with variable lengths whose values are stored in a crippled way, whereas the older formats use predefined entry-lengths.
All games I checked unpacked successfully. I couldn't find multi-volume-files for sub-format 14h yet, but they should extract properly, too.

Hello,
I saw, that your program supports *.wrs files (Bagger Simulator).

I have also *.wrs files, but in 3D Driving School and I want to unpack them. When I try it with your software, I get the filenames, but something is wrong, because I get error when I try open e.g. picture.

Here is an example wrs file:
[http://netload.in/dateiNzQ3ODY3OD/seg_c6.wrs.htm](http://netload.in/dateiNzQ3ODY3OD/seg_c6.wrs.htm)

Thanks for a try, mate!

@aluigi:
For me there are two problems to use this source:
1) The "C" language interpretes the size of "int" depending on the destination platform the source code will be compiled for. This is very annoying. But I need "hardcoded" DWORD (32-Bit) integer definitions.
2) Many of (de-)compression source codes I find (e.g. LZO, LZSS, APLIB) implement only a simple source-to-destination-buffer decompression of the whole data without support of partial buffering like ZLIB does. This becomes important when large files have to be processed.
Could you write a ZLIB-like "wrapper"-interface for LZSS (callback or repeated-calls-until...)

> keep in mind that this unlzss.h is under the GPL license
Yes, I think so... It is abstracted from 3D-Gamestudio ACKNEX.DLL.

- Post Title: Re: Little extractor program

in my unlzss.h there is no usage of int, I have used stdint.h which applies the correct size of a variable on any system in which is compiled.
so uint32_t generates a 32 bit variable anywhere stdint.h is supported.

for implementing the file-to-file mode it's enough to make a quick modification to the code using fgetc in UNLZSS_CGET and fputc in UNLZSS_CPUT and using FILE instead of in, out and their relative sizes.

I linked that code only as example of what worked here in my quick tests so that then you could do your tests and use a similar code which works better for your needs.

> Yes, I think so... It is abstracted from 3D-Gamestudio ACKNEX.DLL.uhmmm I don't have understood this.

asmxtx:

    Could you add a support for this game .vbf  files? 
    The game's name is Chronicles of Mystery - The Scorpio Ritual.
    You could download a sample file from here:
[http://netload.in/dateiMzE1MjQ2ND/datas.vbf.htm](http://netload.in/dateiMzE1MjQ2ND/datas.vbf.htm)

    Maybe it is a quick and easy format? Thanks.

Yes, it is.

- The programmers decided not to include original full file names, but created checksums or hash values for each file and stored them instead. Therefore the original file- and path- names are lost.

- Inside the VBF are some NMO/CMO-files (Marker: "Nemo Fi").They contain ZLIB-compressed and other data, stored in chunks. I don't know what to do with these files so I leave them untouched. Maybe a game editor handles them.

The GAUP plugin for TotalCommander supports this format, too.

Short file description:

```
dword "VXGB"	- Marker
dword ?		- size filetable

Filetable-entry:
db ? dup(?)	- file name, variable length, 0-terminated
dd ?		- Length of data
```

Your two files don't reveal much, but at a first glance it looks like a "quick and easy"-format. I need to investigate more files.
If you can, post links to a demo or something on an OCH where downloads can be done fast as a free user (no rapidshare, vipfile!)

Well, like I said, there's about 1,960 of the .pck files. So I would hope they'd be quick and easy lol.

Let me know of a good hosting site, and I can upload a few more for you. If you want I can put them into a .rar file or something if that would be better.

Bugfixes/Updates:

- One module caused the format recognition process to end prematurely if EXE file with some special header-data constallations were given.

- Now the FS format extraction seems to work, finally. This format is used by many FPS-games wich use the "Havok"-engine ("Gene Troopers", "Chaser", the "History Channel" series and many others).
It took me a long time to discover the last "secret" about the strange zero-size of chunks in the chunk-tables.
Almost all files in such a container are compressed (not primarily for space reduction, but for data camouflage). For each compressed file in the FS-container there exists a separate chunk table, which again contains values for the length of each chunk. Much often these values are zero, and I wasn't sure how to handle them. Now I found out if such a value occurs, the corresponding chunk has a length of 4000h Bytes and has to be simply copied to the output.
Last but not least there was an error in the file-loop procedure.


@slackbabbath:

Sorry, but I have to disappoint you. Your files don't meet any structure of "classic" container files. Both the short file sizes and the large number of such files in your game makes me wonder. This might be rather a task for a data converter but not a file extractor - but if somebody knows some hints then he might let me know.

Added: LZSS-decompression algorithm.
This was necessary to support some formats, e.g. "Baggersimulator" (3D-Gamestudio) and others.

I had to write my own implementation because I couldn't find any library with a ZLIB-like interface. Unfortunately my algorithm is pretty slow, but works.

Hi, there is one more question to Wintermute .dcp files.
When I extract files from archive, there are many .script files. But these files are probably damaged or somehow compiled. Because when I look at original script files, I can read them in editor, but extracted script files not.
Without these files it is not possible to translate games, because of many strings in these files 
Thank you for your help...

How bout adding some HOME .SDAT Files? It's the PS3 Service newly released and it's servers are bad. I can link directly to the files it uses, it's that bad.
scee-home.playstation.net/c.home/prod/live/Objects/AD3FB153-328647C4-A6B962CB-EF41ACF7/object.sdat
scee-home.playstation.net/c.home/prod/live/Objects/41C2F23E-8E704EA1-99FD02BF-73A256F6/object.sdat

The first one is a file for the PACMAN Arcade Machine, it's the title and info of the item that shows in HOME.
The second one is the PACMAN Arcade Machine's Java Script(it contains how the game is supposed to load and stuff)

I can link you to a ton more if you want, there are Also ODC files, which I'm not sure which they contain, but they are not for Pacman.

@mambox:

You have provided a link to a commercial copy-protection site. I have stated in USAGE.TXT that I don't support any copy-protection removal!
TRYMEDIA is an online copy protection system which encrypts essential files of the game. They can't be recovered without payment.
I don't want investigate such stuff!
Never provide any links to TRYMEDIA or similar sites again!

@CakeIsALie:

For me it is difficult to examine files different from the PC-system. Unfortunatly the files you have linked to seem to be heavily encrypted. Because I am fixed to the PC I would prefer  a PC-version of this game.

for activemark encrypted files the only tool which seems to make the job is ActiveMark Decrypt:
[http://xchg.info/ARTeam/Tutorials/ARTeam_Releases/](http://xchg.info/ARTeam/Tutorials/ARTeam_Releases/)
but this is not valid in your case because this VNZ/batch file is not an AM one (in fact lacks of the classical signature of this type of file) and doesn't seem a "common" known file format.

I hate the christmas time because all people pretend to be adjuvant. There are either very old movies or lot of pathetical singing on TV. And the sky is grey and dark.
I will take the remaining days of this year to get a ride on a Ferris wheel, a roller coaster and a swing until I puke, because Berlin has driven havy ordnance to its Christmas fairs.
Happy New Year!

Added: Extraction support for Nancy Drew

This is based on this post:

[http://aluigi.freeforums.org/help-with- ... -t716.html](http://aluigi.freeforums.org/help-with-autotext-cif-in-lzss-compressed-t716.html)

bugtest wrote a fine utility for testing the modified LZSS-(de-)compression. Without it I wouldn't never have found out this algorithm.

There is a "simple" encryption: The byte position is substracted from the bytecontent at the current position.

I am not sure if there is some directory structure or file type description.
Some data entries have zero length.

You have to evaluate the extracted files to find the proper file type (there are a lot of TGA-graphics, for example).

(1)At first .very thanks to asmxtx  and bugtest!

(2)And then i also a few information to asmxtx  and others.
In Nancy Drew 16,17,the pic file format is like some raw bmp file.
It looks likes this :

file head (18bytes)
24bit rgb raw data
Last line --->First line

and i have converted a pic to bmp by add a 54bytes bmp head with hand

(3)I have a question.
    How to convert cif file to TGA picture?
    Just change the file extend name or need add a file head?
    Gobread can extract Nancy Drew 1-19 all ?
    Can you add a to bmp option for nancy drew 16,17?

It seems the picture format is TGA with transparency information.
Simply use your favorite image processing software or a picture browser to handle this format.

> How to convert cif file to TGA picture?
A CIF-file might be a container file. Extract it with "GOBREAD filename.cif".

> Gobread can extract Nancy Drew 1-19 all ?
It is tested with ND-17 only. ND-18 uses a different file format.

> Can you add a to bmp option for nancy drew 16,17?
Sorry, no.

@stevenx

In general, once an extraction module works flawlessly, I will have deleted the game, shelved my source code and forgotten it.

I would not recommend to change filenames in a container file: The game might not gain access to predefined ressources.
I would recommend to leave the original file structure and add the edited files only.

Try if the game works with the extracted files and the not available container file (for safety rename it instead of deleting).
If so, just recover the original game, extract all files from the container into the right game directory, delete all files which you don't want to change, edit your file(s) and see if the game reflects your changes. (look for FILEMON/REGMON/PROCMON in this thread)

If this not works, you would have to program a DCP-repacker for all the extracted game files.

Here is my file declaration:

```
DE AD C0 DE JUNK
00 02 00 00	Version, if <> 200h, then no XOR-encryption of filename


Table:

db len,description(len-1)
db 0
dword	number_of_files

byte	length name
bytes	Name, (xor-value: 44h, only if Version 200h)
dword	Offset data
dword	uncompressed length of data
dword	compressed length of data (or 0, if not compressed)
dword	0
dword	CRC(?)	;only if Version 200h
dword	0	;only if Version 200h

```

For your appeasement, I am currently working on an extractor for the remaining Nancy-Drew-container-versions (01...18).
But it will take some time...

@asmxtx

  At first ,very thanks for your hard work!

  I will tell you why i want to change file name in .dcp file.
  I have a WME adventure game made in german language,it can't be started at chinese windows XP. When the game access some german filename files ,it had exceptions. So,i
want to chang the german filename files into english filename.

  Here is my plan A:
1. XOR .dcp with 44h ,so i can see and find the german filename 
2.chang it into english filename 
3.find the location which CALL FROM of german filename and chang it into english filename too.
   (Maybe in .exe or other files)
4.After done these,i think it will well run in chinese windows XP without any setting.

  Here is my plan B:
1.find the location which CALL FROM of german filename and chang it into english filename .
   (Maybe in .exe or other files)
2.extract them from .dcp and put them in the same folder with changed english name .
3.After done these,i think it will well run in chinese windows XP without any setting.

I don't know which will be success before test.

@stevenx

It would not be the best to XOR the DCP-header.
As a very lazy man I would do the following:
- Extract all container files to somewhere.
- Create a list file of all extracted files like this:

```
dir /b /s >FILELIST.TXT
```

- In this text file search for the target with a text editor. If you found a suspicious one, do a full-text-search in all extracted files in ASCII- and UNICODE-mode.
- If possible, replace the wrong name with an appropriate one in the found file(s).
- Rename the suspicious file to the new name.
- Add these changed files to the game directory keeping the directory structure intact.

---

I am about to finish my work on these annoying Nancy-Drew-files. Most of the content is stored as RAW data.
There are at least three data types in a "TREE"-file:

```
02 - Picture data, sometimes stored as TGA, sometimes as RAW, with or without transparency
03 - Some kind of data I can't recognize

```


A "FILE"-file can contain another series of nested "FILE"-files. Therefore extracted files have to be extracted again.

   Thanks again,my friend.
   I have use a way like yours to make the game run in my chinese windows XP.
   And waiting yours ND extractor now...
   And also a question,you said some game will first find if the same file exists out of the continer file.  I made a test ,ND18,19 worked with the OUT files.But ND 16,17 does not worked.I have use filemon to checked,it read  autotext.cif ... first. I won't to make a packer ,so i wnat to made it works.Can you give a little advice?Maybe it need add a head to the OUT file? I means autotext.cif and so on. I just want to translate it.

Nancy-Drew-files is a proprietary file format (like Tomb-Raider BIG-files).
That means the programmers not simply chose to store original files into their containers (like in Wintermute, Quake, StarshipTroopers or other gory shooters), but they decided to remove irrelevant headers and informations from the original files and store only raw data with encryption+compression into their containers. It seems that this game won't run with original files in any case. Therefore it is immanent to know (or to guess) what type of data has been extracted.
Once a container is extracted, the obtained files might have to be converted to a generic format for further processing with an editor.
After editing (if possible) it is necessary to recompile these files to Nancy-Drew-raw-format and to put these files into a container.
Because I am not able to decrypt all fields in a container-table-entry I am not able to write a container-file-rebuilder - and I must admit I don't want to do that.
Maybe you could find a (commercial?) editor on the net, similar to Quake or something...

Added: Full extraction support for Monolith Games, ARCH??-files
Updated: F.E.A.R. 2: Project Origin, BNDL-/LVBNDL-files

Game info:
[http://www.mobygames.com/game/windows/f ... ect-origin](http://www.mobygames.com/game/windows/fear-2-project-origin)


I had to add the ARCH??-fileformat because GAUP (and maybe other unpackers) aren't able to recognize compressed data within the ARCH-files.
It was expecting to much to decompress such an amount of extracted files piece by piece.

There is no creation support for ARCHxx-files.

GOBREAD crashes (!!!) in case of one file. Use another extractor this case.

Added extraction support for "7.62: High Calibre", AZP-files
Game-info: [http://pc.ign.com/objects/142/14272762.html](http://pc.ign.com/objects/142/14272762.html)

To extract these files a processor with SSE2-instruction set is required.

The filenametable is encrypted with a kind of sophisticated MULTIPLY-/MODULO-algorithm.
After the table has been decrypted the good old filename/offset/length structure is exposed.
All data seem to be ZLIB-compressed. There are lot of zero-length and duplicate files within these containers.

If you talk about textures why you upload WAD files with ps2 adpcm stream? 
And the other games? -no comment?

Anyway i dont think you will get an extarctor for Wad files generally.
If you want only textures then use a simple format scanner, the files are uncompressed.

Because they aren't redable on 3D max or any other 3D-model program. I need them atleast in .tga like from any other normal game.
Also, GoW only use WAD files for compressing their textures.

It's true that Persianrug can decompress the bin files from the PoP-series, but it doesn't work on Beyond Good and Evil. 'sides, the tool needs alot of improvement since you can't rip many models comepletly out for example the Farrah-textures.

Added extraction support for "Angels vs. Devils", DAT-files
Game-info: [http://www.mobygames.com/game/windows/angels-vs-devils](http://www.mobygames.com/game/windows/angels-vs-devils)

This one has got a simple old-school file structure: offset/length/name, no compression. Not worth to loose a word about it.

Updated: Adventure Game Studio (AGS/AGD), EXE & Multivolume-files
(tested on Kings Quest 2)

To make analyzing harder they have updated their encryption algorithm using random numbers with initialization values stored within the file. In contrast to previous versions where only the filenames were encrypted, the whole file information table is encrypted now in one piece.

Further changes:
- Nancy-Drew: Improved speed during extraction of encrypted+compressed files.
- ZLIB: Some assembler optimizations.
- Extended umlaut-table. Some game developers use foreign character sets within file tables. Such names weren't converted correctly. This could have made files undeletable by GUI-based applications.
- Changed switch "/INFO" to "/CHECK" which reflects its purpose more, I think.
- Updated USAGE.TXT

Some files within these containers seem to be stored as RAW-data, some as regular file. Some filetable entries contain information about the kind of the file. I plan to extend the filenames with this information ... somehow ...

I'm feeling very stupid at the moment  . I wanted to try modding 'Legend: Hand of God' today and I followed the Gobread instructions very carefully, but I just can't seem to make it work.

Anyway, I thought I'd start simply by unpacking the script files. There are two files, one called Script.pak and the other called Script.pak.dat.



So I copied the two script files from the Legend Data folder to a folder named Unpack (just to be safe, because I didn't want to accidently mess up the original files).

But whenever I try to extract the files this is the message I get:



Does anybody know what I'm doing wrong?

Thanks muchly.

Yes ... I know the problem.
In case of "Nancy Drew"-formats you must not use the "/CBN"-switch, because this one is reserved for another (adult) game: "DreamStripper".

The game series "Nancy Drew" has a lot of different format derivatives. (I far as I know there are at least TWENTY(!) games of this series).
The developers changed the file format within every new game-version. Therefore it is difficult to develop an algorithm which recognizes all appropriate file formats.

I'm still working on this format, but please give me some time.

In the moment, try "/NANCY" instead of "/CBN"

Added extraction support for:
- Lights of Altair
- Nocturne
- Painkiller
- Star Trek - Hidden Evil
- Haemimont Games, HPK-files (Imperium Romanum, Grand Ages of Rome...)
- some other ones (see /LIST-switch)

Further changes:
- Some optimizations and preparations for a more convenient way to handle strings
- "VIEW"-switch (bugfixed): Now you can take a look into a file before extracting, for example:

```

```

This will show all offsets and (compressed) lengths as hexadecimal values.

Or:

```

```

This will show all offsets and (compressed) lengths as decimal values.

-------

The HPK-format gave me a real headache. It took some different approaches to develop a working extraction algorithm.
The file-/directory-table is stored with minimum information as a tree-/chained-list-structure.
The tree must be descended/ascended and the name-pieces must be completed in the right way.
There is no information about the total number of files.
An HPK-file can contain other HPK-files with the same structure or ZLIB-chunkwise-compressed files.
There is another compression method used too, named "LZIS". I haven't been able to handle this yet.

General HPK-file structure:

```
DWORD Index to the following offset-table-entry
DWORD Flag if it is a file or directory entry
WORD  Length of following name
BYTEs Name

Offset table:
DWORD Offset to data (if file entry) or to the next entry (if directory entry)
DWORD Size of data or size of the following directory entry

```

Hey mate, I've used your tool a couple of times now and have found it does it's job well indeed. 
You can't really turn a corner in recent times without running into a 'game extractor' which is just a very generic rip-off of some other tool. Indeed; all of these extractors that support all of the same games and nothing new. Rarely does a tool (and a tool's programmer) go out of it's way to generate and implement support for knowingly unsupported archives/resources. 
You fall into the more admirable minority as it would seem. Soo thanks.

I do my best to let it run flawlessly because I don't want to have any complaints.

> You can't really turn a corner in recent times without running into a 'game extractor' which is just a very generic rip-off of some other tool.
Yes, it is a "ripper" in general. My main goal simply was to create a small program with a lot of algorithms (an "AIO" - All-In-One) and without much trouble using it.

> Indeed; all of these extractors that support all of the same games and nothing new.
If you expect the newest file formats to be decoded within the shortest time after their releases then I must admit I am a slow old dinosaur. But in contrast to the developers who need weeks or months to develop an encryption algorithm I am fast enough. You might consider that I am not interested in every "new" game and that I am not inclined to be bothered with all the newest stuff.

> Rarely does a tool (and a tool's programmer) go out of it's way to generate and implement support for knowingly unsupported archives/resources.
Most of the games/programs work without such container files. If not, it would be necessary to write a relatively complex algorithm for creating such container files. Mainly I am not interested in doing that.

> You fall into the more admirable minority as it would seem.
I am not a professional programmer. I don't get any money for this program, I'm not a slave. I do this only for fun.
If you think this program might useful to you, you can use it the way you want. If you are not satisfied with it, don't download it again.
But if you think you can accelerate any reversing or development processes, contribute to XENTAX and let's know how to become better!

How to take I know, it becomes so:
c:\test\GOBREAD.exe c:\testunpack\data.pkr

I know as to pack, but for some reason it is impossible to me, I make here so:
c:\test\GOBREAD.exe -create=data.pkr /PKR

Help please, it is very necessary to pack files from this game!
I hope that you help!)))

You are aware that this is an unpacker, right?

And what for to make extractor if then not probably to pack back files?

Who can will prompt, whether is packer back in.pkr a format?

Sorry, that I didn't answered your request the last time because I am currently enjoying the nice summer days to get the head free of evil things.

@AlexTrin ([viewtopic.php?p=30591#p30591](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?p=30591#p30591), [viewtopic.php?p=30602#p30602](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?p=30602#p30602)):

There is an older version of "X2 Wolverine" with almost the same name of the newest 2008/2009er version. At this time I'm not able to extract this new version.

As I stated some times ago, in many cases it is not necessary to recreate extracted container files. You only need to place modified files to the right place.
Therefore I have left the idea of recreating container files generally.

Please remember: I have written this program because I want to know what data is stored on a hard disk.
If you want to modify some data - you have to be on your own.

@vizipok ([viewtopic.php?p=30298#p30298](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?p=30298#p30298)):
The game series "Settlers" use a very havy encryption method.
I think if you roam through XENTAX you will be able to find a solution.
If you were able to find something, let me know.

Am I doing this right? What I do is make a new folder,put GOBREAD.EXE inisde it,copy the file I want extracted and past it in the same folder, then I take the file and drag it on top of GOBREAD.EXE.Nothing happens! All that does is a blank cmdpromt window pops up for half a second than disappears.I tried it with different files just to make sure and the same thing happens.If im not doing it right how am I supposed to?

No, you do not drag and drop. This is a command line tool. Open up a command prompt, type the name of the program for help and go on from there.

Thats not what I mean. The folder where I have both the file I want to extract and GOBRREAD.EXE is K:\gbred I typed in K:\gbred\GOBREAD.EXE in cmdpromt and got the program started.The file I want to extract is data.pak.What do I type in order to extract it?

Anyone?

Well, if you got it started, then you should have received this:

```

Syntax: GOBREAD [{/|-}switch] [containerfile] [{/|-}switch] [>output.log]
  or    GOBREAD {/|-}create{=|:}containerfile {/|-}switch  [>output.log]

Switches:
 LIST   Lists supported formats and their switches
 CHECK  Test if the format can be handled
 CREATE Create container file (not fully supported; format switch reqd.)
 VIEW[{=|:}D] List files with method, offsets, sizes and names;
        D = decimal, default: hex


Examples:
 GOBREAD DATA.PAK       = Extracts all files from DATA.PAK
                          if the format can be detected
 GOBREAD /check FILE.DAT= Shows which format would be used
 GOBREAD DARK.COB -DF   = Extracts all files from DARK.COB
                          forcing format "Dark Forces"
 GOBREAD /cbn file.cbn  = Same as above, but with other format
 GOBREAD -CREATE=REDNECK.GRP /GRP
                        = Creates the containerfile "REDNECK.GRP"
                          from all files in the current directory
                          of type "GRP-Files"
 GOBREAD -view=d data.pak Lists all files in the container with dec numbers

This program is freeware. Use it at your own risk. Only for private use.
```

From this you should be able to figure out everything you need.

that means the exe is not in the same path as the directory you are in the command prompt.
you need to do like cd c:\GOBREAD
then type GOBREAD.exe c:\data.pak
just change out the locations for where you have them.

@Csimbi/@chrrox: Thank you that you got the point.
And thank you that you are able to cope with my program.

I have created GOBREAD more than ten years ago as a 16-Bit-DOS-program when I was a youngster in PC-assembler-programming.
Nowadays I wouldn't go up to a program in a way like this.
But the skeleton of GOBREAD includes all mechanisms to handle lot of file derivatives - and even with the usage of the newest 32Bit-processors instruction set - so I am bound to its scaffold.
It would cost it a lot work to convert it to a more modern script-like interpreter.
But if you think it helps you in any kind I would be grateful.

Adding scripting support would be beneficial for people who have experience with reversing file formats. On the other hand, any user can invoke a hard-coded functionality with a few parameters. I am quite happy with the tool as it is - it gets the job done without much hassle. I have the feeling that a lot of people think alike.

I would personally find scripting capability useful (especially if it would remain a command-line tool), especially when one's trying to reverse a new format. But. Since adding such capabilities is going to be a tremendous task, I will not make a statement saying: go for it.
Why not start from scratch behind the scenes and do it according to your own pace - without pressure from the community? This way, you can even drop the ball when you don't feel like doing it anymore.
Another alternative is making it an open-source project so those interested could contribute - though you might eventually end up without help, or, the other extreme: spend too much time on verifying code to be checked in.
Think it through, there is no rush.

Hi, I successfully extracted Chronicles of Mystery datal.vbf archive with Gobread ([viewtopic.php?p=27415#p27415](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?p=27415#p27415)), but I could not repack it. Is it possible? Thank you very much...

Added: Extraction support for Wolfenstein 2.

Warning:
- The "/VIEW"-switch doesn't work for this format.
- Many files don't get their proper file extensions (because I don't know them).
  They are replaced by the magic value from the main container and enclosed in exclamation marks. Examining the PK4-files doesn't give more information than I've already got.
  For example: MP3-sounds are named to "ambience.!!!SNDS!!!"
Could anybody give me a hint?


Notes:
The main container (SPK/MPK) consists of concatenated ZLIB-compressed chunks.
Each chunk is preceded by a magic value (which determines the data type) and two values for uncompressed and compressed size. A chunk extracts to another container with the final data and (rather simple) structure: Number_of_files + table_filenames_lengths + data (no offsets).

Therefore the extraction process is separated into two steps:
- Decompressing each ZLIB-chunk to a temporary file
- Extracting the data from this file

[Edit:
Please report if you encounter an "File format not recognized" (or anything else) error like Savage did:
[viewtopic.php?p=31405#p31405](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?p=31405#p31405)
This allows me to update the program.
Thanks.

According to this file structure the game must be an awful memory spendthrift in my opinion because of the large buffers needed to decompress the data.

usually the chunk based archives must be handled like a compressed file system.
for example if the name table says that the file myfile.dat is located at offset 0x12345 and has a size of 80000 bytes you must extract it chunk-by-chunk finding the starting chunk through the reading of the various chunks sizes (like an array) and continuing with this type of handling.

the memory consumed for the process will be only the one of a single chunk and those for keeping the array of "chunks sizes", so it's very good.

and the cool thing is that when you implement this process transparently you will only need to call your function instead of fread... and it works perfectly :)

Lo all, I have a little problem with wolfenstein files...
Here's what I did: I opened an spk file(ai_voice_ft_vo_english.spk) and extracted two files with offzip.
Now I have these two files 00000010.dat and 00000012.dat, and I tried to extract something from them with gobread (I type gobread 00000010.dat then enter) but gobread says "ERROR can't open file".
Now, I'm sure I'm doing or I did something wrong but I don't know what.
I think the problem is about the first extraction with offzip probably I'm not typing the right command line could someone help?
What are the right command line parameters to put in offzip when I extract?

Andrew

(I searched better and found GoBakery, everything works now thank u Mr.Mouse)

Very good that you spot it!
I do alot of verifications before extraction to have the original file structure intact. Therefore "unknown" magic values will be handled as "evil".
I might have overseen this file type but I appreciate if anybody reports this "misbehaviour".
I'll work on it.

It is not designed to run on 64-Bit-Systems.

I'm on a 32bit system, so I would not know, but I was under the impression that 64bit systems could run 32bit code.
I guess it's not the case then? Interesting. It would mean that you need to trash all your 32bit software that you purchased...

I'm an old assembler programmer and study processor specifications very intently.
So I found out that once an INTEL-based processor is initialized to run in 64Bit-mode (like Win-Vista64), the processor is not able to revert to 32-/16-bit-mode except by a hardware-reset and disables many features of 16-/32-Bit-instructions - like segment register usage and (unfortunately) some versatile instructions like "AAM". Such are treated as "Invalid Opcodes".
There is no possibility to execute any pure 16-/32-bit-code on a 64-bit-system straight ahead, as far as I know.
In 64-bit-mode one has to use an emulator program which interpretes this machine code and translates it in a processible form to the ruling 64-bit-OS.
Otherwise one has to install a 16-/32-bit-OS.

> It would mean that you need to trash all your 32bit software that you purchased...
It looks so. Or 64-bit-systems will go the same way like the Intel-686-processor: to a blind alley.

That would mean that older games do will nor run on Vista/Windows 7, though I have friends with Vista who said that the games work. There is no "XP Mode" on Vista, so I am not sure how that is possible then.

A 64Bit-processor has got many modes of operation:

Long mode #1:
"64Bit-mode" (can run 16- and 32-bit-PE-EXEs in "Compatibility-mode", but only in protected mode, not in virtual-8086 mode)

Long mode #2:
"Compatibility-mode" (can run any 16- and 32-bit-programs without recompilation)

It seems Win64 runs in "64Bit-mode", hence it isn't able to start any virtual-8086-mode software (like GOBREAD).

That means you can start any I386-PE-EXEs and maybe I286-NE-EXEs, but no MZ-EXE or COM.

Very confusing!

Hi, there's some problem with "goboarding" AGS games: old versions of Goboard extract 90% of files (without editor.dat and some rooms), and new versions can't extract anything, just creates 0 byte files.

For example, Larry 2 P&C
[http://www.bigbluecup.com/games.php?cat ... d&game=356](http://www.bigbluecup.com/games.php?category=100&action=search&sterm=leisure+suit+larry&action=download&game=356)

With some of old versions of Goboard I can extract main part of project, but without global script (editor.dat). But I can't extract any files with new version of Goboard!

So what's up with other games? 

Wanna extract some of them?:

- [Knight of Xentar (Dragon Knight 3)](http://www.old-games.ru/game/download/1652.html) (click red 2 words at right of table, type code, then click to red words at bottom "http...")
- [Star Trek: 25th Anniversary](http://www.old-games.ru/game/download/971.html) (same thing, first red words [Floppy-...], etc)

This shouldn't happen actually! Only 100% extration success should be accepted!
But this can happen because older GOBREAD versions don't know all variants of this format.
AGS is updating it very often and meanwhile there are tons of subformats which require a lot of branches in the extraction algorithm. I had even to implement some object oriented like programming method to master this situation.

> With some of old versions of Goboard I can extract main part of project, but without global script (editor.dat). But I can't extract any files with new version of Goboard!
Please excuse that I can't download any game from this company. But I will see if I can find a solution with your link.

Not really, sorry. That reminds me of these old times when 286AT's with chunky CGA/Hercules graphics were state of the art...

Hm, in fact AGS extracting works, I checked all Gobread versions.

But G. can't extract 'editor.dat' (main global script file of game) from exe. Seems it's main problem for open extracted project in AGS.

GOBREAD is a FREE PROGRAM - FREE OF CHARGE.
If anybody has any complaints about its functionality - IT's HIS PROBLEM!
At this time I am working on a re-packer program which allows users with programming experience to add their own extraction modules. So stay tuned...

uhmmm I have a doubt:
if the user needs experience with a programming language and the module is a pre-compiled binary dll (so a complete program without only the main function), isn't simpler for him to just write the tool from scratch as indeed he must do in any case?

I've been planning on doing something similar, but for the same reasons I have never actually started it - I could not come up with an easy framework.
Let's wait see what he's cooking - he might think up something different that makes things easier.

This are the features I'm about to implement -
(actually, these features WILL BE implemented, because a program of such a kind would not make any sense!):
- Full source subdirectory file scanning providing essential information, surpassing standard file searching routines
- Advanced command line evaluation for batch processing
- Dialogue windows with progress visualisation

All of these features rely on the development of libraries I've created many months ago.

For programmers:
Expect lot of functions to be called which return pointers to structures/functions which return pointers to other structures/functions which return pointers. If you ever have been programming in Windows you will know.

Here is a small update, mainly fixing some nasty bugs.
In my opinion the hell on earth for a programmer arises if he has to find a bug which is caused by overlooking the last byte in a buffer or by choosing the wrong of two comparison methods, for example a>(b-1) or a>=b.
Not even the most sophisticated super hitech compiler can be helpful in such a case...

------

Although it is an old game I added "Fallout" because it has an interesting file structure.
I looked at an incomplete format description from here:[http://www.watto.org/extract/program/archives.txt](http://www.watto.org/extract/program/archives.txt) and thought I should complete it.
The "/view" switch doesn't work for it, sorry. Some improvement should be in charge.

```

4 - Number of 8 byte blocks to allocate (internal only)
4 - Size of additional memory to allate (= 0)

I found some information on games made by the company tri-ace and was wondering if you could look at the format and see if it can be extracted.
I have included some sample files.
here are some links i have found online concerning the formats.
\these files are from star ocean 4 for xbox 360

quickbms script:

```
idstring SLZ
get TYPE byte
get DUMMY long
if DUMMY & 0xff
    endian little
else
    endian big
endif
get ZSIZE long
get SIZE long
get DUMMY long
get DUMMY long
savepos OFFSET
if TYPE == 0
    string NAME += ".unslz"
    log NAME OFFSET ZSIZE
elif TYPE == 4
    string NAME += ".xbcompress"
    log NAME OFFSET ZSIZE
else
    print "Error: unsupported type, contact me"
    cleanexit
endif
```

types:
0: uncompressed file
4: file compressed with xbcompress so use xbdecompress to unpack it.
obviously on playstation are used other compressions (like 2) but I have not had occasion to test them (I don't have the files)

Actually, some compilers do check buffer overruns - though these are not free.

what a great program. i've been looking for something like this for a long time. i have a question though. how come it works perfectly on king's quest 2 but fails to extract resources from king's quest 1, king's quest 3, and quest for glory 2. aren't they all using AGS 3.x? if not, aren't the previous versions of AGS supported?

I thought I should point out that we have a wiki page for [Fallout](http://wiki.xentax.com/index.php?title=Fallout), and from there a link to [http://falloutmods.wikia.com/wiki/DAT_file_format](http://falloutmods.wikia.com/wiki/DAT_file_format) - you may be able to improve support with this information.

Hi, I've recently rediscovered a game with great music/sfx/ambient sound and would like to extract the container files.
I've tried Gobread and Gobakery to extract the "music.packed" of "Clive Barker's Jericho", but none worked for me.
Via gobakery I got the following error: Run-time error "5": Invalid procedure call or argument.

I don't have a chance to try a x86 system. Is there a way to extract those files with a 64-bit win7 system or is it simply impossible?
Help would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks in advance.

(Shame on me, haven't read the whole thread. trying dosbox now...)

Dosbox just gives me message "Unable to open file", when trying cmd "gobread music.packed", any keen advice for a noob?

Thansk again.

GOBREAD is an extremely cool tool!
Unfortunately I'm also trying to load a game project made with AGS, for the purpose of translating the text in it, but AGS v3.2.1 gives an error loading the DTA file. The AGS project file extracted by GOBREAD is also named game28.dta. I think the game was started using AGS v2.x but converted to v3.2.0 later on by the developer, which indicates there should be an AGS file in xml format.
From the DTA header it reads:
STRING: Adventure Creator Game File v2*       3.2.0
HEX: 416476656E747572652043726561746F722047616D652046696C652076322A00000005000000332E322E30

It seems that the AGS developer changed the way the games are compiled so that the scripts cannot not be recovered or extracted.
Rumors say that the AGS developer himself could not decompile any 3.x game (which I'm pretty sure is all but a rumor). 
As a side note, everything else, including VOX files extraction, is perfect.

Does some one have an idea how I can use GOBREAD or any other technique to translate the text from an AGS game?
In essence, I'm trying to import the whole game into AGS just to translate the in-game text/subtitles.
I'm not even sure if this is the right approach to do what I'm trying to do (probably it's not), but if I still managed to translate, how would I reintegrate that in the compiled version of the game without AGS?

One way would be to ask the game developer but since it's a commercial game I'm pretty sure it's a dead end.

Great tool anyway, congrats!

Edit: Ok, sorry for babbling. I found a way of translating the game and using custom fonts. Just took me some spare time and a bit of hex-digging.

Have you successfully opened these files? I really want to be able to view all the Nancy Drew files, but currently these are the only two I have on my computer at the moment.

If I'm doing something wrong and that's why I'm getting that error. What is the proper extracting text that I need to type?

Isn't it easier to compile a new EXE?

I don't think "easier" is the right word for it. Anyway, how is a new compiled exe meant to fix his issue? Does a recompilation fix it by itself?
If his problem arises from a compatibility issue then I assume that parts of the code would have to be changed, which means that you have to know exactly what's causing it and then correct it properly. That may sound easy but only assuming that you have the head-start of knowing the problem and the solution for it (that is if you own the source-code). Anyway, shouldn't 64 bit processors (and OSes) be backward compatible to handle 32 bit applications? I thought it only didn't work the other way around.

A VM would definitively not be the solution but instead a workaround, in less than an hour you could set it up instead of waiting for someone to recompile a x64 version of the tool. Or you might want to know exactly why it won't run, there may be another solution that doesn't involve recompiling anything or a VM but since I don't own a 64 bit processor I'm just guessing.

I'm glad that this topic is still alive and I thank everybody who esteems it.

Unfortunatly for Win64-users this program is written purely in 16Bit-ASSEMBLER for DOS with a Win95-Interface and some tricks. Therefore it cannot be "recompiled" in any way for any other processor type or OS.
I'm really sorry that I don't know any circumvention for it.

Recommendation: to get it running maybe you have to allow "write access" for "code segments" in your DOS emulator software.

(2)And then i also a few information to asmxtx  and others.
In Nancy Drew 16,17,the pic file format is like some raw bmp file.
It looks likes this :

file head (18bytes)
24bit rgb raw data
Last line --->First line

and i have converted a pic to bmp by add a 54bytes bmp head with hand

(3)I have a question.
    How to convert cif file to TGA picture?
    Just change the file extend name or need add a file head?
    Gobread can extract Nancy Drew 1-19 all ?
    Can you add a to bmp option for nancy drew 16,17?

Can someone tell me exactly how to do this? I've got some files without extension. How do I convert them into images?

Greetings all, I just found this forum while on a deep dive search. I'm attempting to extract all the assets from Ominous Horizons: A Paladin's Calling. After many google searches I found this one forum post. It seems the task can be done and is supported. However I'm having a hard time getting this done. Is anyone familiar with extracting the .glm file? I would highly appreciate any assistance in this.

Thanks,
OldGreenandWise

This tool claims it supports extracting OMINOUS.GLM, however I've never gotten it to work with it either. Just a "File format not recognized" error.

EDIT: Nevermind, I'm wrong. It just doesn't support automatic detection for that format. Just do: 
```
gobread.exe ominous.glm -OMINOUS
```

Hi,
Stolen .bcb file cannot be extracted correctly. It stops after the fourth file:
[](https://ibb.co/rcRsCDW)
The file is the main file „pc.bcb”.

Hello

I've tried to use this tool to rip files from the cancelled 100 bullets videogame. File name is STREE0.TRE and I thought it would be okay to rip. This message appears on screen. 



Hope some other coding developer see this to check if we can someday check what we are missing (models, textures, etc.) I suck ass at programming lol

asmxtx has not logged on the forum since 2015. I wouldn't count on any support.
