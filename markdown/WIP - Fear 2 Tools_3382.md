- Post Title: WIP - Fear 2 Tools

Greetings,

I made a few tools for game fear 2, maybe somebody could find them useful 
Some of them are not finished yet because of shitty new fear 2 protection which prevents "researching" game executable....

Anyway, I decided to release few of them:
-Arch01 Extractor
-BNDL Extractor
-TEX Converter
-SND Extractor

ARCH Extractor is like ArchNoah, but this tool is made epecially for Fear 2, archive files are also different from fear 1, because fear 2 uses deflate compression in arch01 format.

BNDL Extractor is for extracting bundle file format, which is in fear engine new thing, it has a simple structure, but game seems to be not working without bndl archives, but I'm 101% sure that there is way how to enable loading from unpacked bndl archives...

TEX Converter is really simple tool, which converts TEX files to DDS files and back...

SND Extractor is not finished, extractor will extract sounds as .wav format but without correct filenames... filenames are saved in sound database (Game\database_sound\SoundDB.gamedb), I found how to obtain correct filenames from database but that structure looks so unregular and hard to understand, so I did not finished this tool....


Download:

```


---------------------------------
HELP: If you have some time and you with to help with researching gamedb file format, please let me know, I send you examples, or you can download demo... your help will be appreciated a lot 
HELP: Also I need to find a way how to force fear2 to load files from unpacked bndl archives, I think that problem is in database files
HELP:  I found almost all commandline arguments for fear 2, but I dont know how to use them, it seems that they must be written in command line file (fear2.exe -cmdfile cmdline.txt)
HELP: Demo version of Fear2 uses securom protection  do anybody know how to remove it ? if yes then please PM me

For editing Fear 1, you can use a mod sdk which is already released, for fear 2, you must wait  because you must import and export models, so you need 2 tools  

Anyway, I think I'll finish snd tool this week

Could I request the SND extractor?  Just finished the game and the music is awesome. It'd be terrific if someone could make a tool so that we can all listen to the great music.

My best suggestion, when you are ready to unpack the individual .bndl files in their directories: Just follow what I did.
Open up the "readme.txt" in the same folder
Making sure you have "wordwrap" disabled in notepad, copy the last line in the text file, or you can copy it from here
Code: Select allBndlExtractor.exe -batch ".\" ".\extracted\" -d
Create a text file in the BndlExtractor.exe directory
Rename the txt file "run.bat"
right click it and select "edit"
Paste the command here and save -> close
Copy both the BndlExtractor.exe and run.bat into the directory you want to start unpacking
double click the run.bat, and run to execute the batch command
Watch it go through all the bndl files in the directory, and delete the ones it's finished.
Repeat through each directory until you're finished!

You can actually just paste this in the root directory of entire game content folder.  I'd suggest making a duplicate folder for this purpose first.  It'll output the entire contents of every subdirectory to the "extracted" folder, retaining the folder structure.  

I've noticed that for each of the single and multiplayer world bndls there's a crap ton of redundant textures meshes, etc...!!!

The ArchExtractor and BndlExtractor work fine (batch files) but i'm having a few problems with the TexConverter.  The converter works with single files but when i try to create a bat file to deal with a batch, the program crashes  .  Tried to follow the example in the readme file but i'm not getting anywhere.  I'm not that well versed in command line tools so i think i'm just creating an incorrect bat file command - any help (or is there a standard tool to convert tex to dds) - thanks.

Tex files are held in a single folder 'textures' on my H drive.

I've been having the exact same problem. I've not a clue why it won't work even as instructed with the readme.

Edit - kicking myself here - TEXConverter.exe -batch -tex ".\" ".\DDS\" -d

Converted all tex files to DDS from fear2, wasn't using the correct command line for the bat file.

I'm trying to use these tools on Condemned2 (same engine) but no luck...

Unfortunately, it also looks like there still is no model converter-importer/exporter either (for either game)

The download link for these tools is offline of course.

Does anyone have a working download link for these or other FEAR 2 tools?

Sorry for a possible necro but how did you get the Arch Extractor working? Everytime I double click it it doesn't do anything, and using command prompt says its not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file.

it's does 101% working 

1. unpack the arch01's
2. create a directory in root gamedir with the full name of the arch: "Layer02.Arch01"
3. unpack the BNDLs inside with deletion:
h:\FEAR2GOG\Layer02.Arch01\Worlds\sp\m01_penthouse>BndlExtractor.exe -batch ".\"
 ".\" -d

4. move all the files from within h:\FEAR2GOG\Layer02.Arch01\Worlds\sp\m01_penthouse into root of the arch's dir:
H:\FEAR2GOG\Layer02.Arch01\Worlds\sp\m01_penthouse\*.* > H:\FEAR2GOG\Layer02.Arch01

5. in contrast, move all the *.wld*, *.gamedb, *.lvbndl  (files only) etc that you see now inside H:\FEAR2GOG\Layer02.Arch01
and move them into H:\FEAR2GOG\Layer02.Arch01\Worlds\sp\m01_penthouse\*

known bugs: videos are not working - you will see the displays are gray and so are any intro scenes
many game events don't work: for example in the first level the elevator doesn't open
I think these bugs can be fixed by testing and finding the correct bndl file that contains the events/videos
for example the event for the elevator in the first level is located in m01_penthouse_0001.bndl
and the texture flicker bug is fixed with m01_penthouse_0028.bndl

this is not very practical for modding, going over 100's of files every time to fix one problem at a time
I think for texture modding it's best to use external tool like uMod or TexMod and paint a good layer of your own shaders with reshade
extracting BNDL only necessary for modding the rest of the game, for example I used it to remove the grapple from the abomination monsters

Is there anyway to extract sounds with correct sound filenames from the SoundDB.gamedb?

I have the bms script here for sounds.

```
# names may be in Game\database_sound\SoundDB.gamedb
 
get BASE_NAME basename
get FILE_SIZE asize
 
get DUMMY long
get ENTRIES long
get ENTRIES_OFFSET long
get HEADERS_OFFSET long
get DATA_OFFSET long
 
set I long 0
 
#extract data directly, ignoring headers
 
for OFFSET = DATA_OFFSET < FILE_SIZE
  goto OFFSET
 
  get SIZE long
  math SIZE += 0x08
 
  string NAME p= "%s__%04i.snd" BASE_NAME I
 
  log NAME OFFSET SIZE
 
  math OFFSET += SIZE
  math I += 1
 
next
 
 
 
# failed attempt to extract in header order
# some files don't seem to have proper pointers
 
#goto ENTRIES_OFFSET
#
#for I = 0 < ENTRIES
#  get ID long
#  get ENTRY_OFFSET long
#  savepos CURRENT
#
#  goto ENTRY_OFFSET
#  get SUBFILES long
#  math ENTRY_OFFSET += 0x10
#
#  for J = 0 < SUBFILES
#    #there is a mini header but is also in the extracted file
#    math ENTRY_OFFSET += 0x18
#    goto ENTRY_OFFSET
#    get OFFSET long
#    math ENTRY_OFFSET += 0x08
#
#    math OFFSET += DATA_OFFSET
#    goto OFFSET
#    get SIZE long
#    math SIZE += 0x08
#
#    string NAME p= "%s__%03i_%02i.snd" BASE_NAME I J
#    print "EN=%ENTRY_OFFSET|h%, OFF=%OFFSET|h% SZ=%SIZE|h%"
#    log NAME OFFSET SIZE
#  next J
#
#  goto CURRENT
#next I

I know this is old but a friend of mine found a version of F.E.A.R. 2 that is 4 month prior to the release and there are some models and textures that we want from there, the thing is that this tool says that the version is to old to open, is there any way to open it?
