- Post Title: Using Ninja Ripper in MAME

Does anyone know of a possible way to get access to 3D models in MAME? I was trying it with Ninja Ripper but it only saved screenshots. Is their a older version that actually runs the rom without just giving it to the cpu? If not, can you get Ninja Ripper to still rip models some other way?

Mame doesn't pass polygons to your gpu. The cpu calculates them.
So no 3d models to rip from your graphics card with ninja ripper or 3dripperx. I've tried it before...
