- Post Title: Various Playstation 2 Textures (Help or Links Needed)

I know that someone on the forums has already half-way succeeded in ripping the texture files (coded TIM2 from what the thread states) from the first Fatal Frame game, I'm trying to do the same but with all three of the games.

My problem is the fact that no matter how many google searches I've done, no matter how many wikis I've read, and barely having an understanding of how the tutorials for the ripper programs work, I'm still no closer to being able to understand -how- to rip these texture files from these console games.

I know how to rip FMVs, I know how to get sounds, and I definately know how to rip the DVDs into ISO packages if anyone requires one for research but the problem I'm having is I just can't figure out how to rip the texture files from these, or other games that I'm working on. Inlcuding (but not limited to) : Castlevania : Lament of Innocence (and Curse of Darkness), Star Ocean : Till the End of Time, and Genji, Dawn of the Samurai. 

I've tried every available resource I can think of and Xentax was the last place I finally managed to find, I'm at my wits end, and I've done far too much research into this to let the effort go down into the drain, is there anyone that can either help me with this, point me in the right direction or even just throw me a link to a tutorial on how to rip the texture files from these games? I know I should be doing this myself but I'm at the end of my rope here and It's become frustrating with the amount of research I've been doing just trying to find at least a straight forward way of doing this, I know that the files can be heavily encrypted, and I also know that it'd take time to dig through the mess that is a game archive in order to find the files that I want/need, but I seriously need a push in the right direction for the games I mentioned above... again I'll repeat the games that I need texture ripping help with. 

Castlevania : Lament Of Innocence (Archive Type .BIN, Can Provide ISO)
Castlevania : Curse Of Darkness (Archive Type .BIN (includes a Dummy.BIN), Can Provide ISO)
Genji: Dawn Of The Samurai (Archive Type .DAT, Can Provide ISO)
Star Ocean : Till The End Of Time (Disk 1 and 2, Archive Type Unknown, Possibly Hidden/Encrypted, Square Enix Disc, can Provide ISO)
Fatal Frame 1, 2, 3 (Archive Types .BIN respectively. Can Provide ISO)

I'm horribly sorry to sound like such a noob here, but I don't know what else to do, <_< just don't rip me apart too hard.
