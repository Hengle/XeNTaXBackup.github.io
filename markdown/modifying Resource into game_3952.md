- Post Title: modifying Resource into game?

hi!
Also that you good understand my question.
A resource for me, is a Dialog box, string or  Window form game. So for any year i have started to modify language of software with software as Reseditor or any other. But Game are a lot different. Under game The standard Resources don't give access. So first i have found via PDG Packer, that my software has "Microsoft Visual C++ 7.0" and nothing compress method.

I have found, that any Resource of game are stored into Section.
So my first question, because i don't have many knowledge about Edit section. What contain this type of section. can this section contain Window size....?
.Rsrc
.Data
.Rdata
.Txt
and a last section, we don't are named. 

If yes, give it a possibility to extract this section, and after modification, replace it with old file?

Because to first, i would modify Size From Window. (Game contain any Resolution, but don't permit to play with twin monitor)
By Game start, on first, Game call a Window and go into window mode.
but to now with Debugger i don't have chance to seek or to can breakpoint on this window, use microsoft visual c++ 7.0 programming reference special API , for Window?
to first i say you many thank's to all help we you can me done, which permit that i can follow my works.
