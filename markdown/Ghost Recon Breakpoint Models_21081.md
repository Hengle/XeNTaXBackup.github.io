- Post Title: Ghost Recon: Breakpoint Models

The closed beta is now live and open beta coming in a couple of weeks so I was wondering if Anvil or that tool daemon1 made for Wildlands would support Breakpoint at any point. Interested in getting Nomad and John Bernthal's Cole Walker out of the game.
