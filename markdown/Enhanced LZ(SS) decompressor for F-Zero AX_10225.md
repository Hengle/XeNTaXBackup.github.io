- Post Title: Enhanced LZ(SS) decompressor for F-Zero AX

GameZelda's excellent GXPAND unpacks F-Zero GX's ARC and LZ files, but cannot decompress F-Zero AX's LZ files. GXPAND's "binarystream.d" has a debug feature which could prove useful to make GXPAND be AXPAND. Hopefully with F-Zero AX boot in GX blowing up recently, some will be motivated to get GXPAND working for AX. More info here: [http://tcrf.net/Talk:F-Zero_AX](http://tcrf.net/Talk:F-Zero_AX) 

Most of the work is done. All it needs is some tweaking.
