- Post Title: -- Encrypted zip -- BeamNG Drive

Hello people, 
After drifting thru internet, downloading bunch of useless tools, no one could open this
encrypted zip full of audio files from BeamNG Drive game

80 MB [https://drive.google.com/open?id=144b-e ... kpa3KWxw4e](https://drive.google.com/open?id=144b-eAcaw6YBXTcokPLOZzkpa3KWxw4e)

If this is so hard to open, why all game companies don't use this method...
can someone with skills try, I'm willing to pay...
