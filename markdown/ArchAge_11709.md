Open beta hype! 

Release is not too far off now. ArcheAge is a step in the right direction for MMORPGs, I can't wait for the live servers to go up for real.

What's that other one coming in the future, Black Desert or something like that? Looks very good, too.

I've been able to play it. Not an MMO lover but still liked it. Really good mechanics and controls.
