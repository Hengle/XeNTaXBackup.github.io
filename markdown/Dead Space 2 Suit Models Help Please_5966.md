Hey everyone, I'm new here, so I don't have the slightest clue what to do. Anyways, I would really love it if I could get my hands on the Models for the Dead Space 2 Suits (I currently have the 360 version) If you guys could help me out and tell me what to do to get them, that would be great and much appreciated.

Also, if they could be openable in 3DS Max, that would be all the better

why you need those models?

p.s.: take a printscreen of  root directory of the game and attach here

Hello! I need those models too, and just like the starter of this topic, I'm a noob as well (sorry  ). I'm an art school student, and we have to make statues for our final exams, I chose to build Isaac (which would be pretty impossible without his 3D models)

Is this what you need?

So, now we know that all resources including models in the several big *.dat files, researching of this archives going [here](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=5881).

So... now what? Will we wait for some kind of program that can open and extract those files?

yes, we need to wait for unpacking model files from *.dat files.

Model files (*.geo) are generally found in stream sets (*.str), which are inside the archives (*.dat/*.viv).

The suits can be found in DS2DAT9.DAT\global_assets\global_assets\ds_assets\char_str\plyr\plyr_unfm.

An example: unimedpatient.str (this would be the straitjacket from the beginning of the game)

Here are the unpacked contents of unimedpatient.str: [http://www.multiupload.com/ILCF0000YZ](http://www.multiupload.com/ILCF0000YZ)

Hey guys, I'm working on a maxscript for the .geo files that was posted before. The verts were pretty straight forward.

the whole model format is dead easy its almost the same as obj. just need the header sorted out to reach the offset table then you can import anything.

try changing some of the flaots your reading to half floats for uv's.
also dante's inferno is the same format

hi everyone, im newbie and i wonder how can i extract the original models from game datas 
it would be great if u tell me with full details plz i need to do that,i need models from dead space 1 and 2
and if there is without UV plz tell me cuz i dont have any problem with UV.

Chrrox, it seems that I have failed lol
I tried all possible half floats for the uvs, but they either give me nothing or a randomly huge mess. Maybe the half float function is wrong? (the function is in the script above).

I'm so close to finishing, this the only thing that needs to be done.

I thought that might be it. I've found the offset to the UVs, but it seems that it doesn't match the number of vertices though.

Edit: That can't be it, the section past the faces are the same in each file.

Edit2: Ok I have finally found it. It's in a different file.
torso example: The mesh is in Mesh/0144_torsoupper.geo and the UVs are in MeshVolatile/0145_torsoupper.geo

Phew, ok, I am done. So it's the same deal guys with maxscripts. 
Copy the code below, open up 3DS Max, Maxscript Menu>New Script, then paste, save, Maxscript Menu>Run Script, select the script you saved.

Now it's going to ask for the mesh file, so open up a .geo in the "Mesh" folder eg. 0144_torsoupper.geo
Then it's going to ask for the UV file which is also a .geo file, but should be in the "MeshVolatile" folder eg. 0145_torsoupper.geo
Notice that the number is different, lower is the mesh and greater is the UV.

14/02/11 Edit: Fixed the code so it didn't suck...

23/02/11 Edit 2: The .geo format is really inconsistent, so I've added an "if statement" for more compatibility.

6/03/11 Edit 3: Found another face count, should fix problems with files that have multiple meshes

Oh really?  I only tried two meshes and it worked so I thought it would of been the same.
Well I'm at uni at the moment so I'll fix it when I get home.

@renato - I'll fix it soon. Also could you upload those files?

thx thx thx thx

edit:

While I was exploring the files I found a strange thing:


the files:
[0131_mesh_rarm00_dism.geo](http://www.4shared.com/file/-CVBSeGd/0131_mesh_rarm00_dism.html)
[0132_mesh_rarm00_dism.geo](http://www.4shared.com/file/xkPUh3uQ/0132_mesh_rarm00_dism.html)

@Nexus Elite ns and renato
Whoa, those files are different, from the others.

The vertices don't seem to follow the same pattern. This will probably take awhile, sooo..back to drawing board again.

Well you're doing your best at least. Thanks for doing the script for the community.

Though, it strange that there some missing GEO files for the mesh and UV, is anyone else missing few parts from geo? I think the STR unpacker isn't fully working.

Just a quick question:

When you export the GEOs into 3Ds Max and open the Material Editor you can see that the textures are already applied to the mesh.
Are the texture coordinates correct?
And does somebody know how to convert the TG4D textures?
Thanks!

Well it could be possible that the texture UVs are flipped, but we can't be sure until the textures are properly ripped. Rick has a slightly working converter, but I don't think the results are perfect yet.

Hey, sorry for the extremely stupid question I'm going to ask, but here it goes.

Does the script work on DS1 models? When I try, it says it needs Geo UV's, and so far I'm unable to find a file that has the same Name which could correspond to the GEO containing the UV's.

Also, the errors reports back as --Float.

Stupid question, I know, so I was just wondering.

I'm not sure if it's the same, I don't have any of the games. It could possibly be different, post a couple of samples and I'll quickly check.

Well, it's similar. The only difference is the information is in a different offset and the UV's are kept at the bottom of the file instead of separately. So a separate script is needed.

hey everyone. im new here so im trying to learn along with what everyone on here is explaining. ive been able to open the files in the 3ds max program (geo format i believe), but my problem is this. So far i only have the helmet (advanced) file and the shin for the legs. Is there any way you guys could post the geo files for the rest of the advanced suit so i can use those as well? i have no idea how to extract the files if that is what you guys are doing (again, new to this so sorry if my terms are off). I was hoping on using these files to put a suit together. Hope you guys can help me out, thank you for your time, and good luck with your progress!

They also don't have any missing mesh that the .geo exporter seems to mess up when ever there are 2 models attached together as a single mesh but have separate bitmaps and one doesn't show the faces but the vertexs are there. I'll bring this issue up to nightflare unless he knows.

I also have Isaac in the Straight Jacket but im fixing him up. And im fixing up the advanced suit.

Also when I mean grab the textures I mean ALL of them. DLC and what not.

I've just updated the script [viewtopic.php?p=49117#p49117](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?p=49117#p49117)

The .geo format is really inconsistent, so I've added an "if statement" for more compatibility, the problem was that there are two face counts in the file, sometimes they are the same, and sometimes they aren't which caused some faces not to be read. So I simply made the script choose the larger face count.

I haven't fixed the other problems yet (probably won't get to).

What other problem would that be?

Dead Space 3 used 3 float value for UV coordinate (may be UVW???). Third WORD is usually 000000ff.
Adaptation of the nightFlarer's script for it:

```
caption:"Open .geo from Mesh folder" \
types:"Dead Space 2 Mesh(*.geo)|*.geo" \
historyCategory:"DeadSpace2ObjectPresets"
f = fopen fname "rb"
gname = getOpenFileName \
caption:"Open .geo from MeshVolatile folder" \
types:"Dead Space 2 UV(*.geo)|*.geo" \
historyCategory:"DeadSpace2ObjectPresets"
g = fopen gname "rb"
clearlistener()
fscale=100

for x = 1 to indices/3 do(

append Face_array[fa,fb,fc]
)
Print ("Last Read @ 0x"+((bit.intAsHex(ftell f))as string))

msh = mesh vertices:Vert_array faces:Face_array
msh.numTVerts = UV_array.count
buildTVFaces msh
for j = 1 to UV_array.count do setTVert msh j UV_array[j]

Print ("Last Read @ 0x"+((bit.intAsHex(ftell f))as string))

```


Add only one string:

```
tw=readfloat g
```
