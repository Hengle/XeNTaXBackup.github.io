- Post Title: [Yulgang] 3D model (.bon) of Yulgang

Hi there everyone,

I would like to know if there're some methods to open the model file of Yulgang?
One model consists of .bon, .skin and .ani file.

I searched once and found the python script for Neosis (which I included in the file); however, when I exported the models from this script and applied texture to the model, some parts of the model were miscolored.

And I'm really noob on editing or writing codes but I just want to learn how to extract models for my guidebook (just for my collection).

If anyone is willing to teach me, I will really appreciate that and I will try my best to learn and understand.

Thank you so much.

Here is the python script I used:

If you need the game files, please pm me.
