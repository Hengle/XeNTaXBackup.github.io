- Post Title: [Wii] Arc Rise Fantasia - .wtm files

Hi, so I'm looking to rip the portraits from the game Arc Rise Fantasia.

A quick search on the forums showed that there have been a lot of threads about this game. Specifically, these posts:

[viewtopic.php?p=75978#p75978](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?p=75978#p75978)
[viewtopic.php?t=4893&f=18](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?t=4893&f=18)

My problem is that I have no idea how to use this information to get to the portraits. (Do I open the .wtm files in TileGGD or a similar program?)

Any help would be greatly appreciated.
