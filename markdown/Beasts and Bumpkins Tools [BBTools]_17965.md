I've disassembled BB and created the tools.
Language is C# with MonoGame.

In BBTools/additions you can find pseudocode of some functions from BEASTS.EXE.
Ambient and Speach are in TODO.

Without you, this would have been impossible.

Hello,

I am interested in modifying the beasts.exe in a hex editor to increase the resolution of the game. I was able to modify it and increase the size by 
searching for for 80020000E001 and replace the entire thing with 000500000004 for 1280x1024.

This makes the play area bigger like this picture [https://imgur.com/gallery/7pJkok0](https://imgur.com/gallery/7pJkok0) I also moved the portrait with these 

At offset 29714 replace 1C 02 with 9C 04 
At offset 2972D replace 7C 01 with 9C 03.

The only problem I have left are the thought bubble (not critical)
Sprites like houses and monsters sometimes disappear if they are outside the original 640x480 area. I am guessing there is some kind of clipping or frustum culling going on to increase performance.

Since you have disassebled the exe do you have any idea where  this might be?

Thanks.

Hello,

As far as I'm concerned, modifying game files using a hex editor may prove interesting. As regards the disappearance of sprites outside the original area, it's likely that some form of clipping or frustration reduction has been implemented in the game to optimize performance.
