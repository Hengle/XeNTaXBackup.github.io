- Post Title: .fsm files Resident Evil 7

I've been looking through RE7 trying to find the scripts for the game. I'm pretty confident that they are stored in the .fsm files, which can be backed up by older RE games. Does anyone know how I would go about extracting them? I got the header (HFSM). Also, I dumped one of the .fsm files which can be found here: [https://pastebin.com/UjDDVyXk](https://pastebin.com/UjDDVyXk)

Thanks
