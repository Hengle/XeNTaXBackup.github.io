What's your H2O file?

btw: I remember having had a similar problem but that was with integers, not half floats.
But this time it's different: it's uv data used with a (wrong) 3rd coordinate to make them vertices, haha.

I have finished my Sword and Romance *.bmesh load module.

I have released the following program:
- 3D Object Converter v10.007 (Windows)

How to get the 3D Object Converter v10.007:
Download the 3D Object Converter from [ http://3doc.i3dconverter.com](http://3doc.i3dconverter.com) and install it or download and use the portable version (if you don’t have it yet).
(Or just use the Help/Check for updates... function to get the v10.007.)
