- Post Title: Error Decompressing

Hi there

I am currently editing Project Earth Starmageddon and I have been trying to change the vehicle names. All of the names are stored in .txt files but every time i try to open them in MultiEX Comander it says: "Error Decompressing " 

I really need help with this because this is (so far) the only program that supports this game. So does anyone have a solution?

Do you have an example file?

I see. This is due to the script. It assumes all files are compressed. But some are not. It then attempts to decompress a non-compressed file and fails.

I'm working on a new update of the package, I will add an option for the program to extract files even though decompression fails. Meanwhile, I'll see if I can make a workaround script.
