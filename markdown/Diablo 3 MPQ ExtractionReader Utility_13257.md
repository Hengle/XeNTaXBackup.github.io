Hello yall.

I was wondering if you guys found a Diablo 3 MPQ extraction/reader utility?
I did found one blogspot page, but am not too sure if it's the real deal as it is a blog site and I want secondary references.

Alright, is there any utility that allows the conversion of those .cel things into a common image file format? I tried out drtesterv2, allows views, animation, and export into image file format. Any of that?

Actually, I read around that between Diablo 3 and its predecessors are so different in aesthetics that it would be its own game. I heard 'WOW' mmrpg, and I assume it's a bit too light for the Diablo exception. Oh well, I guess I can forget about it.
