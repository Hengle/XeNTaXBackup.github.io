Okay, I think I managed to unpack the GT.VOL from Gran Turismo 5, but there were some .swf files inside, from 300mb to 1.8gb.   
I uplaoded the smallest one so maybe someone could work further and see what's in it...


upload is in 2 parts [http://www.upload.ee/files/2299793/File ... .rar.html
](http://www.upload.ee/files/2299793/File0007.part1.rar.html)
[http://www.upload.ee/files/2299794/File ... 2.rar.html](http://www.upload.ee/files/2299794/File0007.part2.rar.html)


I'd be glad if someone could take a look at it and help out a bit...


Best,
J

I have read it at least 4 times, but still... nobody even gives a shit about this game anymore as it seems. Give me an idea how to try to extract it or at least find information about headers and stuff...

I'm not looking for anyone to do this for me, I just need someone to show me how to do it.
