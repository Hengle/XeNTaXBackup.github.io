- Post Title: Survarium .db (vostok games)

Game: [http://survarium.com/en](http://survarium.com/en)

I tried using the STALKER bms script for db files and got the following error:

[](http://imgbox.com/YqSm4O5P)

Things to note:
- I used the 4 gb QuickBMS and the .db file is only 3.13 gb
- This game is made by the same people who made STALKER and the archive has the same extension type
- Dragon Unpacker was able to pull many textures from the archive and they appear to be the same as what is previous db packages from Vostok

I'd be more than happy to help however I can if someone is willing to produce a bms script that will work on this archive.

Aluigi -- thank you again for all your effort. It's appreciated more than you know.

Edit: The textures unpack as normal dds. The models come without extensions. I'll post samples later this evening.
