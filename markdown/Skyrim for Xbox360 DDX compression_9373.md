- Post Title: Skyrim for Xbox360 DDX compression

I could use some help with this
linked are some ddx files and their dds equivalents from the PC install

The first 0x40 are the typical header which we haven't completely figured out yet. Then follows 3 DWORD values of lengths of compressed sections. If I save a compressed section to a new file, the comtype script seems to decompress but looks like maybe it is adding some garbage. xbdecompress (2.0.7645.0) gives me error: file was not compressed in a native form

There is other info here but a bunch of flaming and off topic crap -> xbox360iso.com/showthread.php?t=598342&highlight=3xdr
