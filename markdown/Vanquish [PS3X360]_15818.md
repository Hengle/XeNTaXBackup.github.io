Hi, guys! I need a man who will reveal all text from the game PS3 version.
It is necessary to develop a tool that can extract text and pack it back. And Fonts too.

Can anybody help me?

forgiveness for raising this topic, but does anyone know where the texts are located, and is there already some tool to extract it or method of editing them?
