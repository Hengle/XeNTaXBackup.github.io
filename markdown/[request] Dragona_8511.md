- Post Title: [request] Dragona

I tested the script Finale made to Queens Blade in Dragona and its really good  , the bad think its this doesnt work with lots of .mesh files  , here two folders, one with items objects like weapons (plugin works here), other with Armor Parts (plugin doestn work here)  hope finally can take a view of this.

EDIT: I found wath happend, the plugin load all the models in a single folder not only selected, if the folder have lots of meshes Noesis crash, to work need put the mesh file on single folder, and put then the .amo,mtl,xmtl,tmlib,txmsrc file of the model, that its i put and work fine, if i have error please correct.

Thanks Finale

Hmm, there aren't that many models in the folder you sent though.
I'm wondering why it freezes on like, 20 files (when it loads C9 maps which is like, 60+ files at a time)

Does it crash, or does it freeze? And when does it happen, when you actually load a model, or just when you view the folder in Noesis?

chrrox was saying he had some file viewing freezes, but he hasn't been able to reproduce them, and I suspect I fixed the issue he was having already. (kind of suspect it was the message pump choke issue)

Well its hard tell if its freeze or crash, on windows 7 the window for crash and freeze its the same, X program stop working wath u like, close, continue or go to the farm and live happy with you poppies and forget the computers.
