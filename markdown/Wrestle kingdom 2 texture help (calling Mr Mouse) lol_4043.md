Ok theres a tool on this forum that lets you extract (somewhat) wrestle kingdom 2 textures from the game. I edited the tool so you can preview the textures accuratelly without having to rename it to png but what I need is for it to have an extract all option. Because honestly extrscting one at a time is a pain in the ass so please help me out Mr. Mouse lol

You have source code? How did you edit the tool? If you have source code you can program an extract all option yourself? I'm uncertain what you ask.

Are there still example files? RTX3 files?

I read this in that old thread: 

```
TotalSize As Long
Long1 As Long
Long2 As Long
Long3 As Long
Short1 As Integer
Short2 As Integer
Long4 As Long
Long5 As Long
ImageWidth As Integer
ImageHeight As Integer
ImageSize As Long
Short3 As Integer
Null1 As Integer
Null2 As Integer
Null3 As Integer
Null4 As Integer
Null5 As Integer
Null6 As Integer
Null7 As Integer
Null8 As Integer
NumberOfColors As Integer
OffsetToClut As Long 

```


These were the specs of the archives?

Doesn't anybody read the rules? MEGAUPLOAD is prohibited, take another File Sharing Service! 

And why did you not compress the file with 7z first??

Well, tell that someone to compress large files first using 7z on maximum setting, so you have minimal upload and download times.

Is there a trick to fix the Wrestle Kingdom 2 textures when you export them so they look correct and do not end up like this?  The green streaks are correct, the red and green dots on the belly and chest are not  supposed to be there (in case you are unfamiliar with Darkness Muta).  There is also a red cross in the middle of the center green streak on the chest and back.



I am hoping Mr. Mouse or Snyperstyle might know the answer.

Well, do you have the original image?This could mean anything, from RGB flip to differences in transpareny (I think the latter is the case).

That is the image that is exported from the Data.dip file Snyperstyle posted a post above my previous one when using RTXplorer that he posted in the first topic here.

I dont have an answer for you owne some files look great others look off its an issue of alpha Im pretty sure of it. Thats why I asked for Mouse's help since he solved that issue on the SVR paint tool for us.
