- Post Title: Rise of The Guardians .HNK file

Hi, does anyone know how to extract the models from hnk files? I was able to get some of the textures(not all of them), and some weird files like rendertemplate, I just want the 3d mesh of the characters, dont need bone, any tool?

here the file: contain ps3 and xbox version

Looks doable, used hex2obj, not "a tool", just a helper:

OOh, I tried to get them, but I think i dont have those skill yet, how much would you ask to rip them?
its 5 models + 4 npcs
(Jack, Toothiana, North, Bunnymund, Sandman and the npcs Jamie, Sophie and Pitch)
I dont know if the npcs still unable to get since its on a a file with a lot of files(I can extract but the file is some kind of template and may be corrupted)
I dont care about rig or bones, since I plan to rework on them if get them, just want mesh and uv

I usually don't work on demand.  
Here's Jack; you'll have to rotate/move his hair.

When importing into blender, don't "split by object/group" or you'll have dozens of sub meshes.

Thank you so much for ripping him, I load him and its so nice, will rework on him since the texture is really low, will send you a pm

Does anyone have any thoughts on how to extract the character models (PS3 version)? I have the textures in good quality from Ninjaripper, but can't get the unposed models. All tools have failed and/or simply dumped a ton of .dat files that I can't do anything with.

amazing! I can't believe the meshes are visible with this! Don't worry about texture extraction if it's any trouble, those can be obtained with ninjaripper. The meshes really are the main obstacle.
