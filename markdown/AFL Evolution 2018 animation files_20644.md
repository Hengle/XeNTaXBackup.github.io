- Post Title: AFL Evolution 2018 animation files

Hi, I am trying to get usable animation files to import into Unity or Unreal from the game:
AFL Evolution - [https://store.steampowered.com/app/4350 ... Evolution/](https://store.steampowered.com/app/435020/AFL_Evolution/)
I downloaded the demo and extracted the assets from pak.waz file, it includes a /player/animation directory.
I have included a sample of some of the animation files and also a model/rig to apply them to.
The animation files have a .wwa extension (also some smaller .wwsa files for some as well), I believe this
stands for Wicked Witch Animation file, a custom file format.
It could have originally been mocap data fed into 3ds max.  
I assume the files would include vertex data for the skeleton and maybe a 3x2/3 array for the
transform/rotation/(scale if used).
Magic byte is 49 00 00 00 for .wwa and 1E 00 00 00 for .wwsa
Was hoping someone could provide some guidance or a tool to convert the data if possible?
Thanks.
