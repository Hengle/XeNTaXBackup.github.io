- Post Title: Help extracting a "CustomAssetBundle"

Hi!, I've been trying to extract this CustomAssetBundle from an old game called "FusionFall", but I can't find any way to extract it, and I was wondering if someone here could help.

Here is the bundle: [https://www.dropbox.com/s/pg5942aogxb00 ... ounds?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/pg5942aogxb004n/CustomAssetBundle-TrainingGrounds?dl=0)

I've tried that but it gives me an error message. I'm pretty sure the bundle was made with a custom version of Unity, so I think that might be why it doesn't work.
