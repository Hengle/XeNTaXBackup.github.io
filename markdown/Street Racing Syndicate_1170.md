Well, can you upload the first 512 kb and the last 512 kb?

You can use a hexeditor such as Hex Workshop to save only parts of a file.

Thanks...

Actually, I don't think I got the email either - I was getting mixed up with another game archive I was sent - sorry about that. We won't be able to go any further until we get the last part of the archive.
