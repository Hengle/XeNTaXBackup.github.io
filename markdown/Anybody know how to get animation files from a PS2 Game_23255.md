- Post Title: Anybody know how to get animation files from a PS2 Game?

Hey, I'm a dataminer who's looking to learn how to extract animations from a PS2 Game. I typically use powerISO to open any ISO or .bin file, but I cannot for the life of me seem to be able to find animations. On my two most recent datamines [GOW 2 and Berserk PS2] I was able to find basically everything except the animation files. Do you think that perhaps it requires the use of a hexeditor like how getting the character models from these 2 games did? Hoping I can come across some help here, i turned that Berserk PS2 game inside out looking for the animation files. I know people have found the animation files before with games like KH1 and so on, so I'm genuinely curious if any programs relating to other game's model viewers could help me access and/or convert these files? Or if anyone here has also datamined Berserk PS2/GOW 2 and can give me some good leads?

Thanks a ton for help, sorry to bother y'all with two almost 20-year old games.
