- Post Title: How to re-encrypt Xenoblade's .pkh archive

Hi guys,

So I can easily extract Xenoblade's ".pkh" archive format using this QuickBMS script made by Falo. ([viewtopic.php?f=10&p=39728](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=10&p=39728)) My question is...how can I extract a pkh, edit some files, and then make it a working .pkh file again?

I tried using QuickBMS's "repack" tool but no dice with the bms script I used before. It seems like it has to be modified.

I'm trying to replace cutscenes, but I first have to figure out how to replace character models, as that's much easier.

Anyone got any ideas?
