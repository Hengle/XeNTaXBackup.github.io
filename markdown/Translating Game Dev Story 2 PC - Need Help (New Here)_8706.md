Hey guys Just wondering if anyone could help me out with this last portion of translation. I've pretty much translated the entire "Game Dev Story 2" PC game. The problem i'm having is the actuall text  conversation strings are nowhere to be found in the HEX of the .exe file (which is the only file the game comes with). At first I thought they might be using images for dialog but this has been ruled out as on other peoples computer the dialog shows up as "????????" due to them not having native Japanese support on there machines.  






Now I've looked I stumbled upon this forum thanks to Google and you guys seem to know a TON of information of game translating or hacking period. I just found out about Quickbms and I really have no idea how to write a script for it. But I did find this interesting bit of information in the .exe file.



.Text
.Data
.RSRC

I was wondering if these files could be extracted from the .exe file. I think they may possibly hold the dialog.

Or I could have no clue what im talking about.. Any help would be 10000000x appreciated.
