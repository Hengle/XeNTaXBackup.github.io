Hello to everyone on this forum, my name's Joe, and i want to know if there's any way for rip cars models from Midnight Club LA or if someone know how to do it, i always been really interested for those models but i never tried to extract them from the game, so i don't know if is really possible, i know this game have some things in common with GTA so i guess can be easy get those models or maybe is just impossible like with a lot of games, but here i see real motivation for extract models from some games, so, i hope someone can help me with that, thanks.

Hello Joe 
I m find this tool to unpack MC LosAngeles game archive [http://tmacdev.com/2012/rpf-tool/](http://tmacdev.com/2012/rpf-tool/)
I have an interest to get the model from this game
Maybe we can ask to create a script to import 3d max?
