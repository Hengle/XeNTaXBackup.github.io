I have searched the disk and I found in the main of the disk is a file called DDS3.IMG coupled with a DDS3.DDT. (DDS3 meaning Digital Devil Story 3 I suppose).

It is 2.41GB and I believe it contains all the game data. There are multiple IRX files elsewhere and they seem to be locators for sound and such. Possibly.

I'm not sure if you have checked it already but at this point what should I provide you with? If it is possible? Any thoughts? It seems not to be compressed since I could read game text.

I'll provide the only other IMG file. It seems to contain ELF format files.

ELF is a form of executeable file and probably does
not contain any data (textures/sounds/models), so that file
would be pretty pointless too rip. the whole big datafile
would be neccesary, or you could cut it with the filecutter
and upload a slice of it =o

Good idea. I'll see what I can do. And I figured the ELF files did a type of function as executing somthing as they refer to files. I'll cut off a nice enough chunk. There.

Edit: How is this?

This files contains data i can see.
the front does have an ELF file in it, but the back cutted seems to have
VAG Audio in it (cannot be totally sure though as the header is missing),
so this file could definitely hold gamedata.

is this the large 1GB+ file you are speaking of?

Downloaded portions of the full Archive. it contains an textureformat
never seen before by me, and has a header that starts with "TXM0",
it could be read with rawreader in Photoshop. with some errors
though. the format is structured like 32bit but there seems to be something that im missing. hmmms......

The large one to me is most likely to contain all the textures, ingame voices, as well as the models.

Edit: Basically everything else other than probably conversation text, that is contained in the SLUS file so oftenly seen in PSX/PS2

Edit2: Also, If there is anything else I could do to help do tell.

Any probability of support? Not quite sure at this point. Sounds like it may use it's own format?

Ok, somthing I missed that may make this a whole lot easier. I found a data tree/index file that lists the content of the HUGE IMG file. It is called "DDS3.DDT" DDS I think stands for somthing along the lines of Digital Devil Story and 3 because it is the third Shin Megami Tensei. The index/data tree file seems to point out first folders then the files in each folder giving location values of each. Could it be possible to use this information instead of scanning the entire IMG archive or is it still required?

We'll see if the index/data tree file gives anything useful. In case it does would it be possible to have some way to first read the index and apply that to the data contained in the archive so it then can be read?

Edit: On second thought DDS3 may be the name of the PS2 engine as it is the same for Devil Summoner, a game of which I also got off eBay. XD What can I say? I love Megaten. This may also mean that Digital Devil Saga 1 and 2 are done the same way and thus could be viewed in a very similar fashion.

Sorry for this big bump but it seems that all PS2 Megaten games use this same system of DDS3.IMG (data) DDS3,DDT (what everything is named and where everything is)

Is it possible to read from primarily the index file where everything is or should I cut off a portion of the IMG file?

Yes, the IMG file, and then a DDT file to list off all the contents of it. HOWEVER Sound format is different between Devil Summoner and Nocturne. In DS you can rip all sounds with PSound.

Dunno if anyone's interested in this anymore or not, but some time ago I wrote an imperfect extractor for the DDT/IMG formats that can extract files from Nocturne, DDS1&2, Devil Summoner.

I was thinking to update it/made it perfect, but gave up on it from the lack of motivation.

This is the source code, compiled with VS2008

PS: By the way, on Nocturne's DVD, there's a Windows executable that opens up Atlus's TMX files (used in the games above plus Persona3 or more).

I think that code won't compile because it uses like 2 functions from my engine, but if you got some minor programming skills you can easily fix it. I might try to release an exe with an ini file if there's a big request to.

Last night, I felt a little bit motivated to work on it, and researched the .PB model format found in Nocturne/DDS1&2/Devil Summoner. Turns out they have around 10 textures/tmx-es stacked up in a single file, and I also found a trace of what seems to be normals and texcoords.

I have minor skills but they are in Visual Basic... so naturally I'm at the low end in programming. I analyze data, that is what I mainly do. I rip files and I enjoy making mods. I'd love to be able to view/convert models of those games in the future btw.  Maybe somebody here could help in the 3D field.

I don't have problems with 3D data since I'm currently a full-time game programmer 

I'm having more issues with motivation for doing this kind of stuff in my free time, because it's sometimes terribly boring to look over data that just doesn't seem to make any kind of sense.

Anyways, yesterday I worked a little bit more on .PB models and discovered that some files have wrong headers and direct the texture reading to other places than the real ones which is fuck weird because it screws up my processing. Next I discovered weird arrays of numbers right after the textures, like
1 0 -1 (72 bytes)
1 1 0  (72 bytes)
1 2 1  (72 bytes)
1 3 1  (72 bytes)
.......
1  89  88 (? bytes)
It's really weird because I know where they end, but don't know where the rest of the data begins (there's <=72 bytes, and any of them could start a new array of data). For the weird numbers, I think it's the skeletal bone tree(first number is ignored, second is child, and next it's parent) and right next to them there's 18 floats, which could mean a transformation matrix (since most values are near PI/2, 0 or 1), but some matrices sure look weird (like 1.2e-23) so I'm having some doubts.

PS:I think I'd rather make a new post for this stuff, so we won't bloat the current topic
