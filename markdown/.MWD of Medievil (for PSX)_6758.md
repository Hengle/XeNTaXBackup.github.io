I guess there is an index file somewhere because these archives look only as raw containers of files (like these 2GRV files) without informations about their offset/size/name.

it's also possible that the index table is in the executable.

Did you mean Medievil.exe file? 
I can upload this file if you want.

Is there any simple way to export/import files in this MWD archive?

Bump, I'd like to see the MWD unpacked.

Sorry to necrobump but it saves me the trouble of making a new post 

I don't have a normal copy of MediEvil on-hand but here's the EXE, MEDRES.MWD, and the file for Dan's Crypt for a version of MediEvil dated 1 month before release. Hopefully one of these should have a file index. It might also not have LIBCRYPT since it's dated a month early.

Resurrecting this thread from the dead

i have been trying very hard recently to export content from the MWD file and have come up with nothing, even using the BMS script it produces random files. 

The one thing i did notice is that there are 37 appearances of the word PP20 (50503230090A0C0D) in the file which tells me there is 37 powerpacker files in there. Also in the overlay files there are what appears to be names of model files at the start of the files as per below

Hex version 

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

@evlgsr, there was recently some progress in ripping on MediEvil Board:

Awesome stuff, wish they documented how it was figured out. See if we can figure something out from the python script.

Thanks for the link.

Just from a quick look at the MEDIEVIL.EXE - there are a bunch of tables beginning at approximately 0xC6B60 - each file entry is 32 bytes.

In the first table, the column that shows values such as 0x01, 0x3A, 0xBD, 0x138 - if you multiply those values by 0x800, you get the start offsets of the files in MEDRES.MWD (each file starts on an 0x800 byte boundary).  The next columns along to the right show, for example, 0x1C048 and 0x1C048 - these are the compressed and uncompressed file sizes (matching numbers mean file is not compressed).  Some file offset entries are blank, indicating no file.  Although I note that these blank entries still seem to have file size information present.

There are 13 of these tables, all separated by short chunks of data (maybe 0x120 bytes).  The final valid entry is 0x2FD1, which is offset 0x17E8800, with an uncompressed size of 0x47670 - this matches with the final file in the MEDRES.MWD archive.

I believe QuickBMS can do amiga_powerpacker decompression, so it should be possible to come up with a BMS script to read the file tables properly and extract/decompress the data.

Thanks for that great piece of info 

I am very curious how you picked that up, is there any tutorials that go in depth into compression types and how to pick them etc

All I did was look through the MEDRES file and I noticed that files seemed to start on a 0x800 byte boundary.  Many archives formats use this method and address the files using their block offsets.  So I could see, for example, that the first file was at 0x800 (block 1), the second at 0x1D000 (block 0x3A).  I could also see that the first file looked to be 0x1C048 bytes in size, so I just searched for that value in the .EXE file and found what looked like a file table.  In this table I noticed that the first couple of entries referred to blocks 0x01 and 0x3A, so I knew that must be the file table info.

File tables that have the length value twice usually indicates that some of the files are compressed - in this case, the compressed files have "PP20" in the header.  I Googled "PP20 file header" which suggested that it was a Powerpacker compressed file, although I couldn't get it to actually decompress using QuickBMS, so it might be modified somehow for this game.

Hopefully that should be enouugh information for somebody to be able to decompress those files.

I think that's more than enough info for now, thanks again.

For me I am just trying to work out what the best approach is when reverse engineering a file hence I picked this game not only to get the content but to learn along the way. 

Great forum with great people, keep it up.

I had a look at the exe file and could not find the table you refer to however the blocks were there in the mwd file and was able to unpack the last pp20 file, inside looks to be program code as there are strings that look like instructions.

Anywho maybe the exe you were looking at was the pc exe?

Thanks again

I was looking at the .EXE from the PS1 USA version.  The European release may have different files.

Hopefully you've got what you need

never mind found the table it actually starts closer to AD060 in the exe.

i went through a few files and it seems there is a combination of pp20, 2GRV, pBAV and unknown format files.

PP20 are no problem and can be unpacked using ccpacker program, i havent tried using quickbms yet.

still trying to figuer out what the 2GRV files are while the pBAV files appear to be sound files.
