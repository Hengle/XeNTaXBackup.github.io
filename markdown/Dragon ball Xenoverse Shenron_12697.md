- Post Title: Dragon ball Xenoverse Shenron

I've found how to extract characters from the game and import them into 3ds max, I have no idea however, on how to extract Shenron (not the character from the game but the dragon at which you make wishes). I can't even seem to locate the files. Anyone got any ideas or hints on the matter? Thanks in advance!!
