Hello i like models in Cryostasis Sleep Of Reason. 
But can't found tools or plugins for 3dsmax, i try for old games before Cryostasis but not works.

Did you ever create a maxscript?

Anyways this is one of the rare formats that use quads:

Thanks    but possible export other .cmf models too with textures and without bones only for 3dsmax with plugin or script?
There only one model for example.

I mean need script import models for 3dsmax or maybe tool convert models .cmf in obj.

There's only a handful of people in this forum who are writing scripts/tools for 3D models' extraction.
You'll have to wait until someone is interested/has time to do it for cmf models.

btw: you can use File/SaveAs mesh in hex2obj to create a wavefront obj file from the captain.
(As soon as you've done so I might have a glance into getting the uvs.)

Thanks   
Well i know need wait but with hex2obj hard for me convert other models .cmf and all models without textures.
I hope on help with .cmf models release tool for convert in obj.

Captain model was only for example, other models i try and can't export it hard do it.
