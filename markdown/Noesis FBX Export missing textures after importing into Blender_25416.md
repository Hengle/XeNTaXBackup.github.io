- Post Title: Noesis FBX Export missing textures after importing into Blender?

Hey guys,
I'm trying to export some models from the psp game Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha A's Portable: The Battle of Aces.
I can export the models and textures and everything with Noesis after decompressing with a few scripts, but now when I import the models as .fbx files in Blender they don't show up with any textures. In Noesis they do show up with textures. 

Anyone got any Idea why this happens and how to export with the textures applied to the model already? It's a pain to have to add them manually in Blender.

Thanks for any help!
