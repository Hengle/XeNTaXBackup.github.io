- Post Title: Aion Extract In-Game Character Meshes?

Is the character mesh for the model you create in-game (your avatar) stored somewhere in the game files? I know you can extract the base meshes and such, but is there a way to extract "your model"?

You can probably get the information needed to reconstruct your character with base parts from the Aion website character viewer (the 3d model viewer).

That is completely unpractical since you would have to dig through hundreds of game files and load them all one at a time into a viewer.

I've found a program called 3D Ripper DX that supposedly can pull out of 3D DirectX games. However, I'm having a problem using it with Aion. Has anyone else who's used it had any luck?

As awesome as 3d Ripper is- if you're using Windows Vista, then you're S.O.L...

Vista and 3d Ripper don't really get along...

hackshield detects 3d ripper as a hack so you need to do it with a private server that has an exe that bypasses hackshield
