Oooch,sorry   I forget about PES_Sound_File_Converter_1.5 - it's only from mp3\wav\adx to aix\adx\wav...
Your Aix have - frequency:48000,Channels:12
vgmstream - play aix\convert to wav  perfect...
aix2adx - convert aix to adx perfect(Drag and drop on exe and check in C:\Documents and Settings\Admin for Win Xp) - it will be 12 adx files.
