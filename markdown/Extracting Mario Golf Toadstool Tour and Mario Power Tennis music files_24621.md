Hi! How do I find the music files for Mario Golf: Toadstool Tour on the GameCube and convert them for use in Foobar2000? It's in a weird layout/filesystem where all the main folders are named A-D and the files and subfolders named A-Z (it's the same for Mario Power Tennis, but the Wii port is better in terms of folder structure). Any direction would be great, thanks!
