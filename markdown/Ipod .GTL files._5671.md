- Post Title: Ipod .GTL files.

I wish to extract the textures/graphics from these files.

Can anyone figure out how to do so?

Here is the precursor topic that may have some information. Though it's all script stuff so I wouldn't know.

Here, just to make things easier, I've uploaded the entire resources folder for the game. I think the ANI files work in conjunction with the GTL files.

I'd really appreciate help on this. I'm looking to extract the graphic files, mainly the enemies, so take a look at those first.

Upon closer inspection, it seems the ingame enemy files are GTL textures which, when boiled down, are just PVR textures in a collection I believe. I was hoping someone could help me figure out a proper way to view these?

I've come across PVR before, but I'm not sure these have the same specs. For example the game uses resizing and such for a lot of things, maybe they're some sort of vector format?

If they ARE vector files that could complicate things, unless it turns out they're flash files, heh heh.

Theres a good chance these .swf/flash files.

I want these files as well.  I looked at the resource files you posted, too.  Those are nice.

We just need a means of properly extracting them. Can some one please have a look at these? I really need the graphics.

I doubt these are Flash files, I didnt think Flash ran on the iPod/iPhone.

Then they must be some other form of vector format...either that or they're really big images.

I assume they're just really big images to start out with due to the fact they have visible resizing, but it's much smoother than most resize methods.

Looking at these in a hex editor reveals an underlying PVR format. I have a program that opens PVR but these GTL files do no open with it.

Incidentally PVR was a common format on the Sega Dreamcast. I doubt they would be the same though, but PVR files are common enough as an image format that there are programs for viewing them. So all we need to do is extract the PVR files and they'll be fully viewable.

No one seems to have taken interest...perhaps we should PM someone.

Apparently the PVR format is common to ipod touch games. This is another archive with an underlying PVR! format.

I don't mean to go too off topic here, but what program is that?

Any luck Loboto?

No, nothing yet. I was really hoping this would result in a quickbms script. I've run it through filestripper and jaeder naub with no results. These programs don't scan for PVRs.

Currently I'm on a shared computer so my home programs are not accessible to me. I'm sure if you just do a google search you'll find one somewhere.

EDIT: It's PVRTexTool. It's pretty cool, but you need a login to get it. Fortunately the registration is free.

Sweet, I've got it up and running now.  Thanks.

Looks like it's back to the drawing board, Loboto.

I've got the program now too.

Unfortunately I can't do scripting at all. I was hoping one of the many geniuses on this board would pop in and solve this with a quickbms script.

Someone, anyone, please help...

Yeah, it works wonders on the ipod PVRs as well as Dreamcast PVRs.

We have the tools, now just need the extractor!

This could be as simple as opening it in Tile Molester and searching for the right codec. I'll look into that now.

Unfortunately TM didn't work, neither did PVRTexTool, and neither did TexturePacker. I've tried everything I could think of but there's nothing more I can do...
