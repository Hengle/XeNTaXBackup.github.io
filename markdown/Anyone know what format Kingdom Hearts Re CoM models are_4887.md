Hey guys I was just curious, Kingdom Hearts 1 and 2 are all easily viewable thanks to yaz0r. But there doesn't seem to be much info on Kingdom Hearts Re: Chain of Memories. From what I can tell the models may be a different format but I'm not entirely sure. So far I haven't been able to dump anything from the disc. 

Does anyone have any knowledge about these models?

From viewing RAM dumps, they are in the .mdl format. They are hidden on the disc, you need a full version of iso buster to find them.

Well I know that KH1 was MDLS and KH2 was MDLX. So hopefully it turns out actually being one of those two. I'll look into this iso buster program thanks.
