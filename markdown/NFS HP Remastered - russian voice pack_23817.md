- Post Title: NFS HP Remastered - russian voice pack

Hello everyone.

The developers have disabled voice acting in the game in the 2020 remaster. In the 2010 game, the voice acting in russian worked.
I found out that in the remaster files there is a folder with the voice acting of RU, but in the game itself it is completely disabled. The developers were even too lazy to delete the files from the game itself.
Since February 2021, for 2 months I have been listening to over 4000 files and comparing English and Russian files, to replace the unique names of these files, and then replace them in the EN_US folder so that phrases in Russian are read out.
I analyzed everything that I could unpack with the ealayer 0.7.0 program, but files from the PB folder are not decoded into mp3. There is also a folder called FEEDBACKGROUPS, which contains files with the extension .BNDL.
By the method of deleting the PB folder, I realized that it was the files in it that needed to be decrypted and replaced with Russian ones.

Can anyone help in this? The ealayer program does not want to decrypt these files with the .sps extension.

Sorry for my english (google translate)
