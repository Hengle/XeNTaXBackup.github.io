Hi,all,i get some files from a game package,but i can't get the real format,so i hope someone can give me some help.
1.First type files are like 0302_UnPack,i think it may be some texture files but i can't sure.They have the head strings PPHD8.

2.And second type files are like 0D02_Pack,i think it may be a compress files,they all have the 00 05 on start.And it have many 38 70 symbols.

There are some simple files.
