I looked through the skeletal info:

Unfortunately the character model only had point clouds:

Now, I'm requesting a Noesis plugin to import BF2 character models/animations.

ok, using [bf wiki File Formats](https://bf2tech.uturista.pt/index.php/File_Formats) i create plugin for (*.skinnedmesh) and (*.bundledMesh).   
since I don't have the game and I don't know the folder structure then textures should be near the model.
(for the same reason, the skeleton is not loaded)
(can add a skeleton selection window for each model, but I'm already lazy)

(also with the help of the same wiki and these plugins, you can add support for all other formats.)

Do you care for *.baf (animations), and how do I import custom meshes/animations into the game?
