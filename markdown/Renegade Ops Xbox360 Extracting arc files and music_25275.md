- Post Title: Renegade Ops Xbox360: Extracting arc files and music?

I have been trying around to extract the music from the Xbox360 version of Renegade Ops since hcs64 only has the PC and PS3 which seem to have low quality MP3 audio.

So far I noticed that the archives seem to be quite similar to Just Cause and thats no wonder since its the same developer. I did have partly luck with that Just Cause 2 xbox360 endian extract script but it just puts out some random files including .CRID, .12 and such. Does anyone know what that is or is the script just not working properly?

Sadly nothing else had any effect yet and no extractor like Game Extractor or Dragon Unpacker can work with them. And in case you wonder, that Renegade Ops BMS script does NOT work on these files. Maybe it only works with another platform version but Xbox360 doesnt seem to work.

EDIT:
Nvm, I was just dumb. So the Just Cause 2 script does work on the Renegade Ops Xbox360 version and the music are in a handful of fsb files.
