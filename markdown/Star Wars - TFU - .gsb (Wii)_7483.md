LucasArts! 

Well, not at really them but the developers... They keep coming up with these strange formats that no one has heard of. Anyway, after trying to get my files from the Wii edition today I stumbled across .gsb files.

Help?

It's a standard dsp kind of container, but this is a short mono sfx; if the music is in the same format it is almost certainly interleaved, could you upload one of those (a larger file) so I can see how that's stored? 0x4 is probably the channel count but it's unclear where else in the header the interleave should go.

I believe the music files were .mus files... But I can double check that.

And here's the largest .gsb file:

EDIT: Yes. I was right, but here's a sample if it helps:
