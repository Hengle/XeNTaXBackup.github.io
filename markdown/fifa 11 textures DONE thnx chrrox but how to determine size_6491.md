When I endian swap I get the textures fine, then I add the DDS DXT1 header but
im not getting the image just right, how can I tell the actual size of the file?

Can you post the model tools here as for the textures just do a endian swap on the dds data and your all set.

unless this is what you are using.

yeah thats the converter im using but I'm not sure how to know which model is with which texture
how can I do an endian swap?, I've tried switching bytes but no luck so far

thanks

GOT IT working now the only question is how to determine the size of the DDS file so I can add the header?
