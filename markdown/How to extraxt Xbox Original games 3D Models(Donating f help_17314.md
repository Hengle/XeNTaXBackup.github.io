Ok so, xbox original games are basically .iso extensions. They can get extracted via XisoManager, the .xbe gets extracted and all the game data files that are inside the .iso. After the files get extracted in most of situations you get a lot of .bin files inside the archive which contain 3d models, textures, animations, etc.. 
my request is if someone could help me out, or try to explain to me how can i extract a .bin file from an xbox original video game. I would be really thankfull and i might donate if i get help on this one, thank you
