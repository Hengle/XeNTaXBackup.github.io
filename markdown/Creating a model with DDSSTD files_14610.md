- Post Title: Creating a model with DDS/STD files

Hopefully I'm not out of my element here.

I've unpacked an archive with QuickBMS for Zero Time Dilemma, and am just trying to recreate the models for the characters. I have a series of DDS files, which obviously look as expected. But I don't really understand what the STD files are, or how to combine them with their respective DDS files to create a full character and not just a squashed face. Here's an example of what I see at the end of the file:

```
useTexture......
effectfile......
k_AmbientScale..
.?..k_DiffuseSca
le...?..k_Fresne
lAmount...@..k_F
resnelRatioš™.?.
.k_FresnelScale.
..?..k_SpecAmoun
tÍÌÌ>..k_SpecPow
erš™™>..k_Specul
arScaleÍÌÌ=..nor
malMap......phon
gMaskMapÿÿÿÿ..st

```


So I know it's some sort of model/object information - I just don't know what to do with it exactly. Some basic searches turn up OpenOffice Draw as a program that can open it, but that doesn't seem to work. I can attach the files if need be.
