- Post Title: Idea for coder to extract Cyberflix/DreamFactory .TRK files

Since this might seem like the right place, Slikhedgehog, who has uploaded the score of Titanic: Adventure Out of Time on his channel ([https://www.youtube.com/user/Slikhedgehog](https://www.youtube.com/user/Slikhedgehog)), is one user I donâ€™t wish to see being overlooked or slipped from the hands of this site. From what I know, he made a code to extract the .TRK files of said game through some reverse engineering knowledge from former Cyberflix programmers who helped him with the formats. What we need now is to approach him, convince and offer him to share his programming methods and we may have a chance in successfully extracting at least the music, SFX and voices from Titanic and all the other Cyberflix games.

Do you think this could be possible?
