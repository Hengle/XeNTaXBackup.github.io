Hey guys, great site by the way.

For a few weeks now myself and guys over at the Deadrising2mods forum have been trying to find a way to convert the Case West and Case Zero XMA files.

This is what I managed to come up with. Big thanks to Alpha Twenty Three's XMA Transform script, Luigis QuickBMS and HCS's XMA_Parse and FFMPEG

It can convert entire folders of the XMA files to MP3, WAVE, WMA, OGG and FLAC

If its ok Id like to post a download link. I think this may be a bit easier and more streamlined than what I see people doing now for XMA conversion. I have only tested this with Case Zero and Case West XMA files

And for those unsure here it is chopping just shy of 1200 XMAs and converting to MP3 in under 4 and a half minutes

I believe the actual number was 1158 XMAs

XMA files should be playable by utilizing foobar2000 and the vgmstream component, both found here:
