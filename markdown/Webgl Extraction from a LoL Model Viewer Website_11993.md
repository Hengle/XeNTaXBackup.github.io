- Post Title: Webgl Extraction from a LoL Model Viewer Website

Hi, I've been searching around for a way to extract from this lol website so I can get a specific model. Why go to a website when you get the models from anywhere, you may ask?

Well, this site happens to have a model rendition of a character that you can't find anywhere and I wanna extract the model for share and custom use. I've seen people develop scripts to extract models from websites before on this site. Is it possible to make one to extract models from this specific site?
