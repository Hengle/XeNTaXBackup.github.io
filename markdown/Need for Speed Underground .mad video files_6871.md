VLC also opens it, but without the sound.

But it also has an option to convert video to mp4 via CTR+R.

Audio convert from .mad to .wav via this:
[http://www.ppmsite.com/forum/download.php?id=29526](http://www.ppmsite.com/forum/download.php?id=29526)

Just drag and drop movie to eaconv. It will create wav in movie folder.
