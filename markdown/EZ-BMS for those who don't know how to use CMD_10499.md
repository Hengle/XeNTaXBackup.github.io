EZ-BMS is less then 5MB and is portable. EZ-BMS will also recreate the folders in the EZ-BMS.exe destination if they aren't detected upon application exit.

If there is a feature missing that would improve this program please leave a comment, just know this tool isn't meant to take advantage of all quickbms commands, only a small few that is necessary for most applications.

Don't forget, all thanks to Luigi Auriemma [http://aluigi.altervista.org/quickbms.htm](http://aluigi.altervista.org/quickbms.htm)
