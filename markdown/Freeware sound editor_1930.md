Which is recommended, besides Audacity that is? I am looking for batch sound conversion and batch adding some effects like radio static noice to speech , clicks etc. May I add that word FREE could be preferably describing it too ?

[KISS](http://www.code-it.com/KISS_free_wave_editor.htm) looks excellent; it has many of the effects/filters that Sound Forge has.  [SoundEditor](http://www.freesoundeditor.com/incageneng.html?accueileng.html~main) has some effects/filters.  Look further to [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_audio_editor), drawing on the searching of others to help you find what you need.  For specialty stuff there's always SourceForge, but a lot of that specialty stuff will be Linux-only, though.
