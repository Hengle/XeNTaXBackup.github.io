- Post Title: Medievil (PS4) any news?

It is mostly if anyone had the chance to play with the data or if they've try it.
I haven't see the pkg in the most illegal way, so it gives the idea that nobody is interested.

So, had any give a shot? Mostly for know what I will be upon if I ever got the data of the game.
