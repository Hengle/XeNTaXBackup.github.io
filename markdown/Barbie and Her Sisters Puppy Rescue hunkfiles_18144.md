I know this is kind of a pointless request, but thought I'd ask if this archive format can be easily reverse-engineered or something. It appears to have two parts, one .files file containing some metadata for the archives, and the archives themselves.

Here's a link to the samples I took from the game:

Structure seems simple enough then. But what about the archives themselves?

You want to fully reverse engineering the file structure? That would require much more time than simply extracting the meshes.

Ideally yes, assuming one would mod the game for the heck of it. But in my case just extracting things like meshes or textures would be fine I guess.

Not to mention that I'd like to rip the cars from it as well.
