- Post Title: The Greatest Tip Comment your scripts, templates and code

Guys I hope I am not coming off as an idiot but please please please comment more
I can assure you that noobs like me will ask less questions if you use comments

Sometimes it reads like assembly or bytecode especially when variables have strange names

This would allow the community to build off from where our predecessors stop

Thank you all
