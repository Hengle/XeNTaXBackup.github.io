All game content is in .ttarch files.
I would upload a sample but I guess that is against the new rules.
Would be nice have them unpacked.

There is an quickbms script for Telletale Games but it doesn't work. I get an error when I apply it on the archives.

The same with the ttarchext.exe and Telltale Explorer.

Upload some file and send it to Aluigi via PM.
He knows how to deal with Telltale games.

You must :
- get TTG Tools (i'm using the Debug.rar version from the author, downloaded somewhere in the forum).
- get the last version of ttarchext from the author Luigi.
- get the game files .ttarch

With ttarchext, I extract all files from each archive. Ex :
C:\ttarchext>ttarchext.exe -k 96CA999F8DDA9A87D7CDD9956295AAB8D59596E5A4B99BD0C9
529F8590CDCD9FC8B39993C6C49D9DA5A4CFCDA39DBBDDACA78B94D4A36F 0_98_patch.ttarch *myOutputFolder*

I translate .landb files to .txt files with TTG Tools.
I translate my language file.
I translate .txt file to .landb file.
I update my new file in the package extracted (with all original others files)

With ttarchext, I rebuild my .ttarch with ttarchext. Ex :
C:\ttarchext>ttarchext -b -x -V 8 52 C:\ttarchext\TWD_Final\0_98_patch.ttarch C:\ttarchext\*myOutputFolder*

I replace my archive into my game folder and launch the game. Enjoy !

The header of these .font files is changed, it's longer than in previous games from Telltale.
And there aren't TGAs, but DDSs (it really doesn't matter, just saying)

Unpack 0_98_patch.ttarch, you will find newer ui_menu_english.landb with that missing string.
Also look at 0_99_patch.ttarch

 What is the file responsible for it?

Unpack 0_98_patch.ttarch, you will find newer ui_menu_english.landb with that missing string.
Also look at 0_99_patch.ttarch  

thanks man, helped me a lot!
Thank you so!

sylar, are you trying to translate to spanish?

Ehm, guys, command prompt doesn't like spaces in the path. That's the problem. 
So remove them or use quotes, like this:

```
ttarchext -x -b -V 8 52 "C:\Some Path With Spaces\blah.ttarch" "C:\The Walking Dead Tools\TTG Tools\Input"
```

Hi!

I'm trying to translate the game, but when I want to encrypt .txt to .landb the soft (TTG Tools) doesn't work. I've already written this in the config file:

C:\The Walking Dead Tools\TTG Tools\Input
C:\The Walking Dead Tools\TTG Tools\Output
C:\The Walking Dead Tools\TTG Tools\temp
C:\The Walking Dead Tools\ttarchext\ttarchext.exe

Could anyone help me, please? Thanks  !

Input folder must contain .landb and translated .txt files. Encrypt them and new .landb files will be saved into Output folder.

Why do you modify 2_WalkingDead101_english_pc_data.ttarch? Put your new files to a brand new .ttarch and name it 0.ttarch.

I also put the original .landb files in the Input folder but when I try to encrypt the program stops running and forces me to close it.

Tool crashes when your .txt differs from .landb. Try encrypt them one by one and you will find which file is wrong (I had this problem with ui_menu_english.txt file).

Forget on 2_WalkingDead101_english_pc_data.ttarch, forget on 919 kb. That's not important. Do what I wrote before. Make a BRAND NEW .ttarch file. Do NOT try to modify 2_WalkingDead101_english_pc_data.ttarch. 

My game runs fine.

The mine also has errors when I send encrypted, forcing the closing of the program.
Does anyone know why this happens? 4 and is more files that are thus in the rest are good.


And could someone please teach me how can I add a font to use letters with (é, ã, í ô, etc..) thanks in advance.

Well it's my solution. You should take the old font (which you can edit with TTG Tool), and new font (from TWD) to compare them in hex-editor.
[](http://fastpic.ru/view/37/2012/0508/5a0ac0c28ab1871c36bdc7d4920d79a3.jpg.html)
You need to copy these different bytes from old font to new (TWD) font. And then you can edit this font with TTG Tool. But don't forget to copy the bytes back when you'll finish edit your own font.

hello. try to translate TWD for x360. I use this command to create a ttarch file
ttarchext -x -b -V 8 52 "C:\Some Path With Spaces\blah.ttarch" "C:\The Walking Dead Tools\TTG Tools\Input"

Everything seems ok. But when i launch the game it's cause a fatal crash.
the infos about original file:

```
- set the blowfish key of "Walking Dead: A New Day"
- version    9
- info_mode  0
- type3      4
- files_mode 2
- found 211 compressed chunks
- set chunk size to 0x10000 bytes
- info_table has a size of 76253 bytes
- set files base offset 0x00005e43
- filesystem compression: on
- filesystem encryption:  off
- retrieve folders:
  c:\program files\telltale games\telltale tool\t3\working\2_wd101_english_xbox_
data_mem\
  c:\telltale\projects\walkingdead101\gamedata\c:\program files\telltale games\t
elltale tool\t3\working\xbox\

```


Should I do modify something in command line to run the game with a rebuilded ttarch?

Hello everyone. I have a couple of questions.
I've learned how to extract files from *.ttarch archives, landb->txt & txt->lanb and create new ttarch, thanks for this guys, now i can do this.  
1. I have translated txt files via notepad, but in game i don't see my language, i've see only some weird symbols and signs, i guess, it's because game font doesn't support my language, yes?
2. How to edit *.font files? When i open *.font file via Font Editor (TTG Tool) i get an error: "Error! Maybe you forget decrypt font?"  
    - HxD didn't help. Maybe i've done something wrong? 
3. I don't know maybe it's stupid question, but... via which program do you guys edit text? Simple via notepad or, maybe, ms office, wordpad, and ect? I'm asking because of  text encoding, especially in ms office. This is important? Somehow affects the editing? 

Thanks for your attention, and i hope, that someone will help me. PEACE!

I did it

[](http://www.hostingpics.net/viewer.php?id=317686Sanstitre.jpg)

But when i open the font with TTG Tool , I have a error. 

This seems normal, on another topic they say it. We can only export to DDS for modification.

I tried to translate WDG for ios. but iphone can't recognize ttarch file

I changed one of the landb file, and rebuild to ttarch file,   naming 0_97_patch.ttarch, and put it in default folder.

In pc ver, this attempt has effect,  but in ios ver, it doesn't work. the game did't run

I tried this command. (same as pc ver)

 ttarchext.exe -m 52 

 ttarchext.exe -b -x -V 8 52 

is anything wrong with this? plz help me

I highly doubt that the iOS and PC version are identical in any way. It will use a diffrent file format.
iOS games always use specialized formats that you don't find on ports on another OS.

In fact, the format is the same.

I think that problem will be somewhere else, not in ttarch file. Maybe in _CodeSignature/CodeResources file (just guessing, I have no Apple product).

Does Ü Ö Ä work in the langdb files?
When I "convert" the langdb files into .txt and translate the files with letters Ä Ö Ü.
Will it work finally in the game?

I would like to replace the "sound files". I got the sounds in WAV or OGG. I want replace them,
but they are in a .fsb fromat. How can i convert WAV, OGG or whatever to .fsb?

Anybody knows how to change the way the subtitles appear?
They appear slowly from left to right, word by word.
Is there anyway I can make them just pop up, whole line at once?

See I'm translating to Arabic. and Arabic goes from right to left...so when the subtitles appear the end of sentence appears first then goes on till it gets to the beginning of the sentence.

I think its coded in the game.
With ttarch files you can just change files like subtitles, fonts, textures, 3d models (its still a unknown format), sound 
something like this.

I hope you can understand me.

thanks it worked!

Now I have created own voice sounds and in the right .fsb format.
I created a ttarch of one voice sound (named with the right ID) but in the game nothing has changed!

Can someone please help me?!

Hm yeah.
I tested it with one sentence from a character but that doesn't work.

I changed the sentence "previously on the walking dead". That worked. 
But after that the voice of the charakters are not there.

If you have freeboot you don't need create new ttarch, just put landb files in one folder with ttarch.

What season you try to translate? For first season this method certainly works. For example this folder structures in russian translate xbox version 
[](http://youpic.su/view.php?id=s001.youpic.su/pictures/1388523600/0f0479d25d23d9dd2ed4192e04c5dce2.png)

And it's working

If you say about second season maybe they changed something, but i don't think so, because for ps3 this method actually works for second season too.
