- Post Title: Extract or Open Nancy Drew PC Ciftree.Dat files

Hi. I was told to post this here but I am trying to extract Ciftree.Dat files from the older Nancy Drew PC games. This one is from The Final Scene. The tools i found online don't support them. Hex editing isn't an option for me as I have no clue how to do it properly. Any ideas?
