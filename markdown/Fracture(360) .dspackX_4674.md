the files you uploaded do not give me a good indication of the file structure because i am not familiar with the games cache files but running this command will extract the files.
they seem to be in 32k chunks at least in one file.
c:\offzip.exe -z -a -15 c:\file.dspackx c:\extract 0x0
so that will get you uncompressed file sections.

note that it uses a temporary file so (as suggested by the message of the script) type "a" (stands for "all") to skip the overwrite confirmations.
I have opted for the temporary file because I don't know how much big are the other archives and to avoid problems with low amounts of memory
