- Post Title: [Switch] Shin Megami Tensei V - pak file

I am attempting to unpack the .pak file for Shin Megami Tensei V, which is made in Unreal Engine 4.23. Attempting to use the Unreal Tournament 4 script results in the error "the requested amount of bytes to allocate is negative", regardless of whether I input the correct decryption key or not. (At least, I assume I'm using the correct key: 0x5B23532568E0C4E82F4ABC7B22BCAC3599006FD106D9CD8AACD1BD4393FFDC61).

Since I dumped the .pak onto my Switch's SD card, I had to split it into an archive of 3 files (the full .pak is 8.2GB, which exceeds the file size limit for FAT32). I don't know if this might be causing the problem.
