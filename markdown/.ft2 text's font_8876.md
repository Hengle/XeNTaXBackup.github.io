- Post Title: .ft2 text's font

Hi! I'm working over an Android/IOS game. I've succesfully dump scripts, inserted it and recalculated pointers without any problem.

The main problem are game text fonts. They are in .FT2 format, and I've not found way to edit them. I've found some info [here](http://www.freetype.org/freetype2/index.html), but I'm not sure if it's the same.

Here they are if anyone of you want to take a look: [http://www.box.com/s/94f14cca75c300fa1789](http://www.box.com/s/94f14cca75c300fa1789)

Thanks!!!
