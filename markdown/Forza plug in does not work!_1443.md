- Post Title: Forza plug in does not work!

Hi

I have the registered version of Multihex. I got it only to unpack cab and ca2 filed for Forza motorpsort on xbox. Multihex has got support for this game. But when I try to unpack a cab file, some ini files are accessible, some are not? there is an error message saying that the file is unreadable. I think the support for the game is uncomplete. I posted in the appropriate forum but no reply. Can someone have a look please? there is a link to a cab file in the forum.

Regards

Hmm, you already posted this once? 

Anyway, I'm a bit busy at the moment, but your problem is noted. 
I will see if I can find that .CAB file of yours and test it.

Sorry to dregd up an old topis.. but I figured why not use one that's already there.

Took one look at your utility last nite and paid the $6 a minute later - what a great tool.

Excellent work!

Now on to my quesitin - the Forza plugin works great and unpacks everything.  What would you recommend I use to extract the .dds I know is buried in the XPR files?

Thanks in advance guys, and I feel guilty only sending you $6 for the effort... 

Mind if I send you another $4 to make it an even $10??

Well, XPR files should also be extracted using a MexCom script, I believe. 

And sure, why not make it an even $10?  All support is most welcome.
