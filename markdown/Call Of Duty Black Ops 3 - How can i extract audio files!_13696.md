Hi, someone could write a dumper/extractor which will be able to unpack/extract (.sabl/.sabs) audio files from CoD Black ops 3?
Thank You!

I'd like to second the want for this. [This tool](https://www.itsmods.com/forum/Thread-Release-Black-Ops-II-III-Sound-Studio-1-5-2.html) does a good job of being able to access and extract the files, the only catch is that only some of the files have their original file names and directory structure. I'm looking to mux the audio from the extracted sabs/sabl files back into the video files to make files I can play back with sound. Without the original file names it's difficult, even near impossible to do.
