- Post Title: Opening .CPK files from SD Gundam G Generation World

Been working on a translation project for a few months now but I need some help. 
90% of the data is stored in CPK files which don't have a TOC. So whenever I extract the files out I get about 13,000 no-extension files. I some how managed to get them out and named properly with their proper extensions but I can't figure out how. If anyone could help a bro out that'd be super appreciated. (Yes I've tried UTF_TAB special and the CriFileMaker and the QuickBMS scripts)
