- Post Title: Exist Archive [PS Vita] - .asf/apk/aif files

Hi, I've been looking into the Exist Archive [Vita] character models, I managed to extract the main cpk file and found the model files, but I can't unpackage them into something useable. I tried the Star Ocean Anemesis tool on the site, but that doesn't work. I'm not familiar with doing this kind of stuff myself and was wondering if anyone has any knowledge to help.
I'll post some pics of the file headers and such as well as some files themselves. Any help will be appreciated!

Since I can't post the stuff here directly, I'll toss the link if that's ok. The pictures are screenshots of the headers etc if you want to just look at those, the zip is one set of the files I'm trying to work with.

Indices are compressed. Same stuff as Star Ocean Anamnesis.

I was planning to support this game at some point, but models are not that good. Maybe if I get bored enough some day
