Hello everybody!

I'm new here & need some help
There are 3 games of "Tales of" series for Playtation One. Currently I'm planning to translate them from English to Russian. I know PSX is kinda dead platform but it does not matter for me    Some information of this games is stored in strange files like data.bin, movie.bin etc. This files are some kind of archives (looks like text is coded in some files with lzss method). Here is example of data.bin (from Tales Of Phantasia PSX - it stores game script and possibly sprites also):
