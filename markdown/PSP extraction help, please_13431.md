- Post Title: PSP extraction help, please?

I have two PlayStation Portable games I'd like to extract from, and I'm having 2 different issues. 

1 - One game (Warriors Orochi 2) is full of Linkdata files with .bns .cns .dns .ens extensions, instead of .bin files. How do I unpack these, please?

2 - The other (Warriors Orochi 2 - Special) has bin files (yay) and I was able to get the models, but I can't find the .gim textures anywhere. 
So in Noesis the .gmo models show up white, but they all have assigned textures I cant seem to locate in either of the Linkdata files. 

Both GitMo and TextER said it didn't detect anything. 
I followed the tutorial here: [https://facepunch.com/showthread.php?t=913469](https://facepunch.com/showthread.php?t=913469)

Any help would be appreciated.

Not the text, the textures. The materials, that I can convert to .png or .dds or .bmp form.
