- Post Title: Diablo 3 apply texture on model properly

Hi there,

I hope you guys can help me out.

I found this awesome thread here ( [viewtopic.php?f=16&t=7337&start=150](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=7337&start=150) ) and managed to get the models and textures out of the mpq-files. I use the scripts from TaylorMouse (thanks a lot) in 3ds Max to get the models. And to get the textures I use the "D3TexConv"-converter.

My problem is now to put the textures on the models so it looks as it was meant to. I tried it with the monk. I applied the texture "Monk_F_NKD_Norm_Base_A_diff.dds" with no problem (drag and drop onto model, nothing more). But if I try to apply some of the other textures like "Monk_F_HVY_Hell_Base_A_01_diff.dds" it looks way off (face is on the waist : / )

How is a texture beeing applied to such model? How is the logic behind this?
How can I change it so it looks good? Do I do something wrong? (I actually have no clue what I'm doing inside 3ds Max : / Played around with the material editor but ... yhea)
