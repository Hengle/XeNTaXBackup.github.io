In addition to FMV, the EA audio chunk types are frequently used throughout Electronic Arts games for music tracks, audio effects and speech. Older titles use the .ASF file extension for individual music tracks, whereas newer titles store multiple audio sequentially within the one file (hence rational for the ending chunk types) and use a variety of file extensions. wow man i am dying to play it..
