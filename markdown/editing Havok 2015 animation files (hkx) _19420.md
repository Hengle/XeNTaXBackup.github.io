- Post Title: editing Havok 2015 animation files (hkx) ?

I’m big into the Dark Souls modding scene. Most of the games use Havok 2014 or earlier, which is great because we can edit those animations. But the newest one — Dark Souls Remastered — uses Havok 2015, for which there aren’t any publicly-available tools. Does anyone have any methods/tools/scripts/etc. to get Havok 2015 animations into an editable format (and back)?

P.S. We have a discord server for modding Dark Souls: [https://discord.gg/mT2JJjx](https://discord.gg/mT2JJjx)

Sorry, you're out of luck. Havok is notorious for being highly obscure and customizable, that means for every slight format change a brand-new tool has to be written, and there's nobody here who's interested in the engine.
