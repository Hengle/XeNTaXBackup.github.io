- Post Title: Forza Horizon 4 camera settings

Hi there! I don't know if I posted in the corect topic but anyway...

Does anyone know how to increase field of view(FOV) in Forza Horizon 4 for pc? 55 degress is not that impresive.
I was trying to unzip an archive, named"Camera", inside game folder but i was unsuccessful. There are some files there which can be modify.
Can anyone make a tutorial or give me some advice how to extract/operate inside this archive?
To be clear, I want to use this for my own fun! Not trying to make money or things like this. 

Thank you!
