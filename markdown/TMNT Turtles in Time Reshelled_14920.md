- Post Title: TMNT Turtles in Time Reshelled

Hey guys, I'm hoping someone (probably the patron saint of all things QUICKBMS Luigi  ) might be able to take a look at this .bf file. I've tried using the various scripts out there, and even the bf extractor that was posted on here a while back, but none have worked -- the Michael Jackson one extracted SOME files, but crashed out, so I guess that's the closest so far. Anyway, here's the sample bf if anyone cares to check for me. Quite a few cool oldschool TMNT models I'd love to play around with in this...

I think it was either BFExtractor, or the Tintin.bms script.
