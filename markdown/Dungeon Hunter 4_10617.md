There are 2 types here.
the original files are zip files. and the bdae files are also zip files that contain models and texture info in text and binary dae format.
dae files are a pain to parse so someone will have to do that if they want to convert these models correctly.
Extract this sample zip model then extract the bdae as a zip file also then you will see the structure.

I am guessing he just manually imported one of the buffers from the buffer file.

When I saw the model I somewhat lost interest because of the low poly appearance.

(As the thread starter did - maybe.)

Hi,

I don't really understand about the original file is zip file.
in DH4, the files are file00????.dat. And those files are not recognized as archive file even by 7Zip, even after I have renamed to .zip.

What do I need to do before to get the archived file?

Thanks

Yea that's what I found. The game seems completely dependent on an online server and that no longer exists so upgrading anything doesn't work. It's sad that they didn't make the game completely offline before abandoning it
