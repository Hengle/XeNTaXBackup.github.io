- Post Title: Okami

I was wondering if anyone here knows anything about the Okami data files, and if possible knew how to read/understand them. I'm currently working with .AKT files which are told (by one source) to be collision data. I'm trying to use these files to understand how the game creates collision and how to read where collision is in general.
