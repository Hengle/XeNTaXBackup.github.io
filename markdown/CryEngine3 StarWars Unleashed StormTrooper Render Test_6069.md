Can you make your own Materials? That alone can determine (for many people) if their work is really cut out for them.

I created this custom material for the StormTrooper, it looks really good. The material editor is FAR easier than UDK.. And it looks amazing. So yeah creating your own materials with particles or other effects is very easy now.

Discussing leaked Crysis 2 material is NOT allowed.
