- Post Title: l32 / l64 to lua

Hello everyone, I am modder on Farming Simulator and I will need help.

I have here 2 files in extensions l32 and l64. The game reads them in a single lua file. How can I make it possible to assemble the 2 files?

For information, as soon as I open an l32 or l64 file with a text editor, it is not LUA.

Thank you very much for your help

Hello, sorry for my late reply. Where can I find modded version of a Lua decompiler to work with LuaJit and be sure that is the right version.

Thanks you !
