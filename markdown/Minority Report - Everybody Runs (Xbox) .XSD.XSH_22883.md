Hi guys, I'll be very grateful if you help me unpacking [these archives](https://mega.nz/file/1FVmGZ7T#UZHAQPk5zGN4g39P1DwMvD1zLqts63E7O3SviavMUpA).

I'm not sure if that *.txt or *.bin file are of any use but I included them nonetheless.

Thanks in advance & good luck with this type of archive!
Bye!

Hello. I was able to extract some data from your samples [https://imgur.com/a/DTYfVdL](https://imgur.com/a/DTYfVdL)

I have also documented this format here

Thanks!

Alas, the only downside is that actual music tracks aren't in those *.XSD files (it was insane to suspect otherwise but still, the hope dies last I guess).
BGMs are apparently in a huge STREAMS.XSS archive which is very likely a concatenated bunch of headerless ADPCM streams... I'd post it and kindly ask you to look & see if you can extract it somehow, would you mind?
I'm not sure it's going to be possible to get those music tracks with their proper names (like mx_sb1_jk_intro or mx_apossibly_instrumental) but I'm fine as long as I'm able to play those. I managed to play back *.bin from *.XSD without any nuisance so it's not probable I'll run into much trouble with BGM (it's got to be the same codec but presumably stereo), the single problem ATM is properly unpacking STREAMS.XSS.

Let me know if you want to inspect that huge archive I was talking about. I suppose a cut from the file would be needed, this STREAMS.XSS is a 416 ÐœB giant!
so long!

Yeah, you can upload archive file to MEGA, google drive etc. if you want.

I have checked your XSS file, but I couldn't extract it. There are no offsets or sizes in this file or at least I can't find them.
Also, no PCM or ADPCM player that I have, was not able to play any music.
