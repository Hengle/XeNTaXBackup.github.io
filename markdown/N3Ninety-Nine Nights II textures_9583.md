Hello everyone! 
I need help with Xbox-360 Ninety-Nine Nights II textures, they have .dds extension, but they aren't  true .dds and are compressed. I don't know how to extract and convert  them to normal .dds. Here is a sample files [http://www.mediafire.com/?2xn3ic4b9jbnxg8](http://www.mediafire.com/?2xn3ic4b9jbnxg8) Thanks in advance!

To me it looks like the XPR2 format just adjusted.

Thank you for the tip C00L12345! Any idea how to convert them into .tga or .dds?

I've tried some tools for XPR2 format, they didn't work for me. It seems each .dds file from N3-2 has few textures inside (color,normal etc.).
