Hi alessillo, did you buy the full version of this game?  Is it worth $125?

Any progress on working with the models?

Cheers,

S

Yes I bought the game in 2008 (120 $) and the new update 2.538 (30 $) one month ago; if you are a fan of tank simulation you must have it, the game is great, the level of realism is unmatched. The only limit, and this is the reason why I'm looking for help here, it's the absence of support for mods, you can't add vehicles, buildings, etc.
Unfortunately at the moment I made no progress.

Cheers
