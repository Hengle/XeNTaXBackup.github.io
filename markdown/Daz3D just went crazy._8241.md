LOL
The offer is open till 14th - according to when the download link runs out.
Dunno if that's before 14th.

Wanted hexagon2 for ages, now I got it, it's a bit crap. IMO.
Metasequoia is better than hexagon2.

Metaseq is great. Got me into 3D with its simplistic (and limited) format. It also makes it easy to create/edit models and has very simple learning curve.

Now, does your documents include the animation plugin?

Like the format itself, not how to use it.

And I just got myself a copy of some free software

Yeah, I dled those programs too after seeing them on the boob-raider forums. You can never get enough free and legal software . Be sure to dl some of the free models and learning packs too. This means they are probably coming out with a new version and are desperate for new customers!

No keynote doesn't need docs, download samples and look at them. 
I'm sure there is a basic tut for it out there, can't surf much to look for it, my mouse died.

Hmm, I guess I can spend more than 5 mins looking at it.

Guess a ball mouse.

Not ball mouse, keep wearing the cable out!!!
If you look in the plugin 'boneplug' directory there are samples for keynote, there's also a make_anc.dll that should go in the create folder (seem to need triangles only or it won't work, like the vacum plugin).
Found an english version of the plugin, let you google that yourself.
