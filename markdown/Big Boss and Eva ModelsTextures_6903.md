Hello Xentax mates,
I have been looking for these two models forever and am wondering if anyone has leads? I apologize if this has been asked before since I am new to this forum. However, if anyone does have something, please please please send me information and such. All is appreciated. Thanks!

If you wanna go hardcore, you could find more leads with an image host search and TinEye's Reverse Image search.
But no one has managed to convert models from MGS3 as far as I know.

Oh yeah. I saw a bit of information about the models on the PS23DFormat wiki, but I didn't know it went any further than that... Unless I've severly forgotten something.

would anyone know how to use textures to create models from scratch? possibly without the need for extraction. it appears extracting from mgs3 is just impossibly impossible=/

The textures would be of great interest to me. If you could get permission I'd love access to them 

Edit: I'm afraid it does not work like that blebleble92, the 3d mesh is created and then unwrapped, which simply means the contours of the 3d mesh are mapped out in 2D space. The textures will only clue us into the art style and uv layout they used, not the topology of the mesh.
