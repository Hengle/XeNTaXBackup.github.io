- Post Title: Idea: Soundbite+Screenshot combo

Hi, 

Few years back I had the idea to combine a game screenshot with the window of sound that surrounds it. So in essence, once you press a key to make a screenshot, it will automatically save the 3 seconds of sound before and after it. The medium is then displayed with sound. Like a screenshot with the sound that was audible at the time right before and after the instance. 

What do you think? I implemented it in a crude way using bass.dll to monitor the sound, with a VB plugin, but I'm sure you can do better. Also, it would need to be saved in a standardized file format so other media players can display+play it. 

Interesting? Why not make it a project to finish?

That's actually a really good idea. maybe make a way to easily share the result online and you'd have a great little fun toy. if you implemented a web uploader, people could upload them as little memories of their gaming experiences.  There were a few android/ios apps that tried to do this with photos, but never caught on. probably because other users needed the same specific app to send and recieve those pictures and the audio clip that went with it. Making a web backend that uses standard plugins or html5 would make it far more accessable for others to view and be inspired by the content.
