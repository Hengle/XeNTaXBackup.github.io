I have some *.ibg files that I would like to convert. However, I don't know how to convert them! Can someone give me an easy-to-understand tutorial? And I would like to be able to open them up on Metasequoia.

His was for the PS3 version.
Apparently the PSP version has more costumes.

has way more costumes... millions O_O!!

I had another look at the format, and my structures look more like structures.. but still got stuck on the same stupid area.. seems each vertex section has this huge header like area above it consisting of FF's and 00's of variable size.

I was gonna try to scan for valid vertex data and import it that way.. but then I was having problems forming correct faces.. theres a big part of the IGB format that I'm not understanding

Seems this guy has cracked the IGB format, but not interested in sharing any information sadly

Wow, I wasn't sure just what you meant by "millions" of costumes but the video made it pretty clear lol

You asked him for info already and he refused? Maybe along the lines of "I did it all by my self"?
