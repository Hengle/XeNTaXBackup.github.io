- Post Title: Nioh Model Extraction!!

I was wondering if someone could point me in the right direction of where I could find something to extract the models from the .bin files from the extracted .dat files from nioh after using QuickBMS. I have been searching but haven't found that many people have modded / extracted the contents from Nioh.
