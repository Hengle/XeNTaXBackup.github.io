Hi, I've made a tool called "wwiser" that reads Wwise's .bnk files and shows/prints their contents: [wwiser releases](https://github.com/bnnm/wwiser/releases) (needs python3 installed).

It's mainly geared towards audio playback with [vgmstream](https://github.com/losnoco/vgmstream/releases) (also [rip guide](https://hcs64.com/mboard/forum.php?showthread=61770)), but I thought some people here would be interested in exploring those banks. It reads *all* bnk chunks, including HIRC info (actual scripting data in Wwise), and prints all fields properly named.

Usage should be easy enough (has a simple GUI) but see [README](https://github.com/bnnm/wwiser/blob/master/README.md). Should work with every .bnk save the first two versions (Too Human and Shadowrun).

Note that tool doesn't and will never modify .bnk, nor does extract files

Thank you so much for this, I was about to go insane trying to reverse the HIRC formats.
