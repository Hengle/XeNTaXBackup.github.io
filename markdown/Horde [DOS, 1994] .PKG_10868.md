- Post Title: Horde [DOS, 1994] .PKG

This archive is two variants - all-in-one HORDE.PKG in CD version and separate .PKGs in floppy and demo versions.

Archive doesn't have header, first data is file/offset table, I think.

Looking unpacker\bms script.

Demo of the game - [https://anonfiles.com/file/dda0ae0b9d2a ... a4f9e035b8](https://anonfiles.com/file/dda0ae0b9d2ac0a1273e10a4f9e035b8)
