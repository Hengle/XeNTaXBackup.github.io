I tried the 3D Object Converter but I got corrupt faces. Can anyone fix the vehicle mesh problem?

I completely rewrote my Insane .fff loader module I made 20 years ago based on the sample files I got from other users.

I have released the following program:
- 3D Object Converter v10.010 (Windows)

How to get the 3D Object Converter v10.010:
Download the 3D Object Converter from [ http://3doc.i3dconverter.com](http://3doc.i3dconverter.com) and install it or download and use the portable version (if you don’t have it yet).
(Or just use the Help/Check for updates... function to get the v10.010.)
