- Post Title: Resident Evil Outbreak room model ectraction problem

So I can extract the .nbd files with NBDX to give me the .OBJ file, NPCs and enemies come out fine, but the rooms and scenes are really messed up, It looks like all the parts are centered and have an inconsistent scale.


Im not concerned about the textures, but I'd like to get the scenes out intact. Has anyone done this or know what the issue is?
