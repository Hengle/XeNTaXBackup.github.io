- Post Title: Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix's .BIG

Hey folks! 
I've scanned this forum (and a few others) trying to figure out how to extract meshes, textures & sounds out of the HP .BIG archives, but no results so far. The .BIG archives mostly contain formats like .SDT, which is what I assume to be a sound format, and .STR, which is what I assume to be a mesh format, but not a single place on the internet tells me what I can extract from them, and how it's done. 

I really hope you guys can help me! 
P.S. 
A legal demo is available here: [http://bit.ly/HP5DEMO](http://bit.ly/HP5DEMO), in case you don't have the game. Other alternatives are either the previous game in the series, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, which uses the same packing system (or so it seems). The same applies on the next game in the series, which I think uses the EXACT same method of packing.

Thanks! Works like a charm!
Right now I'm trying to figure out how to extract models and textures out of the FFS, STR & SDT files. Do you happen to know how I can do that?

-edit-
It turns out all of the formats are created by this program called FME viewer, which is used to encrypt (and hopefully decode) archives. I'll post the results as soon as I try it.
