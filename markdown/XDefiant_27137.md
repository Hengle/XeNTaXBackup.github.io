I am pretty new to datamining, I would use a tool called Fmodel to datamine games such as Fortnite and Valorant but XDefiant is a new FPS game by Ubisoft that uses the snowdrop engine and I would like to be a reliable leaker for the game, how would I go about it?

you could possibly use division2extract but you may need to update its code due to possible extra data on the sdftoc files, and dump the games exe to retreive the aes and iv key wich isnt easy with easy anti cheat

No, still waiting for the game to release to try out these methods.
