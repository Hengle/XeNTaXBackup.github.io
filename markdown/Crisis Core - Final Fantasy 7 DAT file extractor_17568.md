- Post Title: Crisis Core - Final Fantasy 7 DAT file extractor

Hi and hello there,
i wonder if anyone knows a way to get the image files extracted from the dat files which i could unpack with the "Crisis core final fantasy 7 discimg.pkg tool" found on this forums.
I googled alot and didnt found anything about how to see/extract 2d images of this game at all.
Thx in advance!
