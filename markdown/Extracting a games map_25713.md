- Post Title: Extracting a games map

Hello,
I am a Game developer looking to improve my development skills by trying to remaster a 2006 "Bully: Scholarship Edition" to unreal engine as a personal practice to improve. I have been trying to extract the game's map for the last week but I only got so far. I am using a software called "Ninja Ripper 1.7.1" to export the game files, luckily it did what I needed but in a bad way. I got all the textures and game character models I wanted but the main map was a big problem. When I tried to import it to BLENDER every object is placed in the middle and it looks like a mess (As shown in the picture).

 As much as I learned I know it can be fixed If I manually import an object one by one trying to put everything to place as it should be, but It is not the best way to do it cause it takes so much time for one small area and it's not really accurate as in-game. Is there a way I could export the game's map into one or multiple object files so I wouldn't waste my time manually placing each object? Thank you for your time!
P.S. I tried to export one room from the game into a blender and then into Unreal and every opposite side of each object didn't have a texture (It was invisible). So if anyone knows a fix to that too please help and thanks again:)
