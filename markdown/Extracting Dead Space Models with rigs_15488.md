- Post Title: Extracting Dead Space Models with rigs?

Is it possible to convert the models from the Dead Space games so that they still have their original rigs?

I have the 3D max scripts for extracting the textures, models and skeletons but if I ever get my hand on the animations, making new rigs will probably break the animations.

So is there a way that the models could be exported from .geo to whatever format with their skeletons? Or do I just have to rig them all over again?

Edit: I will leave the scripts for the skeleton and Dead Space 2-3 .geo files below, if anyone wants to have a look:

DS2-3 .geo script (batch)

And here are example models with all of their files from Dead Space 2 and 3

You know the answer xD Of course it's possible, though there's other question - who's going to do this. I'm sure someone will pick this up eventually.

That's good to hear. It would be useful.
