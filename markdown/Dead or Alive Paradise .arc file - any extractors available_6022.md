- Post Title: Dead or Alive Paradise .arc file - any extractors available?

So I went and downloaded a Dead or Alive Paradise ISO (inb4 piracy, I own the game, but had no way to rip my own UMD), and after extracting the ISO, I find an .arc that I suspect contain model files and the like. However, I cannot for the life of me find a .arc extractor that actually works with this particular game. I can't upload the .arc because it's 347 MB and that would take forever on my connection, but I still would like to see if anyone can help with extraction of DOAP's .ARC. Thanks!

TheLemonMan and I worked on an extractor for these files quite a while ago.
Source code available here: [http://blea.ch/~git/git/?p=spark.git;a=summary](http://blea.ch/~git/git/?p=spark.git;a=summary)
I will not give you binaries, compile it yourself. Unless you happen to run 64bit Linux (though I presume you can make your own binaries if you are doing that...)

Thanks for this. I've never compiled code before, but I guess now is as good a time as any to learn.

...Shows why I should pay more attention to topics I create. >.>
I finally remembered that I had created this, go to search for new posts... and the link that guy provided leads to a 404. Anyone have a mirror of said tool?
