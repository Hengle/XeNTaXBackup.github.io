I converted your files into Wavefront .obj/mtl format.

You can download it using the following link:

Can you tell me where I can find the demo version of this game ?
I would like to test it with other sample files.

Today I released the 3D O.C. v4.602 update package.

You can update your installed (or portable) application (version>=4.0) quickly and easily using the auto-update function (Help/Check for updatesâ€¦).
