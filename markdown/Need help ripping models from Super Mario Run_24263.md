Hey all I'm trying to rip a model from Super Mario Run but I have no clue how to go about it. I thought that if I asked here that I could get some hands-on help and experience. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.

Thanks...wow it sounds a lot more complicated than I thought it would be. I'm just trying to rip a model so that I can make a mod but having to deal with encryptions and stuff sounds like a hassle for a one time thing. Not sure what to do from here..It'd be easier if I could get some steps on how to rip the model.
