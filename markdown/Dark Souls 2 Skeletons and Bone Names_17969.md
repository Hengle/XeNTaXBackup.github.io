- Post Title: Dark Souls 2 Skeletons and Bone Names

So I have been trying for a couple of weeks now to load the Dark Souls 2 model files with their proper skeletons, but the problem is that Dark Souls 2's models don't have Skeleton.hkx files.
So does anyone have a script for either the vanilla Dark Souls 2 or the SotFS edition that loads models with proper skeletons and bone names?

Here is a Drive folder with multiple models from different games and platforms (Vanilla PC - SotFS PC - SotFS PS4):

P.S: You can rename the .flv file to .flver if you wanna use the existing scripts.
