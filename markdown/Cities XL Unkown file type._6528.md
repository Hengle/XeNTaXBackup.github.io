- Post Title: Cities XL Unkown file type.

This file was found inside an sgbin, and is located around .dds files.  I looked into the file with hxd and it has some tga files in there so i know its an archive, but it also has a heavily compressed/encrypted body because none of it is readable.  There are alot of people wanting to know more about this file.  anyway here it is, good luck!
