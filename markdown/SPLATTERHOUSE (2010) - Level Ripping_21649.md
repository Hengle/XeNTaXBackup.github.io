Hey guys!
This time I actually have something to show, other then requesting stuff   





Get the noesis/plugin version that is able to handle splatterhouse .nif files with additional skeleton output from my post here:
[viewtopic.php?f=10&t=8506](https://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=8506)

However....
my problem is that i can't export the levels as shown in the noesis preview to either .obj or .fbx with applied/linked textures

   MAKE SURE FLIP UV IS SELECTED     

I tried the .obj export with the command:

```
-objmtl
```

the resulting .mtl file doesn't link the textures correctly when importing in blender.
If I try to export it as .fbx blender won't open it because the version doesn't seem to be supported. I had a friend importing it into 3dsmax and also not having the textures linked correctly.
I don't wanna link all those textures by hand.....theres gotta be a step that im missing....
Help is much appretiated

PEACE
