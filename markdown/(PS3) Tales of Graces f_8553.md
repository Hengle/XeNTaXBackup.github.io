- Post Title: (PS3) Tales of Graces f

Hello, i need some help with the .CPK files in Tales of Graces f, i've been able to extract them, but i need something to repack the files into a .CPK that works with the game.
I've tried using the Cri Packed File Maker, but the game just gives me a black screen.
Here's a file sample: [http://www.mediafire.com/?jsta9nc32js9bcz](http://www.mediafire.com/?jsta9nc32js9bcz)
Any help is appreciated.
