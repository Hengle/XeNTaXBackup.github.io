There's a mmo game Ring of Elysium, almost same thing as Moonlight Blade mmo, here's script for model import, no bones and weights just geometry and uv's. I think, there should be a separate, smaller file for bones/skeleton somewhere. Don't have the game and files, so can't check this xD Here it is, if anyone would like to have just a static meshes

I thinkbones/skeleton is in the .qsg/.dfont/.dat file itself.

Here is what I found:

Yup, it's most-likely skeleton file! With that one and model file it's possible to import rigged models.

The file I open above is .QSG file,which can be imported into 3dmax with your current maxscript,but without skeleton.So the skin and the skeleton are in the same .QSG/.dfont/.dat file
So,what about updating your maxscript?
many thanks!

I will think about it, right now I'm quite busy. I have plans for models/games which I really want myself (like for honor) and I promised some good ppl to do few request (which I already failed to deliver, and so ashamed about it - for someone like for a year omg). So, I have no idea when I will do this particular one, maybe soon if it's an easy part - if it will require time, I most likely will not updated it for a long time. I thought, I should be honest right now and explain everything more detailed lol

Do you have any ideas on how to extract the character's lower body from .sfc files with matched textures  with the invalid filenames efficiently?

It appears, this game just changed it's state for me xD It looks like it has some cool armors! I saw at least 3, that means, I'm personally interested in those models, so I'll try to download client now and I'll work on import maxscript with bigger motivation and interest

As I assumed, skeleton was in separate file (bones inside models are not good, they had less sense to me xD), a lot of small skeletons were lying around xD Thankfully, it was easy to find and import them and weights were fine too. I think, same - exact same thing is with Moonlihgt Blade, maybe I'll look at this game again too. If it has nice armors ofc and not just some asian girls, such models are pointless to me.

I think the skeleton file is Data\Actors\HS_FPP\HS_FPP_Skel.qss
the animation file is .XMD

By the way,the model you imported in the video is from data_bas_0.vfs or any other file?

Hi When I import the model ，Some can succeed，

The model was stretched for no reason！
And there are many

Here's updated script, should import much more models (.dfont, .dat). I have bones and weights support, though I have no idea how to explain to majority of users how to find them  They are nameless, have same .dat extension and you need to have basic hex editor knowledge to easily spot them. I'll try to figure out something xD

Yes, it's possible of course - but not a good idea for now, since some of not working .dfont or .dat could spoil whole process - 3d max will freeze, crash ect (if you at first check a batch of files and they will work it makes sense, to import them all, but it's pointless, since you already checked them lol). Later when script will cover most of models, I will do it or let you pick any amount of them in dialog window, not just one but - like 10 for example.

Remember that .QSG is also the model files too.There's a small problem when I use this script to find and open .QSG file.It doesn't appear.
For bones and weight,how about making a simple tutorial video?

Could you pack .QSG samples for me? I can't extract game right now, don't have space. As for tutorial, if I will not figure out anything better I'll do it, weights are okay you don't need to do anything with them - just find skeletons.

@zaramot Is it time to make a tutorial on how to rig bones?

Í found 4 files inside ACTORS.SFC which I think handle skeletons somehow, kinda hard to know without the file names, I wanted to test them with your script but I have no idea how to make it read these files.

You need this .vfs extractor instead of dzs_qq.bms to correctly get all files.

I extractd some c++ headers from Ring of Elysium\SFC\Common.sfc and guess their filename by their #define
For anyone like me who want to study shader and restore them in UE4  

Btw, that .sfc file stored many macro including gamemode.

I wonder if bone weights logic are stored in QSSHADER_QSSkinning.h so that we can rebuild character skeleton meshes.

Unfortunety I can't help, I've recreated both Hikage and Big Joe however spent many hours looking for the files   

There is definitely a way of finding the weights just not a script kiddie ;c

Nice. It is a shame we can't look at all the costumes in the game without owning them as about 70% of them do not show up in the shop, only the newer ones, so having to dig the files is the only option.

Anyone here have any idea about how to extract the audio from the game? The SFC folder contains mentions to WWISE audio, but extracting the audio using something like Dragon Unpacker has poor results so far.

Game will be shut down and removed from steam in December so if anyone is still interested in this you better save the files while you can.


I have managed to get the model of Lynn using ninja ripper

Which version of Ninja Ripper did you use? I tried, 2.0.13, 2.0.14 and some older versions, even tried global rip. The game doesn't even launch did you use some sort of bypass for the launcher?

Noob here, love this game, If you have any informations for launch the game with Ninja and take something useful before it shut down, it would be great. I've got .SFC file but I don't know how to "open" the file to "extract" the helicopter or some decor for 3d printing.
I only draw something like Greek house on 3D software. I would like to save things before it's gone.
