Does anyone know of an importer / file converter for the Star Wars Galaxies model files? (*.mgn)

If this isn't the model file, someone please correct me.

wow you are a freakin god! U3D!!!

i was lookin all over for that, and now i think im gonna go ahead and purchase the full version!!!

this tool is the best go between tool i have seen yet for translating models to different formats, and pretty soon it will make things a lot easier or the applications i had in mind

im not really good at modding per say, but i wanted to get a good feel for retexturing some of the models, and maybe doing some simple animation

perhaps later i can actually get more involved in the actual modding of the three games i have extracted from (KOTOR 1& 2 and SWG)

but for now i will be satisfied with messing with the meshes

thanks a lot Dinoguy!!!
