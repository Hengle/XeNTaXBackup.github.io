The solution is simple.
1. - To unpack pak files, using WinRar
2. - To edit an XML can do it with a hex editor, Ultraedit example ""not notepad""
3. - After editing you must keep the original size of the file or edit the bytes 9 and 10

Indeed not good way of doing it, but possible, i was trying to figure it out, but still missing 1 piece. Thre are messy data before actual text, not sure exactly what they represent i guess this are offsets to text

So is Michalss, I see an XML file without an ordered structure.
In addition there are labels that contain no values, for example Clip_size in some weapons, despite this I can edit and the game runs

Sounds OK after investigation, but not sure how it will work if strings will be bigger then original, size for whole file is easy as u said there is size mark. But im gonna try will see

This is all wrong xml contains offsets to texts/string of course, so your way it totally wrong until you keep the same size of strings you OK but this is pain not really good for localization! I just cannot figure it out damn i found start offset size and etc... but i cannot find offsets for actuall strings.... Hmm any idea ?

Download HxD Editor, [http://mh-nexus.de/en/hxd/](http://mh-nexus.de/en/hxd/) 

Use this program to edit XML, remember to keep the bytes of the original file size, until we find the offset of the XML files in the archive Pak

1. No. No need to delete the file. Or unpack it (english_xml.pak) in a folder "game" and then delete.
2. Try to pack the files (text_ui_menus.xml, dialog_recording_list.xml) in the file english_xml.pak
3. Try changing one or two letters in a source file (not the ones that I gave, and the source (original from first post) ) and pack the modified file in the file english_xml.pak
If all of this fails, then I can not help you =)
I do not know, what have you on the consoles. We have a PC, all works well. =)

Good!
But, the PC version has 7 XML files:

```
text_ui_menus.xml
ai_dialog_recording_list.xml
credits.xml
loading.xml
pc_keyboard.xml
warnings_ui.xml
```

I have attached these files uncompressed, but in a slightly different format. Edit them using Notepad++.
Put the files in "SniperGhostWarrior2\Game\languages\" (Create this folder)
I have not tested it right, but the menu texts works perfectly.
Enjoy.[/b]

Is this enough proof?:



Dialogs are translatable too, of course - and they working.
The DLC maybe could be problem, I think, 'cause I didn't get to those texts in mean time [I'm playing and translating it simultaneously, when I have mood for this]

Files are available, reupload is unnecessary.
Far enough to point to the post, as i did...

And you didn't even mention the original uploader of the files.
It's not nice, if you post the package as yours...
