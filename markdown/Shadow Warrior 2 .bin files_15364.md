It almost looks like last Hard Reset Redux struct. Except filenames which are down this time. BMS script written by Ekey doesn't work on this. But i think it's a matter of feew lines.

Ahh... just unpacked some of texts. It's zlibed.

```
string filename;
int fileSizeD; decompressed
int fileSizeC; compressed
int filenumber;
int64 offset;

```


EDiT: Strange that game refuse load unpacked files...
