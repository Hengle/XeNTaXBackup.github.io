- Post Title: [Request]Priston Tale 2 Models Extract

Hello, I need some extractor of the models of this game, it is a beautiful game with great models, it is made in Unreal Engine, but I think the files are with some cryptography, because it does not have the normal extension of unreal, I hope us can help me, will upload some files of the game :p

also inside a config file in Bin folder got this:

```
PurgeCacheDays=30
SavePath=..\Save
CachePath=../Cache
CacheExt=.uxx
CacheRecordPath=../System/*.ucl
SpeechPath=../Speech
MusicPath=../Music
TreePath=../Trees
Paths=../System/*.u
Paths=../Maps/*.ut2
Paths=../Textures/*.utx
Paths=../Sounds/*.uax
Paths=../Music/*.umx
Paths=../StaticMeshes/*.usx
Paths=../Animations/*.ukx
Paths=../Saves/*.uvx
```
