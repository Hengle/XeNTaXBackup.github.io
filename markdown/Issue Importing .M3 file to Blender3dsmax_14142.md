- Post Title: Issue Importing .M3 file to Blender/3dsmax

Hello I am currently trying to import a model to blender or 3dsmax from Heros of The Storm using cascview to open the data folder and a .M3 importer script. I have been successful with many .M3 files but whenever i try to open this specific .M3 file i get an error and im not sure why. Any help would be greatly appreciated.



i put it into Dropbox as its to large for an attachment.
