Is it really a crime to ask someone who already knows to give an answer instead of browsing pages and pages of topics with dead links everywhere? I know you have taken the time yourself, but do you want other to spend the same amount of time just because you have?
Theres a topic i found titled "Runmbe Roses import". It seems to be for XX. I can't guess what language the code is in. I know some Python so it's probably not a Blender importer and it's too simple to be a standalone C++ GUI converter. Searching some other topics it seems the 3d files are in an archive of type "PAC", and each are in a "BPE" format file.
The link for the original RR decompressor are dead.
There is also a thread called "Yukes Model Converter" which seems to be for 3dsmax. Someone mentions in the thread about a script named "rumble roses2.ms" but the archive chrrox posted doesnt have that.
That's all I found.

Yeah I've seen that, but what language is that? What about the archive format?
Might you still have the extractor for the original game?
