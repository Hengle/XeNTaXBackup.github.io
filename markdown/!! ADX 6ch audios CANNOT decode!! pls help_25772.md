- Post Title: !! ADX 6ch audios CANNOT decode!! pls help

Hi all!   
Big problem with ADX audio!
I demux the USM videos in PS3 Metal Gear Rising Revengeance demo, each video has 3 ADX files, 2 mono ADX and 1 6ch ADX, totally 3 videos so 9 ADX. I wanna convert ADX to WAV, turns out all the mono ADX are fine, but all the 6ch ADX failed, including playing and converting, with all methods. I guess the problem is the "6ch". Also I dug around, I guess these ADX can be "ADX 2", something like newer than "ADX", maybe there's some difference in there, to make them "un-recognizable"?

what I tried but failed: 
ffmpeg
foobar2000
CubeMedia 2
VLC player and lots of other players
FFmpeg based ADX converter

ADX 6ch sample: (30 days)
