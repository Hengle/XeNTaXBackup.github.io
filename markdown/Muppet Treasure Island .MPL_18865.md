Has anyone tried extracting the archives of this game, I'm sure it's easy to understand given how the formatting looks legible.

Here's the demo sample: [https://archive.org/download/Muppet_int ... P_DATA.MPL](https://archive.org/download/Muppet_interactive_demo/Muppet_demo.zip/Muppet_demo%2FMUP_DATA.MPL)

If it's so simple, then why not extract it yourself? You're more than capable of doing so if it's that "easy". Don't expect others to do all the work for you.

Because I am not a programmer and I expect positive results, like a link to a script or something related to this, please?

Just wanted to say that I've made some progress on researching this file format.
Here are results of my work [http://wiki.xentax.com/index.php/MTropolis_MPL](http://wiki.xentax.com/index.php/MTropolis_MPL)

But unfortunately it's still not enough to extract data.
