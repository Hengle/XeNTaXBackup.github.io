A BMS Script would be great to extract dds file from WAD file.

And "fedrek" please explain how do you get these WAD files?

WAD files are extracted from GOWIII\USRDIR\RES.PSARC. Extract using PSARC PS3 Extractor

I found the .dds files in R_HERO00.WAD (Kratos). But I can not extract them. Maybe someone knows how to write a script BMS? and unpack .WAD archive
