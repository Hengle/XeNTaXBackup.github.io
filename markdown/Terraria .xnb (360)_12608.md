You can unpack them with XNBDecompressor made by alisci01.

Put a link in code tag. And later you can remove it.

I have tried this decompressor and it works on x360 xnbs. Only "problem" could be, that uncompressed xnbs has "XNBw" header, but you can change it, if it's necessary.

I thought you are trying to decompress that xnbs, but if you want original images, sounds etc. from xnbs you will need some converter.
