- Post Title: DNF Duel AES Key

AES key for DNF DUEL has been located and extracted

Apparently DNF DUEL is using Unreal 4.25.

Here's the AES KEY for it 

0xC846350F8B8D946D00DC58801A81478FFBEE888C8F9CD323A493C64E89B87ECA.

I also highly recommend that before extracting the game model, make sure to export it as "GLFT."
and do not export it as FBX. The reason why I'm saying this is because uModel breaks them if it's not GLTF.
It breaks the normals, which is not a good thing.

If you guys want to replicate the same shading from the game to Blender or unity then please use Aerthas Shader! 
the shader will do most of your work.

For Blender

For Unity

Have Fun!!!

if you wouldn't mind if you know could you help me figure out what I'm doing wrong with this shader? [https://gyazo.com/5951ee8c2ba3efbd3349bdff2f3027c9](https://gyazo.com/5951ee8c2ba3efbd3349bdff2f3027c9)
