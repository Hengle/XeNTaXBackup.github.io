Sorry to necro, but, do you have any idea what a zig file is (besides the whole ZigGIS [http://geobabble.wordpress.com/2007/02/ ... zig-files/](http://geobabble.wordpress.com/2007/02/21/working-with-zig-files/)  and ZIG Game Construction Kit thing?)
And how did you rip these files from the game, and what tools did you use?
