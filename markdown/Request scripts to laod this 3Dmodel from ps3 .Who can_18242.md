This is what I got using hex2obj.



What game is this? Kamen rider or something? Better write the name of the game in the title.

Just open your file with hex2obj and type in the values as shown in akderebur's and my screenshots and you'll get the whole model.
If you want to do the same with other files, you'll have to do it yourself. Visit the tutorial section for further infomation, or you can check the link in my signature to get a clue of how to start.
