I'm also interested in this. I'm currently learning about ghidra, maybe theres a way to skip that USB check... I'm unsure the skill level required for this but it'd be interesting if we can get it playable similar to PC Hatsune Miku Diva arcade port...

Edit: Some other ideas/notes
- Game launches into force 1080p (am on 1440p monitor)
- If we can spoof the usb device its looking for, we'll get to the next step in this long process...

Also here's the output of the `ioupdate.exe` file if anyone is interested. I'm assuming its trying to update but it fails because the servers are down.
