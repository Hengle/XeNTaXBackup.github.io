hed/dat files are the ones that use ROT encryption with some huge key.
Other games that use this are

[viewtopic.php?f=21&t=7039](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=21&t=7039) - pandora saga
[viewtopic.php?f=10&t=4539](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=4539) - ai sp@ce

hed files contain the file table.

It seems like quite some work just to extract them, and you need the correct hed/dat pair in order to get it working.

he can reverse the algorithm completely but he needs to be able to launch the main game is this game still going in beta?
he needs the command line parameter they use to start the game if i could launch the client i could give it to him and it would be done for all the games.
