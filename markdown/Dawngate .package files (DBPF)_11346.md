- Post Title: Dawngate ".package" files (DBPF)

Hey Guys, 
I want to modify some of the Dawngate files.
I was able to unpack the .snap-files of this game, but I need help with the ".Package" files.
(QuickBMS Script would be nice).

I uploaded some of the files for you.

Thank you!

This Extractor can only extract ".snap" Files.
But I asked for a ".package"-Extractor (DBPF)^^
