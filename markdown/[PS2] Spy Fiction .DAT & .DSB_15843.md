- Post Title: [PS2] Spy Fiction .DAT & .DSB

Little known fact, the US release of Spy Fiction was redubbed, even though the Japanese release had English voice acting to begin with.
The dialogue is very different in the original and I'd like to back port it into the US release.

All the game's data is in an ISO file of sorts, ALLDATA.DAT and ALLDATA.DSB. The .DSB file appears to be a directory file linking to the .DAT.

Both the Japanese and American release have this format (the picture above is from the Japanese).
I'd appreciate if someone could help find a way to unpack and repack this file.... Spy Fiction needs some love.
