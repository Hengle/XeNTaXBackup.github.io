- Post Title: Life is Strange (Android) - PAK file repack

Hi I want to repack .pak file from Life is Strange (Android)
(I used quickBMS and unrealtournament4.bms for unpack)
[http://aluigi.altervista.org/bms/unreal ... ment_4.bms](http://aluigi.altervista.org/bms/unreal_tournament_4.bms)

I tried UnrealPak.exe with that code for pack;

```
"C:\Users\02\Desktop\UnrealPak.exe" "C:\Users\02\Desktop\xxxx.pak" -create=C:\Users\02\Desktop\filelist.txt -compress
```


filelist.txt;

```
"C:Users\02\Desktop\Game\1\Engine\*" "../../../Engine/"
```

and

```
"C:Users\02\Desktop\Game\1\LiS\*" "../../../LiS/"
```


But not worked.
