How to use Noesis with your Xbox 360 Kinect:

1 - Uninstall any existing versions of OpenNI/NITE.
2 - Download [http://www.richwhitehouse.com/pubdata/O ... ackage.zip](http://www.richwhitehouse.com/pubdata/ONI_15_Kinect_Package.zip)
3 - Install OpenNI from the zip.
4 - Install NITE from the zip.
5 - Install SensorKinect from the zip.
6 - Reboot.
7 - Make sure your Kinect is plugged in and connected to your PC.
8 - Run the latest version of Noesis. Go to Tools->Kinect interface.
9 - Load the Noesis scenes\sample_guy.dae model, it comes with a .noekin file that will be auto-loaded. It serves as an example for how to map your model skeleton to the Noesis mocap skeleton.

It's not a plugin, it's built-in functionality. And no, a 360 is not required, just a Kinect.
> 7 - Make sure your Kinect is plugged in and connected to your PC.
