Standard opus files are in fact OGG containers [http://wiki.xentax.com/index.php/OGG_Container](http://wiki.xentax.com/index.php/OGG_Container)
and they can be played  in foobar2000 with vgmstream plugin without issues.

You can encode/decode such files with opus-tools [https://opus-codec.org/downloads/](https://opus-codec.org/downloads/)


BUT your samples seem to be encrypted and not playable using those methods.

I already told you that your samples might be encrypted and they can't be converted directly. 
(assuming that they are really files with OPUS audio, NOT custom ones)
