- Post Title: WWF Royal Rumble - .PAC file

I've come across one of Yukes/THQ's earlier PAC format files for WWF Royal Rumble, a Dreamcast game. Unfortunately, not a single PAC extractor I've found will extract the content. Here's a sample if anyone's interested in taking a look at it.

The file was originally bundled in an AFS archive, if that helps.

Sorry for the late response, but other chores are taking up all of my time.

See [http://www.xentax.com/?p=90](http://www.xentax.com/?p=90)

But when I'm done with that, I will go through the requests and check if I can help out.
