I have opened an issue on your case [https://github.com/yosh778/YsVIII-tools/issues/11](https://github.com/yosh778/YsVIII-tools/issues/11)
Maybe author will help.


Edit: I've just saw that makcar had similar issue earlier   
[https://github.com/yosh778/YsVIII-tools/issues/10](https://github.com/yosh778/YsVIII-tools/issues/10)
So maybe you will need some programmer to correct and compile those scripts for you.
