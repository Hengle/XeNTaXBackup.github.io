Spider-Man: Miles Morales PS4 tool. Works same as Spider-Man PS4:

First you need to decompress "toc" file from specific version you're using. You can do it with quickbms or offzip.exe
For example: offzip.exe -a toc outputfolder 0
After that, rename decompressed file to "toc" and replace it.

Then correct INI file for the folder where you have game data files
Then run some of these commands:

1. spiderman 99807473A3981A8D - will extract that asset
2. spiderman 99807473A3981A8D c:\spider\iw - will extract asset into folder with name you specified
3. spiderman list.txt - will extract ALL assets in list

asset lists (all assets, models only, maps only) for versions 1.00 & 1.05 - [https://www60.zippyshare.com/v/3CUfzReQ/file.html](https://www60.zippyshare.com/v/3CUfzReQ/file.html)

Can you make something to extract the audio asset of the game, please?
I've been trying to get the audio files for days, but nothing works, it's so frustrating.
Everything is mostly corrupted or unplayable.

Hey! I was wondering if someone could swing me The T.R.A.C.K. Suit costume files? I unfortunately lost my chance at getting it before due to a hiatus I took.

Just hoping someone could look out.

were you able to add support for animations? not pushing just wondering.
Also the reason people want to donate to you is because. without you this whole reverse engineering scene goes belly up.

Is it something you can look into? and gauge the amount of work needed and see if its feasible?
The animations there are wickedly unique. Maybe they are even using the same animation format from sunset to spidey 1 and miles?

Could you please point me towards what exact file types the animations reside in and the type of animation tech they use...?

I agree, with Spider-Man Remastered now released on pc, i've been going through the game files and have found the animations that are specific to miles' web swinging but they are .animclip files and cannot be used in any program that i've found so far.

Would be great if if were possible to do this as it's a very highly requested mod and i'm currently working on trying to import the animations into the game but as i said, i can't find a way to open them.

For reference the animations are in the following locations:
g00s000/characters/hero/hero_spiderman/animations
g00s000/characters/hero/hero_spiderman/animations/traversal

Thanks for the work put into the tool so far!

Hi everyone, I am trying to mod Roxxon Rhino from Spider-Man: Miles Morales PC version but I having trouble extracting .model and some .texture files

Here are the steps I did to extract files:
1. I used MMPCTool (v1.0.2 from Nexusmods) to search and extract .model and .texture files
2. I drag and drop .model (npc_rhino_roxxon.model)
onto spiderman_pc_model.exe(V0.55beta (note:I can not use V0.56 because my window10 keep delete the file due to virus report)).
Black window of Command Prompt pop-up for a second and disappear (doesn't have any text inside the Command Prompt)
and I did not get any new .ascii file.
3. I drag and drop .texture files onto MSMTextureConverter.exe (v.1.0.3 from github by WilianZilv) to convert to .dds files
All the normal textures(name "_n_") extracted fine however, some of the textures that name with "_c_" and "_g_" looks broken
This is the broken texture looks like: [https://imgur.com/HmRbNZ8](https://imgur.com/HmRbNZ8)

I also upload .model and .texture files, along with extracted .dds files with some broken file. Here for you to try:
[https://easyupload.io/27mynq](https://easyupload.io/27mynq)

I am wondering IF the tools I use here only work with PS4 file? However, I do see alot of mod for Spider-Man, Miles Morales character suit.
Or is its that the tools only work with some files/not all the files? Or maybe some of the steps that I did here are incorrect?

Please help, Thank you.
