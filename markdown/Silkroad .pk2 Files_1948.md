You have tried zipping the file too make an .Zip extension? =/

or maybe its possible to just give a fake extension? =)

but then instead. you will probably recive another error that the file
is too large.

what about 

[http://jaedernaub.ath.cx](http://jaedernaub.ath.cx)

It can parse thru .pk2 files and rip out the goodies.
*mainly DDS textures*

maybe it will not find everything in those archives,
but atleast will give you a hint of whats in them.

This is second request for this game  [viewtopic.php?t=1877](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?t=1877)

Silkroad pk2 files are packed (archived just like winrar, or winzip) but folder structure is encrypted with a modified blowfish table 

SREmu -> [http://darkinc.org/sremu/index.php](http://darkinc.org/sremu/index.php) they have private extractor

In the last days I developed the new FREE internal export module called 'Tools/Export the material table's textures to .bmp files'. that supports the Silkroad .ddj format.

See the Supported texture file formats:

I released the 3D O. C. V4.429 update package now.
