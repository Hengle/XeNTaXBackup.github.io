- Post Title: Desperados .scb files: Need help decompiling mission scripts

The mission scripts from the game Desperados: Wanted Dead or Alive were written in a custom scripting language.
Unfortunately the devs compiled those scripts so it's impossible to edit them.

Could you guys please help us figuring out how to convert the mission bytecode back to it's original form?

Here's a thread that discusses the file format:
