For anyone wondering the game, its Tokyo Xanadu.

However it's a PSVita only game, I'm super interested in how you managed to get the .pkg file from the vita itself.

its easy to get the files off vita games. He is only posting one file from the games he is dumping so no one is going to support the games without more samples.

Yeah, I think the same
Not the entire data file
To give a single file as a sample
No one is asking your thing you do not want to be challenged
What do you think that the situation is unknown, but do not want anyone
