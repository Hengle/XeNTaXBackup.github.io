- Post Title: Deathloop model importer

Based on this blender script[viewtopic.php?f=18&t=15518&hilit=dishon ... 60#p176066](https://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=18&t=15518&hilit=dishonored&start=60#p176066)
I rewrite it to support Deathloop.Currently *.bmd6model/*.bmodel/*.edgeskl/*.bwm is supported.
Blender 2.9.2 tested 

```
2021.9.21 v3:Add .bwm support
2021.9.21 v4:Fix a bug that fails to import bmd6model StaicMesh
2021.9.27 v5:fix a bug that fails to import *.bwm

```

Hey, great work.
I can't seem to import weapon models, I get a failure message "Error: Could Not Import"
I'm using the files from .\generated\basemodel\models\equipment\weapon\_asset\[class]\[weapon]\mesh\
Thanks

Hey Guys, I was wondering if theres a tool for extracting the models and where I could find it. Can anyone point me in the right direction? you use this tool called "quickbms"  [http://aluigi.altervista.org/bms/deathloop.bms](http://aluigi.altervista.org/bms/deathloop.bms) you can find the deathloop script here

Heya, thanks for writing the script! Here are some issues that I've found:
Hair meshes on complex hair don't import correctly

And another thing that I've found is that imported meshes have basically unnamed vertex groups i.e.:
Here's what the skeleton bone names look like

And here are the vertex group names

I used "\generated\basemodel\models\character\player\juliana\_asset\body_a01\tech\f_juliana_head_a01.bmd6model" and didn't see the issue while vertex groups are unnamed.

Maybe the file you used is low LOD.
Could you please upload the sample files

Okay, I've probably stumbled onto some sort of recompiled meshes  . Importing from the path you wrote results in complete hair mesh, thanks. 
That leaves vertex groups, I guess I can rename them manually or find a script that could handle it for me.
Do you have any clue on how to convert texture files? There are a bunch of BMS scripts for this format, but they are made for specific games.
Thanks again!

If you have imported skeleton before, it will rename vertex groups automatically with the skeleton selected.
I am not familar with texture files, may not be able to process texture files

The script will check whether you have the following paths "your_BMS_export_path\generated" and "your_BMS_export_path\generated\decls"
If you have both these paths, it won't show error.

Thats why , ive been singling out the map files to export quicker. thanks

I made a rough [python script here](https://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=18&t=24524&p=178929#p178929) that's capable of generating .dds files based on the original .bimage files, although there's a couple of compression types it doesn't work on. I noticed that the bmodel importer script does work pretty well at automatically using the converted .dds textures once they're there, although for character models it doesn't seem to be picking up eyelashes or hair, so that might have to be adjusted manually:

Hi everyone,

I'm running into an error when trying to extract some of the files using QuickBMS, for example "rsc_images_1_1.resources" and "rsc_images_2_0.resources". I run the script on "master_resources.index" and once it hits one of the problem files it says:

So while I can extract and import maps I get very few textures. I know nothing about this stuff so I'm unsure if this was caused by the latest patch or if I'm doing something wrong. Any help would be appreciated.

Thank you.

Hello, I've been trying to use QuickBMS to extract files from Deathloop, but I get this error:

"Error: incomplete input file 0: C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\DEATHLOOP\base\master_resources.index
       Can't read 1848903863 bytes from offset 0000000003cbf7ec.
       Anyway don't worry, it's possible that the BMS script has been written
       to exit in this way if it's reached the end of the archive so check it
       or contact its author or verify that all the files have been extracted.
       Please check the following coverage information to know if it's ok.

  coverage file 0   100%   63698924   63698924   . offset 0000000003cbf7ec

Last script line before the error or that produced the error:

Press ENTER or close the window to quit"

And the only thing in the output folder are a few empty folders and a single .decl file

Sorry to necro this, I'm trying to get the Strelak Verso pistols (models, textures, and hopefully animations too) out of the game and either the deathloop bms script on quickbms' website is incorrect/outdated or I'm doing it wrong.
In the case of the script being outdated, the link you've posted to the updated code is invalid unfortunately.

As for the incorrect methodology, my steps are as follows.
1) Run quickbms
2) Select the deathloop.bms script (from the quickbms site)
3) Select "master_resources.index
4) Select output location.
5) Receive error
