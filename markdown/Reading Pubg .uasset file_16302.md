- Post Title: Reading Pubg .uasset file

Hey I'm trying to read the text information found within PlayerUnknown's Battleground files. Mainly looking at Filenamehere.uasset which seems to be the file which contains the information I'm not too sure how to go about it, I've been searching high & low for an answer but I've not managed to do so albeit I've probably overlooked it somewhere, any guidance please?  I know the games source was done in UE4 4.15 but opening files with that version still declares a newer version of UE4 was used so it's also not helping me in this situation.The file in question is mainly in text with the rest in binary but I'm not sure how to go about reversing the binary into a readable format any help would be great
