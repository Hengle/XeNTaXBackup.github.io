From what I can tell, the files are .MU. However, I can't get at them because my method for extracting from .pak files won't work. That method is quickbms, using the most recent unreal_tournament.bms file. Any suggestions?

Do you want me to post a .MU file or one of the .pak files? Because I don't have the .MU files yet. Based off a thread at Zenhax, the extracted .pak files are (curiously) broken. And that was from my own disc. So, after downloading a .pkg from [elsewhere], I tried using pkgEditor on that instead, but got the same result.
