- Post Title: God of War series localization

Hello. I'm a very big fan of GoW and I have a bunch of free time now. So I'm thinking of localizating the series.
First two games on the PS2 has no subtitle text, so I'm thinking of starting with GoW 3 and GoW Ascension for the PS3.
Maybe you think I'm crazy. But I promise to complete the task with some helps from you. Though this will be my first translating experience, but I have some basic in this field. So I just need some help from you.

First is GoW 3 for PS3.
Can you tell me which file to look for the DDS font and the subtile text?
