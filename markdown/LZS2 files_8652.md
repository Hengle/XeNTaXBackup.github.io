- Post Title: LZS2 files

Hi, guys. I'm trying to extract and/or convert a bunch of image files I got from a PSP ISO, but they're all LZS2 files (not LZS as I first thought). The only program that recognizes the file type is the DS Tool Tinke: [http://code.google.com/p/tinke/](http://code.google.com/p/tinke/) 



It gives me the option to see the hex contents of the files.



As you can see here, some files have 'GimConv' at the end of the hex. Does this mean that they might all be GIM files? If so, how can I convert them from LZS2 to GIM?

I uploaded the LZS2 file pack here if you feel like taking a look: [http://www.mediafire.com/?0v0a1zvrup8mlq8](http://www.mediafire.com/?0v0a1zvrup8mlq8)

By the way, this is from a visual novel so they're all 2D images only! (as in, CGs).
