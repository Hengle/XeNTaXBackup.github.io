- Post Title: Wreck It Ralph .GLOB

So I got the ISO for Wreck It Ralph for the Wii, and I got the contents dumped from that in the model folder it had the character folders labeled and everything but this GLOB format is where I am now stuck. I'm hoping that one of these will be the armored suit for Ralph. And if it can be figured out I could get Calhoun too. Any help would be appreciated, thanks.
