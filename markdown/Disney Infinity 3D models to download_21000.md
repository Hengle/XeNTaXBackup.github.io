Checkout either

[https://gamesrepository.000webhostapp.com/](https://gamesrepository.000webhostapp.com/)
[https://www.models-resource.com/](https://www.models-resource.com/)

Both are in the PC section under "D";

Which characters would you prefer, from DI 1? DI 2's textures are such a jumbled mess, it's not worth searching through them tbh.

If you search long enough for it on here or Zenhax or even Google, you'll find the DI3.0 script (PC Gold Edition) that you use in conjunction with Blender.. not sure about the other DI versions but all or at least most of the characters/content from the previous versions are included in 3.0 including hidden extras.. 
The models are reasonably easy to find within the game directory, though Ecelon is right, all the texture maps for characters/props/everything are located in the one 'textures' folder inside a ton of .zip files that also requires the blender script to extract.. It's very tedious sorting through all of the textures so an alternative would be to use Ninja Ripper & get the textures that way as a slightly easier option...
I dont check this site often unless I'm trying to rip something new but I'm a bit of a guru at this game so If you want help, either message me here or projinf3d AT gmail DOT COM

he's under the prefix 'emp'... go into the characters folder and search 'chewbacca', there will be a few of them.. the  model is in 'emp_chewbacca.zip'.
