- Post Title: Trinium Wars import tool

I got bored so I made this.
Formats used in this game were pretty simple, so it can import static and skinned meshes with materials and animations.
Anyway for technical side, this game is really bad. Release date was in 2013 I think, but looks like it was made in 2003 and they charged 15$ fo it, really??? Geez. No wonder it got discontinued. I have played F2P games that looked much better than this.



Detailed information and tool download.
