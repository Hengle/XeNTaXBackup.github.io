- Post Title: Is there a way to disable the display of part of a model on HeroForge?

The main reason I ask is because sometimes certain head apparel will condense or compress a hairstyle, and I'm wondering how certain hairstyles (all of them, really) would look in their compacted form that can't be viewed so long as the crown (Crystal Crown in this case) is still visible. I'm hoping there's a way to disable the display of that particular part of the model. The pictures I've included will hopefully convey what I'm trying to achieve. I think the closest this has ever been to being possible was when [Pro users could disable the display of parts of the model by completely deleting any adjustable value](https://i.imgur.com/5MUYYqw.png), but that was swiftly patched like a week after I found out about it. Anyway, if this is possible, I hope someone will be able to explain how to make it happen.
