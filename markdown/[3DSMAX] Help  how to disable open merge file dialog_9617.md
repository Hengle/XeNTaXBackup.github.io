Hi , please help me to solve these problem

1. When i double click a .MAX file , the new windows of 3ds max opened, although there is already have a 3dsmax window i opened before
That means i want to open the .MAX file in the existed 3ds max window -which i opened before 
(without have to drop .max file into 3dsmax )
please tell me how ?

2 .How to disable this dialog when drop a 3d model file to 3ds max ? it's annoying when dropping .max files and this dialog appears ,we have to click many times


i want it to choose : "open file" as default , please  tell me how to do it
and when we want this dialog appear again ,how to do that ?

and the same with this dialog : when i use ctrl+N( new scene) how to make it choose "New ALL" as default ?


3. Do you know how to make 3ds max always show the model statistics ?



i always have to hit "7" key to show model statistics,
 when i drop a new model ,this information disappears ,although i have check "show statistics in active view"

1.  Use Ctrl+O after opening 3DSMax and use the file dialog to browse to the file you wish to open.

2.  Unfortunately, those dialogs cannot be disabled.

3.  This may be a bug and something you might have to live with.
