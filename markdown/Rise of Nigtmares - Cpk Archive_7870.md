it's a classical CRI CPK archive.
use quickbms + cpk.bms or the original utf_tab suite of hcs:

it works perfectly with the files you provided.
if it returns that error with the others than mean they are not supported or are no cpk at all.

the script is valid for the reinjection so read carefully the section 3 of quickbms.txt:

that cpk you linked indeed doesn't contain the UTF header, it looks encrypted or similar

Yes, it is encrypted. I made a special build for this once, it seems this just uses the same key.
[http://hcs64.com/files/utf_tab07b4_special.zip](http://hcs64.com/files/utf_tab07b4_special.zip)

There are two cpk_unpack executables in the zip, read the special_readme.txt for instructions. I don't know which is the right one to use, but I'm guessing cpk_unpack1.exe.

(ok, I checked it on the cut thing you sent, cpk_unpack1.exe is the right one, I think)
