It doesn't look like a valid ogg file - Foobar doesn't recognise it.  You can try dropping the bnk file directly into Foobar and the vgmstream plugin might play the files without needing to do anything else.

If not, then it's probably best if you upload a sample of the original .bnk archive - use something like [http://aluigi.altervista.org/bms/filecutter.bms](http://aluigi.altervista.org/bms/filecutter.bms) to get an extract of it.

You can use file hosting sites like Mega, Dropbox, etc. if necessary.

The ones that aren't readable are just empty files - they have no audio data, so you can ignore them.
