Here a new request. i tried with an lzo generic unpacker, but the results are "strange".

Maybe zlib (again)?

Cheers:

Examining the file i found

"PCD9DXT1Â¸Âª      â‚¬    =" "PCD9DXT5Â¸Âª      â‚¬    =", ...dds files with different header?.

The files are 150mb's each like: bigfile.000, bigfile.001  etc... i don't know if every big file have audio and dds, or the audio it's in other file

First that came across my mind when scanning thru the cutted files 
is the "ENIC" header.......Cine? ...could it be a video format?

or maybe its a compressor identifier....just a thought.....

Okay i tested with a big file and "extracted" (with hexworkshop), normally every big file have a 20 "ENIC" files (aprox).

Every "ENIC" are 50-60kb's (aprox)

The files can't be really compressed.

Here a samples extracted:

[http://rapidshare.de/files/17325426/2.cine.html](http://rapidshare.de/files/17325426/2.cine.html)
[http://rapidshare.de/files/17325446/3.cine.html](http://rapidshare.de/files/17325446/3.cine.html)

Edited:

Here my theory: The ENIC files, are the cinematics, there you can see the text of the cine's (in differents languages -5-), i dont' know wich compressorused (if it's used)

Every big file have:

-Textures' dxt1 and dtx5 -identified-
-Cinematics -identified-
-Texts of cinematics -identified-
-The audio (voices and music) -NOT identified-

And maybe i forgett something.

The progam unpack ALL files, still in early version, but looks very good.

Someone asked me to help them with this, so I've been taking the game apart for the last few days. The current version of my [toolset](http://lara.turfster.be) supports bigfile and drmfile extraction and texture and model conversion.

Nope, haven't touched the audio (PS2 audio is my nemesis), but darkfader's mul2wav tool should work (apart from occasionally getting the number of channels wrong in the header)
