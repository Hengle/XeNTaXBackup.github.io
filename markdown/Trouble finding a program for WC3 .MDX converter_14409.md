- Post Title: Trouble finding a program for WC3 .MDX converter

I did do a search here to see if anyone else had posted this and didn't see anything to cover my issue. I just found some of the newer models for WoW that's out there and they're in an MDX format. I've tried Noesis but that didn't work. Didn't seem to support it and not found a plugin that can do it either so that I can convert it to something I can use in Blender. I also tried Biturn, which had been working but not with these that I got off another site.  

So at a loss what to do. Is there a free viewer that will let me see .mdx models and save/convert them to another format successfully?
