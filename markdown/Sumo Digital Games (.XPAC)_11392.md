Hi Guys sorry for replying so late... may be even this thread is dead.
However I have some interesting things to share.

First I have been trying to mod Virtua tennis 3 for ages. I have so far been able to extract some DDS file with game archive extractor.
The files are named as their starting and ending hex offsets. I edit the DDS file and then use a hex editor to replace the bytes in XPAC archive.

however this is a very long process. If possible can some please help me.

I have been so far able to replace federer's kit with a custom nike kit.

now this extractor seems like a ray of hope  however if you can guide me as to how do i edit and replace the extracted resources back in XPAC that would the final nail in coffin.

Hope you take my point seriously..

I have been trying to mod this game for 10 years. 

Please help.
