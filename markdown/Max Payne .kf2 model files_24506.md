Apparently MilkShape 3D works with these files, you can try using it, [here](https://www.moddb.com/games/max-payne/tutorials/milkshape-tutorial) is a tutorial.

I haven't looked into it much but froim what I see,  the format for the.kf2 meshes seems to be similar to the ldb format (with some new attribute bytes). Take a look at my unldb tool at [viewtopic.php?f=16&t=24488&p=179267&hil ... ne#p179267](https://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=24488&p=179267&hilit=MAx+PAyne#p179267) for further details of the general serialization format.
