- Post Title: Anyone Ever Tried Gamecube Games?

I know this seems like a rather Unusual question but im gonna ask it anyways because I dont see why it cant be done.
"Has Anyone managed to get any files or data from a Nintendo GameCube game?".
Now I know that the cd/dvd drive on a normal PC (obviously the makers can read it) cannot even DETECT Gamecube Mini Dvds, but provided you legally OWN the game that you want to get into there is a way to do it.
I am not sure if the way to do it is tollerable in these forums so im not going to explain it.
Tho i do not believe it to be illegal because its just sending the data from ur NGC to your PC in an ISO file.
I wondered if anyone has ever tried this and attempted to look at the files ont he game disk, if so did you get anything from it?
The files may be useable in some applications, I say this because unlike Playstation or XBOX games, they cannot be read by a convention DVD/CD drive, so the creaters wont need to create like 40000 lines of code to protect their data, though this is only something I believe makes sense.
Of course most makers will still protect their stuff as there are most likely aware of the fault in the gamecubes Internet Capabilities, so they might know that people cna still get their hands on the data.

I'm not sure about doing that, I know that there aren't any Gamecube game formats on the WIKI, though...
