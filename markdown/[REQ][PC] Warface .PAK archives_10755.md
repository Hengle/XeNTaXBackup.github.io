Hey. Can someone rewrite Crysis 3 PakDecrypt tool to be compatible with Warface .PAK files?

Source of PakDecrypt here >> [http://cnew.pro/PainteR/cry/PakDecrypt_src.rar](http://cnew.pro/PainteR/cry/PakDecrypt_src.rar) and [http://dl.dropbox.com/u/62858477/stuff/PakDecrypt.7z](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/62858477/stuff/PakDecrypt.7z)

A key to Warface from h4x0r here >> [http://pastebin.com/tRQbBJKa](http://pastebin.com/tRQbBJKa)

Example .PAK files from Warface here >> [http://rghost.net/44346840](http://rghost.net/44346840) and [http://www.putlocker.com/file/FCFD40E73E77B5B4](http://www.putlocker.com/file/FCFD40E73E77B5B4)

Any help will be appreciated

EU key : [http://pastebin.com/uznhei78](http://pastebin.com/uznhei78) (Pakdecrypt sources didn't compile (VS 2012). If somebody'll do it, please post it here.)
About chinese version: I can't attach memory viewer to it - it instantly crashes.

Assembler code: xor [ecx-7E7EFD77],al

Could someone upload a version that works with the US/NA client?

and stVALVe, you have to use command prompt to open PakDecrypt.exe

(windows button + r) type: cmd, then navigate to the folder (using command prompt: cd changes the directory) containing PakDecrypt.exe
Then type:
PakDecrypt.exe {the file you want to decrypt} {the name of the decrypted file}

Leave out the brackets, and make sure you have the files you want to decrypt in the same location as PakDecrypt.exe

yep, I know how to use PakDecrypt.exe itself but problem is it don't work with EU client.
PakDecrypt creates zip archives but you can't open it. 
Looks like EU-version uses another crypting. 
I hope that somebody can give us a workable EU Warface decrypter.
