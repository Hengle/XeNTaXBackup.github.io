- Post Title: Dead Space 3 filelist project.

[https://github.com/gibbed/Gibbed.Visceral](https://github.com/gibbed/Gibbed.Visceral)

I remember i uise to have a filelist porject for dead space 3 but lost it, and this is all i could find relating to gibbed visceral tool, but nothing dead space 3 related.

Anyone know of a hook for the ds3 exe to catch filenames so i can some how update this project?
