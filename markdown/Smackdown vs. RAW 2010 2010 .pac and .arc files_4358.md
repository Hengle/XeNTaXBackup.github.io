Hi

I was wondering whether anyone knows of a way to re-compress the *.pac files used in SvR 2010? There are tools to decompress them, but no tools that I know of at this time that can re-compress them again... and since I'm no good with hex editing, it means that I cannot insert anything into the pacs.

Also, if anyone knows of a working extractor and/or recompiler for the *.arc files from the same game (neither U8Mii nor UltimateU8 seems to work), that would be awesome as well.

*bump*

I'd love to have a tool like this as well.

I've written an application which does this for you. It works with the ps2,wii and xbox 360 pac files. I've also posted tutorials. Check out my site for more info: [http://sf4mods.blogspot.com](http://sf4mods.blogspot.com). There is no need to recompress the bpe files, the game can read uncompressed data.

You havent specified which system thi is for. For the ps2, nikethebike has released a tool which edits your arc files for you. For the xbox, hex editing is the only way to go.
