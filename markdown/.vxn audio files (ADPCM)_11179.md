- Post Title: *.vxn audio files (ADPCM)

Hello there!

I've recently encountered vxn files which seem to contain some ADPCM stream although I'm not sure I have seen this variant before. The format is sometimes used in mobile games for Android or iOS. I'd be glad if somebody could look into implementing the format into vgmstream!

Thanks for all!
