Hey everyone!

I'm relatively new to all of this modelling and extracting business (but not new enough to not know how to search)! I was wondering if there'd been any progress regarding extracting character and dinosaur models from Jurassic Park. I know the data had been cracked, but wasn't able to find an importing script for 3DS MAX so I can actually get at the models themselves and port them to other programs. Has this changed?

I understand someone managed to do it, but they won't release the files until July for some stupid reason or tell me how it was done.

I've added support for Jurassic Park: The Game now (and Law and Order: Legacies since it used the same format).
