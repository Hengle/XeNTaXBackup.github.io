- Post Title: XnaLara maxscript - bone rotations support

Script doesn't work for any of the models made by daemon's tools because his ASCII has bone rotations, which is cool btw. And there's a lot of models.
Is anyone able to add to this script support for bone rotations and more than 1 uv channel?

Here's a sample model of jensen from DXMD: [https://drive.google.com/file/d/16djtOe ... sp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/16djtOeznwrNEb7DRI-QekY8vflH_O6NV/view?usp=sharing)

the latest version of the script I have is attached
