- Post Title: Help with extracting 2D assets from SAO Lycoris

Hi!
I'd like to get some pictures from SAO Lycoris (character's sprites, and eventually CG scenes too).

With Crilayla and Quickbms, I was able to extract a file that looks like what i'd like to have, but it's in tga.phyre format. From what I understood, it needs to be decompressed in order to get the actual image (tga format). I also checked this file in a Hex editor, to confirm it.

Unfortunately, I do not find anything about how to extract a phyre file... Does anyone know how to do it? Could you please teach me how, or tell me where to find relevant tutorials?
Apparently, there may have been information on Zenhax, but the website is down :/

Thanks for your help 

PS: here is the file I extracted [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1i-tgnh ... sp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1i-tgnhmApFC1uviSTvvxjeXPeeqIkt1m/view?usp=sharing)

I'm unfamiliar with RYHP containers, but they appear like generic container files with a directory and file list, no special encryption or compression (see image below). See if any other games use the same format (e.g. mentioned here [viewtopic.php?t=17545](https://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?t=17545)). Short of figuring out RYHP layout, this thread has a good list of raw binary file viewers to at least visualize things: [viewtopic.php?t=15540](https://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?t=15540) Btw, nice Digimon perler bead creations.

Thanks a lot! I'll check with a Viewer tool, then.
And thanks for the perlers, I had a great time doing those

Could someone please tell me how to extract tga.phyre from a file with no extension extracted from a CPK file?
â€»I am Japanese. I'm sorry that it's hard to convey.
