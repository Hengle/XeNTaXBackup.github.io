Dunno, whether it's for PC version but there is a thread already. 
The author didn't share a script, iirc: [viewtopic.php?f=16&t=18061&hilit=bullet+witch](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=18061&hilit=bullet+witch)

Anyways the mesh format looks easy (using hex2obj, view links in my sig):

(If you want anyone to care for the script you need to upload an XBOX 360 sample.
Before that noone can decide if it's worth the effort to "adjust" the script for PC.)
