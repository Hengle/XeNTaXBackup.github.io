- Post Title: SSX and Tricky maps: curved surfaces exported to blender

I have just figured out how to extract the curved surfaces from the SSX and SSX Tricky maps to Wavefront .obj files that can be imported into Blender. See:

They use a Bi-cubic BÃ©zier surface but a big trick is they pre-multiple the control points by some matrices.

Would be great if someone can figure out how the textures map to the patches.
