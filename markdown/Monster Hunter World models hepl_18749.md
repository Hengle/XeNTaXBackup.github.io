- Post Title: Monster Hunter World models hepl

Hello, I wonder if someone could help me with my problem, I got some models of the game in steam, in .mdl format and pass to .obj
I understand that games with as much quality as this has the original model and one with fewer vertices because of the distance
My problem is that the models bring within themselves these models with fewer vertices, but the model is added to the original by the same vertices  
My question is, does anyone know how to separate the models? Or could someone help me do it?
