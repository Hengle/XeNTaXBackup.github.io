In case it will stop, I hope at least there will be a way to save all of the tools created, or it will be irreplaceable loss.

I would hate if the forum shut down. At the same time, I can't claim that I've used it for much personally, at this time. However, I simply haven't yet had another spree of trying to fiddle with anything I didn't understand since I signed up, is all. Once I started trying to tackle something relevant, I figured I would start to get a little active, and from there, onward, I figured I would come here every so often. If the forum does get discontinued, I would like to request that it at least stay up in archive mode. Everything here just disappearing would be a terrible loss.

I always check here when trying to mod games or look up obscure file formats. Do you know any similar forum if you ever closed? I would hate to see you go, used MultiEx quite a lot back in the day.
