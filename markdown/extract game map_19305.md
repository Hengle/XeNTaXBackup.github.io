- Post Title: extract game map

hello, i'm newbie
I am in need of extracting the game model. I am using Ninja Ripper. But I see it can only produce models in the view. I want the whole map model including architecture, trees, .. which software allows to extract the whole map ?? Thanks for reading

I don't want to play the devil's cock here, but you shall write concrete name of the game and if possible pack the maps and libraries (the one that are used to load the models, if there are none dlls then just the exe) or at least provide a download link.

You have to be specific in your issue, game name OS/console and such, more details.

NinjaRipper already extracts every geometry that the game has and if its compatible, modern games might not work that easy or at all, but as whole map, if your referring as exactly as it shows in-game with their coordinates in 3D space, then no software exists, it will simply extract every geometry it can but local(centered), that's it.
3D Ripper DX also works for older games, and it will extract what it sees in the viewport, but it will import every new draw extracted also locally(centered), but it will at least have coordinates in place for that specific draw.

Ninja Ripper only allows extracting people, objects, houses, etc. but does not allow the extraction of trees. I want to find a tool to extract both maps like 3D Ripper DX but it does not support directx 11
