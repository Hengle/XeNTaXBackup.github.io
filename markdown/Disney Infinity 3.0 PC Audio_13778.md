- Post Title: Disney Infinity 3.0 PC Audio

Hello everyone. I joined here as I am a modder.

I am posting this in regards to Disney Infinity 3.0 on PC. I require the audio files of a specific character. 

The Character is Kylo Ren from the new Star Wars The Force Awakens addon. 

The files of the game are a mystery to me and I doubt I even have the files necessary to rip the audio myself, and I have attempted to record the games audio while playing it with only the voice volume active, which worked, until the point the game crashed on me because the game has glitches, and always crashes in the same area, forcing me to be unable to progress with the recording.

If anyone can please help to extract the audio of Kylo Ren for me it would be a great help towards a Kylo Ren Mod I am making for Star Wars Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy PC game. Thank you for reading.
