Unity Version : 2017.4.23f1
Bundle Compression : 50 ?
Game Name : Seven Deadly Sins Grand Cross
File Type : UnityFS
Platform : Android

Sorry lack English X/..  

I need help to extract the Textures from .unity3D Archives.

File Name : cut_in_special_escanor_one_0007_01


I have tried using several Unity programs, but I am experiencing problems with extracting them at all.


uTinyRipper, UnityEX, AssetStudioGUI, bms... any more
But I failed, so I'll ask for help.

Can you tell me how you did the extraction method?
Have you figured out a solution?  Could you please let me know if you figured out a solution?
