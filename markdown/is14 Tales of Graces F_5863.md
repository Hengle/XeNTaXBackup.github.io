yeeeeeeeaaa......that BMS script is really really outdated.....in fact...it never even worked at all for me which is why we had to make a new extractor (hence NUBExt).

btw, not to sound like a dick or anything but, just post your questions on one forum, not xentax AND hcs64. we read both of them. I make myself feel silly by posting the same responses on both forums for the same questions.

Yea, but I prioritize. hcs64 is my biggest priority compared to here since I check it everyday (not 24/7 but at least 3-5 times a day) for any questions and stuff or issues with vgmstream that I can fix, etc. Over here, to me, is like: "hmm I have nothing to do/fix/add to vgmstream. maybe i should check out if there's anything over here for me to do or check out or ask a question of my own, etc." But certain things like NUB or anything related can be better dealt with over at hcs64 since that's where the tool originated from and support for vgmstream came from since manakoDE (manakoAT) and I are overseers of the tool's development and fixes.

  Well, if he doesn't mind can you send it to me?
