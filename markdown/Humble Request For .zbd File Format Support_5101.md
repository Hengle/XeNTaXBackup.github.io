- Post Title: Humble Request For .zbd File Format Support

Greetings All:

Just joined the community, and wished to make what is hopefully a humble request to add .zbd file format support ( either with Multi-Ex Commander or a similar utility ).  I've attached a sample .zbd file from the game MechWarrior 3.  General game info as follows:

Publisher:  Atari
Developer: Zipper Interactive
Genre:  Mech Sim
Released:  May 31, 1999

If anyone is already aware of a working utility for the .zbd format, please let me know.  Many thanks in advance.

background information about the format from [http://www.mech2.org/forum/viewtopic.php?p=2104#p2104](http://www.mech2.org/forum/viewtopic.php?p=2104#p2104) (mechwarrior 2 modding forum):

> New proprietary formats: ZBD, FLT, 555. ZBD's are archive file formats. Unlike MW2's PRJ, they don't have subfolders, instead, each file is a folder. Each ZBD has a different format, so I'm not really sure if this a real format or just an extension slapped onto a family of archive files. FLT files contain all geometry and information for a mech in one file rather than several WTB files and a BWD. The 555 files are uncompressed textures. In MW2, memory was scarce, so they used all compression technology available, but for MW3, that was apparently no longer neccessary.

MechVM (tool developed on that forum) is able to open SOME ZBD files and export 3d models (FLT format - details unknown to me), textures (some raw data format) and animations (no idea what format) but not all ZBD files.

hi, 
I have come across a tool/utility which might be of some help to you. 
TerranMechworks/mech3ax [https://github.com/TerranMechworks/mech3ax](https://github.com/TerranMechworks/mech3ax).
GameExtractor [http://www.watto.org/game_extractor.htm ... he%20game.](http://www.watto.org/game_extractor.html#:~:text=Game%20Extractor%20is%20a%20powerful,content%20used%20in%20the%20game.)

I know it's 12years late but hopefully, it might come in handy for someone else.
Also, I am trying to get assets out of the game "recoil" which is on the same engine, developer and has .zbd file format. All the information I have collected on it is in my post. [viewtopic.php?f=16&t=25256&p=183877&hilit=zbd#p183877](https://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=25256&p=183877&hilit=zbd#p183877)

cheers.
