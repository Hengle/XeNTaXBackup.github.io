Try to put an original Xenus model into game, it will works! But there is some error, but it works. So Maybe we can do something with the old Xenus 3ds plugnis I think.

I edited a simple model (an inventory one) with hex editor, as scheme of an old inventory model (from xenus) so I turned back the version of that model file, and in the RF2view it worked. But with more complex models like vehicles, characers, weapons it will be more difficult...
I think the most important thing is find a way how to edit the lv2 levels without level editor.
