You seem to be making lots of tools. Would you be able to add them to the Game File Format Central ? [http://wiki.xentax.com/index.php/Game_Tools](http://wiki.xentax.com/index.php/Game_Tools)

We could also host any of them at Xentax, just say the word and we'll upload them and give you a link. Have you've got a list what youve created so far?
