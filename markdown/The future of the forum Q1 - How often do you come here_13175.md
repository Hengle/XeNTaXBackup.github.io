"Just once, ever."
If you voted, this is your second time already, lol

Forgot the rest of the answers, sorry. Here you go.
Answer 2: 41
Answer 3: For know-how primarily (to learn) and user-made tools to extract/repack data files. I post my tools and findings rarely (I don't have that much time anymore.)
Answer 4: Absolutely. Why would you ask such a thing?
Answer 5: Give credit? I don't repost, I use the things I find here for my own amusement, so I am not sure where could I possibly give credit.

I was going to say the same thing. 
I had to check why I was even a member of this forum, and I still have not been able to figure it out. There must have been a topic that I was looking up in Google that brought me here at some point. And you probably have some sort of security on your forum that does not allow either the reading or downloading of info unless you are a member.

Question 1: How often do you come here? 

Also make sure to answer the following other questions:
Question 2: What age are you in years?
Older than 35 but younger than 45
Question 3: Why do you come here?
Can't remember... maybe that means I might be older than 45? JK
Question 4: Should the forum continue?
That's up to you
Question 5: Do you give credit to the forum?
No

I  used to be a moderator for a forum that went belly up, but we left the forums open because from time to time people do still post. And once and while we jump back in there. I'd leave it... if the people don't come, they don't come.

- Post Title: The future of the forum: Q1 - How often do you come here?

Question 1: How often do you come here? 
Every day or 2 I'd say.

Question 2: What age are you in years?
 28
Question 3: Why do you come here?
I'm a 3D Artist, professionally, but I'm still in my early years, I love to look at other games and think 'how did they do that?'. This forum enables me to find out how things were done and improve myself as an artist.

Question 4: Should the forum continue? 
I'd certainly say yes, its a bit quieter now than it used to be, and less of the games people are interested in catch my personal interests, but I think a lot of people still get something out of it.

Question 5: Do you give credit to the forum? 
I've never re-posted content elsewhere so I can't say I've ever given credit. Though I have redirected a few people here when they've asked about tools for games

Question 1: How often do you come here?
Only when i need some information about 3d file formats.
Question 2: What age are you in years?
31
Question 3: Why do you come here?
Question1
Question 4: Should the forum continue?
Yes, its not like it costs you a lot of money to maintain it. 
Webhosting, forum license, thats it. 
Time? well there are enough other people that can maintain it while you stay the owner.
Question 5: Do you give credit to the forum?
I send people here when i think they can find what they are looking for here
Question 6: Why didnt you use the poll to vote?
Because it doesn't allow me to really state my oppinion about it and only allows me to find a option that is closest to mine, but not quite it.

I intended to post and then do the polls, and as usual I completely forgot to take the official poll.

Also the answer for question 6 someone wrote below, is accurate.

That's why there is A. the open thread for open discussion, AND B. each topic with a question was also open to further elaborate?

1. once or twice a month

3. To mod games and figure out file formats and archives.
4. YES! Even if it's kinda dead/ slow, this would be the only place where people can go to talk about game file formats and archives.
5. Sure I guess. I never really say its from xentax but more from the people who made it FROM xentax, so yeah I guess I do.

It's a lot of time that i don't log-in in this forum so maybe i'm one of the last people who can talk about it but...
I've signed up in this forum almost 5 years ago... and it was one of the best things i've done!
My, i guess, greatest help in the community was "leading", if we can say so, the [MSET RESEARCH PROJECT](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=7069&hilit=MSET+research) and then, because i've a lot of business to do ahahah i did.t write a lot in other topic but i always, almost daily come here!
This forum represent best place where we can exploit the unexploitable so, if someone think of this forum like me the future of it is gorgeous so let's make it shine, let's make vene more famous tagn it is today As my project revealed:
Our Team Work can leads us everywhere 

Good Sunday to everyone, to the Community and to the Forum itself 

P.S:(I've answered the pool in the other link  )

Question 1: How often do you come here? 

When I was doing research on importing diablo3 formats, I'd say almost daily. But I didn't have much time since then, so that was some time ago. I do think the information in the forums is great and it would be missed if the forum would go. 

Also make sure to answer the following other questions: click on the links to move to the next poll topic
Question 2: What age are you in years?
38

Question 3: Why do you come here?
To find information, and contribute when I go beyond the level of available information. The kind of information and people found here is unique, if I have a question about fileformats, this is THE place I'd look.

Question 4: Should the forum continue?
Yes, definitely.

Question 5: Do you give credit to the forum?
I don't understand the question. I guess I never directly credit any forum, but appreciate the information that can be found on it and the exchange with like-minded people. I like it enough to take the time to fill in this poll, that should say something ^^

Q1:  I come here about once a week or so.  I used to visit more often, but my schedule recently has not afforded me the opportunities.
Q2: 30 years old
Q3: Mostly to see if there is a way to extract model data to mess around with. I used to be a papercrafter, and still would like to papercraft in the future, but the poly count of models grows higher and such things as decimation are limited to me in terms of knowledge and software capabilities.
Q4: I think the forum should continue, There is the delicate balance between allowing everyone to see the forum content and making things members only. I would like to think that people don't abuse the knowledge on the forum, but then again, I'm not THAT naive.
Q5: I've given credit to Mr. Adults and Xentax on my blog.  I've been a supporter of both, since I've learned about both resources.

Best,
   Lubdar
