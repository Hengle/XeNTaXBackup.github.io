- Post Title: Dead Space 3 Alien Red Marker model

Hello, I'd like to have the model of the Alien Red Marker you see in Dead Space 3 after you enter the place where the Alien Machine is located.

Or more spesifically this one: 

I have all the model, textures and everything here:
[https://www.dropbox.com/s/rpxi4z77mm6np ... r.rar?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/rpxi4z77mm6npc1/Alien%20Red%20Marker.rar?dl=0)

However, since the model is not spesified in any way, I do not know which one of those .geo files is the Marker, so unfortunatly you have to go through all of them.

The final results should be in .obj format as well as the textures in pretty much any format that work with the model format, maybe in .t4g as some ripped models of the game I have seen use that texture format.
