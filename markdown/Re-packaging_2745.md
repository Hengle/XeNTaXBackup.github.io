I've extracted some files from a .stuff file for Eve-Online. I've now got the file name of the sounds i'd like to edit to blank sounds and have files created to replace them.

How do i replace the files in the .stuff package with my own? Or how do i repackage them all and overwrite the old one?

Please explain exactly how you operate MultiEx Commander to extract files from these .stuff files.
