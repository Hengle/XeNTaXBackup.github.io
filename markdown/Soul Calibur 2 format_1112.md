- Post Title: Soul Calibur 2 format

I'm looking to make a custom version of SOul Calibur with retextured costumes, etc. I however have no idea as to how to decompress the file format, which seems obsencely arcane.

Help would be greatly appreciated.

Well, if you could send us a small example, or if it is too big, a small piece of a large file (the first 1MB and the last 1MB, using a good hex editor) that would be great. You can find my address at the bottom of [http://multiex.xentax.com](http://multiex.xentax.com) and mail watto at watto.org. 

Thanks!
