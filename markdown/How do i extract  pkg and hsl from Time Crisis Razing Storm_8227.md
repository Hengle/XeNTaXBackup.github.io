how much big is data.pkg in reality?
here if everything is correct it should be about 3.905.470.505 bytes (almost 4 gigabytes), is it right?

anyway the script for QuickBMS is the following:

I added automatic support for the PACK archives located in this archive (those containing the LZSS files)... oh well I was particularly inspired :)
