I'm trying to rip assets from Looney Tunes World of Mayhem, but I believe the data might be compressed in this extensionless file. The game itself is Unity powered, however, it's just the matter of getting into this file I have.

Perhaps a QuickBMS script might be able to handle it? Lemme know if anything's possible.
