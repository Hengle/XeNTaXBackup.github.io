Would you also be willing to post them at the Game File Format Central? [http://wiki.xentax.com](http://wiki.xentax.com) 

For instance, here for game specific tools: [http://wiki.xentax.com/index.php?title=Game_Tools](http://wiki.xentax.com/index.php?title=Game_Tools) 

And here for tools that process multiple games : [http://wiki.xentax.com/index.php?title=Extraction_tools](http://wiki.xentax.com/index.php?title=Extraction_tools)

Half the programs are Chinese...
With the Exception of Susie and the program that links to a .co.jp website...
The rest are Mainland Chinese programs.

hmm* If anyones interested i could always get to work on translating one of the japanese programs, i could do the chinese ones too but that would take me a lot longer as my chinese is pretty bad these days.

Just a heads up, RPG Viewer now has English support for non-Chinese users: [http://game.ali213.net/thread-1050275-1-1.html](http://game.ali213.net/thread-1050275-1-1.html)

It can be used to view and extract all kinds of assets, though it seems to work best on PC titles.
