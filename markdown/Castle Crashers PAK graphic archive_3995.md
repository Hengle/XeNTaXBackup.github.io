- Post Title: Castle Crashers PAK graphic archive

Hello folks, I have an urgent matter. I desperately need these archives unpacked but have searched relentlessly and have had no luck finding a method of doing so. It seems these types of files are used in all Behemoth games, such as Alien Hominid as well. I hope to have a real breakthrough with these files and hoepfully, for my comic purposes, I'll be able to utilize them properly.

Below is an example of the files.

This happens to be the most important file to me, and hopefully we can work together to extract it.

Do you mean the PAK file? That's a ZIP file. Use any zip archiver to unpack it.

A PAK file is a zip file? Is it really that simple?

What about the BREC file inside?

Yes. Just rename to .zip.

This presents a whole new problem though. The file within the PAK. I'm trying to extract the graphics and I'm hoping they'll be in an easier to access format after each is unpacked. The file inside is BREC as you see.
