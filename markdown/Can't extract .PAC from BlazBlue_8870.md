- Post Title: Can't extract .PAC from BlazBlue

Excuse-me, so I can't extract the files from BlazBlue Continuum Shift with Aluigi's QuickBMS with their arcsys.bms script. I'm in intent to extract the BBCS texts to make my translations, so everytime that I tried to extract any BlazBlue, Battle Fantasia or AH3 files the QuickBMS report-me an error message like:
"Error: the offset 0xa04d0700 in the file -1 can't be reached"

I'm using the leaked version of Taito TypeX co-op game, but the gr_johchu_eng.pac appear to be the same in PS3 and X360 versions.

Thanks
