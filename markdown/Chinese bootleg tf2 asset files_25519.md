- Post Title: Chinese bootleg tf2 asset files

So me and a friend found the files for the tf2 bootleg tittled "final combat" turns out nobody has a fucken clue how to crack its files (though it isint exactly GTA V or an anime tittie game) the modding community for TeamFortress2 could do with some new assets and hell maybe someone could make a server off it but enough rambling heres some details me and someone who modded psx games found.

-The archives for this game seem to be pretty compressed under a .pde file format
-The hex code has pauses of six zeros
-The servers have been shut down for the game in 2018
-Models have been GPU ripped in the past.

Thanks - so 迅雷游戏 is the top level directory and 大冲锋 is a child directory?
