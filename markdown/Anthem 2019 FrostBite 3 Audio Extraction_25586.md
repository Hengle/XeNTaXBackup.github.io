- Post Title: Anthem 2019 FrostBite 3 Audio Extraction

Hello , 
after finding my way toward Extracting Audio files for Observation 2019 game , i set it my goal to try with anthem until now i found literally nothing . managed to get .ebx and .chunks files from  music.sb / music.toc files uing NFS_heat scripts . but i still can't extract them to wave/ogg/mp3 format .




also tried to use frostbite 3 tools but it asks me for anthem encryption key if anyone know how to get one ??! 

P.S. Going to keep updating this thread and see how far  i can go with this thing.

ok there's another way but i still didn't test it if anyone wanna try it 

first download Frostbite editor [https://frostytoolsuite.com/](https://frostytoolsuite.com/)

if this version doesn't work download the 1.0.5.1 version from github .

after downloading the editor . open it and click *new* search for your game Path (Original Game fully updated not cracked and add it ) 

click *select*

the use the following serial if you are asked for encryption key : [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pVjnuJ ... sp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pVjnuJMhido3pROjGaOnyfIlzPmUp6SZ/view?usp=sharing)

it should log in to the game now and give you access to the tree structure of the game . look up the folder sound and check the sounds you want and export to *wav* 

a guy did extract 2 audios using this method not that i tired myself since i don't have the original game :/

sadly i wanted to just say that despite my attempts to learn some reverse engineering stuff to extract the audio files  i keep failing as it is not my field and take time to learn shit like this , and as in real life i'm busy so i can't really do anything , tried to use frosty editor but i need to extract thousand of files one by one which takes hours . people already extracted the models and terrains but sadly no one wants to do the audio .I hope in the future someone will make a full tool to dump the entire game fully .
