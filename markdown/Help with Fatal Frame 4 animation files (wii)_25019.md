- Post Title: Help with Fatal Frame 4 animation files (wii)

The files format is RSL, an specific type for Grasshopper Manufacture games, which I used an RSL extractor to be able to open it. The RSL is a container holding files for some specific function, such as models, textures, animations, etc.

I extracted one of the animation containers and the files are on a GAN format, I already searched for some program that can open it and the only one I've found is just a spreadsheet program. I don't know what to do with these files, can someone please help me? I can link the files here: [https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/ ... sp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-B1-AUWZsi_TBMW0ZQIELFWOVojVg3ic?usp=sharing) 
*(the GAN files are inside the "motion" folder)*
