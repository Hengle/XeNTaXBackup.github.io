Any idea how to extract these files? PAK is a pretty common file extension, used by a lot games, but the archive has many variations and therefore requires a different approach every time. (That's my take on it at least)  
So this must be another variation of some sort.

Please take a look.

A single sample file: eventcg_01.pak.rar (382 kb) [https://mega.co.nz/#!nEtmHL7R!APMWWSTV_ ... SSlQkgWO7I](https://mega.co.nz/#!nEtmHL7R!APMWWSTV_ehq2BWacQR670lEuNo7E3W-TSSlQkgWO7I)

It's a TGA (TRUEVISION-XFILE) image, just the header is changed.
Here your sample as png:

Great! So what should one do to make them viewable? 

There are several other similar Event CGs in PAK format, and that's what I'm really after. Please give some directions.

Just delete 5 bytes (in some hex editor) from the start and save it as .tga.
