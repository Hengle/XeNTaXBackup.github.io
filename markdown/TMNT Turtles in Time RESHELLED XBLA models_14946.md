- Post Title: TMNT: Turtles in Time RESHELLED XBLA models

Hey folks! I'm in need of a bit of help -- I've managed to unpack the contents of the XBLA TMNT: Turtles in Time .bf archives, but I'm completely out of my depth when it comes to making heads or tails of the contents. I've tried downloading a bunch of .bin unpackers associated with Ubisoft's file formats, but none have been successful, so I've attached a sample to [THIS LINK](https://mega.nz/#!HNhkWazQ!spj86FRbvUz2vaJdwu4DMA6BXigj8RZ_bTYf4GkFW18). I'm not sure how these correlate to the character related files, but there doesn't appear to be any form of texture formats in the archives, so I'm assuming they're locked away in these bin files. The other thing is that the .mdl formats aren't compatible with NOESIS, and there are some strangely titled ones that make me think they've done their own thing with the format somehow. I've attacked a few more samples, so hopefully someone can makes heads or tails of what is going on in these: [BAXTER STOCKMAN](https://mega.nz/#!fJZTkboD!UHW2XZQF0uIHAp5xw-2YdHCRnHTnI-BZOpIYnhSh1dc)'s related files. Here's what appears the be[Shredder's .mdl file](https://mega.nz/#!GAA3lZDR!Wg6V-uQqYp3CpvPbUO996nFNFMgNk_EbFV7ZbO8bsn4), too, if that helps... 

Thanks guys!
