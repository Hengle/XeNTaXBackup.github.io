Tool for Disneyland Adventures.

Drop OVL file onto the tool. OVS file must be in the same folder (if present)
This will extract all models & textures from package.

There is no appropriate smiley in here to accurately depict what I am feeling right now!
Imagine me, dancing across my room in a bunny PJ. Because that is what is happening.

Thank you so incredibly much, Deamon!!! I can't thank you enough, really.
I shall now rush and grab these beautiful Disney-Babies.

THANK YOU!!

Hey there, been trying out the tool but it doesnt seem to be fully working. Tried extracting Tomorrowland stuff, and got 

"Unhandled Exception: System.IndexOutOfRangeException: Index was outside the bounds of the array.

Hello daemon1,

I want to thank you so much for the work you put into making it possible to extract from this game~

I've been wanting a tool to enable this for a long time. I'm a super prominent VR community content creator for the game VRChat (it's a hobby of mine), which allows anyone to make worlds/avatars for thier game that people can explore in VR.

I really really want to bring the world of Disneyland Adventures into VRChat so me, my friends, and a  bunch of the community can explore Disney together in Virtual Reality.

I know most tool developers usually just care about making sure characters can export, and then move on from there. But I'd suuuuuper appreciate it if you could get the tool to work for the environments as well. Me and my good friend here Flashfire, are super talented at Unity and converting assets and building worlds to be Virtual Reality experiences in VRChat, and I can tell you that we'd be able to do a fantastic job porting the assets into an explorable world in VR. So yeah, we'd super appreciate any help in the ability to export environments!

Thank you~
EvolvedAnt

You know, current tool exports environment props too.

Hey Daemon, thank you so much, the ability to export props is super useful~
For the environments I have resorted to using another tool. It's not as awesome, and leaves a ton of work, but it's now doable and your exports are super helpful for the characters and props! Thank you so much!

Kilik, I don't know how to export sounds, but you can turn off the ingame sound fx's and voice, to record the music, or turn off music and sound fx's to record the voices, etc. It's not perfect, but it's something!

I use NinjaRipper to rip the environments while the game is running, however what you get is hundreds of individual parts of the environment, mixed in between thousands of exports, with the UV's all messed up on many of them, and the import not accepting the right textures, plus normals flipped, and the model inverted, etc, etc.

So it's a TON of work to fix everything for environments, but with your tool at least the characters, props, etc, are really exported perfectly with the correct textures, UV's, etc. So using your tool for those, and ninja for environments.

I've been looking for someway to do this since the game was release. Like others I've resorted to ninjaripper to pull out all the environments, but it's a painful and slow process. I can't say how much I appreciate the work you've done.

Bumping for this. The tool works great for props and characters but it can't rip the environment stuff.

Have you been able to rip the parade stuff? The program doesn't seem to be working for me on the floats.

I tried running the latest revision of the tool but while it did get Snow White it's missing her skirt wtf?


Am I missing something or is it because of the tool itself? As I've tried it on Aurora and a few others and they came out intact.

I can't get a lot of the stuff to rip. I ripped a lot of props but no models of the haunted mansion itself for instance

Apologies for the necropost! Was wondering if anyone has found a more efficient way to rip the map from this game without having to resort to Ninjaripper or 3DM. I have also tried Cobra Tools, and although it's being updated there hasn't been much on the mesh side of things. Would appreciate anything, thank you!

24 basic models is not nearly "all of the characters" but at least you knew how to get them, I'm struggling to get just the 3 Brers
