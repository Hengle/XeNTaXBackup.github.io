I'm interested in converting a couple MC2 PS2 textures to the PC .TEX format, however, is it possible to convert the .PAL textures?
Here they are:

Just because many people viewed the thread that doesn't mean anyone can help you with this.
If there is something for that format you will be able to find it via the search or google.
If not then someone will have to write something for it and that normally takes quite some work.

Google is useless. PAL format games? Fuck the format, I'M LOOKING FOR THE TEXTURE FORMAT FFS.
Found this opening one with Notepad, however.
"RIFFË†  PAL data    "
