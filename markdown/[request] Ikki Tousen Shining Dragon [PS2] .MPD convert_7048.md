(First,Sorry for my poor English.　I hope you'll understand.)
Can you seen "image.cvm" in gamefiles?
this file open by binary editer.
cut off 6144byte from fileshead (hex00000000-00001800) ,and save as "image.iso"
"image.iso" open by disk mount tools.
You will be able to extract it from "image.iso". 

some other consumer game's "*.cvm" will be able to be extracted in a similar way.

I somehow understand a bit 
So by binary editer do you mean hex editor or something?
And the disk mount tools, daemon will work right?

Did you do the method that had been my post or Apache3? 
If you use my method, You can see "MODEL" folder in mounted virtual drive.

I rest assured that best effort will be made to you will can convert models.
I will never forsake you.

I tried opening image.cvm with apache3 but I can't extract it, and with the method you said, I didn't understand the part "cut off 6144byte from fileshead (hex00000000-00001800) ,and save as "image.iso""
How do I cut off 6144 byte?

Ohkeeyy.
I explain as comprehensible as possible in some images
. 
You have hex editor,right? (i wrote "binary editor".)
Open "image.cvm" with your hex editor.
Then, you see it like this.
(some old hex editors can not open as too much big file.)


And now,
Plz select hexs from hex#0000000 to hex#00001800.


Cut it!


Now, save as an other name, "image.iso".
I suggest that you do not overwrite as same file name.


If u can not understand my word, Please PM to me,

Hmm that's interesting I thought all PS2 formats were big-endian?

EDIT: lol fatduck's importer already supports this game.

Doesn't look like there are any VIF tags and everything's little endian.

I've extracted the contents of the .cvm file and I noticed that the SOUND folder has some playable ADX audio files and some unplayable AHX (voice) files, I downloaded a few tools/plugins that claimed to be able to play/convert that format with no success, anyone familiar with the AHX sound format?

The main purpose of this tool is analyzes some Japanese H.......H*tai game for Japanese peoples.
(I think truly that Japanese people likes hent*i! Well...so am I )

That project was terminated. 
Probably the latest version cannot be confirmed.
However, it was revitalized by some Chinese volunteer.
