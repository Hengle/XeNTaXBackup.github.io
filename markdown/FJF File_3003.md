- Post Title: FJF File

I was recently taking a look at Saint Seiya Sanctuary Chapter for PS2 then I extracted some files from the AFS file.
I'm sure that these files handle 3D data and/or 3D animation data.

I understand only the top of the file,but need a help:

```
char {3}     - Flags()
char           - ???  (always 64)

```


As seen I didn't find neighter 1% of the file format,if somebody can help me x)
Here is the hex code from a NULL FJF file:

```
