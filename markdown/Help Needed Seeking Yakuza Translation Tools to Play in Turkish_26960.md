- Post Title: Help Needed: Seeking Yakuza Translation Tools to Play in Turkish

Hello friends,

I'm a Turkish gamer and a huge fan of the Yakuza series. I'm looking for translation tools to play the game in my native language. If anyone has access to the Yakuza language files or translation tools, could you kindly assist me?   

My goal is to play Yakuza Like a Dragon in my own language and to share this experience with gamers in my country. If you can give me access to language files or translation tools, I will collaborate with translation enthusiasts in Turkiye to make this happen

If you have any knowledge or resources related to Yakuza translation tools or relevant sources, please feel free to share them with me.

Thank you!   ((I just learned that there are a lot of texture files, as I found out from my friend. Despite being ignorant about these matters, I still wanted to give it a try. If you consider this topic irrelevant, you can delete the post.))
