wont work with ogg headers properly, you can try the one for planetside2, but it only does the first file in an fsb, can't handle multiple audio streams in one .fsb
this might be adpcm, but it doesn't decode properly that way in aezay's either

Mmkay. If I could dig up the FSB extractor I wrote and tidy it up I'lll release it. Though I'm not sure if it'll read FSB5 properly, since I don't think there's a public header with its structure in it.
