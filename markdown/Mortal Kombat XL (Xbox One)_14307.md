Hi,

I like to reverse MK games make soundtracks or access character renders, MKX was easy to reverse with the tools out there using the easily accessible PC Files. But when they Launched MKXL It had new Characters from Kombat Pack 2 and a New stage that are not present in MKX, but they did not release this content on PC. This left me having to try get this data from the Xbox One or PS4 versions. Both seem to post a challenge when it comes to getting the raw data from the disc, but with my Pioneer BDK-205BK Bluray drive, it was able to read the Xbox One version of MKXL. But the data on disc is archived. So the .xxx files are not accessible. I am hoping someone can take a look at one of these archives and make some sort of dumper to extract the content. Here is a screenshot of whats on disc and I will upload one of the skin archives.

Thanks in advance for any help or replies.

It is not possible to decrypt Xbox One games yet. As a result, this thread serves no purpose and will be locked.
