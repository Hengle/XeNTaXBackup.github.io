- Post Title: Tiberium Wars .cdata

I gather that the music for this game is locked somewhere in GlobalStream.big. When I extract the data using any n all the big extractors, i get a whole lot of .cdata files. Somewhere in there are encrypted .mp3s, since Fraunhofer is credited in the game's credit roll. Is there some kind of converter/decompressor that will support this, esp now that the original format was identified???
