I hope someone is clued up on the game and can help;

The nudity is blurred,I believe in keeping with the Sims.Has anyone worked out how to overcome this?The game is marketed as an 'Adult' game.Whats the point,anyway...

Theres a method to import pictures .i.e. Glassdrops into the game.How do you do that .i.e. which folder does one drop the picture/s into?

Any help will be appreciated.

Cheers.

This thread can be closed.Its sorted but I gotta deduce from the zero response that this game either has no fan base,or the clued up guys of the game dont log into this site.That sucks,anyway...
