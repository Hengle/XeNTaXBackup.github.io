- Post Title: (Xbox) Godzilla Destroy All Monsters Melee - Samp Files

I've been attempting to extract sound effects from the Xbox version of Godzilla Destroy All Monsters Melee. I've looked all over the internet for a way to extract these files and came across a program called ekszbox-abx, which works perfectly with the Xbox version of Godzilla Save The Earth but does not work with Godzilla Destroy All Monsters Melee because there are no Uber files to go with the samp files. Ekszbox-abx requires both the uber files and samp files.

Does anybody else know of any way to extract these samp files?

GSTE Sounds, for reference: [http://www.mediafire.com/download/zwo5h ... Sounds.rar](http://www.mediafire.com/download/zwo5h7uz7i5uaem/GSTESounds.rar)

Any help is greatly appreciated!
