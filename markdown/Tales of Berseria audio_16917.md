- Post Title: Tales of Berseria audio

Could someone please help me with extracting audio files from Tales of Berseria?  I'm new to this, and have successfully used quickbms to extract a bunch of files, but they are all .dat files and now I'm not sure what to do with them.
Trying to find specific audio files to use as notification sounds on my phone.

Thanks in advance.
