Toji no Miko's files are all stored within a folder in the regular Android storage, Android/data/com.square_enix.android.googleplay.TojinomikoTomoshibi/files/UnityCache/Shared, you can use Asset Studio to open them. I would recommend using the "Load Folder" option with the Shared folder, because past that is a sea of folders (7000+) with one singular asset bundle in them.

And where do I get the asset study, I don't know how to use it, can I save the files in FBX or OBJ?

You can find it through Google, it should be the first thing that pops up when you type "unity asset studio". It can export both.
