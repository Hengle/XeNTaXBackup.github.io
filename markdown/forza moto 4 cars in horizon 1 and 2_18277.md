- Post Title: forza moto 4 cars in horizon 1 and 2

Hi , i extracted all the fm4 cars rigged all the tables in the db put the fm4 shaders etc etc etc ...the game boot fine and the cars appear in game but i have a problem with the collisions as the cars slide under the map and fall down.

anyone have any idea how to fix it? i think the solution is in the .col file, what software can i use to open and edit that???

secondly: anyone know of a way to decompress forza carbin and create custom ones?

any help would be greatly appreciated
