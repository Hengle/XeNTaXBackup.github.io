- Post Title: Custom Cast - model export, need help

Hello. I'm very new to this forum and also have minimum knowledge on how to export stuff. I've been looking at this game called Custom Cast. It's a mobile game and as far as I know it's made with Unity. I was able to open most of the files with assetstudio, however I could not find any of the models for clothing, bodies etc, everything in there was either textures or other stuff and I'm unsure what to do to be able to access the models and need help. I can provide files. As of writing this I'm not sure what to provide so if anyone asks for something, I will provide it.
