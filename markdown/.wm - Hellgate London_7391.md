- Post Title: .wm - Hellgate London

I'm trying to get at the character models in Hellgate: London. I've unpacked the archives with Unhell and can import the weapon (.am) files with AmCollada. The character models, however, are in working model .wm format. I can't figure out how to import them (not to mention my computer thinks they're windows media audio/video). 

Any help would be appreciated. I can upload a few samples if you need something to work with.

I've had some limited success extracting the Hellgate models. Here's the four helmets I've gotten...



When using amCollada to convert the .wm files to .dae, it crashes though. I can't figure out why it works on rare occasions with only a few files. Any help would be appreciated.

Sorry for reviving an old post.

Does anyone still have a copy of AmCollada?
