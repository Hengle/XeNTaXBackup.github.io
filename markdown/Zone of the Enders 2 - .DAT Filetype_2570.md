- Post Title: Zone of the Enders 2 - .DAT Filetype

*EDIT*

Ah sorry to have wasted space but it seems I just found this site:

[http://elektr1k.com/zoe/music/zoe2/](http://elektr1k.com/zoe/music/zoe2/)

They seem to have what I was looking for. Thanks anyway. Maybe I hlped you add the game to the list of things to add so yeah.

Hello I would like to request that MultiEx has support with the Playstation 2 game Zone of the Enders 2.

I did a bit of research before posting and I found this:

> I've gotten far enough with Cube Media Player to know the tracks I'm interested in are the .\ZOE2\VOX.DAT. However when I try to play them, they're always garbled and experimenting with the interleaves and offsets doesn't do any good. I have downloaded the CRC utility, but have little idea of how to proceed.

The interesting bit is the 'Cube Player' which I assume allows one to explore the file. However their site is dead.

Anyway this fan site here: [http://www.genesoul.net/zoe/](http://www.genesoul.net/zoe/) says:

> Files sections updated with 4 tracks from the "ZOE2 Complete" soundtrack. ZOE2 Complete is basically a custom music rip I did awhile back when ZOE2 was first released. I'll be uploading more tracks to Fileplanet over the course of the holidays. Enjoy!

I tried to contact the man and I recieved no reply but the site was made in 2003 so I assume he left.

Now before you tell me there is an OST... I already know but the OST didn't include a particular song that is only in the limited edition.

To help you the file structure appears to be the same as that in MGS2:

This is the file: E:\zoe2\vox.dat - You can download it here off my site:

*Currently uploading - Time left: 2:36:02 - I will update post later. 

*Edit* Ehehe techincal hitch...I'll upload tommorow >_<

Thanks for reading.
