- Post Title: 武术世界 (.ypak)

Hello! I had some models of this game in my old drive, but surprisily the game is up yet, I have downloaded the game but i their format was change and I'm searching a way to open this .ypak files but still not got it, the file seems compressed but could be partially encrypted too, tried with sqlitebrowser due the header, but only got the file paths of the models (.mod)  . I'm attaching a sample if someone can take a look would be awesome, anyways thanks for your time.
