- Post Title: Splinter Cell 3D (3DS) .bf archive: how to rip models

Greetings, everyone!

I've recently been tinkering around with the 3DS "Remaster" of Chaos Theory and stumbled upon some interesting formats I haven't seen before. Hopefully, this will allow for 3D model extraction and we'll finally get our hands on the Chaos Theory models (Since nobody has been able to rip any models from the PC version of Chaos Theory or even XBOX or PS2 for that matter). The file I found is under a .bf format and it's approximately 282 MB, too large to upload here, so I uploaded it to my Dropbox for download so we can figure out what kind of files lie within. 
I've really been looking forward to ripping the wetsuit model of Sam and even some enemy NPC models and even weapons from the game and port them over to Garry's Mod.
I'd say it'd be a blast from the past and it'd open a whole new realm of possibilities for people looking forward to modding and porting.
Thank you for your attention, and I'm looking forward to your replies!  


As promised, here's the link with the file: [https://www.dropbox.com/s/bcq0wgp17jelawy/SC3.bf?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/bcq0wgp17jelawy/SC3.bf?dl=0)
