- Post Title: Unlocking developer features in CoD: Modern Warfare 3 (2011)

In-game console and developer features are disabled permanently in Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 (2011), even if I use IDA or Cheat Engine. Are there ways to unlock the console and hidden developer features, such as cg_fov?

Thanks.
