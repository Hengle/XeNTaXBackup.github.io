You know, with all this PS4 Extraction Plugins coming out (Bloodborne, Until Dawn, Final Fantasy XV), I was wondering if a "Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy" was on the making too? Probably somebody already thinked about this tho.

Bush, today they announced that this game will come to PC, Xbox One and Switch in July.
Will you wait for them to release the PC Version or you will keep going with your script?

Pretty happy about that news btw, probably this new versions of the game have the rumored "Spyro HD Remake" demo.

Sounds nice. Can't wait for the final script to come out soon, I would love to port stuff from the game to XPS.

Since there hasn't been an update for about 10 months, is anyone willing to work on it?
Texture ripping is possible thanks to this tool [https://gamebanana.com/tools/6551](https://gamebanana.com/tools/6551) hopefully extracting models could be possible.

I'd be willing to pay someone to create a max script that can import these models into Max, fully rigged, with textures.
