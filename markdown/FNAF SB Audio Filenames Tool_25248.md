- Post Title: FNAF SB Audio Filenames Tool

The developers of Five Nights At Freddy's Security Breach were nice enough to leave the Wwise SoundbanksInfo.xml metadata in the game files, so as per a request I wrote a little program that uses it to give extracted audio readable filenames and in some cases subfolders.

HOW TO USE: Get the SoundbanksInfo.xml from your game, then place it next to the FNAFAudioTool.exe alongside the .wav files you want to rename, then run the program.

EDIT: It has come to my attention that bnnm's Wwiser tool can already do this exact same thing while actually extracting the files. 

Oh well, whatever, I already spent the effort, might as well keep this up. Just in case someone wants the renaming as a standalone thing.
