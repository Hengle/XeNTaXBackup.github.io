Does anyone know a way to convert the .3d model files in the Dos game SkyNet into something useful? 
The game was a sister of Daggerfall of sorts, both used Bethesda's Xngine.

I'm planning a remake of type thing and kinda need those models to continue lol even if just for reference.

Yep that's the game, It uses sprites for weapons and other little details but a lot of the game uses 3D models for enemies, vehicles, ect.
I've manged to get all the sprites, Just them damn models that baffle me.

I learned convert the .3d model files in the SkyNet to OBJ 3d format no textures!

Yeah these would be cool to rip. Maybe using hex2obj may help, but it's gonna be tough

Taking a look at it with hex2obj, it appears that the models do not have normal face indices, but I am still a bit of a noob so take my words with a grain of salt.
