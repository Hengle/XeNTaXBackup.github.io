I think he's wanting a script.More exactly: he wants  a script "to reimport obj to fmlb"! 

Seven years ago, fmlb to obj:

Usually I use my Make_obj ('C') project 'cause I hate python scripts somehow.  
(I could give it a try some day when Durik doesn't care for fmlb.)

Thank you very much. I can also export it to fmlb since otherwise I will never be able to modify the game?

true once they told me that to export it is impossibleExport obj to fmlb is a hard thing as conversion always is from .obj to any_3D_format.
Believe it or not. Search the forum for such conversions - you won't find thus many.

Truth is that you usually need to know the meaning of (nearly) every byte (Word, DWORD) in an fmlb file.
If you understand one sequence wrong the games usually will crash with your modded asset.

I didn't try it with .fmlb but
one approach (for static meshes) could be to MODIFY an existing fmlb file. Copying vertices and face indices from an .obj file into it.
Condition: vertex count should be identical. (Face index count might be lower, but not higher, but you need to find and adjust the face index count value in the file then.)

This applies to static meshes only because for npcs (they have skinning) this simple approach won't work.

aa those are from version 1.039 I think you can imagine that shakotay2 has all the fmlb files
for example to SylvesterMaster! that's the original sylvestre you have called SylvesterJunionMaster!
I think it's a sylvestre that comes out of the mailbox in the game I know a lot about it xd I wish shakotay2 had them all

I'm not interested in this game nor it's models. All I'm doing here is 15 min jobs to show some meshes.

Believe it or not. This is my last post in this thread, thanks.

Thanks bro, you are a genius with this information that you just gave me. I know that the game may possibly download the fmlb files  little by little as you progress, you the master, I don't know how I can thank you
