God_Eater_Burst_USA PSP dos tool

How to:-This tool will extract & repack the pmf,at3,gim,gmo,vag files from package.rdp 743 MB in total

1.Extract the ripkit folder (with winrar) & put your package.rdp into the same folder(extracted with UmdGen) and run the Run_me.bat and press 1,This will then extract the files to an extracted folder. 
2.Then downsample or modify your files but keep the same name, if the files are bigger it will not be added.If the files are smaller this tool will pad out to the original size.
3.Run the Run_me.bat and press option 2 this will then inject the files back in!!Remember the file will be the same size as the original(Put the package.rdp back in using UmdGen or WQSG_UMD_R31)
4.When you cso your iso it will be smaller!!


many thanks to Gnie and skybladecloud for the tools

mind to help us create the package.rdp tool for the God_Eater_Burst_JAP PSP too?
i wanna create undub version of the game,
any suggestion on how to do it? which file should i replace?
i've tried using u'r 
God_Eater_Burst_USA PSP package.rdp  tool to extract the package.rdp
and found few different extension files
.PMF extension files
.GMO extension files
.GIM extension files
.AT3 extension files and
.VAG extension files

i've tried replace the files on it..
but somehow after i pack it back to ISO, the game hanged at opening movie,
but if i didnt bother with PMF extension, it worked, just until title screen, and then hanged..
i hope i didnt bother u, and would u mind to lead us on how to replace the files?
best regards
