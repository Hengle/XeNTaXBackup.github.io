- Post Title: Disaster Report 3 .GMO

Hi, I was looking into the files from this game and i notice that the characters .GMO have the header CMPS instead of the normal OMG, i try deleting the extra header but it did not work. Can someone please help me.

assumed to be compressed data - you could try a "brute force" comtype_scan (Aluigi) with 100s of compression types.

see here for example:

Hi there, thanks for the reply i just finish testing this method but it didn't work. This time i am attaching an uncompressed .GMO from the game for compare(in the game the clothes are uncompress but the characters and the maps are compress) . Maybe someone can make a script for it.
