- Post Title: COMMISSION: MDL conversion with Rigging;

Hey guys, I was hoping to commission someone write a script that will convert these models with original rigging. I would rather it be a Noesis, Autodesk 3DS one or the kind that Daemon does. I'm more than happy to discuss any amount you want, which is fair. I do however have a few stipulations:

  1 ) I can only afford $25AUD( Roughly $17USD ) a fortnight. So once we've agreed on an amount and with proof of completion, I'm willing to pay the amount in $25( AUD ) installments until paid off. After which, I will get the Plugin.

  2 ) This will be through Paypal;

  3 ) As I am paying for this with my own money, the plugin IS NOT to be released to the general public.

  4 ) I've uploaded a number of different models from the game, so hopefully this is a once off thing. If after receiving the plugin, and everything works fine, but I need an update, I will be more then willing to pay another amount for your services.

  5 ) I can already get the Models as .OBJ, so no need to bother with that.

If you're happy with these terms or have any questions, PM me so we can make arrangements. I hope to hear from you guys and hope we can do business together.

Thanks for letting me know mate, I've uploaded them to one of my onedrive accounts, hopefully this works.

well... i got somewhere. meshes and weighted stuff. the bone locations are not there yet and the bigger meshes crash it. it also extracts all lods at once. this information has to be found yet. if you can handle blender and mess with the uv editor you could extract the lods by uv density.

"not release to public" my butt. take the chewing gum. maybe learn something and finish it before i wake up again. gn

Thank you..

Mate, you got further then somewhere. I didn't even realize there were LODS. You're a bloody legend, and this is epic as is. I'm going to be honest, this is way out of my scope, which is why I chose to commission someone to do it for me.

I hope this next part doesn't come off the wrong way, as I'm trying to be respectful and polite as I can:
Given that this game is a MMORPG, which in all honesty contains Faces, Bodies, Enemies, Bosses, a whole range of different meshes. It will be a time consuming endeavor. In my original post, I stated I was willing to do multiple payments of $25( AUD ) a fortnight which means I'm willing to fork out a nice fair sum. I am more then happy to pay for this. I'm not going to beat around the bush, theoretically if you paid for a $50+ for a feed, would you be willing to give just as much to every yahoo that comes along? I want this for myself, so I can post the models on my website and I will pay you for this if it's kept between us mate. The alternative is you do it for free. What's a little extra green in the kitty going to hurt mate!

I'm currently commissioning an artwork from a user on DA, and here is a screenshot of our conversation. As you can see by this one screenshot, I'm fair, and I'm willing to take a screenshot of the 2 payments I've made. Just got 1 and a half left to go.


Sorry for ranting mate, but this is a massive project I am willing to back for my website. I hope you can understand where I'm coming from.

Thanks again, and hopefully we can do business in the future!

EDIT:Could I ask how long it took you to do this much of the plugin mate?

well... it took 6.5 hours. tbf it's slow but that's the process crosstesting multiple files and debugging constantly. evolving code as i figure things out. i'm not even sure it really has lods. the buffer is still read wrong, kinda. i hate python buffers. i'm always having trouble with split buffers. gotta re-do api calls to get somewhere. but the syntax and functions don't allow it. ugh...

and... i'm fine doing this for free. a lil brain teaser in quarantine (not infected but self proclaimed). you can keep the coins. it's aight.

6.5 hours, f**k me. I assumed it would take a few hours, but 6+ and sounds like you gotta start again. The commission( Display Pic above ) I've currently got, I finish paying off this week, and he / she has been happy with the fortnightly payments. I tried learning this, but I got nowhere myself. I tried the plugin with other models and it worked for a majority of the outfits, except one glove mesh. The hair meshes worked as well, but the faces didn't. I've uploaded the error files to my onedrive incase you want to have a look. Also, I realized I have made a huge error, I never actually read the files until I was browsing through them. There was a skeleton file just under the filename, so I've uploaded new files in their original heirachy. I can't afford it this week, but I'd like to pay you at least the $25( AUD ) in 2 weeks, on Friday 13th November( AEST ). I know you said you don't want money, and believe it's your right to say no, but 6 and a half hours mate + my epic screw up is the least I can do. Sorry about this and thank you again.

Ain't nothing wrong with staying home during these dark ages. At least you're not one of those "COVID DUN EXIST" going out and getting everyong infect. Good on you mate.

Sorry again, that's definitely my bad!

got it stable to process each file. exports the lods correct and manages the big bozo file (note it seems to freeze, but does it). materials are temporary, bones work for mesh0... kinda... but are not remapped for the rest yet, nor in hierarchy nor named correct at all. i gotta read some japanese first to learn what is what.



more soon. gotta chill some and take a nap. cheers 

additive. commented wip script. anybody reading this thread can join and help figure out the bone data and remapping. this data looks like a mess to me rn.

Mate, that is so awesome. I've tested it with other MDL's and there ain't no errors. Excluding weapons of course. I wish I could do more to help, and I hope someone else decides to give you a hand. Thanks!

BUMP

Looks like Episoder has called it quits. I'm still willing to honour my COMMISSION terms based in the original post to anyone who is willing to finish the plugin. I've uploaded weapon models as they're not supported by the plugin created so far by Episoder.

I would much rather not, as I would want this game + rigging to be specifically for my website. If any user is willing to complete the plugin with rigging and show proof, I would be more then happy naming the game as well as start making payments for it. Still requires the stipulations in the original post.

Episoder, I still owe you mate

I've had a look at it as well.  I can get the weapon models to work too.  It might be handy to have some of the textures to experiment with, for completeness.

Glad to hear you've made progress mate. I've re uploaded all the source files with their textures, I can't wait to see what you do. Thanks for helping, it means a lot.

I've managed to have a bit more of a look at it as time allows.  It's far from complete though.  Some models don't seem to have complete textures, so I'm not sure what's going on there.  This is an example of one of the weapons, with diffuse/specular/normal textures applied.

That's epic mate, great job. The game itself, uses the colour maps / shaders as the models are used for different weapons. Here's a picture of what model W2301b0040.mdl looks likewith shading:


As per this being a commission, I'm willing to pay you for what you've done so do you mind if I get your paypal account, so I can make a payment today please? and how much would you like? Also, you wouldn't happen to know how to complete the rigging would you?

Also I'm waiting for Episoder to return so I can request his Paypal as well.

I don't have Paypal, but I'm not looking for payment - just a hobby/challenge for me, so I wouldn't ask for anything.

I'm not sure about the rigging stuff yet - I'll still have a tinker with it to see if I can make sense of it.  I think the mesh stuff is fairly complete though, apart from working out some textures.

I think there are other tools for this game out there though, although I've not got any to work due to them needing the full game files.

I can understand doing it for the challenge mate. If you do however want a few coin in your kitty in the future, let me know. Those blasted textures aye. I will PM you the title of the game, so hopefully you will get a better understanding of what's what. You're correct, there's a tool I use which does pretty much everything this plugin does and more, which is why I keep bitching about the rigging, sorry. Hopefully this helps, also note: The game has a free version.

To be honest mate, I based this on a commission, so I'm just trying to hold up my end of the bargain. From now on I won't offer any money unless specifically asked for it. Thanks for getting back to me. DON'T APOLOGIZE MATE, after everything you've already done. I understand everyone has their own lives to live, and I'm happy waiting until people are ready to what they can with this project. Just gonna quickly send you the same message as DKDave, as it may help.

well. i fixed some more models loading. weapons and some stage and miscellaneous items. edit: -snip- loads pretty much everything just fine now. materials index soon. rigging a bit later. i'm good for today.  

and well... loading the skeleton files from this folder structure is a no go, really. i can't backtrack the folders to get to the skelly files. there are no file strings in the files. the pathes and structures are inconsistent as well. i got no clue howto automate this. i could do it with file strings in the scripts. yes. that's pretty shitty tho.

also... this explorer tool is kinda useless to me. what does it actually manage todo? does it do skeletons and rigged stuff? i dunno. i don't have the game data structure. maybe you could ask the author to incorporate the parts of the script into this tool. i'd figure if they can parse the game data from the root, they'd have a easy way to get rigged characters done if they can link the skelly and mesh files, somehow.
