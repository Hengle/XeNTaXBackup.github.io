hi. have anyone looked into tdu2 encryption ?
im interested in savegames mostly, but i think that all files use same encryption.

probably I will work on this because there are good chances that only the keys are different than the first TDU for which I wrote the decrypter.
maybe in the meantime upload one of these savegame

*edit*
for the moment I have checked the encryption function and it's perfectly the same, included the keys.
the problem is that yesterday when I tried to decrypt the savegame of a friend the result wasn't good so there is for sure something else to do.

yes i am also waiting on this!
i tried to change my online name, but it says savegame is corrupt, obviously there is something in decrypted savegame files specifiying the name too!
