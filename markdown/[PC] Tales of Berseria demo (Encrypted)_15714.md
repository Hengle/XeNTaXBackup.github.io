It seems that it is different from the old *.TLDAT.

Sorry for the noob question, just getting into this scene. How can you tell it's decrypted if it still looks jumbled up?

I was able to dump the english script with this. Trying to dump the JPN script from the PS3 game with this. It looks like it supports decrypting the TOFHDB, so i commented out lines using TOFHDA but i cant get it to complete successfully.

Hello!

I followed a guide on another forum to extract the files of this game, so now I've got all these folders full of extracted files. I don't really know where to go from there to turn those into images. I'm basically looking for all the character cut-ins and art and such.
