- Post Title: Vanguard files

Hello all.  I want to extract the mesh and texture files from Vanguard.  I know they use Unreal, and I tried to export files using the game extractor tool from Watto, but they end up being files like  .STATICMESH, .SKELETALMESH or .TEXTURE.
Is there something available I should look into to look at theses?

Thank you
