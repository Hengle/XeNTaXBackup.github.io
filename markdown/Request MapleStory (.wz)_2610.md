- Post Title: Request: MapleStory (.wz)

Hello.
Can you add support for the archive file for MapleStory? The file extension is .wz . The link to the game is [http://www.maplestory.com](http://www.maplestory.com) (select your country, if not, global). It's a big game, and you need to register on the site.

The file that was cut by FileSplitter is herre.
