Name: Uncharted - Drake's Fortune Text Tool V1.0 
System: PC - Windows xP SP3
Language: Portuguese from Brazil \ English
Version: 1.0.
Release: September 27 
Coder: Caws.

Well guys, i've created this tool for a friend coz he was going to translate the game, unfornutately he later found out that the game was already in his languages.

So, it may be useful to someonelse.

PS:I haven't tested it coz i dont have a PS3 with Jailbreak, so, if anyone here use it and if it works please tell me!

It worked very well for me. I translated both Uncharted 1&2 with this tool. Can you do something like this for God of War III?

Here is all language files in game. (German, English, French, Italian, Japanese, Korean, NL?, Polski, PT?, Russian, ZH?)

I need to ask... in your tool, you only show 

0000000008	0000248BB5
0000000010	000146986B
0000000018	0002329021
0000000020	0002D1B22F
0000000028	0002D279CC

but you skip each 4 bytes. What do you do with it?
