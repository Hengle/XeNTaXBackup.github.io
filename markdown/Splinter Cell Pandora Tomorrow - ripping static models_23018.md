- Post Title: Splinter Cell Pandora Tomorrow - ripping static models?

Hey folks, complete newbie trying to extract some static models from Splinter Cell Pandora Tomorrow (Unreal 2). I was using UModel, but I've just  looked at the compatibility chart and it's 'no' for static models. Perfect.

I don't suppose anybody has a clue on how to grab the train models from that game?

Hey! Actually there is. Ninja ripper does a pretty good job with both Splinter Cell 1 and Pandora Tomorrow! Static models aren't supported even today (which is BS), so go ahead and use Ninja Ripper. (Works on SVM too)

Hey Pepsee! Going by your avatar, I guess you'd know something about Splinter Cell!

Hmm. Well, that's interesting...

I have the retail CD version of Pandora Tomorrow, plus access to Pandora Tomorrow on Dolphin.

I can't seem to get the PCCD version working (crashes on start), and I can't seem to get Ninja Ripper working with Dolphin.

I don't have access to my desktop (Win 10) just at the moment (I literally just started a full reinstall!), but I don't suppose you could offer some advice on getting PT to work with modern Win 10 systems?

Appreciate the info!

I only used Ninja Ripper on Dolphin when ripping from Double Agent, then using textures from the PS2 ripped file data.
So basically have an emulator for the models and one for the textures (since ripped PS2 models are warped)
Try to find a patch for Pandora, there was one on Moddb.com if I recall..
Good luck!

Hmm, innovative approach there! I'll give it a whack, thank you!
