I see interesting results using the scpack/scexpand compression (a byte pair encoding algorithms) but it's not exact yet.
I guess that the table or the code is a bit different.

for example the attached file has been decompressed from the offset 0x61 to 0x2961 of xml.dat and has some sense.
that's the max I can do for the moment.

Hate to post on old topic but since it's on topic....has anyone been working with the CN .dat, they seem to be a slightly different version than Koreas. I've been trying to figure it out but im not amazing at decrypting this.
