Look, you need to set the ALPHA (A) value of the colour you wish to blend to a low value (0 = 100% background shines through/100% transparency; any higher colour will average the background colour with the colour of the image; and 255 = no shining through, 100% solid image colour). 

So , RGBA = Red Green Blue Alpha. For each 256 colours you can set the individual Alpha value (again: 0 = completely transparent, 255 = completely solid). 

I remember some guys saying you should NOT go to PaintTool and select Yes to overwrite, because that will reset everything. Just start the game. But I'm no expert.

1. so far my tattoo for it to blend in with my skin i need to set my alpha 0 = 100% background shines through/100% right

2. then i need to hit set new values then view alpha right

3. Smackdown vs raw 2011 i do not think that they have transparency for putting logo's go on your arm i mean you can ajust the transparency on your clothing but when it comes to your body i do not think you can
