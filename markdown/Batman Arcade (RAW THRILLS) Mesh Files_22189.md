Just went through your profile and the guy who uploaded the .lux file got that file from me. I already got a quickbms script to unpack it and the models are the only issue now.

funny, how the filename stays the same and the name of the filetype changes....never seen that before ^^
I tried having a look at the 31KB file "missile" with hex2obj, but sadly wasn't able to come up with something :-/
Here's the file in case anyone wants to give it a shot:

You came up fast with this man   
sorry for my late reply...


I'm afraid I messed something up with the UVs ^^

Is the format easy for you to figure out?
If so, could you please have look at this car model?

That would be awesome!
