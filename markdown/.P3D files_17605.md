- Post Title: .P3D files

Hello! This is the first time I am writing in here, and I would like to ask for some help on Popcap's P3D files. I honestly have found no programs that can open it, I am not even sure if they can be opened by any known programs. Can anyone help me with the filetype and maybe open it? I provided an p3d example below. Also if it helps here is how a p3d file looks like when opened by hex editor.



Any other 3d kind of file that I have opened with hex doesn't have a similar format.
Hope I am not breaking any rules and that this file can be finally opened in the future 

Thank you a lot

Can you tell me which extractor did you use on the main.pak file?

I tried the [https://sourceforge.net/projects/popcapunpak](https://sourceforge.net/projects/popcapunpak) but it did not extract the files correctly.

LDinos,

Thank you for sharing the unpacker script. It worked fine.

I added the Bejeweled .p3d loader module to the 3D Object Converter v6.527 and I have released it as a web update.

How to get the 3D Object Converter v6.527:
Please download the 3D Object Converter from [http://3doc.i3dconverter.com](http://3doc.i3dconverter.com) and install it
or download the portable version and extract it into a folder.

Run the program and use the Help/check for updates function to get it.

I will release the updated i3DConverter for Mac and Linux versions later.
[http://www.i3dconverter.com](http://www.i3dconverter.com)


Just copy the .jpg files from the \images\1200\tex folder to the folder where the .p3d files are exist and open the .p3d file.
If you turn on the textured view it will load the right .jpg file automatically and shows it on the 3d model.

It loads all subobjects from the .p3d file.
