Those AQ files are compressed using standard LZSS starting from 0xC.

```
   char magic[8]; // "IZW:SDIC"
   uint32 decompressedSize;
   byte data[x];  // LZSS compressed
}

```

Sorry to bother you so much, but honestly, I don't have anyone more knowledgeable about this matter than you.

Could you help me with the bin file too?

Thanks a lot!

All I know is that this is some kind of binary text format (index + text).
There's not much I can do about it without debugging.

The file contains some form of bytecode which the game appears to process with a custom interpreter.

I had a quick look around and couldn't find any existing implementations so you might need to roll your own. I've dumped all of the [notable strings](https://pastebin.com/PU4QUL8U) in case anyone else has knowledge of this.

```
  int stringDataOffset; // multiply by 4
  byte byteCode[stringDataOffset - 4];
  int stringDataSize;   // multiply by 4, inclusive of this field
  char stringData[stringDataSize - 4];
}

```
