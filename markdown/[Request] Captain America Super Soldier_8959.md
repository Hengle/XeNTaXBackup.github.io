- Post Title: [Request] Captain America: Super Soldier

I remember there being a couple of threads about the game but it looks like nothing became of it. Is anyone out there working on a way to access the game's files or planning to?

I remember looking at some of the files a ways back and I believe they ended with a .data extension.
