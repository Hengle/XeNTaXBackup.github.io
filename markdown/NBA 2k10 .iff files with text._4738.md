- Post Title: NBA 2k10 .iff files with text.

Hi everyone, I wanna make my own language version for this game but I'm not a good programmer so I ask you, can someone make program which can edit text in this game. I search for it everywhere and I couldn't find it.

P.S. Sorry about my english, I'm better in translation than in writing.
