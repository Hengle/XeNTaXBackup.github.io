All files will play correctly if required codes are installed, i strongly recommend the following package/player.
Choose from Basic to Mega depending on your needs: [https://codecguide.com/download_kl.htm](https://codecguide.com/download_kl.htm)

have fun

Yes i have, not all videos come paired with a audio track, sometimes you have to look for the elementary audio stream on your own through its assets, and it happen those your interested in have no sound in the VP6 container but elsewhere, look for it.

For the love of god, avoid the k-lite [trash](http://web.archive.org/web/20090415010710/http://msmvps.com/blogs/chrisl/archive/2004/07/04/9546.aspx). It will just mess with your system codecs. 
MPC+LAVFilters is everything you should ever need at most. 

As for the audio not playing, check: [https://github.com/vgmstream/vgmstream/issues/496](https://github.com/vgmstream/vgmstream/issues/496)

NOT all Frostbite video assets have an audio elementary stream inside the video container (same goes for hundreds of games on various engines), do not speak if you have never extracted assets from mentioned engine, just don't.
Did you at least checked the assets he posted? There's no audio elementary stream in the container, period.
