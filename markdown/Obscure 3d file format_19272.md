- Post Title: Obscure 3d file format

While I have no problem converting the obscure .mdb file to a .obj or anything else, I cannot go back to a .mdb. I have been told that this type of .mdb 3d file is very simple, so maybe someone generous could make a converter from .obj to .mdb? That would be awesome... Attatched is a sample of the .mdb. I can provide a .obj of the same mesh if needed.  Any help in convering to .mdb from obj would be appreciated.

Thanks in advance for your time and consideration.
