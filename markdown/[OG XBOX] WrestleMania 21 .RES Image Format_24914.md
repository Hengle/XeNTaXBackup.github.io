- Post Title: [OG XBOX] WrestleMania 21 .RES Image Format

Hello Xentax forums,

I was trying to figure out the .RES file format used to store unlockable images in the video game WrestleMania 21 for the XBOX. 

This game uses fairly common file formats such as XMV, BIK, DDS etc for most of its assets and the .RES format used for unlockable images I assume either houses or converts to a .TGA or .DDS image file. When you open the .WAD data archives of the game with the "XXI Explorer" mod tool you can see that .RES files that exist in the archive will get converted to .DDS files upon extraction. 

I have included the .RES file that I am trying to crack with this post, the tool used to open the .WAD files, an example WAD file and a header file that you get when you extract an .RES file from the WAD file. All uploads must be unzipped.

Link to example .WAD file [https://www.mediafire.com/file/m3jkxdd7 ... D.wad/file](https://www.mediafire.com/file/m3jkxdd7ernzpao/HD.wad/file)

Thanks for any help!

** Solved. Thanks to Champollion.
To open the .RES files, use TextureFinder v2.1 with DXT3 enabled and 1 or 4 shifts (may vary) in the bottom left hand corner to get the image to display correctly.
