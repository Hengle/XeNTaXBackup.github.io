- Post Title: FF12 Zodiac Age PC modding

Not sure if anyone here cares, but an active modding community for FF12 Zodiac Age on PC ,which was recently released, has already been established.  Could certainly use the help of some talented people here that might allow it to evolve further and quicker.

There are also a few really handy cheat engine tables already.

And a party editor cheat table.

I haven't enjoyed an FF entry since 9 and it's my first time experiencing 12... I personally found it to be among the best in the series.

I have created 2 license board mods for the game.  One that revises the 12 boards but stays true to the 2 job system and another that replaces all 12 boards with a master board similar to the FFX sphere system that includes all licenses but your starting job determines where you begin on the board; with some paths locked until you fulfill a specific condition.

The biggest thing we need right now is an FOV mod, difficulty modifiers and a true 4 party mod that doesn't depend on/get restricted by a 4th guest character. You can kind of do it with the party editor but as soon as you go into the party menu the game forces you to remove the 4th character.

Within the main VBF

/ps2data/image/ff12/test_battle/in/binaryfile

seems like it handles the most interesting functions, but aside from the job boards I have no way of opening the files within.
