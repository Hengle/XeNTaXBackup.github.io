- Post Title: Edit Fonts of Game Two Worlds 2.

Hello everybody, okay? It is the first time I create a topic here and ask them to move if in wrong place, and I apologize for my English (I'm Brazilian).

My team and I are translating this game, but it does not accept any kind of accents of our language (~ ^ '`Ã‡), and the game gets ugly, if the translation is without them.

So I managed to find the sources of the game to do editing and pass it to accept those accents. But could not a method of opening and / or edit them.

here is a file containing all sources.

Thanks to whoever can help me.

Hugs.
