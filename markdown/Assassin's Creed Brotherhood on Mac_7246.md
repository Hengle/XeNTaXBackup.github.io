- Post Title: Assassin's Creed Brotherhood on Mac

Hi, i'm new! 
I have a trouble. Recently, Assassin's Creed Brotherhood English version was release for Mac(I have a Mac), and for PC(Russian version) it was release has long ago.
I has copied the sound files from a PC and transferred them on a MAC, but subtitles(menu text, mission text) were in English. However I found Russian subtitles inside Brotherhood forge file(dataMAC.forge), although the release was reported about several languages​​, but certainly not about the Russian.
Now in game menu, Spoken language category there Russian, but in Subtitle language - English(see attached pics).
Which file can be responsible for identifying language? Maybe language.lang? But i tried delete it, and game was run without problem.
Or whether there has any possibility of editing Forge files, in order to replace the contents from LocalizationPackageRussian to LocalizationPackageEnglish?
Or maybe there's another way?
P.S. I opened the FORGE file contents using forgelib_release from DerPlaya discussed in this topic [viewtopic.php?f=10&t=3005&p=58125](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=3005&p=58125)
Sorry for my English.
