- Post Title: Sword and Fairy Nine Regions Rip

Hello,
i am currently trying to rip models and textures out of mobile game called Sword and Fairy Nine Region. The assets of the game are encrypted in dat files and are not viewable in Asset Studio, Neosis, or RMA viewer. According to a decrypter in CN, the game is encrypted by moving its resource address. Could anyone provide some help and guidance as to how to obtain the models? The following url contains a sample file of the encrypted dat file. Viewing through hex editor shows Unity FS. Thank in advance!

I tried this long back: [https://www.taptap.io/app/145198?hreflang=en_US](https://www.taptap.io/app/145198?hreflang=en_US); I'm not sure if it's working, If not, let me know, and I will try to follow some online tutorials available at [Sword Encyclopedia](https://swordencyclopedia.com/), but they all seem to be aimed at extracting unencrypted files. Last time, while following some tutorials, many seem to require a sword older version of the game or use a rooted phone which mine is not.
