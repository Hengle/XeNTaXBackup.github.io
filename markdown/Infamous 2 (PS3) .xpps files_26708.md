- Post Title: Infamous 2 (PS3) .xpps files

Hello everybody!

I have been looking for a way to get the models from Infamous 2. XPPS files are still being used for recent games by Sucker Punch Productions but of course, the engine got updated since the release of this PS3 game so none of the most recent tools works.
The only thing i know is that the files should include models and textures inside, unfortunately, i don't have much info to share

Here's a few samples extracted from the game files [https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/ ... share_link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1xT6mjxrgljaNSWNBFxdJ4btrYyNZ76UO?usp=share_link)

Any help will be appreciated!

I have no idea (the only vertices that looked kinda like a model):

What a shame. The only thing I could find was a texture using the raw texture previewer but as I didn't know the correct offset it was a complete mess.

I tried softwares like Ninja Ripper (which i honestly, i know is far from being a good option) with RPCS3 but the version that supposedly works with OpenGL just crashes the emulator. RenderDoc didn't work either.
