- Post Title: Need for Speed Carbon: Own the City (PSP/Zeebo) - help with graphics

I'm trying to make mods from Zeebo's NFS Carbon Own The City (but it uses the exact same files as the PSP version, it's basically a direct port)

I had no problems with the .big files, I used QuickBMS with the ea_big4.bms line of code and the Zeebo version files extracted without any problems.

My problem now is with the graphics files ( .viv / .apt / .const / .dds / .msh / .o ) of these files only the .dds and .msh I was able to identify, but even them I could not open or change correctly:



With the .viv files I had even less luck, I couldn't open the file containing the car models for some reason using viveditor, the other files opened:


I really want to be able to create mods for this version, but I found extremely few tools for the PSP versions of Need for Speed (only for PCs and Consoles versions) can anyone help me?

Here the link of the extracted Zeebo version if it helps in any way :

Your link is broken. Can you upload to another hosting site like mega.nz?
