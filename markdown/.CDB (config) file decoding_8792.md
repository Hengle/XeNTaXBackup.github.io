- Post Title: .CDB (config) file decoding

Hey, i need a tool to decode encrypted .cdb files and reencode them back.

Encrypted .cdb files:
*snip*/ItemResource.cdb
*snip*/Itemsetinfo.cdb
*snip*/Level.cdb
*snip*/Emoticon.cdb
*snip*/ItemEdition.cdb

These files need some kind of key to decode them. Help me find one please.
