- Post Title: [IKS] Regular Char Replacer

Hello. I want to share my script which I used to replace characters in game Papo & Yo. But my script is universal and can be used on any other game too.

How to use it:
1. Install Python 2.7
2. Edit values in script as you wish (for example change .replace('Ś', 'S') to .replace('Ü', 'S'))
3. Comment function that you don't want to use.
4. Uncomment function you want to use.
5. Specify correct file extensions and paths.
6. Run script.

Functionality:
You can replace every character in multiple files with multiple extensions executing just one script.

Advantages:
- Recursive file search
- Free
- Open source
- Universal

Enjoy.

1. In the Input window, type or paste the block of text that includes the material that you want to replace.
2. In the “Find text” field, enter the text that you want to replace, noting that this is not case sensitive. If you enter “red” you replace “red” only and “Red” if it appears.
3. In the “Replace with” field, place the text you want to use for replacing.
4. In the Output window, see the block of text with the text replaced.
