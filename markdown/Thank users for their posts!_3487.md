[EDIT]: New Thank poster button down right, under the post. [viewtopic.php?f=28&t=3487&p=63361#p63361](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=28&t=3487&p=63361#p63361)

Do not forget to thank those that help you out! 

[OLD TEXT]

Maintenance resulted in some funny behaviour of the site when trying to install a Thank You mod. Despite perfect simulations, the real thing seemed to act like a moron. 

It should work now. When you see a post that really made you happy, when people offer good assistance, why not press the THANK POST button in the post? It's located at the left-bottom of the post. Give them the kudos already!

You'll find that the number of times you have thanked others, as well as the number of times you were thanked appear in your user profile section next to each post.

Well, it took 20 Years! But this is definitely a wise and prudent addition to the site. A much-needed expression of [optional] gratitude   

Love the Xen

Yep but it would be nice if it wouldn't look that ugly.
Furthermore it's kinda confusing that it isn't located "within the post's boundaries", there's no visible relatedness.

I guess shifting it 1 position upwards above that dark bar would be a good start

I'd put it either to the left of the quote button or the flag button, that way it shows that its relating the to the post they're looking at and not the user who posted it (Right now its by the user's stuff, profile & pm)

I don't mean to necro-post (granted this is only a week or two old. But it appears that this feature has been removed. Is this due to the virus that attacked Xentax?

Yes. It forced an update of phpbb, and the mod functions no longer correctly, I will get it back in the coming week, hopefully.

Ah okay I understand. Thank you for your reply. I was just curious whether it was just some freak thing that I wasn't seeing it anymore. I'll wait patiently just like everyone else. Thanks.

I joined earlier this year, and have thanked people/posts by posting a thanks, would it be wrong to retrospectively thank those people/posts now that this option is available again?
thanks

I really like that "thank you" feature, thank you very much for activating it, Mr.Mouse!   

Just a small improvement I want to suggest: On the profile pages, it says "times:" and "{ THANKED }:". It would be great if you could rename it into something more meaningful, like "This user thanked:" and "This user received thanks:".

By the way, I can't post "thank yous" on any of the announcement threads, (the icons just do not show up below the posts) but this is not that important.

I also fixed an issue with Attachments. Can be done now again (up to 256 kb).

Maybe I'm an old dumb turd but I have no idea what a silly "thanks" button causes. I never click on such button but the browser loads the website nevertheless - strange.

I fixed the template for that user view page. It was redundant code from the old thanksforpost mod. You can select the whole list at the bottom of the profile page, much better. 

It is correct, announcements are not possible, I think I will need to edit it myself to do that. It's not a big deal though.
