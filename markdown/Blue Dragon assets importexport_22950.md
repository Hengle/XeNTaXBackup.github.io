- Post Title: Blue Dragon assets import/export

Recently, I tried to extract assets from the JRPG game Blue Dragon using a bms script, but I couldn't find any way to import/export them as they are in an uncommon format. Does anybody know how to import/export them?

Here's the link to the files.

Hello. As you said in your post, this file format is handled by QuickBMS script [https://aluigi.altervista.org/bms/bluedragon.bms](https://aluigi.altervista.org/bms/bluedragon.bms)
but it seems it throws some memory allocation error while unpacking files.

Maybe file format has changed recently. I haven't checked it, but maybe
you should ask aluigi to update this script.
