- Post Title: Fallout: New Vegas, Skyrim, etc. BSA

I've published a BSA module for Unpakke. Of course it can both unpack and pack the BSA's so have fun modding these games.
Just keep in mind that the files are BIG and it might take some time to repack them.

Also, don't forget to read the included TXT file.

P.S.
I'll be happy to know if someone can test the module with Fallout 3, The Elder Scrolls (previous Skyrim editions) and share the results, to update the supported games list on nullsecurity.org.
