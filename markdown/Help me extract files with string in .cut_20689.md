Try this BMS script, it should do the job:


# .cut file extractor
# By Dave, 2019

set OFFSET 0
set COUNT 1
get FSIZE asize

DO 
	GOTO OFFSET
	GET MISC1 long
	GET SIZE long
	REVERSELONG SIZE
	SET FILENAME COUNT
	STRING FILENAME + ".WMSF"

	LOG  FILENAME OFFSET SIZE

	MATH OFFSET + SIZE
	MATH COUNT + 1

WHILE OFFSET < FSIZE
