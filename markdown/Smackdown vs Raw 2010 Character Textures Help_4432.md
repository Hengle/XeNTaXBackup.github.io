- Post Title: Smackdown vs Raw 2010 Character Textures Help?

Hello,

I have searched the boards for the way to do this but, I haven't had any luck  

I am looking for a way to apply face and body textures to the character models I have loaded into 3ds max 2009.
I use QuickBMS 0.3.14c along with the yukes script to extract the .pac files, then load the model into max using the yukes.ms.
I have a load of .dds textures in the folder with the models, but none that look like the face or body textures.

I have seen pics on this board of the models in max with applied textures, so I'm wondering what I'm doing wrong?



Thanks to Aluigi and chroxx for the current tools and sorry for the noob question.

EDIT: Okay I think I see what is wrong now The Alpha mask is apparently hiding the textures. The GIMP wouldn't allow me to see this, but after loading the images in WTV viewer from nvidia and not displaying the alpha channel It is there, and now how to apply these textures?
