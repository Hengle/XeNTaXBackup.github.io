GT6 (Gran Turismo 6) [PS3] tool

Usage: drop "body", "wheel", "interior" or other model file onto the tool.

If body has "body_s", it must be in the same directory.
If you got any messages like "unsupported code" during extraction, it means facebuffer has some unsupported parts, and the whole submesh will only have vertices, no faces.

Currently supports most (about 99%) car meshes and textures. Some UVs scaled 2x, I have no fix for this yet.

I cant understand please elaborate

if you're extracting, for example, a "wheel", its only one file.

but if you're extracting car body, usually you need 2 files to be in the same directory with the tool: body & body_s

Tried to convert the entire Toronado exterior to quads, and got a little question
Are some meshes supposed to be triangulated despite being clearly modeled like subdiv surfaces?
It's a shame the cars don't have door sills

As he already specified, to keep method safe, meaning that way devs wont be changing the way they encrypted game assets to NOT make things more difficult for the future, get it?

First you need to gain access to the VOL file from a Disc Game version.
body_s is just a second file for main body where you drag and drop it on the tool for extraction/conversion.

This updated tool will allow to extract GT6 packages that have no VOL file, but 1000's of small files in PDIPFS directory.
As a result, it can extract DLCs, updates or original game packaged in PDIPFS format. It will not extract VOL files anymore.

All original Flatz code, slightly modified by me.

Usage: same command line, just instead of VOL file, you give it your PDIPFS folder name, where your DLC files are extracted.

Note: there are 2 types of files in PDIPFS: "full" files and "partial" files. This version only supports full files.

Well, its quite simple actually, DLCs are in separate files, NOT in the main VOL archive, so for what ever car your looking for that is part of a DLC just extract that DLC, and that's it.
