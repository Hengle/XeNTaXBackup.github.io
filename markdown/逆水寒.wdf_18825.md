I'm a newcomer. I hope you can help me extract the audio from the WDF file. I can only extract the FDW file by using. against_cold_wdf. I can't extract any information from the FSB file。

I'd love to upload files, too. Files have 1g capacity, but now there's another headache for me. There's audio unpacking for Moonlight Blade.

Forgive me for using Google translation to communicate with you. What I want to solve most is this document. 
The audio content I extracted from this attached file is empty. I can suspect that it might be damaged or unpacked. I would like to be helped to extract playable files using some scripting tool. Thank you again.

That's the file. I'm not sure if the unpacker I'm using has a problem or is it the file itself?

I use this to unpack FSB.
The problem is that the wav is played out without any sound, including waveform.

That sample you uploaded seems to be an invalid/corrupted one, not sure what's wrong?
Have you tried this: [http://aezay.dk/aezay/fsbextractor/](http://aezay.dk/aezay/fsbextractor/) on a original file?
Or maybe this: [http://forum.worldoftanks.eu/index.php? ... ractor-v1/](http://forum.worldoftanks.eu/index.php?/topic/364201-tool-fmod-fsb-extractor-v1/)
Who knows maybe this: [viewtopic.php?f=32&t=16046&hilit=fmod+tools](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=32&t=16046&hilit=fmod+tools)
And foobar2000 with vgmstream plugin should work on a legit file that is not corrupt or damaged after unpacking.

The file should be damaged. The script maker said that file extraction is OK. Can you see if the file is damaged?
