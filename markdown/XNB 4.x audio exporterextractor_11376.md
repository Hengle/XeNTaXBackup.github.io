- Post Title: XNB 4.x audio exporter/extractor

It seems like none of the tools that worked for 3.0+ XNA formats (Terraria/Fez/etc) are compatible with new one (4.0+). Any idea how to extract mp3/ogg from new XNBs?

Unfortunately the only tool I've found to work consistently is GXview from [http://gruaz.net/?page_id=407](http://gruaz.net/?page_id=407) It's donationware and you need to give at least 1 euro then wait for an email back.

It does not work, I tried it. In only allows you to view content of XNB that has graphical data (ie textures, etc, which it exports into PNG). XNB with audio it treats the same.
