the only way I remember to import yobj model files is this script for PS2:
[viewtopic.php?f=16&t=10762&p=90851&hilit=yobj#p90851](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=10762&p=90851&hilit=yobj#p90851)

Use forum search on yobj for other ways.
In Search these results box enter wii

just perform the steps in the tutorial and apply the mad baby texture to the cube.
Then you should know how to do this for any other model.

The texture to be applied has to be in a format that 3dsmax can handle (*.dds, *. png, *.tga?, *.jpg?)

Just select the geometry you want the material applied to. Don't select everything.

> And Brother PLs tell me how can reset all 3ds max 09 settingI don't know. Never needed to do that.

To get back Blinn Basic Parameters (Ambient/Diffuse/Specular etc.) just select the next unused material sphere.

Don't give up.
