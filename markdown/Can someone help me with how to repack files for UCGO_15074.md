- Post Title: Can someone help me with how to repack files for UCGO?

I got tools for compression and decompression already.
Here's the links where you can find them.
Tool1:[http://ucgoserver.com/gameclient/Titans-ZLIB.zip](http://ucgoserver.com/gameclient/Titans-ZLIB.zip)
Tool2:[http://ucgoserver.com/gameclient/UCGOZLIB.zip](http://ucgoserver.com/gameclient/UCGOZLIB.zip)
Both tools can be used to do compress/decompress
And a bit of tap the game admin gives about how to use the second one:[http://ucgoserver.com/open-source-stuff/ucgozlib-jar/](http://ucgoserver.com/open-source-stuff/ucgozlib-jar/)
The example game files is uploaded to mega.

U will need both files to able to unpack them.
I'm here because I'm totally a noob for programming and know nothing about Java and netbeans. 


It would be very nice if someone can help me out with the problems. I got my java set properly already. Maybe it's just the misunderstanding of the command lines.

File is zlib compressed, try offzip.

Also, moving this since the compression is known.
