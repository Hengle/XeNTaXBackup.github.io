- Post Title: Split/Second archive

Hi all. Forgive me in advance for my bad English. I think you will understand my problem. Is the game Split/Second. I would like there to port their models not only cars, but also objects on the map. The problem is that I don't know what format all models of the game. All files in Packed format .ark. We have opened these files using GUI_for_QuickBMS. The most we can do is replace the textures of some cars and digging in the files responsible for the characteristics of something. Is .XML .CXF .DAT .FEV, .FSB, .GFX .IRD .RDH, .WAAW and many others. Using ninja ripper I got the car, but the maps of the race tracks to get uncomfortable. Please help to find the models files.
