try SUPER

edit
i recommend downloading an older version of it from here for a clean installer
[http://www.oldversion.com/windows/super/](http://www.oldversion.com/windows/super/)
because they added malware and PUP to the free installer you get on the official site   

PUP = potentially unwanted programs

I do NOT recommend for you to convert YouTube videos, since they're very lossy quality and converting them makes it worse.
the simple solution would be for you to re-mux it in to a MKV container with the one and only MKVToolNix, which speeds up everything since it puts both video and audio in a new MKV container that can take between few seconds up to few minutes depending on the file size/duration.
here is the link for what ever OS version you need.

hope it helps, cheers.

Yesterday, I accidentally watched an article introducing the MKV format. This article contain a part which shows how to [make MKV files via MKVToolNix](http://www.videos-converter.net/resources/what-is-mkv.html). You can check the tutorial to learn how to make MKV files. Also, it recommend a method to convert other format to MKV with easy steps.
