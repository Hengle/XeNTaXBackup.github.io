NECRO BUMP my old thread about Too Human, uploaded files still seem to be fine in my previous post
once gildor's site comes back up I'm going to try and contact him about this as well.
for those that dont know, Too Human is built on UnrealEngine3, however the company modified the engine and called it their own (and got sued by epic due to it).
For the most part the engine seems to be basically the same in the sence that all UE3 builds are, so the models, textures, etc should still follow the standard coding formats.
