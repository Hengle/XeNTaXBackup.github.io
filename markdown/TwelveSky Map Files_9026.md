- Post Title: TwelveSky Map Files

Hey guys.
For the past few years i have been very intrigued with the 12sky map file formats. I think they hold world mesh and textures. Here is the link to the samples i uploaded. I really hope someone can help. I have been trying to workout the compression algorithm used and possibly decompress one of them to take a look for a few years now with no luck.

The script for 12sky and 12sky 2 for Noesis never released, i think the format files of this game its very hard.
