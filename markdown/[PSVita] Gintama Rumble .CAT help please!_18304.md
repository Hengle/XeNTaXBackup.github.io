- Post Title: [PSVita] Gintama Rumble .CAT help please!

I was wondering if anybody could help with these .cat files from Gintama Rumble. I've tried to look around, but I cannot seem to find anything that works on them. Thanks!

(That bms script doesn't work though, so you need to ask Aluigi whether he will update it.)

Have you tried mikulover39's .cat bmscript? It worked nicely on my end, even from PS4 version of Gintama Rumble. It can be found here [https://www.vg-resource.com/thread-29836.html](https://www.vg-resource.com/thread-29836.html)

Speaking of which, I managed to grab the texture files from it's .GXT archives with noesis, so far importing .tmd didn't work that I asked RandomTBush to update the maxscript, and it's gonna be a while before it's release.

Yeah, I've tried it but it just sits there an does nothing. Won't even pop up an error. Just nothing.
