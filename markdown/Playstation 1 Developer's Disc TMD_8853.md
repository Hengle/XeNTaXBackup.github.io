- Post Title: Playstation 1 Developer's Disc TMD

I want to import these TMD models into milkshape, but milkshape 3D's saying the header is incorrect. The models come from the Playstation Developer Disc released with some of the first PSX's. I attached one of the many TMDs in the disc.

EDIT: Oops! Wrong forum! Can an admin move this?
