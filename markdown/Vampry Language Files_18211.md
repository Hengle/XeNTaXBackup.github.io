The Blood Quality of the Citizens is largely influenced by their health and the number of hints you gathered before Embracing him or her.
As of late, the rumours that surround Whitechapel are ripening into facts. The police had suspected the district for the past three months, of hosting what might have been the midpoint of London's medicine black market. It is now proven. <lf><lf>Police forces conducted yesterday around noon one of their most widespread roundups, raiding the neighbourhood, arresting four-dozen suspects, and seizing more than a ton of drugs. The medicine is known to have been acquired through illegal means and the authorities are currently trying to contain and suspend what appears to be a capital-wide traffic.<lf><lf>Several inhabitants of Whitechapel have condemned the intervention: the arrested citizens were owners of the drugs, not resellers, and even if they did refuse to disclose their supplier (legal or not), they all had a proven need for these pills and tablets and capsules. The brutality of the intrusion was also denounced by resident and nurse Dorothy Crane, who knew of the frailty of the men and women taken into custody.<lf><lf>A rally is organized this evening at 5 pm on Burslem Street to discuss and possibly protest the arrest. Your servant will be there to collect testimonies: come in numbers.<lf><lf>E.W.

Even if based on proven medical knowledge from 1918, Vampyr sometimes takes liberties when establishing possible links between scientific theories and supernatural creatures, for theatrical purposes. In other words, do not try to cure any disease with any of the recipes shown in this videogameâ€¦ And no rats were harmed during the making of this game.
