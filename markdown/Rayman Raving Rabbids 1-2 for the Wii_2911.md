mmmm, my previous post was not sent ...

hi,

i'm working with hcs on the in_cube winamp plugin ([http://hcs64.com/in_cube.html](http://hcs64.com/in_cube.html))

Actually, we work for supporting most of the formats found on wii.

wam is allready supported but those ones found in rayman are slighty differents, so unplayable.

it's simply a file container with gc adpcm in it.

check the homepage of in_cube to know when this will be supported.

thx for info & samples.

cya

If there were updates they wouldn't be hiding them from you.
