- Post Title: [FantasyTennis] .res & .set files

Hello dear community,

I need help in the game Fantasy Tennis. Fantasy Tennis files are .res files and they are AES cryptet. I have an AES crypter, so i can encrypt and decrypt them. 

But in the .res files are existing .set files. One of the best FantasyTennis hacker has released a .set decrypter but not an encrypter(and is not giving it away). The set decrypter is doing this: .set -> .txt
My question is how i can get the encryption code for that, so that i can make an encrypter. : .txt -> .set

Here is a rar with a .set file and the decryptet .txt file. I hope that you can help me, and say me the encryption of the .set files^^

Best Regards harCs

upload the set decrypter

the set files have 1 byte more than the txt files, but my xor detection skills are limited

Ok, here the decrypter. 
How to use: Take the .set file and put it in the SettingDecoder.exe, then you get the .txt file in the same directory as the .set file
