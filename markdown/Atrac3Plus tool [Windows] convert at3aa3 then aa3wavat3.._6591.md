- Post Title: Atrac3Plus tool [Windows] convert at3>aa3 then aa3>wav>at3..

This tool i found on a JAP site,It converts psp(or ps3) at3 and at3Plus files to Sony Sound forge. aa3 files.so you can downsample with Sony Sound forge (i use pro10)then use this tool to convert back to at3!!also it converts PMF at3`s(which have no header)to aa3 then you can convert it to a wave file!!



As you can see just drag and drop your files,if your at3 files have a loop it will extract them to a loop folder and if not then it extracts the file to a non loop folder.
When you come to convert your files back to at3 remember to select loop ot not!!

Hve fun!!

As per PM,OrangeC this tool will handle the headerless at3 files as well,like the ones from a PMF file,so you can convert to wave file..Thats if you are downsampling PMF files.
