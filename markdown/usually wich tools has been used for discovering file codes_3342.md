Can you tell us usually wich tools has been used for discovering file codes ?
i think one of them is Notepad++ [http://notepad-plus.sourceforge.net/uk/site.htm](http://notepad-plus.sourceforge.net/uk/site.htm)

You mean figuring out file formats?
lol Notepad++ is a text editor, you need a hex editor like "010 Editor" to do that.

I use Hex Workshop most of the time, 010 Editor is also an excellent choice.

to find out the ID of the file you only care about the first 3-4 letters of the file so window's notepad pretty much does it anyway, if it's a simple format then you can pretty much view everything with notepad, too, at least if they are in ascii text

I use HIEW from a russian developer. With its ASCII-like window-view it simplifies the view of a file structure.
010EDITOR is too sophisticated for me because if I had to write a script for this editor I would have written a complete procedure for my program.

Writing a script is much faster than writing a program.

if you refer to having an initial idea of what known algorithms could have been used in a program, personally I wrote and use a tool for this job: [http://aluigi.org/mytoolz.htm#signsrch](http://aluigi.org/mytoolz.htm#signsrch)

the disassembling/debugging job becomes more simple when you already know what algorithms are used and in what locations

I believe that if we can reveal source code (or part of it) applied in some .exe files it is very drastic for decoding complex problems ! whether is it possible to recycle source codes from .exe that writen in languages like C++ c# vb .... even dos programmes ?
I very searched for such tools but i can't find anything if you know such tools plesae tell us thank ?

Well, there are some recompilers around, you should check the internet. You can use tools such as IDA Pro and WINDASM to check out the assembly code.

the decompilers can help a lot although don't expect to see the original code ready to use.
in general for the executables there are commercial solutions like hex ray or the free, and very good since I have used and still use it, REC: [http://www.backerstreet.com/rec/rec.htm](http://www.backerstreet.com/rec/rec.htm)
there is also Boomerang ([http://boomerang.sourceforge.net](http://boomerang.sourceforge.net)) but I have never had good results with it.

exist also decompilers written for a specific language (like the class files of java or the python compiled code) or for executables built with a specific programming language (like C# and .net)

1 : can you add more details to this chart !
2 : is it possible that when game loaded to RAM take a snapshoot from RAM and save it to hard for later analyzing or monitoring of it ?

You can run your game in VMWare and take a snapshot, you can then return to that snapshot whenever you want.

thanks a lot for your guide MR Just   
i think working with VMWare must be difficult for me !
can you suggest more simple tools that can take snapshot from RAM ?
i am going to buy one of these software if someone have experience with one of them please report it thank ?
VMWare
VirtualBox
VSPE
StarPort
QEMU Manager
Virtual PC 2007
Virtual Hard Drive
and tell me wich of them have the capability to do my purpose ( RAM snapshot )

@shekofte:
According to your untidy chart it seems to me that you don't understand the general structure of a todays computer which hasn't been changed much in general for more than 60 years. ("von Neumann"-structure is described [here](http://www.ba-horb.de/~pl/BS_Skript/node12.html) (German)).

It makes no sense taking a RAM-snapshot to analyze algorithms or data structures, because if data is loaded into the RAM, it is likely that the software modifies and stores it in a way where it can it process easier.

If you want to learn some hacking, you could get some old games for Windows-95 (which have no sophisticated CD-protections in most cases), a decent disassembler and a hex editor, and try to remove CD-requests.
My first Windows-target was Tomb Raider 2. It was easier than I thought...

@shekofte:
virtualbox is free, very complete and continuosly updated: [http://www.virtualbox.org](http://www.virtualbox.org)

@asmxtx/shekofte:
that graph has a sense only for executables which use special encryptions and anti-debugging techniques

@asmxtx , your judgement is false and fast !
my theory is that some games (recently VALVE games : left for dead) apply complex distributed structure for files on the hard , so that decoding of them is difficult in this case , but when game is loaded (or a round of game ) it is needful to collect them in one place on the RAM !
is it true ?

Unfortunatly I can't decrypt what you write in your post and what your goal is (I don't want to appear aggorant).
Your picture shows a glass-wearer. Yes, I am wearing glasses, too.

I don't want you to disabuse! You should be more tanglible.
In my opinion you should sort your technical problem first, think about it A LONG time, and - only if you aren't be able to find a solution - ask a question to other people. That doesn't apply not only to the concern itself, but to the linguistic problem expressions you do.

HOW ARE YOU asmxtx ? I thought about your instruction , yes you are right , I am a little agitated .
because i am a beginner . I planned to equip myself with powerfull softwares and then choose my target !
now i have a gallery of hex editors many of them are able to take RAM snapshot like " hex editor neo "
thanks.......................end.

You can dump ram. It's possible on pc and xbox. I've written a MemoryStream class in C# to do just that. It's just like a binary reader/writer except you use it with memory. For xbox, it requires some hardcore modifications and some moderate knowledge.

HELLO grimdoomer , thanks for your announce .
I visited your website .
but i can't find the RAM dumper that you mentioned , there !
i excited to try it ! please attach it or put a direct link to it !
thanks a lot , sincerely

please a gentleman tell me how can dump memory of VIDEO CARD ?
although some tools like 3d ripper dx ,ogle , print screen exist , but each of them has their own disadvantages ! thanks a lot .......

HxD hex editor can dump the memory from normal ram and it can attack to an exe so you only see the ram you want to dump.
[http://mh-nexus.de/en/hxd/](http://mh-nexus.de/en/hxd/)
Programs like 3dripperdx and ogle or 3dvia print screen hook the functions of open gl or direct x in order to rip the models wich is very complicated and requires a very good understanding of the functions and how they work and the knowledge to code such a program also.
