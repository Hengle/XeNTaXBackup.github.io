- Post Title: parsing map files

Has anyone taken time to parse map files for any MMO's? A lot of them I've seen define a list of objects that should be drawn, followed by a bunch of integers that seem to be indexing into that list.

There's usually a lot of other different files in the folder though, like heightmaps and stuff.
