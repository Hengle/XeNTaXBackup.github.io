- Post Title: Raging Blast 2 Modding Help

Hello there I am fairly new to modding games and such but anyway I am trying to extract the files from this game using noesis but every time I do I always get an error saying that the file is too massive (1.21 Gb) and cannot be handled as a stream. Is there any way to fix this? I've seen some people on youtube that have been able to extract them and I just wanna figure out how.
