- Post Title: Extracting battle dialogue from Lost Odyssey (XBOX 360)?

I just bought a copy of Lost Odyssey for XBOX 360 from a guy on eBay. I bought this game because to my surprise I enjoyed the cutscenes movie on YouTube. This is the only JRPG I didn't hate on sight so now that the movie is over (it took me 3 days to watch the movie and I saved the deleted scenes for Day 4) I want to hear what everyone says during battle. I want to hear the win quotes, lose quotes, attack quotes, K.O.'d quotes and whatever else they say during battle. Which software should I use to find and extract these files? Sorry for the noob question by the way.

Anyway, I found this post long before I ever heard of Lost Odyssey. I just found it again and to my surprise this guy was trying to extract the battle dialogue too. I don't know what custom plug ins the one guy uses so help out if you can. Thanks. Guy's post: [http://hcs64.com/mboard/forum.php?showthread=19252](http://hcs64.com/mboard/forum.php?showthread=19252)

Thanks for answering! Unfortunately I don't have any files to upload. When I view the folders on game disc 1 of 4 in IsoBuster or similar, the Audio folder is strangely empty. Before I found this site I started working on this on my own by trying to find out how to turn an XBOX 360 disc into an iso. I followed the instructions of some really really old posts from a few different sites and no matter which software and method I followed I ended up with a tiny file like 5.?? MB from disc 1. I just tried using IsoBuster to turn disc 1 into an .iso and the completed file is only 5.32 MB. So I guess I should back up and ask which free software to use to turn XBOX 360 discs into normal .iso with like 6 GB or whatever? I don't need step by step instructions or anything. Just the names of the free software I should be using and if I run into trouble I'll just look for YouTube tutorials. 

Edited to correct DT to IB. And I just used Daemon Tools on disc 3 and DT also said the file would be 5.32 MB. The game is so big that they had to put it on 4 discs! And there are more than 6 hours of cutscenes. I don't know where these programs are getting this file size from.

IIRC, you need a certain type of DVD drive that can read them. There's a list of them online that can read 360 discs properly.

After ending up with a .xex file from a suspiciously small download I got stuck again. Searching for what I'm trying to do isn't working and I'm sure that adding the game title wouldn't be helpful at all. I've been downloading programs from Softpedia and less reputable sources for the past few days and nothing did what it was supposed to and now I'm going to stop trying before I get an apocalyptic computer virus. I can't believe I bought a game for a console I don't own and now I can't do the one thing I bought the game for. This sucks! But anyway, thanks a lot for your help.
