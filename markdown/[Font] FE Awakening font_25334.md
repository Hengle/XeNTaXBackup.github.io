- Post Title: [Font] FE Awakening font

Hello everyone.

I'm truly desperate now    

I'm working on localizing the FE Awakening to Vietnamese. Everything is fine but the font. 

The game uses bfnt font packed with png in a .lz file. I used FEAT tool to extract the .lz file adn got the fonts but don't know how to add more unicode characters. 

Thanks in advance!!

attached .lz files and extracted files via FEAT: [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1yT8iMF ... sp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1yT8iMFbDWxAmQXuv9QsgqNViKB45a4yl/view?usp=sharing)
