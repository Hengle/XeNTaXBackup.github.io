Has anyone ripped Crysis 2 sound effects and voices yet from the beta? I would be interested in listening to them for fun.

FSBext works great to extract the sounds but they do not seem to be properly converted, to convert them to something that can be heard what can be used?

Also TsunamiZ what is the path for the voices files?

Thanks in advance.

In that case instead of using FSBext, try [towav.exe](http://www.box.net/shared/zd9blkhsuo).

they are properly converted, you just need the proper codecs, it's either ima adpcm wavs or xbox adpcm wavs, cant remember.
