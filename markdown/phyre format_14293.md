helped my self with your tutorial to understand the core of the file with all your post i found a solution to extract dds from phyre .
open in hexa 
extract only the code of the picture
open in texture finder
save the picture
open in photoshop and modify it
save to dds format shown on the header with dds plugin
upress the ne header and reinject the hexa it worked for me :p

ps: yeah this one when you talk about extract dds
