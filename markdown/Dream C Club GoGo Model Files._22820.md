- Post Title: Dream C Club GoGo Model Files.

I posted in the discord for help but nobody got around to helping me. 
So i need to figure out what file has the models in it and how to extract them. 

I think they might be in the cmb files because the .cat files are just entirely to small but then again there aren't any textures for them at all what so ever anywhere. 
below is the format of one of the character folders. 

and here is the entier chr folder that we think houses the model files.

Yeah the models are apparently in the .cat files but theres no way to open them. the quick BMS script for the tamsoft games dosnt work at all.

Uvs are not that good, I don't know if they are ShortSig.

The texture comes right after the mesh, I believe they are DXT1.
Some other files contain mesh and texture together.
Were these files extracted from a single file?

I got the folder directly off of the disc i own for the game so idk. 
It seems like you were able to get into them though. how did you do it?
