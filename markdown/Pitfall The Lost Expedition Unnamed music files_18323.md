Literal unnamed file extension, Was wondering if anybody can understand it at all considering I really do enjoy this game's soundtrack.

Unzip this file in the music folder: [https://www.sendspace.com/file/q9fzlx](https://www.sendspace.com/file/q9fzlx)

Then the files should play with the latest vgmstream: [https://hcs64.com/vgmstream.html](https://hcs64.com/vgmstream.html)
