A simple extractor for Marvel Heroes textures. While it was impossible before to support these in Umodel, we can still extract textures.



This simple tool will extract all textures. Textures will have names since 2016 version. Vast majority of them will be extracted properly, and only a few (non-squared) will have incorrect headers. You can correct these manually.

Usage: just drag TextureFileCacheManifest.bin onto Marvel_heroes_tfc.exe
TFC files must be in the same folder.

Update:  Level textures supported now.

Downloaded Steam version of Marvel Heroes 2016 to test this out. I'm getting a "Marvel_heroes_tfc.exe has stopped working" error when I try this. Tried it on both Windows 7 and 10.

Oh. They have names in 2016 version. The developers finally understood that these hashes are not convenient for them themselves. Good. Expect a new version soon.

It works for me with steam version, but I think it must work with non-steam version too. Are you running it on a 32-bit version of windows?

this is 32-bit version of that dll.

Are you sure you're running it right? Put all files mentioned in the same folder, and drop manifest file onto the EXE.

Currently doing one more try with the new dll will be posting results in 10 minutes, hopefully successful.

EDIT
Did one more try with the new dll. Sorry got the same negative results for Win 10(64bit) as above. Interestingly Windows 7 (32bit) got me this...


Is there something I missed doing or doing wrong with the process?

Fantastic job daemon1!! Given this is essentially the same problem faced with DCUO, is there any chance you might be able to make an extractor similar that would work with that? I know they recently updated a lot of the characters in that and it'd be great to be able to get into those textures too...

I think with the earlier versions of the game when it was still with Sony, textures were supported by umodel. The latest versions, with the new publishers, the codes were changed when new characters were added thus breaking umodel texture support.

Just tell him that after some update they have names in manifest. This will be very easy for him to implement. I think. I will contact him later.

Working awesome, but would it be possible eventually to update it to access more textures? Such as the items dropped on the ground? Like: UC__MarvelItem_Armor_AntMan_Belt01_SF.upk and/or ability textures. In your own time mate, because I am ever so thankful for what you have provided already.

Of course, this is not a surprise - UModel doesn't support customized texture system from this game. There are hundreds of games, and I work alone on the project ...

Hi!
Yesterday I had troubles trying to login to Xentax. I'd like to use your code, if it is okay to you, to extend UModel's texture loading capabilities for this game.

I don't think the Marvel Heroes tool had been updated with DCUO texture extraction, daemon1 was just showing he was able to extract the textures.

It's always better to ask in the thread for infinite crisis.

I don't have reports that it needs to be updated. If the file is 0kb that means the tool suspected there was a model, but it was not. What package was that?

About animations, as I said I never worked with havok. You can't get bones probably because the tool you're using is for another havok version.

No. I need to make another tool, when I'll get reports if the textures in game were 512x512. Nobody answered yet. I found these in TFC files, and I want to be sure this is what we need.

Aha, thanks. This batman is NPC. I see NPC textures are all 1024x1024 here. Characters are 512x512. Ok, now I'm ready to make a tool.

What do you mean "go along with" JeanGrey_ClassicXMen_Spec ?

p.s. found it. For some strange reason developers put those into "textures.tfc", and not in "CharTextures.tfc"

p.s. found it. For some strange reason developers put those into "textures.tfc", and not in "CharTextures.tfc"

That is strange, but thanks. Just need to figure out how to extract them now... I'm not very smart at this sorta thing (yet). :3

You can't extract them now, because my tool currently only supports chartextures.tfc

It's always better to ask in the thread for infinite crisis.

I don't have reports that it needs to be updated. If the file is 0kb that means the tool suspected there was a model, but it was not. What package was that?

About animations, as I said I never worked with havok. You can't get bones probably because the tool you're using is for another havok version.

it was the desert armor batman..........i only got the cape

sigh i hv no words to respond with that comment but as far as the textures are concerned..............the cape is just fine while the actual body looks like this


AGAIN...........WHEN I IMPORT IT.............THE TEXTURE CO-ORDINATES BAR IS RED.......WHILE FOR THE CAPE MODEL AND OTHER MODELS FROM INFINITE CRISIS IT IS GREEN MEANING THAT THE MODEL WAS EXPORTED SUCCESSFULLY WITH CORRECT TEXTURE CO-ORDINATES WHILE THE BODY HAD INCORRECT CO-ORDINATES.

Ok, I'm not a modeller, but I've seen this in many games, and this is not unusual to have texture coordinates be over 1. Meaning the texture is wrapped many times on a model. This is probably why "BAR IS RED".

Also in Infinite crisis at least half of models have texture coordinates scaled to 0.5 and this is probably you have it looking wrong. Hope it helps.

I checked and if I don't scale UVs it looks exactly like yours. So you have to scale them. Find someone who can explain how to do that in Max. This will be helpful to you anyway.

Sorry to ask again, but how do I fix some of the textures, such as some of the cape textures, and stuff like Angel_Logo.

I have been searching for a answer for a while so I don't bother you. Thanks in advance.

Well, this is not too easy as it will require HEX editing. I've sent my code to gildor and when he have time he will update Umodel. But if you really wanna do it now, try this:



This is DDS file, X size is yellow (200 hex = 512), Y size is green (200 hex = 512) and its marked as DXT1.

But this guess was wrong, because I was not going to scan all game packages to detect each texture props, so you can edit it manually.

In case of this file, change number 2 in yellow field to 1. This will correct texture size to 256x512
And change red number from DXT1 to DXT5 below.

Ah, yes, I remember that now. Since I'm busy with many other games, I didn't reply.

So this must be possible, but really a waste of time to make custom exporter for a standard format. I thought if you find a version of Havok used to make this game, you can import these files. What the professionals said about that? If that's impossible, can they tell why?

what do you need? a rigged model? I hope you don't need animations, because they are compressed and I think only havok can decompress it.

Sorry if this makes me seem really impatient, but I have to ask...

When will the level textures and the like be available? I am just curious because as I look through the models, I notice a large number of props and weapons (used by characters in-game, like guns and stuff) are not included the chartextures file. Also the same with certain other textures, like the before mentioned Jean Grey model.

Also, when uModel gets updated with the Marvel Heroes script thingy, will that also include the files stated above?

Hope it becomes available soon.  I am so sorry to ask this again, don't wanna impose.

Thanks for everything.

Ok, if gildor is not going to support this game any soon, then i'll make extractor for all other textures. Can you ask him or check his forums? So I can save my time?

As far as I know, I don't think so, I figured if he was going to have done it, he would have done it a while ago. 

But I will ask him to make sure.

Thanks again.

EDIT:
Found this post on the forums, stating that he would have to rewrite uModel just for this one game:
"Hi,
I'm unsure if Marvel Heroes textures worked before at all. It shouldn't, unless you had some older game version which had "standard" TFC system. I started to work with MH TFC some time ago, but later I found that I'll need to rewrite UModel for supporting just this one game, and I stopped spending any time on it. "ReadMarvelHeroesTFCManifest" (see crash log) should read TFC directory information from some non-standard file, and I see that UModel crashed on this file, so I think its format has been changed."

Sent you a PM with the files. Are these what you want? These seem to be only for the lighting however.

Also will this access the textures in the textures in the 'textures.tfc' file? Sorry for asking for so much.

Tool updated.

I asked for those "lightning" files because they are small. I think it must also unpack textures.tfc

Would it be possible to update the tool for non-square textures, such as the 128x1024 hair or 1024x512 hulk head/pants? Apparently I'm unable to edit the hex properly for converting the files myself. Thanks.

Its possible, but I'm not gonna do it. Requires a lot of work: unpacking and parsing ALL game packages to get properties for each individual texture.

So if you only need 2 or 3 textures, post them here, and maybe someone will correct headers for you.

Yeah... I need 30+, kind of why I was attempting to modify the headers myself. I know that there are 1:1, 1:2, and 4:1 ratio textures, 512x512, 512x1024, and 1024x128 (h:w) for example. I had the thought to make a zip with 3 folders to that effect, it will take a while to track the files down and place them in their corresponding folders. How much work is it to modify the code to extract these 3 ratios into their own sub directories?

This is not much work. But before wasting time on sorting textures, let's make some tests, to find which will be the best way to sort them.

My hex editor is HxD. I used maxi-pedia's decimal to hex converter to get the numbers to enter which did not exactly work.

I need help. Every time i start extracting the textures, it only extracts the norm textures of nightcrawler and electra but nothing else. Am I doing something wrong? Thanks for your time.

If they did, do you think you can update the tool? And if I did somrthing wrong can you tell me what it is? Much appreciation!

I can confirm they have not changed file formats, and the tool still works perfectly.

In an empty folder, you want these items:
Marvel_heroes_tfc
Izo2.dll
Izo2_64.dll
TextureFileCacheManifest.bin
Textures
CharTextures

And you just have to drag the 'TextureFileCacheManifest.bin' over the Marvel_heroes_tfc file, and it should extract flawlessly.

I did what you said and it stops at texture 129 and crashes

The tool is crashing again, mine at 135. File sizes have changed again and will continue to do so as they add heroes, team-ups, and costumes to the game.
Is there a way to future proof the tool, so long as the file formats remain unchanged, by the tool ignoring changes in file sizes?

Tool always ignores file size. If they only add some textures, tool will still work. If it crashes, it means they changed the FORMAT.

You should not ask it here...
Just follow that topic and with a little patience I guess you can do it yourself.
And unfortunately no, they're with no bones.

Would it be possible for the source code to be released so that if need be others can change how the output files are handled without having to bother you about it? I'm looking at how the developers used the same name (hair.tga) for at least 3 different diffuse maps (they are black, red, and white), I am wanting to dump duplicate files into subdirectories if found.

No, this is not fixable. Because without headers, there's no way to tell these RGB images from usual DDS.

But you can always take raw data here and make your correct headers yourself.

So all I could find on decompiling C# was JetBrains dotPeek. Screenshot of the tool [http://smg.photobucket.com/user/SciBott ... k.jpg.html](http://smg.photobucket.com/user/SciBott/media/Marvel%20Heroes/Tools/dotpeek.jpg.html). I can't make heads or tails of this, my only experience with coding is basic html, css, xml, and Megazeux Robotic. The main reason why I wanted the source code as my understanding is that it's fairly easy to read, understanding/comprehending it is another matter. here are a few pieces of code I have found that I wanted to add to play with to see if it would achieve what I had previously mentioned: [https://www.codeproject.com/Questions/2 ... ing-csharp](https://www.codeproject.com/Questions/212217/increment-filename-if-file-exists-using-csharp)

This tool is a workaround. Most textures will be ok. If not, you need to set format and size manually. For this, you need this tool:
[viewtopic.php?f=18&t=16461](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=18&t=16461)

rename file to ".raw" before using it, and set offset as "80"
