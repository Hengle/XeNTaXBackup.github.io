- Post Title: [PS3] God Of War .BIN Audio file (MP3)

Good night,

I'm friends with a great design Dubbing games God Of War - Ghost Of Sparta and Chaos Of Olympus for PS3, since I edit the Videos that are in the format. WFP'm using tools to extract vgmtoolbox Tools and SDK Sony to Crair new. WFP.

However I have a small problem arose some audios mono files that are in. BIN using Sound Forge Pro I can see that this file is actually an MP3 file with some thing in the header, however I am trying to edit and I'm not getting, is anyone can help us, please.

I really need to edit this file.



Here you can follow our progress of dubbing.

hi, a barbarian solution : 

- download dragon unpacker and use hyperipper tools and save all position 
- use HXD and go to position(CTRL+G) cut/paste in new one  and rename to mp3, play-it 

 example here att_060_caves_eng.bin with 1 mp3 file inside, postion of begin mp3 = 944 

```

Thanks for the help buddy, I'll figure out how to put an end of file? in this case it att_060_caves_eng see several bytes at the end, and if I change the mp3 file that will be lost.
