- Post Title: Anyone still keeps a copy of OGLE src?

It's OpenGL Extractor, a plugin of GLintercept.
Both the original site of OGLE and its backups are down(for years), plus there are no files in its SourceForge project.

I hate it when I have to assign every face to certain materials. In some cases, this is no easy job!
I wish I could get the meshes or groups automatically assigned to their original materials while dumping. 

So I am really in need of the src to make this improvement.

Someone still keeps a copy of OGLE src, help me plz?

Not how this area of forum is supposed to work (tool requests go elsewhere i believe), but i guess i will say web.archive.org is your friend....
