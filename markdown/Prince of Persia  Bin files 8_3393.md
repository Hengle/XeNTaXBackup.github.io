- Post Title: Prince of Persia : Bin files 8/

Hey guys it's me again.
After I ripped all three old PoP games out with the help of Persianrug and Xpert(there's a plugin to rip .bf-files out), I landed on a new wall:
Bin-files
While the game has indeed tga,obj and mtl-fileformats , the biggest part where all the Skins and textrues are hidden is compressed  in bin-files mostly.

I wanted to ask:
 can someone look inside those files? I have uploaded the SoT-textures soon will follow the WW-textures. Each is 300 MB big.
I would like to post it directly, but I was banned from an other forum because it was declared as ''warez'',whatever that means.
I uploaded an example for skin-texture:

I think the most textures (the fonts, the main menu's popww logo, main menu's background logo 100%) compressed (maybe 8.8.8.8 ) DDS without header.
