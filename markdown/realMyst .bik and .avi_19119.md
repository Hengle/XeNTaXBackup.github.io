- Post Title: realMyst .bik and .avi

Guys i have some translated pages and i wanna test but when i use the RAD video tools for creating a new .bik file with them in game the pages doest show up. I tried with converting the original file to .avi file and back to .bik without editing the file itself (just converting to .avi and back to .bik) and again it doesn't work. So it must be from the settings for creating the file. I have added both types of files used by the game and some of the translated pictures from one of the file. If someone can help me understand how to make the pictures to load in the game it would be great.


Original files from the game:

The pictures that i want to test with:

I gave up. I think the problem was in the settings or in the game.
