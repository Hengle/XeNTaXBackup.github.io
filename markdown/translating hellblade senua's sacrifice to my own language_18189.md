Ok, sounds great...
I unpacked .PAK file from this path : Game installed folder/HellbladeGame/Content/Paks/HellbladeGame-WindowsNoEditor.pak
I unpacked it to another drive to not make this folder busy. so... then I found game texts here : HellbladeGame/Content/Localization/Game/en/Game.locres
then I export this .locres file using "Unreal Engine 4 .locres (Text tool by swuforce)" and did some edits and then just import it to a NEW_Game.locres file.
I have a problem now. I dont know what to do with this edited file. how can I use it to make the game read this new one not that is in .PAK file?
I just went to my Game installed folder and even there wasn't a folder named "Content" in "HellbladeGame" folder, I simply made this path by adding folders : HellbladeGame/Content/Localization/Game/en
... and paste my new Game.locres file there. but still the game is using Game.locres that is in .PAK file not my new file.
How can I fix it?
