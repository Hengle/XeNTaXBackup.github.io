- Post Title: Tianji online mdx2

Hello! I have unpacked this game and there are not textures at least for mount models, it's very strange, there is a possibility that these mdx2 contains the textures too?, I was searching info about it, but seems like doesn't or at least not in the past, file size of the file seems a bit suspicious because the polycount of the game assets are low, so hope it contains the texture  . Any advice gonna be awesome!

I completely rewrote my Tianji Online .mdx2 loader module I made 4 years ago based on the sample files I got from other users.
These (old) .mdx2 files use external texture files.

If you open the new .mdx2 file, my program extracts the .png file(s) from the .mdx2 files automatically if the Tools/Options/Import #2/Tianji Online – Extract the .png file(s) from the .mdx2 files after load parameter is on (default=on).

I have released the following program:
- 3D Object Converter v10.010 (Windows)

How to get the 3D Object Converter v10.010:
Download the 3D Object Converter from [ http://3doc.i3dconverter.com](http://3doc.i3dconverter.com) and install it or download and use the portable version (if you don’t have it yet).
(Or just use the Help/Check for updates... function to get the v10.010.)
