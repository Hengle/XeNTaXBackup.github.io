- Post Title: DRIFT SPIRIT Extracting [ Newer Models ]

Hi, I wanted to know if it was possible to extract Drift Spirits newer models. Since it's going to be the first time ever that i extract something. I wanted to know how do I get the game on the PC? Also how can I install the app since its unavailable in my country? Thanks for any kind of help.
