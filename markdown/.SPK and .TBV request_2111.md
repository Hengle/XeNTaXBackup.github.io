- Post Title: .SPK and .TBV request

Been looking for quite sometime now for a program that will extract these formats,came across MultiEx Commander and was impressed at all it supported but sadden once again to not see .TBV and .SPK supported. The following games have these formats...pro bass fishing 2003 for .tbv,trophy hunter 2003,deer hunter 2004,deer hunter 2005. Will these be in future versions or can someone even do those? These games do not have much to them for addons and hoping with some extraction can mod or even use some files to upgrade in appearance. Crossing fingers and so glad to have found this forum! Thanks in advance for any help for these formats.

Cool.
But I dont think anyone is gonna want to download a HUGE file for just certain things.
its easier if u use the Xentax File Cutter tool to cut the file so any one of us can analyse it and stuff.
One more thing tho.
Il tell you before someone else does it But Dont double post within hours of your last post, try adn at least wait 24 hours, U couold have just aded that info to ur last post lol.

.tbv (Bass Fishing)

There seem to be two types of archives. One looks compressed the other not. The compressed one begins 00 and then TMSAMVOH

Standard tbv - begins (TBVolume) so for standard here are the specs.

String - Null Terminated (TBVolume) 
Short - Unknown (version?)
Int - Number of Files
Short - Unknown
String - Null Terminated

Table begins at 0x31  (Loop * Number of files)
Int - Unknown (looks like an ID - checksum or something)
Int - Offset


From offset:
String - (Filename)
~ Nulls pad until header is 32 bytes
Int - Size
(Data follows directly after this)


That is about it. Pngs have headers. Sounds have headers so extract and it should be good.

Fishing.tbv & Interfaces.tbv are the ones that are not the same.
