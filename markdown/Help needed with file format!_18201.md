- Post Title: Help needed with file format!

Hi, guys.
I need some help opening this file format called .nsx 
There is a program called 3D Object Converter that is able to open the .nsx file format and display the 3d models, but there's another part to the .nsx file that I'm unable to open.This type of .nsx file holds the animation data for the 3d models used in the game 'Rumble Fighter'.

I could sure use some help viewing these animation files. I wanna study the animations used in the game.

I can provide a link to the NSX file here in my dropbox link below.
