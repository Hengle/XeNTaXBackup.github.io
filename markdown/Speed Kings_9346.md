Hello,

I am looking forward if it's possible to unpack/load these files from Speed Kings game. Model quality is great and definitely worth it. Noesis plugin will be very appreciated, and textures are not most needed (can be dumped via Dolphin). Attached are samples of traffic cars, bike and a biker. Thanks!
