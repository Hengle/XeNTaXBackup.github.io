Listen, yes. Convert, not just yet 

AWB files are archive containers as identified by the AFS2 in the header.

They ususally contain HCA also known as High Compression Audio / ADX2) audio files and these files *at this time* can only be listened to using the CRI Atom Viewer. Some can be converted but these specific examples you provided are not decodable.

If you split the .AWB archive using either a hex editor or VGMToolbox into the individual HCA files you can listen to them using the CRI Atom Player.

The stg_001_001.awb is just dialogue though.
