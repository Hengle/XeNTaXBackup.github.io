- Post Title: PS3 Ftp transfer

I transfered a 14Gb from My Computer to my hacked PS3 using Multiman and Ftp. But it results a 6Gb file in the PS3 hard disk.
I retried several times but no change. I also transfered some other files and the result size is always smaller than its origin in my computer.
I don't know why...
Can anyone explain this to me?
Thank you for reading.

Perhaps the file you were transferring ended up being compressed? Check your settings first.
