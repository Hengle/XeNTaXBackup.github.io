So I managed to get the character files for this game but they're encrypted in nap, so I was wondering if someone could figure out a way on how to decrypt them.

Here is a download link for the character files:

Is there really no one who knows how to decrypt them? Would appreciate any help.

Since I have no idea how to decrypt the files, I am still wondering if there's someone out there who might know.
