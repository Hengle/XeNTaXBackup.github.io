- Post Title: unpack .arc file from "Re ZERO Starting Life in Another World The Prophecy of the Throne"

I unpacked the game "Re ZERO Starting Life in Another World The Prophecy of the Throne" voice file
but extracted 28000 per .ogg files，Not classified in any way 
I want to find some clues from other folders to classify audio files.
Then I found the .arc file named usound，
I tried many methods, but I couldn't unpack it.
If anyone has any other clues to quickly categorize the messy audio files by character, I would be very grateful
