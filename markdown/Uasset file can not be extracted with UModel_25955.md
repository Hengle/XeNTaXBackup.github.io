- Post Title: Uasset file can not be extracted with UModel

Hello.
I want to extract the music files from a game called "Evil Nun the broken mask" and sometimes listen to them (no illegal use is planned). I already extracted the .uasset und the .ubulk files from the .pak file. However, if i want to turn these files into .ogg files, using UModel from gildor, i alway get an error. A picture of this error is attached. Which mistake do i make and how can i get the ogg files? I have the AES Key for the PAK file

I uploaded them. Since i was unable to post them here i used a website which offers file upload. You find 2 .uasset files and 2 .ubulk files behind the link. If this are not the files you need or if you need more samples, just tell me.

@StefanABraun: You're replying to a bot, it's just reposting stuff, modified through re-translation. As for the audio, it's native UE audio with Bink encoding and I don't think it's supported anywhere yet due to custom engine specific header. I can only suggest to submit samples to vgmstream github, maybe they'll add support for such format, actual data starts with "ABEU" in uasset (UEBA, UE bink audio, [sources](https://github.com/EpicGames/UnrealEngine/tree/46544fa5e0aa9e6740c19b44b0628b72e7bbd5ce/Engine/Source/Runtime/BinkAudioDecoder/SDK/BinkAudio)) and to the end of ubulk.
