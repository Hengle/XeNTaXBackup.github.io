- Post Title: Hex Editor help

I found one of your topics involving a certain game 
[viewtopic.php?f=16&t=9121&hilit=syndicate](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=9121&hilit=syndicate)
and I'm unfamiliar with hex editing, so if someone could tell me what I need to be looking for when it says DXT1 to DXT5 or just a plain tutorial video if it covers it in some sense it would be much appreciated. 

Also apologies if this is the wrong thread for this, haven't had the need to post till now.
