- Post Title: need help with mmod model file

hello everyone,

I am part of a smal group of people that atempt to modifie the pretty unknow yet very fun game batllestations midway.
we have been able to do a lot (for people with relatively little knowledge of programing), but we have a mayor problem.

there is no way for us to open the mmod file format the game uses, hence we cannot include new models into the game......
we have had serveral (3) people coming to our community whitch investigated the moddelfile, but they all misteriuosly vanished.(its true)
We also contacted Eidos, who develoed the game, several times, but they are reluctant to help us.

Ironicly eidos was bought by Square enix recently and they shut down the hungary devision of eidos... 
that devision was the one who develped battlestations midway and pacific. (they did it probably because pacific was a big flop)
So there is no one that cares about the game anymore, yet they also refuse to release any tool or info for us to use.

So getting to the point, this is a last resort.

can someone help us?

ps. one of our members discovered quite a few things, but he vanished without a trace as well
      if anyone is interested and able to help, i wil show him the things he discovered
