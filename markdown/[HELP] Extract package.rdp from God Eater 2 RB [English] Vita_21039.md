I can't get your links to work.  Can you check them?

I don't know how big the file is, but if you could re-upload part of the start of the file, it might be enough to analyse it.

Thanks.

I've had a quick look.  It seems as though this .RDP file is compressed somehow.  That BMS script definitely won't read it as it seems to have been made for a different (or uncompressed) RDP file format.

There doesn't appear to be any sort of file table in this RDP file.  Are there any other files available you can upload for analysis?

Thanks.

Hello, DKDave

Sorry, but nope. This is its only file. 

It is strange, because many people have said that this script actually works for it.

Sorry, but do you think it's possible for you to rewrite a scrip to extract it?

In a bad case, I might have to download a PC's Archive of it to test this script. But I'm not sure if it works or not.

I am visualizing that some people have used a other script to extract this instead of the above script.

Maybe that script works for God Eater 2, but not Rage Burst.  It seems as though they've changed something, maybe encrypted this file in some way, and that script definitely doesn't work.

There isn't any recognisable information in the file, such as a file table or filenames, which leads me to believe it's encrypted or compressed.  I've tried that script on Rage Burst for the PSP and it doesn't work on that either.

I could definitely write a script for it if I knew how the information was stored, so hopefully somebody can give us a hint!

Hello, just received a report from my friend.

Scrit BMS fully works with Archive files from PC ver. )

He is sending me the extracted files from it.

So I can assert that this script only works for PSP and PC ver, not for Vita as some people always claim it worked before. 

Btw, thank you DKDave for try hard help me. Thanks sir.
