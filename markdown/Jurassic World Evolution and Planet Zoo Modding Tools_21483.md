- Post Title: Jurassic World Evolution and Planet Zoo Modding Tools

Today is the day, Mod tools have been released after months of hard work by Hendrix, Neptune and I! Please head on over to the two pages for both the tool set and the blender plugin. Make sure to read both readme's as they contain installation, tutorials and troubleshooting instructions. Any issues can be reported to the bug tracker on the GitHub website. I hope you all enjoy the start of the modding scene for both Planet Zoo and Jurassic World Evolution!
