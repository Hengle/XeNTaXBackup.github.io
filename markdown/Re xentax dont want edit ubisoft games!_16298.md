What exactly is a lie about their engines? 

And I bet that this meaningless thread will be also locked/deleted.

Hi GHOST DEAD

I locked your topics because they were confusing and/or were defamatory towards a games company. The two threads here:
[viewtopic.php?f=35&t=16293](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=35&t=16293)
[viewtopic.php?f=10&t=16294](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=16294)

Are not of acceptable nature and pose no worthy discussion due to how confusing they are (the intentions of the post are very inclear and it's hard to follow what you're getting to).

Edit: Now you're being defamatory towards Xentax. Nobody has prevented you from sharing any tools or information. You never shared tools in those other threads and nobody has removed any links from your posts (your threads were only locked).

Cheers.
