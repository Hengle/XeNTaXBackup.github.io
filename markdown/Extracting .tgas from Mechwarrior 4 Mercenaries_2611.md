- Post Title: Extracting *.tgas from Mechwarrior 4 Mercenaries

Hello. I downloaded MultiEx Commander earlier today and tried to extract some *.tga files from inside a *.mw4 file used by Mechwarrior 4: Mercenaries. There seems to be some sort of error though, as I cannot view the *.tgas once extracted.

I'm thinking that the files come in pairs. For each *.tga file, there is a file with the same name and {hint} after it. For example... the file alphamoon.tga has alphamoon.tga{hint} right below it. It is the same for each *.tga. 


Can someone tell me how I can properly extract the *.tgas?


And on another note, I saw that mw4 is listed under the "cannot modify" list. Can anyone point me to a program that would let me actually modify the *.mw4 files? 

Thanks!
