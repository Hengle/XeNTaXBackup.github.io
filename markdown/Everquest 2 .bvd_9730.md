- Post Title: Everquest 2 *.bvd

Hi,

i downloaded the current free2play version of Everquest 2 and tried to extract the gamedata using Blaz (eq2.blazlabs.com) old tools.
sadly his extractor only supports the old *.vpl format which is no longer used by the current client. i think the new file is the "clientvdl.bvd".

perhaps anyone can find out the format of this file?

clientvdl.bvd download: [http://www.mediafire.com/?z6kxd7mf618dijz](http://www.mediafire.com/?z6kxd7mf618dijz) (~4mb)
complete client download at everquest2.com  ~13gb
