- Post Title: Farming Simulator 2015 Gold Expansion DLC files

Hello everyone, with the recent addition of the gold expansion to farming simulator 2015 and the fact that i am a modder i was wanting to make my own personal version of the new Sosnovka map however i am unable to do so due to the fact that the files for the dlc are in a .dlc file format that i have never seen before, not only that i have been unable to find a way to open that file type in order to extract the files from it. Would anyone here who has the game and the dlc happen to know how to go about doing this? I would appreciate any help.
