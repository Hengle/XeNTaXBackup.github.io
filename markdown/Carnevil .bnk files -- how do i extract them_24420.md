- Post Title: Carnevil .bnk files -- how do i extract them?

i got bored one night and decided to poke around carnevil's files using the Carnevilraw and Carnevilpart tools on this thread: [viewtopic.php?p=160064#p160064](https://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?p=160064#p160064)
i know that the sounds and music are in BNK files, so i was wondering if there was any way to extract the music and sounds from those files.

i ask because in the files i spotted this weird PORTIS1.BNK file. taking a look inside with notepad++ only really gave me this and honestly it raises more questions than it answers for me:

i'm really, really, really, really not good with coding or anything like that but i am pretty curious to figure out how to extract the audio from at least that one file because i'm curious as to what that file is, like if it's some leftover file from testing or if it's just a level soundtrack under a weird name.

Can you upload the file?  If it's too big, maybe use file cutter to get a smaller part of it needed.
