- Post Title: 3ds Ram Dump

This is a guide for current 3ds ram dumping method.

First you need a 3ds with firmware <= 4.5

2nd you need a 3ds compatible ds flash cart or a friend with one to install
the initial gateway loader.

After you install the gateway loader you need to put
fcramdump
on your normal sdhc flash card.

Now you can only dump retail carts that are compatible with your region 3ds.
Load up your game and get to the point where you want to dump ram from.

Then go into the system menu and launch the ds profile exploit and it will dump the game ram to your sd card.

The dump should be around 130mb.

If anyone has ram dumps they want me to help with let me know.

This can be used to dump audio and model data.

Am very much hoping someone posts something from bravely default, would really like to see the models from that game (including the world map, nobody seems to have extracted world maps from any JRPGS).

Looking at the format now.

yeah you can't use it in gateway mode.
to test it just boot your 3ds from a complete power down and launch launcher.dat should just start dumping ram.
you should never go into gateway mode.

Oh Chroxx! This is the coolest thing ever!

My only problem is I don't have a 3DS compatible flashcart and my firmware is too high now, so theres no way of me dumping at all, I'm on 7.3.0 -17 E (assuming E is Europe), so essentially I'm screwed here...

For those of us who aren't able to rip the game, but are really curious how the character models were constructed, would it be possible to bring Agnes or Tiz into Max or Maya, or even blender, and just record a short video, or some pictures of the character from various angles, with wireframe overlay on/off, just so we can see quite how they went about it and what the polycount actually is.

Would that be possible at all, if not, something like P3d.in might also work, but people might be able to rip models from there, I don't really know.

Hello. Just found this topic, and I have a request... My 3ds operates somewhere in the 9.X range. Would it be possible for you to provide a ram dump of the audio in Kid Icarus: Uprising?

Hey Chrox, any change you could share the noesis BMD viewer you're using?

I've also notice the files load up fine with your cgfx noesis plugin too (since header for the original extracted files is bcres I assume you renamed them all to .bmd, is that right?).

Are there any plans to support texture too, the textures for characters seem to be in .amx files wheras for stages and equipment they (I assume) are in the index.fs files (as models are crowd.fs, rename .fs to .bmd or .cgfx and they load in noesis no issues).

Hey Chroxx,

I will be trying this method in the next few days, and I wanted to ask what the format of the dumped RAM is, I assume its either all individual files (ie: your bravely default screenshots) or its a single dump.bin, and if so how do we extract from the dump.bin (guessing at the name of course).
