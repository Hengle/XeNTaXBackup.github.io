hi mate,
use the TTG tools unpack and repack loca. files.

-- open ttg tools
-- Auto (De)Packer
UNPACK -- (from the list on the left coose=land) Decrypt: land files = text files
REPACK --  (from the list on the left coose=land) Encrypt: text files = land files

warning

Open the TTG tools
First, edit Settings



Two, all the .land files put the \input files
three, Unpack to when, all the txt files in \output files, put the \input files
last, do repack, all the translation files = output files.

sorry bad eng.

All .landb files are from Tale From The Borderlands.
here : [http://www59.zippyshare.com/v/bTd44Ue9/file.html](http://www59.zippyshare.com/v/bTd44Ue9/file.html)

Maybe the reason I can not run this TTG program because I'm running with x32 Win7, but the program itself made for x64?
Or I need to reinstall something like .Net?

Edit : Font, Hex Editor, DDS < I think its not important for me right now... no need to worry about it, thanks for your concern 
Currently I just need to extract .landb > .txt first 

it would be great if I can contact you @ Steam, I will pm if you are ok with this.
