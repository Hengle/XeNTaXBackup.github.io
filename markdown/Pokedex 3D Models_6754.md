- Post Title: Pokedex 3D Models?

Pokedex 3D has extremely high res looking 5th Gen Pokemon. And, it seems that there are 2 3DS Roms currently circulating(with no way of playing them at all), Super Monkey Ball 3D and that Tom Clancy RTS.


If we can somehow get the free Pokedex 3D rom file, I'd like help to figure out how to crack it open to reach the Pokemon files inside, models and textures and all.

So, if anyone can get the rom somehow,and get the models and textures extracted and uploaded, that'd be nice.
