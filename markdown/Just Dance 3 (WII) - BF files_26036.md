- Post Title: Just Dance 3 (WII) - BF files

Hey!!

I’m having a hard time opening a .bf file from the Wii game Just Dance 3. I tried using Parallels and native Mac JRE openers but so far, nothing has worked. I am only working with a MacBook here so if someone is willing to open up the files for me I’d DEEPLY appreciate it!
