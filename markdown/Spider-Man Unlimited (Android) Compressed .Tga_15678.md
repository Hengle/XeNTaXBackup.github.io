What are you trying to do exactly? One thing I can tell you is the main character TGA's aren't actually targa's, they're containers. Extract them with Winrar or 7zip and you'll get two PVR files, one for the colors and the other for the alpha. Those open fine in PvrTexTool. After that you can save them as a different format.

Welcome and me too. I have more requests for models from this game than any other and I can't seem to crack it. Though I'm terrible at scripting so it goes without saying. Just keeping my fingers crossed.
