BTX files store textures and can be converted with some of the tools made for Danganronpa: Ultra Despair Girls.

BNC files are model files very similar to the ones found in that Danganronpa game I mentioned but none of the tools work with them.

I also wanted the models of the protagonists but there's basically no one interested in reversing the models of this game, which is sad.

You can convert the textures with this Noesis script: [https://zenhax.com/download/file.php?id=7562](https://zenhax.com/download/file.php?id=7562)
