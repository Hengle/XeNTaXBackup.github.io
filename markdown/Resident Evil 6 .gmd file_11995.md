- Post Title: Resident Evil 6 *.gmd file

I'm translating Resident Evil 6 with "Resident Evil 6 Text Editor v1.0", with this tool, I can not edit text easy, because I usually use notepad++ to translate and replace everything neccessary. Anyone can create a tool or make a script can import and export text from *.gmd file? Here is info about this file:



Thanks!
