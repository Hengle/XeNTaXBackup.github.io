Wow, a quadruple post.  Nice.  Dude, if someone has either the time or knowledge they contribute.  But when folks are rude they don't bother.  I wouldn't expect much with your current attitude.

I wouldn't have to post multiple times if people wouldn't ignore the topic. As I said, the file is from GRID. Also it is NOT an image file, I already tried that.

Well i tried to modify the headers to make "compatible" with some header compression xd/pcm, and the audio looks compressed with a some variant of dpcm, i can heart the music, but it's bit distorted, i tried with a lot of audio editors to open and reconvert to normal pcm, actually i CAN'T

Sorry to answer late, still looking for a converor to raw pcm, the game only have the musics in raw (dpcm? or variant)
