- Post Title: Shenmue Noesis Plugin

Noesis and Blender plugins for Shenmue that I worked on. Works okay for most static meshes, including characters, items and maps. Some of the files contain a weird quad format which cause some of the geometry to have a kind of shattered look where every other triangle is standing up that I never addressed. But issues aside it should generally work, and open source.

I'm sorry you haven't gotten more attention for this, but I'm very excited. Thank you so much for doing this, going the extra mile as to redo the work as both a Noesis and a Blender plugin.

well, I've checked three mt5 files using
Noesis Shenmue Model Import Addon

(from the op's github link)

but I don't see any improvements compared to the obj files generated by yazgoo's basic mt5 disasembler:

and
[viewtopic.php?f=16&t=4593&p=145257&hili ... 7s#p145257](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=4593&p=145257&hilit=yazgoo%27s#p145257)
since it seems to use correct object positions.

(didn't check Hellwig's converter mentioned there so far, which was said to be even more accurate)


With iwa_f.mt5 the Kion scripts fails, this is the required correction:
