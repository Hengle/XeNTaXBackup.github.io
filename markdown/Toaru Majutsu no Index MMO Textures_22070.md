- Post Title: Toaru Majutsu no Index MMO Textures

Hello, I have been attempting to rip from the Toaru Majutsu no Index game for a little bit now, It is very easy to obtain the meshes, even the skeletons through the Netease tool, since that game was made by that company, I already have a couple of the meshes I want but there seems to be no easy way retrieve the textures, there are other Netease games that have had their textures retrieved through turning them into KTX files using a script but that doesn't appear to work for this game, it appears the textures are of a different format that I have no way of identifying, I will leave a link of one of the .dat files below, I have been told it is packaged with the mesh as well as the texture, though I am unsure if this entirely true, if someone could look into this I would be incredibly grateful, Thanks.
