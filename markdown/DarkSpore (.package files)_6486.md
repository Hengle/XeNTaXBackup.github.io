Sporemaster tool can atleast unpack it but most files lack proper names.

I think that SporeMaster has the ability to pack files (in Mod tab), or try Rick's Gibbed.Spore.Stuff [http://svn.gib.me/public/spore/trunk/](http://svn.gib.me/public/spore/trunk/)

It's true :O SporeMaster can do it. But if I unpack and repack the file, the original file size is 217kb and the repacked file size is 492kb. The structure isn't the same.

Thanks.

Oh sorry, I forgot that it isn't compiled. I have used Visual C# 2010 Express.
Here is it compiled, but don't know what version of .NET Framework is needed to run it.

Yes, I have already compiled it  Thank you anyway. It works, but the size of the file is 492kb too. I think that the Spore tools doesn't work with Darkspore files.

i checked it, and it works well, almost good... just theres some problem, i just decompressed and repacked the file, but some strings are missing:
Without editing:




After recompress:




After some test translating:




I think the extracting won't work properly, because in the extracted files i can't find "key bindings".
So if someone can edit the tool, it would be great.
