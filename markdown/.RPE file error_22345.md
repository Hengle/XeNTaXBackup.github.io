- Post Title: .RPE file error

I am trying to extract some dialogue from The Da Vinci Code and I'm getting this error with the QuickBMS script.

Error: the specified file number (64) has not been opened yet (src\file.c, 646)

Last script line before the error or that produced the error:
  15  Log FNAME FOFFSET FSIZE FOFFSETX FSIZEX

Hi, I belive that Game Audio Player can read rpe files. I have just tried this with the Buffy game on XBOX ( and it works if you have xbox XBADPCM codecs installed on your computer), which uses the same engine/rpe file format as The Da Vinci Code. 

Scan the rpe file with GAP and it will identify all of the audio files in the rpe container, they can then be saved locally from within GAP.....hopefully this will work for The Da Vinci Code's rpe files too.
