- Post Title: brutal legend - animation (*.AnimResource) files

i've been trying to find a way to open the animation files from brutal legend, but unfortunately i can't seem to find any programs that'll do so.
the files use havok 6.1.0-r1, as seen in this screenshot:


i've also attached three sample files. any help will be appreciated :)

But why? From what I've seen we can't even get the models in the first place, I researched a while ago and other than I think two characters over on DeviantArt using unknown methods there's no evidence of it having been achieved.

Edit: Regardless of models the animations are a moonshot, from what I read nobody even wanted to help with the models in the first place 10 years ago, it's a very niche game. Also Havok is a crazy pain in the ass, maybe you can get it to .hkx in some way and use some hkx tools for other games but unlikely, the only reason it was ever figured out for them (Skyrim, Dark Souls etc) is because they're hugely popular.
