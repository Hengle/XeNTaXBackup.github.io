- Post Title: Assistance/Insight regarding Fantasy models for GMOD

Hey there, first and foremost I'm not the most technically literate when it comes to this sort of work, as I'm still having to learn and develop my skills. My issue is that I'm developing a roleplaying gamemode for Garry's Mod that emulates pen and paper mechanics into the Source Engine, using a fantasy setting. Script, maps, and features I have settled, but my main hurdle right now is models and other materials. Good fantasy models, especially player models with diversity, are nearly impossible to find for Garry's Mod. 

To solve this, my initial gut reaction is to turn towards games like Elder Scrolls Online, which features an editor to make a custom face for a character. Would it be possible to take some game with a similar style, use the editor to make a character, then port that character into the Source Engine? If so, how, and if not, what are my other options.

I'm definitely willing to learn all that I can, unfortunately as I'm sure some of you understand the subject matter is a bit daunting to the uninitiated.

Thank you.
