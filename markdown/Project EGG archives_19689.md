- Post Title: Project EGG archives

I would like some help with Project EGG files. For context, here is a thread on ZenHAX: [https://zenhax.com/viewtopic.php?f=9&t=1345](https://zenhax.com/viewtopic.php?f=9&t=1345)

In summary, Project EGG distributes emulated games as executables including their emulator and a compressed and encrypted disk image. aluigi provided a script that is able to decrypt and decompress new "EGGDATA" files distributed by Project EGG. As of last month, newly-distributed files on the service can still be unpacked using that. However, there are many older files remaining that are not compatible. I would like to figure out how to retrieve track data from those. I am mostly interested in PC-8801 image files, as many games from Project EGG are unique dumps or even undumped titles, which would be great for preservation if it were possible to extract the disk images from the executables.

Some samples are attached in the linked thread, but since it is a paid service, the proper way to get one would be to subscribe for 540 yen/month and download one of the free older titles. For PC-8801, DRAGON 'N' SPIRIT (BGT0001) uses the EGGDATA format, but seems to be incompatible with the QuickBMS script. SPACE DIAMOND (BOT0021) and HOTDOG (BOT0023) are two older free releases that are not in EGGDATA format. Other incompatible titles that I know are YS (FAL0051) and DOME (SAC0002). If you subscribe, be prepared to contact the site support in Japanese to unsubscribe, as I don't think there is an automated way to do so.

If anyone has pointers on how to figure out the older file formats that would be much appreciated.
