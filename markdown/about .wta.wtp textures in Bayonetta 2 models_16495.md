- Post Title: about .wta/.wtp textures in Bayonetta 2 models

Hello! 
Now I'm trying to rip some models from Bayonetta 2. I found model files (.DAT) and textures of them. And, Thanks to RandumTalkingBush's script, finally I finished converting the texture files from GTX to DDS.

However, I'm not sure how to apply those DDS texture files to the DAT model file. I already put them in a same folder, but they don't work. I think that DAT file includes information about reading textures(in .wta/.wtp), but I want it to read not .wta/.wtp ones but DDS ones.

Could someone tell me how to do this?
