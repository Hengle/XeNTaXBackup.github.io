- Post Title: Darkfall Archives

ok so i have gotten the darkfall client, and have been working on it's archives some, from what i can tell, they use an index file dfdata.sfai, that is compressed wit ha modified version of bzip2, after it's decompressed(which i haven't been able to do yet) i'm pretty sure it's also encrypted, as i have seen multiple error strings in the client that suggest it. I'm also pretty sure this file contains the filenames for the other archives. the other archives mostly contain files uncompressed, though i have seen some of the modified bzip2 containers. [http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4692861/Darkfall](http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4692861/Darkfall) is alink to the client, if someone needs me to, i can upload a portion of the .sfai and the .sfad files so you dont have to download the entire client
