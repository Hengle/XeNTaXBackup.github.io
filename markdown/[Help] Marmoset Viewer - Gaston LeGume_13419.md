- Post Title: [Help] Marmoset Viewer - Gaston LeGume

The 3D showcasing website ArtStation uses an embedded form of the Marmoset Viewer to load 3D models into a web browser. Now, a very talented fellow named Kaelin Hinnant came up with a realistic high-poly version of Gaston from Beauty and the Beast, who has not been portrayed in any 3D video game or any other 3D form, as well as two of the original '01 Bionicle Kanohi, so I've been trying to figure out how to rip them from his ArtStation site. I assume it operates on some form of WebGL, but when I tried the 32-bit versions of 3D Ripper DX, Ninja Ripper, 3D Printscreen Via, and OpenGLXtractor on Firefox running the URL "artstation.com/embed/936047", they all turned up with nothing. Is there anyone who can help me crack this format, and is it improper to ask it here?
