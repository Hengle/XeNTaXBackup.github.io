BloodBorne tools.

Usage:
1. unpack .dcx archives with current bindertool
2. drop .flver files onto BloodBorne_model.exe to get models
3. drop .tpf files onto Bloodborne_texture.exe to get textures

Model tool versions:
v1 - first version
v2 - added maps support
v3 - added original model skeleton extraction

Notes about models:
- Multiple UV pairs will only be exported to ASCII.
- to get animation skeleton, you need to put skeleton.hkx next to the tool when extracting. This file is usually found in animation archive of that character. This animation skeleton will not be perfect (some bones may be missing, and can be shifted somehow). This will be fixed later. If no skeleton.hkx file present, skeleton may be in another .HKX file for that model. Rename it to skeleton.hkx for convertion.

New to this forum, but I, too, would be interested in going through the game files. I've platinum'd the game, done just about every Chalice Dungeon imaginable, maxed out tons of weapons, on NG+8, done various playthroughs with a bunch of builds, etc. But I'd love an excuse to get back into anything to do with this game. However, I'm pretty sure sharing the game's files is a legal grey area, so don't hold your breath for anyone to share them.

Alright, I'm really new to Blender, but I can get the model exported to .OBJ files, then imported into Blender. No problem. But I can't seem to get textures displayed properly. Things like the face and hands are okay, but it repeats parts of the texture over and over on the rest of the body. Is there something I need to do to each individual piece of the object in order for the textures to wrap properly? 

Also, is there some way to get textures to display while in 3D View? Having to render each time to see if the texture is correct is kind of tedious. 

Thanks for any help!

Note for people who can't make skeletons working. They are ALMOST correct with only a few rare problems. Most of characters are fully working. If its not working for you, you probably doing something wrong. Take the model and animation skeleton, load them separately and connect in your editor.

If you don't mind, what is the name of the Burial Blade file/folder? I'm trying to get a really close-up look at the inscription/writing on the blade to see how closely it resembles the writing in From Software's new Shadows Die Twice teaser.

Edit: Apologies! I didn't see that you uploaded them!

All new model and texture tools. I'll save 1st version at 1st post in case of problems with new one.



Whats new:

1. fixed some models crashing (because of japanese names. non-standard chars replaced with "_")
2. map assets support
3. textures applied automatically!
- SMD will have material name and after "/" - only name of first texture which is usually diffuse
- ASCII will have mesh number, material name, and all textures, be that 4 or 14 of them
important note: ASCII and SMD files will have texture names as .TIF and .TGA, so you have to either convert textures to these formats, or do text mass replace .TIF to .DDS in ASCII/SMD because they are text files.
4. texture tool will now export DX10 textures with .DX10 extension, so their names will be original, for auto-texturing to work.

Also, are you using Blender for fixing the skeletons? I downloaded the Doll's model from deviantart but there's no way for me to fix the weights in 3ds max, I'd like to know where I could do that.

Now to figure out how to get animations working..

Thanks for the list! Any idea on how to get the .hkx animations working? I have tried to open them in Havok 2014 with no luck. I also tried to convert them to fbx or kf with the hmkcmd tool, but I am pretty sure all of the available tools only work for the Havok 2014 32bit animations, and that these are 64bit. Not really sure what to try next...

You got the set inverted. I also got the same issue, but I have not checked other models.



That is a screenshot from the game. The issue is easy to see when you look at the chest strap.

I know that daemon said we should look elsewhere for game files, but I’m looking for them because I want to make real life versions of the weapons and I need models for it... Maybe that’s not legit enough since I don’t have anything to show people right now but I figured I’d ask anyway.

could you explain how this tool works? I tried to follow the instructions but I can not make the skeleton work.

I'm not a shining example or anything, but I feel like if you've never posted here, and never been involved in the community, you can't just sign up and expect to be sent files so you can wander off again and never return.

Thank you

awesome tool you made, great asset to the community.

EDIT: Weird that its only reporting having 1 post. I have been active within these forums before regarding ARCtool and a script that would allow me to access the Dragons Dogma model files. Pretty much the same shtick as this, someone found a way to access the files for the game (in which I was interested in using for 3d printing) and I created an account back then to interact with the person. Had to work with a script made back in 2009, which only worked with the 2012 version of 3DS Max....pain in the ass but did lead to a fruitful outcome. 

I was in the process of making a compilation of all the extracted models before I lost my harddrive.

its as if I edited my original comment explaining how odd I found that (because I could of sworn I had been active elsewhere), and that my intentions were to release models I was extracting to the public (because its a pain in the ass to get hold of the 2012 version of 3DS max) had not the harddrive I was storing them all on went missing....

anyway, thats enough of this, not going feed this off topic stream of posts.   



Daemon will PM a me link if he wants to or not (would be appreciated!). 

If I do get access, Ill make a link to all the content converted (unless there is an issue with that).

Cheers

Because the DLC is downloaded and saved directly onto the PS4's harddrive there is currently no way of retrieving the DLC files. This is due to the PS4's harddrive encryption. I did throw this question to daemon1 and he more or less verified the answer.  


Im currently working on Ebrietas, but unpacking Ebrietas animation folder (c2510) crashes the bindertool. So Im looking into manually re-creating a basic skeleton for it (never done rigging so it may take me abit).

Is it possible to instead use the GOTY version of the game, which includes the DLC on the disc?

Hi everyone, I just wanted to let you know that I've been able to run the decrypted game on real hardware, so I can restore deleted content to the game and see it running in-game.

I'm posting content on YouTube (starting with the Slug Princess [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCXhNIBBcIE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCXhNIBBcIE)) and lots of twitter as well at [https://twitter.com/manfightdragon](https://twitter.com/manfightdragon) so feel free to follow along and let me know what stuff you wanna see.

Sanadsk just released a video regarding cut dialogue from Maria of the Clocktower.

[https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=wdukoUh4E8E](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=wdukoUh4E8E)

This would suggest accessing the DLC files is possible (via a game of the year edition or otherwise), unless those files were already hidden in the base game (unlikely).

I'll try and contact him to ask him how he did it.

I asked him and he said that he got an older PS4 model that he jailbroke and it allowed him to get the DLC files, which I think you need to get from a version of the game that has the DLC on disc. He won't share the files though haha

Yeah, I doubt he would release the files. 

I havnt used my PS4 in quite some time so chances are its an old enough version to be jail broken (here is hoping). Now I can get my hands of a game of the year edition with relatively no hassle, however I dont know the process on how to dump the files nor the specific jailbreak version required. 


If anyone could share that with me, or PM the details, I would be more than happy to upload a file dump myself.

EDIT: I may have found something, but its abit of a process... am I right to assume I would be using Zecoxao's process to decrypt and dump games on the PS4

Ok, i've been bashing my head into my keyboard for the last hour, so time to look for help.  I've gotten my hands on the bloodborne files but I must be missing some step here.

I am trying to get the Moon Presence (c5400) into blender.  When i go into my chr folder to get the files I find three: 
c5400.anibnd.dcx
c5400.chrbnd.dcx
c5400_2.tpf.dcx

following the steps here I run them all through BinderTool, which gets me
c5400.anibnd
c5400.chrbnd
c5400_2.tpf

I can then run the .tpf file through daemon's stuff and I can look at the textures.  However I cannot for the life of me figure out how to extract the other files.  What am I missing?

Run the .anibnd and .chrbnd through the BinderTool again. *.chrbnd will give you the .flver (which you can then run through daemon's tools), and .anibnd will give you all the animation files, so you can skip that one if you don't plan to mess with those.

Worked perfectly.  Funny how the easy stuff manages to slip by from time to time...

Thanks!

In purchasing the new monster hunter I am required to update my system beyond what is currently hackable. As I was not able to get any confirmations into the process of pulling the models and there being a reasonable risk to my PS4 in hacking it, I decided to update.

If anyone has any requests for any particular files/models I will be happy to throw up a link.

Another opportunity may become available to get the DLC content in the future.

If you download the XPS Tools for Blender you can import the ASCII instead of the broken SMD.

For what need make auto-assign textures tomodel, if that anyway not working and always need assign mesh by mesh?

Someone have auto-loaded textures? I can't,I transformall textures in ,tif and .tga, but Blender and Noesis no read that...

I don't think there is a game out there that exist an option to import with its internal transforms to be placed correctly in the 3D space, they're all split in to parts centered at origin no matter what.
Sometimes transforms for certain assets can be used, but for map geometry its always missing, I never understood why that is never taken in to account, in general that is, not just this game in particular.

It was done for overwatch, and i recently made it for Injustice 2. I dont see much use in such option, considering the size of modern game levels, no editor will be able to even load full levels anyway, not to mention work with it.

I don't think there is the need to be loaded in any 3D editor/software the whole map assets, only by region/zone would be beneficial, same way the game engine loads it, not all at once, and no matter what part is loaded/imported to always be at its initial internal transforms not centered at origin.

For example static meshes should be at least supported by default, I assume those that move or have physics in game might be a bit tricky, but even those should be placed where they originally belong in game.

It would be a game changer to at least have access to the internal transforms for any game map regardless of used engine, for modding different games, interchangeability between them and tests so on and so forth.
After all, its the main reason why we all deal with these game assets, part of the hobby per say, its the ULTIMATE DREAM for a vast majority of us.

For instance I am still going nuts looking for the frostbite internal transforms for maps and vehicles from the NFS series, the EBXs hold almost all transforms for wheel parts, I just cant find the damn map assets transforms, if you have any clues Ss to where they are located, would be AWESOME.

Of course its possible! Just need to figure out where coordinates are stored and how. @manfightdragon from twitter even able to modify coordinates and see results in game. But you need to understand that map models in bloodborne are pretty much high-poly.

ok then, its even easier than getting skinned meshes. Just need to apply transforms. The problem is how to represent the export.

For example, for a decent level, there will be a few thousand static models. How do you expect it to export? A few thousands of separate files? How are you going to check them when they are so many?

As for NFS, people have found the position/rotation data in FBX files for SWBF1/2. Have you checked the same place in NFS?

Lets put it this way, if I unpack the game The Crew for example, by zones it has over 900 assets ONLY for roads and terrain,
they are all split in a puzzle kind of way, they are just extracted same way they where packed, which is normal, and have a helper/bone centered at origin while the actual geometry is not, if I move the helper the geometry moves with it obviously, so all I have to do is import those over 900 manually one by one, then starting to arrange them like a puzzle then to "stitch" them together to form the roads and the terrain in between, if the max script that was created for it would read also the internal transforms, everything would be placed automatically where should, then only issue would remain to apply materials/textures manually.

And that's what I happen to work on it at the moment, importing each and one of them at a time, then arrange them accordingly then stich, so on and so forth, now when comes about buildings and other details/assets, I have no clue how to figure out where they all go, lol, and of course if in the end all look unnatural delete everything and move on to a different approach, and each approach can take between few weeks to few months, it is what it is.

Bottom line is, it does NOT matter how many thousands they all are, as long as they know where they go in the 3D space, period, its irrelevant how they are imported, even if in batch or one at the time.

[Here's](https://mega.nz/#!ntslTLZa!RsejZNX61hLqJA-Slli16ffdke3X29jC729BPJIyN0c) some samples for The Crew if you care to check and see if transforms even exist inside them, maybe you can ease up some of the work, just saying, you never know.

The EBXs for the NFS contain the transforms for the wheels and they're parts, but NOT for roads, terrain, buildings etc etc etc to create the map as in game, maybe they are only located inside the mesh files, cause I doubt the chunks have anything.

Maybe just create smd file with bones placed at right coordinates with model name on them. Then you can import map models that you need,change name of root bone to model name and import that file,it will apply as animation to these and place them right where they need to be placed.

That is not practical what so ever, more tedious in fact.

We only need the transforms to be read from each file individually up on import in to a 3D software, and while importing them one by one they will be placed automatically where they belong, with out the need for extra editing.

I'm sure daemon1 can get that way easier done, he's just concerned about how to import, but that shouldn't be relevant so to speak.

ok if you're ready to import them one by one, thats not a question. When exporting IJ2, I planned to split them into parts, say, no more than 100MB each. But in the end the whole level was only about 200 or 300MB, so it was not required.

> Reply from mono24

> it does NOT matter how many thousands they all are
i still think it is. After importing only 1 million faces into blender, it starts to work slow, i have no idea what happen if you load all the millions that take the whole level. But ok, i can just export them, and you can try loading. I have a number of requests for different game maps, so can you tell me, what is "most wanted" game for you, and I will put it in a queue.

> Reply from mono24

> Here's some samples for The Crew
Checked the files, and there is no information about levels there. Only meshes, textures and materials. You need level layout files to get this information, not model files.

> Reply from mono24

> maybe they are only located inside the mesh files
No, they must be in EBX files. This is how game engine works. Model file is always placed at origin, all the thousands of them. Then, there is one big file (or set of files) - level layout, which lists all the instances of all meshes, and this is where individual transforms are.

Just to make it clear, there are no global transforms in individual files. 

For example there are 10 instances of particular building in the level. There is only 1 mesh file for them all. And there is a big file somewhere, which has info about all 10 with a model ID and transform for each individual building.

Actually most of the models look pretty close to level positions with their pivots at world origin. 
Except instances of course, not that much in fact, which coordinates are located in msb files.

Then why did you say its impossible? Maybe you better choose some NFS game?
Because it is impossible for an end user like myself who has no clue how EBX works, and how to use those weird transforms inside EBX,
I myself id love to try it and do it, but no one is willing to provide information on how to do just that,
I can only figured out transforms and rotation for wheels and they're necessary parts.

And as you mentioned in order to complete a map it requires the instances and other assets setup etc etc etc.
Frostbite at the moment gets all the love and attention, while games like The Crew nothing, its due to being online only,
but the map is amazingly detailed and real life, not a made up fantasy world.

Long story short, I want to port it to NFSMW 2005, because now it will be possible to import custom maps from other games in obj format with materials,
collisions and such, you name it, so the map being huge I want to try by levels/zones, who knows I might be able to try it all and see if it works.
Current development of the tool and info is provided [here](https://nfs-tools.blogspot.com/).
It is a dream for thousands of users out there and its happening and I am one of them too. 
It will support natively interchangeability for the following NFS EAGL game engine:
2003 Need for Speed™ Underground
2004 Need for Speed™ Underground 2
2005 Need for Speed™ Most Wanted
2006 Need for Speed™ Carbon
2007 Need for Speed™ ProStreet
2008 Need for Speed™ Undercover
2010 Need for Speed™ World Online

Now the Chameleon proprietary engine was used for these two games,
and no one knows how to even open map assets yet alone to build the map to be used, to extract cars is a mess for some.
2010 Need for Speed™ Hot Pursuit
2012 Need for Speed™ Most Wanted

And then we have the Frostbite versions with incredible detailed maps too to be ported and tried out, which would be a dream also.
2011 Need for Speed™ The Run
2013 Need for Speed™ Rivals
2016 Need for Speed™
2017 Need for Speed™ PayBack

Well, now you know a good part of my dream that's about to become reality, and my motivation too.

As for The Crew game I've reached at the following stage.
Meshes are imported one by one, takes a few days to get it done on a detailed zone, not all are as complex, or that many thousands of meshes to import
(those in the screenshot are ONLY the roads and nothing else ONLY for a zone still have 5 more zones to go,
bridges, side road assets, fences and other detail are difficult to be placed or as you know require instance option).

Materials/textures are not supported unfortunately, they all have hashes as names 16 char(numbers and letters) each.
I've estimated the way it works and only based on the information I found and research,
it should take me between a one year and half to two years to complete and to guess where textures go.
luigi's bms extraction script makes a mess and cant find a thing. So I am using Ekey's unpack tool.
Right now I have to re-extract the whole game because I am manually building the file list for textures and game meshes
and see if it works to at least be placed in folder structure, so I can know what is what.

If for example you cant or wont be able to do The Crew, just saying, you think you can help me out to at least create a proper extraction tool,
Ekey's tool is incomplete I think, your an expert on details that other devs don't see or do not have the required knowledge.
That would make me speed things up a bunch big time if the whole assets are arranged in they're required folders/subfolders.
Right now they look like this.

I wont give up on this game  I will continue to use any info I find to get it done, even if I will only be able to use the geometry with no mat/tex.
Once again thank you.

I understand I need the skeleton.hkx of the model in question in the same location as BloodBorne_model.exe, then I simply run it with the proper flver model file, and I should get an ascii file and an SMD file, although everyone is saying the SMD file is broken and should not be used, and that the ascii file can be imported into blender.

SMD file is right, good importing into Blender and skeleton fixing. Maybe you have an error with the unique model? Say me a number, maybe I can help (see same trouble with some characters)
For animations, what I know, no one can get it right from original files ds2-3 and BB.

You save it from Noesis? Try also save it from Blender
Or newest XNAlara, I use 11/5
Also, some models have troubles, which one you try convert?

There are plenty of free 3D assets and textures on the internet to use if you're a beginner. Several people have graciously posted fully functional Bloodborne assets to download if you want to use those specifically. If anything, being a beginner will make it harder to work with the raw files because you won't know what you need and how to get it.

You haven't even stated what you want to use the files for, or prove that you're not going to use them maliciously. Do you want to make SFM videos? Are you going to edit the models? Are you making mods? Why should someone give you the files if you have no proof that you're going to actually use them?

Every single one of you that asked for the game files, GOOGLE is your best friend, files have been released all over the internet a VERY long time ago.
If you think you cant find them, look again, they are literally up for grab anywhere, either being on a torrent or downloading links such as zippy/mega etc etc etc.
All you have to do is Google/type/search.

Now to figure out how to get animations working..

Thanks for the list! Any idea on how to get the .hkx animations working? I have tried to open them in Havok 2014 with no luck. I also tried to convert them to fbx or kf with the hmkcmd tool, but I am pretty sure all of the available tools only work for the Havok 2014 32bit animations, and that these are 64bit. Not really sure what to try next...

I installed the 64 bit version of HavokContentTools 2014 64Bit PcXs and  HavokContentTools 2014 64Bit Anarchy but it crashes every time when i try to Start it. but the 32 bit versions runs perfectly smooth but cannot open the animation.

has anyone a solution how i can fix that problem or use that goddamn animations?

Maybe try running it in compatibility mode - it used to work on Win10 until something updated.
It should be able to run the animation just fine, though - did you make sure to import the skeleton and then add the animation?

That said you probably won't be able to export the animations without somebody writing a specific tool to convert BB animations. You can try everything that's [listed here](https://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=17823), but it's not very likely to work. The only person I've seen who converted BB animations was SanadSk, and he never described how.

he is not the only one, many other people were able to convert them with slight changes of the files. I dont remember exact names, but they are present in this thread

Maybe you have 32 bit system? It should work if you have that havok: "HavokContentTools_2014-1-0_20140830_64Bit_PcXs".

It means, will be usable all joints/physics/clothes skeletons like cmd addons?

I would like to point out to you that with regard to hairs, cloaks or similar stuff there is no bone. I would like to know if the problem is because the game uses another system or not?

It's all cmd-file rigging - like additing skeleton. If they're not readable,I think hairs/fur/cloak physical bones impossible..
Wish I wrong

Maria and some dudes have rigged cloaks, for other models and hairs rigging in hkx_cmd files - addition skeleton. Like in ds2 and 3. But Idk - no one I know can use it.

I need example filename of model that has problems with bones.

If there are no problems, no fix is needed, and I will return to other games.

but some object don't have position(building)

Every map is like this, most objects are pretty much placed with their pivots at world origin, except instances and external objects.

By the way, don't forget to mirror models.

Yay! Can U send me that, please? Idk how to get maps fragments with position, and in streams this no good to see

I use personal Tool for making game, so It's very uncomfortable
but you want it, I send you this without unnecessary function.
I used DirectX 9.0 so if you use this tool, you need .x expention.

my tool make with MFC, so it has many bug..

ok since nobody reports problems, it means all models and bones are working properly and no fixes needed. I'm moving to other games.

And I did. What's wrong with asking? If he can't do it that's fine. No need to be abrasive about it.

I tried googling for the files on the "public forum" multiple times and I couldn't find them. Again, If daemon wants to send me files or at least point me in the right direction of where I can download them, it would be appreciated. If not, he won't and I can move on and that's that. No need for the abrasiveness and the like, no offense.

Hello there!

Storybook can you give me some info about the havok? I try the same but my first problem is the havok doesn't work properly on windows 10 64bit. I read we need to use "HavokContentTools_2014-1-1 64bit" but it doesn't work at all for me. What did you use? Then the next step is the endian problem. What did you use for the modification? Thank you for your help! 

Somebody try the same? I just wanna see this animations and learn about the human reaction time. This game is a really good commodity for my learning process.
Thank you for your time guys!

i use HavokContentTools_2014-1-1 64bit and i use window7
if you look at bloodborne .hkx file, this point(red rect) have 01(little endian).
you can load .hkx file for havok tool, if fixing point 00(big endian)

Hello there!

Thank you StoryBook looks like it is worked. I see the main skeleton but if i try an another file from the folder that doesn't show anything in the havok tool (with/without skeleton) like in your case. I saved out one of them in xml format and checked what daemon1 wrote but i found that line in the file.

You just have another pc with win 7 or you are using virtualbox? Because havok x64 doesnt work on win 10.

Hm I use windows 7 64bit in virtual box. If i did what daemon1 write (copy the value in the annotationTracks line) and open it with 64bit havok tool it is work but for me all the time need to modify some other lines (type and duration, duration is 0.00000 just write a number there and it start to move) because i have a big fatal without them. Storybook Do you have any data in these lines for you or you modified them like me?
Oh and one question, does anybody know how can i save this animations in xml format without i need to open it with havok tool? I tried the havok AssetCc1 and AssetCc2 tools but it doesnt wanna work. (Looks like they are not the right tools for this?!) Thank you very much guys the answers and the help!

I use Fallout4 animation kit for transform .hkx -> .fbx
but it's not binary fbx(it's ascii fbx)

finally bone is't rigging mesh.. so mesh was broken when add animation
this problem is very fatal

PS : if you use DS3 max script, mesh name is't coincide bone..

mesh is correctly rigged with original animation skeleton, animation must work fine, and you've seen other people did it

I am a beginner in programming less than a year. and can't speak english well..
so I may have missed the message..  

I think .ascii mesh is very good, because it's have normal, shader, albedo texture's information
so map object is used .ascii, but skeleton is extracted .smd

I try to animation combine, but failed.
With a little mercy. Can you tell me where the topic is located?

So, both .ascii and .smd models are working. If you can't get some .smd, you must use bloodborne tool 1 or import the .ascii, delete the skeleton and import skeleton from skel.smd (need root it to 90* at X-axis)
Here are how I do (all bones are working, I get alot models) [https://drive.google.com/open?id=1dCY1q ... 7cDdMmub5S](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1dCY1qjyvwaDP9LuKD6u1-r7cDdMmub5S)
Here are you can see my small upload collection of BB [https://tokami-fuko.deviantart.com/gall ... bloodborne](https://tokami-fuko.deviantart.com/gallery/?catpath=%2F&edit=0&q=bloodborne)

Gehrman is work fine too 
If you have problems with weapons, you can delete the wrong from model and attach from parts weapon folder.
Or make new weight to weapon.

Yes, Gehrman (but this was on BB tools 1, idk about version 2)
Maybe someone else, but all other is fine.
Ptumerian queen have error when import SMD, but good with Ascii.
Kos (c4530 and c4531) have twisted bones, weight almost good.
Gratia (oo000636) have a skeleton, but no weight (for some objects it no work, but I think this is no big problem - no need for many peoples )
I think this is all in that moments

I have the idea...

Any chance for same tools or adopt that to Dark Souls 2? DS2 scripts not working with almost all models (broken UV and weights)

I think, this will be great - I know alot peoples, who need DS2 models of characters and parts.

Model tool v3 + updated texture tool at the first post

Model tool v3 now extracts original model skeleton. Both in ASCII & SMD, and ASCII has proper bone rotations (updated noesis script to load them included). Unfortunalety not much help from it - additional bones are just submesh bones, nub bones and some more useless stuff. But you dont have to replace skeletons from anim packages anymore, they will work out of the box.

Texture tool now must properly export all textures (including menu)

This is not fully physical bones. More of this is marker helpers bones like dummy bones 1-2-3, "fur up", "fur leg", flame effect, player catch marker and etc.

Hey, so I'm new here and this might annoy some, but I've downloaded the file in the OP and would appreciate if someone could set me up with the bloodborne files so I can extract the player mesh and some armour sets with rigging?

I'm an artist working on a portfolio piece and would love to use the actual Bloodborne character to pose with it.

Here's the piece in question: 

[](https://skfb.ly/6AKWW)

[https://skfb.ly/6AKWW](https://skfb.ly/6AKWW)

Here is another piece I created, and I would love to do the Bloodborne one in the same style with animated character in various poses with my weapon I've created.

Basically I'm just after the player model and the hunter set or something just to pose it with.

^ thanks for the above

However, I'm following the OP and even with various searching I can't actually figure out how to use these tools.

I've attained I need to drag .dcx files onto Bindertool to extract them, and then I drag the flver, tpfs etc onto the mesh extract exes to get those, but I can't seem to get any mesh files that I can use. It seems to output an ascii file, whereas the textures come out just fine?

I looked more and it seemed I needed XnaLara to possibly import them, but even after doing so I can't find how you actually export bones or any rigged mesh from this.

I'm working in 3DS max and so far this is more pain than I thought it would be, so any help on what I'm after would be greatly appreciated.

You can import these files just fine with Blender by using the following plug-in:
[https://www.deviantart.com/johnzero7/jo ... -485668690](https://www.deviantart.com/johnzero7/journal/Blender-2-7x-XPS-Tools-1-1-485668690)

Since Blender can export .fbx, you could use it as a bridge to 3DS.

Hkx is animations by itself. You can import it with havok 2014 x64,read old posts here,it was explained already.

This might be irrelevant by now, but for those of you trying to figure out the animations, there was an animation conversion tool for bb released on PSXHAX not too long ago. It looks like it could be useful to you all. (Am I allowed to link to it?) I don't have the game files yet so I can't quite use the tool/give any results myself.

As far as I know as long as your not going to post illegal documents from a company's SDK like Sony and such, or tools its all safe, just post the tool link here or better yet the page where explains what's going on.

As far as I know as long as your not going to post illegal documents from a company's SDK like Sony and such, or tools its all safe, just post the tool link here or better yet the page where explains what's going on.

Oh of course not! Just a link to a PSX page.

As I said, I can't test or post any results until I get the files, but I think you guys may get some use out of it!

Sorry to keep necro-ing this thread, but I finally got the files! And since Havok 2014 64 keeps crashing (I assume it's cause I'm running Windows 10) is the only way to get it working through some alternate way of running win7?

Hello super new here!  After reading through this I'm actually amazed at the amount of effort put through by the community here.  It's been going on for a long time!  I'm really interested in well....Bloodborne itself, but also all of the other things going on in this thread (the modeling, animations and tools) and was kind of hoping to jump onto this learning effort as well.

If anyone could help me out with directions on where to get the introductory materials I'd be more than willing to show any progress (though I'm an amateur.)

I don't suppose anyone has the files or models still?
Have been trying to find a pkg or dump that has a known password or no password but nothing, even the PSNHAX pkgs have a password that is not multiple zeros or I cannot find the right pkg.

Edit, found one on the PkgLinks reddit.

I know this thread has been pretty inactive and you probably don't care for complete noobs asking for stuff, but I'm kinda desperate here.

How do you get the .dcx files? I've got a .pkg file, but I don't know how to extract the .dcx files from it, or if that's even what I'm supposed to do. Could someone please show me how or where to get the .dcx files?

Well that is what happens when someone just doesn't research at all, all info is available already .
What you need is the correct PKG, because one downloaded from Sony servers, a legit one, will NOT work, you need a Fake PKG of the game to be able to extract with a couple of tools already in existence, such as Fake_PKG_Generator or PS4PKGViewer By LMAN
Then it will extract all needed files, for you to play with, cool right?
have fun

There is noesis script for pc version textures (also some tool i cant find right now that can also repack tpf files), but daemon tool works with ps4 ver of ds3. Also if you mean what you posted in other topic as a problem then its suppose to be like that. Try to inverse colors on whole thing or on some channels, swap them around etc. Actually all useful tools for souls games you can find in discord speedsouls server in #modding.

I already tried with that script but it makes me the same problem. I need correct normals to understand how they are. I would like to try to see if with the ps4 version there is the same problem. is there anyone who could pass me the files?

As i said its not a problem, you need to play with color inversion and channels on normal map, its suppose to be like that, they are correct. I will check ps4 files later and write here if they different, but im sure they are not.

Not true, any PS4 game dependable on firmware up to version 5.05/5.07 is already out and extractable, you can get the game files anywhere online.

You're right. I was just hoping to avoid the trouble and just get the data files, since I'm assuming that's what you guys were sharing considering how quick stuff got done. I'd like them for modding stuff into Skyrim if that matters. But nm guess i'll just eat the pkg. 

for proof I've already succesfully extracted and ported some files from DS3 using the tools found here (cheers daemon and atvaark) into skyrim

Yes, broken UVs and some riggings (especially rigged weapons for the main hero, like fan and chains and more troubles with monsters)
Also - do their textures must be so small? Or it incorrect extracting?

Yabber is better for textures, and for everything in general. It can extract archives and repack them back. Including textures.

Parts without transparency are fine.

Blender importing is fine. Did you use BloodBrone converter or another method for converting FLVER?
I have not get any crash while importing SMD, expect for ASCII is unimportable

Tool for converting sekiro (also bloodborne and dark souls 3 should work) flvers to valve smd format with correct uv's. Its pretty raw so could have bugs.
Also material names dont match with actual texture names. All uv's should be fine.
Made using TKGP SoulsFormats library https://github.com/JKAnderson/SoulsFormats

I also recommend to use yabber for game files https://www.nexusmods.com/sekiro/mods/42/?tab=files

P.S. To use just drag and drop your flvers on to exe.

P.S. Tool Updated

I tried your instrument and discovered that it also works with dark souls 2 scholar the first sin, but not with demon souls. Is it possible to do it also works for demon souls? and then rather than converting them to smd is it not possible to do so in fbx format?

I posted other tool for converting des models to obj in des topic.https://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php? ... 9&start=60
Also no wonder they works, because soulsformats using same class for all these games except demons souls. So even ds1 and ds2 works.

I understand, but I thought it was possible to create a single tool for all souls games. as for an obj format as useful as it is, the fbx format manages to preserve the model in the sense that if the model is divided, it preserves all the parts.

Its not easy to export to fbx from c#, because no library for it. Also yeah its possible to combine them for me, but maybe later.

Hey, guys! I’m new here. I was wondering if someone could send me the pack of character and weapon models also if someone could send me the Yharnam map if it brings the carriage, coffins and dead tree models. if it’s no trouble, of course 

Or if it’s too much, maybe sending me only these models and the yharnam map. Please, and thank you!

New version of flver tool, now supports bones and texture names.
Read "README" for usage, you need to place some files from sekiro folder for it to work.
Also all soulsgames (except demons souls) should work including bloodborne, only tested on sekiro and ds1 though.

Thanks for your working. May I ask for a tool which can restore smd files to flver files? I want to use it to modify the model in Sekiro for playable mods.

Thanks! If it works, so that models from other games can be transferred to Sekiro?

I need some help.

so, the DX10 textures. is there a way to get these into a more usable format (like the .dds Format that the texture tool also exports as) directly though the texture Tool, or do I have to convert it manually? if manually, then how.

Read "README" for usage, you need to place some files from sekiro folder for it to work.
Also all soulsgames (except demons souls) should work including bloodborne, only tested on sekiro and ds1 though.

I tried the instrument with sekiro but there are still problems with the skeleton with many models. I would advise to check them all because some others do not and say which ones are useless since this happened to everyone. I would like to pay attention to another issue. while I was watching, I found something interesting in the big carp



we can see that there are some bones that are not connected with the rest of the choice in the fin area. I believe that they are not connected not only to the question of the skeleton's error, but because those bones are related to the physical part of the moello that is the hair cloaks etc that are not used to animate

I unpack all with mimic tools (yabber), but still no see mtd folder.
And you say I must unpack them all again with other program? How many unpackers I must use for getting one model?

That meant "unpack them all against" XD
So, I do and get mtd and use your tools, but with the divine dragon, this gives lost weight and parentship with more bones.

Hey, its this idiot again.

so, I am missing textures.  when trying to extract c2630 (the huntsman enemy), but when running the .chrbnd file through the binder tool it doesnt output a .tpf

the chr directory does have c2360_2.tpf, but this lacks certain textures (notably the bandage texture.)

it does output a blank txt file called div_data.

Hello, dude!
In Sekiro almost all chr models are placed not in one folder with textures. You must unpack all you see in chr folder and then search "chr". Copy all and paste somewhere else - it gives you all characters and textures in their numbers folder.
I do that always with Sekiro and Ds3

Dragon that I get have textures placed in 3 numbered archives

Hey, guys!

I get the problem with Bloodborne DLC weapons - all of them no have textures (i mean, TPF archive or somethink no place here)
I use different unpackers, but still no have them.
And I can't try to unpack from disk files because I no have original game files, only unpacked parts

May be someone just send me DLC weapons textures? I glad to get especially Circular saw textures

Hello.

I am currently making a custom map in Call Of Duty Black Ops III that is Bloodborne-themed zombies map. However, I don't have any reliable means of obtaining map textures/models, props (fences, lampposts, stairs, stones, etc.), or character models. Can someone please PM me the game files so that I can start working on my map? Any help would be MUCH appreciated. Thanks.

A simple Google search will give you tons of links to choose from to get the files, torrents included.

Okay, so I've acquired the game files. Is there a way to batch convert a bunch of files at one time to save me some time with porting? Clicking and dragging one at a time for hours on end is very tedious. I need as many props and textures as I can get.

Yabber can extract multiple files at once.

It works but then you have to convert the dds files with :

Hey Guys, having difficulty using these tools with Sekiro. The tools aren't doing anything. I extracted the files correctly, and dragged and dropped the flver and tpf files onto the model and texture tools, respectively. A window came up for a moment, then went away, and nothing happened. No textures or XPS files appeared. 

What's going on with the tool? Does it still work with Sekiro?

When I try to convert large buildings from Dark Souls 3, like the Lothric walls for example, the larger surfaces have broken UVs which cannot be properly textured.

Is this a problem with the converter, or are the models just like that for some reason?

Hey, I've been trying to use this but when I load the .SMD in Blender the model is all scrunched up. I'm planning on porting and rigging all character models and maps later on from DS1re, DS2 sotfs, DS3, and maybe Demon Souls. I've been looking around for a few days now and haven't been able to find a solution.

Hey guys. Does anyone know the lamp model ID? (The one you light, like the bonfire in dark souls)

Also, the messengers (c9020) don't have any textures? Only the accessories?

Also where does one get the textures for environments?

For instance in the m21 folder there are .tpf files, but they're only like 200kb. But there are also .tpfbdt files which are 60-100mb. How do I extract those? Or do I not need them? Where are the texures then for the environment models?

Hey, I seem to be having problems with extracting the textures, I'm dragging the tpf files onto the extractor but it doesn't produce any output.
the models are extracting just fine

Are you sure you're using Bloodborne_texture.exe for that? Also if you want to extract level textures, the .tpfbdt/.tpfbhd files, you need to decrypt them first with the BinderTool.

it just extracts meshes. No placing at the original position

Hey daemon1. Is it possible to support this, to unpack whole maps with objects in the correct position? DSMapStudio opens them correctly, but there's no way to extract. :/ It requires all files from the map folder you open, I suspect the positions are stored elsewhere for the objects.

Sure its possible, but i dont have time for this. Especially when some other people already did this, and its all opensource on github as i can see.

Hello! I'm trying to open a similar file format from one of FromSoft's other game, Kido Senshi Gundam Unicorn.
The game's BND files has a BND4 Header which should be the same as Bloodbornes(?) as Yabber is able to extract them.

Now, the game's flver files I'm not so sure as I found an old 3dsmax script that was able to load the flver but it only read a skeleton data, no mesh.
I tried daemon1's executable but the command prompt only opens and stays without anything happening.
I wonder what's the problem..

here's a file sample
[https://www.mediafire.com/file/jrl5nfbe ... 00.7z/file](https://www.mediafire.com/file/jrl5nfbexsiatx7/c00_000_00.7z/file)

Cheers

Use Bindertool again. It will extract it into a folder called o222000. Just go inside all the way down, and use the tools daemon provided.

Why I can't get textures using the texture.exe file?
I drag any .tpf file to the texture.exe, the program initially start, then close, but nothing appears in the directory after that.
The model program for .flver works and the converted file successfully appears, but the texture program no.
I also modified the compatibility settings for let him run as administrator when I drag a .tpf file into it, but still doesn't work.
Any explaination/ideas of possible problem? (The texture are of Dark Souls 3's models)

Yo everyone. I wanted take some models from BB, likes lagre buildings and ect. I got files, got models, got textures of map models (.dds and .dx10). I changed the .smd and .ascii textures to the right format (.tif 2 .dds) and changed the path (u know, in .smd and .ascii u have a material name and after / - some path. Example: Material__6\N:\SPRJ\data\Model\map\m21\tex\m21_00_ground_052_a.tif). I changed the path for bypass Blender`s characters limit. If I search the texture with path I wrote in .smd or .ascii - I`ll find it. Anyway, auto-texturing does not working, perhaps I`m stupid, but I NEED A HELP.

There's a modded UXM by Meowmaritus in this discord : [https://discord.gg/3bpAdDuDsk](https://discord.gg/3bpAdDuDsk)

Or this tool by Ekey : [https://github.com/Ekey/ER.BDT.Tool](https://github.com/Ekey/ER.BDT.Tool)

Then the updated tool by Daemon works for models, but it seems textures for them are not unpacked yet.

I only find envmap tpf for map models, did I miss something to unpack or is this it ?
You have missed something, there are .flver map models.

From mapbnd I got flver then smd, that works fine for models.
From tpfbnd I got tpf then dds, that works but I only have envmap textures. 
Is this supposed to contain model textures, are the necessary tpf compressed in another directory, or am I simply missing them.

Assuming that you have extracted the game files without error, then will be in another directory.

With previous games there were tpfbdt for each map, now it seems different. Did you manage to get textured models ?

Yes, no issues.
If you cannot do it then wait for my rip to be done and uploaded.
I cannot post the link here due to forumn rules, but you can find my archive by googling my username.

I got it to work on Bloodborne, Dark Souls 3 and Sekiro, but the structure seems different for Elden Ring, I can't find those packed tpf for map models textures. 

I was talking about environments textures, I'm only getting some "envmap" and I don't think that's it.

I guess I'll wait for some progress then.

A quick fix for the tool to work with Elden Ring models

Thanks for your awesome tool!
I managed to extract melina already but also found some problems of it  

The model is somehow flipped like this and I think they are supposed to be flipped along Y axis


And some of her hair UVs are messed up but some of them work normally



And here are some samples which contains the original file of melina. Much appreciated if you are willing to take a look at it!

I'm also noticing that the sleeve also has the wrong UV all together. There might be others but so far this is the only thing i've found so far that has a wrong uv. As for the hair UVs, there should be more than one UV channel. I noticed this on the fur coat as well. UV 3 was using the common pc hair texture for the fur alpha

OH, how did you manage to import the extracted model into blender? Every time I try to import the .ascii mesh file it always warns me something like "Traceback...". I have no choice but to convert the ascii model in Noesis to another format like .gltf etc.

Maybe that's why I can't find the UV3 layer of her hair, for there are only up to 2 UVs of her hair found after being converted

I modified the ascii script to skip textures. It was erroring on a null reference. The third UV is just the shadow uv for her hair. In your case, you are just using the wrong hair texture. I'm using AAT500_PCHair_n in this image. I know the color isnt exactly right but it's more proof of concept . Not sure if i used the same character package as you though.

Wow, your looks livelike than mine.I guess I used the other model package that diffrent from yours but I find it in "c2180.chrbnd".
But I'm quite curious about your textures name "AAT500_PCHair_n", I found no texture named like this from melina's texture .tpf file.(For the textures I got are all named like "c2180_Face_a", "c2180_Body_n" etc.) Does this texture store in another package may I ask? Or did you use another way to extract the "Data3.bhd" package which made your extracted file names diverse from which I got?Σ( ° △ °|||)
Even though I got the lifelike melina, there are still only 2 UV channels when I preview it in Noesis.




BTW, I'm still googling how to skip the texture by editing the XNALara addon but got no clue of it. I try to use Notepad++ to edit the "material_creator.py" to render all the "True" commands to be "False" (I know this way is wrong and kinda stupid  ). Appearantly, it doesn't work for me haha...

I probably should have been more specific. "AAT500_PCHair_n" Is in the common_body.tpf inside the parts folder. As for the python script, i modified the loadImage() function to treat it as new image always instead of trying to load an image. I used C2180 as well so it seems we used the same character file.

OHHHH! Thanks a lot, finally made it.  
Though I still don't know how to modify the blender addon script but I used another tool made by kotn3l, which makes loading the .ascii successfully. → [viewtopic.php?t=24883&p=180779#p180779](https://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?t=24883&p=180779#p180779)

I'm not sure whether the sleeve UV problem you mentioned can be dealt with by using another stitch textures named "AAT300_Stitch_01_a" in the "common_body.tpf" package.
Here's what I got:

What do you use for unpacking ER data.bdt archives?


There's a modded UXM by Meowmaritus in this discord : https://discord.gg/3bpAdDuDsk

Or this tool by Ekey : https://github.com/Ekey/ER.BDT.Tool

Then the updated tool by Daemon works for models, but it seems textures for them are not unpacked yet.

UXM say me that it can be used for only Dark souls files, not for ER/ New version I can't dl from discord, because discord have no working now (gry page)
And how to use Ekey tools?

Great way, to say about model extraction with tools, that not published yet 
(sorry for my english)
I try to use ER tools, but only one I have is nothing

UPD: nevermind, I found a way. Now need check UV
UPD2: UV for fur and feathers has broken. Any chance to fix without spend life for re-UV?

See how i quoted the message with out making a mess as you did while quoting the whole thing? it takes space and its just bad, can you edit it?
Everyone needs to learn to do that appropriately.

For your question though, select your entire model click A, assuming that's the ONLY thing in your scene, just do Ctrl+M for mirroring, then you select your axis, in this case for character i assume its Y, then hit enter.
But i think, if the model does not require mirroring, the texture needs to be flipped only. If model too then the mirror of whole model is fine.

I need a little help with Malekith's model. All of the fur/hair meshes seem to have weird UVs (not broken, I don't think) and none of the textures inside his respective .tpf nor in the common_body.tpf files work properly. One texture vaguely seems to work with the main hair, but there's nothing with any kind of alpha map so there's not much of a point for it. Anyone know if I could find these textures somewhere?

This is what I often said in other topics. Particle mesh was often used in these ER models. It's not wrong, it's a way to create hair or fur. The problem is that except for those particle meshes, there is a meshes (Especially fur and hair) with a bad UV. In the case of these meshes, you have to rearrange and modify each UV one by one... It's a very inefficient way, but that's the only way to fix it. Therefore, I think daemon tool needs to be newly patched. The UV of some meshes needs to be clearly modified.

That's quite unfortunate. Well, I'll wait as long as I need, just the thought of using these models properly in the future sounds so cool. Thank you for the info

No, the tool doesnt need to be modified, it works fine, and all UVs are correct.

I think daemon tool needs to be newly patched. The UV of some meshes needs to be clearly modified.

No, the tool doesnt need to be modified, it works fine, and all UVs are correct.

Yes. I also confirmed it. When I use your tool, ascii and smd formats are created. However, in the smd format, only one UV is applied. That's why we need a tool to convert ascii with all UV channels so that they can be used on a blender or 3d max. With noesis, we could extract up to two UV channels. I think what we need now is a noesis py script that can extract all the UV channels along with the mesh.

I've seen at least 2 different noesis scripts that can handle 4 UV channels from ascii, or maybe more if they will be present.

Could you please provide links to that tools? I also spent a really long time trying to find noesis scripts for this, but I couldn't find it. What I found was that we can extract up to two uv channel with 'fmt_nxps_0_9_6' script. If there is a published script, could you let us know it?

So, I hear about it, but never find this plugin.
Also - how to use more that 1 UV channels? My 3ds max is old and can't work with multiply UV channels (or Idk where it placed)

For your question though, select your entire model click A, assuming that's the ONLY thing in your scene, just do Ctrl+M for mirroring, then you select your axis, in this case for character i assume its Y, then hit enter.
But i think, if the model does not require mirroring, the texture needs to be flipped only. If model too then the mirror of whole model is fine.

Hey, sorry it's me again! I tried this method you've written, but after importing the flipped model as FBX to Unreal Engine I have a problem. The mesh looks as it should, but the moment I move let's say the right arm, it immediately pops back to its original, left position, as if the skeleton wasn't flipped. This happens to every bone I move that is not in the centre of the model. Did I miss a step in Blender? Or what did I do wrong?

Thank you in advance for your help!

You answered yourself then, the skeleton needs to be as well, usually you can fix that by importing the character from left-handed to right-handed system and vice versa, theoretically should be able to be performed in Blender internally, unfortunately i am not experienced in Blender, maybe someone more experienced in this will answer.

Did you check the shoulder bones of this model? I also checked this model, but the vertex weight of the shoulder has been reversed... Fortunately, the complete model has already been ported from this gallery. If there is a problem with the shoulder bone, I think it would be better to convert this model.

Oh, interesting. Yeah The shoulders do seem to be flipped, but that's a simple fix really, so I'm not too concerned. Thank you for the link though! I'll have to check out their other uploads sometime

Nah.... What I'm saying is not simply that the bones are flipped. Whole body's shoulder vertex weight has been flipped. It's a completely different meaning from a partial bone flipped. Anyway, I hope you get the results you want.

Ah, so cool!
But how to use many UV maps? I mean, before that I just export to FBX then to XNAlara/mmb/blender/etc
But how I must choose one of UV for exporting?

In Soulsgames human-NPC/main hero doesn't have self folders. You can only get the body parts (without clothes), basic headparts (hair, lashes, eyes, basic face, etc) and weapons-armours. All faces of human NPC and main hero saved as morph file (.tri) and facegen file.

Basic body ans faces placed in PARTS folder. Check archives like FC_m_0000 (male basic body)

I try, but no luck in all soulsgames. Or Idk right way to convert it.

Also you can use ninjaripper to get NPC and main hero faces. But it have alot problems: bad UVs, no rig, deformations, more fragmented meshes and no working fine with open locations (best inside rooms). I get my hero face from ds3 with that, but was so tired and no back to use ninja after that.

Maybe ninjaripper 2.0.9 will support extracting games models that use dx12, but it is still W.I.P..

Make sure to use the ascii mesh since they have more UVs. Generally the second UV is used for alpha materials.

When I open generated ascii file into other programs (3ds max) using xnalara import it don't load bones weight.
When I try open generated ascii file in Noesis, it no load any models.
If I open this files in XNAlara or 3dcloak, it can't be open.

What I do wrong?

EDIT: Oookay, I get bones working, but fur still looks bad

So after some looking around here, I managed to find a workflow for exporting Sekiro models with the UVs and material names intact (you still need to assign the textures yourselves). Most likely people have figured this out already but I want to write the general process for those that don't know yet.

Make sure you have Blender Source Tools installed in order to import .smd files.

1. UXM unpack Sekiro's files if you haven't already.

2. Use Yabber/BBTools to extract mesh files from your selected chrbnd.dcx, as well as textures from texbnd.dcx.

3. Get Dropoff's FLVER Tool ([viewtopic.php?f=16&t=17332&start=285#p150733](https://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=17332&start=285#p150733)). Copy and paste allmaterialbnd.mtdbnd.dcx and oo2core_6_win64.dll from your Sekiro installation into its file directory. 

4. Drop the .flver file on the .exe to generate a importable .smd file format.

5. Import the .smd into Blender. You will see one combined mesh at first.

6. Mesh -> Separate by Material.

7. In Sekiro's case, correct the UV orientation by selecting all meshes and in the UV Editing tab, Mirror Y. 

8. Reverse normals, Export as OBJ or whatever format you wish.

All new model and texture tools. I'll save 1st version at 1st post in case of problems with new one.



Whats new:

1. fixed some models crashing (because of japanese names. non-standard chars replaced with "_")
2. map assets support
3. textures applied automatically!
- SMD will have material name and after "/" - only name of first texture which is usually diffuse
- ASCII will have mesh number, material name, and all textures, be that 4 or 14 of them
important note: ASCII and SMD files will have texture names as .TIF and .TGA, so you have to either convert textures to these formats, or do text mass replace .TIF to .DDS in ASCII/SMD because they are text files.
4. texture tool will now export DX10 textures with .DX10 extension, so their names will be original, for auto-texturing to work.
hey guys! is that possible to export the whole map with textures from ds3 to blender or 3dsmax ? its kinda hard to export objects 1 by 1 and position them by hands..

Yes, you can use DStools for Unity and export to .fbx from there : [https://github.com/katalash/dstools](https://github.com/katalash/dstools)

I've been working on extracting Sekiro models with this tool, UMX, and Yabber, but I am having a hard time getting the model testures into a usuable format (i.e. png, jpg, etc.)

Anyone know how to properly extract the Sekiro textures cause I'm at a lose.

Also is there a list of which Sekiro DCX models of what they are? I've been trying to find the Kusabimaru and Mortal Blade but it's so tedious going through all the models one at a time to try and find them since everything is just has numbers for file names.

if any1 experiencing some problems with installing, you must know that the unity version must be 2018.3.6 not 2019.1.0.
2018.3.6 version has all of the presets and this is the only version which works for me

does any1 know how to render this with textures  like in game?

So Unity doesn't distribute this version anymore apparently, good if you've got a previous one working.

Step 12 stipulates :

> Note for DS3 if you want map textures, you have to import all the TPFBHD files with Import TPFBHD for the map you want to load BEFORE importing the map. these are located in the map/mXX directory (where mXX is your target map) in your game's root directory. You need to import all 4 files.

For the love of God, the moment you type that on Google, tons of websites show up that host the files, this is NOT a forum to share game assets.

This forum is about reverse engineering of game formats you have on your HDD, tools that are shared about those reversed formats, not sharing game assets like a warez website, i get it some do it in private, but this is a big no no in here, check the rules yourself.

hi guys，As for DsTools, I have got the texture files, but they are not automatically assigned to the model. I guess it's because unity can't parse dds files. Can someone tell me what to do?

hello I'm a bit clueless here but how do I extract maps like say, a boss room from Elden Ring? Also I encountered a problem where the texture.exe failed to extract the texture from the .tpf file as in a cmd prompt would pop out and then closes but no texture whatsoever

Edit: Use DS Map Studio!

actually i need some of bloodborne models and textures for a project and i could not dump the game by my ps4(because of firmware) so i downloaded a dump in one of the safe websites .
and i knew that i needed to make a fpkg but i did not have the app folder that contains sce_sys and sce_moudle folders to make my fpkg to make gp4 file(i tried actually all of the tools possible such as ps4 pkg viewer or ps4 pkg maker) !
can someone help me to create the folder without ps4 OR share the bloodborne app folder that i can make gp4 file(i guess it must be around 10_60 mb) ?

What's so difficult to understand for so many newbies that this isn't a place to beg for files? I saw very quickly that while the tools and help are available, when there are existing methods available you are expected to 'earn' the assets by doing the work yourself, if you're not willing to then you must not really want them. Tools if not here are usually found with a google. Hell, the files themselves can usually be found with a google for a popular game like this, just not here.
