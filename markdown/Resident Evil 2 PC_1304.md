Just go to Work in Progress and select the game.

The bins are all like I put on the WIKI. The ADT are not archives in my opinion. What they are, I don't know.

I've noticed that *.ADT and *.BIN are not the exact file types, game CD contain different file groups under *.BIN and *.ADT extensions   ...

The die and do2 files appear to be 256 palletted graphics. They are not archives and will need a conversion to map the pallette to indexed BMP but the ADT do seem to be archived somehow.

It is necessary to suffer really my friend... Analysis of archives do about free time from affairs so it is necessary to wait

Hello,

a ADT file is a compressed image (bitstream, with Huffman and RLE-like stuff for compression). The decompressed stream is either a TIM image, or a 320x240 16 bits RAW image in 2 blocks.

More infos on some pages I just wrote:
[http://rewiki.regengedanken.de/wiki/.AD ... il_2_PC%29](http://rewiki.regengedanken.de/wiki/.ADT_%28Resident_Evil_2_PC%29)
and here for Xentax wiki (for reference):
