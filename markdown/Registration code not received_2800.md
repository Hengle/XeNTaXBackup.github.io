Hi,

I am new here. I joined this community mainly because I want to learn various file format and some techniques for extracting these files. 

Anyway, I sent my donation awhile back via paypal but haven't receive any email containing the registration code. Not sure if there is something did wrong in the process but hope I can get some help here...

Best Regards,
simple

Hi,

I have also sent a donation recently to register@xentax.com but have not received a download link or code.

Thanks
