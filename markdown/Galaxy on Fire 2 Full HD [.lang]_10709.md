Although the lang files can be opened with Notepad++ and edited and the game still runs fine, instead of every text in-game, I get "Error language". So I think the case is not that easy. Does anyone have some thoughts on this? Thank you.

Were there texts before you modified that file?

Oops, I think I uploaded a corrupt file. I've updated the file in the first link. Yes, there were texts, before I modified the file.

OK, I wanted to be sure, because this game is known about bad OS language detection.
So I made tests on my own, and also got Error language. But if I wrote text in UTF8 encoding and recalculate string length, texts are fine.

I learn it from forums, and other peoples codes.
