If you are talking about the final version of the game, it's actually just bink video files renamed to .int (probably because they changed last minute and hence didn't wanna change the code).

The demo/prototype versions of the game do seem to have "real" .int files though.

Except the PS2 version doesn't use Bink video at all. But some sort of custom MPEG-2 container made by Ubisoft Montreal.
