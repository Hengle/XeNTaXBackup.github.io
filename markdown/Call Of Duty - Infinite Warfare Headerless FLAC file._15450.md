Wait is this for Modern Warfare or Infinite Warfare? If IW how were you able to access the SABL file?

I just made an interesting observation in this thread [viewtopic.php?f=10&t=15447&p=124007#p124007](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=15447&p=124007#p124007) about the sample he posted. 

You think Infinite Warfare is the same thing?

EDIT: nope it is not the same thing nevermind.
