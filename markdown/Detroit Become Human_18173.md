Opening this thread to see if someone is interested in this game's models.
Anyone planning on creating a tool for this game whenever the files get dumped?

Here is the question - how can one dump a PS4 game?

Since 4.5 update you can store your games on an external HDD, but... it can't be that easy, can it?

I'm afraid that the HDD option is not working for me.

To use my external HDD on the PS4, first I have to format it. This process doesn't just erase its content, it also prepares that harddrive to can be use as a PS4 device.

Once installed, I can move the games from the PS4 system on to the HDD (Detroit that has 43 gb, could be moved to my HDD leaving just some 200 mb in the harddrive, good).

But then, when I plug that external drive in my computer, it doesn't detect it. (No drive letter or way to enter there), I went to the Create and format menu of window 10, there I initialized the HDD and gave it a letter (E) (After this step, the HDD won't work on PS4 anymore unless it were formated again). so after initialize the HDD, it appears now in MyPc folder, but I can't enter there, when I enter I see an empty folder and an menu asking me to format the drive to can read the files that are inside.


My thoughts are that the HDD was formated in the PS4 and changed into a different data structure than the one that uses windows. so the PS4 files that are in the HDD, are "compresed" in some way that my PC doesn't know how to interpret.

Am I missing any step?

Well, as I can't read the PS4 game copied in my external HDD, I'm going to try this other idea explained here: [http://pixelvulture.com/2015/11/download-ps4-games/](http://pixelvulture.com/2015/11/download-ps4-games/)

Hey guys, you need to stop torturing yourselves, it does NOT work that way.

First you need an exploited PS4, hacked that is, then you will be able to install the games in debug settings that are available up to that firmware, to this day only up to firmware 5.05, beyond that firmware games will not work and Detroit Become Human is one of them, you will find any information you need in same place where you get PS4 dumped games.

Why do you want to put the game on an external HDD. I have the disc copy with an blu ray drive on my PC. I'm in the process of copying the files from the disc to my PC. Much easier than trying to get it off your PS4.

Is that really an actual working method to be able to extract all of the game's data and thus have access to the models? It sounds too easy to me, considering how much time some games took to be able to rip. If this method worked, I'm guessing every game would get ripped in a matter of days.

This can be done for a few years now, nothing new, it will only copy the original huge PKG archive to your PC, where it will just sit there wasting space, ONLY an exploited/hacked PS4 can gain access inside its contents by installing the game in the PS4s HDD, then you gain access to the files after they have been extracted and installed.

Game PKGs inside any Blu-ray disc are encrypted and ONLY a PS4 can decrypt them, based on its firmware it was released.

How about PShack programm? It can decrypt any archives (not sure about the name, can't get reply from my friend who know about it)

I'm very interested with Connor and basic androids and gynoids models for VRchat 
But no have PS4 and the game...

You can hack the PKG with it.
If you do it right, you can succeed.

Sure you can decrypt any archives if you have the key
Problem is, we will probably never have that key.
Almost all of the PS4 games decrypted before were decrypted with different method, because there is no way to get the actual key.

I really hope one day we can get models out of the game. Wouldnt it be easier to rip from the demo though?

The problem isn't ripping the models out of the files, it's getting the files. There is no public exploit for the firmware that Detroit needs and without that you can't decrypt the pkgs, it's the same situation for the demo.

The bad news is that the game has not leaked yet.
These are just fan-made models. but the models still look great.

Does anyone have progress with that?
Or we must wait for new fanmodels like this?

nobody can have any progress until game files will be accessible
and this will not happen any soon, same as for all new PS4 games
