- Post Title: Crypt of the Necrodancer [PS Vita]

Alright, I'm trying to get audio files from the japanese PS Vita version of Crypt of the Necrodancer. I've run into the problem, that, after 3 evenings of research on various websites (including many chinese and japanese ones), appearantly there is no dump of the japanese edition, only of the us version. In the process I've come across the .pkg file of the game. I've used st4rk's PkgDecrypt on it, and it clearly shows that the files I want are contained in the pkg, but almost all the files are gibberish, I assume they are still encrypted in some way (probably the pfs encryption I've read about?). Now, I don't own a vita myself, so there is no way for me to dump the game myself. My question is, can anything be done with the files that were produced by PkgDecrypt? Or is my last possibility to ask around if someone would be so nice as to dump the game files for me?

Update: after doing more research, I can definitely say that the files are pfs encrypted. Concluding from what I've found and read, there's no way to decrypt pfs encrypted files atm because the encryption method is still unknown. The only way to circumvent the issue is to dump the game directly from the PS Vita itself. Can anyone here confirm whether or not that's true?
