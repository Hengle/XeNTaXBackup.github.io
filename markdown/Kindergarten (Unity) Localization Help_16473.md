- Post Title: Kindergarten (Unity) Localization Help

Hey everybody. I wanted to make a localization for kindergarten. But I don't know how to remove the character limit. Also I changed the font but I can't use it at the main menu. It works just fine anywhere else but at the main menu.










I am using UnityText for the Level files and UnityEX for the .asset files. Thanks in advance.
