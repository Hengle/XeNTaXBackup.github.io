The files, inside the pak, are compressed with zlib.

Hello.
Can someone take a look inside the .pak file, which contains music? Can it be ripped nowadays?

Yeah, you can use this script [http://aluigi.org/bms/the_club.bms](http://aluigi.org/bms/the_club.bms)
with quickbms [https://aluigi.altervista.org/quickbms.htm](https://aluigi.altervista.org/quickbms.htm)
to unpack data.

Then you can load BAF files in foobar to play them

There is also BAF extractor here [viewtopic.php?p=79101#p79101](https://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?p=79101#p79101)

ikskoks, thank you very much for your help!

I used BAF extractor and got separate .wavel containers/files, but they are not playable in WinAmp.
Example - [https://www51.zippyshare.com/v/70DzQmsC/file.html](https://www51.zippyshare.com/v/70DzQmsC/file.html)

I made a search on forum, but I did not find any information about this type of files.
Is there a way to extract ordinary .wav's (?) from them?

Yes, you can load BAF file in foobar (with vgmstream plugin)
and convert audio to WAV
