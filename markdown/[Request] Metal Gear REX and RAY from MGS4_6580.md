- Post Title: [Request] Metal Gear REX and RAY from MGS4

Hello, I'm looking for the models for Metal Gears REX and RAY from Metal Gear Solid 4.  I wanted to try to figure out how to get them myself from the stage.dat files (definitely in stage04.dat), but I can't even figure out the encryption format.  Honestly, I should've just asked first, since these two models are all I want from MGS4.  Can someone help me?
