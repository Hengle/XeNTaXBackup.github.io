Still no one has written a code or made a tool to repack the POD5 files? I tried the blood rayne packer but those create POD3 which is similar but when I replaced a texture and tried to repack and launch the game it was a no go. Also if anyone knows anything about converting the xbox360 TEX and BFM files that would be great, and no, ghostbusters TEX converter doesn't work on the 360 TEX files.
