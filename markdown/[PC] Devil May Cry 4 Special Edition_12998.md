DMC4 SE uses an updated version of MT Framework so many formats are different. Tools compatible with Revelations 2 should work with DMC4 SE as well.

I updated my arctool to better support DMC4 SE:

I don't think there's currently a tool for converting model files in DMC 4 SE though.

Could the Revelations/RE6 model importers work with this version of the framework?

I tried using the RE .mod importers for 3ds max, they correctly import the models, but most of the times, the UV maps are messed up.

Some models? Do UV import correctly on other models? I'm curious, does Nero (new outfit) import wrong? That's the only one I'm currently interested in...

The problem is that some objects, even in the same file, have working UV maps, some other don't!
I tried with Nero, for example I remember that the coat and the hair don't have UVs.

And the skin weights aren't importet at all.

Uhm I see... so I guess we need to wait for a better importer.

Yeah I'm aware of that... but I don't really know how to contact the guy (deronar) since his account is deactivated at the moment.
