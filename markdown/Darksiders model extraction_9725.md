- Post Title: Darksiders model extraction

This is really silly, I know, but I can't get past the .oppc zip files that contain the models for Darksiders. Can someone tell me how to extract them? I have Noesis with the Darksiders script installed. I heard someone made a script to extract them, but I tried it, and it turns out it is a command prompt program... yeah. I have absolutely no luck with GUI-less programs, as I can never get them to work, and the creators never tell you the exact command you are supposed to use to actually use the program. Could someone help me out? All I need to do is get to the model files, then I should be good. If the program I need is without a GUI, could someone explain in detail what I need to do to make it work? 
I installed Steam to the standard location for a 32-bit OS (I have Windows 7), if that helps. 
Thanks!

Really? Not one single reply, when tons of other requests have been filled since I posted this? I know this has been done at some point, all I need is a quick answer, so I can get started.

Should learn how command-line works. Like, starting with how to open cmd.

I know how to open command prompt, I'm no noob. I can do stuff with computers that most people would have no clue about- but I usually don't come across command line programs like these in my daily travels. Especially ones that lack proper instructions. Can anyone help me, or should I just give it up and say that despite there being working tools for Darksiders 2 model extraction, Darksiders 1 was completely overlooked?

It could be I have the wrong tool, because I just got it to work, but it gave me an error, referring to the mnfst file, meaning this extractor only works with Darksiders 2... I thought the Darksiders 2 DS2Extract tool would work with Darksiders 1 files, but I was wrong... Is there a tool for Darksiders 1?
