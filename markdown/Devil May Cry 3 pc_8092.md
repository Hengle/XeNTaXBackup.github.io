hello everyone, well I need to open a bin file
I think it is a esenario, I want to do is to cut the game and just put the parts where Dante and Vergil fight for that right I have to leave the textures of Dante and Vergil, the movements and esenarios but I do not know how to differentiate
the extensions that have the gdata.pak (. afs)
when I start out:
extensions. phd bin pac ptx tm2 tsb ptz bd mod
I know pac and tm2 open but the others do not
I just want to finally leave esenarios weapons and all movements proved necessary, I just want the game to cut the parts that do not want
well I do not know much English but I hope you are understanding me
