- Post Title: Mobile Suit Gundam: Encounters in Space archive files.

Hi, I'm trying to figure out how to extract the .mb archive files from this game. I don't know anything at all about scripting, coding, or programming, but I found this topic [viewtopic.php?f=10&t=6251](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=6251)
When I try using the script from that topic, most of the archive files lead to an error on line 17. I can only really fully extract one. I just want to get at the audio files.

Any help would be appreciated.

Sorry to necro, but would anyone know how to do this with QuickBMS? I see .MB files but there seems to also be a LCK where the MB files are located, which may be hiding them. Any help would be wonderful.
