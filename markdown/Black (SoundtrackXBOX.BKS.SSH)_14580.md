Hi everyone, I really want to extract the soundtrack of "BLACK" from the Xbox version. 
These tracks are present in different locations like "level" and "sound" folders. 
The format is .bks and .ssh (some of them are without .ssh).
Below will be attached a link to a sample file.

First of all, who posts a link like this:
mega:///#F!elVB1BzS!DCTH7OlAh4ygbDbtp-WMJA

On MEGA, there should be a function where you're able to get the full link. So stop assuming we're on google chrome already and repost it.

Well I'm extremely sorry too for scolding you. I was a bit too enthusiastic/annoyed about that.
Anyway, those files are something I've never seen before but since I'm mostly busy slacking off I can look at it later.
