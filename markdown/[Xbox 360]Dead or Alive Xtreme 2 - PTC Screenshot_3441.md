Hey there

Im working right now on a little tool to extract screenshots out of CONÂ´s.
I allready added some games ( which was really easy ) but now I got this format here.

The Magic says "PTC+MSHM".
I allready searched for it and found out that it is a modificated TIFF format.

Im not that good with researching graphic formats ... well, I never tried ^^
Hopefully someone can help me.

PS.: Well, if someone can figure it out, dont say anything about the actual screenshot ... ... ...
