Months ago, i made a mmd for tiara. Now ADF has come, i noticed that tiara has a new clothes, although it is properly a new texture, not a new model. But i wanna get it.
The old one i get is from deviantart, in order to get the new one, i has searched on google.
Here i noticed [https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/ ... iry+fencer](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=542689273&searchtext=fairy+fencer) , but it is different from the new one, it didnt work.

Finally i go here for help, can anyone help me?

add ".dds" extension to your sample and open with native Noesis DX10 support

Random Talking Bush has done extensive work for games from these devs. There is a 3DS Max script for models and a bit lower, under Archive Extraction, is 'Compile Heart - CL3 extractor' which is a quickbms script. Run that on the .cl3 files to get a bunch of .tid files. These can be renamed to .dds and opened in the latest Noesis and then converted to a proper, working texture (I guess it's missing headers or something when you simply rename it so they won't show on the model).
