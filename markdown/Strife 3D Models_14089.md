- Post Title: Strife 3D Models

This is the game: [http://store.steampowered.com/app/339280/](http://store.steampowered.com/app/339280/)
It is a free to play MOBA.
I kinda liked the models, so guess what I was thinking   

When the game is downloaded you can navigate to the folder C:\Steam\SteamApps\common\strife\game\
The file with all the content is called resources0.s2z and can be extracted simply using winzip   

the textures are dds format   

So far so good, the models are in the (you guessed it ) .model file, all other files seem to be xml

So here is a first go at extracting the cow monk (Bo)
Original Artwork


My extraction, for now. only verts and tris at this point

Another update with texture and first import script into max soon

found name of the meshes and texture coordinates
also figured out that the animations are stored into seperate .clip files
animations are stored in a model.mdl 
the rest of the data is stored in a file called hero.entity ( each hero has this set of files )

Some wip:

Sorry man, I was waiting for the game to download so I could test the tools out but... thanks for this and all the wonderful tools you've shared with the community, game companies should be paying you for getting us interested in their free-to-play games and buying the rest, not just for playing but for model viewing.

(As kinda compensation I thanked you now although I didn't care for those models so far.)

And yeah, a thanks rate of 1 of 50 is poor. But that's life.

Even worse: we authors can call ourselves lucky if the users don't complain about what we've created.

None of it is compiled, all the scripts in the attachment are readable python source.
