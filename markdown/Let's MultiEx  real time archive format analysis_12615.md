agreed

it was interesting learning how you work with binary files. working with hex workshop for anything more complicated must be annoying! i use another hex editor which is a bit more visual (010 editor) - but you end up writing scripts in 2 different languages if you want it in mexscript!

It's just a matter of what you're used to, I guess. I like both editors, but have been using HW for ages.  This particular format was not that difficult, but even with the more difficult ones it is good to just look at the hex data, as you teach yourself to recognize patterns. 

Check also [viewtopic.php?t=664](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?t=664) from the past, the Painkiller filename encryption method.

New post: Divinity: Original Sin .PAK files. 

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PtFoTKcvSE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PtFoTKcvSE)&

Now, I know that this forum obviously has more answers to the games I post video's about, but I never looked into those, and the purpose of the videos is the real-time analysis process.   

As for this .PAK format, I know there's more to it than in the video. Perhaps I'll do a part 2 someday.

Of course, that's the whole point of MexScript and MultiEx when I created it back in 1997   . Check this old list of supported formats in MultiEx Commander: 
[http://multiex.xentax.com/suplis.txt](http://multiex.xentax.com/suplis.txt)

Read the manual here:
[http://www.xentax.com/downloads/multiex ... Manual.pdf](http://www.xentax.com/downloads/multiex/MexComManual.pdf)

Get the program for free here: [http://multiex.xentax.com/](http://multiex.xentax.com/)

You can create a stand-alone mod for a game this way: [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dUN8C8Z3sE](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dUN8C8Z3sE)

Read the Mexscript guide here: [http://wiki.xentax.com/index.php?title=MexScript](http://wiki.xentax.com/index.php?title=MexScript)

The MexScript will help you support new formats in MultiEx Commander. Just check the Let's MultiEx tutorials on how to proceed.
