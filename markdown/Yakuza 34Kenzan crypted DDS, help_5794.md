- Post Title: Yakuza 3/4/Kenzan crypted DDS, help

Well I succeed in opening PAR archives (main Yakuza archive format), but files in it seem to be crypted.

Fortunally fonts in this game are located both in folder and in archive (the same files, but in different locations). In folder they are not encrypted, in the archive they are encrypted. 

So we have an encrypted and non-encrupted example of the same file!

Here is it: [http://www.fileshost.com/download.php?id=FAAD56C31](http://www.fileshost.com/download.php?id=FAAD56C31)

Could you please help with compression?

It's LZSS compression I guess.

These links may help:
