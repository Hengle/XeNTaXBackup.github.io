- Post Title: Bakemonogatari Portable Skeleton Ripping

I wanted to rip Bakemonogatari portable character models and stumbled onto this thread [viewtopic.php?t=10467](https://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?t=10467).
The script proved to be a great help, however it doesn't support bone (.amb) files. In the thread, I found a link to a thread for another game that apparently uses the same model formats ([http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f ... =amo+model](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=14800&hilit=amo+model)) where I found a 3DS max script. Luckily, I'm a 3DS Max user. However, doing Scripting>Run Script and selecting the script did nothing at all. That's about where I'm stuck, right now. If anyone could help me, I'd appreciate it.
