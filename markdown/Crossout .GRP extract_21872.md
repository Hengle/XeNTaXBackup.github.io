- Post Title: Crossout .GRP extract

Hello! I am trying to extract models from the game Crossout. There are many old threads about this game but apparently Crossout has recently changed its method of packing models. I have tried ninja ripper, quickbms, and a few other common unpacking tools. Does anybody know how to unpack the new files?
