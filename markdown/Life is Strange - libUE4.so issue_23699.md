- Post Title: Life is Strange - libUE4.so issue

Hi can someone help me for dump libUE4.so with GameGuardian. for Life is Strange Android (my device is not rooted)

I want to translate the game but when I repack the .pak file It says "failed to open descriptor file" on the screen.

So I searched on the internet. And some people told me to edit  libU4.so file.
