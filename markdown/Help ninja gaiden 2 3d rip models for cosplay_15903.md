- Post Title: Help ninja gaiden 2 3d rip models for cosplay

Hi everyone, i am plan to make a ryu hayabusa cosplay with most details as possible. I have sucessfully get some models, but i am not a 3D computer graphics engineer at all, so i have some questions:
-First of all i am working on the lunar staffs models. They looks pretty stranges, see pictures below: The loads are place to different staff size which are represents by meshs. Do you know why ? Is it for animations when staff is drawing ? or maybe for attacks animations ? I don't know...  
-As you can see, in the game the staff looks really better due to lot of effects and post-processing. Is someone very well-informed could explain me the steps applied on the model ? The goal is to get a better shape of the original model alone. For example, maybe there are smooth algorithms or anti-aliasing apply in the game and if yes, which ones ? Maybe is there greyscale texture depth applied too ?

Regards.
