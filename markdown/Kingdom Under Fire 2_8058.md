i'm getting an error message when i try to open some d3dmesh files with the last loader you posted. 

edit : it seems that the problems occurs only when the folder contains another d3d9mesh file with numbers

Thanks,Chrrox.great job.How about rewriting your script into maxscript?
Also I found a problem of your script.
The Texture channel problem,Switch Red and Blue,then you will get correct color of the texture.
like this

Out of curiosity, did anyone manage to find the armour the elf uses in the trailer? The one with the pretty big neckguard.

I'm just not that interested in the stripperific outfits that the majority of the models I went trough seem to have.

I don't know what's wrong with 4shared. the other parts and some of my stuff are fine... except for these two. :/

However here are new links for download. i divided the whole client in 2 this time.

A quick question, am I doing something wrong here? The meshes are loading fine in Noesis but are not displaying with textures. The .de3d9tex files are in the same folder but the names are just a long mess of numbers as they were extracted. Same happens with .d3d9paradata files, only difference is Noesis shows Textures:1 in the viewport yet still doesn't display it. Haven't used Noesis very much so it could very well be my fail  Here's what's written in the debugger:

Detected file type: Kingdom Under Fire II

I'll support this request, I like this game very much (entire KoF series). I have script for older client with bones+weights support, I'm curious will it work with new model-content? Thanks

This is a package from the latest version of the client. it would be great if someone can look at it and share a tool that can extract modelsand textures from the game

https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fzQFz5 ... sp=sharing

Would it be possible to get a re-upload of the very old (2012) version of the client? The 4share links earlier in the thread are long dead, but with the apparent development hell KUFII has been stuck in for about a decade most of the models I'm interested in should be the same. I've searched all over for an older download with no luck, this thread is has simultaneously been a godsend for my KUFII quest and the painful end, can't quite get anything to work - the new client is compressed& has no tools and the old client can't be found. 

I don't care about new content, just extracting the basic troop models, which seem virtually unchanged over a decade of marketing.

> Hi, the US version of the game has been released this week. so i'm posting a sample pkg file. I really hope someone can look to the package and make and extractor tool for it and for the 3d models insideI don't have the time for making tools - it's simple to get some files using offzip:

It's not really "broken", just some additional procedure should be done. I can't believe those guys haven't changed 3d format since.. well lol since 2011? OMG, this game is a total scam, it has great 3d assets as for my taste, but it failed miserably in Philippines, Malaysia, China, Korea and even in Russian lol. Project is really outdated and not finished in sooo many years, and failed in all markets where it's been. Yet still they trying to "milk" new ppl now in NA and UE, this is amazing xD

Thank you guys for looking at this! 
Zaramot, from what i see, it looks like you achieved to import models in 3ds max (screenshot).
Can you please share your maxscript ?
Thank you

Sorry for the useless post, i'm trying to contain the excitement...
Could i add myself to the voices asking for the script...?   

Edit: Also i supose the animation are loaded with PredatorCZ havok plugin? I saw various files had havok header, but opening with sdk tool gave nothing

Should work! Though, I extracted animations from KUF since 2014 or late 2013 lol Last time I did it, it was in 2017, I guess there was no such great tool from PredatorCZ back then! As I said earlier this game took a long road aha ha ha

All of the old Quickbms scripts work on the newest .pkg files, however it seems the models are further packed into .dat or .vap files that currently can't be extracted, unless I missed something.

It depends how those files looks like, if you could upload them somewhere I'll take a look and edit my scripts/plugin to work with them. It's a good news, that older bms scripts are still working - not a big surprise, since format is basically the same. But I can't check it. because I don't own the game and don't have enough of free space to download it!

I must say - TUN's way of files extraction is almost a valid one, at least it's much better than just using offzip. It's clearly now possible to arrange a proper model importer with some efforts, I have plans to do it - but since I can't spare free time on this task atm, it's just plans for now. So please, if anyone with skills will do it, write down a comment here, so we both wouldn't work on same stuff and wasting time and efforts, I'll better switch to something else then

I know it's probably hopeless but no harm in asking I guess, but did anyone have any luck with models or a script to get them unpacked?

I don't have this game, so I only checked it with the uploaded sample. They were unzipped offzip and I extracted only the part of the havok file.

They contain classes and tags that HavokTool can't handle, probably because they are using a newer version of 2014.
Therefore, many files cannot be opened. I understand the binary of the havok file to some extent, so I tried to extract only the necessary part and use it, but hkxNode seems to be closely related to the animation part, which was impossible.

However, some files can still be read by HavokTool. I have a lot of animations in one file and I can't get the animations properly without understanding the Havok file, but I can.
The essential skeleton hkx file contains hkxNode, so I couldn't open , but another game hkx left on the internet happened to have the same bone structure as KUF, so I used that. You may be able to get both anime and skeletons.

That is awesome! I'm personally more interested in the meshes themselves, I could perhaps try uploading some other files I'm just not sure where the models are kept.

Unfortunately, I have no knowledge of meshes. Also, it only has the ability as a script kiddie.
I'm mainly interested in animation, but because I don't have any knowledge, it only contains new classes and Nodes, and I can't use that file. A more capable person will have access to the mesh and all hkx.

*EDIT
The old client data in this thread is using the 2011 version of havok.
They can be loaded without problems with the currently available havoktool.

If this game hasn't been updated too much since ancient times, it may contain almost everything.
I would like to purchase and check this game on steam next time. The size has increased from 8GB to over 20GB, so I think there will be some updates.

Hi everyone, 

is someone still working on this ? KuF2 servers are going to shut down on Oct 26th, 2021, so this might be the last try to preserve as much of the game as possible...

I hope so. I've been waiting what... almost two years now?   
I do have most of the files on my PC though if it all gets shut downn, at least a build of the game from early 2020.

EDIT: Nevermind, seems like I accidentally deleted all my KuF2 files without realizing it and there's no way for anyone to get the game on steam anymore. Unless someone here already has it installed looks like it's a dead end and we'll never get the models.

I've the "latest" files, but seems like the interest wasn't enough?
I'd gladly upload them but it seems a lil useless to upload them all since there's not enough "development" for an actual extractor/plugin/whatever.

Edit: Here a link with a package with the 1st file of Units and heroes, if someone ever wana give it a chance or w/e

Binary modifications may make skeleton and animation hkx into available formats.
In fact, it has been successful with some files. KUF2 uses havok 2014-2, which needs to be converted for 2014-1.

all the unit files work off of this data.

Vertex

UV
Half Float

Well, with enough work you can get models, just no rigging.

I've manually converted about 40 models so far from elves and dark elves, but it's slow it takes me about 20 minutes per model.

This is awesome! I personally don't have any interest in the rigs, but I'd love to check out the models and textures. What software do you use to extract the models and textures? I'd be happy to do it myself if it's time consuming on your end.

It's a little more complicated than that, but I will try to explain.
the program I'm using is model researcher, the unit files follow the same data example I posted above, you need to enter those in the fields on the left.
this data only works on rigged unit models, weapons have a different float, I think of 16, it also does not work on any mesh with multiple materials, so huge buildings or structures.

I'm only just learning all this myself so I'm not the best person to explain it.

Alrighty then, I'll just patiently wait. I've been lurking on this thread for 2 years already anyway.

Thanks to Mr.Allen, on zenhax, we now have an importer for .vap and .hkx files~

This is awesome news! I downloaded the noesis script, sadly I can't seem to get the .pkg unpacker to work.

Ekey's dumper
https://github.com/Ekey/KUF2.PKG.Tool/releases/tag/0.1

Ekey's dumper is the tool im having a problem with.  I'm probably being blind but I'm not seeing any instructions on how to use it on that forum. I've put the both the .bat and the .exe file in the same location as all the pkg's, I've tried to edit the bat file to manually put in the pkg and unpacking locations, can't seem to get them to work.

You must use cmd KUF2.Unpacker.exe [input file] [output folder] or use a .bat file

I keep getting a "Invalid minor version of PKG file!" error when I run the bat. Does the unpacker only work on a certain version of KuF2? All the files I have were backups from late 2019, I never had a chance to update before they took it off Steam.

Well drat, unless someone can upload all the most recent versions of the pkg files I guess I'm stuck waiting.

Just a heads up Tun, this is not a one click solution, even after getting into the pkg you are given hundreds of unnamed folders and files, you then have to rename and match the skeletons to the models and even I'm struggling with this there are so many, many of the models us the same skeleton and the folder structure i don't understand yet. 
and on top of that all the textures need to be converted with another program called VGMtoolbox (thanks to DJ for showing me that one)
and even after all that they are still unnamed and just all in one folder so there is no way to tell what 1 of the 1478 textures goes to what model

Uhm... i've attached the working bms script which unpack the files and name the .dds already, while other textures files are inside the .vap models so they get extracted/converted with them, thanks to Allen's script.

I'll try to make a "guide" in a few days on how to process the models and everything in a... decent way? Or at least, what worked for me...

This looks like the script Chorrox posted. 
Yeah it is, this script does not work on the pkg files for the steam release, you get a bunch of unnamed vap dds and dat files, no hkx or working skeletons far as I know.

the skeletons in this game are very tricky, they aren't named properly and one skeleton can go to multiple models, with unused bones still attached to it. 

This is the export of that script on unit6.pkg from my prying that is the Elf army units.

This is a better method coming soon just give it time.

I'm using the steam version (they're date 04/2021),the script works and the .hkx files are there, they simply have the .dat extension.
I can post the method i used to get the files "together", i'm fine with the result but... with Ekey's extractor it seems you can easily bypass the annoying search for the models/skeletons -> relative animations. On this side, is there something we can do to help with the game " name library"?

Also the Unit files goes kinda as follow:
Unit1: Troll units
Unit2: Elves- Undead thing - Raptor - A flying monster
Unit3: Orcs - Undead mage - Scorpion - Some kinda character.
Unit4: Various "undead" enemies
Unit5: Human Units
Unit6: Dark Elves
Unit7: Horses and Mechs
Unit8: More horses, Bears, Golem.
Unit9: Weapons
Unit10: Golem, Goblins, Drake, some carriage, some kinda Tiger?
Unit11: Gnoll, Elks, Doggos, Bears, 4 legged Lizards.
Unit12: Golems (different from Unit 8/10), Big Arachnid, Worms, Floating armor, another Tiger like enemy.
Unit13: Variety of enemies like Kobolds, Manbears, Minos...
Unit14: Unicorn and Horses.
Unit15-22: Here you get a variety of units that needs to be put together... the textures are inside the .vap files (if you use Chroxx script) so they get converted automaticaly when you extract them

Edit: [Here](https://www.mediafire.com/file/nj9u0w6ut82vi3a/KUF2-Heros-Units.7z/file) the link to the steam version files i got.

Thank you for sharing, though it didn't fix it, if you look inside the extracted folder, extracted by Ekey's unpacker script, there is a folder called _unknown this folder contains all the files it could not properly list, these are all the missing models and textures, sadly when converted they are still unnamed, and must be manually paired with their respective files.  
unless you are using another method of unpacking? or do you have another noesis script for opening them? when I use the one posted they dod not find textures.

This took me an entire day to do and it still isn't complete, the weapons are over 2000 unnamed textures. 
the hero models are even worse.

Has anyone found which pack has the civilian npc's, both the adults and the children? I was able to look through most of the Unit.pkgs but couldn't find any of them.

Okay I've made some more progress, using 3 different scripts I'm finally able to get to this.

this can be sorted into working files, it's still messing skeletons and textures, but I believe those are both in the VAP file. maybe. 
i'm still working on it.

Thank you so much for the work you are doing! Even if some of the models are just lost it's way more than there was 2 years ago.

Has any other model packs been unpacked or models found for this game? I'm happy with what was unearthed after all these years, but there are still a lot of NPCs (mostly townsfolk and children) that don't seem to be in any of the packs. Should I keep hope or finally give up?
