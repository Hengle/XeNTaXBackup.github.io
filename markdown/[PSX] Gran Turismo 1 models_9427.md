- Post Title: [PSX] Gran Turismo 1 models

hi, looking for someone who's interested in ripping car models from this game. if there any other topic about it, link me there, because search shown only topics about gt3-5 archives/models.

cars are probably stored in CAR.DAT file.
there are 1376 files inside of it.
there are 2 types of files with different headers:
 @(#)GT-C TEX - probably texture
 @(#)GT-C AR - probably car mesh.

here ends my knowledge, because i didn't find anything familiar in those files. maybe they are compressed.

will upload splitting tool if someone is interested.

Use ZModeller 1.7, it can import Gran Turismo 1 and 2 models.
And Textures are RAW, open it with photo shop, or with irfan view

Hi Denis !

Thank's for your help.

Did you have any similar tools for others GT game ?

I know they are a lot of them, but none have so much options.

GT2Vol.zip
So it's universal for both GT1 and GT2? Never tested that, but sounds great by itself.

I actually have two GT3 unpackers aswell.

I didn't tested yet, but I think it will work only with GT2 .
(if you even want to try, rename your cars.dat of GT1 by GT2.VOL).

Sure, I have uploaded them right at my site > [http://gtr.uk.pn/forum/downloads.php?do=cat&id=22](http://gtr.uk.pn/forum/downloads.php?do=cat&id=22)

Some files needed re-upload, thus reminded me to reupload GT3Vol, GT2Vol and the GT3FSExtract. Have fun 

Attached GT3FSExtract as I can't add attach more than 1 file.
