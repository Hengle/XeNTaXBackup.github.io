Hi mate,

I had a look at this game once before - can't remember whether I couldn't retermine the format, or whether I just kinda gave up  - so I will look at it again for you.

Exactly the same as halo. Or close to it.

Same as halo. There is a LOT to these files. So don't think you can make some script or w/e and be on your way. The tag offsets are precalculated memory addresses. There are 120 different tag layouts, that have numerous field types, references to other tags, and strings. Raw data, in the case of models is compressed into a format with 7? sections.

Long story short you won't find someone who will make an app for these files. I'd suggest poking around on halo modding sites for more info and possibly try the apps for halo games.
