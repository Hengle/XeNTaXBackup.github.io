- Post Title: Megamind (PS3) - .package file

I'm trying to rip the models from an old megamind game for laughs because i want funny blue man's model. i got past the .psarc file but the tool spit out a .package file. it's not .PKG i guess because the tool i tried dumping that with wouldn't recognize it. googling it just brings up results for .PKG. any help?
