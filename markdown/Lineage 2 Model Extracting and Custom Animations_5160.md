- Post Title: Lineage 2 Model Extracting and Custom Animations

Hey, can anyone help me understand how to extract L2 models and animations? I've downloaded a countless number of "viewers" and file extractors, but I can't seem to get what I want from this game.

I know there's a backdoor, finding it (or knowing how to find it) seems to be the problem. Does anyone have experience viewing L2 character models? I already know how to view static meshes - but I can't ever seem to find the character models. 

Also, I've used Total Commander to try and "unzip" the packaged files, but I keep getting an "error in packed file %1.ukx!" or other files. 

I've found some interest in modifying the game since it runs on the Unreal2 engine, and I've seen some pretty sweet mods of character animations and skill modifications. 

I know this may be an old game, that many people may have forgotten about, but if you have knowledge with using the Unreal engine please leave a few tips - Thank you!

I think [this link](http://www.gildor.org/smf/index.php/board,3.0.html) can help you.

yes i tried the umodel but that is unable to open the animation files. I know there is a convertor on that site that can import and export animation aswell  but that one is for money , I was wondering if there were any other way to  bring these in max or maya with animations

 (???) umodel and all its functions are totally free...you can extract meshes with bones and animations from Lineage 2 exporting those to psk and psa formats.
