- Post Title: (Help) Blood On the Clocktower asset extraction

Hello, all. I've recently been trying to acquire graphic and audio assets from within this game (Blood On the Clocktower): 

[https://github.com/ThePandemoniumInstitute/botc-release](https://github.com/ThePandemoniumInstitute/botc-release)

A number of these file formats are foreign to me though (for example: .pak, .asar, .bin, and .yml file extensions). As I'm entirely unfamiliar to extracting assets from games, I've decided to ask for help. Any advice or help would be appreciated, thanks.
