- Post Title: Split/Second PC Demo

Hi! I was just installing the PC Demo of Split/Second. During the installation there's a little song playing that isn't included in the main music archive. Is there any way to extract the installation archive and thus getting hands on that paticular song?
The Demo is downloadable here: [http://www.gamershell.com/download_59236.shtml](http://www.gamershell.com/download_59236.shtml). It also has a fast Torrent attached. Any help is highly appreciated!

encase you have no luck extracting it from the install you can always record it while it plays during installation.

Yes of course - but only the analogue signal. I just want the source file. Maybe there is a possibility to extract it out of the RAM image while it plays? Coul be hard to find though among 4GB of data...
As said, extracting would be far better. I guess it's an MP3 as all the other audio files are mp3, too.

have you tried using procmon to see where is got the stream file?
obviously would be good to set a nice filter otherwise the output will be enourmous

Yes I am. You recoded the sound, right? Well that's only the analogue signal - I'm looking for a way to extract it directly from the main container. 
Is there a way to access the files without having to use the work-around with ProcMon and RAM dump?

It's easy:
1-Run the installer
2-When the game asks where to install and other things..DON'T install yet
3-Go to documents and settings (disable hidden folders)
4-Search the file "INSTALL.wav" that's it!!
