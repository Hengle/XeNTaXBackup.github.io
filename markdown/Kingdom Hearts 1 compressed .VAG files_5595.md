- Post Title: Kingdom Hearts 1 compressed .VAG files

Hello. I have been able to extract most of the VAG audio clips from Kingdom Hearts using Falo's extractor, HxD, and PSound, but the more larger clips are compressed, and without the filenames, Falo's extractor can't decompress it. This is unfortunate because this file contains all of Billy Zane's raw video recordings, which would fall under the name of an0#**##_e.vag, with ** being world abbreviations and ## being numbers. I have the compressed file attached here as a txt that was copied directly from the kingdom.img file. If I had the filenames, which are at voice/event/%s_%03d.vset in the ISO, I'd be able to bruteforce the files out with Falo's dumper. Can anyone figure out how to extract the VAG files properly?
