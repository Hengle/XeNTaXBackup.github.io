- Post Title: Gamebryo .kf

I have got some .kf files, but each contains more than one animation, for example 15. I can playback them in NifSkope without any problem. But when it comes to import (  Blender Script ) only one sequence is imported. So does anyone know how to deal with that, to import all animations from single .kf ? Maybe divide one big .kf to smaller but how ?

Have you tried hex editing the individual animations out of the file? And what version of Gamebryo is that?

I can't hexedit =)
First I tried NifSkope "Crop To Branch" but it is terribly slow. Extracting hundreds of animation would take incredibly long.
So my last chance I guess is to rewrite NifSkope source code... but I thought other way exist =)
