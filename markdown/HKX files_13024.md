- Post Title: HKX files

I've found that Tenchu Shadow Assassins for PSP uses Havok files but i don't know how to open them. I've tried using hkxcmd but it didn't work. Maybe i am extracting HKX files in wrong way, i don't know where is "end of file", i just know where it starts. I also don't know which of them are animations. Any tips?
This game has GMO models, i can extract them and convert to FBX, but i would also like to get animations somehow.

Luckily for you, we already have a work in progress thread on this exact topic [here](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=12857)!

Unluckily for all of us, the only person that knew how to convert these files is seemingly dead.
