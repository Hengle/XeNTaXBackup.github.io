Hi.

What a NICE forum.   

I found you, because i look for a tool to edit "Centauri Production DB-File´s".

One of my hobby is to find and than build a way to make a CUT-Version of a game UNCUT.   

I hope it´s aloud to speak/write here about this topic
.
And i must look around where i can help here.
