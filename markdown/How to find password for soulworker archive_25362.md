Hello  . I recently started exporting soulworker game files for pc, i was able to convert .v to .zip archives thanks to some tools but some archives have passwords that i don't know how to get, can anyone help with that? 
I need to find out the password from the data24.v archive

You can also brute force the password with programs such as Advanced ZIP Password Recovery etc.

I am grateful for the answer, but the problem is that when creating a dump, it gives an error access is denied!

Well, maybe try to save file in different location, e.g. on your Desktop.

I can tell you that I've already tried to follow those instructions and everything was fine in my case.
