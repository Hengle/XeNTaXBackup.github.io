AWEM resources are using pretty crypto algorithm. It is not so hard, but it takes time to create fully working extractor. It is combination of hashes computing, decrypting data based on counted hashes and zlib compression. And last thing - one of hash tables is hardcoded in game's exe file. 

Maybe one day I will finish it

Sounds pretty hardcore...  Thanks for your work so far!

My Awem games extractor is finished and seems that it is working on all games I have from Awem. I will just finish some pieces of code and extractor will be free to download.

Well, here it is. It is working for all *.pak files from Awem games.

If you find any new or old game that is not supported (or any program error appears), just let me know. I'll try to fix it.

EDIT: Fixed link to file.

I tried your Awem pak tool: works very well on several games! Awesome job    
However, I have a couple of newer Awem games and your tool doesn't work with them: 
[Aquitania](http://anonym.to/?http://www.awem.com/aquitania.html)
[Cradle of Persia](http://anonym.to/?http://www.awem.com/cradle-of-persia.html)

I was wondering if it's possible to update the tool to work with these games? Do you need me to upload any files or can you use the demos linked above?

Aquitania and Cradle of Persia are older games and maybe there is another file format. The same problem is for Golden Trails. But I'll check them.
