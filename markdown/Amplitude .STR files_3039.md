its a normal stereo stream interleaved at 512 bytes per channel.

So then are there multiple streams each with stereo channels?  It's got different parts of the song that play off and on (guitar/vocals/etc)

My guess would be something like that yes.
because i cannot imagine they made a realtime filtering engine that filters
it all out on the spot during the gameplay 

there is now an basic STR converter in the new Jaeder Naub thing to be tested.

[http://jaedernaub.ath.cx](http://jaedernaub.ath.cx)

use the File/Load on menu, click "Load into jadernaub" on the STR file.
go to the menu, click the Amplitude STR Split. and select the output file.

so far only tried it on the file you provided, so i cant promise it works on eveyone! =D

but let me know how it works later so i can fix quirks and bugs.

many games use the .str video format, I can provide tons of .str videos if you want...

There is a huge difference between audio STR and video STR files.

it figures they would, i just said that in case you're interested though...
there are quite a lot of programs to play str video files too...

edit:
hey i found some str audio files in the ps2 xploder
they are in the ADS folder and they are named music.str and voice.str
there is also one more folder named STRM which has more .str files
xploder isn't a game though, its a game cheating device like action replay and gameshark

I buy psx games weekly at 5 euros so I can look at some right now

games edit:
harvest moon for psx has a folder named str but its just xa audio along with a 31mb dummy.dat file
in this case str probably means soundtrack...
yugioh uses str video
legend of legaia has video str too
ehrgeiz uses str video files (not exactly sure but there are some xa files so they must be the audio files)
vagrant story uses .dat files and I'm not in the mood to rip anything right now...
tombi 2 uses xa audio and str video files
metal gear solid has xa files (not sure about this either) inside dat ones i ripped them once with PSound and again str videos
the unholy war uses xa audio and str video (I'm getting bored of saying this...)
grandia use str video and I haven't found the audio yet...

Hmm, that must be just a preview sound.  Dang, I was hoping the separated streams wouldn't be in the ARK, but I'm sure they probably are.

i don't know if it will help at all though...

Yeah, the issue is that the useful audio is actually inside the ark, which has is a different version than the Guitar Hero games, meaning it can't be opened.
