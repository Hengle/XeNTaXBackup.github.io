- Post Title: Extracting Babel Engine dat/fat files? (The Crew 2)

Hello y'all.

I have a question regarding the Babel engine, which The Crew 2 is running on.
The game's content is packed in Dat/Fat files and I have been wondering if anyone knows of a tool to extract data from those files.
I'm looking for UI textures, vehicle models/textures and sounds.

I've heard some games like Far Cry 5 use Dat/Fat, but apparently those are on a different engine and might not work on Babel.

I hope someone here knows any useful tools.
cheers!
