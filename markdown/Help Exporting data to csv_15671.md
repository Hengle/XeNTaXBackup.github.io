- Post Title: Help: Exporting data to csv

Hi Everyone!

Can someone help me unpack the files and make it to csv or xml format?
These files are from tantra online with (tfx format)
[http://www.mediafire.com/file/u1g7sv7i1hk1c04/tfx.rar](http://www.mediafire.com/file/u1g7sv7i1hk1c04/tfx.rar)
It contains the skill animation data and key commands for the game files, 
the game uses xml,xls or csv as the default in editing the server files.
I'm trying to add new skill animations but it's still limited since i can only 
replace the files instead of adding a new one.
I am looking for the same file as the hpk unpacker and I am willing to pay as well.
Please pm me for further details.


Happy new year.
