- Post Title: War of the Rings H2O Format

Hi, i hacked the file format H2O used by War of the Rings from Liquid Entertainment, ive posted a format spec over here:
[http://www.geocities.com/sigget2003/wotr/H2OFORMAT.txt](http://www.geocities.com/sigget2003/wotr/H2OFORMAT.txt)

I'm not about to learn vb6.0 to add this into multiex myself, perhaps if you upgrade to vb.net ill write a plugin using c#.

Anyway, there's the format if you feel like adding support for it.

=)
