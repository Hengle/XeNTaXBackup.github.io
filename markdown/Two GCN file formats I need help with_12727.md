- Post Title: Two GCN file formats I need help with

I've been wanting to properly get at the models for the Gamecube games Cel Damage and Go! Go! Hypergrind! for a really long time now. The closest I've gotten is screencapping them through Dolphin, but they always end up in the pose they were in at the time I took the screencap, and not only is altering them into a T-pose extremely hard, but they're also near impossible to rig once I do.

The file format for GGH appears to be .amd, while the file format for CD is...strange. Everything seems to be packed away inside various files, such as .dat, .cut, and .pix.

If anyone can help me, I would appreciate it a lot. Thank you.
