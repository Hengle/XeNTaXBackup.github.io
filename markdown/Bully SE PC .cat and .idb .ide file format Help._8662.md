- Post Title: Bully SE PC .cat and .idb .ide file format Help.

Hey, I am BullyIMod123 from bully-board.com and the bully modding community. We have been working for months now to crack the various files in the game Bully: Scholarship Edition for pc and have gotten some serious headway in making this game fully moddable. However there are a few things we need some help with since noone has been able to get these last details figured out.?

We are working to figure out the formats of a couple files that will allow full modding of fighting styles, some model information and allow modding the game a bit easier.

let me cut to the chase. 

The files we need help figuring out are the following: the format of the .CAT files located in the act.img archive located in the bully game folder under the folder ACT, and in the OBJECTS folder there is another archive called ide.img. This archive has a bunch of .idb files located in it and far as I can tell, they seem to be either a encrypted or possibly compiled/encoded version of the .ide (item definition files) files that are located in the same folder. The .ide files do not need figuring out since those are standard gta item definition files, but the .idb files are loaded after the .ide files and those are what we are mainly concentrating on. If someone can figure out how those files are created and maybe use the .ide files as a base (I am attaching the default.idb and default.ide files here for comparison) 

Maybe this will help in figuring out the format since noone in the community has been able to figure this out. The only current way of modding this file is via hex editing and that method is extremely unreliable and tends to glitch the game up and we are trying to find a better way.
Would anyone be interested in helping tackle this? 

Btw, I am attaching one of the .cat files here too to see if the format of that can also be possibly figured out since as far as I know, the .cat files deal with animation for everything in the game. The file header doesn't give any clues as to what format the file is in and I have never found this type of file in any other game before.

Thx in advance for any help in this matter.
