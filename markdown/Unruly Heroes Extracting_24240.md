- Post Title: Unruly Heroes Extracting

I recently extracted the very hero apk. There are a lot of textures, but there are only a few atlas files and skel files. This file is a texture and bone file for spine2D character animation.
I make sure that the obb package I extracted is complete.
Is there a friend who can help answer?
