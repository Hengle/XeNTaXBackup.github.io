Hi there, 

I got a file with unknown format, I think it's a png or image file, It's really hard for me to write script to 
extract it. Can some one help me or give me some clue?

Clover, a shooter game, I want to get the particle of the game for my study use.

This is a mobile game, full of bullets, effect is very cool.
you can down load the game from iTunes [https://itunes.apple.com/cn/app/lei-tin ... 80891?mt=8](https://itunes.apple.com/cn/app/lei-ting-zhan-ji/id789680891?mt=8) in China.
