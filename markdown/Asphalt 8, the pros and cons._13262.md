- Post Title: Asphalt 8, the pros and cons.

Asphalt 8 seems to be good, but not the best game so far.
I'm gonna list some of my pros and cons
PROS
- The soundtrack
- Some of the cars
- Paint of the cars
- I can't think of anything else lol

CONS
- Most of the time, you wreck
- Traffic cars
- Multiplayer aka kids that used their own money on a mobile game
- Hack saves don't work at all
- Coins and tokens cost too much
- You need a internet connection to do almost anything
- High-priced cars that don't award you anything at all

- High-priced cars that don't award you anything at all Cons basically sum up this game if you also include hackers on the Windows platform of this game. Also there is fake speed and even inaccurate discounts whenever cars go on sell. The worse thing for me would be R&D...It's basically a cash grab and you must do it nearly every 3 hours a day if you want to avoid paying money or using tokens.

I do like this game, but it could be better if Gameloft wasn't so greedy...

The worst thing for me about this game that irritates me is that it's useless without internet connection

The more I know about this game, the more I like the fact that the last Asphalt game I was playing was Asphalt 4.
It was cool on NGage 2 platform.
Though it's dead now...
