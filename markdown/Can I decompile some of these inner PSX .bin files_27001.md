- Post Title: Can I decompile some of these inner PSX .bin files?

As you know, I'm in need of sound effects and some music tracks. But some of these games don't have SFX available on sounds resource, so I'll have to extract them myself. I'm looking at these .bin files (via jpsxdec) of some of these games and I noticed that some contain files in unknown formats. Maybe these unknown format files contain the sound effects.

First off: Crash Bandicoot: Warped; it contains system.CNF, SCUS 942.44, alot of .NSD and .NSF, WARPSCUS.BIN, CDEMO.STR, SPYRO.EXE, WAD.WAD, and ZDUMMY.

Next: Crisis Beat Europe; SILENCE.WAV, SYSTEM.CNF, SLES 027.93

Third: Jackie Chan Stuntmaster; BEHAVE.TXT, TAGFILE.TXT, .AMS .CLP under AMBIENCE folder, .WAX and .WAP under FX folder, .SS under SCRIPTS folder, .DLG under DIALOGUE folder, .sir under MUSIC folder, .1 files under XC folder, .CON .TIM .CEL .DEF under TIM folder, .LCF .GCF under RTARGET folder, and .RR under RCHARS folder.

Fourth, Rayman 1 and Rayman Brain Games - both for PSX.

You won't say it's impossible to extract the sound effects from these inner files, will you? These sounds will be crucial for my 3D movie. Please respond if you do have an answer for the above games.
