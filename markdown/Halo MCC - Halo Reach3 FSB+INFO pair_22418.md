- Post Title: Halo MCC - Halo Reach/3 FSB+INFO pair

The FSB's used for the audio in Halo Reach and Halo 3 all have a .info companion file that contains full file paths for audio contained in the FSB.

The FSB files themselves seem to just be completely normal, no adjustments to the format so it's really just a matter of figuring out how to pair the full path names to the data in the FSB and extracting the files with those paths.
