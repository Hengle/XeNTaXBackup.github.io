- Post Title: Screamer 4x4 Problems

Hi, I've tried using the extractor on Screamer 4x4 but it doesnt seem to extract any useful files. Just File1 File2 File3 etc etc...

The contents of these of files are nonsense.

I opened the extractor, then opened the .cod file, then got nonsense.

Please help

Jimbo

This is for Game Extractor? You should email [Watto](http://forum.xentax.com/profile.php?mode=viewprofile&u=303) about it.

Hey yeah sorry mr mouse - like i said I redirect many of the Game Extractor people to the forums for help with game requests - they don't normally come here for help with plugins not working.

I will take a look at the screamer plugin when I get home, but it is probably because the Screamer 4x4 plugin only works in the Full Version of Game Extractor.

The immediate solution would be to purchase the full version, or when I get home I can try to make it compatable with the basic version. Send me an email anyway as a reminder.
