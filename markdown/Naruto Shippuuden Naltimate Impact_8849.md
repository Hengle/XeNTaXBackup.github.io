I'm sorry to bump this, but i want to ask it again "does anyone know how to extract the file ?"
the USRDIR folder consists of these files :


i believe the models are in 0009.bin and 0011.bin
i tried to extract it using offzip.exe but the results is :


i also tried open the .bin using Neosis, but it can't open the file.
i'm sorry i'm a noob in something like this.
So, if anyone can tell me how to extract the .bin file. I'll be grateful. Thanks
