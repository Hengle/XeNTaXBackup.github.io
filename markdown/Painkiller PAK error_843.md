- Post Title: Painkiller PAK error

Every time I try to extract any PAK files from Painkiller I get the error "Archive Not Identified."

  Help!

  (Thanks.)

Use Painkiller extractor or Multiexcommander. Its easy to use. You can extract almost everything except for the *dat. You can extract the datfiles but you will have an hexeditor to view them.

Using either program on any PAK files within Painkiller I get error messages. I can extract from many other game files but not Painkillers. The programs are very straightforward so I am sure I am not overlooking anything.

  Still puzzled.

That's weird. Only now I am hearing of these problems. Is there an update on Painkiller done lately?

Okay, I tried the Multiplayer demo and I could extract easily from there, but not from the original SP demos. Maybe I will retry downloading them.

  But I am wondering where the textures from the game are. I assumed they would be in TGA format within the textures.PAK.

  Thanks.
