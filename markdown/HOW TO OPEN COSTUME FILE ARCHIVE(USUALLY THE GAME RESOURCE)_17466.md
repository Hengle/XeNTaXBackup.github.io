- Post Title: HOW TO OPEN COSTUME FILE ARCHIVE(USUALLY THE GAME RESOURCE)

Hey guys im really sorry to ask when i just register

but i want to know
what is the method to open a costum game archive

like this example :

i open up the apk file and looking for the game resource (  )
some of them are packed in .unity3d(this can be opened by unity studio),
but i found some game that have the .unity3d but not with the in game model inside of it

and i've found this
[](https://ibb.co/dSwiEw)
it's labeled game resource but in .png extension   and that size make me curious, it almost match the apk size

my first taught is "oh, its just change by renaming the extension"
so i do some test by changing the extension to most unity file
but it goes nothing so i think its a costum packed from developer like other game pc does
and back to my question how can i open that .png archive or at least examine how that game archive work

note:-sorry i cant give the file bcuz its copyright, but i cant sent to you by personal email
   - and im not a code master  so sorry

So... you opened APK, found some .PNG that is not PNG, don't want to write game title, don't want to post sample (even though everyone post samples here without problem) and want a help from us? Um, nope.
