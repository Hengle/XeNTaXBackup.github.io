I've done a simple extractor to .loc Blur files. It's still with bugs and unfinished.
The usage is simple, only drop the file loc file in the program and will be created a file in the same folder of the .loc file. You can execute it from the command line too.

Here is the link to the extractor: [http://gamerspt.com.pt/blur-loc-files-extractor/](http://gamerspt.com.pt/blur-loc-files-extractor/)

Guys, and what should we do after extracted *.loc files and translated all *.xml files?
How can we force the game to read and display them?
