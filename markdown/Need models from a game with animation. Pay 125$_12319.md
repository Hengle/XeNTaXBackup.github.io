The game, like many others, downloads additional files after you install and run it.

In this case you'll find them in Android\data\com.glu.dino\com.glu.dino\files
Just remember that you need to unpack any .unity3d files with aluigi's quickbms script.

with Bluestack goes wrong so I can not download the file OBB. peace 

using the aluigi's script gives me error ... I extracted the files with your software
