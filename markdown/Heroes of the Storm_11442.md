Has anyone delved into this yet? Trying to get access to some of the new models, but like all Blizzard games, there's been a major format shift.

Using this tool, you can get some stuff, but other models simply don't work:

Hey, Ive been diving into this, with many hours and lots of success, and some not so much

I created a script that imports the HotS and S2 models into Max, unfortunately without animation

I posted something here : [viewtopic.php?f=10&t=11209&hilit=Heroes ... m&start=15](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=11209&hilit=Heroes+of+the+Storm&start=15)

So please give me a hand, hope the scripts work

Here is a working script to import SC2 models (m3) and animations (m3a) and Heroes of the storm, requires 3DS MAX 2011


Files can be found on my Dev Blog or SC2 Mapster files ( links in my signature)

T.Hi TaylorMouse my friend, thank you very much for the great work, I tested the script, but I had no luck, script errors can not be imported model, I use win7 3dsmax2011 64bit and 3dsmax2012 64bit, here is a test file [https://onedrive.live.com/redir?resid=6 ... =file%2c7z](https://onedrive.live.com/redir?resid=6A28B826BE5F1236!190&authkey=!AOK1p7bNjjrXboE&ithint=file%2C7z)

Love it! 
Just a question though, Starcraft2 used different UV sets for decal textures on the same meshes, but i found only one UV set when i imported Raynor with your script. Any idea how the storm_hero_raynor_dec.dds is applied properly?

YES !

in my script there is no support for the decal, yet, I know there are different uv map layers in the m3 files, and I know where they are, I just haven't scripted it yet so that it is immediatly applied to the model.

anyway, this is very clearly documented in the Star 2 Art Tool documentation under tutorials and can be found on their official site: 

[http://us.battle.net/sc2/en/blog/124444 ... -1-21-2014](http://us.battle.net/sc2/en/blog/12444476/patch-21-art-tools-1-21-2014)

There is also a way to do this without the Art Tools, but I think you than need composite materials and apply another material id to that layer of uv's ( or something like that)

It is probably not going to be covered in my script though :/

Thanks for the headsup.
I have no problem setting up the materials , it's just a matter of getting the UVs in the first place (for me that is). 
Again, great script!

Here is the latest version with the animation (m3a) supported 

[Import m3 & m3a script v1.5](http://www.sc2mapster.com/assets/sc1-raynor-vulture/files/73-script-m3-import-script-by-tm-v-1-5/)

For those that do not have MAX 2011 with the Art Tools installed, here is an additional script that allows you to browse the imported animations

[Download AnimProps Script](http://www.sc2mapster.com/assets/sc1-raynor-vulture/files/75-script-anim-props/)

It shows you a popup list with the available animations, and changes the start and end frame if you like



How this is installed:
* Open Max
* Go to MaxScript menu
* Select Run Script...
* Select my script (TM_AnimProps.mse)
* Then go to Customize menu
* Select Customize User Interface...
* Select in Category "Taylor Mouse's Tools" ( like in the screenshot)



* Drag the "AnimationProperies" Action to one of your application bars, or make a new one
* You can assign an image to the button in stead of keeping the text

So after you imported the model and animation, click the button

I can only repeat myself: Once again, great work!
At least the SC2 art tools version works nicely, can't comment on the other one. 
Some of the HotS animations (Uther for example) have very long loading times, to the point i had to restart 3ds max. I don't know if that's a fault or if they just have to load very long due to their complexity.

EDIT: I've waited a few minutes, it seems some of the animations do indeed need considerably more time to load than others. So, no fault in the script!

Yes it does, but it uses a more complex version or newer version that was not supported up till now

Hi Thank you Taylormouse for this script, it works wonderfully to import characters like Tyrael.
However I couldn't manage to import Tyrael wings, do you think it would be possible to find a way to import the wings mesh (those are animated planes) and animations ?
Thank you
