To be honest when I tried ripping with it I couldn't figure it out. So I translated it hoping I could figure it out then. I still have no idea how to use it.

Well with the configuration of the first tread i press LOAD BUTOM, then i pick in browser window in the first butom and load the .exe of the game, i only load with the first BROWSER BUTOM the second BROWERS its filled automatically and i keep empty the last space.


NOW with the game running its posible see the GA flag in the top left window of the game runing, this time the GA flag its static cause i use normal mode to capture, normal mode and advance mode can be configured in the options i post in the last tread yesterday how to configure. When you have the game runing and you see this flag press Alt + F7, its very important tell this cause something people only press F7 and not capture nothing, when you press this butoms only need wait few seconds and be patient the capture rate its around 10 to 30 seconds.


When you finished capture you need goo the GAMEASSASSIN MENU and choose 3D VIEW


On this menu you can see the captured data, of course remember all this files are stored in the Working folder you choose in the 3D menu window, no you can explore the tree of folders and see the files, on this case the game have lots of objects only for one Model, like the hand its only one OBJ file, to conbine all the items press right click with the mouse in the Model Folder and choose Add All Models Bellow etc.


Now you see all the model are splited in one model, i like cause finally i have T pose of the model. Also all the objects are stored down in a window you can see and choose obj individually.


You can swith the model to the captured Pose in the Game Matrix butom.


When you have all you want, its posible save all the data in a .LST file, this file store all the data of the model and can be imported in max with a plugin, you can found all this plugins in GAMEASSASSIN page in download section.



Also in Max its posible Load .obj individual, MAX keep the position and size of the obj files loaded, its important tell use the OBJ import plugin from GAMEASSASSIN creators, this plugin  have a XML importer too for max cause its posible save XML files in the 3DVIEW window of GAMEASSASSIN.



I test the import .lst plugin in Max but not works i try today to see how not works, OBJ importer works perfect.

I hope this help you zerox and all the users, to finished i tell you the 3D RIPPER DX works in the 3DVIEW WINDOW of Game assassin jajajajaj then the HACK tool its HACKED.....  
Something times the program ask by D3DX9_42.dll, you can download the file from GAMEASSASSIN home page but other times the program hask by other s D3DX9_xx.dll for this you need search in the net, all this files go in the System32 folder of windows. this its all for me now.
For bones and animations rip give me a breath i try latter.
And remember, cracked version of this tool not works only registered versions works.

MY OPINION ONLY..but $60 a year (and it writes data to your boot drive to stop it from working after that year is up AND you have to go thru hoops to reactivate if you reformat/reload your HDD) And the fact (as you said) the english support is virtually non-existent is just a bit much for my blood. 3D ripper works for "most" games though steam games seem particularly problematic, not to mention no DX10 + support and 64 bit is throwing the dice. Still..the price is right.

Sorry but where you see the price its $60 a year? also where you read it writes data to your boot drive to stop it from working after that year? This sound more like a urban legend. The english support its virtually non-existent but blade (the creator) answer all the question i send he via email. Anyway this tread its created to show how to use the program in something games.

So, this GameAssassin program... Will it work with the Dolphin emulator, and rip those models with the bones/rigging? Seems to do so with that pervy PC game you showed off.

So, any luck with that? It's kind of a deciding factor for whether or not I might want to buy that program to export the models I want.

Either way, the "Share" version seems to, for the most part, export the models from Dolphin just fine. But would registering it even be worth it? As in, would it export the rigging/bone structure as well?

Out of curiosity.. Does anyone know how much this costs to register, or how exactly to purchase a registration code? I looked around on their site, but I had a great deal of trouble navigating around it..

here are the details I got back from him from an email:

> 
>
> After receiving the register code of the program please register the program in the register menu.  
>
> Please be aware any hardware change or the hard-disk C driver formatting the machine ID will be changed also and after that another register copy is necessary.

I didn't buy a copy, since he offers a working trial version... which works just as good.  I also thought 60$ was a bit pricey, as 3dvia and 3dripperdx are both Free! and can get the job done just as well. 
I had a few request, and it doesnt seem like he really planned to expand the current capabilities of GA.. :\ 

anyway hope this helps

$60? That is awfully expensive.. And the purchasing system seems a little round-about too.. Have to email him personally? Seems very unprofessional given the hefty pricetag on it. Really, I would like to try out the registered version though, just to see how well the bone\skeletal ripping works. But at that price and with such a wonky purchasing system, I'm inclined to pass on this altogether.

Also did that tool can rip perfectly from wii game ??I'm gonna say right now that it does not rip Gamecube/Wii models in their T-pose (Pokémon Battle Revolution, Dr. Mario and Super Smash Bros. Melee were the few that I tested, and it went from "WYSIWYG" to "broken" and "crash", in that order). However, I tried it out with a number of games the other day (Pac-Man World 3, Sonic and Sega All-Stars Racing, Sam & Max Season 3-1: The Penal Zone, Strong Bad's Cool Game for Attractive People, and Rocket Knight) and it ripped all of those models in T-pose. No rigging, though, but it definitely seemed useful, even when not registered.

It's not that much, at least for Chinese.
Only RMB120￥(yuan), about US 20 $, for a single license(should be permanently, since the author said nothing about expiration).

You really can't expect a "cracked" version to work on anything considering something has been altered to make it "work" without a license. But odds are it only looks like it will work and in actuality won't work. Buy (ouch that sounds tough) a real license and use a real version of the program and you might be amazed at what it does for you.

GameAssassin doesn't work for all games UNLESS you use the older versions, not sure if the Author is doing this on purpose or because he is implementing new systems to hook into the games, but the current support for the free version is utter crap and didn't excite me in buying it or anything since I could be wasting my money.

For example, the latest version doesn't extract ANYTHING out of some of the newer games and even older games, while the older versions of GA somehow are more compatible. The newer version of GA don't extract anything out of Dead Space 1, while the older ones do.

To give another example, the latest version 305, doesn't work for ANY of the games I tried, and in some cases, it doesn't even hook to show the logo that it's working. While the older version 242, so far has worked for ALL the games I tried (once again, mixed results pending on games, but atleast it works in extracting stuff a good 92.56% of the times).

If I were you, I would save my money and not buy GameAssassin, because simply put, the updates are lacklusters, half of the time they don't work for it, and for some reason, after 242, each one either worked or didn't work for certain games, and the latest version is horrible since it doesn't work for ANY games I tried without it requesting me to perform some stupid anal ritual and even then it usually ends up crashing after 2-3 rips forcing me to restart the game.

To top it all off, the 'payed' version, 308, doesn't even have a trial, apparently, if you by mistake use the free version, it locks off the payed version, thinking you already used it for 30 days pronto, which once again, shows the Authors issues in keeping things clean in his updates.

Once again, I'll say this clearly, don't buy it, it's not worth it, if you can find an older version of the program (242 and 246 are the best ones so far) use that one, and until the author can fix the current bugs and give us a good 'free/demo' version to test beforehand buying it, I would say you're better off posting up the files here on Xentex so that capable guys can look at it.

I buy Game Assasin Licence and i test with lots of games the lathest version of the program, the last game i see this works its with Marvel Ultimate Aliance 2, this never rip animations, but its true this can Rip T pose models. I test with other games like DARKsiders and also rip models but not T pose models, i think the tool need a upgrade.

Same here, it seems to be missing a crucial file.

I tried that version again on another PC and got it to work. I managed to rip whole models, but was unable to view more than one model at a time without it crashing. I might be able to import the model using the Max plugin. I can't find a 2010 Max plugin though, only see 2011,2009, and under. ..

But is it the "full" version which, according to legends, gets the rigging and bone structures for said models, or does it do the same freakin' thing that the freeware version does (T-pose, no bones/rigging)? Nobody's been able to answer that yet, and so far it's not doing itself any justice for me...!

It does, but it depends on the game. If it doesn't utilize GPU-based skinning, then you won't be able to capture the model with proper bones or animation, on the other hand, those that have baked physics animation with a collision system (RA3, DOW2, etc) then the chances of you capturing them will be zilch.

Then there is the question of if they're blend/morph targets, which I don't think GA is able to capture.

Honestly, my advice? If the game has modding tools, go for that, the only REAL benefit of this tool is T-Pose models and in a few cases, bones. Oh, also rip music and SFX, but that is another thing.

I have a  question, my version of GameAssassin is on timeout. Usually it would just load up anyways and work. Now it shows that it is running in the process's on my computer but it doesn't actually show up anymore. Such as the program itself. Anyway to fix this? It just all of the sudden happened. With any version of it as well.

Sorry for posting in this older thread, but I am having a problem with GameAssassin and I hope you guys can help me.

As I was told, GA is the only program to rip models from L.A. Noire. With 3D Ripper DX, the game gets stuck in the synchronisation screen. But when I start the game with GA, it also does! Do I have to use the "Capture" function when the game is already running, and do I have to buy GA to get access to this function?

Thanks in advance
