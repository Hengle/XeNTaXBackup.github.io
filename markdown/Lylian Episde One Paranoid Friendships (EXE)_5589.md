- Post Title: Lylian Episde One: Paranoid Friendships (EXE)

Okay, I have no idea how to unpack this exe. It houses basically everything inside it that the game needs.

Here's a link to the demo installer.

Can someone please take a look and see if they can write some kind of script to unpack the exe?
