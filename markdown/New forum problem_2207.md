Yeah, we have noticed it and are working on the problem with our host. I've been to San Diego for the last week, by the way, so there was little activity from my hands .

I've seen the error too, it doesn't prevent you from actually posting, so I just regarded it as an annoyance.

Our host reports it has been under attack from an extended mailbomb attack from an eastern asian IP block and they had to manually fix problems with cues. It does not solve our problem yet, but at least now we know what's been going on.
