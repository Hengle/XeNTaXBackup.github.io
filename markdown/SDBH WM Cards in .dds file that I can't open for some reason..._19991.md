- Post Title: SDBH: WM Cards in .dds file that I can't open for some reason...

Hi.

Inside the link below is a .dds file extracted from the .cpk files of Super Dragon Ball Heroes: World Mission (for PC). Here's the problem: I tried paint.net, dds converter and RawTex, and none of them were able to open the file. I'm stuck and in need of help in opening that file. Can someone please help me figure out a way to open it and convert it to .png?

Thanks!

Unfortunately it's encrypted/compressed(?) so no tool is gonna work on it, game developer has gone to long lenghts to protect the textures from rip.
If your lucky, some right talent people can try figure out/reverse engineer the protection layer.
