- Post Title: Need help to identify format for .spc and .xtx files

I got these .spc and .xtx files from Xbox 360 game "Cross Channel".

The game uses .afs (Sega?) to pack files. And I managed to get all files extracted.

I'm pretty sure both .spc and .xtx are image files, or at least related to image. They are definitely not audio files.

The .spc files seem compressed, because the file size varies for images with the same resolution. But the file header is missing.



.spc file contents ASF_SPC.png (14.55 KiB) Viewed 86 times



The .xtx files seem uncompressed. I've tried the NFS_XTX_TO_TGA tool, without luck.

Some .spc images has an corresponding .xtx file, as a supplementary I think.

Does anyone have any idea how to get the image from these files?

Thanks in advance.



I've uploaded sample files here. (file is two big for attachment)
