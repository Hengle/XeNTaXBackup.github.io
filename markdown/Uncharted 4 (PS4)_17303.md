Tools for Uncharted 4.

Experimental MAP tool: [viewtopic.php?p=140595#p140595](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?p=140595#p140595)

Uncharted4.exe - character tool. Outputs all textures to one folder.
Uncharted4_m.exe - all assets tool. Outputs textures to folder structure.

Usage: drop .PAK file onto the tool.

For texture dictionary packages it will export textures as DDS. Some of them will be in DX10 format.
For model packages it will export skeletons and/or models in SMD and ASCII.

Most models have multiple UV sets (only exported to ASCII).

Textures for a character may be spread across many different levels. To help get them all, used textures list is created when extracting model.

Skeletons are usually in separate packages. You need to copy-paste skeleton to the model file as it was done before in my Uncharted 1-2-3 tools.

You can also export specific textures by running: Uncharted4.exe <PAK> <filter>
For example: Uncharted4.exe world-city-dict.pak drake
Will only export textures with "drake" in their name.

Jailbreaking ps4 is really near, there was a news in scene that they were able to hack until firmware 4 or 4.1 and the tools are going to be made public.

Other PS4 games will follow. Next is BloodBorne.

Id also like to ask: how is it possible to get the files in the first place? So far, a PKG (PS4 package files) decryption is not possible, so the only way to get game files are games which run with fw 1.76 (as this is the only publicly kernel exploided fw). Uncharted 4 is not a 1.76 afaik, isnt it?

Also interested.

If these files are available for just a few people (like very few people), it kinda kills the point of the tool, doesn't it? Lol

No. It was the plan. First release the tool, and THEN the files. I'm doing this because there are some bad people who are selling tools, models, or files. So now, after the tool is released, files will be available to anyone who needs them, not only "a few people".

The only way now is to get files from other people who already have them.

Hmm okay...uncharted will run from 4.05 afaik so i guess the game files come from the semi-public exploit from there.

You'll have to wait until people release it online or until the new PS4 hack is publicly released.

Nobody in this forum is going to link to illegal content, against forum rules afterall.

I'd guess maybe a week or two from now and we'll see people uploading stuff online, any those of us with a PS4 can install the hack as is I guess, depends what you'd prefer.

No, you don't have to wait. As I said in the first post, ask your friends, someone of them should probably have files, or be able get them soon.

Should being the operative word here.

I don't know a single person who even knows about the hacking scene, nor do I really know anyone online who's comfortable hacking their console to get the files.
So in my case I do have to wait until someone uploads them somewhere, which I imagine is the case for many people.

How do people usually unpack the decrypted PKG without a PS4? With aluigi's pkg_cnt.bms script?

use "Fake PKG Generator" for that.
Its used for making these PKG, you can use it to unpack data from them

Had the chance to try the tool. Had some difficulty finding all the textures, they are all over the place.

And this was extracted from a decrypted pkg without a 4.05 ps4

I tried  "Fake PKG Generator"  to extracted “pkg” files ， but need passcode . where can I get those passcode ?  
anyone know that? or skip those passcode? searched google so many times, couldn't figured outur. 

My "pkg" files download from here [https://extreme-modding.de/PS4/database/games.html](https://extreme-modding.de/PS4/database/games.html)
I think those links are PS4's official download links

--passcode 00000000000000000000000000000000
At least that's what they use at PSXHax

But if those are directly from PlayStation, they aren't hacked copies, so it won't work. you need a hacked copy of the game.

thank U for that, I download decrypted PKG, open it with "Fake_PKG_Generator" , extract files with passcode "00000000000000000000000000000000", it's successful.

I tried "THE LAST OF US" "UNCHARTED TRILOGY" "UNCHARTED 4" they are all fine, just "Horizon Zero Dawn" passcode mismatch.

anyone found that problem?

hi, i am very interested in uncharted 4 model decrypting.
your tool is working with actors,but not working with map files in pak35 folder
i want to decrypt it myself
i checked pak file, it seems very similar to last of us file structure you mentioned in youtube video
but i can not get the right position of vertex.
is uncharted 4 using edgecompression, how do you decrypted the edge compress?

I found the reason.
Uncharted 4 used the half precise float point.
thank you for helping

New tool version with map assets support released (in 1st post)

I found that my tool already supports that. But the way i had to handle textures for maps is different, so i had to release it as separate exe.

This new version will be used absolutely the same, and it will export all models, skeletons and textures contained in the PAK file. The difference is that textures will be exported in a full folder tree. Its not needed for characters, but for maps there are some DDS files that are called the same, but in different folders, and also they may have layers, which will be saved as separate DDS files.

Oh this is interesting

How do you guys ripped that pkg file ? I already download it, merge it then put it in "Fake PKG Generator" but it won't extract the content inside it even I already input the correct password... It says "password mismatch" how come ? 

Also are you guys already trying to ripped Uncharted Lost Legacy ? Thanks in advance

But, I need all the textures in this game also in Lost Legacy, is this appearing when you are successful extract that pkg ?

Fake PKG Generator should work. Better check the psxhax forums for more info on that.

It isn't possible to dump the game atm. Should be possible soon with the release of 5.01/5.05 kernel exploit.

> Tools for Uncharted 4.

Uncharted4.exe - character tool. Outputs all textures to one folder.
Uncharted4_m.exe - all assets tool. Outputs textures to folder structure.

Usage: drop .PAK file onto the tool.

Love what you've done here... But still... I can't get pak files inside pkg file... Already used Fake PKG Generator to unpack it but it don't want to unpack it ( still shows error message "password mismatch " even I tried put the correct password "00000000000000000000000000000000" in it )

Anyone can help me please ? I really want to get these .pak files so I can open them in daemon1 tool and get Antananarivo level textures

That's because your using a retail game archive,  you need to download a patched game created with the Fake PKG Generator, otherwise will not work.

Next time just quote only essentials not the whole damn post, your making a mess out of the thread.

If you say so, can you provide the link ? Don't say I'm lazy person, I already google it but most of them ( .pkg file ) is same with what I already downloaded... My pkg files also come from the link provided by amzerof6 [https://extreme-modding.de/PS4/database/games.html](https://extreme-modding.de/PS4/database/games.html)

Yup, that is an online database for retail game links straight from Sony servers, so that's a no no for this purpose, they can not be decrypted, for now at least.
Those retail links are for those people who already installed the exploit on they're console, and can install the PKGs trough debug settings of the console, and then the game gets decrypted/installed by the console, and then you create those fake PKGs that people distribute for download.

The games that use Fake PKG Generator, are from those people who own the game disc, install the game first in they're console, then they create those fake PKGs that you can find up for download, it is against the rules to post any type of that link, but go search on psxhax.

this might be a stupid question. perhaps i miss a step or two when extracting a PS4 pkg file.
but i don't get any pak file. only .psarc   
needles to say the Uncharted 4 pak tool(s) don't like these files lol

for example, i get files like: 
world-auction.psarc (with over 4,7GB in filesize)
world-boat-intro.psarc (2,1GB)
and so on.

did i used a wrong method for extraction?
how can .psarc file be handled?

thanks

ok, looks like there's actually a psarc extractor out there. seems to be working.

the pak files are inside the psarc files.

you need to extract those first, you can use noesis I believe, but I use a few other tools, they're easy to find online as they're reposted everywhere.

Ok, so thanks for your help and work guys...
Now I can get my Antananarivo texture data for good ^^

But the problem is, I see some missing textures, even I already extract all files inside pkg file...
And there are 3 psarc files which can't be extracted by using psarc.exe, they are patch7.psarc, patch8.psarc, and patch9.psarc
All psarc data except them are good extracted, but only these 3 files can't extracted and I'm sure that missing textures I looking for are inside these psarc file.
Anyone can help me with these error psarc files ? Thank you

Here the screenshot of the error shown :

I saw AO Normal Transmision beside basecolor is broken edit: anything with dx10, I thought it was 2d software fault but I think not
is there any way to fix that ?

Seems I found a way to fix it, equip your photoshop with this
[http://gametechdev.github.io/Intel-Text ... ks-Plugin/](http://gametechdev.github.io/Intel-Texture-Works-Plugin/)

Normal only have Red Green channel and no Blue, you could add full blown Blue layer and set layer to linear add to make a normal map useable

In case you haven't noticed the comment above yours, proper tool for map with correct coordinates in 3d space is not ready yet, be patient.

I saw the "The Lost Legacy" map pics a few posts above and thought I must've done something wrong in the process.

Experimental MAP tool. Version 1.

Usage: drop .PAK file with a map onto the tool, or run from command line

All textures will be auto-assigned to meshes. To make them work, you have to either convert textures to TGA, or do text mass replace .TGA to .DDS in ASCII because they are text files

Notes:
- only exports to ASCII, split into 100MB parts for better handling
- will make ...._shaders.txt file (for reference) with full list of all shaders & their textures used
- only works with maps, so don't try running it on characters, it will crash

You can:

1. Convert all the textures to .TGA and they will be auto-assigned or;

2. Open the .ascii file in a text editor and mass replace all ".tga" to ".dds"

I just wasn't sure if it was updated to support it yet

But where can i find the MP maps?
They are not in mp-common
Or bin-mp which i kinda already knew

Update
For some odd reason i can't open the 
common.psarc
sp-common.psarc

What program do you guys use to open PSARC archives?

Huh ? Since when it's already dumped ? Psxhax site still doesn't have it already...
Or maybe you know another pkg link ( PM me for it ) ? And if so, how you extract the pkg ? So far I know, if you download pkg outside psxhax site, you can't extract it by fakepkggenerator tool

This is probably a stupid question, but are all textures of the entire game included in the texture dictionary pak files? Because I've used the tool in the first post to extract all of them, and there seem to be textures missing, or textures where I can only find the roughness or blended versions, not the color ones (for example some of Drake's journal notes or the picture of Nathan with Tenzin). Could these be somewhere else, or are they just not included, or am I doing something wrong (I extracted all of the PSARC files from the PKG and then used the tool on the -dict.pak files)

I have an issue and i don't know if it's my XNA plugin for Blender

I extracted some maps but for some odd reason i can't import the last part of the map for example

I did "rur-shiva-caves-library" from Lost Legacy 
And ASCII from 0-13 imports perfect but number "14" gives me an error and nothing imports

Then i did "dep-traversal-trainline" 
And 0-3 imports but not number 4

I can give the files over pm to the person that can test it out on their machine

You can try an older version of the plugin, the newer ones are not as good.

It might be that you simply run out of memory though as importing all parts at once is pretty heavy.

Well i import them separately, and save each one as .Blend or .FBX, and then i put them all together at the end.
So can't be the memory..
But do you have a link for the older plugin?

Must really be the plugin then. I attached the one I use, where i also changed the default import settings to disable all the things that shouldn't be enabled and/or are pointlessly increasing import time   
All credits to johnzero7 though.

Hey guys, I'm looking for the level PAK for the Queen's Chambers, the level with all the female sculptures and fountains, can anyone tell me which one it is?

EDIT: Correct me if I'm wrong, but I'm guessing its the Library map. However, I am having difficulty opening the map ascii files... I'm using the latest blender, and the XNALara 1.7.0 plugin Crofty shared. The problem is that when I try to open one of the ASCII files, Blender stops responding, and ends up with the spinning loading wheel. Its been a good 10 minutes, and its still doing that.

map files are really big

Thanks for the info, I waited long enough, and the scene imported. Now I'm having ANOTHER problem.... only one mesh in the first 100 MB of the map is visible, the other 200-so meshes are just points. What the heck is wrong with this?

I can't seem to get the textures to load automatically in Blender or 3DS Max.
I'm importing the island Drake SMD in blender. 
All DDS textures with the name Drake have been converted to TGA and are in the same folder as the SMD file.  
Whenever imported into Blender/3DS there is no texture associated with the model.  
Any advice?

Any advice?since the material/shader was never parsed you can't auto apply textures.

Thanks for the reply!  At least I know to stop messing with trying to get that to work. 
I'm having a hell of a time finding the trans-masks for the hair cards for Drake and the other main characters.  Any idea which archive those are located in?  I'm going through each one by one right now.

So I've managed to extract models out of the game thanks to you're tools, but when I import the models into Blender there are no vertex groups so the rigging doesn't work. I'm not sure if I've messed up a step or something. 
I can successfully import a using SMD with Blender, but I cannot import the ASCII files with Blender.

Heres a screenshot of the files I got from this model.

as its said in title post:

> Skeletons are usually in separate packages. You need to copy-paste skeleton to the model file as it was done before in my Uncharted 1-2-3 tools.
unfortunately ascii plugin erases all weights if skeleton isnt present. So you have to add it to model before loading

Using SMD importer, the skeleton and weights for the model are not present. Which is the issue, and if I import the skeleton separately there are bones in the imported skeleton. So I'm getting the mesh and uv data but no rigging data at all. I can upload files if it's an issue on my end.

this is impossible
check again
SMD must have weights
ASCII also has them, but to load them, manually append the skeleton before loading the file
i dont have time to do it for you
i hope someone else can explain details, or you can find it yourself, it was explained somewhere here

With Notepad++, open the .smd that has the skeleton and copy-paste everything into the model .smd
This has been explained in the first post.

Well I fixed the armature issue already, but it's pointless because the bones in the rig don't move any of the model. None of the models have any bone weights assigned to them. Even opening the files in Noesis and exporting to FBX still has no bone weights when I open them in Blender. So I think the generated smd files have no weights at all but I'm not sure.

A lot of the textures are corrupted for me and don't show up right in Photoshop or even Noesis for some reason. Tried exporting as TGA and other formats and they all look broken and messed up. 

For example Drake's head and arms in the patch1 folder is just a black and white garbled mess, I don't know what to do about this.

I would say it looks like some kind of mask for something like mud or dirt
And if you want a DDS plugin that works for almost every DDS texture then use
(Intel® Texture Works Plugin for Photoshop) i use it and it works   

And why are you trying to get the characters from the patch files?
their "main" textures is most likely not in the patches

Oh sorry, I'm not too familiar with all this stuff. I'm looking for Drake's Tuxedo he wears at the auction, the open one but I'm having no luck acquiring it. Think you could help me out maybe?

Also I'm not sure what you mean by the textures not being in the patch file, I'm looking at the patch1 dict.pak file and all of Drake's textures seem to be in there, although his auction outfit seems to be strangely either there or not there I'm not sure.

open the smd .skel file with notepad, select all and copy.
open the smd model file with notepad, select the first 3 lines and replace them with the copied .skel, be sure there aren't spaces between what you pasted and the rest of the text.
save it, now you have the model with bones

in photoshop open the color texture then the trans one on the trans one press ctrl+a ctrl+c , in the color one , in channels tab, create a new channel, will be called alpha1, on this new channel press ctrl+v (you pasted the previous trans map) enable all the channels and save the texture in a format that supports alpha, tga,dds,png. now you have the texture with alpha

I'm trying to get the map tool to work with Lost Legacy. Everything is fine, but I can't seem to auto-apply the textures inside Blender. I've replaced all the .tga with .dds inside the .ascii, placed it in the texture folder, but still they don't show up. Also, normally the meshes would show up as pink to signal a missing texture, instead they are grey. 

Is there something I'm doing wrong?


Thanks

Hi, I tried exporting a character but when I import the files there are not weights on the rig with it's bones. 
Is there something I'm doing wrong. User's have mentioned a skeleton file or something but I don't seem to see it.

What am I missing to export a character with bone weights. I can upload the files I'm trying to grab to see what I'm doing wrong.

Usually skeletons are in "character name-base" Like for example if you're lookin' for Sullivan's Auction Tuxedo, you'd find all his outfits and head, then seperately search for "Sullivan-base" or something along those lines. Then you extract the .pak for it and it will output a .smd and .ascii, open the .smd file in notepad++ and copy the entire thing, then go to your smd files for the other outfits like the head, the tuxedo etc. and paste that into the FIRST 3 LINES only. First 3 lines ok? That's it, then you hit save and it will import into Blender or whatever you use with bones and weights.

Thank you, I finally imported a character with weights and moving it with the bones.
Well now I just have to dig through the all the files to find base pak file for my specific character I want to extract since the base file is not in the same location as the other files for it.

It's not terribly difficult, for drake I think it uses "prison-drake-base"'s skeleton, for others it's probably the same name as the character. Lot of drake's outfits and head are just called "hero" lol.

Also, normally the meshes would show up as pink to signal a missing texture, instead they are grey. 

Is there something I'm doing wrong?


Thanks

Well I just ran into this same issue as well. Trying to import the "auc-ballroom-interior" from the auction heist mission, mass replaced the tga to dds textures in the .ascii file but none of the textures are auto applied and they're already extracted, so what's the deal here?

Same. For reference, I'm using Blender 1.79b to import the .ascii with an older XPS plugin. The importing works fine, but it doens't pick up any texture, even if I run the map tool inside the texture folder(s).

I don't really know, the .ascii files like you said reference a nonexistent file path so I guess daemon forgot to code his tool to fix that or something. This basically means we're SOL and maps aren't actually rippable lol. Hopefully someone seeing this in the future will get the idea before they spend their precious time trying to and hit the same wall we did.

So what are we doin' wrong then? Cause the textures don't apply in Blender for me and other people. Perhaps you meant to clarify something else in your instructions that we missed?

I understand that the instructions for the map tool are not clear.

It's an amazing tool nonetheless.

I have doubt as where I need to put the textures in order to be picked up by the tool. Should I run the texturedict.pak through Uncharted4.exe or Uncharted4_m.exe? Should I extract those dictionaries at all?

I don't wanna waste Daemon's time with these questions, so I hope somebody who is on the same boat can help me with those.

Textures are not picked up by the tool. You just extract them from dictionaries. They are only needed when you load the map in blender. It depends on ascii plugin you use. Plugin that i used required all textures to be in the same folder with ascii file, no subdirs.

Could someone PM me a link to the hacked game files? I own the game on PS4, but I'm not ok with jailbreaking my PS4 to get the files. I'm looking for the Lost Legacy game, not the original Uncharted 4. I'm willing to tip anyone who discreetly shares the files I need to try this out.

Is there anyone knows which skeleton should be used on drake (warrior)?
I've tried every characters' skeletons I found, like prison-drake-base.pak,young-drake-base.pak, and even npc-normal-base.pak but no luck——All skeleton are inappropirate for drake (warrios).  
Darke (warrior)'s pak files are named in mp-hero-barbarian-xxx.pak.

Hmm.... how can i open ascii files in Blender? If i import the SMD file theres only a single object in the Center, no map, how can I assign the ascii values ​​to the objects in Blender?

Hi daemon1,

Thanks for the Uncharted map tool. Is there any chance you could update it so that the ascii references the shader number next to the submesh, as you have done with the TLOU2 map tool? It makes it so much better/easier when exporting from blender to a different program.

Many thanks for your great tool(s).

Sorry if this obvious but I have extracted Nate's island model and when I apply the textures they dont work right. It's like the uv's are not there so the texture is just applied randomly. I'm not sure if i'm supposed to use the ascii file to get the textures to work right. but i'm not sure what those are or what they do. Are they also the 3d model. I got an ascii plugin but nothing happens when I import one of the ascii files. Anyway, thanks to anyone who responds. Just to clarify I know the textures don't get put on the model automatically. I extracted the texture dictionaries and got the textures for nate's watch for example. The attached image shows the problem when I apply the textures.

It looks like the model probably has multiple UV sets, so you need to set those up.
View the UV's inside of Blender and see if the UV layout corresponds to the textures layout at all.

Thanks for the help lionheartuk, just one thing though, do I have to use the ascii file because I think the original post said uvs are only exported to those. Edit: I found out that for the watch at least the uvs just needed to be flipped.

So i was able to extract most of the PAKs to the epilogue scene, the PAKs are all split in seperate groups for things like exterior house interior house and i was able to piece it together, only problem is the other PAKs that contain the entire models for the windows labled epi-windows-exterior and epi-windows-interior, gives me no ASCII file when i drop it on the map tool, only gives me the shader and texture text files, so i have the entire house pieced but the windows, does anyone know whats up with that?

EDIT: I found out much later after coming back to this dilemma is that, the PAK file was able to finally be extracted properly with the use of the Uncharted4_m all assets tool that was linked in the first post's attachment, i was using the other map tool directory linked in the first post for some reason and that was obviously the problem, i came in thinking since all the PAK files were properly extracted in the folder with the map tools but those two pak files, it was the program's fault, which is not the issue, everything is working out extremely well though, excellent tool.

Can you go back and edit your post, you quoted the entire post, why oh why?

The tool works just fine, that is a command line tool where with the given correct syntax per instructions does its job just fine, you don't just double click on it and expect it to work like a full software.

You put the required files where the game assets/archives are, and run the tool from cmd prompt.
You can either run it from the address bar at the top of the explorer, type CMD and hit enter, cmd prompt will open and allow you to run the tool in that location directly, then type what is outlined in red from screenshot as example.
Or create a text file and write as example outlined in screenshot, rename the extension .bat and then double click that .bat to run the tool.

I think I was misunderstood. So, my problem is that when I try to open the tool, I get this black prompt box, right? If I try to type something there, it doesn't work. I can't type anything, nor does it stay active for a long time.

It opens and after 1-2 seconds before I manage to drop the .pak file in, the tool crashes and closes. And that again and again.

I don't think you actually paid attention, even after i clearly told you what to do to make things work, you didn't even read the highlighted/underlined with red what is in the screenshot, you do NOT open the tool the way you keep on trying, it is a CMD prompt tool, you follow EXACTLY what it says in instructions, you just grab the game file you want to convert with the mouse and DRAG and DROP it ONTO the TOOL, then the tool will begin processing the file for you.
Then i clearly mentioned in my last comment HOW TO actually access the tool via CMD with two more options, try again, read closely.

I read through it and did exactly what it says, just like I've mentioned a thousand times, as soon as I open the tool where I'm supposed to pull the file in, it crashes again and again and closes by itself. No matter how many times I try to drag it into the tool, it doesn't work because afterwards everything closes and crashes.

If you can't understand the above explanations, try asking google or chatGPT, "how to use command line tools".
Here is an example answer of ChatGPT 3.5:

> Using command line tools involves the following steps:
>
> 
>
> 1. Open the command prompt or terminal on your operating system. The method to do this varies based on the operating system:
>
>    - On Windows, press Win+R, type "cmd", and press Enter.
>
>    - On macOS, press Command+Space, type "terminal", and press Enter.
>
>    - On Linux, you can typically find the terminal application in the Applications or System Tools menu.
>
> 
>
> 2. Navigate to the directory where the command line tool is located:
>
>    - Use the cd command followed by the directory path to navigate to a specific directory. For example, cd Documents will change to the "Documents" directory. You can use cd .. to move up one level in the directory tree.

>
> 3. Type the command you want to execute. Command line tools often have their own specific commands and parameters. Make sure you refer to the tool's documentation or help pages for the specific commands and their usage.
>
> 
>
> 4. Press Enter to execute the command. The tool will then perform the requested operation.
>
> 
>
> 5. Review the output. The command line tool might provide output, such as text or status messages, that you can read to understand the result of the operation.
>
> 
>
> 6. Repeat steps 3-5 if you need to use additional commands.

> It's important to note that command line tools have their own syntax and rules for usage. Therefore, it's crucial to refer to the documentation or help pages for each specific tool to understand how to use them effectively.

I read through it and did exactly what it says, just like I've mentioned a thousand times, as soon as I open the tool where I'm supposed to pull the file in, it crashes again and again and closes by itself...
That's exactly what i described twice already as what NOT to do, you cant expect to quickly open the tool to drag and drop the file.

You literally grab your mouse with the right hand if right handed, or left hand if left handed, on the screen move the mouse icon onto what file you want to convert, click on it once, while holding the left mouse button, don't let go yet of your finger, drag the file you want to convert and literally drop it onto the tool, the executable tool, then the tool will proceed with the conversion, after its done it will close itself and you will see the ASCII converted assets.

If you think that's not enough and still crashes for some odd reason.
Follow the two CMD examples i described above in order to enter the example command manually.

Guys, can anyone please figure how to apply animations to the models/bones? Is it really that much harder/different from Last of Us games? I've tried everthing myself but I have the most basic familiarity of all that stuff.
