- Post Title: How can a rookie help

I am not a coder and am not very skilled, YET, in CAD work. But I have done some. I am a network engineer and my scripting has been limited to corporate infrastructure. But this is my favorite site and the only one I have even considered becoming a "part" of. 

So, what can someone with my skill level (noddaholot) do to help the "cause". I want to learn EVERYTHING but i am limited by time so I will focus on just a few aspects in which to improve my skills.

No forum listed is "fitting" for this post so that is why it is here. Because this is where I have already learned a ton, relative to what I knew two months ago. 

I do not believe that coding or cracking is a worthy way to spend my time, as it would not produce results. I am very interested in animation (but not very good yet) and somewhat so in modeling (not creating from base, though) but i do not think that that is really needed in a place where the goal is to pull both from the game. But if there is some sort of need for it, tell me how best to improve these or other specific skills with a tut or a topic and I will do what I can to help.

If I am not doing something productive I will end up not frequenting the site as often, as I do not care for idle time not spent learnig or bettering my skills or self.
