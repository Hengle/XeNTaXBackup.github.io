its a big endian dds you need to perform an endian swap on the file,
so if you read the file in hex like
1 2 3 4
it would be
2 1 4 3

@chroxx

byte swap works but i only have pc tools and this creates the mip maps for me when i inject image into container.
any chance for an importer when i give you uncompressed rx3 container?
