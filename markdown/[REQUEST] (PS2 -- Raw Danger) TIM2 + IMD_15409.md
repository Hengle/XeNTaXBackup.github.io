- Post Title: [REQUEST] (PS2 -- Raw Danger) TIM2 + IMD

Hello, I am having issues with some TIM2 (.tm2) textures from the game Raw Danger! I can confirm that these work 100% in game when replacing any available texture, just that available tools such as TIMTool or Tim2bmp fail to convert these particular textures properly.

Example:


Upon looking into the texture files, I did notice that the files which failed to convert properly consistently had different headers than those that had:



Additionally, I was wondering if anyone had any information about viewing and exporting .imd models and animations from Raw Danger. There is apparently a tool for the game R-Type Final which does this ([https://sourceforge.net/projects/rtfview/](https://sourceforge.net/projects/rtfview/)) and .imd files may have just had their format changed slightly since then. Unfortunately I do not own the game so it is hard for me to do a comparison.
