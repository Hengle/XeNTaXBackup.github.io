Hello guys how are you?

I would like to edit the files ckd for the game rayman legends on nintendo switch. I am aware that it is possible on pc xbox .. but I would like to do it for the switch
I have already modified these files on the pc version so I was able to create mario on the pc version or my son .. and I would like to do it for the switch because as a Christmas present my little kid will have a switch and I would like him to be able to play rayman with him in person
..if someone help me ..and in my dream with canvas ubi from byvar (great man) i would like to edit the all game..but if possible to explain me how to edited the 3d models...i can do fabulus tricks

exemple of files
 ipk: Bundle
isc: Scene
isg: Generic object. Can be anything, but it is still readable thanks to the serialization system for generics.
act: Actor (NOTE: In Rayman Origins, act files are Actor Templates)!
tpl: Actor_Template
fcg: FriseConfig - the template of a Frise object
msh: GFXMaterialShader_Template - Material Shader info
gmt: RO2_GameMaterial_Template - Game material, contains all info about the collision (e.g. can you wall run on it, is it slippery, etc.)
anm: AnimTrack - an animation
skl: AnimSkeleton - the rig for an animated character
pbk: AnimPatchBank - UVs and positions on the rig of "patches", parts of a sprite sheet.
tga: TextureCooked - A texture with a header
png: TextureCooked - A texture with a header

so if possible to edit anm pkb ect...;or to give me ideas
