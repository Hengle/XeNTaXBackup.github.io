- Post Title: Forza Horizon 1-2 sounds

Hi people. I was looking to extract FH1-2 X360 engine sounds to use them in other games. The sounds for the game are stored in .fsb files, but they seem to be in .xma format within the banks. I looked pretty hard anywhere I could but didn't really find anything to convert them in a usable format (virtually anything that can be converted into .wav).

Here are some example [banks](https://sharemods.com/ci0rtoc7hpb2/fsb_examples.7z.html) from FH2. I used this [FSB extractor](https://sharemods.com/suyf3rby6akz/FsbExtractor_16.10.21.rar.html) to get the XMA files. I tried to look pretty hard but I didn't really find anything that actually works with these. XMA Transform didn't work (I tried 2016-01-28 version, maybe there's an updated one?) and xma-parse (maybe I did something wrong with this one, not sure though).

I'm new here, might have missed something, so I'd love if you guys could give me a hint or something. I hope you're all doing well.

You can play them in Foobar with the vgmstream plugin, and also optionally convert them to .wav if you want.

Thank you for the response! I tried the said plugin and unfortunately I get this error with every single file I try to load (example):

Unable to open item for playback (Unsupported format or corrupted file):
"D:\Misc\bs\ExhL_01908.xma"

Anything else I can do?

No, you just need to drop the FSB files in Foobar, not the extracted files.

Your samples all work fine.

Works like a charm! Thank you so much!
