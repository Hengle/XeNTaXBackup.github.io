- Post Title: Motorhead

I wish to recreate the old car game Motorhead by DICE, or digital illusions at that time. I tried 3d ripper first to see if I could capture stuff but did not work. It is probably an early dx or openGL game.

Here is a sample with a car and a track. I see some .tga files but also .iff

I managed to open the .iff with irfan and some plugins so all good there.

I don't however see any direct car textures so I am guessing they are just shaded in some way?

The model has no textures. It's a vertex paint, light/shadow map - similar as for example this: [http://www.urgaffel.com/tutorials/vptut/image07.jpg](http://www.urgaffel.com/tutorials/vptut/image07.jpg)

ok, seems fair but stages has to have textures, at least if you look at mountains in background

One texture can be assigned to several faces in a mesh. What files do you have in scene dump?

there is a PACKED folder with files called tex1.pdi and tex2.pdi

I just saw that it seems to consist of alot of .iff files and packaged with something called 

BRILLIANCE RELEASE 2.0

[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brilliance ... cs_editor)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brilliance_%28graphics_editor%29)

Seems its an old amiga graphic program 

dragonUnpacker actually extracts all the textures from this archive to .lbm files that can be viewed inside irfanview
