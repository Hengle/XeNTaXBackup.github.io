- Post Title: Can't convert .bnk/.wem files from GTFO

Hello. Title says it all. I'm trying to grab the music from the game GTFO and absolutely nothing I have tried works. I have a music.bnk file from the games assets and a myriad of .wem files as well as a music.xml file for identification purposes. I have tried BNK Extractor, WWise Extractor, WWise Sound Tool, ww2ogg + revorb, Divinity Sound Converter, everything I could find from googling till my fingers bled and still nothing but a cornucopia of parse errors and empty conversion folders.

If anyone can help me sort this out and unpack these files, I'd greatly appreciate it. Thanks.

If you can post an example file, I can have a look.

Okay. I have solved it. I was able to open the files in Foobar2000 with the VGM stream plugin. I've got em.
