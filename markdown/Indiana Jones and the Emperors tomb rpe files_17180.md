- Post Title: Indiana Jones and the Emperors tomb rpe files

Hi there ive been able to extract sound files under a rpe extension using the MultiEx commander , the programme recognised them as the same format is used in the Davinci Code game (also developed by The Collective) after I opened and extracted the files for in game dialogue they came out in the folder just as files no extension after I added .mp3 to each of them I was able to play them no problem , just wondering is there a way to reimport replacement files  , the ones extracted are not much more than a second as they are just grunts and one liners just want to see if there is a way to change them at all . Thanks for reading hope someone can help
