- Post Title: PS2 game models needed... almost there...

Hello,
I have been attempting to get the character models from the PS2 game "Shijyou Saikyou no Deshi Kenichi: Gekitou! Ragnarok Hachikengou" for a while now, and I am almost to the finish line. 

Here is what I know: The models are stored in a .AFS compressed file. I have extracted the AFS, to get a bunch of extensionless files, which I am told are compressed fpk files, which contain DFF and TXD meshes and textures for each character. 

I am unable to extract them, however. I am also told they are compressed in the same way as Bloody Roar 4. If anyone knows how to help with this, that would be great. 

Thanks

why are you creating a second topic on the same subject?

Why is everybody so **** mad at me?   
I made a new post because everybody had abandoned the old one, and I was still stuck. Thank you, Mario, for the maxscript... that is a great help. But I stilll haven't found a program that can extract the fpks. I have tried a bunch of fpk extractors, and none of them have recognized the files as fpacks. All I need to know is which one Chrrox used to extract them... that one worked. 

Im sorry I reposted, but noone replied to me on the old thread for a month or so, and I need those models. 

You guys are getting frustrated with me, which doesn't make any sense. I asked for help, you guys said you would help, and when I asked a question, you gave me roundabout answers and answers to other questions. All I need is an fpk extractor which works with these files. 

All I wanted when I came to this forum was friendly help. I have been polite, and friendly. Why is doing a simple task like reverse-engineering a few models so **** hard?
