- Post Title: X-Heros （.bag）

This is Chinese game [http://tuji.163.com/](http://tuji.163.com/)
I used 1gab_2gab_bag.bms to unpack .bag files successful
then I have many .dat files.
but all files has been renamed，and I think also have many files in .bag not get.
In fact,I can't find any prompt to tell me this .primitives and .visual is a pair 
Have better one to unpack .bag?
here is a .bag file [http://www.mediafire.com/file/b9incgxbf ... 2.bag/file](http://www.mediafire.com/file/b9incgxbft7eaeo/char2.bag/file)
Thanks!
