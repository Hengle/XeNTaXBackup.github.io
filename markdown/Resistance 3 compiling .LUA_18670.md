- Post Title: Resistance 3 compiling .LUA

Resistance 3 archives contain .LUA source files, but the game uses the compiled version of each script .LC I am not sure why the source is built in but ii was wondering how i can compile the sources to be used instead of the original compiles script, and have the game run them.

Here is an example of the source and compiled script: [https://drive.google.com/open?id=1OFQYN ... 5JTw8vFZj9](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1OFQYNGLlNEWwFHxr1BkC0o5JTw8vFZj9)

Any help would be appreciated.
