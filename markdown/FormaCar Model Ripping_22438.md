- Post Title: FormaCar Model Ripping

So I have been trying with this Mobile App FormaCar for a LONG time, it seems that it was a lot easier back then top be able to rip models from it but since they noticed people were getting the models they have made it a lot more difficult, I was just wondering if anybody had some lead on how this works or how it is done, I have tried multiple different versions of BlueStacks and NinjaRipper and ended up with nothing, when I hit the rip key nothing happend.. I tried using UABE & AssetStudio and the models I wanted were not able to be ripped, I was getting an error each time with UABE. Please let me know if you have anything on this subject
