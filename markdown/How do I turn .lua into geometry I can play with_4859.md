- Post Title: How do I turn .lua into geometry I can play with?

So I think I have some terrain maps made of .lua, I'm not entirely sure because I haven't managed to open them yet, I've only just tonight decided that they were the terrain. In any event, I never really heard of a .lua before I started googling it, I'm a graphics person and haven't spent a lot of time learning about coding types, but right now what I want to do is turn these terrain maps that I have in a .lua format into something that I can eventually import into Blender and poke around.

So, I guess first is finding something that can open .lua files in a visual format, when I googled it I just found references to text-editors for it and that's going to be pretty meaningless to me. Once I have it as something I can see, I want something that will export it to another format; maybe it'll take a few steps before I turn it into something Blender can import, but I'd like to get the process started at least.

Can anybody point me towards a program that will open up a terrain map made with .lua? I downloaded something I found off google earlier, LuMMv0.5, but I can't find anything I recognize as an executable file inside of the folder.
