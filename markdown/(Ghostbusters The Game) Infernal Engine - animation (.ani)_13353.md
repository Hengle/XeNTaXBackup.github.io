- Post Title: (Ghostbusters: The Game) Infernal Engine - animation (.ani)

Hello everyone! I apologize in advance for my bad English! I understand the resources of two games made for Infernal Engine by Terminal Reality: Ghostbusters: The Videogame and The Walking Deadâ„¢: Survival Instinct. In both cases, there are files a character animation, action, and so on with the .ani extension. Dear forum, help me, please, to edit these files. First, there is a lot of text encoding, and then go line bone_R (or L) _xxx. Please help me in these files. Thanking you in advance.

Don't know if you'll see this but did you ever manage to convert the .ani files to .anim or something along those lines? I have been trying to find ways and I just remembered this post existed and thought I would give a shot at asking.

Thanking you in advance.

Apart from the fact that this thread is deadly dead   nothing will happen as long as there's no skeleton.
There's hundreds of threads where animations only are requested without any answer.

WHY is this so hard to understand that you'll need the skeleton first?  

In the .ani I found this only:

Since this were the only floats I found it's hard to tell whether skeleton data is contained in these .ani files

Maybe search for "bone_" in other files than .ani.
