When I used sir howfie's tool for "Touch Shot Love application", it extracted .cat files smoothly but when it comes to .tmd ones, it gave the error "unknow vertex type 2503". Please help me with this, thank you in advance~

lol, why? do you want the models finale00? if so, i will look into it. but otherwise, i'm not interested in this game (there are too few models to be worth spending a week or more on writing an extractor for it). i was really disappointed with Touch Shot that I really didn't want to do another game like it again.

Obviously anything related to Dream C Club is worth acquiring.

Though, I really have no idea what it is.

I can't even come up with a witty response so i'll just post this instead of sounding corny.

It's them right. They look pretty normal.
Though I thought there was one girl with an eye-patch and a katana.



Ya gantai girl.

yeah, it's like Touch Shot. A few character base models and lots of different outfits. File format is similar to Oneechanbara Z Kagura and Touch Shot. The XBox360 version of the game the textures are swizzled; PS3 version is easier to extract from.

after going through the files with choko i found that the file 000.tmd in "head_01_data" was able to be exported and opened in lightwave no problem but 003.tmd in the same folder gave a different error to the other files "unkown vertex type 486541799" what do you think is the problem?

It means the game uses a different input layout for the vertex buffers than does touch shot. I can do it but right now I have my hands full right now.

Yay, I am looking for the tools too, and the ripper only worked on textures, but no models files, they are obviously encrypted btw I found something useful here [http://code.google.com/p/sticklove/sour ... chshot.cpp](http://code.google.com/p/sticklove/source/browse/trunk/source/xentax/ripper/ps3_touchshot.cpp) Is it from the same creators?

I took a look into the 000.tmd, the header started from 0dmt , I think I saw it before, but can't remember it.

Great job howfie, I couldn't thanks you enough for the contributions, 
Anyway that tmd format are properly the same as the one found on the psx, where there were people used the memory cards to obtain the 3d data, or I might be wrong, since it was a tough one encryption to deal with.
