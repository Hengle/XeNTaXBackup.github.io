- Post Title: Judgment pc problem front overlap

hello i need help I'm editing a Judgment game. I'm having problems with overlapping fonts like in the front.dds image I created by bmfont. I've tried exporting fonts in different formats like BC5u L8 BC7 etc but that didn't work. I don't know what to do Is there a solution to this problem?

Here are the sample game .dds fonts and the .ttf fonts that I need.

How did you change the font.bin file?
Because when I open the game files it is there.
