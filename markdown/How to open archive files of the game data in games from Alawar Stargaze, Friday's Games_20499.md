- Post Title: How to open archive files of the game data in games from Alawar Stargaze, Friday's Games?

Good day to all forum users! 

I have long been interested in the question, and what scripts in bms you can open the file "data.pack" of Stargaze Framework games and "data_pack" of Friday's? The problem is that, for example, in the trilogies of games "Twisted Lands", "Weird Park", as well as in the series of games "Stray Souls", "Dark Strokes", "Lake House" does not get to pull the bonus content collector's edition. Tell me, is there a script or program that will unpack the game archives of games from these developers?
