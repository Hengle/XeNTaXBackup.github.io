- Post Title: Does anyone have the tools from the old XeNTaX Tools Blog?

I'm looking for the tools that were hosted on the old XeNTaX Tools Blog because it seems the blog has been down for a while. Here's a link to an archive of it from 2016 for anyone who doesn't know what I'm talking about. [http://web.archive.org/web/201604061653 ... .com/blog/](http://web.archive.org/web/20160406165358/http://forum.xentax.com/blog/)

Would anyone happen to have a backup?
