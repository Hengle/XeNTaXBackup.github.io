how'd you extract the files?

i saw they were in a big compressed pack file thing so I gave up. I ended up using GA to capture the models in a Tpose.

the msh file looks easy though, theres alot of header there, probably bone and material info there... then the rest of the file looks like smooth sailing, vertex info/faces



I'm not going to writeup a importer since I've already got the model I wanted

hello mario, this is anno1404.

I [downloaded game assassin, an English version](http://www.mediafire.com/?x1fgvd99lsoa5d6) and was unable to get it to work despite some [good instructions in this forum](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=5913). how did you get the meshes to work so you could make models? I want to make an index of dead island models like i [did for dead rising 1](http://deadrisingwiki.com/wiki/Mod:Dead_Rising_1_Files), thanks to your help in the proboards forum.

What is really confusing to me is that you created this model with GameAssassin and game assassin only opens up .vsh and .obj files, which dead island does not use.

GA is a hooking application like FRAPS, or Texmod. GA isn't meant to open files.

while a game is running GA will attempt to dump geometry passing through the graphics driver.

sometime you get lucky and a Tposed model comes out 

but as far as mass cataloging models, GA is not the route to take. it would just take too long.

cause the process is like boot GA > boot game > capture > wait 5mins > close everything > import dump into 3dsmax > fix the rip > make it pretty again > WIN
whole thing takes like an hour or more for these current gen games, theres just alot of sorting and fixing.. sometimes it can take a day of fixing
