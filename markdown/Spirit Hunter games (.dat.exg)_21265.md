Hi,

I've been messing around with the 2 Spirit Hunter games (Death Mark and NG) and trying to extract the images. For Death Mark it was pretty straightforward in TextureFinder with RGBA8888 and 2048 pixels wide. 

However, the 2nd game seems to use DXT5 (also 2048 wide), but I can't seem to find the offset for it. Could I get some assistance with this?

The files themselves seem to be just a packed texture with some in-house format in exg format (going out on a limb and say it's "Experience Graphic" based on the company name). I don't think they're anything special to properly extract from, but I lack the knowledge to properly pursue this.

I uploaded 2 files here. One that I managed to get the texture from and the other one from the second game (NG) that just didn't work.

Here's an example of an extracted image from the first game:

For Noesis. Download Noesis, place the file in noesis\plugins\python, then launch Noesis and try opening your files inside Noesis.
