- Post Title: [Need help] South Park The Fractured But Whole mmb models

Is there anyone willing to help me try opening the mmb models found in the game?

There is already a mmb plugin script for noesis at [https://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=14374](https://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=14374), but the problem is that the mmb files from this game have a different file structure from The Division mmb files, therefore, i am unable to open them using the plugin.

Here are some samples, along with some extra files that may help (possibly includes texture data):
