- Post Title: WinFF ffmpeg problem VMD encoder - Gabriel knights 2

Hello everyone,

The question is this, I converted a file using WinFF VMD in AVI Xvid and all right here.
The problem comes if I want to get it reversed to convert the file AVi to VMD.

This type of video file VMD is supported by ffmpeg but I do not understand how to convert
this format. Unfortunately there are no presets and samples that I do understand if at least
it is possible ..

Someone more versed than me in codec I can help??

I leave you a link to the VMD files and convert to Xvid: [SAMPLE.7z VMD](http://www.mediafire.com/?fnr4jn1an41eote)

this video file it't part of game Gabriel knights 2.

sorry for my English.
