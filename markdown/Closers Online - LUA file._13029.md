- Post Title: Closers Online - LUA file.

Hello.

I've been following this topics:
[http://ww.zenhax.com/viewtopic.php?f=9&t=91](http://ww.zenhax.com/viewtopic.php?f=9&t=91)

DL: [http://closers.dn.nexoncdn.co.kr/CLOSER ... lelist.txt](http://closers.dn.nexoncdn.co.kr/CLOSERS_FULL_CLIENT/filelist.txt)

I was able to extract .cmf files via quickbms however, I do not have idea to decompile the .lua files.

Would someone able to help with lua. files?

Thanks for your time.

Do a forum search or google for
LuaDec or ChunkSpy.lua

unluac could help, too.

I did search and tried Luadec and unluac before, but got no luck. I will try chunkspy one. 

But I am pretty sure lua from Closers is encrypted though. 

Thanks.

Ekey wrote "Supported decrypting LUA"
you wrote " I do not have idea to decompile the .lua files"

So not sure what your problem is exactly?

Sorry. I did not stated my problem. 

I am not in field of coding, only graphics. please excuse my knowledge in coding area.

I've been trying to read those LUA files, as Ekey's bms script decompiles CMFs into several files, including LUAs.

However, as I trying to read those files, I get this 

[http://imgur.com/jjHpA9w](http://imgur.com/jjHpA9w)

and chunkspy gives this : 1: unexpected symbol near 'char(20)'

I suspect this LUA may require decompile to readable (this part is what I am talking about not sure, since I am only thinking that this file is encrypted.)

My question is: how to decompile the LUA files from Closers Online in order to read the LUA file?

Again,  please excuse my knowledge in coding area.

Thanks for your time.

Hi!

I also followed the topic from the link above and other forum (One was this:[viewtopic.php?f=10&t=11826](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=11826) and Closers Korean community, they once talked about using quickbms and extracting the cmf files, I was lucky to track the original source since they took down the topic for some unknown reason.) and it would be nice to have any method for readable lua.

I'm not sure whether you are still interested in closers or not, but is it possible to request you for decrypting lua from closers?

I will leave the link for a lua files from client in case if you are still interested in.
