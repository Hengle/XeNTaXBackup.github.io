- Post Title: MultiEx Commander 4.6 last ever release

[https://multiex.xentax.com/](https://multiex.xentax.com/)

Today I release the last ever version of MultiEx Commander. 

In essence, this is the same as the 2013 version, however, it is now completely stand-alone and no internet is needed to run it. 
And of course completely free as it has been since forever. 

I will not be working on it from this moment forward. Not that I have, the past decade, but this last change was needed to have a proper closure. 

From 1997's first DOS command line tool multiex.exe, through the first MultiEx Commander for DOS in 1997 ( [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_rLlX9bQ8H4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_rLlX9bQ8H4) ), the first Windows version in 2001 ( [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mydmznJpCWU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mydmznJpCWU) ), the first Windows version to do away with the multiex.exe and incorporate the new multiex.dll (3.9 in 2003) and many other versions all the way up to today's 4.6. 

It was fun.   I was 23 and young when I began in 1997. Now, time to finally put an end to the project. 
Get the version while the page is still up. It will go down in a not so far away future.

Hope you can move onto new fresh projects with a spring in your step. 
You know someone was going to ask (and sorry, it seems to be me) but how about putting up the source on github?

I've made a backup of this new version - just in case.

I've also updated our history page:
[http://wiki.xentax.com/index.php/XeNTaX ... ve_info.29](http://wiki.xentax.com/index.php/XeNTaX#2005_and_beyond_.28an_update_to_the_above_info.29)
You can add some details if you want. 

Also what about old plugins? Will they work with the 4.6 version?

I may upload the source sometime, yes. There is already source available from earlier versions. [https://sourceforge.net/projects/mexcom/](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mexcom/)

Thanks !

Any plugins that worked before should still work now.  I haven't changed anything to the core. I just made it completely standalone.

It's always bittersweet to see a long-standing project come to an end, but it's admirable that the creator is able to recognize the need for proper closure. Congratulations on the final release of MultiEx Commander, and thank you for all the hard work and dedication over the years.
