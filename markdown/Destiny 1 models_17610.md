- Post Title: Destiny 1 models?

i understand that Destiny 1 was impossible to extract any assets, but i was curios since people are able to get certain games from PS4 and that Destiny 2 is on pc with an updated engine for people to use as a reference for D1s engine, that maybe Destiny 1 assets might be more accessible?
