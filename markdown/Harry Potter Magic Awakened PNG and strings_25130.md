- Post Title: Harry Potter: Magic Awakened PNG and strings

Hi,

I'm trying to extract only PNG and text (strings) data from the Harry Potter: Magic Awakened files. 

So far I was able to get the NPK files and from them (using the QuickBMS script below) a bunch of .dat, .txt, .xml and .raw files, but the png/strings are nowhere to be found.

Script I used: [https://www.mediafire.com/file/58dzdz6c ... a.bms/file](https://www.mediafire.com/file/58dzdz6cmobpx9h/nxpk_hpma.bms/file)

Can someone help point me in the right direction to achieve this?

Thanks in advance!
