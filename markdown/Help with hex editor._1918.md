- Post Title: Help with hex editor.

I use Axe3 Hex Editor on very elementary skill level.  Selflerner, so it takes some time.    

At the moment the problem is to fid the way to batch convert quickly Hex to Dec of any length content of the file. So far I do that laborously clicking on bytes and noting the values of singles or words in the apprioprate order (BEnd or LEnd) . But is there any utylity which will translate me all that at one go?  

What other cool things noob like me can do  with Axe or Hex Editors in general?
