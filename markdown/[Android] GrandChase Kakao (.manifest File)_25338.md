- Post Title: [Android] GrandChase Kakao (.manifest File)

Hey guys, how you doing?

I'm extracting GC Kakao's files using AssetsStudio, and it does its job pretty well, but I noticed that certain files are compacted in a different format. These files are named something like ".dat.manifest" and I can't extract them, no matter what I try, I keep getting an error message saying they're corrupted. Does someone have any idea on how can I fix this?
I'm also gonna leave a download link for one of the files I'm trying to extract in case anyone wants to have a better look at it.. (com.kakaogames.grdchase\files\Bundle\manifest.zip)

Thanks in advance!
