Thanks
Any chance you could Provide an example?
As we dont all own this game so its hard to add support when we know little or nothing of this games files.
Maybe cut a PK file in half and post it here.

I tried using File Cutter in the utility download section, but it failed  
Is there any type of prog I can use to cut the file?

I managed to browse and extract the PAK file using MagicIso  
but I can't repack them into the proper PAK format again.

the one from here FAILED, how?
If you could post screens itd be helpful.
Also maybe there is a TIIIINY PAK file that maybe u can upload, under 5 meg of course.
this forum only takes 256kb MAX attachment so ud have to simply upload it to megaupload or something like that.

Used another cutter found in Troubleshooting Thread
([viewtopic.php?p=13448&sid=67e10fce213ab ... fbddeb9f99](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?p=13448&sid=67e10fce213ab06421507dfbddeb9f99))
and managed to cut the PAK file.

It should be attached with this msg.

This is a CVM file. 

You can use Isobuster to extract from those files ( [http://www.isobuster.com](http://www.isobuster.com) )

I believe there's also a tool here that may repack as well.

Thanks.   
I managed to extract the files, but still need a way to repack it back.
I tried the tool Mr.Mouse suggested, but I think it will only work with Virtua Fighter 4.

Okay, somebody know a tool that can build CVM files? Perhaps there's info on Playstation-specific mod sites?

Is it possible to modify the CVM tool found in the previous msg to be able to work with the DATA.PAK I have   

It seems that is uses "table.vf" as the file list.
