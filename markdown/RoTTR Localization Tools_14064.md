Hi,

After some time and many requests im giving away my loc tools for this game. Tool is as it is without any support or any guarantee, simple as it is. Also it works for PC version only.. Before you use it please read attached txt file ReadMe.txt. All code is written by me. My friend Kramla helped me with MUL files.

UPDATE:
 - add more help with MUL files
 - add option to choose destination lang ID for MUL 

Video TUT:

then you doing something wrong, what? i dont know.. I already told you this engine is very hard, tool is written for my own use, i spend some time also add some hints directly into tool with red color. If you dont understand it, im sorry i cannot help. I have 0 time to explain everything into details, it is very had to understand what is going on in the files, so you have to try it again on your own. FAQ is not saying everything, you need to think on your own as well, it is only very raw tutorial what my tool can do. I did localization with this tool, so it is 100% working ok..

Hi michalss!

Can you update your RoTTR Localization Tools with the new Game patch? Rise of the Tomb Raider has got a patch and localization files can no longer be extracted.

Can you help me with this?

Thank you!
