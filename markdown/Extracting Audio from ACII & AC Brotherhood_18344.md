- Post Title: Extracting Audio from ACII & AC: Brotherhood?

Firstly I can say I have very little experience with this sort of thing, so I decided to ask here for some help. I want to extract the sound files from Assassin's Creed II and Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood, but I'm having some trouble. 

I know someone has posted a bunch of AC audio files on [tumblr,](http://allsoundsasscreed.tumblr.com/post/97775278152/assassins-creed-sound-effects-playlist) but this is definitely not a complete collection so I wanted to try it myself. 

I followed this youtube [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Lj2gfM30Mw) which apparently works for a lot of games for a lot of people. (And also happens to be the method described by the tumblr poster).

I mostly want the voice files so I've tried unpacking the "sounds_eng.pck"-files from each game. I've tried extracting them with the Wwise-Unpacker, but all I get is thousands of audio files that don't work properly even though I know I've followed the instructions correctly. I've tried both the mp3 and ogg version, and I get a bunch of files, but none of them play properly. When I tried playing the .mp3 file extractions all I got was static/white noise, and when I tried playing the .ogg files it just said the files were unsupported/corrupted (I'm using Foobar2000 to play the audio files). The individual files aren't very large either. There are maybe 6 files over 1MB while the rest are under and most of them are under 100 kB, but I assume this is right considering most voice files are probably quite short. I contacted the tumblr poster who had this to say: "You might have to extract to OGG first then convert those files to MP3. The program can be a little to finicky when dealing with the Ezio trilogy." So I tried that, but it still didn't work.

So what am I doing wrong here? Anyone have any insight and suggestions? I know this extractor works on For Honor which is also a Ubisoft game, but ACII and Brotherhood are much older games. Is there a specific extractor for older Ubisoft/Assassin's Creed-games? I've searched a bunch and can't seem to find anything except things that have been deleted. I found [this](https://www.moddb.com/mods/aci-texmod-clothes-mod/downloads/forge-extractorreplacer-by-turfster) on another forum, but it didn't work either. It also mentions something about a Generic File Ripper from someone called Turfster, but I can't find anything about that anywhere either. Any help would be appreciated
