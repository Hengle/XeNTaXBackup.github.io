- Post Title: Darkwatch textures problems

Hello, 
after unpacking  the game files, I got an .rp2 containers which contain meshes  AND a  couple of textures of  the model.
Some of the containers are partly readable by the .txd viewer ->  [http://www.thegtaplace.com/downloads/f4 ... txd-viewer](http://www.thegtaplace.com/downloads/f457-ps2-txd-viewer)
so some textures can  be extracted.
Other textures seem to be corrupted or wrongly indexed,  samples next->

My  questions is: Is it possible to fix those? (I know there  is that magic tool texturefinder, but i cant get nothing out with it)

Here is a link for the original container for a  reference.

Thanks in advance.
