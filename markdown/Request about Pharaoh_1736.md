- Post Title: Request about Pharaoh

Hello again Xentax and all.
Its been a while since I made inquires and posted here, but alot has happened since then.

I have a game that I didnt see on your list, and I thought Id include a few files.

The game is the PC version of Pharaoh

Attached are what I conclude are image files rar'd.

Id love to hear what you discover.

On my list of games to decode are:

Legacy of Kain - Defiance
Dungeons and Dragons online (which Im still beta testing, heh)

Thanks again!

Cheers,
-OmniDo
