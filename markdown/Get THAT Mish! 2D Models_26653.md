- Post Title: Get THAT Mish! 2D Models

Back in 2012, there was an obscure iOS game called "Get THAT Mish" that I've become interested in. The game used 2D assets with .xml files to display animations. I was wondering if there was a program to view or export these animations?

Both the .plist and .xml files appear to have some sort of compression as well, but it looks to be more easily reversible than full encryption.
