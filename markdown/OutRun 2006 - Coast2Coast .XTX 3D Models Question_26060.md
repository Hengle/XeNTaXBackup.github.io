- Post Title: OutRun 2006 - Coast2Coast .XTX 3D Models Question

Hello, I'm planning on making some kind of remake of OutRun2006, I would need the 3D models of the stage to overhaul them and recreate the code on Unreal Engine 4 or 5.

Does anyone knows how to unpack the .xtx files that contains 3D model information ?
