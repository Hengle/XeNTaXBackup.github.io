Hey, Is there any way to open the bia .umd file format with MultiEx, i know it's surpose to open the raibow six .umd wich i think is the same one but i cant get the script to work for the .umd16

So does anybody have a script that opens this format? Unpacking and repacking is possible (big request i know)

Will upload a sample soon.

Thanks

(BTW where is maxbinder plus, i cant seem to find it on the site)

MexBinder will be released with the new MexCom version. Thus, hopefully soon. 

Yes, please post an example of the .umd16 that doesn't work.

Thanks, ill just have to wait for the next release then.

I however have used a different program to open the .umd but have been unsuccesfull in finding the xbox.gbxmap files (level files)

Could anybody tell me where the level files would normaly be in an xbox unreal title (they are not in the map folder)

Thanks

Get the MexBinderPlus program there! Especially for registered users that can't wait until the new 4.2.0 version of MexCom.
