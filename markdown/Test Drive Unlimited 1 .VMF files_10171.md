Hey everyone!
It seems none gave interest to that format so I was wondering if anyone could help me to understand that format.
From what I've seen it seems to be a kind of swf files that doesn't include graphics files in. 

I can send a sample file if needed by pm, since rules don't allow sharing files in public.
Thanks!

if memory serves (sorry for the bump fellas) Zmodler 1 (I think the 1.5a or 1.7) had a filter for the models inside the game.

 I know zmodeler 1 has the filter. and I know that archives of the game are layed before any modelers with all makes and models displayed in their own format without needing a big extractor. because I am working with some research models I got off the game myself.

 worst cause thought is it is a direct x 9.0c game. meaning it will work with 3dx ripper without problems cause I just ripped one of them. but be warned 3dx takes a bit of a while in this game because there is such a broad draw distance in the game. hope this helps.
