I put the Ch.pac and Ch2.pac through RRUnpack, which left me with various files with a .txc file format. I was wondering what the next step would be? I used RTExplorer, but it doesn't seem to do anything.. help would be appreciated.

Your next step would be to add a TIM2 header back to the files. They are TIM2 images with a custom header, that are used as textures for the wrestlers' models. Check [here](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=18&t=3628&hilit=txc)
