lol speaking of gundams... currently just testing... let me know if you get any error messages.
textures have to be applied manually for now.
game has some files with no extensions; to get those models you must rename the files manually.
use noesis to extract AFS files before running ripper; do not use AFS explorer.
if everything is all good i'll try to get textures in automatically, but that information is not stored in the model file; it's in the scb file I think. also noesis prepends a number before filenames which complicates things a little bit.

BTW, there are more DDS files (for non-models) in other game files. I will get to those later after I come back in a few days.

Instructions:
* extract AFS files using noesis
* place ripper in directory containing all game files
* run ripper.exe
* wait till it processes all files
* output is OBJ

Hi Howfie!
thanks to you and this thread I have been able to do a few shots using lightwave and rendering with maxwell. I hope you like them! It couldn't have been possible without your help!
PS: If you could rip the models from Gundam breaker it would be awesome!
Keep it up!

The other Namco game (some really bad F2P game) is done and shall be released shortly. For Gundam Breaker, I need more than just a 50 MB sample. If anyone has the game data, PM me.
