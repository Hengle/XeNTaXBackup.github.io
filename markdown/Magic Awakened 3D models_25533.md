- Post Title: Magic Awakened 3D models

Hello! So I have been going through the 3D Models on a game called Magic Awakened through the RMA Viewer someone posted here and noticed some of the files can't open. When I looked around I found out that a program called 3D Object Converter can open them but in order to export them I need to buy the paid version, and I don't really wanna pay around $50 for less than 10 files. So I was wondering if anyone could help me find a way to open them besides using that program. 
You can find an example of one of the files here
