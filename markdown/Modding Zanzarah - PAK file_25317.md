- Post Title: Modding Zanzarah - PAK file

Hey Guys im new here   

At the moment im working on  a texturemod for the game "Zanzarah - the hidden portal" and i could extract the.pak with dragonunpacker
I edited the textures scaled them at x6 resolution and now its time to insert them back into the .pak but how do i do that?

EDIT: Solved no need to repack since the game is also searchin in folder structure
