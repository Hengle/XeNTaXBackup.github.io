By now you all know that know pretty much nothing about... well, anything. I first would like to thank you all for your patience with my ignorance. Now then...

I am looking to extract music from some THQ games (namely Cars, The Incredibles, Rise of the Underminer). I've noticed that they are all very similar in structure, which is why I am putting them all in one thread. If anyone could help, it would be appreciated.

Ah, yes. Samples. I'm starting to see that's a given around here. I'll have them up tomorrow, when I get home.

The Cars game seems to have hidden files. It consists of: APPSTART, MODULES, CARS.PSR, SLUS_211.51, and SYSTEM.CNF. None of which seems to have anything useful. As for other THQ games, I will be uploading some .HOP files very shortly. I can get into them with game extractor, but I can't for the life of me find any music in them.

EDIT: Okay, I've managed to properly play the files in question with MFAudio. Now, to just find the darn music...

Ignore the .HIP files.

If you're still, or anyone else for that matter, are looking to get music and whatnot, I've found that this, [http://www.watto.org/extract/games.html](http://www.watto.org/extract/games.html), does the job of opening the .hip files and whatnot nicely. FYI, The Incredibles' boot.hip file contains the music for that game, most of it anyhow. It might be the same for the rest but just take that as a pinpoint to go off of if it doesn't turn out to be the case for the others. I've found that the snds files as well can be played in Foobar. As for vocals, I am not too sure where they're at within the Incredibles' files in case if anyone else is interested as I am in gaining a few of them (but in a different THQ game in my case).
