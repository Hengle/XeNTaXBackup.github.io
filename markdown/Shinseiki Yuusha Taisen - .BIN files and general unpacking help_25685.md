- Post Title: Shinseiki Yuusha Taisen - .BIN files and general unpacking help

Hello! This forum seems very helpful when it comes to the more advanced methods of delving into game files for their goodies, so I thought I'd ask here for assistance. When ripping models, there's always some kind of catch (especially PS2) where a lot of modelling work needs to be done to get it in a representable condition.
However I know that sometimes we can get these directly from the game's files. But knowing what tool to use and how to decrypt/unpack/etc it has always confused me, and I never seem to find a clear answer on any forum. Though, I believe this is because certain filetypes are different depending on the game.

Specifically, a PS2 game has a .BIN file which I believe contains all the assets pertaining to the character models. When viewing in a hex editor, the decoded text is mostly a garbled mess of nothing. I'm not sure where to go from here to extract the .bin contents, which will surely lead me to being still a bit confused about the possibe encryption on the model files.

Extra specifically, the game is Shinseiki Yuusha Taisen. It's like super robot wars, but with only the brave series anime. It seems any assets from the game have never been made available, nor has anyone ripped models from any of the 3D games through these methods.

Any help, whether someone wishes to take on these files or direct me to some relevant guides that should help me get the files I'm looking for, would be greatly appreciated!
