- Post Title: Converting world-space transformations to local-space

Hello, I'm trying to reverse animation format from IDOLM@STER One For All, and all transforms in the game's animations are in world space. I have them stored as vectors for each type of transform: translation, rotation and scaling. Is there any way for me to modify the vectors from world-space data to local-space if i have the skeleton parsed properly?
