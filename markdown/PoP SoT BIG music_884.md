Not that I know of, but there is a program I made to do it, look on the PoP forums.

Oh, how excellent, and how about a direct link instead? I'm sure millions dream of nothing but going to some lousy flash and javascript-infected game forums, having to go through the trouble of registering on said crappy forums, all that only to download some single small file and never come back there again. BUT there may be some who just prefer the alternative of downloading a file without going through spam & shit Codemasters sites.

And for those - the direct link to the program is on extractor.ru

For One, my extractor can't extract music out in a "playable" format, and i looked at that site, they only reference my bfextractor, which extracts from the bf file.  This is also where BG&E had its music, but this is NOT where the music is stored for PoP.  The music is stored in the "BIG" file in the sounds directory.  to which my BIGextractor, extracts from, but not in a readable format.  You need some special codec and i'm not going into it, because, its already been done.  I pointed to the PoP forums, because, there are detailed instructions on how to do it.  and i'm not going to "reinvent the wheel" here when someone else already has a good explaination.  So the REAL question is, what is the music WORTH to you?  Enough to look at a flash ridden forum site for like 5 mins?  And what do you do? redirect someone to another Javascript fill website with DX translations on them which slow tons of computers down?  I don't see how your any different.
