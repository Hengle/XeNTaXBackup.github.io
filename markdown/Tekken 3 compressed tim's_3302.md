- Post Title: Tekken 3 compressed tim's

Hi. i need some help with compressed tekken 3 files. there's a link to a compressed file and decompressed tim file. also there's a decompressor, and compressor with sources included. the decompressor works fine, but when i compress the file again it's different than the original compressed file.
 can someone help me and modify the sources of the compressor that it will compress fine the files?

thx for any help.

Hi friends, I would like to know about compressed TeKKen3 graphics. How can I convert them to normal TIMs?
