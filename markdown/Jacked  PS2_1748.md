Hi mate,

I have attached a Game Extractor plugin for both the PC and PS2 version of this game. This is how to use it...

1. Unzip the attachment to your computer (it will be *.class files)
2. Open the GameExtractor.jar file in a zip program like WinZip
3. Copy the *.class files into WinZip
4. Save the archive (as GameExtractor.jar, NOT GameExtractor.zip)
5. Restart Game Extractor.

Or, you can always wait until the next Game Extractor update is released, which will contain this plugin.

Good luck, have fun.
