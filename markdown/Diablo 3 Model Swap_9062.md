- Post Title: Diablo 3 Model Swap

Hey!

Does anyone know a good way to swap the models in D3? I tryed just with renaming/replacing .app files in MPQs. But on login screen the game updated the MPQ files.

Thanks!

Try disabling auto-update, unless it's blizzard's way of screwing simple modders over.
I mean, it can't be too hard to disable the check..
