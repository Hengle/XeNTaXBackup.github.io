God of War Tool

[https://github.com/HitmanHimself/GOWTool/releases](https://github.com/HitmanHimself/GOWTool/releases)

I have made a new tool, and all further updates will be done over the above github repository.
Its a CLI Application, so use CMD/Terminal/PS to pass the required arguments.

```

Usage:
GOWTool [command] [options]

Commands:
wad Target a Wad file for export.
texpack Target a Texpack file for export.
settings Change tool settings.

Options:
-h, --help Show help and usage information.

```

To export meshes and textures properly from a .wad files, you need to set your God of War gamefiles folder in the tool settings first, to do that you can simply use the argument: 
```
settings -g "path-to-your-game-dir"
```


to view and convert .GNF textures images your need to use Noesis 64 bit version.

Amazing to finally see this surface out of no where.
Since you said your most likely not gonna cater for this release and make it better etc.
The following are imperative to fix though, major one is, no proper bone rotations exist in the skeletals.

And also converting r_hero i get the following error.

today I tested 60 r_ wad files, out of them 10-11 had exceptional errors, I will deal with them in few days. and about r_hero, I have tested that, it works fine, make sure when you are using the quickbms script, when it prompts you for duplicates, just press skip all. everything inside r_hero should export.
Can you explain a bit more about the rotations?

You need to select root.lodpack.
 Corresponding .texpack is named the same.

I can extract Freya's mesh fine to .ascii format and the weighting/skeleton's seems fine in blender, but I'm having trouble with the texture extraction.

Do I need to extract all the .texpack files or just root.texpack?

If I extract just root.texpack, I can get some of Freya's textures, but many of them are still missing.

Cheers

And about the Textures,
characters have their textures stored inside root.texpack, aswell as other map .texpack files.(eg. forest etc)
So what I do to get almost all the texutes is
I extract all the .texpack files(every single .texpack file)
With the tool(Gow tex extractor) I will select a .texpack then I will select a "Desired folder" suppose named "GOW Textures"., And suppose I choose root.texpack first, then it will be extracted like this> GOW Textures/root/"all .GNF images"
Same I do with other .texpack files,then I choose the same "GOW Textures" folder, Finally after all the .texpack files have been extracted, I used the gow image finder tool, I select the unpaked .wad folder, then I select the "GOW Textures" folder, then I select a Desired folder, where all the Textures will be copied

Maybe I am not sure, because it's hard to extract animations as people have told me, and I am really new to all of this.
My exams are also coming in few weeks so...., I will have less time. Right now I will be focusing to get rid of exceptional errors and make the tool a bit more accessible and easy to use. So I can't give any word about animations, May be in future who knows

Grab any given character, go in to pose mode in Blender and make sure your in local not global as you see in my screenshot above, and pose hands/fingers for example, or even whole arm/legs and you'll see that rotations do not exist for natural proper way of rotating them, you seemed to have got the positions of the bones just not the rotations.

Obviously i am no reverser to explain in technical terms, but i am sure akderebur/joschka/id-daemon will be able to guide you better than me.

Thanks for the info. If I may make a suggestion, add an option the select multiple .texpack files at once for unpacking. As they all take a long time to unpack, It would be useful to be able to do them all in one go.

Thank you so much for making these tools

Just wondering, in the main GOW folder next to the .wad files, what do the .as files do?

those .as file are probably for the animations, and you don't need them for the usage of any of these 3 tools

Cool 

By the way, the extracted Freya model seems to have some broken UVs. The UV was half its needed size, so I had to scale it up. Also, some of the Hair UVs seem broken.

They are not broken, they are just scaled wrongly, you can scale/descale them, its not a big of a deal. and some of the hair uv's your thinking, they are broken, they are wrongly scaled aswell, and in case of freya since I have rendered her. she has 3 hair textures, 3rd one is thor_hair something.., all 3 hair textures are used, use them accordingly by looking at the uv's and scaling/de-scaling them.

One more question. How did you do the amulet in your preview render? I can't find any diffuse texture for it.

I have updated the tool to v1.1, you can see changes inside the changelog.txt and readme has been updated for that. I haven't dealt right now with the crashing of mesh exporter with those 10 r_ .wad files that I tested yesterday. It will take quite some time to deal with them, cause its a little bit complicated, so.......just extract the rest. and @mono24 mentioned about local rotations, I don't have a lot of idea right now about that so it will take some time to deal with that aswell

after using the image finder tool on her, it will find around 153 .gnf images and copy them. if you have less than that, it means you haven't extracted all the .texpack files. and I have rendered her using only those 153 images, didn't use even a single one extra. and not worry a lot about the names of the textures, for explanation you may find the image of bracelet in lower.gnf, upper.gnf or whatever. so don't worry a lot about the names of the textures

Ok, I looked at the lower right eyelash and that UV is definitely broken. The scale is fine, but parts of the UV itself are missing.

Edit - Nope, was a problem on my end. For anyone else importing the .ascii files into blender, make sure you untick 'Merge Doubles by Normal'.

I tried to convert this Freya texture to .png using noesis, but it causes noesis to crash. All the other Freya texture converted absolutely fine.

I tried to convert this Freya texture to .png using noesis, but it causes noesis to crash. All the other Freya texture converted absolutely fine.

TX_freya00_warrior_chainmailtile_gl_5F9244FFAC97EE30

Read the frist post properly again, and 3 to 4 more tex will crash

To anyone who is wondering, all the 'broken' UV's are just half their intended size and a bit misaligned.

Just scale them by a factor of 2 and then see which image matches their 'shape' the best.

I used this one TX_boulderv2_card_normal_B3F3A564A9A35D34, for the normals and alpha channel, I didn't find and diffuse/colour image so I just chose a colour from blender itself

Do you can help?

if your selecting root.lodpack your good, I have tested r_wulver00 myself its an exceptional case according to my algorithm so its crashing, its getting the wrong offset, I will fix it within few days. I did test 60-65 r_ wad files out of them 10-11 has the same problem rest are working with no issues. just wait a few days I will get them working.

I've mostly got the model's texture's set up now, but I'm not sure what to do with the eye Shadow meshes and the eye lens?

Some user reported he was having issue importing the model, he did everything right but still import was not working. he send me his exported .ascii file and since .ascii is a text format, I opened it in Notedpad++ and I saw that since decimals numbers are like "0.4843246" etc. but in the file "."(dot) was for some reason replaced with a ","(comma). IF ANYONE DID EVERYTHING RIGHT AND STILL IMPORT IS NOT WORKING, OPEN THE FILE WITH NOTEPAD++ AND SEE IF THIS IS HAPPENING TO YOU. A TEMP SOLUTION TO THIS WOULD BE, use Notepad++ replace feature and replace all ","(commas) with "." then save the file and try importing. I AM CHECKING WHAT'S Causing this issue.

There's no rush with any of this of course even if people go nuts trying to work on this and test, just take your time, after all its all up to your own time and knowledge etc, because so far this is great.
And about rotations, yes, if you can later add support for them as with out them all characters will be useless in this state for those of us who use original skeletal/weights and possible animations in future be it from the game or from elsewhere.

GOW Mesh Exporter v1.2
1. I Have changed my algorithm, so now for those r_ .wad the tool was crashing eg. r_bandit00.wad, r_wolf00.wad, r_wulver00.wad etc. should export now.
2. For some people decimal numbers inside .ascii file was separated by ','(comma) instead of '.'(dot) and because of that programs were not able to import them has been fixed(I think so) and now they will be '.'(dot) only.
DID more testing today and I found sometimes with skip all, the GOW Mesh Exporter worked properly
and some times overwrite all, for example with most of the r_ wad I tested, they were working fine with skip all. when I tested a map file "for200_house.wad", overwrite all worked fine with GOW Mesh Exporter.
IF YOU WANT TO EXTRACT THOR, HE's inside "for200_house.wad"

comma was replaced with dot because of the change of region between me and users. The regions those use ',' as the decimal separator like this - "0,481864" instead of "0.481864". I checked that some countries in europe represent their decimal numbers with comma.
USED THIS CODE FOR CUSTOM CULTURE, I HOPE IT WORKS 

```
            customCulture.NumberFormat.NumberDecimalSeparator = ".";
            System.Threading.Thread.CurrentThread.CurrentCulture = customCulture;
```

I Did try rotating the hands legs etc in local transform orientation, and I think they were working fine. I don't know a lot about 3d software and anim etc, I am new. I am using blender 2.83 btw

020_riverpass_010.lodpack, or 020_riverpass_020.lodpack. just see the start of the file name. and new v1.2 is uploaded and read about the .wad extractions.

I've tried exporting models from this .wad file with both the 1.2 mesh exporter, both skipping and overwriting during the .bms stage and tried both of the riverpass .lodpacks. 

Models partially extract for both of the lodpacks, but many don't extract and many of those which do are corrupted.

Here's a bug report

I don't know who to blame?, santa monica or the guy who made the bms script anyway, I think I have a quick solution to your problem. unpack .wad with both skip and overwrite in separate folder. download tera-copy and, copy all 1,29 etc folders from one to the other one, and tera copy will prompt with duplicate files and ask you to do something, just select the option - replace smaller files. and then use the tool. and I think the 2nd lodpack should work

Ok, so the tool exports all the meshes with throwing an error now, but noesis still can't open some of the .ascii files.

Do you want a sample?

name the file
edit, anyway forget about it, use the tool as however you want, I think I have to deal with quickbms a bit and somewhat more with the maps files.
I will update the tool if I get a hold on map files and thing work properly

Hm, interesting, i may be using an old/wrong script perhaps?
Which one are you using?

Also why are you guys NOT editing your very last message to add quotes etc, you keep posting new comments, if you are the last one just add/edit it, its messy and its already on 4th page with lots of spamming messages that happen to be useless, just saying.

Thanks for the update, everything worked great for me.

Another thought - is it possible to add the ability to run software through the command line with parameters.
As:
soft.exe  lodpack unpacked_wad_folder destenation_folder

For textures, similarly

This is much more convenient for batch processing.
Just like an idea.

You need to select the unpacked .wad archive folder, for eg. If you have unpacked r_heroa00.wad into a folder named "Hero" and Hero folder will contain folders named "1" "29" etc.
You need to select the "Hero" folder itself. And make sure you have extracted all the .texpack files using textures extractor.
In the main folder. Also make sure your using the latest Gow image finder 1.1 and gow textures extractor 1.1 which is in Gow tools pack v1.1. And Also Do check the folder if textures were copied in the folder which you selected

but then it just asks me if I wanna convert another unpacked wad or not or press any button to leave
without anything happening

You need to select the unpacked .wad archive folder, for eg. If you have unpacked r_heroa00.wad into a folder named "Hero" and Hero folder will contain folders named "1" "29" etc.
You need to select the "Hero" folder itself. And make sure you have extracted all the .texpack files using textures extractor.
In the main folder. Also make sure your using the latest Gow image finder 1.1 and gow textures extractor 1.1 which is in Gow tools pack v1.1. And Also Do check the folder if textures were copied in the folder which you selected
yea I did follow those instructions 
I have the NET Core 3.1 SDK (v3.1.109) installed
I do have the latest version
I did select the unpacked .wad folder
I did extract all the texpacks
same results and nothing was converted to .gnf

one question tho
will merging all texpack folders into one folder help? like 010_forest_010 with 010_forest_020 and so on?

I don't think you need to merge, I did updated the algorithm in such a way that it doesn't matter how may subdirectory are or no subdirectory. Check one thing that .GNF files(all of them) are there inside the extracted textures folder.

None of them have any .gnf
not the extracted textures or the .wad folder (keep in mind I used the scripts you linked)

Wtf, the GOW texture extractor will export .GNF files from a .texpack file, make sure the tool is not interrupted In between, while tool will be in its last stage it will output messages like - deleted, deleted... DO ONE THING, TAKE THE SMALLEST .texpack FILE AND USE THE TEXTURE EXPORTER AND let tool finish, the selected folder/texpack name should have .GNF files inside it.
Also don't have any high cpu usage task going on, otherwise tool will get fucked up

Hey, great job at developing the tool, it works great. You have any plans on extracting shape keys as well? Since GOW shape keys are extracted by quickbms alongside correctives this could be a pretty cool feature.

johnzero plugin does not support bone rotations. All bones will have random rotations when imported with this script.

hmm, which one do you use? and did you export any of the models from my tool, is there something wrong?
Original ascii format does not support bone rotations. Thats why no blender plugins support it.
There is a noesis plugin that supports that, but you need to export rotations for it to read them.

No, I didnt export models from your tool.

I think when I was doing research with MG_ def the earlier section of the files, I fell like they had Quaternion data and they had a bone index, maybe they have to do something with the rotations, I may test them for once, can you send me where to download that noesis script from? and some information aswell regarding format, if you have time

Each model has exact list of textures used for it.
As I understand, current tool doesnt extract that info.
Without such list, its hard to find textures, because for example, freya eyebrow textures may be in red channel of Kratos torso texture.

GOW Mesh Exporter v1.3
1. Now the tool support indexing more than one .lodpack file, and you can also select a folder full of .lodpack files. because of this you will be able to export meshes properly, for eg. some of the mesh definition inside "riv480_freyahouse.wad" has their geometric data inside both "020_riverpass_020.lodpack" and "010_forest_010.lodpack", in that case if you select only one of the .lodpack file, a lot of meshes will be broken and will not open in a 3d software, in that case I will advice you to select all the .lodpack files using the folder selection option.

2. Now someone reported a bug, that the meshes exported from "riv925_freyacave.wad" eg. barrier_wall.ascii, wooden_barrier_3hit_02.ascii, vase4_break.ascii etc. were not opening/broken in the 3d software. this problem has been fixed(I hope so).

3. NOW WHEN YOU UNPACK THE .WAD FILE YOU WILL ENTER - 'r' to rename all the duplicates - WHEN IT PROMPTS FOR DUPLICATE FILES.

4. The .wad map files for eg. "riv480_freyahouse.wad" have different mesh definition and different file format. because of that a lot of map meshes were missing if you previously used the tool on a map .wad folder. now you will be able to export all the .map meshes aswell, for eg. from this "riv480_freyahouse.wad" file you will be able to export the .ascii meshes (there are so many smaller meshes, RIP in importing them,  ) for freya's house.

5. Now most of .ascii map meshes exported out of the tool will have only one bone(its not he actual bone). these specific map meshes have a different format and right now I don't know now the bones are setup in case of these meshes. because of that these meshes will have a "fake" bone so that they can be imported inside the 3d software.

6. Also since I don't know the bones setup for map meshes, the position of the meshes when imported inside the 3d software will be weird, they will not be at the place where they should be. the reason for that is, bones are responsible for the correct position of these meshes.

7. In case of these map meshes, sometimes the lowerpoly(which is used when viewed from far distance inside the game) stuff will be there aswell, just ignore them. right now i don't know how to identify them that why they are also exported.

8. map meshes should have proper normals and uv's though, just use them the way you like have fun with them.

9. The previously working character meshes inside r_ .wad files should work fine aswell, as they did with the previous versions.

NOTE: I need to understand the file format and structure of the .wad file itself to understand the new bone setup and get bones for the map meshes and have them at their proper position inside the 3d software. I will update the tool when I understand them.

ah thanks for the new update
the previous tool couldn't rip one of hel's .WADs properly 
here's a note to anyone reading, as hitmanhimself said, map objects could spawn in random locations
and its really random like fully zoomout to find em

I want to give this tool a go ever since I saw Mjolnir during the secret ending 

Unfortunately, whenever I run the Mesh Exporter, it just automatically closes. I wonder what might be causing this? I'm sorry if this seems such a noob thing, as I'm quite new to exporting models from consoles-

Cheers!

Sorry in the latest 1.3 GOW Mesh Exporter rar file, I forgot to write in the readme file, that you need to have dotNet Core 3.1 SDK installed. install dotNET Core 3.1 SDK, then the tool will not close. and download GOW Tools pack 1.1, from which you should use the other 2 tools.

GOW Mesh Exporter v1.4
1. Nothing Special in this update, but i have added a option to change the minimum distance between the 'bone' and the 'object' 
required to make rotational and positional adjustments.
2. What the hell is this min distance?, Well Sometimes models have their lods/objects at a wrong position where they should be.
For Example, The Original Athena's Model has her 'lower jaw' and 'both eyes' on the ground between her legs, however it should be in her head right?, jaw where jaw should be and eyes where eyes should be. Also All lods/objects are not displaced, so a flag/boolen or some other condition should be there in the gamefiles to identify which objects are displaced. but i was unable to find them. So i made a condition that, if the distance between position of the 'eye bone' and the 'eye mesh 3d centre' exceeds a 'certain value' the algorithm will apply the roation and transformation to get the mesh at its correct position.
and if you would like to verify where her jaw and eyes would have located originally, just enter a value more than '2'.
3. Allmost all of the characters inside r_ .wad files work fine with a default 'min distance' value of '1', so you have no need to change that min distance value.
4. But in certain senarios, for example in case of Freya's Creature(that big turtle in the game) is so massive, he's like 100meters, in that case if i set a value of '1' meters, the algorithm will falsely change the positions of the objects/lods. In that case you need to change that min distance value to something higher like 20, 25, 30 or 50. so the algorithm re-adjusts only the objects/lods are displaced but not falsely change the positions.
5. The Unit of min distance is in meters.
6. The adjustment of positions will only work in case where "game's original bone" is there with the mesh, not with the "fake bone" that i mentioned in the GOW Mesh Exporter v1.3 Changelog.

I said Last time, that I will work with the .wad files to know the new bones setup for the map files, to get the meshes are their correct position in the 3d software. HOWEVER, I think I will not be able to do so, map .wad files have 100s and 1000s of bone files and they are used differently to load the meshes for a game level (I GUESS). I think the game engine loads the map assets for a particular 'game level' with different bones/whatever I don't know to get them in a certain position. SO I THINK IT'S NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME TO REVERSE/KNOW HOW TO GET THE MESHES AT THEIR CORRECT POSTIONS.
SO, IF ANYONE INTRESTED IN EXPORTING THE MAP ASSETS FOR Eg, Freya's House or Kratos' House or Whatever, YOU WILL HAVE TO MANUALLY PLACE THE MESHES AT THEIR CORRECT POSITION, YOU WILL HAVE TO TAKE THAT HEADACHE. JUST PLAY THE GAME OR WATCH GAMEPLAY OR VIEW SCREENSHOTS TO ADJUST THE MAP MESHES.

First of all thanks a lot for making these tools! Awesome work!
In terms of figuring out where the character models are located in the .wad files, is there any pattern? e.g. I can see that the wad files starting with r_ has character models. For the rest of the files. are they like mix of static mesh plus characters specific to some levels? 

Thanks!

Most of the characters are.in r_ wad files, rest of wad files for eg. for200house.wad is a map wad file, it will have most of the map meshes and sometimes character aswell, for eg. if you have played the game when was Thor seen in the game?, near kratos's house right, for200house.wad has kratos's house and meshes, nearby meshes and Thor and his hammer aswell.

For character mesh like valkyrie, all the variations of the characters are bundled together in the same file. Has anyone figured out separating out meshes for individual (like Sigrun)? or is it a matter of manually checking and grouping them together? Fo e.g. it is easy to identify the helms for the 9 valkyries but not sure if there is an easy way to group and identify all related meshes for each of them...

No dude, when i was reversing the gamefiles i was unable to find some binary data that could represent different skins/parts, maybe it has to do something with game application itself, i can't figure that out

No worries. And thanks for replying. It's Ok to do a bit of manual work to get the mesh separated. TBH the Valkyrie file is OK, its only got 9 different character meshes, the trolls or Draugr is a totally different story, so many meshes to separate out. It going to take a while  

A bit unrelated but does anyone know if there is any script to import a bunch of ascii files in a folder in one go in Blender? I have seen similar scripts for obj and fbx files. But not able to figure out how to do this for ascii files  
Thanks!

Hi! I was trying to extract the models from this a while ago, but with me being an idiot who has no idea of what he's doing, I couldn't. I've been playing with your tools for a few hours now, but I'm having some issues. 

The main thing I'm trying to extract is r_hero00.wad, which I can do successfully. I got it to output as "38 hero00.ascii" and I'm trying to open it in XNALara 11.8. It doesn't seem to recognize the textures (how would I import them to the model?), and it throws about 150-200 errors on import (all saying something like "Mesh part mesh_0_1_0 conflict with a pervious part with the same mesh part name "0" !", with the part names increasing). After import and clicking ok on all the errors, it only shows the body, with no visible legs, and it seems to put all the armor on. 

(this is after putting it into the blender script)

It also creates a .mesh file that seems to make the legs visible, but also removes the back of his head. 


To be perfectly honest here, I'm trying to export the Kratos (from the start of the game, so without armor) to an obj file complete with textures in order to import it to Source Filmmaker. I tried the ImportMeshAsciiExtended script for blender 2.49b, but on import it also gets rid of his legs, replacing them with a box that has them inside. I tried that because it throws an error after trying to export as obj (index was outside the bounds of the array) and I'm not sure what it means.

What would be the best method of doing what I'm trying to do? Am I making one error somewhere that ruins everything? Any help is appreciated. Thank you!

Most of the character files will extract all the variants with it. I haven't tried Kratos yet but say like Trolls etc it will extract all the different kinds of trolls into a single file. So same for Kratos, all the armour will be extracted into a single file. 
Trying to open this directly in XNALara is bound to fail. Have you tried the XNALara import script for say Blender 2.8? Install that open the ascii fil, remove all the unwanted mesh parts, set up the materials/textures (that is going to take a while) and then you can export it out.

Or you can get the Kratos model already ported...Search in DeviantArt.

Okay lets get this straight, I have made 3 different tools, one is for exporting the models using a .wad file, one is to export all the texture files from the .texpack files, one is to 'find' the textures from the exported textures for a particular model. you will have to download both: "GOW Tools Pack v1.1" and "GOW Mesh Exporter v1.4", use the mesh exporter from "GOW Mesh Exporter v1.4 rar file" and use the texture exporting tools and texture image finder from "GOW Tools Pack v1.1 rar file". you will find the rest of the instructions on how to use the tools.

Now, XNAlara application is trash and it steals the data of users, so no one should be using that application. To open XNAlara .ascii .xps .mesh models files just use blender with addon: XNAlara importer v2.0.2 by johnzero7, its available on github just do a google search.

Now if you just want kratos' model or some more, i have uploaded his model with textures on deviantart and p3dm.ru, my deviant account id is "hitmanhimself", some other guys have uploaded some more models from the game on p3dm.ru you can just download them too if you want, although using the tool is not really hard.

Also just read what i have mentioned in the description and in comments about textures related to kratos' model, just read it, those textures are just like it was in the game. its hard to texture him but you can do it if you 'compositing' skills use what ever software you like, or you also download kratos' model by luxox from deviantart, he did the same thing, he also had to composite the textures to get the results, although he has put the composited textures right in there in the rar file. note, that his model doesn't have bones and weights and neither multiple uv channels and he only has the default kratos' skin not the extra armour.

lastly, the models that you export using my tool will have all the armours within in a single .ascii file, and you will have to try on your own to separate them, because while i was reversing i was not able to find a flag that could identify which meshes are armours and skins etc etc. so you will have to identify them on your own and separate them. same thing for kratos, not its not too hard but its time taking, one advice i can give you is just hide all the meshes in blender and un-hide them one by one then you will be able to identify them pretty easily.

hi mate, wondering if you can help me out with the following...
do you know the lodpack files corresponding to the wad files starting with:
xpl
nid
msp

All the character files are working great. However getting some issues with static (map) meshes in Blender. Which add-on are you using to import ascii files to Blender?

Thanks again for the tools!

I haven't really tested the wads starting with xpl nid msp, maybe they don't need a lodpack at all, maybe just use the folder selection option to select all the lodpack files and then try to use these extracted wad folders, maybe i'll test them on my own tomorrow or sometimes just name few of the wad files your having problem starting with xpl nid or msp. And regarding the map .wad files, I have test a few and they seem to work fine as how I have made them, note that their position will not be correct according the game map level they should be because I was not able to reverse any data that would represent the mesh positions and rotations according to a game map level. So when you will import those meshes in blender you will manually need to position them and also these meshes will have some lower poly verisons with them cause again I was not able to identify and separate them during reversing. And I am using blender 2.83 and xna importer v2.0.2 by johnzero7
Also maybe specify some .wad files and the exported .ASCII files from them you are having problems with so I can verify on my own

Thanks for the reply. I am also using Blender 2.83 and importer v2.0.2
An example case will be foot100_base.wad with 60 chest_locked_parent.ascii. It gives a IndexError: list index out of range while I try to import the ascii file to Blender.

i am using mesh exporter v1.4 and i select all the .lodpack files using the folder selection option in the beginning and the mesh(60 chest_locked_parent.ascii) that you talked about is importing completely fine in blender and in noesis aswel, it should work man.

Thanks for looking into this. So the mistake that I was making was that I wasn't selecting the whole .lodpack files like you did but was selecting one single .lodpack. Tried selecting all and now I am able to extract the mesh correctly. Thanks a lot!

This could be more to do with the Noesis plugin, do you have any issues with the Normal maps extracted? In quite a few cases I am having issues with the normal maps. for e.g. sometimes it looks like there are multiple maps superimposed on a single image or some portion of the map just appears white. 

Thanks again for your help.

oh wait I remember extracting them from one of the "cal" WADs since it stands for Caldera I guess and a Caldera looks like midgard's center place, thats how I found him in one of those wads

Hi, how can I convert an extracted .wad file to a .wad file again?
Isn't there a way to edit the game subtitles like the textures you extracted so you can edit them?  For example, know the font of your language to the game and translate the text

well I extracted all the audio files a long time ago and explored 5k files and I don't recall finding it, so yeah
it also depends on which time did he say it, you might find it in the long audio files if it was from a cutscene

There was a private tool i made for Speclizer that was for modifying .texpack files to modify some textures, I haven't added any functionality in my tool to pack/modify .wad files or import meshes, the mod was made using that along with some other things done by Speclizer, you can get more information from him if you contact him.

Thank you for your awesome tool. I was able to code an interfacing tool that extracts one or multiple WAD files (drag and drop), checks resulting .bin files (header) for some Lua signatures, move file pointer to 0x1B+LuaR header and copy the script to disk. Then unluac to decompile the file and move them to the dev intended game hierarchy 

Like so:





So.. once more, thank you for your tool! I will post the tool sometime tomorrow.

In case you want to take a look at the Lua hook in my table that lets you run Lua commands, you can do so here: [https://fearlessrevolution.com/viewtopi ... =4&t=18837](https://fearlessrevolution.com/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=18837).

I have successfully extracted models using the CMD tool (.wad files), I can open them in Blender as .glb but there is literally no way I can get the textures to work. Im fairly new to modding, and I just want to view the model in blender as its in the game. Any idea ? "Find Missing Files" in blender does not work. Tried to convert textures to .png from .dds using Noesis but still i can't get them on.

Any help ??

Thank you!

Hello,
I ask just in case because there are 12000 files to listen but does someone know the wem number for the line "Do not be sorry, be better"

Would really help me, thanks


well I extracted all the audio files a long time ago and explored 5k files and I don't recall finding it, so yeah
it also depends on which time did he say it, you might find it in the long audio files if it was from a cutscene
How did you extract the audio?

How did you extract the audio?


The sound are custom vorbise encoded with wwise 2017.1 just use wwise extraction tools to decode them into a normal wav or ogg.  But if you need to translate the game and put your own voice into the game, it's way difficult but not impossible, we already did it.
i just need some audio for a Blade and sorcery mod, and will the extraction tools work with the sbp files, or do i have to convert them to bnk first?

Hey I am currently extracting stuff from Ragnarok but I am having issues with the image part as they are all just a random bunch of numbers for the names instead of proper names. I read earlier on that there was an image finder to help convert that but I am having no luck and not sure if I am doing it wrong or it doesn't work with Ragnarok properly? Please help otherwise this texturing process is gonna be a pain

Back again, sorry for spamming but I am just curious if this tool will ever see an update or if I am not seeing this clearly but rigs were added but no weights? I imported the .glb into blender and found there was weights and a rig but when I got testing on it I noticed the weights do nothing? Whats the workaround to this as I have seen people upload Ragnarok models before
