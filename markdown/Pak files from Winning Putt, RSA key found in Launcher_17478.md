- Post Title: Pak files from Winning Putt, RSA key found in Launcher

I tried using both the Pakdecrypt written for Crysis and Aion with the RSA key pulled out of the Winning Putt games "Launcher.exe"

0kb of data

I was wondering based off past messages if the zip format wasn't different. I don't program at all so I'll post a screenshot of a few example files from the game.
If you would like the public RSA key PM me.
