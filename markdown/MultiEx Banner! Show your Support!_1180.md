- Post Title: MultiEx Banner! Show your Support!

Ok here is a banner for people to use as a signature in forums to show their support for the project.

And for anyone who doesn't know, this is how you make images link to sites:

```
[url=LINK URL][img]IMG URL[/img][/url]
```

Nice ! Thanks very much! This we can use definetely!  

Okay people, if you are frequently at forums, and you wish to support the MultiEx project, Zico has a good idea, use his banner as a signature. Excellent!

Here's readily usable code you can copy and paste right into your signature.

Nice, not trying to be picky, but could you make it in some other sizes? I'd like a modified version to put on my site (click the image in my sig), and it's going underneath the nav bar to the left (once you get past the index page).

Sure..but could you specify the size (in pixels) as i don't know what you really want.

Probably just flipping the height and width would be fine...
