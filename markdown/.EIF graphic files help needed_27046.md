- Post Title: .EIF graphic files help needed

I need some help about the game Great Battles Collector's Edition by Interactive Magic, it's an old Windows 95 game.
In the DATA folder there are many files with the .eif extension, I think that these are the animation files of the troops in the game, all files are in three format, for example: Horse.eif, Horse2.eif, Horse4.eif, that are the three levels of zoom present in the game.
 I don't know how to open these files and if these files are in a compressed format.
I have attached the Horse.eif file if someone want to examine it.
Thanks in advance
