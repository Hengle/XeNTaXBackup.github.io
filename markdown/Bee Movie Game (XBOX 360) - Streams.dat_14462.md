Hello. I'm having trouble to properly extract the sound files contained in the Streams.dat archive. I know the PC version is supported by ToWav, but the Xbox 360 doesn't, probably because it uses another codec (XMA). Thanks if someone can help me.

I really want to rip the models from this game. How can I open the .pkz files on the 360 version of the game?

If you want the voice clips of the game, the Wii version does not have them in any archive files:



The sound quality is also extremely clear as well.
