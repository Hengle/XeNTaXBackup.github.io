I'd like to get my hands on the sound files and voice lines of the game but when i use tools like Cpk Browser or CriPakTools it only gives me files without any file extension.

Here are some random files from the output [https://www.mediafire.com/file/pl2njtw2 ... s.zip/file](https://www.mediafire.com/file/pl2njtw2wx7atuh/files.zip/file)

Some of those files have audio in HCA format.  They don't have filenames, so can use VGMToollbox to rip them.
