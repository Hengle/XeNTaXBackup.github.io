-open in hexeditor nevermore.mdl and go to offset:4
-change 31 to 2C (1 to ,)
-change name nevermore.dx90.vtx to  nevermore.dx80.vtx
-convert mdl to smd using mdldecompiler (it give some errors but we have mesh and animations)

it only works on some meshes. (single meshes with no lod's)

you can just uplaod the meshes here and then you have no need to hex edit anything.

Noesis can load the models by renaming heroname.dx90.vtx to heroname.sw.vtx but not all models, just some part of them..
