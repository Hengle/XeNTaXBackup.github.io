- Post Title: Bombsquad .bob Format

Hi there, I'm new to the forum and modding games in general   

[http://www.files.froemling.net/bombsquad/builds/](http://www.files.froemling.net/bombsquad/builds/) (it's a relatively small game)

The files in the assets contain .bob model files, with the little scrap of info I found, be still no luck being opened. Are these archives holding the files within or are they just the 3D graphics file?

I've included three samples here, if anyone knows about them it would be greatly appreciated

Cheers
