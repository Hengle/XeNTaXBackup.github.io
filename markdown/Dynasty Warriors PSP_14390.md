the idx should contain offsets into the bin file, iirc
I can't get fiitting offsets from the bin/idx pair you provided.

But there's much uncompressed data in the bin - search for 'skeleton' to see what I mean.

Got some skeleton at 0x3d50, FVFsize=64:

I understand, thank you for your help. I will try another version of the game that is easier to extract. Thus it is too complicated for me. Thank you.
