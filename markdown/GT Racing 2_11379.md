How to convert the models for the game named "GT Racing 2"?
There is no 3ds max scripts for GT Racing 2. I wonder if many of us forget it.

[Car_Meshes.gla](http://www.mediafire.com/download/brmk62rjml1yyu4/car_meshes.gla)
This archive consists of 65 over car models. Many of them is very cool and powerful!!  
I hope that the time which we can convert them will come.

I'm looking forward to being able to look at these models well!!!

Have you managed to extract this archive?

I tried a couple of weeks ago with Gameloft CustomPak Extractor 1.0.1.0, but it gives me an error:

> Error opening archive. Please make sure that you can read the archive, and that it is a valid Gameloft CustomPak. (Unable to read beyond the end of the stream.)

I relieved. Because, I found the extractor which can extract .gla files of too much size.
But, I have difficulty doing with .bdae files.
They are original extension files, and a few people succeed to do with them.

Hello, Mr. TomWin.  
Sure. I found the soft which can extract large size .gla files.
It is named "Gameloft ZIP Unscrambler."
It can work absolutely.

If you use it for extracting "car_meshes.gla", you can see many .bdae files.

I don't know it. Perhaps, texture files are composed in .bdae files.

I was going to upload some bdae file here, but I didnt have time yesterday.

Maybe you nosfornos could you upload some bdae file for some skilled programer can make max script or so.

Textures are pvr tgas which can be opened with pvr-tools and they are in other gla archive

The meshes have a lower polycount than I anticipated.
So far I've managed to "decode" the whole mesh data (sub-materials and face index split, vertex structure, offsets, element format and dimension...), apply base transformations and hierarchy. And of course parse everything automatically.
This format is not "straight forward" at all :p

I just need to deal with some transformation inheritance issues and test it with more car models.
Not sure if I'm going to bother with textures, those might have to be applied manually. Which is fairly simple:

good work 

Meshes looks the same as Asphalt 8 I think, the good thing here is that the cars have inside view.

Good news and bad news.

Good: I've figured out how materials and textures are linked to meshes.
Bad: My PSU is broken and I have to wait for a replacement, which might take a while. But only hierarchy is left to be figured out.
