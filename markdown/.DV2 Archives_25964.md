Hello folks I have question about old .DV2 archives.
I found next :
Pointer to data
Length of filenames string
Number of files
I can't manage to find offset of packed files, any help?

Here is the file format [http://wiki.xentax.com/index.php/Larian_Studios_DV2](http://wiki.xentax.com/index.php/Larian_Studios_DV2)
And here is the script which works fine with your sample [viewtopic.php?p=44906#p44906](https://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?p=44906#p44906)

Filenames are mixed up for extracted files, but it can be hard to fix.

Thanks for reply and this incredible information.
I manage to found this : [https://prnt.sc/KcKystgi2mRo](https://prnt.sc/KcKystgi2mRo)
I'm still not sure if this is correct, how can I be sure?
How I will extract those files to .DDS if they are not starting with DDS file header?

Data on your screenshot is compressed with ZLIB.
You can always test if something is ZLIB compressed using offzip [http://aluigi.altervista.org/mytoolz/offzip.zip](http://aluigi.altervista.org/mytoolz/offzip.zip)

```
offzip.exe -a GUI.dv2
```


BUT you don't really need to do that, because I've linked you a script that can unpack data just fine:
[https://i.imgur.com/U28UFTP.png](https://i.imgur.com/U28UFTP.png)


Here's what you should do:
1. Download quickbms [http://aluigi.altervista.org/quickbms.htm](http://aluigi.altervista.org/quickbms.htm)
2. Download script that I have linked you earlier [viewtopic.php?p=44906#p44906](https://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?p=44906#p44906)
and save it as "script.bms"
3. Create some output directory, e.g. "out1"
4. Use the script on DV2 file by double clicking on quickbms.exe

Here's what it should look like:

This can be a stupid question but how that script knows what it needs to find? There is nothing which is pointing to any hex offset
I can see there is something like : GET FILES long That's probably number of the files and it goes through the loop which have sense to me, on the other hand I don't understand how "GET FILES long" is getting that number from hex.

> I don't understand how "GET FILES long" is getting that number from hex.

It's just a standard command from the documentation [http://aluigi.zenhax.com/papers/quickbms.txt](http://aluigi.zenhax.com/papers/quickbms.txt)

"GET" - it is a command to read something from hex
"FILES" - it is just a name of the output variable
"long" - it is telling your command what should be read, "long" is 4-bytes value (little endian by default)



Here is the logic explained in more details (using first file from GUI.dv2 as an example):

So clearly some of my hex data was wrong. I did everything you said and now somehow I know what I'm doing there just one more thing I don't understand.Also where is going to be end of the every file? Just add 32768 to offset and do that for every file?
It's confusing because those data is not starting with DDS but they are DDS files.
I found everything from screenshot what is my next step to save all of that data as a file, let's say I just want to save first file, can I copy that data from 8585216 to 8617984 and save it as something.dds is that possible or should I do it somehow else?
And why do I need size of the file?

Offset 8585216 stored for the first file is relative. The main difference between relative and absolute offset is that relative one is relative to "something". In your case this "something" is base offset from the header.

So you need to read in a loop 3 values: file_offset, compressed_size and uncompressed_size.
When you have those 3 values, you can do those calculations when analyzing file format:

```
REAL_FILE_END_OFFSET = REAL_FILE_START_OFFSET + COMPRESSED_FILE_SIZE    (8 621 746 for the first file in the directory)
```


When you have all this, you can also check your calculations by doing this backwards:

```
REAL_FILE_START_OFFSET = REAL_FILE_END_OFFSET - COMPRESSED_FILE_SIZE = 8 617 984
```


And those 3762 bytes (from start offset to the end offset) are your file compressed with ZLIB.
When you decompress it( e.g. with "clog" command), you will receive a 21248 bytes of uncompressed data.

> I found everything from screenshot what is my next step to save all of that data as a file, let's say I just want to save first file, can I copy that data from 8585216 to 8617984 and save it as something.dds is that possible or should I do it somehow else?

You can do this in Hex Workshop like this:
1. Open DV2 file in Hex Workshop
2. Go to file start offset
3. Select Edit > Select Block in the menu.
4. Select "Size of block"
5. Put your size in the box
6. Click "OK"
7. Press CTRL+C on your keyboard
8. Go to File > New in the menu
9. Press CTRL+V on your keyboard
10. Click "YES"
11. Click File > Save As and save your new file

And that's it. BUT REMEMBER that you are saving a ZLIB compressed block of data!.
To decompress it, you will have to use some tool like offzip.


Edit: Here's the first file as an example. Try to decompress it with offzip

So wait everything I get from .DV2 file is actually ZLIP bin file and now that .BIN file I just drop to offzip.exe?
And how I will find a file type?

Not everything - some files are compressed, some are not.

For example first file in the directory is compressed (the one that I have attached in the previous post)
but the file at offset 12107752 IS NOT compressed as you can clearly see DDS header there.

You can see some logic in the script to check if something is compressed or not (go see the difference between "log" and "clog" command in the documentation).

> And how I will find a file type?
You won't. But you can get the filename from the name list. Although the script is getting wrong filenames (which I've already mentioned earlier).


> I just drop to offzip.exe?

I've already told you how to use offzip. Use this command in the CMD window:

```
offzip.exe -a file1_example_zlib_compressed.bin
```

Great this is helpful now when I extract files edited them how I can compress them again? You said the filenames and data are mixed can that make any problems, also what I need to compress them?

Both quickbms and offzip have the same import option implemented.
See the "reimport mode" section in the documentation (section 3) [http://aluigi.altervista.org/papers/quickbms.txt](http://aluigi.altervista.org/papers/quickbms.txt)

Also try to google your answers [https://www.google.com/search?client=fi ... o+reimport](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-d&q=quickbms+how+to+reimport)

> can that make any problems
Yes, it can, but I don't have any solution for that issue now.
You would need to debug the game to see how the internal function is handling naming those files, because it is not so obvious from the looking at the archive itself.

I'm creating software in C# so I won't use quickbms, so can I just compress it by the same name in the same order like before uncompressing?

Still I have one more question  about the number 8585216 on the screenshot where did you get that? I understand that's the offset but the file header is not going there when I select 4 bytes of data pointer I'm missing something?
I found that 4 bytes right after number of files are pointing to that offset can you tell me what is that and why?
Also I tried the same thing in different file and it's not like in GUI.dv2 It's pointing me in the middle of nowhere 
My app is decompressing some files not all I need to fix that so other .DV2 can't be decompressed at least not yet until I found a solution for this
I'm getting first 9 files and the other does not seems to work I get 0bytes and When I check those files with hex editor 8617984 + 32768 That is the one file right? and I'm doing that same thing for every single file in that file GUI.dv2 I'm doing something wrong?
I understand you told me that my offset is relative on the baseOffset but  I still don't know where did you get 8585216

EDIT : I found a solution  now I can extract all .DV2 files the only problem is I'm not getting all files uncompressed some of them can't be loaded I don't understand why.
Some are 0 bytes and some are bigger size but I can't see them.

Try to add this print statement to the script:

```
print "file_num: %i%, offset: %OFFSET%, size: %SIZE%, orig_size: %origSIZE%"
```


and comment out log statements like on the screenshot below:



screenshot000203.png (30.67 KiB) Viewed 38 times



and run the script to see proper offsets and sizes.
Here are few first entries from the directory:



screenshot000204.png (29.67 KiB) Viewed 38 times



Then do the same in your code! Print your offsets and sizes in the C# code and see what is the difference.
I can't tell you what is wrong with your code. You need to figure this out.   



By the way, 8585216 is not the real offset - it is relative offset for the first entry:



screenshot000205.png (95.97 KiB) Viewed 38 times



And I've already explained how it works, so I'm not gonna repeat myself

Okay I found a problem my offset is not changing for some reason 8617984 is for the first file and for the second my app is doing this : 8617984 + 32768 but on your screenshot for the second file you got 7766016 how?

You clearly don't read directory entries correctly   
Check out the file format on the wiki and script logic once again.

For the second entry it will be:
7733248 + 32768 = 7 766 016


You need to read 7733248 offset from the directory.

[https://prnt.sc/I3b6bPKV8UBh](https://prnt.sc/I3b6bPKV8UBh) Now my offset's looks just like yours.
And now I'm getting 90% of the files which is good but still not all and I think the one I missing are not compressed I remembered there is some which are starting with DDS.

So now I can extract files but what about repacking them? I manage to get all files and compress them to ZLIB the thing is how I will write all of that data to .DV2 file what about baseOffset,fileOffset and fileHeader or should I simply use the same .dv2 file and replace the file I need?

It will be much easier to just replace data in the existing DV2 file.
Recreating whole archive may be too hard for you. It requires full knowledge of the archive format..
(how to recreate header and directory, how the padding size is calculated etc. etc.)
