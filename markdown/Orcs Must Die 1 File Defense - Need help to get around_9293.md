- Post Title: Orcs Must Die 1 File Defense - Need help to get around

Hello!
So the Orcs Must Die store most of the data in normal .zip files it can be edited easily, but when you try to start the game it says file validation failed. I tried to match the retail and the edited files crc, but it doesn't helped. I still get the validation failed. But if i use crack it works great. 
If someone has any idea, how to edit these files i welcome. If you want to try it out yourself get the dlcs too because the validation is changed in the newer version.
I can give retail exe, crack and zip files too. Please someone help to make retail zip files!

Is there anyone who checked it? I really need to mod this, or my translations will work only with the cracked games and it sucks. Please someone take a look at this!
