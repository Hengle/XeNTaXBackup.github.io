- Post Title: Wav to XVAG

hi everybody. I'm working on "a ps3 game" mod. I extracted xvag from the psarc file in the game and converted it to wav format with vgmstream.. 
I finished what I had to do but I have a problem.. I tried many methods for days, but somehow I could not convert wav files back to xvag files..
Is there a software that can batch convert wav files to xvag for ps3 games ?

You need to specify more details like:
1. What is the name of the game that XVAG files comes from?
2. What is the game version?
3. What is exact location of the files?
4. Upload some sample files on google drive, mega.nz etc.

Game name: Uncharted 2 . I want to replace the xvag files I got from the ps4 remastered version with the game on the ps3. ps3 game cannot detect the files after replacing the xvag files as they are. so I think I should convert the xvag files I extracted from the remastered version to wav files first and then back to xvag with a decoder suitable for ps3. I think the problem here is the encoder.. because when extracting with vgmstream, it says ATRAC9 encoder in ps4 files, and "playstation 4-bit ADPCM" in PS3 files. as a result if i can do a conversion between attrac9 and a playstation 4-bit ADPCM i think i can get what i want.. but i could be wrong ?
