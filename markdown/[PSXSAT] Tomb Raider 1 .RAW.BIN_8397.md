Hi, checking out the decompressed PSX files, I managed to load correctly the AMERTIT.RAW file as a 15bpp BGR, 2-dimensional file on TileMolester, so the XnView wasn't properly setup.

The Saturn version seems to be 15/16bpp, but the palette's messed up.

How did you managed to decompress this? Can you give us more information?
