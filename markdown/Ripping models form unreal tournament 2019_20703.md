- Post Title: Ripping models form unreal tournament 2019

Ive been trying to rip the skaarj player model from UT2019 But i had no luck so far, Umodel wont extract it or view it but all i can do is save the UASSET file, any help would be great and by the way these are the errors i get when trying the view or extract the model.

assertion failed: SkipOffsetH == 0

UTexture2D::Serialize4 <- UTexture2D::Serialize <- LoadObject:Texture2D'AtmosphericCloudNoise03.AtmosphericCloudNoise03', pos=423, ver=517/0 (unversioned), game=ue4.23 <- UObject::EndLoad <- CUmodelApp::ShowPackageUI <- Main:umodel_build=1021


or this

It is a strange place requesting UModel things. Anyway - UT4 is supported now:
