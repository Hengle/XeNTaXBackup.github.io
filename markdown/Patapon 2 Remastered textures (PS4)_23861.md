- Post Title: Patapon 2 Remastered textures (PS4)

Hello,
I'm having a problem with displaying textures from Patapon 2 Remastered.
It is essentially a PSP game ran on PS4's PSPHD emulator with replacing textures on the fly.

The textures are contained within texreplace.pak file with PAKF header which was easy to extract. 
The real challenge is figuring out how to convert the raw textures into their png format. I've tried using various tools to display the texture but to no avail.

In link below I provided pack of samples along with the how the original texture should look like (taken from Patapon 1 Remastered where it was in plain .png format)

*the image dimensions in the file names need to be multiplied x8, so 64 = 512

I'll be thankful for any help

I know it's been a while, but I wonder if you accomplished anything?
