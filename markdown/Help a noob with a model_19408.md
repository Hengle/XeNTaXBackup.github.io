- Post Title: Help a noob with a model

Hi! I'm a noob who wants a model but can't get it.
What I'm looking for is the model from this video [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eh-ovbA7HaA); there's the download in the description, but it comes in the shape of a mod for an android game, and I can't extract the model from it (the fact that I have a Mac and basically nothing that operate with apks runs on it doesn't really help).
So I'm asking for help from someone who knows how to work with these things. I'd love a model I can use with Maya (so I can use it for school) or at least with MMD.
Thank you in advance^^
