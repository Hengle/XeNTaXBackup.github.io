- Post Title: The Medium .PAK files

Hi guys
As you know, the newly released medium game.

And I'm going to extract game files.

Like: text and game fonts.

And I wanted you to help me as much as you can.

I wanted to tell you how you can extract files that are in .PAK files format?
Do the same pack and unpack

Thank you for your help.

Thanks. Your friend: Aria.

Looks like game on UE4 engine.
There are tools for that.

Is there no other software for this?

Because working with this software is hard and complicated and I do not think it can be used for this game

It will be good if you help me.

Thank you very much.

What do you mean by hard and complicated? Using quickbms is very easy.
To extract archive, you just need to double click on quickbms.exe, choose
your bms script, then choose archive and output path and that's it.

For reimporting  steps are similar, but you just need to run reimport.bat script.

Here is download and full documentation [https://aluigi.altervista.org/quickbms.htm](https://aluigi.altervista.org/quickbms.htm)


There is also UE4 pak unpacker

Thank you very much for your help.

I mean, since I haven't worked with this software much, I said it might be very difficult to work with.

But with this explanation, I realized that it is not that difficult to work with.

Now I have another problem, I was able to unpack one of the PCK files and now I have a file in .BAK format, how can I extract this file?

BAK is just a copy of your original PAK file.

All files should be extracted to separate folders inside game directory
after using pak unpacker.

When I want to unpack the file I want
He wants a key from me and where can I find the key to the medium game?

Do you have the key to send me?

I used this software.
But with this software, you can not extract the game text and font.

You can only see the models and textures of the game.
