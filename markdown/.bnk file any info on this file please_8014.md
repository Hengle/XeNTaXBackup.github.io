aluigi,

I did try rad tools. That player works with files  where the extension is .BIK it does not work with this bnk file as I think its a container for a wave file.  I got a hex editor open up the file and got a some info that said BKHD DIDX DATA RIFX.BSÇWAVEfmt k9yÂ..data.BSq.  i got that info im just not sure what it means, do you?

It's WWise bank file with big endian byte order and RIFX files in it (from xbox360, probably). Use this bms script to unpack such files. But in file you provided there is only one truncated RIFX file, so the real audio data is somewhere else.

```
IDString "BKHD"
Get SECTION_SIZE long
If SECTION_SIZE > 0xFFFF
 ReverseLong SECTION_SIZE
 Endian BIG
EndIf
GoTo SECTION_SIZE 0 SEEK_CUR
Get BNK_SIZE asize

Do
 GetDString SECTION_NAME 4
 Get SECTION_SIZE long
 If SECTION_NAME == "DIDX"
  SavePos DIDX_OFFSET
  Math FILES = SECTION_SIZE
  Math FILES /= 12
 ElseIf SECTION_NAME == "DATA"
  SavePos DATA_OFFSET
 EndIf
 GoTo SECTION_SIZE 0 SEEK_CUR
 SavePos POS
While POS < BNK_SIZE

GoTo DIDX_OFFSET
For I = 0 < FILES
 Get FID long
 Get FOFFSET long
 Get FSIZE long
 String FNAME p= "%08X.wav" FID
 Math FOFFSET += DATA_OFFSET
 Log FNAME FOFFSET FSIZE
Next I
```

Whoa, whoa. Are you telling there is no sound in that file? 

Can I tell you how i found that file.
The file is from a wii game. (zumba fitness 2)


I opened the game with wii scrubber
+partition1 
+ audio
+soundbanks  some .bnks files 
+songs ( all the songs are in that .bnk format song 1-44 just like the sample I put up. 
+stream (.wem files with a long number. that iam sure are related to the .BNK files.

hopes this makes sense
tnx for the help btw.

When you unpacked Song_027.bnk you've got the file with ID 06397D77 (06397D77.wav, which isn't wav actually).
06397D77 in hex is equal to 104430967 in dec, so the file 104430967.wem contain actual audio stream for file with ID 06397D77. I've seen this before in other games that uses WWise sound engine. Bad news is that I have no idea how to decode 104430967.wem, as I don't know what compression formats usually used in Wii games and what tools needed to decode them. 
Just may say it's RIFX with big endian byte order and unknown compression - wFormatTag=0xFFFF.

tnx for the big help.  can you give  me something to research, to help the cause. should I find out what compression formats are used in wii?

thinking outloud here. tell me if iam wrong
The audio is not in wave format.
the audio is compressed and don't know with what and we don't know what type of audio format the files are in. hmm

should I look into that Bnk file or is it the .wem file that I want open?

There several topics on this forum related to wwise. Search for "wwise" and "rifx" and try tools and scripts given in that topics.
