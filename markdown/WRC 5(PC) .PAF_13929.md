- Post Title: WRC 5(PC) .PAF

So I came across a PC game(WRC 5) that uses these .PAF audio files. As I saw these files through the hex editor, they were actually some kind of FSB containers.

Here are all the .PAF files(I couldn't be bothered to upload just one since I just uninstalled the whole game while keeping these files on my HDD):

Thanks.

Just cut 0x46 bytes or use [fsb5 dumper](http://zenhax.com/viewtopic.php?p=6506#p6506) to get valid fsb file.
