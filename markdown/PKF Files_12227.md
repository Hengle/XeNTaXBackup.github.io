- Post Title: PKF Files

Hey,

I'm trying to extract one of the Karaoke Revolution titles for PS2, and I notice the game uses .pkf archives...

CAMERA.PKF
CHARA.PKF
STAGE.PKF

and then there's TITLE.DAT

If I open it up in a hex editor, I see some stuff starting with this

```
PKFs ... .......................CHARA001.PKF........¸....À].....CHARA002.PKF....¹...É....Hf.....CHARA003.PKF....‚...@.....b.....CHARA004.PKF....Â$..I....Hb.....CHARA005.PKF.....1.......À`.....CHARA006.PKF....#=..É....Hf.....CHARA007.PKF....ìI..g....8c.....CHARA008.PKF....SV..I....Hb.....CHARA009.PKF....œb..ã....._.....CHARA010.PKF.....n.......hh.....CHARA011.PKF....Œ{..3....˜Y.....CHARA012.PKF....¿†..ç....8g.....
```


It seems to repeat itself again too.

So it's a bunch of PKF files inside a PKF file?  I'm confused.  The files are pretty small, too... like 70MB or so.  But I'd like some help extracting them.
