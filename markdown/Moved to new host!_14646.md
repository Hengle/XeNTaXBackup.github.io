Thank you, zips and rars are downloadable again and are not corrupt on extraction   
but i guess there is no hope for restoring broken or corrupt image attachments though

I had an issue yesterday, logging in on my mobile phone. It's like the cookies were not being set correctly as, when I logged in I got the success message. But returning to the forum showed me as logged out. I fixed this by checking the log in automatically box.

Not sure if this is still happening though.

Pages seem to respond much quicker 

Having every other page return this message though:

yeah, I feel it's quicker.
Good job, Mr.Mouse, to join a new hoster!

But as WRS said, sometimes "Resource Limit Is Reached" pops up.

Not a big deal atm, reloading the page does the trick.

Thanks for pointing that out. It the limit message a forum message ? Or is it a host message? Can someone make a screenshot once it happens ?

As a side note, can we get either an option to export all the shit in our inbox to a flat file to archive, or bump the limit way above 200? I have to look through to delete shit every time I get a new message, cause I like to keep old messages around for reference, particularly ones that actually have some useful info in them or ones that I intend to reply to one of these months after doing whatever thing they're requesting that I deemed reasonable. So then I have to actually read the messages I'm about to delete again and save them locally before deleting if they have useful content. And because I'm lazy, the net result is that I only read my PM's once every 3 months.
