- Post Title: [SMD] - Elemental Master tool extract/dump text

Hello friends, I do not know if this is the best place for this topic, if not apologize moderation. 
I am looking to translate the game Elemental Master Sega Genesis, but this game uses LZ compression, as I am no friend of programming I'm unsure how to create a tool for this game. 
Some of the friends could create a tool to extract the text and images of this game for a translation? 
I leave the link in the game to analyze. 

Thank you.
