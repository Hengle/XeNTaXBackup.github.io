Hello,

I want to translate some adventure games made with Adventure Game Studio ([http://www.adventuregamestudio.co.uk](http://www.adventuregamestudio.co.uk)).

Is it possible to extract files somehow, translate them and then repack them?

Thank you very much for your help...

There is a new game:
Al Emmo and the Lost Dutchman's Mine
Use AGS develop by Himalaya Studios.
there are many Al_Emmo.XXX files(head is clib).
Please help unpack/pack this type files.
I want to localize this game.
Here is example:

And here you can download this game:
