- Post Title: Northgard UI scaling

Hello everybody Im having some trouble with the UI of the game Northgard.

My friends and I have bought Northgard (YES in 2020) and got really hooked BUT, the UI its a bit messy on any resolution below 1600x900.
In the options menu you have a few options for UI Scaling (1x  1.2x  1.5x) that works "ok" when you play at avarage resolutions but we need something more...

I know I know, Northgard its pretty cheap on requirements but there's people out there, like me or my friends, that really have to play the game on low res to get some nice fps.

If someone can shed some light on this topic we would really appreciate.
