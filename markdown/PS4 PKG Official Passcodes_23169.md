Does anyone here know where I could find the Official Passcodes to Official PS4 PKG games for file content viewing?

Maybe on some PS4 forums or you can get them directly from developers?

Impossible, unless someone leaks said passcode for a specific PS4 PKG game, (example of leaks: FF7R, KHIII, etc) otherwise everything happens internally in the PS4, there's no way to currently decrypt a Retail PKG using a computer with out a leaked passcode, time will tell if that will even surface, maybe once the PS4 will be discontinued, who knows.
