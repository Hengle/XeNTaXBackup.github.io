Hi mate,

It looks like an archive, but doesn't really let me do much with it. There is probably a separate directory file or something like that.

In the same directory as the archive, is there any other small files (<100kb) with the same name. For example, if the archive is called myArc.naz, look for files called myArc.dir , myArc.toc , myArc.fat , or anything else. If you find one, can you post it here please.

Otherwise, could you please do a bigger cut of the archives and attach it here instead - you chose 100kb cut size which is just too small to work with in this case - try something like 1MB.

Thanks - if you have trouble posting the files here because they are too large, you can email them to us.

Hi mate,

Same comment as before - there are sounds and stuff in there, but I can't find the directory.

You can probably get some of the sounds out of there if you use an OGG sound ripper - I don't know if there are any special OGG rippers out there, but Game Extractor (Full) will hopefully drag them out if you need them (using the Format Scanner)

Hi I am looking to rip the main theme song from the game Total Overdose the one that plays in the main menu when you load up the game. I tried opening up the .NAZ files with Game Extractor (works beautifully) and I played all of the OGG files but none of those are the main theme song. Does anyone know where in the game's files this song is stored? I tried the Blocks.naz file but that didnt show anything audio I think that's the game code or something. Any help would be appreciated  and Thanks again.

Localisation files of the game are encrypted, so edit these files is impossible while someone not make a decryption.
