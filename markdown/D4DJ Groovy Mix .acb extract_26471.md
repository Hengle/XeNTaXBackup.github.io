i played with .acb in foobar200 and it sounds so weird
how do I solve it?, with hca_keys.h?

It works fine for me. Maybe try newer version of foobar and vgmstream plugin.

My versions:
foobar2000 --> v1.6.10
vgmstream plugin --> r1810

Here is download for this version of the plugin [https://github.com/vgmstream/vgmstream/ ... /tag/r1810](https://github.com/vgmstream/vgmstream/releases/tag/r1810)

I have also had no success unpacking the D4DJ files. I tried the solution of updating the plugins and Foobar2000, but I keep getting annoying sounds instead of what I should.

I tried creating a .hcakey with a key I found on GitHub and that doesn't work either.

Does anyone know anything else about it?
