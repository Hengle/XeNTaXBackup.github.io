Don't run out and shut down Norton, but I don't trust anything they say. They have aluigi's web page mark a dangerous and I have had stuff I've written on the same PC in VC++ get marked. I know that it doesn't have a virus, cause I didn't put one in it. JauderNub(sp) is marked as well. Anything that "Sniffs" raw bytes usually gets hammered pretty good. I have stopped using Norton all together, due to the grinding halt of development it creates. Plus watch what happens when your out of town and your subscription lapses. Bang No more firewall and free rain on your PC from anywhere that can be thought of. WOW that's protection if you ask me 


Try AVG and MBAM(Malware bytes) they are pretty much spot on. If other scanners don't find it, it probably don't exist. You can also do a search on the filename in google. it usually will report a virus if it is actually there. 

Like I said don't go shutting Norton down and running without anything but be aware that they are the Antichrist of developers.

True. Jaeder Naub is also in the MultiEx Commander package and Microsoft Security, Norton etc usually block it. What you should do is check the type of analysis the AV program used, they usually say that in the details. If it is some kind of heuristic or "automated" analysis it is 99% baseless conjecture. Just because a programs sniffs around like a mediascanner, doesn't mean it is evil. Quite the opposite, Jaeder Naub will find music and sounds and graphics for you from otherwise hidden depths of archives. It doesn't install or corrupt anything.

EDIT: sorry for usless post. I simply (temporarily) disconnected from the internet, shut down norton (antivirus/firewall) installed MultiEX without issue and reversed the procedure. Sorry.   

I too keep getting the false "java version is not at the proper level" But I saw the other thread explaining it's false and is not needed, so I just ignore it.
