hi,
this file from original release of the game. there is 2 different header for files.
resources\Localized\Audio\English.dsPack file: 
```
2066676D5A5A0108 :  fgmZZ..
```

other files in resources\ has 
```
6D67662008015A5A : mgf ..ZZ
```
 . there is I think there is only little endian and big endian difference.
and example file:
[DOWNLOAD sample preload.dsPack file](http://www.mediafire.com/?hdpz3bbht1h8tfl)

I can't believe no one has managed to create an extractor for the game. I checked out english.dspack and found the file listing at offset 0x2506D6. The archive contains over 2000 uncompressed mp3-files with wave headers (160kbps, mono, 48khz). The same goes for audio.dspack. I extracted one file manually with a hex editor and it plays fine. 

I checked out resource.dspack and that one seems to be compressed. The end of the file seems to contain the dictionary, at least the many word fragments I found give me the impression. I'm not knowledgeable enough to identify the compression algorithm, but may be someone can take it from here and finally decipher these files.

Funny that no one seems to be able to extract the uncompressed archives. Well, I wrote my own extractor in the meantime so never mind.

some time ago I wrote a work-in-progress script for extracting the uncompressed files from F3AR so I have just replaced the clog command with a log one (after all if I don't know the algorithm I can do nothing so extract them compressed) for allowing it to work:

I tried both of your Fear 3 scripts on the retail version and not a single one extracts. On audio.dspack the extraction of crc.map errors out with the following message:

"Error: the specific offset can't be reached"

Since the audio-archives are not compressed, there's not much to figure out. I already have the files extracted with generic filenames. Now all I need to do is to read the names and directory structure from the archive.

Maybe bugmenotty would like to share his source since it works?

If you read, he extracted the audio files. (uncompressed ones) any wave/mp3 scanner does that just fine.

Didn't read his second post. thought he meant it was easy and was surprised that no one has figured it out.

I have seen no threads related to this argument on encode.ru.
anyway I have doubts about someone there who would like to spend time on this algorithm without even having a precompiled code to check (game + exact location of the algorithm)

about the nickname banning I don't know the policy here but I understand the frustration of being obligated to register anywhere (forums and bug trackers) only to say one thing.

Do you still need these? I successfully extracted them with a program I found called "Game Extractor".
