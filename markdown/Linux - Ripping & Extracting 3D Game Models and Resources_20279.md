- Post Title: Linux - Ripping & Extracting 3D Game Models and Resources

[](https://steamcommunity.com/games/221410/announcements/detail/1696055855739350561)[](https://lutris.net/)[](https://www.playonlinux.com/)[](https://www.winehq.org/)

Not too long ago, Valve released its [Steam Play](https://steamcommunity.com/games/221410/announcements/detail/1696055855739350561) service which allows Steam users to play Windows games on Linux.
Because of this and the upcoming end of Windows 7 support, there has been a noticeable growth of Linux users.

At the time of this post, there appears to be 2 Linux distributions that are attracting gamer eyeballs:
Manjaro and Pop!_OS

All of this is relatively new, so there will be questions.
Can we expect to rip and extract game resources in a similar way to Windows?
What challenges can we expect?
Will WINE, PlayOnLinux, or Virtual Machine be necessary?
What are some recommended native Linux tools/programs?

Tools for Linux
QuickBMS
- Universal script based files extractor and reimporter.
- Supports tons of games and file formats, archives, encryptions, compressions, obfuscations and other algorithms.
- Uses a minimalistic GUI if the executable is double-clicked (launched normally) or from command-line if launched from the console, by using this second mode or a link to the executable it's possible to activate many useful and advanced options.
- [Linux Mirror 1] [Linux Mirror 2]

UModel
- Unreal Engine Resource Viewer also known as Umodel or Unreal Model Viewer is program for viewing and extracting resources from various games made with Unreal Engine.
- Linux version has no GUI yet, you should use command line to start UModel.
- [Download] [GitHub]

I'm hoping this topic will aggregate all the essential resources needed to help Linux users rip and extract game resources.
If you know more or have some experience in this area, please share below.

I'm still looking for more tools. 
I updated the OP with tools I've come across.
