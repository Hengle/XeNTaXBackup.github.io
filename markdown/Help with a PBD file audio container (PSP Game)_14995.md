- Post Title: Help with a PBD file audio container (PSP Game)

hi i need help for a voice mod what i'm trying to do for Saint Seiya Omega for PSP. When i was searching the audio files, i found the fighting react sounds into a .PBD file (Sound.PBD). I can decode this file thanks to PSound, but i don't know how i can build a PBD file injecting new sound files. Please help me with this trouble. Thanks in advance.

Sample here (PBD and PHD files): [https://www.mediafire.com/file/vym93mac ... D.rar/file](https://www.mediafire.com/file/vym93mac0qzto1j/Seiya_audio_file_PBD_PHD.rar/file)
