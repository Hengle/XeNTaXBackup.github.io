The game reads some texts from the easily editable .INT files, but those, which appear under intros, movies are in some of the .UPK files. Now there was a program here >> [viewtopic.php?p=78609#p78609](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?p=78609#p78609), which can extract the texts from those UPKs (after decompressing them with Gildor's decompress.exe), but apparently doesn't repack them.
Any ideas?

Here something you can try to edit text in loc_int.upk files.
I attach a great tool by japanese, because looks like their hompage is not available anymore.
Use it to unpack an upk.
Then use this to export import text: [http://www.sendspace.com/file/unbc4g](http://www.sendspace.com/file/unbc4g) (updated)
Then repack the upk.
