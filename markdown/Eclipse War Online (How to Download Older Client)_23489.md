- Post Title: Eclipse War Online (How to Download Older Client)

hello guys, people help for the benefit of the people who own the client of the game Eclipse War Online or who know some site that can download old game client that can make the download or site available.

In the past I used to download clients on gamershell, but this one doesn't exist anymore. I found this other site:
[https://ds-servers.com/gf/eclipse-war-online/clients/](https://ds-servers.com/gf/eclipse-war-online/clients/)

But for some reason the download never ends, I don't know if their server error or if the file is corrupted. I ask for help for everyone.

Thank you very much in advance.

the direct link, changes according to the ip because the file is hosted on a cdn, it would have access through the site.
