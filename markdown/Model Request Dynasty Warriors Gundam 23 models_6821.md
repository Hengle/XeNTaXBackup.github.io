Sir chrrox can you help me get the models from this game? since I saw that you were working on this in this thread [http://gameresearch.5d6d.com/archiver/t ... age-1.html](http://gameresearch.5d6d.com/archiver/tid-209-page-1.html)
were you able to get the models? if so, is it the same for dynasty warriors gundam 3? because I think the models in gundam 3 are better than in gundam 2 so it would be better ..

I'm still looking for more details on this too. I can't find a single decent article on how to actually get these models... I'm just praying chrrox comes out of the woodwork with some information, but he's such a busy guy, who knows If we'll ever get these models...

agreed. I related it to a friend tonight. we're just artists, we aren't programmers. As such, we don't deserve his support in this, however just giving us the blueprint for the data format is like handing us a book in japanese and saying read this. it would take us months, if not years to learn japanese... they already know japanese! it would take them like 2 days to read it! please, just have a heart, ya know!? hahaha, oh well, maybe one day...
