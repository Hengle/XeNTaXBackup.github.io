Hello everyone, I am currently modifying the game [Xin Jian 2](http://jx2.xoyo.com/). I have exported some file is: .mesh .mtl and .tga
I have tried google to find out about KSword3D and get the link of the forum [viewtopic.php?f=16&t=8325](https://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=8325)
Hope everyone can help me understand the files I exported

I have tried google to find out about KSword3DDon't speak in riddles. How did you export them?
This is the contents of 143.mesh, afaics (normals usually build a sphere, so dunno):

(btw: there's one or two QNANs (not a number) when converting the hex data, so manual correction is required)

I don't have much time. Ask your specific questions and I'll try to answer them.

As always it's required that you get some basic understanding of 3D formats (see/read links in my sig).

I have read it, but still don't quite understand, can you make a video or tutorial for my .mesh file? If I have finished editing the .mesh or .obj file, how can I export it back to its original format? thank you very much for your support

I just want to know how to edit this .mesh file, for example here is the Christmas tree, edit it to become another tree and put it back into the game

How did you edit the .mesh? In case you didn't change the vertex count there's  no reason why the game shouldn't accept the modified .mesh.

(You didn't answer my question, how you got the unchanged .mesh file. Is it directly from a game folder/archive file or is it "exported"?
If "exported" then with which tool? What was the input file then?)

You need to realize that an obj_to_some3DFormat converter is very time consuming to create. It's not that simple as you might think of.

Converting some3DFormat to obj usually takes 15 minutes (first submesh only) for simple formats.
That's probably the reason why some guys believe the vice versa way is similar. But it is not.

You'd better answer my questions than waiting for a "video tutorial" - I don't have the time for such, sorry.
