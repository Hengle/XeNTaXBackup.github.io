- Post Title: Family Guy PSP .r4s / .r4m archives

Hello. Do someone have any experience with .r4s / .r4m archives from "Family Guy" game on PSP?

I have made some initial research [https://github.com/bartlomiejduda/Tools ... 0Guy%20PSP](https://github.com/bartlomiejduda/Tools/tree/master/NEW%20Tools/Family%20Guy%20PSP)

And here are the samples [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PQkFHT ... sp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PQkFHT3CaGoJBRXI6g50vMUOkj9_t_Vu/view?usp=sharing)

Take a look into 10_00.r4s and 10_00.r4m archives. They contain some WAV file
which can be played in VLC media player (at least some of them).
Any help in reversing would be great here.
