- Post Title: Need Help Extracting Halo 2 Vista Sounds

I know you can extract sound files from the games maps with Gravemind, But that takes an extremely long time, as you can only export one at a time, and it takes a little to re-direct the export path each time. (I know it sounds like a small problem, and it kind of is lol.) I'm just asking if there is an easier way. Halo 2 Sound Tools has dissapeared, and every link's rar file is corrupted. Any help? Thanks in advance. -Blaze
