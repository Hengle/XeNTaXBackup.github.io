- Post Title: L4D2 Models

I extracted the L4D2 ZIP archive (Xbox 360) and now I need to figure out how to open these models. I attached a folder that was inside the models folder. I'm not the best at model stuff so can anyone help?

if you look in the half life garrys mod... you will find alsorts of models have been ported... its simply a matter of converting them to what ever you want from there.
