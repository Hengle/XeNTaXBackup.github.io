I am noob in field of 3d model research.
i want to extract 3d models from 5dx avengers civil war apk. 
after little research i think there is no tool to convert these sharedassets.assets.split files into common 3d formats like obj 
if any one any can handle to extract them otherwise provide any plugin or script to convert them because theese 3d models means alot for me me beacuse i am in worst condition after endgame.
any suggestions or help will be most appreciated

try [https://github.com/Perfare/AssetStudio](https://github.com/Perfare/AssetStudio) and open the whole folder. AS usually combines those split files into full files and is able to open the whole thing. depends on the file's hierarchy and your choice if you wanna extract from the scene or the asset list.
