- Post Title: Three classic titles... Veil of Darkness, The Legacy, SotC.

A considerable while ago - in DOS 6.0  - I tried extracting data from those three games and converting it to some usable format - music, graphics and, in case of "Shadow", even text, as it's encrypted. I did not.  I wonder if since then any information about the formats that they used leaked from Microprose, SSI and Infogrames, or the games' developers...?

The games:

Veil of Darkness:

The Summoning, which seems to use the same engine:
[http://www.the-underdogs.org/game.php?id=1087](http://www.the-underdogs.org/game.php?id=1087)

The Legacy:

Unfortunately, it isn't very common for game developers to release this type of information - even if the game it really old  . Thats why we do what we do.

We will look into these games soon for you, and see if we can work out anything. I can't say too much at the moment, but not many dos-based games are very readable so there is a chance we can't do anything, but we'll see.

Here's hoping.
