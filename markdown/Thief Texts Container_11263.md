For localization you must edit this file: "DefaultStringAsset.dat"
Sadly, it has character limitation. But, it's unicode.

note : if you import all string assets from all .upk files like (SwtGlobal_UI,GFxUI,Swt_Maps_666) in DefaultStringAsset.dat the game will override them and load all files from DefaultStringAsset.dat

DefaultStringAsset.dat  is a files container, it contains two files in default (SwtGlobal_UI,GFxUI)

but you can find other string assets files in all .upk files of theif game like this file (Swt_Maps_666)

you have to extract all string assets files from all .upk files and import it in DefaultStringAsset.dat (my tool doesn't support that)

then the game will override other string assets and read all strings from DefaultStringAsset.dat so you don't have to repack .upk files

OK... But you didnt answered that what is most important thing in this forum: HOW? WHICH TOOLS?
Step by step guide...

You did lot of efforts with your tool --- which's great but generating string mess up at first start of the game, and the user must have change bindly the language option forth and back to see translated strings... --- but with that kind of answer of yours we didn't get any help
