- Post Title: AMF Bowling 2004 *.MSH

Going to quote what I wrote on Discord:
 This format for finding UVs has been driving me nuts for two days. This .msh is from AMF Bowling 2004 for the XBOX, and I was wondering if you could help me locate these damn UVs. Attached in the .7z is the original msh file, original and png converted versions of the .tex files through texturefinder (They are RGBA8888, width value stored at 0x0 uint32, and height stored at 0x4 uint32)., vertex and face settings for ModelResearcher, as well as a noted txt layout of the format. If you could, or someone else could take a moment to look at this to help me find UVs, it would be appreciated! 

(Will give more samples as necessary )
