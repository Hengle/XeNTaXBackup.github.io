- Post Title: Jericho encrypted files...

Hi there,
First time on the forum.
I'm particularly interested in decrypting the wav files from Jericho for a project I'm working on, also the tga's and dds's would be nice. (I'm asuming they are encrypted, correct me if I'm wrong.)
So if anyone has any experience getting these files to work, I would really appreciate your help.
Thanx.

(btw, I'm a total noob at coding, I'm more into graphics/sound design.)
