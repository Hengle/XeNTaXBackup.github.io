I am 100% sure it is a 3D model. Should be a modified ogre model!

MSH is likely short for MESH which... yeah is a 3D model.

Ya, at first i thought that.
But after using alot of programs i could not get into it.
Then i felt from the hex  looked like a standard 24-bit bitmap with a different header.


Anyone know the appropriate program to open this mesh file?

I mean i have used many programs that open .msh(mesh) files, they open them but not the set of msh files i am trying to open. Thats why i was leading to believe the file is something more.
