I'm trying to get the textures from the .tex files of Nicktoons MLB on Wii. I can't find anything that will extract them, so maybe you guys can help me out?

This is what I found out about the *.tex file format:

Then I decompressed the zlib compressed chunks.
(I'll attach the files in my next post, because the forum doesn't allow me to add another attachment!)

Ok, here are some decompressed files. Maybe someone else can find out how to "unswizzle" them.

apparently this game uses an extremely similar format to dead rising 2, the file structure is exactly the same.
