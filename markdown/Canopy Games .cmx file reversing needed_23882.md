One sub mesh (of 13), no higher lods expected.

are assumed to start at 0x191c5, don't have the time to find suiting face indices:

There's strings in the file, 13 x "VertexLoc", 13 x "VertexTexCoordsPass1Stage1" and 31 assumed starts of face indices blocks (000000000100000002000000).
So you need to fiddle out for yourself which FI block belongs to which vertex or uv block.
