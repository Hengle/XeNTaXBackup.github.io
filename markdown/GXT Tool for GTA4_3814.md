- Post Title: GXT Tool for GTA4

Can anyone get me tool which works with GTA4 gxt files, exports tables and imports correctly for GTA IV

there are many infos about this file format and source codes, may be someone will help me, I'm translating this game.

There are many tools which correctly works with San Andreas serie. I think everyone knows forums and sites with gta tools and moodin things but no one provide working gxt editor for gta4 gxt language file.

can post all things i have collected from Russian and other resources.

plz plz plz help. I need tool, someone, what I can
Here is ALL tools I've found [http://www.sendspace.com/file/u8auf2](http://www.sendspace.com/file/u8auf2)
Here is wiki for gta (here GXT for GTA4) [link](http://www.gtamodding.com/index.php?title=GXT)

my text in gxt gets so:
my language writes in Unicode, but i've tool which changes that symbols into russian alphabets, for exmp.
In Windows Symbols' Table, in font Sylfaen you will find alphabet, which has code U+10D0: Georgian Letter An
Here is Image

So this letters I'm changing into russians, like: 10D0 = russian Ð¤ (U+10D0: Cyrillic Capital Letter Ef)

So I need tool to just export text tables and import in American.gxt file, but which would be tested, coz some SA GXT tools do that but doesn't work, some work but doesn't have table export import.

Also there is GTA4 GXT Viewer with delphi source code and may be someone can advance it to support data exporting/importing
it's included into GTX_TOOLS.rar

Thanks everyone who has red this
