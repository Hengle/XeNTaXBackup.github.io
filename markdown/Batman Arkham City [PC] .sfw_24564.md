- Post Title: Batman Arkham City [PC] .sfw

Hey guys
I wanna mod some .gfx files actually for Arkham City PC. I'm looking to replace the X360 button icons with the PS3 button icons.
There's this file called FrontMostLayer.gfx (signature = CFX), which is one of many I'll have to edit.
It has different hex code in Hex Editor and JPEXS. How is this possible?

Opened in Hex Neo:

Opened in JPEXS:

The hex editor shows the correct code the game accepts. 
Obviously I can't put in the JPEXS code because if I do the game crashes.
I can't use hex edit the file to make my mod because it's impossible for me

Here's the [file](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1JKDomm9B7_GPZPDpWR2ifnD2Eq1Q0sy_?usp=sharing).

Any help is greatly appreciated.
