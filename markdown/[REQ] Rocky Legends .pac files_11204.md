- Post Title: [REQ] Rocky Legends .pac files

Rocky Legends is a 2004 Ubisoft game based off of the Rocky films and I enjoy it very much and just recently binged the films again and was wondering if it was possible to extract the models. 

The data was stored in a 2GB MFS archive, which was extractable via a GameExtractor plugin. (Ancient tech, man.)

Included are .pac files, which in most games are archives, but here they seemingly aren't. Also included are .ske, which may be skeletal data.

I didn't include textures because they're TM2, easily convertable.

yes , the pac files are 3d models in little endian, I can figure vertex with size 48 in hex2obj but I can't find Ã­ndices, maybe are mixed between the vertex
