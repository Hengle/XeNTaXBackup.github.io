this is the "Game Archive" forum so the chances of getting an help for a 3d format are very low if not just zero (for example my capabilities are the extraction of files from archives, I know nothing about 3d/graphic/audio).

in short, your thread is off-topic here.
while it's ok for "3D/2D models" in which there are more chances of a reply (that does NOT mean you will receive a solution for sure)
