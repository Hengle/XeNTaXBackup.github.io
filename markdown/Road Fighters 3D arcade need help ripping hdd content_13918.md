Hey Guys, I got bored of not being able to play my Road Fighters 3D arcade game machine online.

So, i'm in the process of converting it into a dedicated Assetto Corsa arcade machine, using a spare PC and its awesome.

But , I will miss a couple of the tracks that i really liked on RF3D and would luv to get them converted to play on AC.
I know its not as good as having a Wangan Midnight Maximum Tune 5 , but if i can get these extracted i will try and get WMMT5 next.

Is there anyway i can rip the content on the hdd so we can make this a reality, the machine has 2 usb Keys and the motherboard looks like a normal pc with a few extras. I had a look around the forums, but i'm a bit confused with what i can use to rip the hdd content and don't want to brick it or something.

At boot up, its running on an embeded windows xp, then goes into some custom software to load the rom before game start, dosen't look DOS based.

Hers a couple of videos of the game in action :

If anybody can point me in the right direction of what i need hardware or software wise that would be a great start. Cheers

Hi everyone, anyone knows how to open .wdp files from this game, looks like image file, (hope this be a 3d file) but this can't be opened with any app

I like find the tracks, but the game are divided in many folders containing little files, just like Enthusia Professional Racing
