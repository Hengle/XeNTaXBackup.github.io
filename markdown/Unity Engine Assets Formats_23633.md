- Post Title: Unity Engine Assets Formats

awhile ago Daz had a sale on the Unity prototyping Game Assets. Is there anything that takes the .unitypackage or unity .prefab and converts it to FBX?

I've check Noesis (google search), but couldn't find if it supported it through a plugin or if there was a trusted plugin?

Why not just use unity?
Import them into unity and it 'unzips' the package, from there it's probably already a bunch of fbx files, and if its not unity can just export them.

Unity has a tendency to strip information out and it's an engine, which means installing the whole thing. Just that I'm using UE4 and wanted to not install another engine.
