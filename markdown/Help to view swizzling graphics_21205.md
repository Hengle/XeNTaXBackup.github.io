- Post Title: Help to view swizzling graphics

Hi guys, I've heard about a script written in python to the Noesis tool that allows to view and export the NFS MW textures of Xbox 360 version. This version uses swizzling graphics and the PS2 version uses the swizzling too.
So, there is a way to adapt the script to the NFS MW textures of PS2 version?
This is the link with the script [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-OHjOg ... p=drivesdk](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-OHjOgwpzYLGKGFMobiKdwUU4g4RCC3W/view?usp=drivesdk).             

and this is the link with a texture sample of the game

Afaik there was/is a ton modding tools for the pc version of this. You talking the 2005 MW game, right? As a PC gamer you should not mess with those console game files. There's no point. Just google search the tools for the PC version and play on it.

Hi, I am not a pc gamer, my pc is too simple and don't run it the pc version of the game. My goal with the textures is edit some textures to upgrade my translation made in the console version, is all for translation purposes.

i'll not hop in there. as far as i can tell it uses lz compression to pack the bin files. this makes any reimport using for example quickbms unreliable. the size of edited textures after recompression will vary. i don't think this will work.

the texture format doesn't seem to be too complex. it uses a 'footer' description. on the larger files the footer is missing tho. that's one more thing why i decline to work on this. just play it in english or whatever language you have available there. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

Hi, I have found this font texture [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-OHw1x ... p=drivesdk](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-OHw1xHgU52a8u7O5ehOhqJTVg_fEg9h/view?usp=drivesdk) .
This font don't uses compression and this file is located in a simple archive without compression too, so is easy reimport it to the game, the texture is wizzled too, but I can view it almost perfectly, this picture show my progress trying to view it to export/edit/import [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-RkQX3 ... p=drivesdk](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-RkQX365rZwOqJsNfndmI4emnfxFCYHS/view?usp=drivesdk)
I think that is more easy edit this texture, cause I can view a lot of details in comparison with the others that it seems more complicated.
So can you help me to view and edit/import this font file, if I can do this, already a big progress to edit the others textures
