- Post Title: .TEX file editing for Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles.

Hello. So i need some help here.

I've been wanting to do gamecube texture mods for a while, and although i have done it on Dolphin with success, i want to try it with an actual ISO.

So the game in question here is Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles, but the problem is that the textures are in .tex files. I tried looking for a .tex editor but all i got were text editors.

A few folks over at the Dolphin-Emu forums suggested i come here for help, which would be much appreciated.
