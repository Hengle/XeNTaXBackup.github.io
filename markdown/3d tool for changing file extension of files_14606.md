You're not providing enough information on what you are trying to do.

Are you trying to:

A. Create a tool that can rename the file extension with a 3D gui.

or

B. Create a tool that can rename file extensions for 3D related file formats.

or

C. Create a 3D Model/Skeletal/Animation viewer tool which can change the file extensions.

or 

D. Create a 3D Model/Skeletal/Animation viewer tool which can export to different formats.

I'm rather confused by your post, but please clear up what you are wanting to do. I've also moved this thread to the Code Talk sub-forum since you're asking how to make a tool.
