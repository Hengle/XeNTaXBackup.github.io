- Post Title: RIFX ADPCM format (Arkham City, Grease Dance etc.)

Can anyone take a look at the new RIFX ADPCM format that newer games use? I don't know how complicated it is to process but I've heard that many ADPCM formats are very similar.
Here are some examples from Grease Dance for Xbox 360: [http://www.gamefront.com/files/20933572 ... ce_rifx.7z](http://www.gamefront.com/files/20933572/Grease_Dance_rifx.7z)

Thanks for your help!
