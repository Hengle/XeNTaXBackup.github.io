If there are any noesis plugin scripters here, could you please explain the logic of the piece of code/ api call
rapi.rpgCommitTriangles ?

My friend @plodtrew is trying to code an application to manipulate WWE RAW 2 .fml files.

Certainly, "rapi.rpgCommitTriangles" is an API call commonly used in game development, particularly for rendering 3D graphics. It's often part of a game engine's rendering pipeline, used to draw triangles or other geometric shapes on the screen. In this context, it's a fundamental function for creating graphics in a game like WWE RAW 2. Your friend may be using it to render 3D elements or perform other graphics-related tasks in their application.

Not really being a "Noesis scripter" but whatever answer is expected; hints are to be found in Noesis' \source\pluginshare.h:

	void				(*rpgCommitTriangles)(void *idxData, rpgeoDataType_e dataType, int numIdx, rpgeoPrimType_e primType, bool usePlotMap);

```
{
	RPGEODATA_FLOAT = 0,
	RPGEODATA_INT,
	RPGEODATA_UINT,
	RPGEODATA_SHORT,
	RPGEODATA_USHORT,
	RPGEODATA_HALFFLOAT,
	RPGEODATA_DOUBLE,
	RPGEODATA_BYTE,
	RPGEODATA_UBYTE,
	NUM_RPGEO_DATATYPES
} rpgeoDataType_e;

typedef enum
{
	RPGEO_NONE = 0,
	RPGEO_POINTS,
	RPGEO_TRIANGLE,
	RPGEO_TRIANGLE_STRIP,
	RPGEO_QUAD, //ABC_DCB
	RPGEO_POLYGON,
	RPGEO_TRIANGLE_FAN,
	RPGEO_QUAD_STRIP,
	RPGEO_TRIANGLE_STRIP_FLIPPED,
	RPGEO_QUAD_ABC_BCD,
	RPGEO_QUAD_ABC_ACD,
	RPGEO_QUAD_ABC_DCA,
	NUM_RPGEO_TYPES
} rpgeoPrimType_e;
```


*idxData is a pointer to the face index data (buffer), afair. Surprise. 

Most common "PrimTypes" are RPGEO_TRIANGLE and RPGEO_TRIANGLE_STRIP.

The code or API call rapi.rpgCommitTriangles you're referring to seems to be specific to a particular software, framework, or game engine, and its logic may not be universally known or standardized [heardle](https://heardlewordle.io/). To understand the logic behind this code, you would need to refer to the documentation or resources provided by the software or framework where it's used.
