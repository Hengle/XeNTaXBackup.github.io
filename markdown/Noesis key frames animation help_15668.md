- Post Title: Noesis key frames animation help

I'm working on an noesis script for pmt animation files but having trouble with the rotations.
When applying the animation some bones get weirdly rotated.
Playing it I can see that it plays how it's supposed too except the weirdly rotated bones.
Setting the rotation key frames to 0 causes the model to clump together aswell.
So I'm guessing it's not using the animation is not working from the bind poses set rotations and I have no idea how to fix this.
so any help would be appreciated.

Edit: Figured it out
