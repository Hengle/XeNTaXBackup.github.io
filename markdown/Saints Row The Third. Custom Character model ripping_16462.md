- Post Title: Saints Row: The Third. Custom Character model ripping?

Is this possible? To extract your custom characters with a Program that's like 3D Ripper DX, Or Ninja ripper? (I tried both but either it doesn't launch with 3D Ripper, and I cant get past the launcher with Ninja Ripper. Any help?)
