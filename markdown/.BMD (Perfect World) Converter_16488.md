- Post Title: .BMD (Perfect World) Converter

Hey guys,
i search for a .bmd converter to similar format like 3ds, obj, fbx or something. That files are 3d models from Perfect World and i dont know, how open it. 3d Converter cant read that format.
I saw, that other people search for it and some guys said, its a little bit identically with the .smd format.

There are bmd to smd converter, but nothing opens my bmd files. I attached 2 bmd files with textures here:

Regards

Sure, its the litmodels.pck file. But for this u need to combine litmodels.pck and litmodels.pkx first, before extract. The textures for the bmd's are the dds files from the building.pck file.
I look into a bmd file and it beginning with mox xDD but i dont know, if there is a great difference between bmd and mox files.
Do you mean, its possible to integrate bmd to 3d converter?

I did try to combine the models.pck and models.pkx file using the following commands, but I got a 611 bytes file:

copy models.pck+models.pkx newfile.pck
copy models* newfile.pck


How did you do it?

I am trying the copy /b models.pck+models.pkx newfile.pck command.
I have got a combined file, but the sPCK.exe -x newfile.pck command crashes the sPCK.exe file.

Can you tell me your procedure?

I found that tool i attached here. Its called GSpck.

1. Make sure, that gspck.exe and spck.exe are in the same folder with litmodels.pck and litmodels.pkx.
2. Start gspck.exe
3. click on the "other" tab and combine litmodels
4. then go to "lit/models" tab and extract it

thats all i think

I released the v6.512 as a web update now.

How to get the 3D Object Converter v6.512:
Please download the 3D Object Converter from [http://3doc.i3dconverter.com](http://3doc.i3dconverter.com) and install it or download and use the portable version.
After it just use the Help/Check for updates... function to get the v6.512.

I recommend to copy all of .bmd and .dds files to the same folder. If you open a .bmd file (and you turned on the textured view) you will see the full textured model.
