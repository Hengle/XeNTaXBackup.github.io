The similarity between the GLA in Command and Conquer: Generals and the Freedom fighters in Lybia currently is stunning.

I think that art imitating life because art is trying to assimilate the realistic situations especially relating to militancy, insurgency, rebellion guerrilla warfares etc. 

and these real situations are depicting in forms of action or combat or warfare games!
