- Post Title: Chinese Game zaizhan .Mesh .OBJ

This is a game that stopped in China.
His original PAK packet has been unlocked by me.
However, there are .obj and .mesh files that cannot be opened, as well as animation files .mmb and .ani files.
I use the editor to open and find a line .Mesh "4U Tech 1 MESH File"  .ani "4U Tech 1 Animation Data File" .mmb  "4U Tech 1 Animation File  "  .obj "4U Tech 1 Object File  "
I can't open it with a lot of tools.
Please help me see...
Thanks.

Looks like an easy format. Here is an example using hex2obj.

Hex2obj I am not very likely to use！

Viewed on other commonly used software without scripts or plugins.
Thanks！
