I hate webpage editors to guts now; programmers of stupid tools that change bloody links without bloody warning must be punished severely.   

You are right. Fixing it right now. Try again,

Still get an HTTP 404 "not found" error on both MultiEx links.

I tried the version from Sourceforge but it has runtime errors whether I let it download the update or not.

Whoever manages the sourceforge version should include an installation note or a setup utility.  It's unclear which directories the files (eg DLLs) should go to: e.g., bass.dll wasn't found until trial and error had been iterated several times.

I wasn't finished yet.   

Please try again. Make sure you refresh your browser. 

As for MexCom on Sourceforge, I will update that later to the new version, and give info on where to put what. 

Besides, it's open source.
