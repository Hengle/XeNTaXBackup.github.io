- Post Title: Request IL2 forgotten battles and Pacific Fighters

I was hoping support could be added for the mentioned games, IL2/IL2FB or pacific fighters.  

The games are actually intercompatable, with pacific fighters being able to be installed as a standalone game, or as an addon to FB. 

 The data files use a type of archive I've never seen before, *.SFS.  One of the smaller sized files you'll find attached as an example.

*Arg the file won't attach(yes its zipped)*

Here's an .sfs file from Pacific Fighters in cutter format.

Thanks for posting the file, I wasn't able to get the filecutter working  

I really hope they can get support for il2 and PF.  support is dwindling from the developers(and IMO they are very stubborn about certain things)

Np mate. 

Out of curiosity...was the problem that you couldn't get the filecutter to work (and if so, in what way), or was it that you couldn't get the file to attach to your post?

Just so you know, there is a 256 KB sizelimit on forum attachments.

It just kept giving me some error when I went and cut the file, then said fb_3do.sfs.zip was created, yet it wasn't.

Apparently some kid managed to get into the files and mod them to make some more planes flyable.  For the life of me I can't figure out how(why I posted the request   ) but I'd like to do the same, I doubt many more planes are coming from patches, and if the model format is something common, I might be able to make things myself  

multiex is a lovely little tool,  I think I can finally mod MW4 vengeance and its addons so that all the IA missions will work in mercs and all the mechs

I'm having a similar problem, although it says the .zip can't be created. However, the end result seems to be pretty much the same: no zipfile.

A small workaround that might work (works for me) is to open the destination folder in your explorer (the directory in which the file is supposed to be created) and watch it closely during the process of using filecutter. At some point you might see a folder named "pak" being created. If so, you can select it and copy & paste it to somewhere else. That way you'll at least have access to the relevant files and you can then zip them yourself or whatever.

I realize this might be a bit off-topic in this section, however you could report this problem in the "Troubleshooting" section of the forum. I already started a thread there reporting my problem and it sounds your problem is related, if not the same.

Cheers
