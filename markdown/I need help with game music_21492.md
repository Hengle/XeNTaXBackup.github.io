- Post Title: I need help with game music

Hello,
Detroit: Become Human for PC came out today, but unfortunately there's no option to turn off the music.
That's really bad because I want to make videos for YouTube and it ruins the music if I have to edit and cut the videos.
I want to record without music and add the music later. So is there a way to delete the Soundtrack file in the folder?
The game is folder is full of BigFiles.

For example:

BigFile_PC.d01
BigFile_PC.d02
BigFile_PC.d03
BigFile_PC.d04
...

I don't know where to find the music.
Can anyone help me? It should be pretty easy to just delete the music or turn it off somehow right?
Heavy Rain and Beyond Two Souls are the same. So if you have one of those games it should work the same way.
For some reason the games Heavy Rain and Beyond Two Souls allow you to change the music volume. Detroit doesn't
