I was wondering if there were any alternatives to viewing and extracting the .WPK files for Battle of Europe, since Game Extractor doesn’t give any proper file names and the file extensions are blank.

There are no visible name strings stored in this archive, which leads me to believe that no, there are no possible names (Unless they are hashed somehow in the file). I'm almost positive no one will be willing to figure out the algorithm, as there probably is not enough interest.
