- Post Title: Help Gameloft's models .BDAE

I am new in this forum but I need help.
I want to extract models from the android game of disney "Disney Magic Kingdoms"
The game is free, and has many models of all Disney movies. After reviewing the game files, I found the .tga textures which I can not open with photoshop, and the .bdae I do not even know how extract it (sorry I'm super noob)

I have seen tutorials here but I do not understand how to use the "hex2object"
Anyone help me to use this program or extract the models?
Well here I leave the models of the movie "Zootopia", I found them in the game and they are what I need.

for judy_hopps_diff.tga extract it with 7-zip to get the pvr files which you can convert to usable with PVRTexTool.    
i also extracted little_endian_not_quantized.bdae from judy_hopps_costume_basic.bdae with 7-zip for kicks, though
this is not really necessary if using Hex2obj.

LOL ARE YOU A PRO
No idea how you did that (99 hours in this?)
It would be very helpful if you did some tutorial for noobs like me.
Downloading PVRTools...
