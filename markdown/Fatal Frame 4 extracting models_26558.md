Not sure about g1m but the .RSL loads the models and textures, use this plugin [viewtopic.php?t=15661](https://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?t=15661) and their github [https://github.com/Zheneq/Noesis-Plugins](https://github.com/Zheneq/Noesis-Plugins)

Perhaps we are talking about a remake. I don't have the game, but from looking at steamdb it looks like the files are compiled in *.gmpk. If I unpack it, will I find files such as g1m,g1t and g1a?

the RSL files are included into the steam port.

mostly, thou some models won't work with this method, perhaps it need t get updated or maybe just needed to work on the Steam ver.
