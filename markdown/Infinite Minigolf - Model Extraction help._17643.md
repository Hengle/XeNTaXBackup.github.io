- Post Title: Infinite Minigolf - Model Extraction help.

Hi everyone,

I was lucky enough to find a QuickBMS script that allowed me to extract Zen Studios .pxp files. But, now I've done that with the avatar file, I'm left with many different file types, which include: .CFG, .CSB, .PXA, .PXM and .PXT. Does anyone know how to extract any of them, the files are for the avatars, so I assume some of them are 3D Models, but I have no idea how to use Hex Editors, and I've always relied on Extraction Tools, so if you need any example files or information, you might need to tell me how to do that.

Thanks,
Dan

If you do want to help yourself, why not start from here?

It's never a bad idea to upload some samples. If you're uncertained about what files contain models, you may try to get a clue based on the folder/file names.

Thanks for the reply.
I've attached just one file as an example. I will be sure to look at the links you provided to.

That's just an image file.
The wrapped raw data look like this:

Might need a little more research to get the correct result though.

OK. Thank you. Once again, I'll look into all of this.
