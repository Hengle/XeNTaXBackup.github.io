- Post Title: Naruto Storm 4 Spanish Voices

Hello, I don't speak English very well, I hope you can understand me.

I'm making a mod for the video game Naruto Clash of Ninja (Wii), so I need the voices in Spanish available in Naruto Shippuden Ultimate Ninja Storm 4 (Steam)

How can I do it? What I tried in many ways and could not find the audios.

(I also replied to your thread on ZenHAX, but I'll reply here as well.)

I wrote a guide on extracting audio files from another CyberConnect2 game which should use the same (if not a very similar) format. I believe Storm 4 uses the same type of XFBIN files, so the BMS script provided by DKDave in my thread should hopefully work on the files from the PC version of Storm 4 as well.

Here is my guide: [viewtopic.php?f=21&t=23274](https://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=21&t=23274)

I hope this helps!
