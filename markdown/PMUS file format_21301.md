- Post Title: PMUS file format

I am tiring to extract video from file "mov999.pmv", which came from final fantasy 11 install. I have tired using vgmtoolbox to demux the file with no luck. I also tired using ffmpeg to read the file with no luck. Need help with this file format. attaching screenshot.
