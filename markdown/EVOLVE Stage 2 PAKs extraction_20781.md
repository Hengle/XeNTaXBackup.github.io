- Post Title: EVOLVE Stage 2 PAKs extraction

Hey all.

Was wondering if any of you, that has knowledge in CryEngine PAKs archives, can please take a look in making the updated EVOLVE Stage 2 archives extract, ever since they re-relased this version and updated it with new content, files can no longer be extracted, the RSA key is the same, just structure seems changed for either how are being decrypted/extracted.

In the link below I included an OLD sample that can be extracted, and a NEW one that can no longer be extracted for comparison as well as a monster and character smaller samples, also the exe tool with its required KEY is included, as well as the old source code that everything was based on regarding this decryption/extraction tool.

Thank you.

Just a nudge, hoping it may get noticed by someone experienced.

I modified the tool decrypt to export the CDRInfoDecrypt.
The old SAMPLE is the "Central directory" (in zip structure) but the new one is not.
So the key or algo is wrong.

Thank you for looking in to it, appreciated.

There are only two keys stored in the executable, only one of the keys is working with OLD assets, but not the NEW ones, and since the structure of the archive has been changed, it cant be a wrong key.

```

also [signsrch](http://aluigi.altervista.org/mytoolz.htm#signsrch) shows the following, unfortunately no clue how to use this info beyond this:

```

And this does not work either in same manner, as the DLL specified does NOT exist in this game, the key is stored inside the executable.
