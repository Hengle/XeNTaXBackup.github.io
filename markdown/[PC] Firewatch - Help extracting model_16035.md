- Post Title: [PC] Firewatch - Help extracting model

Hello, totally newbie here.
I want to 3d-print the main character from the game Firewatch.
I know the game was developed using the Unity3d Engine.
Any suggestions on the direction for extracting a 3d model in such game?
How can I procede?
I appreciate your time and answers.
Thanks!
