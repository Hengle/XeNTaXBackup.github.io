- Post Title: Help with Converting .rx2 Stadium to .rx3 for FIFA PC

Hi guys,

I really need your help with converting one stadium from FIFA09, the Millennium Stadium in Wales. I have found both the PS3 and the XBOX360 versions, but they are both, as of now, uneditable file types, .rpsgl and .rx2 filetypes. How can I convert them to FIFA11 PC's .rx3 format?

In this uploaded rar are both the X360 and PS3 versions of the Millennium Stadium from FIFA09. The XBOX360 files are .rx2 and the PS3 files are .rpsgl.

Any Help will be appreciated.

I just need those last 3 files!
