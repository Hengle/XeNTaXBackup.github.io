- Post Title: Tomb Raider - Anniversary - BIG File (.001 .. .00X)

Hello everybody 

Did anybody tried to unpack that big archives ? 

Archives are encrypted and compressed,every unpacking tool which i tried failed to load archives.

When I disassembled main pe file,i found decrypting procedure but I"m unable to rewtite it as function to programming language (bacause I dont know asm very well).

But at first look it using xor,neg and other operations.


Did anybody found any important information about that archives ??? I"ll appreciate any help.

Sorry they couldn't help you with your problem but as near as I can tell the programs they have for Anniversary work just fine. That link I gave you is to a modding thread where the users have made lots of skins for Lara.

> You can also modify the complete levels textures, both background and foreground (thanks Chi for reminding me). The members can then download your work and use it whilst playing Tomb Raider Anniversary.

 I believe you are correct that no one has made an extractor to completely rip all the files from the big files such as models and prefabs.

So if you don't know enough asm to understand the code properly, how can you be sure that this is the encryption routine? xor doesn't need to mean encryption.

I"m not able to rewrite it to programming language which I"m using - Delphi.
I know basic assembler very well,but thats function is really long and using for example variable jumps like jmp EAX + 32 and so on...

I"m 100% sure that its decrypting function because stepped that functions.... many loops ... many maths and many switches.

And also,you can see in stack the ASCII text: "BIG File" which is magic of big files.
Or one thing which it proves it that it loads that big files and then it decrypts in that function,because that filenames are shown in stack while it decrypting....

Just know that its right function...
