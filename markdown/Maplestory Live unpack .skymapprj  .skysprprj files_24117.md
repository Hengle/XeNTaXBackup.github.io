Some of these files appear to be a PNG image container.

If you use this .bms script with Quickbms, you will be able to extract the images.

Like I said, only some of them seem to contain png images, sorry but I don't know what to do with these other files. Maybe it's the files to make the animations of the images but I could be completely wrong.
