- Post Title: extract game with ninjariper

I am extracting an online game. Using the ripper ninja can get the model, but it has lots of junk files. flat surfaces. it doesn't give me all the models in the game map I'm playing. Does the riper ninja only output models in certain ranges ??

it only outputs what is rendered on screen in that very frame (interval) you rip. in terms of precision of the framing it may only output what can be stored fast. even when flinging the camera around it may still only rip certain assets in the field of view, that can be written to the harddrive in time and one after another. hence why big amounts of data in MB usually need a long frame interval and a steady camera motion to get most of it.
