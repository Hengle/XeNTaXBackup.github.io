- Post Title: PS2 Texture Extractor [FFXII]

I am trying to extract some (or all) textures from a PS2 exclusive game called "Final Fantasy XII".

Because its a PS2 game cant be played on PC, but you can use emulator for do it.

I try alredy to get that, using some software like "3D riper" and Texmod.

3D riper may works cause i can see a message in the game screen where says ""Ready to capture"" but it dont capture nothing.

Just a few deep black *.dds files, i think corrupted files.

Yes, i have a software for open and read DDS (from Nvidia) but this files arent good.

I have some version of that game, i alredy have the REAL game in PAL (buyed in a real shop) also have some NTSC version.

The PS2 emulator only takes the NTSC version, PAL dont start cause any type of protection or a video (FMV) conflic.

It doesnt matter.

My PC is a few old, so emulator dont work well, but works.

I AM trying to FIND a software for EXTRACT direclty from the NTSC GAME ISO (that i am sure it works, cause i play it, via emulator) to PC.



This is a conceptual art, of what i am looking for.

But another software will help also.

I dont have linux, so the program for do extract the textures must work in a Windows XP SP2.

Also, with VISUAL interface, forgot text commands please.

Any expert user can help me with my trouble?

Thank you.
