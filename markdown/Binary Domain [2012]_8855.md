Hi,

does anybody know if is possible to extract the game texts from this game from SEGA? I know there are some .par files like at console version.

Thanks

The texts are in the .stb files in string_tbl folder.

You extracted this with a BMS script? I'd like to make a localization for this game.

Yes, I see, thank you for the links.  What I meant is what program did you use for extracting texts or converting the .stb file? I'd like to use it to localize the game, like your team.

But you still converted the file into .txt somehow. I wonder if you did it by using QuickBMS or some hex editor?

Oh. Thank you for the answer. Sorry, I'm quite amateur in this subject. So converting and editing is only possible with severe limitation on text length.
