- Post Title: Successfull PS2 games

I read the forum rules, but i'm still not sure whether i should post this here or not, if this is not the place, just remove it plz.

I have the request of the names of the PS2 games which both it's sound (vocal) and the movie files have been successfully extracted, decoded and encoded. The reason i need these games is that i like to change the PS2 games language and repack the game and have my own archive of the dubbed games.

I've been buying games and then trying to find out how i can decode/encode the sound/movie files, but maybe only 1/20th of my games were possible to be fully done. So it didn't worth the effort. Therefore I posted this message here, because here are some who are so expert and experienced that might know the right games i should go after.

Thanks in advance.
