- Post Title: ANOTHER tga.ckd/png.ckd request (Wii U/PC/Ps4?) (Just Dance)

This thread is very similar to this: [viewtopic.php?f=18&t=16427](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=18&t=16427)
So I'm counting on @AceWell to help me out here.

I'm attaching  ̶s̶o̶m̶e̶  a lot of samplez of texture and picture ckds, enough to (hopefully) get an algorithim/program to convert ckds to png and (hopefully) back.

all of your samples look corrupt except 2, but between Xentax and Zenhax i've already 
posted a few scripts for various Just Dance versions and platforms that will allow you to 
open and convert them to png or whatever.

A lot of the CKD files can be edited in a hex editor.
