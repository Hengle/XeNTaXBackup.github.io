- Post Title: 3ds Max Script Animating Help

I am working on a model importer for the game Age of Mythology. The file I'm importing is an intermediate file that I made to make it easier to import.

When I import the meshes, they all get placed in the same spot. I have no idea how to animate them. Each mesh in this case should be one frame.

The animation code I tried doesn't work right.

Here's a sample file: [http://petar.outer-heaven.net/animal%20 ... ttacka.br3](http://petar.outer-heaven.net/animal%20baboon%20attacka.br3)
And the Code: [http://petar.outer-heaven.net/AoMBrg.ms](http://petar.outer-heaven.net/AoMBrg.ms)

EDIT: I figure it out, but check question below.

Sorry, I figured it out. It turns out my timing is off. I really don't understand how all this timing stuff works in 3ds max.

When I play the animation, it goes by really fast.

Edit: It turns out its some setting in 3ds max that's making the animation play ultra fast. Worked fine for a friend. Thread can be closed.
