- Post Title: PaRappa the Rapper PSP .bin (Free DLC)

I have the DLC for PaRappa the Rapper PSP, which basically replaces the song with another track. It's in .bin format, and after scanning it with HyperRipper and Game Extractor, it finds a wav, that's apparently the length of the original track, but all of my media players aren't playing it. Any idea what's wrong?

Sample (the DLC was free during its time, so it is legal): [https://dl.dropbox.com/u/66564653/ST2VER01.BIN](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/66564653/ST2VER01.BIN)

well that works for the DLC, but the wav files in the game are acting really funny when played, they skip around and restart. If I send it to an online converter, I get this:

(the song skips, and it's only half the song)
