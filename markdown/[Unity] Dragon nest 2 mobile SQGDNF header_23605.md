Game: Dragon Nest 2 mobile
Reference: [https://www.tap.io/app/170653](https://www.tap.io/app/170653)

Hi guys, game use unity ( was able to import just couple of assets in Assetstudio ). Most of the .ab archive starts with SQGDNF, there are thousands of them. There is also a bundle_list.data in the samples. 
Any idea how to open it?
