- Post Title: FEE Model Extraction

I am using asset studio to extract files from Fire Emblem Engage, but the animations/bones export as a .json file. How to I get it to a point in which these could be bones in blender? All of the textures and meshes extracted perfectly fine, just I don't know how to combine the bones into these.

i have no idea how you managed to export it as a .json file

selecting the file in scene hierarchy in assetstudio should export it as an .fbx, when selecting it from the model drop down
