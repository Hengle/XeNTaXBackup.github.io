Hi guys,

I have been visiting the forums every day, and have downloaded all the sample files - i hope to be able to look at them before July. Truth is, I have been terribly busy programming and working - had to do assignment marking for about 10 hours yesterday, so i havn't had time to look at them at all.

Be assured that I do have the files, and I will be looking at them as soon as possible - things should be calming down now so I will have some spare time to work through the buildup of 78 archives   

In the meantime, I would like to thank Mr Mouse and the people on the wiki for their help in the format analysis, and to KorNet for his work on the scripts! Keep up the great work guys!

Talk to you soon.

Greetings Watto  It is worked as we can  Here wished to tell in occasion of Game Extractor... Here I remember you did a plug-in for game Restricted Area here a plug-in does not work with usual version Game Extractor, and works only in the full version... I till now cannot open archive  .... And the full version at me is not present (sadly)....

Well one of the things I have been working on is an update to Game Extractor (Basic) so that it will be able to open all the same files as the Full version - I expect the newer version to be available before July. The new version will therefore be able to open this game for you.
