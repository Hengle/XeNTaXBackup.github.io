- Post Title: Serious Sam 2 model extract problem

is anyone know how to extract serious sam 2 model? i've try using serious editor 2 to extract, but the way i go into mesh editor the model dissappear and somehow cannot undo. the export extension is also in awf and raw. i've try using serious editor 4 and it also not working because serious editor 4 cannot read the files from serious engine 2. using Ninjaripper is also not working. the game won't launch from ninjaripper. is there another way to extract serious sam 2 model? or how can i extract the model from serious editor correctly?
