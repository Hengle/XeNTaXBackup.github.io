- Post Title: Opening PMF and AT3 files?

Hi, new user here.
I'm having trouble opening the .pmf and .at3 files extracted from the DJ Max Portable 3 .iso (using [cozy's .TPA tool extract/inject tool](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=32&t=5783)) file. 
I'm also not sure which of these files are pictures or videos.
