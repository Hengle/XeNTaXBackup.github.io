Yeah i would really love to see this importer script done for max too.  If anything could be done about that, that would be awsome.

Great work so far BTW i have been waiting for someone to attempt AVP.

just a convination of luck, an old version of 3dxripper and i have a legal copy of the game on steam) but the first cracked version somehow gave me the models on t-pose, using steam version they conserve the animation, but ripping them was pretty hard back then and the humans always got their faces missing

Hi,


nice work man!
Could you upload your AVP3 stuff? That would be very nice. (Would be interesting to know which version gave the t-posed models)

Is it possible to port every model out of the game using this script?

@revelation 
Everything is fine but how to open the model with animation like on your picture? I've got your newest program ang plugin. Also, I don't have the Pause Forward and Reverse buttons when the animation is running.

Best regards,

Load the model first, then drag and drop the animation file onto Noesis.  Press "No" at the prompt that asks you if you want to replace the current scene.  You can either press cancel at the file load dialog that pops up for the HSKN file, or pick the file that corresponds to the animation.  Usually should be the same as the model, but the plugin doe not force you to do so.  in cases where the joint counts do not match, it will attempt to name match if the skeleton is valid.

3 things,
-is it possible to get less texture groups loaded?
- can you load more than 1 animation?
- would it be possible to port maps?

but as I said before, simply great work man!

Is there anyway of getting noesis to load the textures as well or at least the material files, otherwise i can see there is gonna be a lot of fiddling within apps to get the meshes textured.

Also i noticed the asura.bms file does something wrong. nothing big but i noticed it today. when it unpacks all the textures it gives them a .tga file extension. They are actually DDS files

Hey,


I think you can't load the textures into noesis, but I'm not sure (tga itself is not bad).

Is there any way to get the Maps (except 3d ripper dx)? The Maps are really awesome, so it would be great to get them into 3d!
