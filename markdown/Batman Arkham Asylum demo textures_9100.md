I apologise if this has already been answered in a previous thread but I'm trying extract the textures from the B:AA demo and am unsure what exactly to do. Also is it the same method for both the full game and Arkham City?

I think this game made with unreal engine, so "Gildor's UE Viewer" would be helpful.

Search Gildor's UE Viewer in Google.

Try that, and post your result.
