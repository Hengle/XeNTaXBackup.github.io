- Post Title: need help.. KOEI games BGMLink.G1L (console version)

PC counterpart is easy, can be unpacked+repacked with g1l2kvs.

anyone know how to extract & reinject it??
have been researching around 4 months, only learned that it contains numerous AT3 files within. PC tools didn't work with console version. the file that i'm currently researching is BGMLink.G1L of SW4.

*in DW8XL, the header of PC version is "_L1G0000" while the console version is "G1L_0000"
