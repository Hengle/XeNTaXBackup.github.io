- Post Title: PS2 Texture Help

I've been trying to display the images from the PS2 version of Psychonauts. The Pc and Xbox versions use dds images both with and without headers. The PS2 images are set out like a Psychonauts headerless dds image, but I cant work out what format the pixel data is in.
Please see my posts about the PS2 images in [this](http://www.lucasforums.com/showthread.php?t=152305) thread, I've uploaded some examples of the files and what they should look like [here.](http://quick.mixnmojo.com/temp/ps2/)

Any help or suggestions that anyone can offer would be much appreciated.
