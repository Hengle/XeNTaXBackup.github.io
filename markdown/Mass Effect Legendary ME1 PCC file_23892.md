- Post Title: Mass Effect Legendary: ME1 PCC file

Hi guys, has anyone figured out how to decompress and unpack the PCC file? I assumed the ME1 files in Mass Effect Legendary are as same as the original version since the engine is the same and ME2 and ME3 are basically the same. I didn't find much info about Mass Effect 1, could anyone please help? Thank you a lot.
