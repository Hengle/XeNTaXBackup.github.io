- Post Title: *.TIGER files Marvel's Avengers Game [pc]

Hello everyone. Faced with format files *.TIGER. I found Tiger Decrypt (unpacker and DUMP), but they don't open on my pc. No other extractors can extract this files. As always, I'm trying to extract sounds. Maybe someone has encountered a similar format?
I attach one of the files - [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Ys5pdH ... 13dVc/view](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Ys5pdHE_fb57dYo3UrmDMUXkpdG13dVc/view)
