Hey there, I was wondering if anyone's looked into extracting the background videos in overwatch that play on the main menu. I can't seem to find anything on google as to how I'd go about it.

What background videos?
Last time I opened Overwatch, they were just loading a random map/hero and rendering them normally.

Can anyone confirm? I've been looking for the animation file of any of the main menu scenes and haven't found them yet.
