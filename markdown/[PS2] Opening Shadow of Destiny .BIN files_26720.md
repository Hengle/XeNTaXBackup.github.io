- Post Title: [PS2] Opening Shadow of Destiny .BIN files

Hey there,

Brand new to the community, and as the name implies, I'm trying to figure out the best way to unpack the files in the .BIN files for the PS2 game, Shadow of Destiny.

This is from my very own copy I burned onto my PC, so this is a legal copy.

The files I'm particularly interested in are labeled as SD.BIN and FILEDATA.BIN

I opened these up in Hex Workshop, and the only thing I've been able to glean is that in SD.BIN, the header is named as IECS, while FILEDATA.BIN doesn't look to have a header or footer signature. So far, there doesn't look to be an existing script on the BMS site in order to extract the contents inside, and searching for it only brought up a mention of PS2 BD HD audio:

[http://wiki.xentax.com/index.php/PlaySt ... D_HD_Audio](http://wiki.xentax.com/index.php/PlayStation_2_BD_HD_Audio)

In the case of FILEDATA.BIN, the only thing at in the signature is just ...', so I'm assuming it can't tell what datatype this is?

I was wondering what the best way would be to decompress these files so I can have a look inside or if someone had an idea of how I should write my own BMS script for this.

TLDR; I don't really know what the best way is to extract whatever is in these .BIN files, so any help given the above info is appreciated!

Thank you!

Kind Regards,
