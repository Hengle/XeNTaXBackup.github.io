- Post Title: Everdell localization modding won't work

Hi all.

I'm testing some string changes in Everdell for Steam using UABE and the localization file in Everdell\Everdell_Data\StreamingAssets\Localization\win folder.

Exporting works fine, but when I import the modified text the game doesn't recognize the changes.

I suspected it would fallback to the other systems l10n folders, but even if I deleted the other folder, the game starts normally.

Heck, even if I delete all localization files the game starts ok.

So, current strings in use might be elsewhere or IDK.

Any tips or ideas?
