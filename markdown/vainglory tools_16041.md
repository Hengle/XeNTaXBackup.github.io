- Post Title: vainglory tools

Hi

This is my Third Topic.Here i need help in decompressing the character model,animation and many other files from Vainglory.I searched and found that all the resources are located inside the obb file.I have opened the obb file with winrar but there are more files
which i don't understand and also don't know which files contains the resources.I tried  the vainglory model extractor tool from zenhax but it only extracts models.I want the animation,skeletons,Textures and Visual Effects or Particle effects.Please help me with this and also download the sample files from this link.
