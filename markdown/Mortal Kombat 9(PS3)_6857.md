Hey, guys im glad that you finally opened a sub-forum for us fellow translators.
I will be glad to help with anything i can in the future, but currently i dont know how to translate
Mortal Kombat for the PS3 and i want it translated into Bulgarian badly. The information in this topic will be helpful not only to me and this game deffinately deserves atention! I can find the subtitles which are in LOCALIZATION folder, but i cannot find the fonts so i could edit them and do my translation into cyrilic alphabet. Here is a list of the files in the game...

This forum is in English. Translated you said something along these lines: "I can help get the fonts, but will redraw itself"

Please continue in English.
