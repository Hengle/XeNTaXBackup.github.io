- Post Title: PS Vita Mobile Suit Gundam: Extreme VS-Force .fhm

Hello, everyone, I have a problem with unpacking the game Mobile Suit Gundam Extreme VS-Force-PS Vita. This .fhm file seems to use some kind of compression method. I tried to search the unpacking folder of this game. I not found something special, but I am confused about this .fhm. I did not find a way to decompress this kind of file. I hope you can help me. I will attach some pictures and sample links.
Thank you very much

They are compressed with ZLIB. You can use offzip to get the files
