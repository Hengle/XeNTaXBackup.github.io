- Post Title: Mass effect 2 / Mass Effect 3 3d models

I want to make a 3d art page of Mass Effect, similar to this one

http://euderion.devi...rison-433200009

But I don't know how to extract the models from ME2 and ME3 core game/dlc
can someone help?

I got myself Umodel and Umodel GUI for ME2. matter is, the gui refuses to export. it says there are no support files.

I meant something like [this](http://th03.deviantart.net/fs70/PRE/f/2014/042/5/e/mass_effect_stations_big_ships_size_comparison_by_euderion-d75wz9l.jpg)

Umodel cannot extract hi-res textures, unfortunately.
