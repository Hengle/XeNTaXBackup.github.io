- Post Title: Operation Tango Unity Text Error

Hello,


I'm trying to patch this game for Turkish language support. However, when I try to access the game files, the Text files do not appear. Can you help me how to access the game files?

That is not localization file for sure. You can see in headers that it can only store start times, end times and loc keys.

Text should be somewhere else. You can look for it using total commander method [https://ikskoks.pl/searching-text-strin ... commander/](https://ikskoks.pl/searching-text-strings-using-total-commander/)
