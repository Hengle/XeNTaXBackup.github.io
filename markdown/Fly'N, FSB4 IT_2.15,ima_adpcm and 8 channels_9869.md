- Post Title: Fly'N, FSB4 IT_2.15,ima_adpcm and 8 channels

I got this game, can extract the audios but can't play the audios with IT_2.15,ima_adpcm 44100 8 channels, the wave sounds distorted.

I tried a lot of tools all of them failed and no idea how convert to playable format.

Any idea?

Thanks
