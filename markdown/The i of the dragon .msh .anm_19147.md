- Post Title: The i of the dragon .msh .anm

This is an old game.
I unpacked them files and get many .msh .anm files,I think it is 3d models and animation.
But I don't have any way to view them.
Some files in here.

Hmm, maybe someone will remember game with similar format! I could bet I saw such format before, if there's no tool or script - then someone should create them. It's only two ways, I guess.

(uvs are wrong, weird, guess it's offset 32: tx and offset 40: ty or something like that)

Many games use .MSH .ANM
I try to use other tools open this game's files but failed.And I open it in the hex editor,I find it is based in 3dsmax.

Someone needs to write a script.
Format is simple but seems they've mixed the face indices for vertices and uvs in a strange way.
(tried every second FI and every 2nd face for uvs, at no avail)

I'd suggest to use a 3D ripper to get the uvs.

I think I did find the vertex weight (w1,w2) datas, but I did not find the vertex bone id (b1,b2) datas.

Without having these values, you can't animate these 3d models.

Maybe it in .ANM ? I don't know programming.

I did not find the vertex bone id (b1,b2) datas, but I have released The I of the Dragon .msh loader module in the 3D Object Converter v7.032 (Windows)

How to get the 3D Object Converter:
Download the 3D Object Converter from [ http://3doc.i3dconverter.com](http://3doc.i3dconverter.com) and install it or download and use the portable version.
After it just use the Help/Check for updates... function to get the v7.032.
