- Post Title: Zelda 3DS Models

I’ve been looking around the internet for a model program for a couple of 3DS games. I’ve been getting nowhere for most of the day too.    I have these assets from using Citra to dump the RomFS. I found one other program called “GAR - ZAR Unpack” that allowed me to get the models and animations. Unfortunately, this is as far as I got since there is almost nothing on the internet about the .CMB and .CSAB formats.

This is definitely an interesting piece of software. I found that saving a .blend and opening it in Blender 2.83 LTS solved some GFX problems. This statue for example: [https://imgur.com/rmB3AXo](https://imgur.com/rmB3AXo)
