Just looks like they are missing a header on them.  I am on my laptop (No Photoshop) or else I'd verify that for sure, but from my experience with DDS files, I would say it's correct.  

You prolly should have waited a little bit closer to the release date before posting this thread too.

Very strange to have .xds while the consoles also
supports DDS. (from what I've read on the internet)

But Im sure (I hope) some of you could sort it out.
I mean, the Forza also have such extractor.
It would be nice to see another subject on the Wiki and on watto.org
if there is Forza 3.
Sadley this game will not be on PC so I cant be arsed
to give up.
The meshes are also have been extracted succesfull, so there is no reason to give up  
Hopefully Forza 3 cars in GTA series and TDU, ouch, thats some hot taste!

Is there any hope to convert it to known formats like .bmp, png or tga?
The coding always started first on the PC.

Here are the (i think) complete Files for the new Ford Fiesta from the Pal Version, including textures and models... haven't gotten the textures display anything that looks like a car texture tho and the .carbin format makes no sense to me

.xds is a modified and most likely compressed verion of a .dds file native to the xbox 360 xdk. Its the same thing as the .xma audio which is another form of .wma audio. Hope that helps
