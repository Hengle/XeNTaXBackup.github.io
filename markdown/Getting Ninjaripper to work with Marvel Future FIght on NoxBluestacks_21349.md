Bluestacks is returning an error message when I try to use the injector, and Nox just hangs on a white screen for the game. How can I get either to work?

Check to make sure NOX is running Direct X, as theres a large chance its using OpenGL to render its graphics, and Ninja Ripper doesn't work with OpenGL.
