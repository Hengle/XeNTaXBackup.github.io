Any plans to update this great program so that it works with other extensions in the SWG game?

Personally, I would love to see a Shader and Mesh viewer, maybe an improved sound player that only plays the bits of sound that are sound, and not some ear drum busting code or non-intended sound 

I love this program, I also love the other 2 for SWG (this one most  and I would be willing to help financialy contribute to growing expansion of this tool.

Cheers mate.
