Anyone who can handout the standalone UnrealEd?

I had downloaded the UDK but it was not included, at least no editor that can import and export .uax files.

according to a quick google the uax files are for the first version of the engine while the UDK is for 3rd version

Hey there!

.uax-files are used in UnrealEngine 1, in games like Deus Ex 1, Unreal 1 or so 
If you just want to extract it's contents you could use Dragon Unpacker.

The UDK is powered by the Unreal Engine 3, which is not using the .uax-fileformat anymore. 

I don't know if it does work standalone, but if you do have one of these UnrealEngine 1 games (I have Deus Ex 1 and Unreal 1), you can easily get access to the UnrealEd, where you can create and save your own uax-Soundpackages, or open, modify or extract already existing ones 

If I remember correctly, Unreal 1 had the Editor already implemented, but for Deus Ex you need to grab it online.

If you don't have one of these two games, you might want to search for an UnrealEngine 1 SDK for a game that uses this Engine and that you own 

Good luck

doesn't Umodel/UE viewer have full compatibility? It's the goto tool for unreal engine formats. gildor.org has it.

works fine when you enable sound export with UE viewer's GUI and then load a .uax
