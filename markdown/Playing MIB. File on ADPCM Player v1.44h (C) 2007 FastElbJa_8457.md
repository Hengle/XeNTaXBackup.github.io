- Post Title: Playing MIB. File on ADPCM Player v1.44h (C) 2007 FastElbJa

i tried MFAudio but it failed miserably   . I dont know anything about hexadecimal with interleaves and so on... So can anyone help me. I saw someone on this forum used ADPCM Player v.144h to play an Mib file [viewtopic.php?f=17&t=5755](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=17&t=5755)

Anyway, i tried that but it showed me an error. Now im stuck. Can you help me please?


Here is what the error look like:

Try using the Winamp plugin VGMstream. It should be able to playback the MIB files unless it has weird channel/s and/or interleave.

for the moment, i'll say it will contain more format than the current adpcm player (by extension all formats u can find on vgmstrem)

at this time, only 10 formats have been implemented (search+playing)

more to come

i'll post a .exe as soon as i get satisfied to show something
