- Post Title: [request] Risen 1,2,3 models

Been awhile since I threw myself into this game series. Would be cool to play around with their 3d models even though the models of first part are next to ugly. So here it is all I have so far.

[Risen samples](http://www.mediafire.com/download/59pmgc8ufgdl7rc/risen1.7z)  |  [Risen 2 samples](http://www.mediafire.com/download/5prbgkn7y5qfa8t/risen2.7z)  |  [Risen 3 samples](http://www.mediafire.com/download/3o188dneeqbi3c1/risen3.7z)

Risen:
mesh: ._xmsh format - and its [importer into 3ds max](http://www.mediafire.com/download/iqrpp861whwe1tc/3dMax_TImport_script_RisenXMSH.zip)
skinned mesh: ._xmac format - its [importer into 3ds max](http://www.mediafire.com/download/mbg2g6s78x5470k/3dsmax_importer_xmac.7z) - it's unfinished and can't import skinned head, also it need to first use xmac2obj converter, load obj into max and then import bones on the imported mesh;
Here's [original board](http://forum.worldofplayers.de/forum/threads/852455-Tool-xmac2obj) of the tools author;

Risen2:
mesh: ._xmsh - it seems the same format as risen1 has;
skinned mesh: ._xskn - unknow format;
However there's a [board for risen 2 models](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?p=69140#p69140) with noesis script from chrrox on which I posted .gar files. I'm not sure where I dig them out, maybe it's from old version of the game;

Risen3:
mesh: .r3msh
skinned mesh: .r3skn
This two formats are pretty similar to what risen2 have and there's a [board on xentax](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?p=103719#p103719) with blender script from Szkaradek.

would be cool if someone willing to help me with this.

p.s.: all the games are the latest steam versions.

Hi
About Risen 1.
Here is an Blender importer for meshes and animations.
It works with version 249b. So install Blender and doubleclick file "Blender249.blend"

That's just great! Thank you for this, Szkaradek123! Can you tell what with the other games?  Are they hard to decode or they store needed information somewhere else?

just a quick adaptation of blender script for Noesis

*(Not guaranteed to work with all models)
