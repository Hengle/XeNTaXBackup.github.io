We've translated the game into Bulgarian. You can download our files from the patch and use them if you want from here - [http://www.playonbg.info/download.php?view.46](http://www.playonbg.info/download.php?view.46)

but i cannot help you with the ressources, because a coleague of mine did them for this game.
At least you can see which files we did modified and use our text file which if i remember correctly was made to use more symbols than the original restricted one.
