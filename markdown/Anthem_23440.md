Can someone work on a script to dump all files (EBX, Chunks, Res, and etc.) from Anthem? I would love to get the sounds as well.

I recently tried this script: [https://github.com/xyrin88/anthemtool](https://github.com/xyrin88/anthemtool)
Unfortunately it's too old and it doesn't work anymore.

Someone is able to update it?

Actually that script was never finished, the guy that started it (xyrin88), never added full support for the game, in beginning i was testing his script in helping determine bugs so he can fix them, but he never came back to finish it, its abandoned, nor has he ever responded to my messages ever since.
The user Nicknine said he might take over in adding support over to his master script that works to almost all games now, but last time i asked he was busy with other projects, doesn't hurt you to ask him as well.

That's a pity, but I hope that Nicknine guy will take over and do the magic.
Do you know which other games those scripts work with except the ones made with the Frostbite Engine?

The name already says it all, Frostbite engine games, nothing else.

This tool works on lastest version of anthem from Orign. You just need to add few old dlls in game folder (oo2core_6_win64.dll / oo2ext_6_win64.dll). Also you can get models and textures using frosty editor.

I would avoid it if i where you, the script is incomplete, it does not dump the entire game.

I can confirm. I already tried and it didn't work. I hope someone will find a way to extract it.
