- Post Title: Xenoblade Chronicles 2 .nop file format

Hello everyone! I've recently discovered this lovely forum after trying to research a certain part of the game called Xenoblade Chronicles 2 on the Nintendo Switch. So I've gone and dumped the game and it seems all the audio is in the .nop file format. I have no problem converting it to a different audio format, but I would like to be able to do the opposite, and potentially make a sound mod for the game. I've replaced the sounds from other sounds in the game so far, but that is very limiting as you might be able to tell. Any help on what I can do to potentially change a regular audio file format like .wav, .ogg, .mp3 to .nop would be greatly appreciated. Thank you for reading this post.

Okay, so I tried foobar and was able to convert an ordinary audio file into a .nop, however it does not have the correct metadata. This is what I mean: [https://imgur.com/a/HiN3kq4](https://imgur.com/a/HiN3kq4). For what I am using the .nop for, it NEEDS to have the correct metadata or it will not work.
