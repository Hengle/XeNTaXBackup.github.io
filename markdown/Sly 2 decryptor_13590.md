Aluigi has written a BMS script that can extract the data from the .WAL archives

Fat chance of it ever being cracked, since Sucker Punch, and also the guys who made Ratchet and Clank did some type of thing that hides the WAL files from the ISO. Though, if you create an ISO file, it copies those files over into the ISO, but still are invisible. Unfortunate.
