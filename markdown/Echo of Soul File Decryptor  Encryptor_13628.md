I don't have the game anymore. Got rid of it since it was pay to win and not enjoyable.

did you remove the source from github too? your reverse engineering findings were interesting and i wanted to read your source  

nope, just saw you made the move from github. here it is: [https://gitlab.com/atom0s/EoSTools](https://gitlab.com/atom0s/EoSTools)

eosdec
eosdec, short for Echo of Soul Decryptor, is a tool that can decrypt protected EoS files that use the in-house custom encryption. 

Usage: eosdec.exe [file]

Multiple files can be passed at once. eosdec is drag and drop friendly!
eosenc
eosenc, short for Echo of Soul Encryptor, is a tool that can encrypt files to be readable by Echo of Soul.

Usage: eosenc.exe [file]

Multiple files can be passed at once. eosenc is drag and drop friendly!

none of my downloaded VS2015 does not compile the source code. There is some special feature? can to the PM to throw the compiled versions, please.
