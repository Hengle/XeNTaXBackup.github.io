- Post Title: Far Cry Instincts Heightmap Format

Hello

Help, please, recognize the Far Cry Instincts Heightmap format. 
This game uses modified Cryengine 1, but heightmap data of levels not stored in known *.h16 raw format, it is something other. Files have *.sdat extension and "KNRT" id. 


[This is a sample of heightmap from first game level.](http://www.mediafire.com/file/f84b58icfg4k33r/terrain.zip)
