- Post Title: Prince of Persia "Warrior Within" - How to play sf

I wrote a litte program which reads the *.fat files of Prince of Persia - Warrior Within and extracts the selected soundfile out of the *.big file.
But now I have a problem:
How can I make this extracted files playable??

Do I have to convert the files, or are they in a playable format??

Ok, thank you, I'm going to look for this program.
But if I want to program such a tool by myselfe, how do I have to konvert the files??

---
Hm, is it true that MF Audio is only for Playstation Games??
I'm sorry, but I forgot to tell you that I have only the PC-Version of the Game.
If I'm wrong and the tool  is also for the PC-Versien can you send me a link to a download page, because I only found deadlinks.

you can play files extracted with "Awave Studio" or softwares use raw method for playing unknown sound files

download "Awave Studio" from below link : 

[http://www.fmjsoft.com/](http://www.fmjsoft.com/)

thus mfaudio use raw method for playing unkown sound files.

They are *.bik, but the RAD-Tools don't play them. Where is the problem.

And how can I look at the artworks (also *.bik)??

Well, I also tried to play the videos with the current version of the RAD-Tools but Binkplayer told me that this are no playable *.bik files.
So, where is the problem??

Furthermore I found the right wave-format for the data of the *.big-files.
These files are 16-bit mono PCM (signed),
but this are only the sfx and not the real music.
It looks like the backgroundmusic of the game is inside the *.bf file.
But how to get it??

Prince of Persia files have a small extra header at the top, if you remove this header, you can play them in Bink/RADPlayer

Thank you for the answer.
How long is this special header??
May be it's easy to find this header inside the *.bik-file but I'm not at home at the moment and so I can't try to seek this special header.

And what about the artworks?? Are they also *.bik-movies??

It works!!!
fmv-explorer showed me where the real bik-file begins and I wrote a little program which extrated all Artworks. After all I converted them with the RAD-Tools to *.jpgs.
Great!!
Now I'm going to try to extract  the music with fmv-extractor 1.3.
If it doesn't work I'll tell you .

Oh, that's great because I already have written a *.bf-extractor.
Are the musicfiles also PCM-signed 16 bit or has the music another formate than the sfx-sounds??

Well I extracted all files but now I don't know what kind of wavefiles they are.
The problem is that the music-files are not similar to the sfx-files.
For example I can't  play the "menu1.sb0" file which should be the backgroundmusic of the title menu.

So how to play the music??
Does anybody know??

It doesn't work   .
It seams like Sb0dump is only able to convert *.sb0-files of "Prince of Persia Sand of Time".
If I try to convert a file with Sb0dump I'll get the message that it is no real sb0-file.

Do you know a tool which can convert "Prince of Persia Warrior Within" Music, too??

Now I have what I wanted. Thank you all for your support!!!!
