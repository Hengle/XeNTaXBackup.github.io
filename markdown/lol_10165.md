so... anyone recognize the compression types used in that one new leaked game LOL?

previous game installments looked like this:

CDRM  0x00000000 number of compressed chunks 0x00000000
size of compressed data
size of compressed data
size of compressed data
padding
aligned zlib compressed data
aligned zlib compressed data
aligned zlib compressed data
padding

now it's

CDRM 0x00000000  number of compressed chunks 0x00000000
type of compression, size of compressed data
type of compression, size of compressed data
type of compression, size of compressed data
padding
aligned ??? compressed data
aligned ??? compressed data
aligned ??? compressed data
padding

ran some sample data through luigi's comscan but nada nada, also tried inserting common compression signatures as well and nada nada too.

if you don't know what game i'm talking about, come over here, so I can slap you with a big black bear dong he he he.
