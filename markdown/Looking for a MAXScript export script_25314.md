- Post Title: Looking for a MAXScript export script

Hello,
I'm trying to play with an old MMO models, which I've managed to do thanks to an importer I've found on this forum.
I've understood the basics on how this is done. Now I'm trying to do the reverse thing by exporting those models back.

Does someone have an example MAXScript that does that kind of thing (reading the 3ds objects, and animations then obtaining the mesh vertices, textures .etc to convert them into binary data.
I'm still not familiar with MAXScript and 3D modeling in general, so looking for those functions in the documation gave me a lot of troubles.
I'll be grateful if someone can help me.

Thank you.
