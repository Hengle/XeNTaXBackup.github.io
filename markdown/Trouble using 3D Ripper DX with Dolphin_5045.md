- Post Title: Trouble using 3D Ripper DX with Dolphin

I posted a thread a couple months ago with the same problem, but I've only today managed to lay hands on my older versions of both 3DRipperDX and Dolphin on the advice of someone who responded to my last thread. I'm trying to use 3DRipperDX with the Dolphin Wii/GameCube emulator, and I did manage to get it working once before but my old computer couldn't handle it. Now I've been trying to get it working on my new computer with no luck; I can get Dolphin to open through 3DRipper easy enough, but once there, it doesn't show me the 'ready to capture' message in the upper left like it should if everything's working right.

I seem to recall that when I got it working on my old computer, there was a setting I had to change somewhere in Dolphin to make it DirectX compatible and therefor something 3DRipper could understand, but I can't remember what or where the setting was. Tonight, I've tried two different builds of 3DRipper (1.5a and 1.8.1) with three different versions of Dolphin (Unknownforce's builds Win32-4429 and Win32-4440, and Dolphin 2.0) and none of these combinations worked for me. Does the setting I mentioned ring a bell for anyone? Anyone know what I have to change to make one of these work?

I had the same problem when trying to do this and I know it had something to do with Dolphin using a different setting at first and that you needed to change it into DirectX if I am correct. Not quite sure what setting that was again though. Hope it helps a bit.
