- Post Title: Final Fantasy II PSP resource files.

Hello brilliant folks. Recently I've been exploring the resources for this game and other than the GIM's there's no support for any other files in the massive "bin" file that exists within the game. ff2_data.bin contains all the game data used, and if you do a search for it on google, you can find a simple command-line program that unpacks the beast of a file and exports your files to a selected folder. I have done such and have discovered that the actual sprites of the game are NOT all contained in GIM's. What I NEED is the actual monster and player sprites. Below I have made a link to a file containing examples of all the file types used in the system (don't worry, none of them are all that big.) I was hoping someone here could help me find the graphic files of this and discover a way to unpack them as was done with the GIM files. I hope to rip the sprites from this game for my own use and hopefully there will be someone to thank. I myself am not very capable of programming or decrypting things so my only hope rests on the fine folks here. Anyway, as this is very important to me, I may offer compensation for the time and effort made to help me out, as I understand this is a very tedious process... Anyway, please do what you can to figure this out with me. If a command-line program could be constructed to batch extract them, that would be easiest for me to use. I am running windows XP though mind you, so no linux based operations will be effective.

Here are the files.
