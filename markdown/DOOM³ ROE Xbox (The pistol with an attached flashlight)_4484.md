.mdvmesh file is related to xbox version. I need a tool or something. I want to push you to bring back that pistol with an attached flashlight to PC. If you need some models, textures, codes or something please let me know. I will upload them for you.

Karpo's 3d converter can open up the .md5mesh meshes 
[http://web.t-online.hu/karpo/](http://web.t-online.hu/karpo/)

md5 meshes use ASCII while the .mdvmesh meshes use floating points:
#numvertexes Vertexes(x,y,z) textureCoords(U,V)
#numfaces Vertex1,Vertex2,Vertex3

However the mdv meshes are exactly the same object as the md5 meshes just a different format
