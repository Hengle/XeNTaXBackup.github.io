- Post Title: Sacred 3 messed up uv (+sample file)

hi there,
   i used Ninja Ripper on Sacred 3 and got the files normally but when open it in 3dsmax with Ninjaripper script, the uv is kind of messed up on all parts of the model, i have read and tried changing the pair numbers of uv coord from 3-4 , 4-5, 5-6, ..... up to 11-12 which gave different results but none seem right and anything above 12 wouldn't work anymore

   anyone happens to know how to fix the uv in this case? i have attached the ninjaripper script for 3dsmax and the model files in ".rip" here
thank you

You want just this model or script for Sacred 3 NinjaRipper .rip files?

thank you very much again zaramot i really am afraid to disturb you again

i would like to take the armors from both female characters in Sacred 3 and try port them to Skyrim but there are 10 of them so i guess it would take some of your time, if possible if there is a way to fix it that you think i maybe able to do it please let me know i will give it a try, but if you say it requires too much skills and you can make a script or fix the models i ripped in short time , yes please xD anything you think its best for the situation

It's okay, I worked with .rips before. I can find uv's if they were ripped with NinjaRipper. Actually, I have maxscript for .rip import already, just need to edit it for Sacred 3
