- Post Title: LithTech .dat files

Hello,

im sorry that my very first post is a request, but i would be happy if anyone could help me   
I unpacked the .XFS File with QuickBMS and i was able to watch the most of the files.
However i cant access some .dat files.
Im not sure what they will contain but i guess they are some decrypted text files.

Here are some examples:

Thanks!

What do you want? Models? Textures?
To me they're just some index files recording some asset names.
