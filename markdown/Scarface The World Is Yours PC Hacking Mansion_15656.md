- Post Title: Scarface The World Is Yours PC Hacking Mansion

First off Hi all,


I have just registered so I hope this is the right place to post this, I have been trying for weeks now with Scarface to get the mansion back to exactly the way it was at the start of the game.

I have a video if anyone wants it, showing all the different triggers and events in the first mission ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIarc313ZlQ&t=89s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIarc313ZlQ&t=89s) = Mansion Shootout)

So I have been wondering where are the mission events stored and how to reactivate them?

I really love this game and want to find out more about it, I have found the mansion style in the save game file, I can change the interior back to the mansion shootout, where the portrait falls down but there is a texture glitch in the corridor where an event should take place, I could not really find nothing else in the saved game and assume with my very limited knowledge that these instructions will either be stored in the games process or in the Cement.rcf and these instructions are obviously NOP'ed after the mission.

I have made a cheat table for cheat engine to hack, reputation, exotics, turf (kinda) Balls, Grams and Cash (clean & dirty).

but this has me absolutely stumped, I am also desperate to learn how to find such things, as the next thing I want to do in another game I would like to try and achieve myself.

Thanks all.
