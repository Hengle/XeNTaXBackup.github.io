Not sure where this goes, but for a hardcore modder as myself  It is quite troubling to have to go to my mod directory after everytime I replace files (after it rebuilds). Is there anyway you could make it save the last directory opened?? That would be quite helpful. Maybe also make some error handlers, so messages don't always pop up  I'll try to think up more suggestions in the future!

It doesn't already? That's weird. I will look into it, good idea. 

What about the messages though? You DON'T wish to see error messages?

Ya, sorry about that. Can just ignore that response besides the directory saving  Got it all working, even when it errors, I can still inject and view files. BTW, awesome program, and our CSX Modding Team would be nothing without you, keep up the great work!

Tell me, when exactly do you wish that the directory was the same as the last you opened?

When I click the top button "Switch to MultiEx Editor".

Ah I see...Okay....will fix that, I think it is already fixed though, as in the upcoming release you will have more of a Explorer like system in that panel (unlike having to click on "Browse" etc). 

Thanks for the suggestion !
