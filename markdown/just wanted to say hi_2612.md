- Post Title: just wanted to say hi

well im new to modding, and the most recent project i have tried out is getting the models from SWG to imprt to a 3d modeling program, i am using milkshape, 3ds max 9, gmax, and poser 7 (that doesnt really count for games though)

i have managed to import several models from KOTOR 1 & 2 into gmax, but cant get them translated to 3ds max 9 yet

maybe someday that will happen

if anyone has any ideas about the possibility of using milkshape to do any of the above, then feel free to pm me about it

any ideas are welcome

i will be watching the forum for more info later
