- Post Title: .dds can't be previwed

Hi guy's I got a problem with different .dds textures...
I try to load in noesis models from a game with the same format as Queen's Blade ( you can find the plugin for noesis in finale00's folder).
I succeded to load meshes but dds files couldn't not be previewed in Noesis ( I put meshes and dds in the same folder)

I give you a .rar with mesh and tex and xml... Could you try to open the .dds file or make it run in Noesis?

Here the file -->[http://www44.zippyshare.com/v/Bi5Rfoxb/file.html](http://www44.zippyshare.com/v/Bi5Rfoxb/file.html)

I don't know anything about Queen's Blade but your sample dds files are typical dds with a custom header, you can use Texture Finder to find the width and height and replace the first 128 bytes with a normal header.

By header i mean the data stored at the start of the file that usually has the width and height and format info.
take your Nachal.dds sample and open it in a hex editor and look at the first 128 bytes

```
73 66 6A 66 77 65 64 6E 77 65 72 31 38 33 23 40
24 61 6E 63 61 6C 73 64 68 23 40 24 25 39 32 38
37 35 65 79 31 33 34 35 39 31 32 34 33 5C 5D 00
00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 20 00 00 00
04 00 00 00 44 58 54 31 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 08 10 40 00
00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
```

now open it in TextureFinder and set it to DXT1 with a 128 byte shift and you'll see it is 512x512 with mip maps.

You just need a full dxt1 header for a 512x512 texture to replace the custom header.
replace the custom header with this one

```
00 02 00 00 00 00 02 00 00 00 00 00 0A 00 00 00
00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 20 00 00 00
04 00 00 00 44 58 54 31 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 08 10 40 00
00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
```
