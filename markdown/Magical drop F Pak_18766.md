- GUI mode activated, remember that the tool works also from command-line
  where are available various options like folder scanning, filters and so on

- select the BMS script to use. type ? for using the clipboard
- select the input archives/files to extract, type * or "" for whole folder and subfolders
- select the output folder where extracting the files
- open input file F:\PSX\WLH.PAK
- open script C:\Users\Kaguya-Miko\Desktop\alien_isolation.bms
- set output folder F:\PSX

  offset   filesize   filename
--------------------------------------
  2cd125c9 487071916  00000000.dat

Error: incomplete input file 0: F:\PSX\WLH.PAK
       Can't read 64 bytes from offset 2cd125c9.
       Anyway don't worry, it's possible that the BMS script has been written
       to exit in this way if it's reached the end of the archive so check it
       or contact its author or verify that all the files have been extracted.
       Please check the following coverage information to know if it's ok.

  coverage file 0     0%   88         708904     . offset 2cd125c9

Last script line before the error or that produced the error:
  66  log "" OFFSET SIZE

Press ENTER or close the window to quit

```


thank you
