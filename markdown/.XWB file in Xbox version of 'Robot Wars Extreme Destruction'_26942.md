- Post Title: .XWB file in Xbox version of 'Robot Wars Extreme Destruction'

Hi there,

So I have been looking around the Xbox version of 'Robot Wars Extreme Destruction' and I noticed that there was a file called XboxRw.xwb which contains all of the music and sfx for the game. So I had a look around, and I did manage to open it up and extract all of the files from it, however they are all very distorted and a jumble of noise, so I was wondering if anyone here would be able to help me out. I have linked it down below if anyone wishes to have a go.
Thanks!
