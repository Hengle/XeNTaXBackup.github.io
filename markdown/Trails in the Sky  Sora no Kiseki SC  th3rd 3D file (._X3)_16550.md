I'm not that familiar with 3D formats, so I need help to convert model files (._X3) from Sora the 3rd to .obj or .ply files.
Here's a ingame screenshot a scene that contains the model:

Another tool, called GameViewer, which is available at [https://github.com/prefetchnta/gameviewer](https://github.com/prefetchnta/gameviewer) can view, but not export as 3D model, these model files:


Here's a sample of the file + textures: [https://transfer.sh/CG9oD/sora_3rd_sample.zip](https://transfer.sh/CG9oD/sora_3rd_sample.zip)

Anyways, the format appears to be simple, but there's about 721 assumed small submeshes (SMs) in the sample file.
So a script is required to gather them all.
You might try a 3D ripper on a scene loaded by that famous viewer, so that you can rip some meshes, hopefully.

I used hex2obj (view link in my sig) to get one of the bigger SMs displayed:

Thanks!




I think all I need to do is figure out the space between CD3DFile_Mesh and the start of the vertices data.

Anybody know how to map textures?

well done, see you used python.

I wrote a short C program (not as short as your script  ), same result:

texturing, iirc goes like this: select object, create material, apply texture. (Or simply open an image in UV/Image editor.)

Since there's so many submeshes (SMs) it would make sense to create mtl files via code.
But there's 21 .png textures only which are listed at the beginning of the _X3 file. So some grouping of SMs is required, I guess.

I tried to apply U70i1104.png (books) manually but I couldn't find a fitting uv map.

U70i3804.png appears to fit nicely. So that's maybe a way to find the connection between texture and mesh(es) in the _X3 file.

```
   nValue[0]= 0; nValue[1]= 0; nValue[2]= 1; nValue[3]= 0; nValue[4]= 2; nValue[5]= 0;    // 0000 0100 0200
   do {
        offs2 = FindBytes(lpFBuf, j, dwFileSize-j, nValue, 6) ;       // j is offset here
        if (offs2!=0) {
            pFBuf += offs2 ; j += offs2 ;
            FIaddr_arr[cnt]= j ; pFBuf -= 4 ; j -= 4 ;
            GetDW(pFBuf, j, FIcnt, false) ; FIcnt_arr[cnt]= FIcnt ;
                //fprintf( stream, "# %3d 0x%x: %d\n", cnt, FIaddr_arr[cnt], FIcnt) ;
            if (cnt<1998) cnt++ ; else { chMB("Too many submeshes!\nbreak") ; j= dwFileSize ;}
        }
        { pFBuf += 7 ; j += 7 ; }     // 
   } while ((offs2!=0)&&(j<dwFileSize)) ;
   FIaddr_arr[cnt]= dwFileSize ;        // wichtig fÃ¼r Endabfrage

   cntMax= cnt ; cnt= 0 ;   //
   do {
        log_FIs(stream, FIaddr_arr[cnt], minFaceInd, maxFaceInd, lastFaceInd, FIcnt_arr, cnt) ;
        addrV= FIaddr_arr[cnt] -4 - vCnt_arr[cnt] * 40 ; Vsum += vCnt_arr[cnt] ;
        fprintf( stream, "# vertex addr: 0x%x\n", addrV) ;
        log_Verts(addrV, vCnt_arr[cnt], 40) ; logUVs(addrV+32, vCnt_arr[cnt], 40) ;
        cnt++ ;
   } while (cnt<cntMax);
   fprintf( stream, "# vertex sum: %d\n", Vsum) ;

There appears to be multiple textures in a set of faces, and I have no idea which face goes with which texture.
Here's my progress so far:

Here's some areas of the mesh area that I can't figure out:

Okay, so here's another sample:

The new sample was formatted a bit differently so I adjusted my script.

Textures have been mapped!!!!

I'll make a blender plugin later

Were you ever able to create a blender script at all?

I saw your script above but I'm a little unsure how to use it, it doesn't appear to be a python script, but a .moon script, which is a subset of LUA?

I'm a little out of my depth here though.

uyjulian,

Can you tell me which script did you use to extract the .dir/.dat files correctly?

I did try the following script on the
The Legend of Heroes Trails in the Sky SC       (2015)
The Legend of Heroes Trails in the Sky the 3rd (2017), but did not work correctly.

[http://zenhax.com/viewtopic.php?f=9&t=6 ... rails#p119](http://zenhax.com/viewtopic.php?f=9&t=60&hilit=trails#p119)


The ED6Unpacker.exe works fine.

Use Falconvert from here:

[http://www.pokanchan.jp/dokuwiki/softwa ... nvrt/start](http://www.pokanchan.jp/dokuwiki/software/falcnvrt/start)

It'll also convert the textures, it just doesn't work for the stages unfortunatly.

Note: For stages the PSP and the vita version (especially vita) use .it3 files, there is a converter for those but it doesn't work correctly a lot of the time.

Are you using a special plugin to make that work?

Searching on the website I can't see support for the kiseki formats at all.

The answer is very simple: it is an unreleased v6.521. The latest released version is v6.520.

I see.

Will the new update support the file formats for environments from Sora no Kiseki FC and SC because those aren't ._x3

The First is .X so perhaps second is ._X2, I haven't checked the second games file format just yet.

I can't answer to your question, because I did not find any .x or .x2 files in these game's archive files.

Here I've uploaded them from SC and FC, i was wrong on the file extensions however, it seems like 3rd and SC use the same format, but FC uses a slightly different format.

I have released the 3D Object Converter v6.521 as a web update.

How to get the 3D Object Converter v6.521:
Please download the 3D Object Converter from [http://3doc.i3dconverter.com](http://3doc.i3dconverter.com) and install it
or download the portable version and extract it into a folder.

Run the program and use the Help/check for updates function to get it.

I will release the updated i3DConverter for Mac and Linux versions later.

Sorry for no response for a while. I forgot to enable email subscriptions.

The script I made is intended to extract ._X3 files from Sora SC and 3rd. You need moonscript from luarocks installed.

Due to the hacky nature of how I extract the files, not all files will be successful in extracting.


If you're lazy, look up "Falcom 3D Model and Texture Dumps".

OpenSora.Viewer can view _X2 and _X3 files.
