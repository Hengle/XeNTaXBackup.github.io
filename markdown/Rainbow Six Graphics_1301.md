- Post Title: Rainbow Six Graphics

Hello,

i see that you have a very good knowledge of all the different file formats, so maybe you can help me.
I want to use some of the ingame loading screens from Rainbow Six 3.
I found some on the DVD which are TGA files.
But most of them can't be opened.
Some work, some not.
Do you know how to open them, or is multiex able to open this files.
or is there another programm to open this files.

if you need a sample of the files, please let me know.

Thanks in advance.

I guess they removed the tga header/tail stuff . This is seen quite often.
