- Post Title: Nekojiru Games - Extracting data from EXE

Hello, and thanks for checking out my post!

I need help getting data from a few .EXE files. I've attempted with Universal Extractor 2 and MultiExtractor. Extractor 2 found nothing while MultiExtractor can extract some things from the .EXE files, but I think there's a lot missing such as audio, models, etc. I would love if someone could help me figure this out! I have linked the programs I'm trying to figure out, but I'm mostly interested in the game NEKOJIRU UDON 2. Any help with this is greatly appreciate!

I've just found out that Nekojiru Udon 2 is a game created with Adobe Director (Macromedia Director).
So you can look here for more info on the format [http://wiki.xentax.com/index.php/Adobe_Director_Files](http://wiki.xentax.com/index.php/Adobe_Director_Files)
and you can use any tool listed on the wiki to open Director files (and remove protection if needed).

Thank you! Macromedia Director works. I used Macromedia Director MX 2004!
