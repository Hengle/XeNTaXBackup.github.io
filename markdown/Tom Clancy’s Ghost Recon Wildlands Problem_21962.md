- Post Title: Tom Clancyâ€™s Ghost Recon Wildlands Problem

Hi! A couple of days ago I started testing how to get the text out 
of the game and then I realized that I need a forge + data tool that I downloaded from here:
[https://zenhax.com/viewtopic.php?t=9138](https://zenhax.com/viewtopic.php?t=9138)
I managed to extract all the aches from the forge folder and I also found English.
Then I extracted the file in it from the data tool called 0-LocalizationPackage_English (US) .Localization_Package
I'll edit this into my language with this tool link: [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YaJHhY ... ABlCNzpQgu](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YaJHhYO7HdBlrImqWhNvVKABlCNzpQgu)
Once I was done I just had to put back the data file.
However, the text I copied to the data import failed therefore to return to the original.
I upload the files so you know what I'm talking about.
