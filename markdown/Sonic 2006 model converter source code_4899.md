- Post Title: Sonic 2006 model converter source code

Does anyone know the source code to this converter? I don't.

I read at Facepunch.com that the sonic 2006 .xno model files are cracked and can be converted with a converter.

All I want is the source code, but if anyone can supply the exe, I'd appreciate that too.



Please answer. I haven't got a reply on any of my posts in forever.

I think I am getting the hang of reverse engineering. I used XV132 hex editor to take a look at a file called, "en_zmef_Root.xno." I think this is the file's magic number:

4E 58 49 46 18 00 00 00 04 00 00 00 20 00 00 00 30
79 00 00 50 79 00 00 C0 00 00 00 01 00 00 00 4E 58
54 4C 38 00 00 00 24 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
00 2C 00 00 00 04 00 01 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
01 00 00 00 10 00 00 00

I hope this helps.

Doronetty, its no surprise to me your here.

Now, the models were available on Sonic Cult for a time, however they were banned because of things like this:


This is why you don't see many Sonic model extractors around, because of horrible things like that.

Sonic Cult did not want any of the models to be sent over to Facepunch for that reason. But someone who shall remain nameless, gave them out. So now, nobody wants to make any more converters.

Well thats a shame.

But look at what has been done. They some how got the models from the 2006 game. Was it by cracking the file format?

I wish I could know so I can get this one model.

Formats been cracked for years, the models were temporarily available on Sonic Cult before being banned. Someone leaked them to Facepunch, that's how they got it.

I get that.

What I would like to know is how to change the model file (.xno) to a 3D Studio Max file (.3DS).


Why I ask this is because I have posted a request for someone to work with xno files 5 times with no replies.

That looks like the sonic models from the xbox 360 game.
I made the converter for that game.

chrrox, Are you serious!?

I have been looking for a converter that converts sonic 2006 files.

Is it any trouble to post it or send it to me?
