Hi,


I have used the ATThrone.Tool.exe to Unpack the 2 archives very easily, but how can I open the models, I believe the meshes are .skm format.

Anyone Know?

Hi 
Here is importer for textured and skinned models from this game. No skeleton and animation.
It requires Blender 249 and Python26.
How use:
1.unpack importer anywhere.
2.run Blender249.blend
3.in Blender Text Window press alt+p and select:
-pak - archive
-skm - models
