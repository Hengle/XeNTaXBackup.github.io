- Post Title: Silent Hill 2 PS2 Version .tex Swizzled texture

Hello, I'm trying to edit some textures of Silent Hill 2 PS2 Version.

The game has two texture types.

1) 24bpp textures that I can easily edit by shtexexplorer

2) Swizzled textures in 8bpp, which I can't edit.

Through the ezSwizzle program I can create 8bpp ezSwizzle textures but when I insert it into the game through  hex editor, the game doesn't load.

Does anyone know any way to edit these textures correctly?

Example of 24bpp texture:

Example of 8bpp texture (Swizzled):

Oh, sorry. My first texture is not Swizzled, here is other test, this should work fine.
