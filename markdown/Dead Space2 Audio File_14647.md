Then the sounds are not in the archives you extract the sounds from? 
What tool do you use? Which files do you open?

I use the tool wav.exe
or towave.exe on DSDAT0 DSDAT1.
And I notice that all the files do not extract it.

strange. Rick's tool contains data to extract french audio from Dead space 2. Supposed to work. Do you see any "unknown" files in DAT files?

Ok i can't tell anything more, i need all your files. All 9 Gigabytes, the full DAT files. Or at least the first 2 DAT files.

Then I can check where is the french audio.
