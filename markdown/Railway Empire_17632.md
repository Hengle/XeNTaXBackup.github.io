Hello!

Are there anyone who have started modding this game? Would love to know if there is someone 

I have just startet doing some digging in the game. I used an old .fuk extractor for port royale 3. I managed to unpack the data.fuk files. First the files (.ini) was unreadable. I then used a zlib decompressor to decompressor the files. 

The problem I have now is to get the modified .ini files back into the game.

Would love to get some help, or just share knowledge about modding this game 

Cheers

recompress INI back with zlib

Then file repacking- unfortunately author of .fuk extractor didn't post source of his tool or archive structure, but I saw something interesting:

```
Note: If you then copy the extracted files into the Port Royale 3 Install folder - and MOVE the .fuk file to a COMPLETELY different folder ( ie. C:\ )... you can play the game without the .fuk files. Which will be usefull if you plan on trying to mod the game. Big Grin
```


try that with Railway Empire

Ye, it would be great if the author of .fuk extractor had made it so we could pack the .fuk files back togheter.

Playing without the fuk files is not possible like in PR3 game. Its not possible (after extensive testing) to just extract the files, decompress, edit, then recompress and put in a ini folder etc.

I have been testing a lot, and it does not work. 

I have tested with uncompressed original files extracted right from the fuk files, that i then put through the ingame tool that creates .fuk packaged for steam workshop. When I do it this was the game will recognise the files, becuase the game will crash. If  i put in "fake" jibberish ini files i created myself (with correct names), the game will load up into the start menu, just as it would if I remove some .fuk files. But you cant play.

I could alway try to explain more thoroughly if needed, but at the moment It does not look like many ppl are interested. 

Thx for the reply. I appreciate it!

It would be great if you write some kind of tutorial, how you do that.
I can assure you that it would be very interesting at least to me, but for sure there are many people who want to read it sometime later. The game has been released recently, and modders has't yet paid attention to it
