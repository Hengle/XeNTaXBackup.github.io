- Post Title: Monster Hunter World's Audio Files

I'm looking into modding the sound files of Monster Hunter World, but I (annoyingly) soon realized that all of the audio files are several weird formats. Here's a list of a few of them I noticed:
.wwbk
.wwpk
.wwat
.wwev
.wwct
.wwspl
.wwgp
.wwst

I have a link for one file in each of the formats. I hope someone can help me figure this one out.

Those aren't audio files, those are various Wwise accompanying files, like Wwise Area Transition Trigger (.wwat) and Wwise Event List (.wwev).
