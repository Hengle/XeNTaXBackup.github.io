- Post Title: Hot wheels World Best Driver .Brres/.Bdae files

I was wondering if there is any way to extract the .Brres and .Bdae files of Hot wheels World Best Driver.They are mainly the Texture and Model Files.Several programs are available like(.Brres Viewer) but it works with Wii games files (didnt worked with Hotwheels PC version files).
                      Is there any way to Extract these files from the PC version of the game ?
Here is the link of one of the car of that game..with both of the file formats:

here is a bms script to extract the textures from the brres files  

```
get BYTEORDER short
get SKIPZERO short
get UNK long
get BASEOFFSET long
get FILES long
math STRINGOFFSET = FILES
math STRINGOFFSET * 0x18
math STRINGOFFSET + 0x1c
get UNK long
get TOTALDATASIZE long
for i = 0 < FILES
	get UNK long
	get OFFSET long
	math OFFSET + BASEOFFSET
	get SIZE long
	getdstring SKIP 0xc
	savepos TMP
	goto STRINGOFFSET
	get NAME string
	string NAME + ".dds"
	savepos STRINGOFFSET
	log NAME OFFSET SIZE
	goto TMP
next i
```

download QuickBMS and extract the files

create a new txt file and copy the script code into it and save it.
then launch the quickbms.exe
select the new script
then select the archive to extract
then select the output folder
then click the "Save" button

i don't know about the models, the format looks too exotic/chaotic for me, there
might be a tool out there already that can open them or you could try Hex2obj.

for anyone who may find this of use. I was able to create an extractor for this game a while ago. Its not exactly complete and there are some issues with it(look at readme.txt), but its able to export all the sub-meshes as .obj files with UV coordinates.
