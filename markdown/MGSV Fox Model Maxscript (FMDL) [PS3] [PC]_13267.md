- Post Title: MGSV Fox Model Maxscript (FMDL) [PS3] [PC]

I did a quick port of what I made for Ground Zeroes to The Phantom Pain on PS3. Not complete, UV's are tempremental doesn't do bones, I've commented out those parts of the code but feel free to try the UVs as they work on some models, at this point I'd much rather play the game then fix this stuff :p so I've put it on my github if anyone wants to add to it.

EDIT: Added PC Version, which imports Models, UVs and Unskinned bones, the bone name strings arent in the model file anymore sadly so I had to comment out that code. Feel free to pull and improve.

Yeah that's a good idea, I didn't even use this on many models I really don't want to spoil any part of it. Even though I'm biased as most of my work on these forums is for mgs games this has to be one of the best games released in the past few years, it's so amazing.

I'm on vacation this week, and this game is going to end up eating all of it.

I still have a ton of decryption/model specs/etc. for MGS 2-4 that revelation sent me along with his WIP Noesis plugin, just sitting on my hard drive. It has been for months, maybe years now. I think when I finish the game, I'm going to go back and add the entire series to Noesis. Having everything in native x86 for this one should fill in any remaining gaps pretty quickly.

That's great news, the decryption parts where I generally fall short, I can only figure out simple ones, but if you need help with any of the file specs let me know, although I'm sure Revelation has got you covered. The MGS series will be a great add for Noesis' library.

Thanks for the offer. I still haven't actually dug into the materials he sent me too in-depth, but I think I should be all set. I didn't spot much in the way of animations, but I'm going to be tackling those as well. For MGS 2+3 to start, then perhaps straight to V for the aforementioned x86+debugging advantage.

That's great, I look forward to it, Revelation definitely knows what he's doing and It'll be great to have the whole series in Noesis.

I added a maxscript for the pc version to the original post which imports Models, UVs and Unskinned bones, the bone name strings arent in the model file anymore sadly so I had to comment out that code.

We need someone to take a look at the animation system for V. I'll fix up my mgs tool and publish specs on github hopefully this weekend for now.

can this pull out vehicle models? and if so does it have all the riggings so that one could,in theory put new scratch built models into the game in place of the original vehicles?

 cause Kojima said he always wanted to make a mad max game and I want to honor him by taking my mad max cars and putting them in game for all the enjoy.

Its more likely it will work with the PC script. But I haven't tried most of the files myself as I don't want to spoil anything and I have limited time to play, but try it and see if it works. But bare in mind this script is only for importing models from the game into maxscript. It can't do the reverse (convert models to fmdl and put them in game)
