Nothing wierd.

actually is very simple.

use ths script with quickbms.

```

for rip = 1 to entries
   get unk long
   get unk long
   get textsz byte
   savepos backone
   get check byte

   if check != 1 && check != 2 && check != 3
      goto backone
   endif

   savepos offset
   slog "" offset textsz utf8
   xmath next_off "(textsz + offset)"
   goto next_off
next rip

```
