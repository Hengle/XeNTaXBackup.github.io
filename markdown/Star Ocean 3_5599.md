I know I'm posting a lot of topics. I just have a lot of questions. See, when I put star ocean 3 into the dvd drive, they're no files there. I know there hidden. So, is there anyway extract said hidden files from the disc?

I don't "think" that there are any hidden files, especially not in a DVD.
There's most likely a problem with your DVD drive or the actual DVD.

Try using the ps2 emulator witht he disc if that works your pc can read the disc.
If it can read the disc make an iso of the game and that should help with the file problem.

It uses a custom TOC...you need to build a tool for extract them from the iso

Yeah, nothing's wrong with the actual disc. They're hidden most like to protect. I heard the could hidden on a separate track that a standard DVD drive cannot read. Custom TOC? I don't suppose there's a tool for that?

IsoBuster won't work.

Okay, I tired ISOBuster, and it sort of worked. I was able to get the sounds files, but no all of if.
