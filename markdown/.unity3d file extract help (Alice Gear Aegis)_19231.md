Hello.

So this is another anime style mobile game that I'm trying to extract models from.
link: [https://apps.qoo-app.com/en/app/5748/Alice+Gear+Aegis](https://apps.qoo-app.com/en/app/5748/Alice+Gear+Aegis)

After installing the game, I checked the installation folder and it's full of randomly named .unity3d files, which presumably contain models and textures.



But these files are not unpackable with any means I tried (UAE, UABE, unity studio, disunity, etc). They all return errors without extraction.
Can anyone help me on this?

For your quick try..: [https://drive.google.com/open?id=1hT4K9 ... mgHyoRU6Xk](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1hT4K9ScT22fNq-xHHR5CBImgHyoRU6Xk)

Just remove the first 32 bytes and retry your means.

Hi, thanks for your help!
Do you mean the first 32 bytes of the byte block in file header? Which program would you recommend to use to view and change it?

Any hex editor can do but if you've got a lot of files to deal with, probably you don't wanna do it manually.
Use the following BMS commands to finish the job.

```
set Name string "new\\"
string Name + ArcName
get Size asize
math Size - 0x20
log Name 0x20 Size

```

Works like a charm! Many thanks.

What program did you use to get that model after you remove the 32 bytes?

I tried Unity Studio and it worked just fine.

im having a similar issue with the unity3d files from one piece thousand storm, but this bms script doesnt seem to do it for those which means it must be a different encryption method so that sucks...back to the drawing board

Hello.

First of all, I would like to express my gratitude to all of you in this article. Let me learn the unpacking method of Alice Gear Aegis.

But I've been having a hard problem for a long time.

I would like to see the text data about Alice Gear Aegis.
I unpacked a file called actress_scenario.json.bytes from a guy called ccd3b2480e3cdb3de8e6463595baf0c5.unity3d. I checked it in notepad, but it was a bunch of files.

Just like this image shows.


How can I make it show correctly?

Delete the first 32 bytes with Bigchillghost's bms script above or in vgmtoolbox/hex editor, then the files should be working for asset studio or other unity file reader ><

This game seems to add two unknown formats than before
