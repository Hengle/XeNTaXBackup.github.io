- Post Title: New PC Port of Compile Heart's Date A Live Rio Reincarnation .pck files

A few days ago the new pc port of Compile Heart's Date A Live Rio Reincarnation has been releashed.

There files game are familiar to the PSVITA version. So I followed this thread: [viewtopic.php?t=19496](https://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?t=19496)
I tried using both pc_hyperdevotion_noire_pck.bms and CompileHeart_PSVita_pck.bms to try to extract the following PatternFade,pck file. It works if I use the PSVITA file, but won't if I use the new PC file. Can anyone help me with this problem?

PatternFade.pck [PSVITA] : [https://www.dropbox.com/s/t0exs3fll4whv ... e.pck?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/t0exs3fll4whvz4/PatternFade.pck?dl=0)

Thank you in advance

Try these. Don't forget to remove all conflicting Noesis scripts.

UPD: reimport-friendlier QBMS script.

UPD2: QBMS script for tex-to-dds; Noesis script updated for more formats supported and Sting/Aquaplus LZSS (moderately slow vs QBMS script).

Thank you TheUkrainianBard for helping me out. That script you gave worked perfectly and I appreciate your help. I have another question: Is it possible to reverse the extracting and make a repack script so you can convert .png to .tex  / packing files and folders to .pck ? 

Thank you very much

You can now try QuickBMS' reimport mode to re-pack PCKs.

I extracted MA.pck files and got some .tex files. But the Noesis doesn't support it. Do you know why?
