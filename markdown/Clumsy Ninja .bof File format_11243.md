- Post Title: Clumsy Ninja .bof File format?

So I'm trying to get the models from the free smart phone game Clumsy Ninja, but the format appears to be .bof files. I'd really like to get models from this game if possible, so if anyone knows of a tool or something that can read this format, let me know! I've included a sample of the game's format: [https://www.mediafire.com/?0zjim3w4d0p2i5s](https://www.mediafire.com/?0zjim3w4d0p2i5s)

Thanks!
