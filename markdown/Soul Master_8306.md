I don't understand how to retrieve the starting offset because there are some data ("CHAR") between the end of the file entries and the real offset... really a boring file format.

Can you post the format you have found so far? 
I'll look around for other files, or maybe parse the entire file directly.

the following, except the "skip the stupid CHAR stuff!!!" command obviously :)

```
get DUMMY long
for EXTRACT = 0 < 2
    goto 8
    get FILES long
    for i = 0 < FILES
        get NAME string
        get SIZE long
        get DUMMY long
    next i
    get DUMMY byte
    get FILES long
    for i = 0 < FILES
        get NAME string
        get SIZE long
        get DUMMY long
        if EXTRACT != 0
            log NAME OFFSET SIZE
            math OFFSET += SIZE
            savepos TMP
            goto OFFSET
            get NAME string
            savepos OFFSET
            goto TMP
        endif
    next i
    getdstring CHAR 4
    get DUMMY long

    skip the stupid CHAR stuff!!!

    savepos OFFSET
next EXTRACT
```
so it's all complete except the retrieving of the offset of the first file, it's horrible to be blocked for a so stupid thing
