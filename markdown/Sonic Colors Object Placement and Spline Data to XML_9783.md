- Post Title: Sonic Colors Object Placement and Spline Data to XML

This file seems like it should be a XML file but it seems like its been 'encrypted'. I'm wondering if anyone here can take a look at this. To see if they can make anything of this. Since I wouldn't know where to start with this.

Maybe he uses an json converter that takes XML files and turns them into some nice HTML5 output.

Well this is to Sonic Colors actually. They are the set files that make it have splines and set up object points for where objects in the game would go to trigger things just like in Unleashed and Generations. Reason being I wanted to see how they differed between the two. Since in the files it still has proper naming conventions in there. Same thing with the splines, for Grinding Rails its labedled @GR and other things. I just figured it was some type of XML that was compiled down. 

Was hoping to look at these in a Generations editing program and get some work done to fix them up and make them usable in Generations.

[http://www.sendspace.com/file/x1jwxz](http://www.sendspace.com/file/x1jwxz) heres some files from Generations for comparison to how I think the end outcome should look like if at all possible.

Besides even if it could convert back and forth that would open up the possibility for Colors modding on the Wii.

Here are some more examples.
