Zip it, make sure the extension is something like zip or rar, and then try uploading it again.

Hi mate,

It looks to me like its a 3D model rather than an archive, so we can't actually get anything out of these files.

Maybe there are some larger files with names like Sounds.xxx or Textures.xxx - if so then maybe you can find a small file with the same extension to send to us

The textures are straight DDS DXT3 with complete 128 byte DDS header. The generic DDS ripper script I wrote in Perl will rip all the textures. I haven't tried the inserter script yet but I see no reason why it won't work. The graphics in this game could use a little modding

Hey,

I have a demo of this game but I couldn't find any archives in there at all - all the files are just stored normally. So for modding, you just need to have a program that will convert the files into another format - eg convert the images into BMP images, and vice versa.
