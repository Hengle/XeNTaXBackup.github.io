Reminds me of 3 things:

GunZ (an old game, very similar, maybe some of you played it)
Resonance of Fate (PS3/360 game)
Sucker Punch (the movie)

. . . is like a rip off those 3 combined XD

From what I can see, there is no umodel support at the moment and Gildor doesn't seem interested in it, sadly.
So, unless he will decide to make this game compatible with umodel, we need to find another way to extract these models..

On the forum they say the game is generic.. but I don't know what they mean exactly. I want to extract these models (with textures, bones and weights) so badly  I hope we can use another method, like a bms script, Noesis, other...

You mean the files? Here, I packed some [http://www.mediafire.com/?c2q9yl7w1h7kcv0](http://www.mediafire.com/?c2q9yl7w1h7kcv0) (couldn't attach the archive to the post 'cause it's too big)

There's also a .udk package..

And the extracted files attached here:

An army of ninja killers were convinced me that this game is not worser than some other games which I've already supported 
I have some free time now, so I can work on this game support. By the way, I've checked this game today and found that everything is already supported, except textures. So, "umodel -notex" should work. For reversing texture formats I'll need to get unprotected game executable (the one I've got has unknown protection).

By the way guys, if you have the game, could you check the models? It seems some textures are missing and also is it just me, or there are only 3 characters?

From some of the gameplay videos I think that's how many characters there are lol
You can probably dress them up with different outfits (if they actually designed such customization).

No I think a lot is missing. Some textures first of all, then at least 2 characters (the Babydoll one and the guy in the trailer). Is this client the complete version or is it a demo?

Gildor really hates the aesthetic of most korean games. Can't blame him really. Since they do all end up looking the same.

Korean and Chinese game companies are developing hundreds of games. Most of them are not suitable for non-local market (often they even have no English name). The difference between such games are minimal (at least when I'm looking at screenshots). So I don't feel that I must support all of them. Some Asian games were supported in umodel only because this work were sponsored. For the current moment I got almost no sponsorship for the recent year, so everything were made just by requests (or when I think that the game is meaningful enough).
What's the most asked question on my forum for such games? "Where I can download client?". I think that's because these games are difficult to be located via google (and of course because of some laziness of forum visitors ) This could be treated as value of the game notability. Check "Gunslayer legend" in the google. You'll find my forum and this thread on the 1st place and no link to the real game page.

True, because the game's title wasn't translated yet. The site is all in Chinese and I don't even know how it's actually called XD
By the way I still think models look cool, maybe because they used original characters as reference, like Babydoll.
