- Post Title: Injustice 2 Sounds

Hi all,

Is it possible to extract the sounds from the .xxx files in Injustice 2? I've managed to decompress the .xxx (with ue3_oodle.bms) files but nothing seems to open them. Revali Game Tools shows 16 WEM files, but when I extract and convert they don't play (I also thought there would be more so thinking it can't be right!).

I believe Injustice 2 doesn't work with Unreal Package Extractor by Glidor, but am I missing a trick here? I'm looking particularly for the in game sounds - get hit noises, attack sounds, round win quotes etc, as all the intros/banter is readily available already

Thanks

Can you post an example of one of the files?

Sure thing, I've attached one of the game files (had to zip as didn't like the file format)

Actually I'm not sure but it looks like the Sound files are stored in .afc files and I don't believe the bms script can extract them
