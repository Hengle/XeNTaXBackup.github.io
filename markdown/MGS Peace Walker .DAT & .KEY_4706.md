- Post Title: MGS: Peace Walker .DAT & .KEY

I've been trying to figure this one out, most of the others are just zlibbed, but the slot.dat has a coresponding slot.key, and doesnt decompress with zlib.

the slot.dat is 500mb, so It's cutted, I included the whole key file as its 25kb.  (quite large for a decryption key?)
