- Post Title: PS2/PSP MWo3 files

Hey there,

I do translations for PS2 and PSP games and recently I stumbled upon MWo3 files which are used in PS2 and PSP games.
Does anyone know about that type of format and how to make it more editable?
I can translate them via Hex Editor, but have to deal with the character limit (it is JP - ENG translation).

Here are two examples: [http://vuvu.bplaced.net/PSP/Text.zip](http://vuvu.bplaced.net/PSP/Text.zip)

Kind regards
