Hi guys,

I have a question, I was able to decompress the pxp files of the game using the code from [viewtopic.php?f=10&t=10182](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=10182)
But I was unable to recompress them back, if anyone would be able to provide a code, or a method to do so I would greatly appreciate it.
Here is an example of the pxp file I am trying to decompress with the .dll from the thread I mentioned [http://www.mediafire.com/download/zw6ny ... eStorm.rar](http://www.mediafire.com/download/zw6nyrb8nh0p1d9/CastleStorm.rar)
