CTR-tools is a toolset for PS1 game Crash Team Racing.
Github: [https://github.com/DCxDemo/CTR-tools](https://github.com/DCxDemo/CTR-tools)

Currently you can:

- extract and rebuild BIGFILE.BIG, human readable filenames and folder structure included
- extract levels in OBJ format featuring medium texture quality
- extract static models and import untextured models back in the game
- extract samples in VAG/WAV formats and music tracks in MIDI format from KART.HWL
- edit level vram textures
- edit localization files
- minor Crash Bash support: unpack CRASHBSH.DAT from various CB builds and extract textures

r8 released, mid LOD now textured.

about fonts, it's tricky. this is the same texture page with 2 different palettes applied. as you can see they use same texture for 2 characters.

Nice  Fortunately, the small font stays the same, so editing only the small one may be a workaround in some cases. 
Any chance for adding new characters to font VRAM image and font description file?

Btw you can see how russians did their translations by comparing files from BIGFILE.

Do not tell people they have to join Discord to gain access to tools for file formats. Post the tools directly here. It's fine if you suggest to have the person join Discord in addition to that.

released r12, most notably in this release, we're able to load custom untextured PLY model into the game now.

A video for the earlier version when vertex color wasn't supported yet:

this is focused on Crash Team Racing for PS1. you can't use it with Crash Nitro Kart.
