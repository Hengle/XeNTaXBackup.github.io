- Post Title: Pinball FX3 .pxt Model Ripping?

I got these models (i think) of Bob from the Bob's Burgers Pinball table from Pinball FX3 and I want to how if its possible to convert it to anything.

I don't really need the skeleton of the model I just need the model, textures, and uv data.

I got the model files here and I think the .pxa is the texture file.

Thanks in advance!

Apparently, these files need to be decompress take a look at this [topic](https://zenhax.com/viewtopic.php?f=9&t=497&sid=7c99e49eeadfbf93c36d026fbd58aed5&start=20), the script does not work with the samples you posted.
