- Post Title: MX vs ATV .trn files (PC)

This applies to MvA and MXU. From what we can tell, .trn files are another compressed file. If we could open this file it would lead to great things with this game. It would be much appreciated if you could get a plugin working for this file 

I cant attached a .trn file for you the file size is too big 
if you want a copy let me know ill send u one.

Cheers

Tim.

Hey guys, I believe the .trn files have at least 3 files in there, a height map, texture map and a friction map.

Here's a file for you to look at:

THIS FILE NEEDS TO BE LEFT ALONE! will lead to nothing but stealing tracks. Why would you even want in those? Only reason would be stealing. We already have enough guys ripping stuff off. As far as I know Bruce is the only one that can do this (and only in mcm) ..but Bruce is a guy that can be trusted, Hes one of the most old school dudes in mcm community.

I for 1 will stop releasing tracks to the public when people have the ability to steal 3 months of work and use it for themselves. Only the guys i ride online with will have my tracks.

No it's not. Don't forget that there are a lot people at this forum who haven't even heard of MX/MCM/ATV and the like. Enlighten those (including me, because I too have no idea what's the problem here).

Yeah.. my bad.. my message was targeted to those that are comin here for mcm/mxvsatv info. (Clint-Ghetto_cR)

i didnt think their was a problem till i got the "what the hell" comment from a mod. thought that was a little uncalled for.

The trn file stores. a few files that i feel (and i know im not the only) dont need to be opened by anyone other then the files creator. Both the displacement (height map) and the terrain textures (dont really care if people can get that out) are in that file. 

the MCM community has already been through the people stealing others skins and objects and claiming them as their own ( i never had this problem since i dont make skins or objects) but i saw what it did to the people that were effected. I just dont want to see the same thing happen with the actual tracks. Many track creators have spent alot of time developing their tracks and i know that many of them dont want their tracks being peiced together in someone else's track. I think it has the chance to drive away whats left of the good content creators for the game.

So, you come to the XeNTaX forums, actively participate in extracting other types of files, but now that your own content gets semi-exposed, you 'feel' that people shouldn't do that. How's that for a double standard?

We're not going to give special treatment to members who have certain feelings about certain files. You don't get to decide which files are examined or not, and you certainly don't get to play police officer about it.

And just to make one thing clear: we don't condone or encourage plagiarism. There isn't much we can do about it though, so I would suggest you follow your own advice and stop exposing your content to the internet.

come on guys, dont argue. i think if an issue needs to be addressed it should be addressed in a way that can help both sides understand the issue at hand. 
I think smokn was saying something that would be good for mva community, but we need to be able to explain it  to the extremely helpful folks here why that is. I think smokn wasnt so worried about his own content being exposed, but anyone who has created a user map. On the other hand however, bringing up Captains side, if someone wants to ask for help on a file, whos to say that he cant have access to it. So, i feel that people should be open about  what they find.
thanks for being so helpful btw guys! you guys rock!

I don't see a point in fighting over a game. O_o... This can only lead to flaming, and possibly already has.

Edit: Though if it is just a track file, then what could you do with it?

Whatever the issue, what we don't do here is calling each other names, ocr_smokngrn. Consider this a warning. 

It appears that you are spilling rivality from the MCM community onto the XeNTaX board. We have nothing to do with your community, nor do we wish to take side in any feuds within that community. 

People who steal stuff will always exist. They are laughed at by the world. If someone created something new, he should spread this in his community for all to see. Then all will know who it was that created it and thiefs will easily be exposed.  

That said, if some one wants to know what this .TRN format is all about, we're here to see if we can help out.

He's right, it's just like art and all that. I had problems with people stealing sprites from a friend of mine, but we were able to expose him and won the little conflict.

The main reason I want to look into the terrain files is converting tracks from MXU (Preqeul to MvA on XBOX and PS2 only) to MvA... and how the f*ck would people steal displacementmaps or textures? They'd have to make the exact same track... kinda pointless. And even if they would do that they'd get banned from the community's upload sites...

Laurie created a utility to do this and he has left it up to me to decide when I extract a dispmap or texture from a trn file.  I have done it for several people when they have lost a dispmap and wanted to recreate the track (either to make it better or for a newer game).  We can do it for all the TRN games (mcm, mcm2, mxu, and mva).

There is no need to extract the disp and tex from the trn to convert an MXU track to MVA.

We at Twisted DIRT made the decision a long time ago to not make a utility that extracts dispmaps and textures available to the public.  We have recovered files for individuals though.  It's hard to do for people I don't know.   

It has been my opinion that for the most part if you want someone elses dispmap for whatever reason you can ask.

One time I did post an image of the dispmap of BaatKips SX 2000 and someone made it and released it for MCM 2 before I did.  I wasn't very happy about it because it was a lower res image than the real dispmap and the track wasn't as good as it should have been.

I'm always torn about this kind of stuff. I've thought of making a plugin for MultiEX so it supports MCM 2.  A utility that extracted the stuff in the TRN would make me not want to do it.  I don't want people converting any of my stuff before I do it.

Thieves wil be thieves. There is no reason to claim sole right to extract from TRN files. There is no reason to prohibit others to want to do it. 

This forum's aim is to share knowledge. Not keep it to one's self.

You can voice your opinions all you want. Just don't saddle us with other forum's bullshit drama. Is that so hard to understand?

I do appreciate what the people at this site do.  We (Twisted DIRT) have always shared knowledge.  We also don't tell 100% of what we figure out.  

There are times we want to do certain things and telling others about it would make it where we couldn't do it.  Converting MXU tracks to MCM 2 is a good example.  TD figured it out, TD wanted to do it, and it took time to do it. 

I am in now way trying to stop anyone from doing this.  I am just pointing out that it really isn't necessary to figure it out.

Okay, so I looked at the TRN files briefly, and it seems it starts with a small header. 

This is followed by a 256 colour palette, probably for some graphics in there. This palette is 0x400 in size (so alpha-r-g-b, 4 bytes per colour). 

The alpha is always 0xFF, implicating probably that no alpha is used in the graphics. 

Then come, as it looks like, 0xd50 sized sections, that in all probability contain some mapping info. This is quite obscure yet, perhaps others can figure it out. 

I haven't looked any further, will take a look some other time again. I invite others to take a look at it as well. There should be some textures in there (Strobe?). 

It's a shame that we have to reinvent the wheel, though, as the format is already known.

Hi Mousie mousie =D

I just made a quick look on it, and it doesnt look so advanced.
i think you are right about the palette data. but some parts
of the file is structured in a 16 bit way. either its sounds, or 16 bit graphics,
or just some sort of data in 16 bit. ill have too look closer later,
ive been busy as hell these last 2 week configuration shit
and even working a bit. "WOOHOOO", i have not forgot you guys though =D

I wouldn't say the format is known.  Laurie has figured out how to extract the dispmap, textures, and friction map and re-insert them, but doesn't know enough to create one from scratch.  

We asked Rainbow for info about the file format and they wouldn't help, even though they expect that Laurie will be updating his Dillo 2 track editor for MXvsATV (which he is) to provide features that they did not put in the MXvsATV editor.

There is no need to extract the disp and tex from the trn to convert an MXU track to MVA.

Well for me it is... meybe you find an easier way to this but when I re-import the spline (origanal or new made) it makes you and AI ride in circles so I want at least the displacement map to make a new spline.

I've figured out alot of stuff no-one else knew about like particles, funnel blockers, or friction zones that clean your bike... and have gotten a very good understanding of how this game works by now. 

And I heard you where working on coversion to so I stopped with mine and asked Stephen if I could help over a month ago, and he'd talk to one of you guys (don't know who of you are doing conversions) if I could help but I never heard anything from him since... so here-by I offer my services to help.
