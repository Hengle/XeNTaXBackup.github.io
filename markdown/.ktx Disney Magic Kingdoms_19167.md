Hi, can someone help me with this .ktx format from this game, i already tried to open it with PVRTexTool and Mali Texture Compression Tool but nothing works, this is new because before this new update the format was .pvr now it has changed.
Thanks in advance  .

Your samples use ASTC compression. PVRTexTool works fine, make sure you have properly set up "astcenc.exe" in your PATH variable.

i've never been able to get PVRTexTool to find astcenc.exe,
it doesn't seem to matter the exe version, location, ran as admin etc. 
i use Win 7 x64 SP1 Pro

Delete the "astcenc.exe" part, you just need to add the folder path. Also make sure the paths in your "PATH" variable are separated with ";".
