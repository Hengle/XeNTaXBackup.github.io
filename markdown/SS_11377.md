Here's maxscript for this game (if someone interested) imports models with bones+weights. Need some testings with models, if there will be any errors let me know

EDIT: There was weight-line error - fixed

> With this script I imported models from your last sample, you should try itwell I looking all your scripts, and now I got why not working, because you have added unicode support, you rename files to test, so for this reason it load, but is a pain test files like this, because in this case need rename every time to see if load or not, you can't add unicode support? because if we don't change the name of models, bones we got this undefined function, ok many thanks Zaramot, take care.

PS: anyway textures are not assgined to model too.

I think is not my issue, is yours with something you have doing there, anyway thanks a lot for trying keep updating threads, you doing a great job, take care.
