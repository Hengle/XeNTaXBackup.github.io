Hey Guy's! so i've been wondering about the HOTD2 format and it seems the majority of the models / textures are in these archives / formats called ".bin"'s and i'm almost for certain the ones in these folders ARE the textures and models, the only problem is finding out the headers or how to extract said models & textures, would anyone be willing to give this a try / go? thank you! ;D

.pol seem to be the files that store Mesh data:

Here you will find a quickbms script for the .bin Archives

Some good stuff! it seems those scripts are mainly used for compression and such, a few of the .TEX'S ARE viewable, but i'm looking more towards the models WITH the textures aswell xP

That's all great stuff, but i was hoping someone would eventually decompress it all, and try to extract a model or two from the game xP

Perfect timing. I just posted this yesterday. I even referenced that same video before even seeing this board.

WHOA!! LOL, so you made that script yourself?? that's fuckin awesome man!! yeah i actually didn't know the .BIN files can be unpacked n stuff untill just recently when i found out that they could! but your script looks incredible, especially with the models that have the correct UVW n stuff!!   




ninja ripper did the job 0oookay but nothing like you did ;D it seriously sucked fucking ASS trying to rearrange the models AND reset the UVW's on them, total pain in the ass man lol, but with your script n all, i actually wouldn't mind re-arranging the models from scratch just aslong as they DO have the correct UVW's, that'd be nothin

I want to say about a year and a half (on and off). There's another HotD2 board on here that I last replied to around Dec of 2018.  I also posted some prelim stuff back in Nov last year on the Discord.  But it wasn't until the latest Blender update, which included a math node to help with the mirroring of textures, that finally made my work worthy enough of finally posting.

My lua script takes advantage of pvrtextool to extract the textures into usable png files; it's still not perfect but it's a solid start.  The UV's are accurate (for the most part) but I feel your pain about manually reworking UV's.  Long ago for the HotD1 maps, I tried manually correcting the UV's and I gave up on the first tree lol, albeit that was over 3 years ago when I was still an ultra-n00b.

I'll PM you Reddance if you want to collab on trying out a few of the models.  Just let me know which ones.
