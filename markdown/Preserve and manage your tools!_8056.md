- Post Title: Preserve and manage your tools!

Making a tool available for everyone is nice but will you maintain it after some months?
Probably not.

Then all the work goes 404 together with the filehoster (hurray for 90 day limits)
or your own webpage (you probably won't have it forever) and is lost.

Preserve it for everyone!
Put tools on open source code repositorys like github or Google Code for everyone to improve
or test/learn/use themselves. (and choose the right LICENSE so it doesn't get kicked off too easy)

It's free and easy to use (don't expect to understand git or svn in 5 minutes though)
Additionally you can easily collaborate: Want to take a game apart together?
There is no faster way to see a tool update than a commit on the source repository.
Then discuss it here on XeNTaX to find people that are interested in your work.

(if you want to see what it looks like: Repository for 'Tales of' games)
Github: [Tales of the tools](http://github.com/0xFAIL/Tales-of-the-Tools) (yay for shameless self promotion)

Do you want a tutorial how to do so?
Write below what you think about it.




Sorry this sounds like an advertisement. It is for a good cause

Yeah, I agree with this. Even if the person does not want to make the tool open source, they could at least document it so others could learn from that.

Some guys seem to believe that since they did it from scrath by themselves, everyone should do the same (although they obviously have learned from many other people's work).
But the protection schemes tend to get more and more complex so if starters have ro reinvent the wheel everytime things will go much slower than they are now.

I toss mine on skydrive and dropbox.
But ya putting on a repository of tools would be useful.
