- Post Title: EA sports - Tiger woods PGA Tour 2008 model and animation

hello everyone, i was curious about 3d model and animation of Tigerwoods PGA tour and Age of empire3 ,  Fortunately i have got help for AoE3 model from this site   
but i couldn't find out any thread in the perspective of Tigerwoods PGA Tour series

im not a programer i just design 3d art and game modding which is graphics

i need help you guys especially have experienced guys in EA Sports game's 3d model   

i'd like to give every informations to here about Tiger woods game and 3d models and graphics
which i can do everything

Curently TW2008 is the newest title, but basicly there is no different form earlier titles (2007and 2006) they are uses same 3d and texture format 
so i think it could not complex in the numbers of file types

ok then i'd like to give links in the perspective of Tigerwoods PGA Tour for your researching

- you can get TW2008 demo if u need test and digging the game files and dlls

- there is an official level editor from EA to make 3d environment of golf course
and they support tools to converting texture and Geometry models for level editor
if u needs some reference about Geometry model file you can get static model exporter(max script) for 3dsmax
[http://www.jimbo64.com/tutorials/Intro_to_max.html](http://www.jimbo64.com/tutorials/Intro_to_max.html) ( the thrid link in there you can get Max and Gmax export scripts )

ok then i tell you about TW2008 file structure  in the perspective 3d model and animations
i looked around of files i figured out a little bit about character model and animations

The game files aren't archived no compressed. the character models and animations in
- Data\Golfers\  there are 3 directoires "charcsd" "CHARS" "CHARTEX"
i think "CHARS" is put the models and animations, "CHARTEX" is put the Textures for models
but im not sure i just suppose like that

In CHARS directory,
 there are .xbx files i think this .xbx file is model and animations achive file 
which is compressed
thre are numbers of characters and motins and other stuffs

In CHARTEX directory,
there are .fxx files and i think this file has compressed

and im not sure about charcsd directory what is types for the game character
I could tell the informations so far about TW2008 
i linked sameple files for your reseach

[http://www.savefiles.net/d/8b3d5bnxh5e4.html](http://www.savefiles.net/d/8b3d5bnxh5e4.html)

I hope that i could put new golfers as The celebrity and non-human characters  
and change golf club as the base ball bat or the broomstick and many other funny stuffs 
if could make then would be funny

if someone take this research i'll thanks a lot, you guys could not makes work though

thanks
