You can use "JPEXS Free Flash Decompiler" to edit such files
and then hex editor to insert edited data into UPK.


There's even a tutorial for that [viewtopic.php?t=24559](https://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?t=24559)

> but is that for gfx file but my file is cfx file

That doesn't make any difference. GFX is basically the same as CFX (with few minor exceptions).
Read more about format similarities here [http://wiki.xentax.com/index.php/Macrom ... leform_GFX](http://wiki.xentax.com/index.php/Macromedia_Flash_SWF_/_Scaleform_GFX)

And swfmovie is only a container as described here [http://wiki.xentax.com/index.php/Unreal_Engine_SWFMOVIE](http://wiki.xentax.com/index.php/Unreal_Engine_SWFMOVIE)
