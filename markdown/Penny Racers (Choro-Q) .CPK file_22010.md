I attached a link to the .CPK files where I hope to find 3D models for the cars.
Can you guys have a look at it?

I've tried to use this quickbms script, that is supposed to extract multiple versions of .cpk files:


 cpk.zip
.CPK quickbms script from Aluigi (2.5 KiB) Downloaded 14 times



Hope the script and my error_log helps
