Hi, first post :p

Its seems someone was able to extract the 3D models from FF13, with textures ect. I see from the screens that he is using Metasequoia for viewing the models...

Here's the link: [http://blog.livedoor.jp/htmk73/archives/2347812.html](http://blog.livedoor.jp/htmk73/archives/2347812.html)

I though that the PS3 discs where encrypted ? I actually ripped the full disc on my PC using the PS3 linux, and tryed to watch the CG cutscenes, but it seems that all the files are encrypted (because the header of each movie file is different, so I think that there is some sort of encryption right ?)

So, is there a tool to decrypt PS3 disc ? can someone that speaks japanese better than me actually go to that blog and get some infos regarding the extraction of the models ? (and the CG, that would be great !)

I'm pretty sure the X360 version would be easier to...unlock?

Yep, but now that the info is spreeding on the web, I'm pretty sure they will change the code for the x360 version...

PS3 discs are encrypted.  And then certain files within the disc are even encrypted again in addition to that.  The first layer of encryption is easy to remove though if you have access to the right hardware.  Of course, companies are also welcome to do whatever else they want to their own files, such as encrypting or compressing them after that if they want.  But most file are completely fine after the first layer of disc based encryption is removed. And, no, a retail ps3 is not currently capable of doing these things.

Hopefully i can get access to some of the game files at some point to attempting looking into them as well.

i would also be surprised if the release delay for other countries was anything more than being due to region/country preference and audio recording/language translation at this point.  2 months is hardly time to do much more than bug fixes and regional updates, much less change the file format for all the game files, re-export them, test them, master game discs, and hit dvd/bluray production schedules for a pending international release.  Though i guess if they really care all that much about it they could put some measures in place, but i don't think it would even be worth the time or effort required, especially since it wouldn't change the current discs available.  Though i am sure there are enough hardware differences and graphics api differences, that depending on this new engine they made for the game works, could cause some file format differences.

Yes, it really seems that the disc are encrypted, but I saw that some files are not, like the png for the icons and the trophy list, I can even see the description of the trophies ...

Anyway, here's the response of the guy :

ファイルの抽出方法はPS3S○Kなどがあると思いますが具体的な方法は秘密にしておきます。
これによってPS3市場がPSPのようなことになる可能性があるからです。

I think that he has used the PS3 SDK tools, but I don't know if its just the SDK that was spreeding on the net and working on PC, or if its a debug console that he used... (harder to get -.- )

The guy released the images to show that he did it...thats all...He didnt release the file formats, how he did it aside from purely saying "SDK" and "decrypted", obviously the guy has a few tools that we dont have here, ontop of which they wouldnt make the edits to the file formats before the western release...its too time consuming anyways.

Also...Theat livedoor.jp isnt actually the guy that did its blog...thats just some other blog with a few of the images from his blog, he took down his blog yesterday morning because of the number of hits it suddenly got when kotaku announced they'd randomally come across his blog, so he likely took it down so he doesnt get either A: arrested (software stuffs taken pretty seriously in Japan....) or B: threatend with arrest.

Everyone keeps saying "modding is possible?"...its ALWAYS possible...it just gets harder...sure its not so easy to hack the PS3 discs because they are encrypted...but still...somewhere...someone has managed it without the SDK...it probably took him a shit hell of a long time to do it though, and its also possible the encryption method for PS3 discs could change. It just takes someone with the disc 100% ripped to their HD in order to get really into it, Linux on your PPS3 would help a great deal, if you could dual boot it somehow then you could capture the cache and all the changes going on (similar to recording a PC software install) and then sit down and learn from there...wouldnt be easy...I sure as hell couldnt ever do it...but someone can:P

Though I am curious why everyone wants to mod FF13...its a console game...either you mod your console and never play online or you just do it with a pc game (which FF13 isnt) so its more just ripping models and textures as opposed to modding really.

Good thing is, PS3 is hacked and i hope it takes only short time before they dump bios and find some exploit. After that we can dump memory while playing

Wow, amasing job, too bad I don't (and will never) have a debug console T.T

Any chance you could share some completed models ? In priority : Lightning, for example -.-

That's really a shame I have bought the game at full price and can't even extract the models myself... btw, I'm curious about something : the movies are also encrypted (there is a folder "movie" of about 31 GB), are you able to watch the files on your PC with your debug console ?

That's really mean to tease us like that *cry*

Just kidding, great job ! As always 

Just wandering, how many polys in this character ? I saw in Ninja gaiden 2 almost 80.000 polygones in the main characters... the current gen consoles are really monsters -.-

Here's a sample from the X360 version, 2 files, that seems to be the 3d model + textures of one character.

Can you please share the structure informations you managed to guess for these 2 file types ? I could use that to code my own converters.

Thanks in advance

I don't know, this script is specific to the new White Engine by Square Enix, and I think that the only game released that use this engine is FF13... (I'm pretty sure Versus 13 will use it too)

The data in Final Fantasy 13 is not in tri-strip form, they are indexed triangle lists.

Hope it helps.

Don't mind the structure names.  They are overly descriptive since i was naming them as i was deciphering the data in the file.  But that should help you with the structure of the STMS section.  i still have the textures to do myself as well, as soon as time permits.

```
	for (iDeclEntry = 0; iDeclEntry < declCount; ++iDeclEntry)
	{
		switch (vertexDecl[iDeclEntry].usage)
		{
		case 0:
			iVertex = iDeclEntry;
			break;
		case 2:
			iNormal = iDeclEntry;
			break;
		case 8:
			iTexture = iDeclEntry;
			break;
		case 0xF:
			iIndices = iDeclEntry;
			break;
		case 0xE:
			iWeights = iDeclEntry;
			break;
		}
	}

Texture chunk headers (the trb files are all laid out as generic resource lists and include original file names and extensions of each resource, so you should probably iterate them correctly to get to the appropriate resource types):

```
{
	BYTE			id[8];
	int				unknownA;
	int				unknownB;
	int				texSize; //seems like original size, does not include padding
	int				unknownC[7];
	int				unknownD;
	int				unknownE[3];
} txbHdr_t;
typedef struct gtexHdr_s
{
	BYTE			id[4];
	WORD			unknownA;
	BYTE			imgFmt;
	BYTE			numMips;
	WORD			unknownC;
	WORD			width;
	WORD			height;
	WORD			unknownD;
	int				unknownE;
	int				unknownF;
} gtexHdr_t;
```


For 360 files, members of gtex are all big endian, while txb members are little endian. Following the gtex header are offsets into the image bundle for each texture and the total size of the texture + mips (including padding), also in big endian. An offset exists for each mip level, although strangely the offsets are all the same instead of pointing to each mip as you would expect.

I'm currently writing a dxt data untiler that will work universally across block sizes and image resolutions. However, I cannot believe no one has done this yet, since linking to 360 XDK libs is obviously not reasonable for most apps.

Has anyone already done this? If so, I'd really appreciate you sharing your code, ideally before I finish mine. This is a pain in the ass and I do not want to re-invent the wheel if I don't have to. 

Edit: Oh well, already finished the untiler.  Also noticed unknownB was the image format, so far have only seen values of 3 and 24.

@revelation: 
thank you, you saved me quite some time.
few questions:
is MESH_STMS_DECL-offset the offset to locate the vertex/uv/normals/etc inside the dataBytes array? 
if so, are uv and normals stored as signed 16 bit integers per component? do uv have some particular encoding?
This is what i got from face uvs (scaled down and inverted coords):
[](http://i41.tinypic.com/vzvgox.png)

@MrAdults:
thank you! do you already have some working code for the textures?

Tying textures to shaders is tricky.  Almost all the bundles have their own custom shader variants, with textures mapped to different samplers, so the only way to be 100% correct would be to decode/interpret the 360 pixel shader byte code (I don't plan to tackle this, way too much effort). Luckily the textures are named such that you can usually guess pretty well - 'C' in name is diffuse, 'N' in name is normal, 'G' in name is opacity (along with some other info in other channels).

You can get the string to tie each mesh to a shader by looking at the "STR\0" chunks inside the model file (they come in between the stms and other data in there, along with NAME which specifies surface names presumably).

Also, you might find this useful, this converts all the data types I've come across for vertices thus far into 32-bit little endian floats (sorry for inefficiencies/sloppiness, but you get the point). kekko, this should answer your question about the uv's - they are 16-bit floats in most files.

```
{
	WORD			unknownA;
	WORD			elemOfs;
	int				dataType;
	int				elemNum;
	WORD			type;
	WORD			unknownC;
} wrbStmsDataDef_t;

//convert to float
static void Model_TRB_ConvertVertDataToFloat(int numVerts, float *dst, int dstNum, BYTE *srcData, int srcStride, wrbStmsDataDef_t *dataDef)
{
	BYTE *base = (BYTE *)dst;
	for (int i = 0; i < numVerts; i++)
	{
		float *dstFl = (float *)(base + i*sizeof(meshIntrVert_t));
		BYTE *src = srcData + srcStride*i + dataDef->elemOfs;

		if (dataDef->dataType == 1)
		{ //straight up yo
			float *w = (float *)src;
			for (int j = 0; j < dstNum && j < dataDef->elemNum; j++)
			{
				float e = w[j];
				LITTLE_BIG_SWAP(e);
				dstFl[j] = e;
			}
		}
		else if (dataDef->dataType == 2)
		{ //16-bit floats
			WORD *w = (WORD *)src;
			for (int j = 0; j < dstNum && j < dataDef->elemNum; j++)
			{
				WORD e = w[j];
				LITTLE_BIG_SWAP(e);
				//dstFl[j] = (float)e;
				//dstFl[j] /= 65535.0f;
				dstFl[j] = Math_GetFloat16(e);
			}
		}
		else if (dataDef->dataType == 6)
		{ //byte
			char *w = (char *)src;
			for (int j = 0; j < dstNum && j < dataDef->elemNum; j++)
			{
				dstFl[j] = (float)w[j];
				dstFl[j] /= 127.0f;
			}
		}
		else if (dataDef->dataType == 4)
		{ //short
			short *w = (short *)src;
			for (int j = 0; j < dstNum && j < dataDef->elemNum; j++)
			{
				short e = w[j];
				LITTLE_BIG_SWAP(e);
				dstFl[j] = (float)e;
				dstFl[j] /= 32768.0f;

			}
		}
		else

			printf("Unknown data type: %i\n", dataDef->dataType);
			return;
		}
	}
}

```

Well, good luck.

As with what MrAdults and i have posted you are safer interpreting the decl[aration] structure information (my MESH_STMS_DECL is the same structure as wrbStmsDataDef_s).  The offsets are relative to the beginning of each vertex.  The vertex size is present in the STMS header information, or can be calculated from the vertex declaration structures.  The code i posted combined with the code by MrAdults should allow you interpret both data type and usage information (i only posted the main identifiers needed in most cases, there are others present in the file as well).  My code for handling the data types is pretty much identical, except type 6 is treated as an unsigned 8-bit integer since it is usually used for blend indices.  It's always interesting seeing how code created entirely in isolation of someone else comes out so similar.

As was mentioned the file appears to be mostly a block based format, and i assume the SEDB tags are something akin to Square-Enix Data Block, but that is just a guess.

MrAdults:  i would also be interested in what you have worked on regarding the texture conversion if you wouldn't mind sharing?

i hope to get to the animation and physics data at some point, but will have to see how it goes.

Yeah, I guess after all, there are only so many ways to correctly interpret the same data.  As for the bone index data, I noticed it too, and it didn't make sense, but neither did types 3 and 6 both covering the same data type. I initially had them reversed, but normals appeared to behave correctly as unsigned bytes instead of signed bytes, unexpectedly.

I haven't worked with the bone index data yet or taken an in-depth look at it, but I had the thought that 128 (or something below it) is their max bone count for each mesh segment, and so, it wouldn't matter if they used a signed byte.

As for my work on textures, sure, happy to share. For the untiling, though, my own algorithm appeared to have unexpected problems on dxt5 (noticed it on Sazh's 'fro), and after debugging it for an hour, I decided to switch to an assembly translation from a questionable source and temporarily move on. I'd rather not post either routine in its current form (the latter is of questionable legality, and not suited to be distributed in anyone's application), but once I get a chance to fix either one up, I will.

For the rest of the texture data, well, all DXT data seems to be 2-byte endian swapped regardless of the block size (so 2-byte swap is appropriate for both dxt1 and dxt5). In the structure I posted before, "imgFmt" can also be 26 (in addition to 3 == raw, 24 == dxt1), which is dxt5. I've opened most of the bundles in the game now and have still only seen 3, 24, and 26, though. I made a wild guess that 25 is dxt3, but have yet to find a bundle that puts this to the test.

3 seems to be 4 byte RGBA, although I really wanted it to be 3-byte RGB.  It's hard to tell, though, since all the raw textures I can find appear to just be linear ramp textures probably used for pixel shader lighting gradients or something. For raw pixel data, looks like it's appropriate to endian swap by the pixel size, but this could be wrong.

As mentioned, a quick and dirty method to determine the "type" of texture map is to look for capital 'C', 'N', 'G', etc. characters in the name. On that note, texture names can be reliably found in the second 0-type bundle Resource chunk, which seems to reliably be the last resource chunk in the file (preceding it is...I guess the extensions for the texture names). Every name is 16 bytes long with 0's for padding.

Before I go on, I should mention: For 360 files, the general rule is, all SEDB headers and associated info are little endian, but once you get into the contents of each SEDB, all data and headers are big endian. This holds true for everything in the texture and shader resources.

So then there is the SEDBshd resource. You need to handle that to get the information needed to actually tie mesh surfaces to textures. It's parsed out in a way totally identical to WRB (models). To get the material name, you can get the name out of the first "FILE" and truncate it at the last "_". This is again totally haphazard, but seems to be reliable for the 50-100 or so files I've tried opening with the technique.

The other important chunk type in SEDBshd is PRAM, unless of course you want to tackle actually interpreting and re-implementing compiled pixel/vertex shaders, in which case it's all important.  But anyway, the contents of PRAM, after the start of the standard 16-byte header, are like this:

```
{
	WORD				unknownA;
	WORD				unknownB;
	int					unknownC;
	int					unknownD;
	int					unknownE;
	int					unknownF;
	int					numTextures;
	int					sampleDataOfs;
	int					sampleDataEnd;
	int					ofsTableEnd;
} trbPramHdr_t;

```

Now, in reality, those unknowns are actually offsets to parts of the PRAM chunk, and the "ends" are also just more offsets, which are followed by even more offsets. But for the purpose of getting to the meat in here (the internal texture name references used by each sampler), I've named/laid out the structure like this.

So each offset/end is an offset relative to the PRAM chunk base, which starts immediately after the 16 byte PRAM chunk header. Knowing that, we can iterate the sampler data like this:

```
	int subOfs = pramBase + pramHdr.sampleDataOfs;
	while (subOfs < pramBase+pramHdr.sampleDataEnd)
	{
		int dataOfs = *((int *)(base+subOfs));
		LITTLE_BIG_SWAP(dataOfs);
		subOfs += 4;
		BYTE *checkData = base + pramBase + dataOfs;
		if (checkData[0] == 0x02 && checkData[1] == 0x01)
		{
			//ok, we have a valid sampler data entry!
		}
	}

```

Once you get to the sampler data, you can skip 32 bytes ahead, parse the first string, parse the second string (variable length, parse to 0 terminators), and the third string is your texture name reference corresponding to the texture resource names! This is all again totally haphazard but again appears totally reliable across files.

To match a texture to a name, search for the name in-order in the texture name list (the one with 16-byte entries). The index corresponds to the actual SEDBtxb your parsed out of the file in the order in which it was parsed (from beginning to end).

So now you have your shaders with their reference names, your meshes with their shader name references (which matches the corresponding shader reference name), and your shaders know which textures belong to their samplers. With this, you have all you need to render the model with appropriate surface matches.

Man, that was a pain in the ass to type up. Unfortunately it all requires a bit of actual explanation, being the haphazard process that it is, so I can't just throw code snippets/structures around.  If anyone notices that I missed something here regarding concrete ways to determine the right texture maps for each job, though, do let me know. I didn't look hard, assuming that since the pixel/vertex shaders were embedded themselves, such info would not be needed by the actual game, and so that's "just the way things are".

revelation: Turns out signed is correct for the bone indices, -1 is used for all "unused" weights on a vert. This data looks very much structured for PS3 SPE transforms instead of for a vertex shader. Actually, I suppose the fact that the skeleton data is all still little endian would also support the notion of "half-assed optimization for the 360 port". 

kekko: Many 360 games use a gpu-optimized tiling order for their textures. Many people refer to this as "swizzling", which is mostly wrong and confuses terminology with swizzling components around (often used to refer to rgba->abgr or any other combination operations).  I haven't been able to find any public code to untile data though. Which I still find surprising.

But on that note, skeleton data is all figured out. Here's how to get it.

```
{
	char			id[8];
	int				unknownA[8];
	int				unknownB[3];
	int				boneDataSize;
	int				numBonesPlusOne; //i dunno
	BYTE			lks[4]; //"lks\0"
	int				numBones;
	int				unknownE;
	int				boneDataSizeB; //?!
	int				unknownG;
} sedbSklHdr_t;
typedef struct sedbSklBone_s
{
	int				globalIdx;
	int				unknownB;
	int				unknownC;
	int				unknownD;

	float			trans[3];
	float			q[4];
	float			scl[3];

	int				parentIdxA;
	int				boneIdxA;
	int				parentIdxB;
	int				boneIdxB;

	int				stuff[26];
} sedbSklBone_t;

//parse skeleton
static trbBoneInMem_t *Model_TRB_ParseSkeleton(BYTE *fileBuffer, trbResInfo_t *ri, sedbSklHdr_t *sklHdr, int &numBonesOut)
{
	if (sklHdr->lks[0] != 'l' || sklHdr->lks[1] != 'k' || sklHdr->lks[2] != 's')
	{
		numBonesOut = 0;
		printf("Warning: Malformed skeleton header.\n");
		return NULL;
	}

	numBonesOut = sklHdr->numBones;
	trbBoneInMem_t *bonesDst = (trbBoneInMem_t *)rcmalloc(sizeof(trbBoneInMem_t)*sklHdr->numBones, 8381);
	memset(bonesDst, 0, sizeof(trbBoneInMem_t)*sklHdr->numBones);
	for (int i = 0; i < sklHdr->numBones; i++)
	{
		bonesDst[i].mat = g_identityMatrix;
		bonesDst[i].modMat = g_identityMatrix;
		bonesDst[i].parentIdx = -1;
		bonesDst[i].idx = i;
		bonesDst[i].name = NULL;
	}
	int numBoneNames = 0;
	int ofs = sizeof(sedbSklHdr_t) + sklHdr->boneDataSize + 16;
	char **boneNamesAr = (char **)_alloca(sizeof(char **)*sklHdr->numBones);
	while (ofs < ri->size && numBoneNames < sklHdr->numBones)
	{
		char *boneNames = (char *)sklHdr + ofs;
		while (ofs < ri->size && !boneNames[0])
		{
			ofs++;
			boneNames = (char *)sklHdr + ofs;
		}
		if (boneNames[0])
		{
			boneNamesAr[numBoneNames] = boneNames;
			numBoneNames++;
			while (ofs < ri->size && boneNames[0])
			{
				ofs++;
				boneNames = (char *)sklHdr + ofs;
			}
		}
	}

	sedbSklBone_t *bones = (sedbSklBone_t *)(sklHdr+1);
	int numDataBones = sklHdr->boneDataSize / sizeof(sedbSklBone_t);
	for (int i = 0; i < numDataBones; i++)
	{
		sedbSklBone_t *bsrc = bones+i;
		int dstIdx = bsrc->globalIdx;
		trbBoneInMem_t *bdst = bonesDst+dstIdx;

		Math_QuatToMat(bsrc->q, &bdst->mat, false, true);
		Math_VecCopy(bsrc->trans, bdst->mat.o);
		Math_VecScale(bdst->mat.x1, bsrc->scl[0]);
		Math_VecScale(bdst->mat.x2, bsrc->scl[1]);
		Math_VecScale(bdst->mat.x3, bsrc->scl[2]);

		bdst->name = boneNamesAr[i];
		bdst->parentIdx = (bsrc->parentIdxA != -1) ? bones[bsrc->parentIdxA].globalIdx : -1;
		assert(bdst->idx != bdst->parentIdx);
	}

	return bonesDst;
}

```

Only thing is, I haven't found out where the bone range or bone reference map is for each surface. Since surfaces in fact can only reference up to 128 bones per batch (signed byte is also the storage method for models with > 300 bones, like one of the summons). Once I figure that out I'm gonna stick a fork in the format, I need to get back to doing actual work so I'm not planning to tackle the anims any time soon. Although they look pretty straight-forward. 

Edit: Slightly revised bone parse code. This will work for all models, although I initially had the concept of "empty node reference bones" wrong and this code still kind of pointlessly/wrongly adheres to it. Also, ENVD chunks specify each bone reference for a mesh, I had completely missed the bone names in those chunks.  The rest of it is probably what I'd initially written those chunks off as being (morph/cloth deform lists), although who knows, it could be anything. So with that, skeleton/weights can be fully tied together.

Good answer...

If you have the game yourself then just use the tools to rip them, but with only 3 posts on the forum, I doubt anyone will send you models either way.

Generaly most people would use a debug PS3 to get the game data, which most of us dont have, THOUGH some people have copied their own game and can do it that way, though even thats a lengthly process.

Yeah, i pretty much interpreted things in the same manner, just hadn't gotten around to filling in the rest of the data structures.  Given the way everything is laid i would think there are some indices to this information somewhere to avoid having to do the string comparisons.

```
{
	// 0x00
	uint16 unknown0x00;
	uint16 unknown0x02;
	float  unknown0x04;
	uint32 parameterCount;
	uint32 parameterOffsets  <format = hex>; // offset to parameter data offset array
	// 0x10
	uint32 parameterNames    <format = hex>; // offset to parameter names offset array
	uint32 samplerCount      <format = hex>;
	uint32 samplerOffsets    <format = hex>; // offset to sampler data offset array
	uint32 samplerNames      <format = hex>; // offset to sampler names offset array
};

struct SHD_PRAM_DESC
{
	// 0x00
	uint8  dataCount;
	uint8  dataRows;
	uint8  dataColumns;
	uint8  padding0x03;
	uint32 padding0x04[3];
	
	// 0x10
	float4 parameterData; // not sure if this will encompass more for matrix or array types
};

```


i haven't done much when it comes to 360 texture data as of yet, so i have not added anything to handle the swizzling to my code base.

Still verifying some of the data values are what i think they are, but luckily the data block structuring of the file allows for easy piece by piece construction of things as they get validated.

```
{
	// 0x00
	uint32 nameIndex;   // string table index
	uint32 typeIndex;   // string table index
	uint32 unknown0x08;
	uint32 unknown0x0C;
	// 0x10
	float3 translation;
	float4 rotation;
	float3 scale;
	
	uint32 parent;
	uint32 child;
	uint32 sibling;
	uint32 index;
	
	uint32 unknown0x48;
	
	uint32 unknown0x4C[25];
};

struct SEDBSKL_DATA
{
	struct OBJECT_HEADER header;
	
	// 0x30
	uint32 unknown0x30;
	uint32 dataSize       <format = hex>;
	uint32 stringCount;
	uint32 sklTag         <format = hex>;
	// 0x40
	uint32 nameIndex;                     // string table index
	uint32 unknown0x44;
	uint32 jointTableSize <format = hex>;
	uint32 unknown0x4C;
	
	local uint32 jointCount = jointTableSize / 0xB0;
	
	SetBackColor(cLtBlue);
	// 0x50
	struct SKL_JOINT jointTable[jointCount];
};

```


The main thing to note here are the string table indices.  And one of those, either dataSize or jointTableSize, is probably actually considered the string table offset..

Which file has that many bones?  i haven't gone through too many files, but those type of off files would allow me to verify some more things.  Guess i will have a look through the directories a bit more.

Hadn't been back to this data in a while, will check and see i can make any new discoveries.

I've had the same thought with a lot of this format - there's a lot of string-based data that seems like it would just be better off as index data. For the pixel/vertex shaders, though, it's reasonable that the program would be hardcoded to the way memory is laid out for all of the desirable data structures (like samplers and parameters). But the bone names in ENVD is one where it seems like there is really probably an index there. It's just that I tried via the string lookup first, and it worked, so I was too lazy to bother investigating the rest of that data type.  And the one you were probably referring to, parsing out strings to \0 in the skeleton data, that one is really weird too, but I'd say it's safe to say there's not a single literal offset we could be overlooking in that one. SEDBSKL is a relatively tiny data set, and those strings aren't aligned to any kind of consistent boundaries within the string block.

I've also since refined my bone data/header structures to look quite a bit more like yours, and ended up doing away completely with the old flawed idea I had of "identity placeholder bones". I have noticed there the actual number of strings and string offsets for each bone appear to dictate that there is a "string" before the actual string table begins. That also seems to reliably be the case across all models...I just stuck a dummy string at the start of my name array, but I must be missing something there concerning the proper handling.
[Edit: I woke up this morning, and of all the things to be thinking when I woke up, I immediately saw those double zeroes after the first two strings in my head and thought "oh, how'd I miss that".  It's great when your brain seems to solve things for you while you're asleep.]

s401 is a summon with a whole lot of bones, for your reference.

I also came across pc/c595 today. I thought I was hallucinating, and then I completely freaked out, and then I saw some Japanese guy had already found it a couple months ago in the Japanese release. I can't believe they didn't remove it (or censor it) for the US release, though, after that whole "hot coffee" debacle a while back.

I also just jumped into this whole thing 4-5 days ago thinking no one had properly discerned the whole format yet, and here I am 5 days later finding out about 20 people have already and they just didn't put the specs up anywhere. This is why I usually write big formal spec guides whenever I'm seemingly the first to reverse-engineer what is bound to be a popular format.  Or maybe I just missed the info somehow? I'm pretty bad about googling before I leap, I guess.

On a recreational note, I also had a little bit of fun with c595.

Comments at top are wrong/outdated, and lots of dependencies on external data types/functions, so you will not have much luck compiling it as-is. But it is obvious what the external functions do and what the data types are, so, no big deal. Lots of it also still incredibly gross or arbitrary, but again, such is life. 

I don't plan to release any tools, brings too much attention. I think it's enough for the specs to be known. The code above will give you everything you need to view/convert a mesh with full skeleton and pointweighting.

Apologies for there not being any format information publicly available.  i had meant to have some things ready for release for a while now, on this and a number of other formats i have worked on, but i haven't gotten around to finishing the code base i planned on structuring everything around.  i have been wanting to get my skeletal animation, texture management, and format conversion framework going for a while now, but haven't been as productive as i would have liked lately.

Here is information on the ENVD section:

```
{
	SetBackColor(cLtGreen);
	uint16 nameOffset <format = hex>;
	struct
	{
		uint16 vertexCount;
		uint16 indicesOffset <format = hex>;
		uint16 weightsOffset <format = hex>;
	} dataInfo[2]; // not sure why this information repeats
	
	SetBackColor(cLtBlue);
	FSeek(startof(this) + nameOffset);
	string jointName;
	
	SetBackColor(cLtGreen);
	FSeek(startof(this) + dataInfo[0].indicesOffset);
	uint16 vertexIndices[dataInfo[0].vertexCount];
	
	SetBackColor(cLtYellow);
	FSeek(startof(this) + dataInfo[0].weightsOffset);
	uint8  vertexWeights[dataInfo[0].vertexCount];
};

struct MESH_ENVD
{
	// 0x00
	struct CHILD_HEADER header;
	
	// 0x10
	struct ENVD_INFO envdInfo;
};

```


Currently a lot of the things i have worked on are still in binary template format for 010 Editor, with a few things hacked together for obj conversion to test in some cases.  i plan on creating a more general model viewing application with animation support and a few other things soon hopefully.  Need to build up a good library of code for handling some of the texture and conversion related tasks, as i haven't written anything up yet for handling a decent interchange format like collada for instance..

Ah, you posted while i was typing, heh.

Oh, does ENVD repeat all the vertex weights with absolute-indexing? That sure seems arbitrary, although there are a lot of questionable storage types and decisions made in this format. 

Edit: Oh, I looked at the actual block, I guess you meant the bone references the verts which are weighted to it, so...I guess there's nothing that would make it unnecessary to look the bone up by string, still. I'm also not sure what that data would be used for at runtime. I can't think of any per-vert-that-references-bone calculations that wouldn't be better off either precalculated or done in a fundamentally different way (like transforming base pose bounds by bonemat*invBaseMat).

Being able to skin things on the cpu is helpful in a lot of case where you need the actual mesh to reflect the skinned position, as it cannot be read back from the gpu with normal hardware skinning (exact ray-mesh intersection/collisions for instance).  Also as has been noted, this may also be left over from ps3(or other) data where the skinning could be done on the spus instead of the gpu.  Not sure if this is how they intended it though.

Sure, but you don't need to know which bones reference which verts to do that.  Pre-multiplying bone matrices should give roughly equivalent performance to skinning verts with bone reference indices, after all, and it doesn't need all that extra data. But I suppose that is likely what they had in mind.

True.  Don't know why they store it again in this case, though i have seen other formats store them with the bones in addition to or instead of the vertex data. i guess if anything it saves having to parse the data back out of the vertex information, heh.  More than likely a data separation decision as normally outside of rendering purpose data would not be packed as it is with the vertex declaration data, each component being stored separately, thus skinning information would not be directly related to the data for rendering without the necessary skeleton information.

hi im new in this forum. i was woundering if you can upload a obj file of lighting or at least some wire renders of the face. It will be very helpful since i was modeling in 3d's max a hi res version of lighting but i haven't found any good references yet.

Highly doubtful that you'll get a model... you might get some renders if someone is nice enough...

BTW, Hey, MrAdults, long time no see... not that you'd remember me. Satoh/X-dina from Qhimm...

Nice work on the format so far, you're doing hella better than my investigation into CCS format... 

As soon as I get my hands on the debugeries of the PS3 systematron I'm gonna be looking into this myself probably. Though I need a PS3 in the first place I suppose (I have the game already... sucks I can't play it)



Getting back to the 3DS Max stuff, you'd be better off in your modeling practices if you used still frames to work from, that way you learn more than you would if you were looking at a wireframe or just stealing the actual face...

Anyway, good luck with the format.

Oh, X-Dina, I remember you!  Nice to see you around.

I've actually been doing all my work on the 360 assets - you can do your own rip pretty trivially on a 360 image, and from there you can get all the data out of x360.bin files with...probably either a direct or slightly-modified version of aluigi's FF13 ps3.bin BMS script (on his site). I don't think the x360.bin's even had any big-endian structures in them, although I can't remember too well anymore. I've already moved onto my next reverse-engineering project which tends to flush all the details of the last one right out. 

I suspect my code will work perfectly with the PS3 version assets if you just take out the endian swaps, but I haven't tested it out. Let me know if you get around to it some day.

well, you should redirect output to a file:

```
programname.exe filename.trb > mesh.obj
```

the program does not consider imgb files, thus no textures sorry. I made a separate tool for the textures, starting from the code MrAdults kindly shared some post ago.

You again? We always seem to be on the sam forums 

Anyway, i just tried it on my 64bit computer, i got an error about sxtrace. I'll just try compiling it myself. I've got Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 if thats any good for compiling this?

It should be just fine so long as there's no proprietary files that the original coder used... and even then, it's as simple as getting them and adding them to the project...

Visual studio is nothing more than a pen with which to write... it may be a different color than some other pen like bloodshed dev, or what have you, but the words you write with it are the same words...

IE: all it needs to do is compile the program. effectively most compilers compile the same way... at least as far as I've ever heard.

EDIT: and you're all saying that I need the 360 version of the game to get the models et al?

If that's the case I'm a bit disappointed now... (Has just bought a PS3 for my home theatre...)((Loathes xbox with a passion as well))

Hello everyone~ i would like to ask a question~ 

ok ok ok i managed to get the source codes working <with sweat and blood attatched T.T> i had an unusual amount of trouble... but i got it to export as obj with working textures from the sample file that was posted a few pages back~ Ahem -.- ......... My big problem now is actually extracting the rest of the darn files from the x360.bins >.< am using the code from Luigi's site but am only turning up with about 5-6 mbs of clb files O.o what em i doing wrong? >.<;;; 


thanks for any info in advance~

try to build it with [Dev-CPP](http://sourceforge.net/projects/dev-cpp/files/Binaries/Dev-C%2B%2B%204.9.9.2/devcpp-4.9.9.2_setup.exe/download). its a simple IDE for mingw compiler.

no, there is no public tool at this moment for that.

Does this version do textures as well, or is there a separate program for it?
no, there is no public tool at this moment for that.

Ok then, cheers, i'll give this one a try.

EDIT: Yeah, this one compiled. Where do i add this line:

```
programname.exe filename.trb > mesh.obj
```


Thanks.

i believe you can just make a batch file with that command line

programname.exe c201.x360.trb > mesh.obj

in note pad and save it as insertname.bat and change the file format from txt to all and then click the batch file and it should convert it to .OBJ~


on a side note, am still struggling to get the bms script to extract the data from the filelist_ and the white_ T.T still getting 6 mbs of clb files :/ if anyone can shed some light on this. just like... point me in the right direction to start my search lol

I guess that the script only works with the 1.7gb file, the one with the characters in it.

You expected otherwise? As far as I'm aware, the game hasn't been out long enough to have special edition rereleases... that and why the hell would square ever name something a stupid name like allstars... much less a Final Fantasy...?

Erm...its not a VERSION... FFXIII Allstars is a rip version, by a ripping group called "ALLSTARS" lol.

But yeah...FFXIII ALLSTARS does sound horrible...

Ooooo i see i see, so that 24 gigs is for the 3 dvds of the allstar rip of ffx13 O.o. .... well i suppose you COULD use that ... but you shouldnt need all 3 dvds, only need disk 1 for the rip to work @.@ should only be about 6-7 gigs i suppose

Wanna Thank Kekko, thanks for sharing the converter.
the FF13 models are quite nice and its also very interesting how they utilized their texture space. truely something to learn from, and I'll certainly share any fan renders I may make in the future. 

lastly, I thought I would share this list for easy reference;
n901	Serah Farron
n903	Nora Estheim
n906	Jihl Nabaat
n910	Lebreau
c001	Lightning
c005	Vanille
c595	Vanille, Nude
c006	Fang
s201	Shiva
s203	Shiva(2)

Ack!!! does your texture rip tool get alphas? O.o mine only get just the color lol i had to make my own alphas >.< 



yes i suck at paint lol

On a side note~~~~~

Is there any way to rip zones?   like battle maps and such... i think the zone files that are like 200mbs+ have trb and img files in it... so only prob is ripping them effectively @.@

Why didnt i think of that....that worked  Thanks 

EDIT: Actually, the obj file is 0 bytes...

EDIT 2: Ignore that, i had done something wrong, it works now

Hey, I've been attempting to extract the files from the white_imgu.x360.bin.

So far I am able to get trb files out, but when I use "ff13.exe c001.x360.trb > c001.x360.obj" tool, I get a .obj file with 0 filesize.

I noticed you had the same problem once. How did you fix it?

Are the offsets correct in the file list?

Or may I use your bms script that you used to fix this?


I also wrote a program in c# that finds all zlib headers in the white_imgu.x360.bin, and attempts to extract from the offset the zlib header was located at.

My C# Tool doesn't name the files too pretty yet, but it does extract about 10000 files from the white_imgu.x360.bin
It names them based on their numeric offset
so if a zlib header was found, and the data was actually a valid zlib compressed stream, the file gets named white_imgu.x360.bin_347273823.bin
the number in the name, being the numeric offset where the zlib stream was found.

Still doesn't name the files nicely though, and I don't know what ones are the trb files cause the offsets don't seem to match any in the file list.

Anyway, can you help? 




EDIT:


Nm.   My brute force zlib method did just that, and extracted all the possible zlib data from the file.  I was able to convert the trb once I figured out how to convert the offsets properly.

The 360 file is named differently than the ps3 files, as such does not match with the way the original script file is attempting to match the filelist with the data bin files.  rename them to work with the script as is, or modify the script to look for the names correctly.

ie.  rename filelistu.x360.bin to filelist_imgu.x360.bin

Hope that helps.

I feel dumb XD it worked now, thanks for the advice revelation. I guess getting the textures converted would require another tool.

if that fails, then you need to download the windows compiler, and compile a new EXE for your system.

mine was built under windowsXP SP3 32bit

edit
by the way, just a tip; but what I did to surf through the content was:
1. created a batch script to convert EVERYTHING
2. Installed a basic OBJ viewer

then I could just double click on whatever OBJ and instantly find out where everything was... instead of importing one by one into blender or max. that seems to take way more time O_o

I'm not sure how people are getting textures from the game actually. and it may be hush hush if its using an 360 sdk tool. but otherwise the last person I asked, pointed in the way of a PSP tool.. which don't make sense.

personally I just used a hex editor, and my original unswizzle scripts I designed for PaintshopPro.

I didnt care to figure out how the texture dump file was indexed, so i just jumped to each fresh area of bytes after the padding bytes used.. c0 or c1 or cc something they used for padding

it was no picnic, so you might want to beg borrow and steal a tool off someone

Once you have all the textures and models extracted how do you get the textures to display on the model in 3ds max? I keep just getting gray, green, and pink metallic colors only. I'm sure I must be missing something really obvious.   

I've got a .dae file and a bunch of .dds and pngs.

First find a tool called mesh2rdm. You can just google it, it's pretty easy to find.

Then put the mesh2rdm.exe in the same folder with the trb and imgb file. Create a bat file with something like this in it: 
"mesh2rdm input-file-name.trb output-file-name.dae -daeout" After you run that you will get a .dae file and a bunch of .dds and .png files.

All thanks goes to nathen41.

I do it a quicker way than that:

I open the green texture in photoshop, lets use Hope for this example. That texture is trbtex0015.

Once its open, use the eyedropper tool and select the purple background.

Then, right click on the eraser and select background eraser.

Make sure that the colour you just picked at the back of the colour box, and white at the front.

Then just erase, and watch as the purple is erased leaving the rest of the image.

Do this for all the shades of purple, and you'll get good looking alpha channels.

Yeah, the green maps are masking textures. What I did was to open that texture in photoshop, look in the RGB channels and looked for a blackn' white texture, then copy it and paste it in a new channel called alpha in the hair texture.

The knowledge goes thanks to Mario Kart and google xD.

Theres that, and what some people will do if they get hold of them *CoughqhimmCough*

I'll do my best to keep these out of their sight.

Anyway, how do you add the little detail maps in 3dsmax? Looking at Hope, in the game has has little lines on the orange part of his jacket. Its a separate texture, but how do i apply that to the model?

Here is some tip to make an alpha map.

1.Step
Open image with photoshop. and turn it Grayscale.




2.Step
Use Brigtness/contrast on adjustments tap





3.Step
Apply Filter - Blur - Gaussian Blur (It seems like fake Anti-Aliasing)





4.Step
Use in 3ds Max - Material - Opercity

Ok guys, NEVER give out any models, ever. If a few people come here, and start asking for them, do not give them out at all. I'm actually afraid of what some people will do with them, so i think its best to keep them out of sight.

Can someone tell me if I need the contents of all 3 discs or is it like FFVII where I only needed one, because my DVD Drive isn't working so I gotta use a friend's PC and I don't have much memory in my flashdrive to carry the files, also are the movies extractable.

Thanks, though I was actually asking is if the first disc has ALL the models for example does the first disc have the model for the final boss?
And about the movies I was asking if they are extractable, I figured they'll be across different discs.
Thanks in advance.

Thanks in advance.

Considering the game is split across 3 discs, and the final boss wont appear until the final disc (3) then im to assume that the 1st disc only contains things you should/can MEET/VIEW within the gameplay of disc one.

Thus no, the final boss is unlikely to be on disc one.

Saying that though, some games do put everything on each disc within an encrypted folder/file, and then ONLY call on what they need.

Hi, Can somebody summarize everything and tell me how I can convert 3D models and textures from. imgb and. trb files. I have a version of ff13 for xbox306?
I read the whole topic, but none of the tools did not help me  

ps: is there a possibility at the moment to convert 3D models with bones/skin?

I found the latest version of the program mesh2rdm.exe, but it does not work:

```
The model could not be converted.
Cleaned 4.00MB (in 1 pools).
Push any key to continue.
```

Why?

Hi everyone,

New to the forum and would like to give extracting the FF models a go. So far I'm just using the sample file from orbbu and the compile from epopoe, could do with some help. The program runs but just creates a 0b obj? I'm using win7 64bit and dont have access to kekko's code due to the link being down.

I was able to get it extracted with mesh2rdm but I noticed some parts of the boots on Lightning were missing compared to some of the images posted here? - I was thinking its either due to not using kekko's code or the sample file is a lower LOD compared to the model extracted on some of the images posted here.

Thx

Hi all. I have a problem with the materials /textrues. After assinging them to the model i have black areas which have no texture. I first thought i did something wrong when i assinged it but in GoogleSketchup i realized what is wrong. Some parts of the texture were assigned at the backside of the faces. 

Can somebody tell me how i  can fix my problem ?

Tell me how you can import models from .trb and .imgb to 3d max  

Your problem: none textured polygons in sketch up actually normal-flipping!

Still having problems with 0 kb .obj, noticed afew people had the same problem- could really do with some help? does anyone have kekko's code so I can try recompile on my system and see if that helps?

Tosyk: Max supports obj aswell as dae(meshtordm) which the exporters create. You will probably have to re-assign the textures etc... I'm new to this so I'm not sure how much work is needed to put it all together.

Why do you need to mess around with Kekko's code if mesh2rdm does the job?

For those who still don't get it: google mesh2rdm and download it. It converts FFXXIII models perfectly along with skinning data and textures.

edit:
And now Noesis [http://oasis.xentax.com/](http://oasis.xentax.com/) does the job.

For those who still don't get it: google mesh2rdm and download it. It converts FFXXI models perfectly along with skinning data and textures.

For now I'm just using the sample file supplied here, I wanted to make sure I understand how to extract that before I bothered ripping my game disc. And I have noticed that the model in the sample when extracted using mesh2rdm is missing poly on her boots- Comparing it to the screen shots in this thread.

If somebody can confirm that this is the norm and when I use the actual .trb from the game disc the boot detail is there...then I'll begin the disc rip 

Edit: also missing other details like her arm bracelet thing.

There are two versions of the main characters. The cinematic model (high poly) and the gameplay model (low poly).
It's missing the "details" because you are using the low poly version.

So it is just a different LOD. I'll get onto ripping the game disc and go from there.

Than ks to all who shared in this thread, they look like really nice models to study..

Hey guys, can anyone confirm that mesh2rdm fully converts the models?  I managed to get it to export the mesh in .dae format, which includes animation bones, and the textures in .dds format.  The problem is the .dae didn't preserve any UV coordinates or skinning data for the animation bones.  The bone structure is there, but it's completely independent of the model.  Some people here are reporting a 100% successful conversion.  Can anyone help with this?

I also had trouble getting mesh2rdm to work on my Windows XP machine.  It would just hang the second I tried to convert a model with it.  It worked fine on a laptop that I have running Windows 7, though.

With open collada the skinning data works ok but the uv's are messed, needs to be fixed manually.

I had similar trouble with mesh2rdm and COLLADA files...

Are you by chance using Maya to open the DAE's?

I think you should ask MrAdults because he is the creator of mesh2rdm

1) Use this plugin, not the Autodesk's piece of rotten shit: [http://opencollada.org/download.html](http://opencollada.org/download.html)
2) After importing the model into Max, apply the UVW Xform under the skin modifier, flip the V Tile and collapse to the UVW Xform. This will fix the texture coordinates.

@ Darko and firsak: Thanks guys, it turns out the problem was more with the importer, and not mesh2rdm itself.  I downloaded Open Collada, and that did the trick.  The UVs are a bit messed up but that should be easily fixed by following firsak's instructions.  Thanks!

Are you by chance using Maya to open the DAE's?I'm using 3ds Max.  Check firsak's post, there's a version of Open Collada for Maya as well, and that might solve the problem for you.  Just remember you'll most likely have to fix the UVs.

Awesome to see the models finally being able to be ripped from the game ^^ Been waiting forever for this! 

I do not quite get HOW people here rip the models from the game though. I understand how mesh2rdm works and how things go from there on, but I just can't get the models off of the game. I got both versions to my disposal, so which version is easiest to rip and how to do it?

The xbox360 version is the easiest to extract files from. You need to look for a program called "Schtrom360Xtract." I think version 4.1 is the newest. Then use that program to extract the files.

Okay, so I did use the tool, got several .bin files from the first disc (only first disc is needed isn't it?)  But after that I am lost, tried what I know to unpack the bin files, but nothing seems to work? Any help on this too perhaps?

> The 360 file is named differently than the ps3 files, as such does not match with the way the original script file is attempting to match the filelist with the data bin files.  rename them to work with the script as is, or modify the script to look for the names correctly.

ie.  rename filelistu.x360.bin to filelist_imgu.x360.bin

Hope that helps.

Use quickbms and the ff13.bms script and follow the above tips.

Thanks a lot guys... i'm a noob in this i don't know if i have the basic idea

1) Use the "Schtrom360Xtract." to unpack the files of your xbox360 FF13 dvd01 in you pc
2) Now you got several .bin files...

And the next step is...... i'm not sure....

a)Use "Noesis v1.31" to open the bin files 
b) If the noesis don't work use "quickbms" and the script "here" to unpack the bin files, again use the Noesis to open and export the models

the only file i have is the c201.x360.trb (lighting file) and the fang file, i want the others characters, please help this noobs

Upon using the quickbms along with the ff13.bms found on this forum, I managed to extract all the possible files. Just remember to rename the file if you use the 360 version ^^ No clue about that Noesis program you plan on using though, haven't read anything mentioned about that in this thread. And to open and export the models, I used mesh2rdm and exported as .obj with flipped uv's

Thank you so much Lizz, rename the files???

"ie. rename filelistu.x360.bin to filelist_imgu.x360.bin" like this i think

well i will test it tomorrow, i hope it's work   , what ever with my noobs skills i don't know...

For now my "wet dream" lol is somebody uploading the bin files of the characters, but maybe it's just a dream

Indeed, that is the part I mean with renaming. Also, I doubt anyone would actually upload a character file, since I read something in this thread a while back that that isn't quite allowed here or so? ^^;

Sorry for dragging this up again, but I'm still stuck at a stage before all the exciting stuff happens...    kinda hoping someone can point me in the right direction..

I have an iso file of the 1st disc on a virtual drive, and I have Schtrom360Xtract v4.1.

When I run Schtrom360Xtract, i set the DVD-ROM type to MagicISOVirtual DVD-ROM 1.0A, I select *.bin for Extraction file and the Task as "whole disc stealth xtreme 3.0 splitVid"...

However, I only get a single IMAGE.bin file along with a IMAGE.dvd file...

This definitely isn't the result everyone else seems to be getting, which is a White_imgu.360.bin file as well as an index file.

Could someone tell me what I'm doing wrong please? Really appreciate it.

In 360Xtract you are choosing the wrong extract option. You need to go to tools and click "XDVDFS XTR."

thanks Rikto, that did the trick! Managed to get white_imgu.x360.bin file as well as the filelistu.x360.bin   

thanks for the tips too, babo3615, sadly I got stuck again. So close, yet so far. 

I have quickbms now, and I got the bms script from [http://aluigi.altervista.org/papers/bms/ff13.bms](http://aluigi.altervista.org/papers/bms/ff13.bms)

I also changed the file name of filelistu.x360.bin to filelist_imgu.x360.bin

had all the files in the same folder, created an extra folder called extracted

In command prompt, I typed " quickbms.exe ff13.bms filelist_imgu.x360.bin extracted "

however, I get a "error in src\quickbms.c line 2960: CMD_Open_func() "

Am I still doing something wrong?

You need:

filelist_imgu.x360.bin
filelist_scru.x360.bin
white_imgu.x360.bin
white_scru.x360.bin

then

Run QuickBMS.exe > use FF13.bms

That will extract them, but you cant view them.

Proves what I said long before FF13 was released, that they recycled AC Cloud's head mesh.

How to get the models properly ? Extracting them with Noesis v1.5 on COLLADA format ( .dae ) importing them into Maya but the whole model is just a white pile of vertex, tried in some other way, exporting in .smd then converting to .fbx, works fine but still errors and I can't pose it or smt else, just 4-5 bones works ( I get a error msj tho about the bones/bind pose ) 

Same problem with Ninja Gaiden 2 ... and maybe others ... 

Also extracted the /chr/ folder from the whole DVD's, there's any diff between them ? Checked few files randomly but they are the same ... Will any problems occur if I just put all of them in one folder ? ( Currently I have the whole 3 /chr/ folders )

Double this. I understand the need for fappin material, but at the very least be somewhat subtle about it. Yes, there's a nudie Vanille model. I don't understand why it exists, as it really doesn't make sense within the context of the game's (paper-thin and poorly-organized) story, but there it is. If you want it that badly, nab it yourself. And when you do, keep your sex poses off the forum!

Or don't. But let's just be a little more civil about it, kay?

Oh my god, A MILLION TIMES THIS. Hate to sound pesky, but is any work being done on extracting the game's environments (or sounds)? They're absolutely gorgeous and I'd love to use some of them in my scenes (already have one planned that pretty much requires Pulse).

Speaking of which, Nathen41, where did you get the environment in [this post](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?p=38224#p38224) from? I'd love to know where you can get some nice-looking environments like that. Rendering scenes using a plain-white background gets old after a while   

Oh, and I made this. Click for larger size.

So anyone please ? What's the correct way to get the models through Noesis ? I can't pose any character, I always get a error on importing .dae or some else format, about the bones esp, they aren't binded to skin.

Did you enable the plugin in Window -> Setting/Preferences -> Plugin manager?
In case the imported result looks too messy, did you scale the model up when you were exporting it (I recommend scaling up by 250)? The models are very small by default and helpers occupy the whole screen when imported into Maya.

@Aurangzeb56
the problem is, the vertices in your imported model are not welded together, and thats what makes the diffuse to display randomly sometimes(it makes the normals orientation reverse, vice versa). google = how to weld vertex and reversing normals on 3dsmax. that should fix your problem.

-i agree with ultimaespio, it's rather sad. 

i hate to be a prick but almost all import/export are solved except for the enviros, I hope that this thread doesn't go any further with regards to the topics that are already discussed, because SE(squeenIx) might notice their ffxiii files have been meddled. I've read some news about them shutting down some sites that do so, SE might make unnecessary actions about our forums, if you know what i mean. so please, read the whole thread first then, if you have any questions regarding this thread, backread it. otherwise google is your friend

If the zone models are themed, like there are several that are from an airship or from town but lack textures, try look a folder before or after a themed group, ussually they there is just an Imgb <or whater texture file> that will have all textures, thats what i found out with SOME Character models (*< __ >);;;  

BY the way @__@ Which files did you rename to extract the zone data lol i tried that a long time ago but i just couldnt figure out which file did what when it came to renaming the right ones for extractions T.T

EDIT!

I think i got it lol Thanks anyways!!! if it wasnt for you post, i wouldnt have looked into it more!!! /hats off to you~

Edit 2

As i thought, the Textures are located in only one of the zone files for each "Group" from what it looks like, its in the last folder per "Group"

Edit 3

I correct myself, it seems that some models within a group also contain textures O.o.... this is confusing ><;

Thx,,i think textures are there as you said.
You must extract the character container first.
The keys(a lots of filstxxx.dat ) is hidden in the  \white_data\sys\outport\zone\folder 
put them in the zone folder with those white_xxx.dat  ,rename filelist_xxx.dat to fit them.that's it:)

hi
i dont know you guys have this problem too,but for me i have wrong bone place for model
i used openCOLLADA to import model

and also i think you guys had something wrong about the texture
for alpha hair you just should open that blue and green texture in photoshop

there are three channels in the texture,green one is the alpha we need so you should copy that channel to RGP channel

then you are done

i just hope you understand my bad English
this problem is for normal maps too and you just need to play with channels   
this is the deal so tell me how can i fix my problem?

I've told you, your textures are upside down. I've just tested it with my model, and it came out just like yours. Export it again with Noesis, but make sure that you select "Flip UV".

I have 3-2 questions,
1: Does anyone still have the source code of ff13.exe, its not working on my side.
2: How do i export bones?
3: Any status on animations?

Noesis is giving me a hard time exporting bones, Collada isn't doing UV Mapping at all, OBJ does not support bones and the rest screw up the mesh!
Please help me out here.

Only thing is, I haven...

How about this? He done it.

Also, for some reason if i insert the code he added, and editit by some, i get a massive amount of errors.
More coding, bah.

EDIT:
I have found a easier way for an alpha mask for the hair

Step one, open the weirdly colored texture


Step two, look at the layers, channels dialog.


Step three, go to the channels tab


Step four, make all channels except green invisible


Select All (Ctrl+A on windows, Apple Key + A on mac)
and paste it to all two channels (not including alpha)

Step five, save as an copy

That's because MrAdults is awesome and is the author of mesh2rdm and Noesis, so he obviously knows what he is doing.

ff13.exe is named FF13 2 OBJ or something similar, and as you already know .obj does not support bones.

Download a copy of Mesh2rdm

Then make a .bat file with this code "mesh2rdm ????.x360.trb ????.dae -daeout"

Rename the ???? to the file name of which trb file you want to convert and also name it what you want~

Put all three Mesh2rdm, the bat file, and the trb file in one folder and then double click the bat file

Let it convert and then enjoy~

it will make the model a dae format AND it will have bones~ <weighed> 


Good Luck

With the newer version you don't need to put -daeout, you just need to make sure you write [filename].dae

i did what you said,but i got this error :

Weird. It States "Unkown option -daeout"
Get this one [http://www.richwhitehouse.com/index.php ... rdmv45.zip](http://www.richwhitehouse.com/index.php?content=inc_projects.php&filemirror=mesh2rdmv45.zip)
ALSO, I had some problems with the dae regarding textures, so i just got the obj mesh and thrown the dae mesh out.
Bones are irritating to make.
Anyway, now that we can know how the mesh structure is, someone could make a start on animations, but oh well. this is good enough!

Take a look at `s1.white.x360.bin`  which is in mot -> pc -> sk_c001_lt
Starting at 0x280 to 0x2AA it states `MotionCommand

OKAY, so this is what i noticed.
-daeout is deprecated (apparently).
use -flipuv instead to save time.
try pressing any key when its stuck.

well the file size is kinda big in size so sorry but i'll have to say no

EDIT: Seems like the first disc has ALL teh characters models,since i ripped the second disc too and it contained the same characters names as in the first disc and the models were same too,So that means square just put the whole thing in all three of the discs BUT used something to activate the models that are supposed to appear in the right time and compressed the others XD

<EDIT> Nevermind, finally found the right thread. Not supposed to use MultiEx Com, supposed to use QuickBMS... P_P </EDIT>

I realize this may not be exactly where this should go, but it's heavily related. 
I have Dirge of Cerberus, but Aluigi's BMS keeps throwing "Multiex 3 could not process" or "error 7, Out of memory" depending on whether I use the .txt or BMS respectively. I've renamed the original FILELIST.BIN and KEL.DAT to everything I can think of, with no effect. Do I need to copy the entire disk to my hdd to get it to work (I'm not too familiar with MexScript, but I don't think it looks at anything except "filelist_" and "white_" ...)
Any ideas?

Hmmm
This is how mine looks like

```
mesh2rdm ..\out\chr\pc\c001\bin\c001.x360.trb c001\c001.x360.dae -daeout -flipuv

```

Mesh2rdm is in a directory called Convert, that folder is in the same directory to where i have extracted all the files ("out")
In the Convert folder i created more folders corresponding to the names (c001, c002) 
That's how i do it anyway.

If it doesn't work, try updating your mesh2rdm or update your windows

EDIT: You still have "input-file-" and "output-file" in your names, you can remove that

Uhuh, I have always had problems with DAE and UV, try exporting it both to OBJ and DAE, import the OBJ for the mesh, and the DAE for the skeleton, and find a way to apply them both, as far as i know, i don't know anything (AT ALL) about Maya or 3ds; you might need to look that up.

i just want you to show these two screens of my vanille model. i decided to create the bone structure myself because as you all should know its hard to extract the original bone files. it was kinda easy (youtube tutorials ftw) and the outcome is not perfect but acceptable.


I also have a request. does anyone have a model file of one of vanilles weapons? Please help me

I did not know much about extracting model files when i started the project, and there was no post (anyway i didn't find it here) which explains how to use collada or smd to extract the bone files too.

But thanks, i will maybe need that info for future projects!

Uhm, okay, I've done everything pointed out in this thread, yet I fail at the mesh2rdm-part. Whenever I (try to...) extract the textures out of c001.x360.trb, I only get 29 files (5 PNG files, 24 DDS files), of which every single one seems to be corrupted. And by corrupted I mean: the files are "full of artifacts". I would provide a sample but I'm afraid of it, since it could (at least) include code of S/E   


I apologize if the question has been asked before and was properly answered, but I haven't found anything...

Oh man, don't use mesh2rdm, use Noesis instead:

[http://oasis.xentax.com/index.php?content=downloads](http://oasis.xentax.com/index.php?content=downloads)

It's the upgraded version of mesh2rdm and it has a gui. Just export mesh to .dae or smd, textures to tga and -scale 100 and that's all.

Thanks, but noesis doesn't work either. I mean, now the textures are all .tga's, yet every single one seems to be broken, just like you can see on the attachment. (Not a "real" file, just a recreation in GMASK)

Not that I know of. I've gotten the character files from a colleague...
So, theoretically, it could be possible, but I don't think so.

Remove the imgb from the PS3 file and mesh2rdm/Noesis will open it. The models share the same amount of polys, and the textures are probably the same.

> Here is some tip to make an alpha map.

1.Step
Open image with photoshop. and turn it Grayscale.




2.Step
Use Brigtness/contrast on adjustments tap





3.Step
Apply Filter - Blur - Gaussian Blur (It seems like fake Anti-Aliasing)





4.Step
Use in 3ds Max - Material - Opercity

I tried to follow epopoe's post to get the alphamap to work, but I am having some trouble. I used the original alphamap which is the greenish-purple color, and converted in photoshop as he instructed. However, when I apply the map as opacity in 3dmax my fang has completely transparent hair. Is there some settings I'm overlooking? Can someone steer me in the right direction? Thanks.

Don't follow that lame tutorial, just take that mask texture, open it in photoshop ang go to rgb channels. Then, just see which one is the black'n white texture you need and paste it in the hair map as an alpha channel and save it as a tga and that's all.

No need to edit anything, no need to aply a filters.

Well, I spent the last day or so attempting to use most of your methods of bin extraction and... none work (devil possessed computer maybe)! I've used the filelist_imgu.x360.bin rename trick to try get it to open the white_imgu.x360.bin for Noesis (latest one) and on QuickBSM with the ff13.bms script and all of the time I get nothing but 18 folders and files containing 18 models (12 are texture only) each extraction ends with this error (QuickBMS) as well I'm sure one of you may understand how to cure it.

```
Error: No such file or directory
```

Noesis just says it can export it (.bin), but chooses to extract nothing (says it cannot find a folder inside of the .bin).
I can extract maps as well (filelist_scru.x360.bin), but they may not be all files because I get the same above error.

Have any of you actually extracted the enemies? I just want one of those Sanctum Guard models (If you would be so kind).[/size]

EDIT: Turns out, there is an error in Noesis that leaves out the / in the source directory so it always would attempt to extract a nonexistent file. To fix this you must change the name of your archive file (not the index) to have the name of the folder in which the index file is located with no spaces between the two names. The BMS script is useless so don't bother with that. It'll always extract a few files and break the process.

[](http://funkyimg.com/viewer.php?img=/2/646/929/dg.jpg)

maybe it's because i have undub ps3 asia version of the game?

edit: i solve problem, but now a can't extract textures, all trb is only 3d object, if open with imgb noesis will close with error, mesh2rdm.exe the same thing but in console before error it say what texture is loading. 

[](http://funkyimg.com/viewer.php?img=/2/244/368/egw.jpg)

how extract textures?

edit2
chrrox,MrAdults  can you fix tools that it was possible to extract textures from ps3, because it not work, please?

I tried to make it kinda borderline SFW.   

Maybe someone can confirm this for me.
I'm using Noesis 2.982 and when I export to Collada, it only exports a single texture.
I verified this by opening the dae file in Notepad++ and sure enough, only 1 texture.
Luckily the mapping is exported properly and it's just a matter of re-applying the textures.
After fixing the textures I re-exported from Blender and looked at that Collada file and it was perfectly fine.
Went on to import that into Softimage and Max just to make sure.
Also the Wavefront exporter doesn't export any textures (no mtl file).
Re-downloaded Noesis just to make sure the first download wasn't corrupt or something and same issues.
I'm using Windows 7 Ultimate x64. Tried it on Windows XP x32 also and nothing changed.

Like I said, not a big deal. Just have to re-apply the textures.

That's my bad. I broke COLLADA export for games that use the same name for every material (e.g. FF13) at some point. It will be unbroken next release. In the mean time, I guess you can just go bowling.

They're located in bin files under the "mot" subdirectory.
Hopefully someone who knows what they're doing is looking at this.....

For the Windows users out there that have ripped the models and hate having all of those "bin" subdirectories:
for /r %x in (*.*) do move "%x" "%x"\..\..      -move all the files up 1 directory
for /d /r %x in (bin) do rd "%x"                      -get rid of all the now empty "bin" subdirectories

I managed to get files out of the 360 version by changing filelistu to filelist as mentioned on page #14, but it would only extract the big white file, the zone files still don't want to play.
I've read through the thread 2 - 3 times and can't see what people did to get it to work. I've tried experimenting but to no avail.

QuickBMS don't like the zone files, Noesisv don't like the zone files.
I'm only interested in the textures for environment and doodads, not models.

Ps: Had an epiphany of understanding and renamed filelist_imgu to filelist_* where *is the name of the file I'm trying to unpack minus white_. It stopped giving me the error that the file didn't exist, but instead it complains that the zlib/deflate input is wrong or incomplete and that there was an error with decompression.

I've read through the thread 2 - 3 times and can't see what people did to get it to work. I've tried experimenting but to no avail.

QuickBMS don't like the zone files, Noesisv don't like the zone files.

In the data you extracted with the characters,weapons,etc., there's a "Zone" folder.
You'll see a bunch more folders in there (z000 - z255) and then there's a bunch of bin/bin2 files.
Now in the first data extracted from the disc there's also a "Zone" folder and you'll notice from the file sizes that's where the real zone data is.
Find the large zone file in the original extracted data (like white_z004u_img.x360.bin - for instance - 240.5MB), take  a corresponding bin file from the zone folder in the  data set you extracted for the characters (filelist_z004u.x360.bin2) copy it over to "white_data\zone" where the large file is and rename it to "filelist_imgu.x360.bin".
Take "white_z004u_img.x360.bin" and rename it to "white_imgu.x360.bin"
Then you should be able to extract everything.
Here's a zone I ripped as proof:

Quite amazing seeing PS3 models ripped and in 3DS Max. I don't suppose similar methods could be applied to other PS3 games such as say, Dragon Ball Z: Burst Limit?

Most of the content is from Xbox 360, not 360 and also the poly count in both versions is the same, so do the textures.

Hm, so it might be possible with the Xbox360 version of Burst Limit?

And as not to be too off-topic are there a few textures not loaded on that bottom image, TheDude?

Yeah, for the life of me I couldn't find all of the textures for that one. I just put it in there to show off the nice environment maps it has.
(1 - 4x2k, 1 - 2x2k image)
The first 2 images are of the house in Oerba where you find Bhakti.
Also I didn't realize when playing the game that one of Vanille's skirts is draped over the back of a chair.

I'd just like to thank everybody here at Xentax and the devs of Noesis for the research done and the programs developed. I find it very interesting to poke around the internals of games even though I don't know much about the technical aspects game development and 3D modeling myself.

That being said, I took it up to myself to learn to tinker with my free student copy of Max and create images for the [Final Fantasy Wiki](http://finalfantasy.wikia.com), which made for interesting reading while playing XIII (my first FF game; I actually enjoyed it despite its flaws). To contribute back, I created some images like these of [Orphan](http://images4.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20110408154133/finalfantasy/images/d/d0/Orphan2ndBattle.png), [Barthandelus's 3rd Form](http://images2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20110405154919/finalfantasy/images/a/ad/Barthandelus3rdBattle.png), and [a statue of Lindzei from the Narthex](http://images3.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20110415171939/finalfantasy/images/c/c3/LindzeiStatue.png) among others. They may not look that great with the lighting but its a start for some who is just learning modeling and good enough for the wiki.

Again, kudos to everybody here.

That's some good work. Doing fan related projects is a fun way to learn. Maybe the best way for that matter.

1. Make a legal copy of your XBOX 360 disc

2. Get XBOX 360 ISO Extract by somski:
[http://wooot.de/isoextract.zip](http://wooot.de/isoextract.zip)

3. Extract the data

4. Rename filelistu.x360.bin to filelist_imgu.x360.bin

5. Get QuickBMS:
[http://aluigi.org/papers/quickbms.zip](http://aluigi.org/papers/quickbms.zip)

6.Get FFXIII BMS script:
[http://aluigi.org/papers/bms/ff13.bms](http://aluigi.org/papers/bms/ff13.bms)

7. Run Quickbms to extract all the files

8. Get Señor Casaroja's Noesis:
[http://oasis.xentax.com/index.php?content=downloads](http://oasis.xentax.com/index.php?content=downloads)

9. Run Noesis and look under the "chr" directory in the extracted data.

10. File -> Export ->.

11. Set "Main output type:" and "Additional animation output:" to Collada

12. If you use 3ds Max or Maya, download the OpenCollada plugins here:
[http://www.opencollada.org/download.html](http://www.opencollada.org/download.html)
(Autodesk's Collada plugins have serious problems)

If you're after the Zones, I posted the directions on page 19.

You can do it with either X360 or PS3 version of the game, if you use PS3 version files you need to rename them to be like those of X360 version's, they will work.

You can get PS3 mesh, but not textures. If you don't want to go and get the 360 version, try sending your PS3 files to MrAdults. He might be able to help.

I'll have to look at that someday.

The meshes are exactly the same, so I'd imagine textures are the same too.

Just so everyone knows, Blender 2.58 (released 22 June) fixed the problem with the Collada importer not importing bone names correctly.
No more "VisualSceneNodeXXX" for bone names.

TheDude,
   thanks for your explanations and assisitance, I was messing around with the Summons folder and was trying to get at the Hecatoncheir model, when I open it in Noesis, it doesn't have any texture applied.

I used the settings you recommended, but there weren't any texture files output after the export (Which makes sense when I think about it, there was no texture to output in the first place). 
This [http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-DPAm_ImakZI/T ... oesis2.png](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-DPAm_ImakZI/TgfznFVXofI/AAAAAAAAAKY/d4NjxKLHREk/s1600/hec_issue_noesis2.png) shows what I was dealing with in Noesis.  


The s501.x360out is the result of using the recommended settings. By default, only the s501.x360.imgb, and s501.x360.trb were in the folder.

 It looks like all the summons have their textures when viewed in Noesis, except Hecatoncheir and Alexander(these two model's imgb files are of size 0 kb)  I'm guessing that is the issue.

I was wondering if you or anyone else has run into this issue with hecatoncheir?

I have used noesis and I open the models and they look fine to me textured etc so when I go to export or export from preview and select both obj or collada they export fine but when I get them into Lightwave or 3dsmax there are never any UV maps or like in lightwave the materials are there but nothing is assigned to anything and the uvs are all screwed up. What am I doing wrong?

i always run OBJ's through Deep exploration to convert them to LWO as importing none LW formats often seems to loose ( or not load ) texture and or Maps ( uv,weight and or morph ) plus Deep Ex seems to handle the surfaces conversions way better than that just trying to import an OBJ. Also if it does drop any of the materials during export to obj you can always reassign then in deep ex before converting to lwo. As a general rule of thumb ill never IMPORT formats into Lightwave ill always convert them to LWO before hand.

I have a question. Anyone tried to make an animation of FFXIII modl by using 3DS Max ?
I try to make animation with these bone with model that i have extracted , but i only can move the bone, the mesh not move.
To fix it, i always reattach bone to the model, it wastes many time  

If anyone dont have the problem like me , tell me some way to fix the model.
Thank in advanced.

I think as long as you export as DAE and under the options select DAE for output in NOESIS it should work.  When I move the bones they remain in place.
hope this helps

Make sure you install the OpenCOLLADA plugin for Max. Also when you import into Max, make you you specify the OpenCOLLADA plugin otherwise it defaults to Autodesk's own Collada plugin which has issues.

Anyone try to export .dae to .smd and import it to Milkshape 3d ? I export model to smd and i always get very big bone.
That happens in Maya and Softimage too. You can fix it manually, but that's the only way I know.
That's also why I'm sticking with Blender 2.5 and 3ds Max - with those 2 everything just works.

In case people don't know, you can use Noesis to extract from FFXIII XBOX 360 version if you extract the system files using Xbox image browser

wpd files seem to be some kind of archive/filelist type, as .xfv, .xgr (gui), .grs (gui), .wpd (duh -_-, sound), .wdb and the mot .bin files

.XFV Files seem to have a different offset, the rest uses the same offsets
header 00000000, 00 to 02 -> WPD
offset 00000963, 03 -> list of files (mysterious)

I can see a pattern in some files with 'WPD' as their header, they seem to lead to different white_ files

the mot .bin files look like a combined filelist + white to me

----
.clb files seem to be a compiled/encrypted code type
----

If only i could program C. (or understand how .bms files work)

Hi everyone,

I would like to know if someone have a link or upload the animation of all the characters/ennemies/boss/eidolons of FFXIII, please ?

In fact, I would like to open it on 3DSMAX 2012, please.

I have also the Blu-Ray of FFXIII for PS3 : if someone can tell me how to do, please ?

Thanks a lot everyone

I just felt like you could use some harassing.   



But on a more serious note, I tried the information on page 3, but when I tried those divisors the meshes weren't the right size.
I had to calculate the difference in size between the raw BBs and the mesh AABBs in the files.
Just curious if you went about it a different, possibly better, way.

My wife keeps them under lock and key.

I'm not sure what "divisors" you're referring to. I recall there being some chunks mixed in with the bbox chunks that you would think would be scale+bias chunks, but they didn't seem to be. Using them to center the model gave you something close to but not actually center. I also remember that the models were clearly meant to be scale+biased from reading the vertex programs. But I resorted to the same hack of using the vertex bounds to center the model using the bbox chunk bounds.

The right way to do it is probably to use some scale+bias values from some other file(s). Either that or I missed the ones in the SEDB file, but I don't think so, I'd documented it pretty much byte for byte. But then, it has been over 3 years now, so I dunno.

I just looked back at a TRB, I was mistaken, you can pretty easily use those COMP chunks to correctly scale+bias without fucking around with bounds at all.

This is what I meant, although I may have misunderstood:

Yes, I'm using the COMP for the bias and the MESH AABBs for the scale.
Seems to work OK so far.......

Anyway, I felt like learning the Maya and Softimage APIs for some reason (no idea why).
Obviously I wanted to work with something I was halfway interested in, hence all this mayhem and foolishness.

I meant, it looks like COMP can be used to scale too. It works out just right cause they scale the box it provides with the mesh. I'll fix up the old trb loader to use it after work tonight.

Hmm, I hadn't tried that.
I figured it was working fine so I didn't bother investigating any further.
I'm fighting with Maya's skinning code right now. It was a lot simpler in Max.

It worked fine with the COMP chunks, the environments are all loaded correctly in Noesis now. Also, chrrox told me you had to assign all those materials manually, so I decided to try to get the Noesis material mapping to work a bit better. Barring actual shader emulation, the best thing would be to chart out the sampler mappings for all of the base shader types, and that will reliably give you your appropriate diffuse/normal/spec/hair offset/etc. maps. But I can't be assed to do that, so I just try to guess based on the texture and shader names. New default material settings in the Noesis preview:

It applies appropriate material settings for skin and hair now as well. Hopefully, this will keep you away from my balls for now.

Sweet Baby Jesus!!!
You the man Mr. Adults!
Maybe in another 10 or 20 years I'll know as much as you.........."maybe"

Now if I could just get the energy to finish mine...... 

EDIT: Here's a Noesis plugin for the PS3 xgr files:
View - [http://www.mediafire.com/view/1czn3klwz ... XGR_XFV.py](http://www.mediafire.com/view/1czn3klwz4naimq/FF13_XGR_XFV.py)
Download - [http://www.mediafire.com/download/1czn3 ... XGR_XFV.py](http://www.mediafire.com/download/1czn3klwz4naimq/FF13_XGR_XFV.py)


EDIT 2: I wasn't paying attention and gave those 2 lists global scope causing the textures to add up if you look
at multiple files without closing Noesis. Just move them under XGRLoadTextures to fix that.  

EDIT 3: Fixed stuff n junk, updated link. Type 4 format is morton-order tiled a8r8g8b8

EDIT 4: Added support for xfv files

Nice work, I was able to look at some of the battle GUI elements and its quite fascinating how they have done them. There seem to be a lot of .xfv files accompanied by .imgb files in the vfx folder for example, have you had a chance to look into those yet?

OK, I updated the link above.
I only tested out a few files though so I'm not sure it works for everything.

Im happy to report that most of the XFV's work right off the bat, but there are a few, especially any in the common folder thats inside the VFX folder, where they do not show any data in the preview.

So what format next? XD (jk)

All the imgb files I see under the "common" directory are 0 byte files, i.e., no textures.
The xfv files look like they're for visual effects and not all of them necessarily use textures.

hi, newbie here (both 3D models and 3dsmax)..

i just following guides/hint from this forums and finally i can import Lightning model to 3dsmax (export to .dae from Noesis and import using OpenCOLLADA)

i read from this forum how to fix alpha/tranparency for the models by applying each map to their "Opacity" and most of them fixed beautifully. however i can't seems to fix Lightning's eyelash transparency, and it's driving me crazy   



anyone can help?
Thank You

TheDude: You might wanna update your script to use the new Noesis rapi.imageFromMortonOrder function, it's faster and will handle badly-sized images too. Usage is rgbaPix = rapi.imageFromMortonOrder(rgbaPix, width, height). You can specify an optional argument too after height, if you want to force a byte stride, it will otherwise determine it based on the size of the data and the image dimensions. You can shift the width/height and force a byte stride to do stuff like untile DXT blocks, which isn't necessary for PS3 but is done on some other platforms.

flarespire: There are no PS3-specific UV issues that I'm aware of. In the case of FF13-2 the UV's are stored in the image bundle, which means if you have the wrong imgb your UV's will be wrong and probably complete garbage.

that's the issue though, i used the file list file to extract the white_imgu.ps3.bin file, and it came out exactly the same as the xbox360's would as well as the imgb's having valid image data that's identical to the xbox 360's its just that the UV mapping for the ps3 files (in both XIII and XIII-2) is completely F.U.B.A.R. compared to the xbox 360's files.

on the subject of file lists, has anyone cracked XIII-2's yet?

@Mr Adults, Yeah I saw the update. I just keep forgetting to do that. Thanks for reminding me.

I personally haven't had any issues with the PS3 data using Noesis or my own Autodesk importers.
As far as Noesis goes, I've always used the FBX format since it was added; not sure if that makes any difference.

Here's the 3DS Max material setup.

As an aside, this is a lot more straight forward in Softimage and Lightwave.
Lightwave especially since it comes from a video production background and automatically looks at the green channel.

FYI, you also don't need to be doing anything with RPG contexts there. That stuff is only for the RPG geometry interface, which you aren't actually using.

I probably copied a bunch of junk from something else I was playing with.

EDIT: Animation WIP

Update: Most of the data is quaternion curves with a few constant and linear curves thrown in for flavor.

Nice bit of progress there Dude. Although i was just wondering how you were going to get noesis to load the corresponding animation for a model or vice versa...

Well I'm doing Autodesk products first,i.e., Maya, 3ds Max, Softimage, and maybe Motion Builder.
(I'm stuck in a Autodesk rut for some reason) Then I'll make a plugin for Noesis.
I have a lackadaisical way of going about things so it way be a while longer.... [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TE_oIIIwWl0](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TE_oIIIwWl0)
Also, I'm totally cheating. This was all figured out 3 years ago. [https://github.com/nohbdy/ffxivmodelvie ... /Animation](https://github.com/nohbdy/ffxivmodelviewer/tree/master/src/DatDigger/Sections/Animation)

Anyway, looks like the quaternion decompression works:

Well, I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong here.

Edit: I was using the wrong model. Looks like the 2xx models (PCs) are the animated ones. Poor Vanille is still a twisted mess, but her legs look fantastic!   
Animated perfectly and everything. Looks like I missed coding some things - have to redo a bunch of junk.

MediaFire is retarded. Upload (seriously) copyrighted material - they don't care.
Upload python code or a simple file list - "file has been deleted and a strike has been placed against your account."

Whatever, I moved everything to my Skydrive: [https://skydrive.live.com/redir?resid=5 ... EADBF2!560](https://skydrive.live.com/redir?resid=5563CAB21EADBF2!560)
Somewhere in the middle is a playblast of my zombie Vanille. Even that I had to fat-finger the rotation values a bit.
The files for it are FF13_Maya and Vanille_anim.
You'll have to place c205.ps3.trb and c205.ps3.bin in the same directory if you want to putz around with it or
maybe figure out the 1000 things I'm doing wrong.  

UPDATE: So you have to use joint orientation and NOT rotation. ◖|◔◡◉|◗ <Huuuuur
Did I mention I'm a total noob and never imported animation data before.....?

It's a good thing you watermarked that image with the URL for this thread, I would hate to see people not giving proper recognition to whoever the guy was that bothered to figure out those animations 3 years ago. By coming here and reading through this entire thread and seeing where you briefly referenced his source code. Good thinking ahead.

I was just making fun of the watermark, cause I don't think anyone even remotely cares either way. Except the people waiting to be able to easily rip those animations and put them in a Half-Life mod or masturbate to them in their dark, lonely bedrooms. Which is why I work on Noesis, to fuel the dark lonely masturbators of the world. Those people that are so twisted that they've gone beyond touching themselves to digital representations of non-fictional females, to a place where there is no longer even of a vague or abstract sense of reality.

QFT.

But seriously, nice work Dude, have you had this work with any other models yet or was Vanille just the Guinea Pig for this?

@zaykho
That's pretty cool man.   

@MrAdults
Damnit! I almost soiled myself laughing!   

@flarespire
Yeah, I was just using Vanille for a Guinea Pig.

Still have some things to work out though.
Maya's ignoring the New curve default in the animation preferences, which I set to Quaternion SLERP.
So to fix a few "wild" bones you have to use the graph editor and manually change the interpolation type for the curves.
When I tried scripting it instead, it messed up the whole animation. I might have done it wrong - not sure.
Some bones just can't be fixed though. At the same time it seems inconsistent.
Scrubbing through the animation there will be something wrong at frame #17.
Then when you go back there is no problem - it's at a different frame.
I'll try it in Softimage and 3ds Max and see what happens there. Plus chrrox offered to do the Noesis port.

Maya is evil.
"It scares the horses, kills puppies, hides the remote,.... really sick shit."

I tried to slow this down AND make it smooth, but the rotations are too extreme in too short of a time - it was made to be fast!

Awesome work, that sure explains alot about the gunblade, have you bee able to get anymore animation data for it working, like the transformation between sword and gun?

They should all work, minus manually fixing some things afterword.
I just need to learn some PyQT and make an import menu for the animation selection.

Newest Noesis supports FF13 anims. 

It will automatically look up to find the corresponding model when you load an animation, assuming you have the original FF13 archive file structure in place. If it can't find the TRB on its own, it'll prompt you for it. Works perfectly on all the characters/monsters/summons/etc. I've tried with it.

I've tried to load the other weapon models, like the Omega Weapon with the gunblades anim but every time I do it comes up saying it cant be viewed but may be exportable, is it supposed to be doing that (I purposely copied the anims and models to another location to do this BTW)

Guess all i can do is keep playing around with the animations in 3ds max.

On a related not, im guessing that the next logical step is to work on the FFXIII-2 filelist file so we can get the original file structures of that game and start working on that games files a little more...

Also, you will find some anim sequences where the character appears to be balled up or otherwise screwed up. Those aren't actually broken. They're meant to stack with an existing pose. There isn't a lot of point in trying to apply them, but all you need to do is a straight transform on top of another pose. (if doing so from Noesis output, first switch any unused channels from the base default to identity)

Figured the weapon animations issue i was having out, you need to make a copy of the animation folder and rename it to match the corresponding weapon folder. for example, sk_w101_lt would be copied and renamed as so, sk_w461_lt, to view the animations on the omega weapon model.

Hi all, sorry to jump in with this out of the blue, but if anyone knows the answer id be really grateful.
I have the PS3 version of the game, and there is a quickbms script for it for the PS3, I tried that two years ago, and I never got any success in extracting anything from it, so I gave up, now that animations are supported, I would like to try again, but still same error like over two years ago, nothing has changed.

This is what I try to do, and still nothing.

```

- select the BMS script or plugin to use
- select the input archives/files to extract, type * or "" for whole folder and
subfolders
- select the output folder where extracting the files
- open input file E:\dev_bdvd\PS3_GAME\USRDIR\white_data\sys\white_imgu.ps3.bin
- open script E:\dev_bdvd\PS3_GAME\USRDIR\white_data\sys\ff13.bms
- set output folder E:\dev_bdvd\PS3_GAME\USRDIR\white_data\sys\extracted

  offset           filesize   filename
--------------------------------------
  coverage file 0     0%   0          1573978112
- open input file E:\dev_bdvd\PS3_GAME\USRDIR\white_data\sys\extracted\filelist_
imgu.ps3.bin

- error in src\file.h line 213: myfopen()
Error: No such file or directory

Press RETURN to quit
```


The folder structure is the same, as it was transferred via FTP str8 from the BDGame.
if anyone knows the solution, please advise or point me to the right direction, thank you.

I'm not sure what is your trying to say.
Apparently it supports only the Xbox 360 version of the game, even if I rename the files to have the x360 still nothing to even look at the .bin contents.

although I've read this thread twice, still nothing related the problem I experience.

Well, I obviously am doing something wrong, since it doe not do anything for my PS3 files version, if you could kindly explain in few steps what needs to be done would be awesome, thank you.

I mean how to extract the assets with in .bin from the PS3 version, the rest its pretty simple I guess.

EDIT:

With more careful determination and perseverance I guess I figured it out.

If i remember rightly, you need to extract the ISO file using Noesis, and then rename the file: filelistu.ps3.bin to filelist_imgu.ps3.bin and open it in noesis and press the OK button and when it prompts you open white_imgu.ps3.bin through the window that has opened and it will extract all the files in the white_imgu.ps3.bin file using the filelist_imgu.ps3.bin to get all the files in the appropriate file and folder structure. If you are using the actual Blu-Ray disc to find the files then you need to set the output folder to another drive inside a folder to keep everything together.

Edit: Ill just leave this here as well then:

There is no need to rename anything, no file, leave all just as is.
Inside the PS3 BDGame disc the files in the dev_bdvd\PS3_GAME\USRDIR\white_data\Sys or Sys2 folders are.

filelist_scru.ps3.bin
filelistu.ps3.bin
white_imgu.ps3.bin
white_scru.ps3.sdat

I extracted them using FTP from the BDGame, using the PS3, to a HDD on my PC.

Opened up Noesis, I navigated inside sys folder selecting to open the list file filelistu.ps3.bin, then Nosesis will prompt you to select the Data file that needs to be extracted, thus selecting white_imgu.ps3.bin, then hitting ok, the extraction begins.
everything will be extracted in a folder called filelistu.ps3_files inside sys folder.
with its 12 subfolders.

Now there is a trick, those who want to use that animation data inside mot folder, when you select the .bin animation file it will load automatically its .trb model, but those in low poly, I suggest to all who want to take advantage of the high poly models, change the chr folder location else where, once you try to load the animation it will not find the required .trb, and will prompt you to select it, there for select the high poly .trb ones of the models, they look bad enough so the low poly makes it even worse.

I was going from a slightly older procedure for extracting the bin files.

EDIT: also there is no need to move any model files elsewhere all you need to do is make a copy of the animations folder in the right directory and rename it to match the model number in the chr folder. for example, i want to view the Omega Weapon with the gunblade animations, so i copy the folder sk_w101_lt (i think its this one) and paste it in the same folder so i get sk_w101_lt (2). From here all i need to do is rename it to the following: sk_w461_lt. When i load an animation from the folder we have just renamed in noesis, it will load the Omega Weapon model instead of the normal Blazefire Sabre (default gunblade) model.

Cool, I'll have to give it a try, so far PS3 animations seem to be mostly screwed compared to my friends XBOX version (I had to borough his disc, I couldn't resist now that animations are available, to compare both versions, PS3 has a lot of mess, not all can be read easily like the XBOX), and if I try to make them load the high poly model characters, oh lord what a mess it is.

Has anyone figured out where is the Odin transformation? I looked but some seem to move so fast I could not tell.
And how can we separate them by segments since all are in same file.

I suggest you go and download a new version of Noesis, as im using the PS3 files and 99% of the animations play flawlessly.

I do have the latest one, noesisv40955
And they are mostly screwed up, while loading the high poly models that is.

then that's probably because the high poly models have a different skeletal rig, which means that there is nothing wrong with the animations or models, they were just never meant to be used together in that way. There may be a set of animation data for the high poly models but the ones that extracted are high poly enough.

Yeah, to have a smooth game play during battle along with the animation they are paired with the low poly models, but must be a vertex order or something, since it loads the models but it screws up the mesh like its exploded, or something, it expects a certain order and being high poly has no clue what to do with the extra information and gets exploded. oh well.

have you figured out Odin's transformation?

If you press the button that looks like rewind ( << ), then you can slow down the animations to view them better. But as of what I've seen, neither S1.white.x360.bin nor s2.white.x360.bin look like they show the transformation.  I'm looking at just FFXIII though...

I did that too with the slider for the animation, there is no real transformation happening, just jumps from a T pose frame to a action frame in a split second.
FFXIII-2 also has couple of extra animations for odin, he's probably the most creative and unique half and half game creature I've ever seen so far, that transforms.

As the transformation occurs as an in battle cutscene which then triggers a model swap, im guessing its somewhere in the battle scene files, instead of odins actual animation files.

OK so ive found out something rather annoying with the way 13-2's weapons are set up. Apparently the base model has no UV mapping and is using dummy textures when viewed, and the game loads a different imgb file to the model when called to, however, when you try to do this manually with noesis, it does not work... any ideas?

You are not looking hard enough. They are just lying there.

But as you can see, the text is heavily stuffed with time & format modifiers. It would take a lot of effect to handle them.
Besides, the game itself comes with 8 major languages, what language do you need to translate to?

Of course there is no such tool to the date.

But well technically that is not true, there indeed is one at least, but you won't get it unless you are a SE employee or a friend of a SE employee.
That's why there are so many model modding videos of FFXIII on internet but they wouldn't dare to release the tool or method how they made it.
Because they didn't make it all by themselves. They had the helping hand from inside that they can't talk/disclose.

Hey all,

There's been some minor progress on the PC port front, as there's a repacker in development, but I need some info on .trb. .imgb/.xfv/.xgr opens fine through Noesis, but neither Noesis extraction, nor any of thedude's max/maya importers are working with .trb's extracted from the PC version, even from QuickBMS.

Here's the new tool, by Sectus over on NeoGAF:

[http://www.tzarsectus.com/tools/ff13tool.rar](http://www.tzarsectus.com/tools/ff13tool.rar)

Source:

[http://www.tzarsectus.com/tools/source/ff13tool.rar](http://www.tzarsectus.com/tools/source/ff13tool.rar)

This will be able to Extract the files much like QBMS does, but will also do repacking!

Next up for us is getting a tool for .imgb and .xgr/.xfv, and then we can start examining the .trb format changes. 

If anyone has any information on how those formats work (If only TheDude would abide.. ), please reply or send a PM, and I can relay messages to Sectus (And Durante. Yes, *that* Durante.)

The UV have been moved into the vertex info stride.  The rest of the "mesh" parts are the same.  Not sure about the other blocks.

The model formats weren't really messed with. They just changed the shaders/materials for PC.
The SEDBwrb section is exactly the same. That's why the importers I made a year+ ago still work - I never messed with the material data.
I did just add an importer for Blender 2.73 though.
Here's all the junk: [https://app.box.com/s/xs87k7b1zxj0xu07x4k2f27vxuz56k58](https://app.box.com/s/xs87k7b1zxj0xu07x4k2f27vxuz56k58)

Hope it's not too much to ask, but would an exporter be possible? I'd like to improve some of the meshes and put them back into the game. Or use the cinematic models in regular play. I tried regular file swapping and well...

You're right. Somemariokartone should make an exporter.  
I don't think I have the skill to pull it off.

Besides, I wasted most of my free time the last two weeks trying to import animation data in Blender 2.73 and gave up.
The last thing I want to do right now is look at code.  

I know how to change the animation so it will work on the high poly models if anyone wants to do the grunt work and take all the credit and glory.

Eh, I'm not so sure that's all that changed, honestly.
Perhaps it's little more than an endian switch, but something is definitely off with the PC models, at least for XIII-2.

Also does anyone have contact with the person who did FFXIIITool, or is anyone here familiar with how it works? I've been slowly chipping away at the XIII-2 file formats and figuring out how the game handles everything and I've just about hit a point now where I feel like some serious modding for the game is possible. The problem is, the current way we repack the IMG files doesn't allow for additional files to be added.. For a proper modding interface we'd need a way to append new files, not just overwrite old ones.

Sorry, I didn't mean there was an issue with your importer, perhaps I should have clarified better.
There are some subtle differences in the model and texture container that I haven't really figured out yet, as you noted it's not a major change as your importer still works fine, but on the other hand Noesis (as an example) crashes outright when it attempts to load anything from the PC versions. Likewise neither of the console versions TRB's seem to matchup with the PC versions, there's something minor that's changed and it's enough to cause mild frustration.

Anyway, yes that's the tool. I believe it was posted somewhere on this forum before too. It can extract files from the IMG containers and repack a new container (or append a modified file at the end of an existing container) - but it doesn't seem capable of adding new files. I was hoping to glean some light on how it works and see how feasible it would be to add new files to the containers.. It would be a great boon toward modding the game, especially with all the research I've recently done on the game.. I feel like with the right packaging tools and my findings, the road toward modding the game could be paved.

OK, I see what you're saying.
Actually it's funny you mentioned that because I just noticed some problems with my importers.  

Did you try the texture dumper I made for Blender?
Obviously the PC textures aren't tiled so all I did was comment out the code that byte-swaps and untiles the data.

I haven't yet, no. I've been busy documenting a lot on the PC version and preparing a demonstration of modding capability.
It'd be nice if we had a way to import models back into the TRB's though.. Technically IMGB injection should be easy as hell, since they're basically just packaged DDS textures, I've had some success adding textures this way manually. I just wish there was more interest in all of this, it'd be nice to have some help.

I mentioned it a while back, but don't forget about nohbdy's GitHub repo: [https://github.com/nohbdy/ffxivmodelvie ... r/Sections](https://github.com/nohbdy/ffxivmodelviewer/tree/master/src/DatDigger/Sections)

It'd be nice if we had a way to import models back into the TRB's though.. Technically IMGB injection should be easy as hell, since they're basically just packaged DDS textures, I've had some success adding textures this way manually. I just wish there was more interest in all of this, it'd be nice to have some help.

Hi Krisan.

the trb main structure is very simple to rebuild.  Its the pesky node based SEDBwrb block that is a pain in the ass to repack.  I don't even know if it could be called node based, but whatever it is, its pretty messy.  

```
-->MDL
---->MESH
------->STMS
------->STMS
---->MESH
------->STMS
------->STMS
-->MDL
---->MESH
------->STMS
------->STMS

```

Its like each block points to the next block.
I had an idea for repacking these files, but I haven't tried it yet.
It would go something like this.

1. package imgb files.
2. Write SEDBtxb blocks
3. Write STMS uv data
4. Write STMS vertex position data, (also write whatever else STMS is talking about, normals, weights?)
5. Write new weird WRB (node/tree/pointer to pointer to pointer crap)
6. Write the new trb header and table using the old SEDBshd and other blocks besides the newly created SEDBtxb and SEDBwrb 
---(theres a random looking padding after the last SEDBtxb block, it may need to be preserved)
7. Write data blocks

Aye, I noticed after some experimentation myself that it seemed kind of node-based like this. Good to have confirmation though.
A took like this would be fantastic to have honestly, I've discovered enough about the engine thus far elsewhere that it wouldn't be too terribly difficult to setup new costumes (as opposed to replacing current ones) for Serah and Noel. It'd also be nice to have a better understanding of the skeletal setup as well, as there are a few instances where a skeletal swap from one model to another could solve a myriad of problems..

> I know how to change the animation so it will work on the high poly models if anyone wants to do the grunt work and take all the credit and glory.
Can that be achieved only by those who know how to code? or a simple user like me can do it? id sure like to try if its not complicated.
If so, will it be able to be used with noesis, to have full animation support on high poly models?
