- Post Title: Importing custom models / animations Kingdom Hearts 2

I've been working on a ROM hack mod for Kingdom Hearts 2 Final Mix that replaces Sora as the player character, I've been able to extract the .mdlx and .aset/.mset files so that I can edit the models and animations, though I haven't been able to find a way to convert the edited files back into the formats used by the game.

Is there any tool or method that I can use to do this?

I have the same problem, there's alot of neat mods lately on the web changing the main character, and I wanted to try do something similar myself too, but I had no luck in finding a way to convert .fbx (or any other 3d model) into .mdlx

Anyone knows something we don't?   

P.S. i think there's some plugin for Noesis or something like that, but I can't find it.
