For current work on this game, please see the Soul Calibur 3 megathread.

Hi!
I've been desperately searching for a way to rip the SC3 character creation models. Is this possible specially? Or can you only rip the main models?
I'm willing to do anything at this point.

Hi, MarioSonicU!
Is this a single model or a single mesh?
and to properly get this into a editable format (.3ds, etc.) I'd have to use that Quickbms method?
