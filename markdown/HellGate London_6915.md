Hmm, seems it got some new models too after changing hands 

Only unusual thing is some of the normal maps have got the usual left-right info in the alpha channel which is no problem to fix but in some of the others all the channels are identical.

No big deal anyway, can just tidy them, bump and then convert to normals later with the plugin.

The hellgate_graphicshigh file has a few nice models in it going by the textures but they've got an .am extension and seem to have a different structure (from what my poor knowledge of hex could see) when I checked them in hex workshop.

thanks again for the script!

Foxtrot -- I don't believe there is currenty any method for exporting wm files. There is a good tool for modding the hellgate packages, but I think you'll be limited to texture edits of the existent models.

Hé, euh Chrrox, maybe it is me, but what do you mean, the tool for the archive is 
[http://reanimator.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/common/](http://reanimator.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/common/) ??

There is no exe or anything, do I need to download these files and build them or something?

Just build it in visual C# .
Though the strange thing is that I sort of expect them to have a release version already, judging from their instructions

Hey guys, 

I wanted to get the 3D models from Hellgate London, but neither the link to the max script nor the link to the extractor works anymore. 
I am really not the most experienced person with ripping files, so is there another way to get to those models?
Or does anyone still have active links? 
Alternatively, if I am doing something wrong, please tell me too. 

Thanks in advance!

Hey, the script for *.wm models is in the .rar file in chrrox' opening post.  

And google/bing is your friend, isn't it?

Sorry to bother you again.

So I´ve successfully gotten the xml. file that I need, unfortunately using the Hellpack.exe only gives me an error that part of the path couldn't be found. 
Any idea what might cause this? 
Or am I just using things wrong?

Thanks for your help.
