- Post Title: How do I rip texture from Vagrant Story?

I wanna do my own texture "upscaling".
But from what I've gathered you need to finish the game before you can the full set of texture using emulators like Beetle or Duckstation. 
But I never replay games that I've already played. 
So is there a way or software where I can rip out the textures? 
So that I can upscale it and play and enjoy it fully?
