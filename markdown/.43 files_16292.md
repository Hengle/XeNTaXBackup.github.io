- Post Title: .43 files?

Alright

Here is my problem.

I have ripped many .43 meshes but 43toOBJ does not work. I am a noob. Can you convert .43 files to a more common 3d model format like .dae, obj, fbx, 3ds, mb, ma, mlt, blend, stl, or ply?

If you do so, thanks.

here are the files: [https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B8Tdc ... V9tcnR5bGs](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B8TdcvcEJDiNcWlpMV9tcnR5bGs)

Anyways, .43 is pretty simple, so hex2obj works like a charm:

There was a Noesis script, too, iirc. (Use forum search: [viewtopic.php?f=10&t=14678&p=120687&hil ... 00#p120687](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=14678&p=120687&hilit=unity+finale00#p120687))
