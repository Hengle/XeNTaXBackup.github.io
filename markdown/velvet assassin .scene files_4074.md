Is there anything on this? I'd like to get Violette's Leather outfit but this thread is all there is when it comes to model extracting from the game and everything's deleted or dead. Can someone please restore the links and help others out here?

Turns out the archive at [www.p3dm.ru](http://www.p3dm.ru) does have the leather outfit model there too, however the model is not rigged.

Oh I wasn't aware, didn't see it in the picture so I assumed it was not included or something. Still though, I've seen uploads of her on Deviantart that are rigged so there still has to be a way of getting this last outfit with a rig, does no one have the blender importer to import stuff from the game anymore?...I suppose I could just skinwrap it to other rigged models off of DA but it won't be as good as it originally could have been.
