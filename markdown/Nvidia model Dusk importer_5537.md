Wow!

You really have some python/blender Skills

I have been waiting for someone to convert the nvidia demo models for ages (besides the Dawn Model).

While you're on a roll, can you also consider the Luna demo model? personally I think she's the best model of all their demos.

Amazing Work!

Working really good for Dusk Non Ultra with just a few small bugs, but this could be something I'm doing wrong on my end.

I will redo this and double check what the minor problems are.



EDIT:

I had first thought that some mesh pieces were missing, but it turns out that everything is there, it's just that many small pieces are imported at origin 0,0,0
and hidden inside the body, The pieces I see hidden are the eyeballs and corneas, upper and lower teeth, 4 butterflies with their wings, fingernails, shoes, plus about 6 dozen undetermined parts.
and if you look closely you can notice the tiny parts that make up the corners of the eyes, but these are not imported at 0,0,0.

I don't know if this is something that could easily be handled within the script or not, but I just thought I'd mention it  just in case.

I googled PipeDream, and it would seem it was an ATi tech demo.... different from the nvidia formats.

K, fixed up my old script for the human head demo, so that it would import from the other NMBs. 
this time instead of grabbing the text names in the NMB, I scaned for the ID tags for each section. 

I've never dealt with this sort of ID driven format before, and I'm a n00b to scripting/programming. so no surprise the script is very slow on import.

unfortunately the madussa NMBs are alot different then the fore-mentioned NMBs.. different variable sizes, and alot of extra text information for materials. also I saw alot of weird padding through out the file :\ 

Here's some screenshots:








I really love the Luna suit, that effect is pretty much pulled off by a single mask texture O_O



also the nalu model is the same model that nvidia used in dawn and dusk.. that model on its own seems to have been used in other 3d softwares.
most notably a game called "dreamstrippers" not sure where the dawn model first originated, but its been used in other things too.

Awesome! Mariokart64n,

This is Great Work!
Also, your renders are incredible!

BTW: The creator of the Dawn model is Steven Giesler.
I remember seeing the model used for Dreamstrippers and saying to myself that is the same model used in nvidia's demos (weird).
but.. look up Steven Geisler (He was also involved in creating models from the FF Movie) and you'll realize he probably had nothing to do with this dreamstripper game.  

Edit:

Can you post your updated script here?

Yeah, I'd like to see an updated script as well.
I can't import Luna with the script as posted in this thread [viewtopic.php?f=16&t=4764](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=4764)
(using 3DSmax 2008).

I first thought of the mesh, and some were missing, but it turned out, everything is there, it's just a lot of small pieces of the origin of imports and the body hidden in the 0,0,0, I see the hidden part of the eye, cornea, the upper and lower teeth, 4 wings, nails, shoes, plus about 6 dozen undecided part of the butterfly.

Thanks, that one worked. Seems like weighting is screwed though. 
Also, a lot of junk data is generated by the script.
