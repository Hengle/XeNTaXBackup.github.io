- Post Title: Artifact - Modding Cards

File formats are VPK and vtex_c

The VPK file is the game files package, the vtex_c contains the image and information. the vtex_c file can be exported to a png file with the tool Valve Resource Viewer 

There is a tool called VPK creator and a method to tell a Source 2 game to prioritize a self-made VPK file (Example for Dota: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzoWT3P8ypk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzoWT3P8ypk))

However, the main issue is to turn an edited image file back into the vtex_c format.

Can't attach files for some reason so here's an example of a vtex_c file but i think if you don't own the game it is hard to understand how it works anyway.
