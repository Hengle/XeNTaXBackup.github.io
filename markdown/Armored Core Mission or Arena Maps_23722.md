- Post Title: Armored Core Mission or Arena Maps

Greetings,

I was wondering if anyone could point me in the direction of modifying any of the Armored Core games Mission or Arena maps. I've done quite a bit of editing of Final Fantasy Tactics maps ([https://ffhacktics.com/smf/index.php?topic=12678.0](https://ffhacktics.com/smf/index.php?topic=12678.0)) and want to see if I can mod another favorite game series of mine.

Thanks in advance!
