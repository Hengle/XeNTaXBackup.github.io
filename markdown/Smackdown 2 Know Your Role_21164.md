Hey guys

First post on the forum, so a quick hi.
I'm wondering if anybody may be able to help me locate a fairly decent model of Dante from dmc4. I'm a cg artist who uses 3ds max so may be able to help you guys with some obj testing to repay the favour.
I'm looking for a model posed or unposed, preferably with textures if poss his guns and sword would be a big bonus too!
Thanks in advance and keep up the good work
Sally,

What the hell does Dante have to do with Smackdown 2?
