- Post Title: Lego Star Wars III Building/Map files

Does anyone know where the map files are hiding like the buildings and what not? 
I used extractnxgmesh and Im not seeing anything other than sounds, character models/ random items so far. 
Looking for these assets exactly, the walls/rocks/buildings
