I'd love if somebody could work out the decompression files from this game. I liked some of the models very much.

So, no chance to decompress the files?

The game is built with Fancy3D engine, so trimmed aluigi's script for the engine archives will do. Extracted images has their own format though.

Could you tell me if there are ready-made scripts\tools for importing\converting these decompressed files (like .msh, .skn, .san, .tga, .bmp, etc)? 
Or will I have to reverse engineer the formats myself from scratch? Thanks.

@RedBear: I'm not sure, but maybe it's worth to look for some tools or scripts, related to the engine and other games on it (though I couldn't find any).
