- Post Title: Battleifled 4 Extraction script

So, the only files in the game folder with the big enough size is .cas files.
these are 1.05 gb's each file. (21 cas files)
these are most likely to contain the music/sound files.

does anyone had luck with extracting it so far?

Right now the script is having a small problem extracting VO and music, most of it extracts but not everything, if you were just looking for a particular song, I can help you out if you want, if you want the complete score you'll have to wait until frank finishes updating the script, then i could show you what to do it isn't all that complicated.

i really want the tracks that are in the changhai mission (the skyscraper mission)  and the mission where you are in the prison breaking out, such amazing beats in those songs.
can you maybe get them and upload them for me?

i'm truly greatfull!
