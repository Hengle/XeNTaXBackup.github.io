- Post Title: Cache facebook gameroom

Sorry, the question is off topic.
In what folder are downloaded games resources in facebook gameroom?
Installed with the help of facebook gameroom game Pirates of the Caribbean: Tides of War, but I do not know where the resources have downloaded from this game.

P.S. Sorry for my english, I use an interpreter.
