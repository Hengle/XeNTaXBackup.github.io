I have attached a BNK file for which I am attempting to extract the sound effects from; however, I have had no success with being able to do so. Doe anyone happen to know how to extract the sound files from this BNK file. It appears to have a BNKL header.

This is two years late, but I just had the same issue trying to open the .bnk files for 007:Agent Under Fire for the PS2. They also have the "BNKL" header.

There is a program called "Game Extractor" Try to open the .bnk files with it. It will fail, but it will also make another file called "Filename_decompressed.bnk" These decompressed .bnk files are actually openable in Foobar!
