- Post Title: For Honor .FORGE files

Hello 

I have spent a good 2-3 hours scouring the web looking to find a way to extract the .FORGE files from For Honor. 
What I have found is that they are encrypted and no one has been able to get into them. 

Being able to rig and 3D print some of these models would be pretty awesome.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Game objects for anyone looking to try their magic. 



My glad would be dope to print. 20220429194345_1.jpg (179.89 KiB) Viewed 243 times

This is something pretty much only daemon could do.

So I'll do this and hope for the best.

No, i'm not the only one who could do this.
And yes, I decrypted for honor archives some time ago, but not releasing any tools yet, because if i do, they will change encryption.

Someone sent me a request to download the files. Thought this was a lost cause
