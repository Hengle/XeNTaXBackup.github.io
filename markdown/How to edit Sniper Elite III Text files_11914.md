02. Translate something in the text file
03. Drag 'n' drop edited text file onto "sniperelite3_import" and I got this:

Drag the .asr file onto "sniperelite3_export" WITH "Asura HTXT" header. Do not delete the header.
Translate the extracted text file, and drag the translated text file onto "sniperelite3_import"

I didn't delete anything from anything.
Just did what I wrote earlier: dropped Menu_En.asr onto sniperelite3_export.exe. Got a text file. Translated something in it, and dropped it onto sniperelite3_import.exe and bamm: error.

I don't know, but you must drag the translated *.TXT* file onto sniperelite3_import.exe.

Which version are you using? X360, PS3? This is for only PC. And do not rename the extracted text file.
