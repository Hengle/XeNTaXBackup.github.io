I don't know yet either, I assume the song you want to add has to replace a song from the game, and the replacement song has to be the same size. I'm gonna try this out some time and I'll update you on it.

If someone else has the answer, great! I'd love to know as well!

I mentioned this in another thread, but you basically can't add songs to the game. Unless, of course, you know how to modify the song list, apply filters, edit names, basically work with hex code.

Maybe you could replace songs, though.
