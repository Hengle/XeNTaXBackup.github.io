- Post Title: Forever 7th Capital NPK file unpack

This game seems to use Netease's NeoX engine.

I unpacked the npk files for this game using some tools I found by searching.
However, most of the tools found so far failed to unpack. One tool succeeded, but the unpacked files do not have file names, so you have to find them one by one.
What I want to do is not simply take out the model, but I would like the file name to be there.

As an example the tool I used exports the texture file of the modeling as 016 model-010917-06223674-000421E2.png
Actual file name is assumed to be in the form 10018_m.png 

So, is there a tool that can edit the npk file or keep the file name and then unpack and repack it?


Sorry for my English is not good
