- Post Title: Elsword 3D Models (.KOM files, encrypted)

Hello! My name is Jade. I'm someone who likes to rig the 3d models for the game Elsword.

Recently there's been a change in the .KOM files which contain all the data for the game, and most of the files have been encrypted with a custom encryption, or at least this is what my friend told me, therefore we (as in me and my friends who love to rig them as well) cannot get the model files from the game anymore. 

For example, the new character-- Ain's-- KOM file, Data211, can be extracted with a script for QuickBMS but the output files, well...
It comes out as:
Mesh_Ain_ALE_Cash_Hair_Sorted.x.algo2.212414
When it should come out as:
Mesh_Ain_ALE_Cash_Hair_Sorted.x

[https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/ ... sp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B35cRVIqi8zmQVlEbkZvVjRFQUk?usp=sharing)
In that folder I have included a KOM file (Ain's model folder) and the QuickBMS script used to extract it.
If anyone could please open that kom file successfully, I'd be extremely happy, & so would all of my friends and all the community who likes to rig them as well. I don't know how I can compensate for this, but if I find a way I might.

(Reposted in what I think would be a more suitable category)

Edit: 
So now, the x files of KOMs can be opened, but textures are still encrypted. If someone would like a sample KOM, I will give it to them.

algorithm 2 is definitely encryption.
if you look at the size and compressed size they are nearly identical.
you could try to find the file you want in memory while playing the game or if you can find an old and new file that are the same we could compare them to see if its an easy encryption like xor.

Okay, I updated the folder with a (older) KOM (from the time when they were still extractable) that is extractable with that script, and the same KOM that is now unextractable. they are in the two different folders marked "Extract" and "Cannot Extract". I hope this goes easily for you. That KOM is the model files for the "Ara" female character. They will be in .X format and the textures will all be .TGA , anything else is useless to me. Really, I appreciate this. Thank you.
