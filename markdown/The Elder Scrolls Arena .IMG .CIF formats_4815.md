- Post Title: The Elder Scrolls: Arena .IMG .CIF formats

I would like to request help with some graphic formats from The Elder Scrolls Arena, they
are .IMG files and .CIF files, My aim is to find a way to be able to view and re-save them in
their original formats if they've been modified. I've also included the palettes with the files.

Sample Files:
