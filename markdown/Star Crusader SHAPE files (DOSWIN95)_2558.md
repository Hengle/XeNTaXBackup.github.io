- Post Title: Star Crusader SHAPE files (DOS/WIN95)

I will give three shape files includeing their associate files. It is my belief they are a simple 3D format (early low-poly 3D).

The objects are:

ENTITY - A large weird looking squidlike thing.
EPOD - Escape Pod
CLOAK - Experimental cloak ship

I'll include more if needed.
