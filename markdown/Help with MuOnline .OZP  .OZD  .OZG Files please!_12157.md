Hi Karlitaki,
just open the .OZP files with a hex-editor, remove the first 4 bytes and save it as .PNG

ozg files seem to be compressed
using offzip -a -z -15  on ArkaBattleProgress.ozg creates 8 .dat files with less than 530 bytes each without senseful data imho.

(No time to dig deeper, sry.)

btw: thought I was deadly wrong using offzip with -15 as a parameter; 'coz some people used -a -z 15,
but if u enter offzip only it says: ...-15
