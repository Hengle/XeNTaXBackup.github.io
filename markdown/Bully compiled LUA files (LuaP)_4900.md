- Post Title: Bully compiled LUA files (LuaP)

Hi!
I need some help. I tried out some lua decompiler (LuaDec, LuaTools, etc...) but they aren't work for Bully's lua files. I've took a look with a hexeditor, and I have seen at the beginning of the files a part "LuaP" I tried to google after this, but I didn't found any useful for me. I hope there is somebody here, who can help with this compressed lua files.
I attached 2 sample file from the game.
Thanks, myers90
