You need to tell us more details like:
- What files are in this game? What are the file extensions?
- What are you trying to do? You want to translate this game? 
- What methods did you already tried to unpack the files? 

Also please upload samples and screenshots of the issue if possible.

Well, there are several already existing scripts and tools for UE4,
you should try them all first [https://zenhax.com/viewtopic.php?f=9&t= ... 251#p56251](https://zenhax.com/viewtopic.php?f=9&t=1005&p=56251#p56251)
