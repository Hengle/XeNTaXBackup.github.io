- Post Title: Magicka fonts in .XNB files - Many questions

Hey there guys!

There is this game called Magicka, and I'm translating it into my language. The problem is that whenever a Boss' name is displayed or the end of the level (be it defeat or victory), some text isn't displayed correctly (unicode characters, like é-á-ő-ű-ü-ö-ú-ó...etc.).

1. The files are in .XNB format, how can I extract/put the files back into them?
2. How can I create an .XNB format out of a font file?
3. I read that GXView can work, but it doesn't do anything on my PC, it just crashes (running WinXP SP3). Is there any other program out there to view XNB files?

I need help with this as soon as possible.

Thanks in advance!

I know that game is made with XNA Game Studio 3.1 on Framework 3,5 SP1 and (if im not wrong) Visual C# 2008 Express.
XNA Studio is saving TrueType fonts by SpriteFont to XNB files. I think is possible to edit them but im not programmer, and don't know even where and how to start

Well, one of my friend want to translate it.
How do you translating it, just the xml files?

By the way, a text tool would be nice.
