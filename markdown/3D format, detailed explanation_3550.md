This is a comprehensive explanation of nvidia's 3D model file format.
Uses a tutorial-like approach.

I haven't tried it out myself for lack of time, just found it quite interesting.
Of course that code is just an extract to get the main idea, everything else is missing like setting up OpenGL, creating the window and so on.
A good point to start with OpenGL is NeHe's tutorials: [http://nehe.gamedev.net/](http://nehe.gamedev.net/)
