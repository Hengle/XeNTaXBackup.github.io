- Post Title: Winx Club PC Game Unknown game model file format .smo

I have been playing this game for a while and I noticed that the Game files use very weird looking formats One of them is a File called .smo which I have so far found out that it is a game model file plus textures all in one but I cannot find a program to open it if somebody can help me find out how to modify it without changing the format and to reimport it in the game it would be a huge help. I will upload one model file from the game On Google Drive that you guys can get via this Post. Here is the link: [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1o_nLIj ... sp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1o_nLIjZ4UKtEQlTPAiT4cpfI4NHDg87V/view?usp=sharing)

Looks doable, but this is only one half of the mesh or so:

> and perhaps tell me how to convert it back to a smo.
Read here (click up arrow) and replace "fmlb" by "smo".

Well is there any chance you have a simpler tutorial. I am having a difficult time grasping the information that is given since I don't do this daily.

Nope. Sorry, I'm done with hex2obj and tutorials. You might view the links in my sig, though.

btw: handling 3D formats takes a long way to go. (Depending on your basics, of course.)

I don't think you can make it  

This is the maximum you can do:

I found a couple more couple of models on the Internet. 
because of this, many edits had to be made. (works with these models)

Inside in file  
if you look at the console you will see all the information.
e.g. for textures:

```
[2028603435, 183, 262208]
texture 3716
```

where: 
"5" -number SBOO
"dragon" -name SBOO
"2028603435" -type (texture)
"183" -offset
"262208" -size file
"texture" -myPrint "3716" -real offset (data_offset + file_offset)
texture its B8G8R8A8
but in general look inside the script everything is written there
