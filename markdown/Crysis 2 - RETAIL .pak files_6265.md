The retail game files are encrypted or using different compression.
In crysis 1/warhead they used simple zip compression.

Can somebody make a unpacker/packer?

Here are to small pak files from the retail game: [http://www.multiupload.com/UZ0K9RZM28](http://www.multiupload.com/UZ0K9RZM28)

Interesting, both have a ZIP end of central directory record, the remaining must be encrypted/XORed.

I expect the files to be similarly laid out like with the beta / mp demo but it would be useful to also have the retail version extractable, if needed here's the Bin32 (No 64-bit version in the retail build.) and Patch (From the 1.1 update.) folders from the game uploaded together, some of it might be redundant but perhaps it'll help, I assume as the above user mentioned that most have been packed into the now much larger Crysis2.exe file but there is some smaller .dll's that might be of interest though I wouldn't know since I'm not good at all with file format works or programming in general unfortunately but maybe it can be of use as I said.

you don't need to use the command-line.

create a link to quickbms.exe and call it reimport
the link must contain the following "Target File" arguments:

```
quickbms.exe -w -r
```
go in the folder where you have extracted the file, modify the files you want and DELETE all the others
make a backup copy of the pak archive you want to reinject back
double-click on the reimport link
do the exact things you did for the extraction
at the end of the process quickbms will show you how many files have been reimported, check if the number is correct

easy eh? :)

@DemonAk
the command-line you used doesn't work because you have specified the only the names of the file and so when the bat starts it will try to load the files with that name located in the current directory that is probably the user's one (the one of your windows account) and not the one from which you have launched the bat.
it's enough strange but seems the only reason, if you use full paths like c:\crysis2.bms c:\script.pak c:\test it should work (obviously the file must be located in the path you specify).

who uses the "quickbms -r -w"-only bat I said in the previous post will not have problems

@Herdell
I don't have the recompression algorithm of that game, only the decompression one so it's not supported

that's not possible because quickbms doesn't modify the size of the original archive, so you have not followed my step-by-step where I said that you must provide the original archive (obviously make a backup copy) so that quickbms can reinject the modified files inside it

AndylgRu, please, could you be so kind to explain us , STEP by STEP how did you do that? I really like to have English voices with Spanish subtitles, but I did extract both pak files and tried to replace the .xml english files with the .xml spanish files, but when I tried to do the repack, quickbms keeps failing saying :

Error: file "Languages/text_ui_messages.xml"
       the reimport option acts as a reimporter and so you cannot reinsert a
       file if it's bigger than the original otherwise it will overwrite the
       rest of the archive:
         new size: 1227821
         old size: 960284

- do you want to skip this file? (y/N)

(the above was an example) , if I select N the program ends, and if I say Y, it skips the changes.

As I did with the original Crysis 1, I tried to compress the Languages folder with WinRar using the STORE mode and rename it from .rar to .pak, but when I launch the game, after the first logo screen, the screen goes black and I can only hear the music 

Thank you in advance and to anyone that could provide us the solution to this (that includes you, aluigi, of course that I thank you for your wonderful program )

Size of XML files must be identical to the English version. To do this open with your files XML editor (Spanish version) and customize the size by removing lines from the column ORIGINAL ACTOR LINE (​​an English text). Only then can pack. Errors with the size will not by itself.

Have any ideas why Crytek did with the archives of this? Мarasmus. On consoles the standard archives.
Modding will die.
Need normal packer\unpaker.

You don't need repack files.

Extract gamecrysis2/localized/yourlanguage.pak, you will get a languages folder with the extracted files, then move this to the gamecrysis2 folder.
Extracted (and edited) files will override the pak files - I tested this method with the text / audio files and it's working.

I dont have experience editing xml files, I have no idea how to make the spanish XML files have the same size as the English ones. 

Did you guys edit all xml files? or just the one for the sp campaign (which file is it?)?

When you say "To do this open with your files XML editor (Spanish version) and customize the size by removing lines from the column ORIGINAL ACTOR LINE (​​an English text). Only then can pack. Errors with the size will not by itself.", which xml editor do you use?

Thanks in advanced.

Regards

I see... so...

I removed some "ORIGINAL ACTOR LINE" lines and then filled some characters with notepad to have the exact same size.

Once I did that for all xml files, do i need to put the "Languages" "under x:\Crysis 2\gamecrysis2\Localized\Languages\" ?

Thanks for your help.

EDIT: Got them working, had to copy the folder into x:\Crysis 2\gamecrysis2\Languages as mentioned. 

Thanks again.

a little note about the "quickbms -r -w" bat file:
you must NOT use a bat file, you MUST use a link to quickbms.exe containing that -r -w options and it will work perfectly

I will keep you updated about the profile\defaults\*.xml files encryption

indeed the error is not about the path, it means you have forgiven a needed parameter:
quickbms -r -w c:\crysis.bms c:\archive.pak c:\output_folder

the output_folder is obviously the input_folder in reinjecting mode.

anyway as written some posts before you don't need to reinject the files in the pak archives

Example 

You simply drag&drop the need files you want to import.

You drag all steps
1.quickbms.exe and add -r -w
2.then the crysis2.bms
3.then the decompressed files from what pak file you want.After you drag it onto the cmd, add .pak to its end (its the extension you want that folder to be compressed to)
4.Then you drag the Crysis 2 folder where the original pak file is located.
5.Press enter, and the original pak file will be overwritten with whatever you wanted to reimport back to the original pak.

Sorry my english. Hope it helped. Thanks again to author for this nice tool  im using it to add some music to main menu and custom skins to my scar and feline 

Damn it doesnt work anymore after updating to 1.2 ...game refuses to play music i inserted or start MP match with new weapon skins .

- Post Title: Re: Crysis 2 - RETAIL .pak files

-r -w are options so must be placed outside the " quotes and then you have added tons of paths... why?
the format is simply: quickbms.exe options script.bms archive folder

anyway the following is a translation from the italian of the step-by-step I gave to an user on my forum:

in the folder where you have extracted the files delete those that you have not modified, for example if you have modified the file my_folder\settings\settings.xml then delete all the others and leave only this one (don't touch its path)
create a backup copy of the pak file you will modify
create a link to quickbms.exe and add -r -w in the "Target:" field in the properties of the link, for example the result should be like: "c:\folder\quickbms.exe" -r -w
click on the link you have just created
quickbms will guide you step-by-step, so select the crysis2.bms file
select the original archive in which you want to reimport the files you have modified
select the folder where the files reside, exactly the same folder you selected for the extraction
at the end of the process quickbms will tell you how many files have been reimported, so verify that they are exactly those you expected
as you can see it's really a joke to use the reimport feature, indeed except for the link it's EXACTLY the same of the extraction

Aluigi Hello, could you try to fix a problem in this script crysis 2? I'm having problems when you rebuild a .pak. I leave the files with the same size but the bms says the file is 500bytes more, and this is not true, I am absolutely certain that they are equal.

Example, if I change a few lines, keeping the original size, he recreates normally, but if I change the whole file and also leaving the original size, it's this mistake.

Sorry for english I'm Brazilian.

here's the file .PAK entire original and the file I want to modify it.

the files are compressed and with some of them the compression used by Crysis is better than the one used by quickbms (zlib used in 7zip) while for others is better the one of quickbms.

but in this case I guess it's just the problem of the different chars used for the translation that occupy more space during the compression: english takes the chars under 0x7f while brazilian uses also accents and other chars making the compressed result bigger.

so for the compressed files it's important that both the real and compressed sizes are lower/equale than the originals.

Aluigi, I removed all accents and special characters in my language, and yet he's the error. Taking the characters, the file only 20bytes decreased, and the error is 500.

I find that very strange because the original file is 20,992 bytes, and quickbms says it has 20,553.

You got to be because of compression, for compressing them with winrar, the greater is translated, but are not accents.

Have you any idea what might be, and some means to help me?

Tks.

Hi!

your link gives a 404 error. But I think they blocked this hack with patch 1.4.

I'm trying really hard to increase the ammo of accessories (grenade launcher and gauss). Anyone figured it out? I tried EVERYTHING!!

ps: Thanks aluigi for your programm!

Guys, yeah.  The new crysis2.exe in the 1.4 patch uses patch1.pak as the main config pak, overriding all other paks.  For example, your custom controls in the gamedata.pak won't be picked up unless the files in patch1 are changed.

Hi!

I've written a keygen script in QuickBMS for Crysis 2 to get the working key for patch 1.4 and later. It uses brute force mechanism so it will take a lot of time to get the correct key. If you want to help all you need is to download QuickBMS from here [http://aluigi.org/papers.htm#quickbms](http://aluigi.org/papers.htm#quickbms) and the keygen script from here [http://dotyo.fw.hu/crysis2keygen.zip](http://dotyo.fw.hu/crysis2keygen.zip)

Increase the starting value of i15 or i14 variables in the script (i.e. For i15 = 202 < 256) and start it with the command

quickbms.exe -w crysis2dec.bms patch1.pak output

Do not modify the "256" values!

In case QuickBMS  won't start you can omit "patch1.pak output" and  specify them using the open window of QuickBMS which will appear. "output" can be anything, as far as I know. The -w option is needed to create a TEMPORARY_FILE if the correct key is found. In case you found it, please e-mail it to me. Thanks.

If you would like to know which keys are used in the decoding attempts, set debug_mode to 1 or 2.

If you would like to test if the decoding works at all, use it on english.pak.

Of course breaking the encoding of Crysis 2 is against the EULA so only those should start this script who doesn't have Crysis 2 installed and/or know how to break such License Agreements.

I've included a userDefineLang.xml for Notepad++.

Good luck! For all of us.

it's a waste of time that leads to nothing because you can't bruteforce a key of 16 bytes, except if you have some centuries of time to wait :)

to be short the problem is simply that is needed a nocd exe of patch 1.4 or 1.8 because "as far as I know" the 1.0/1.1 one don't have the key for these patches.

I have a 200 megabytes test version of the game so maybe I'm wrong because it's not the full game anyway that's what I guess.

oh cool 2 days ago the 1.8 nocd wasn't available.
maybe I'll give a look hoping my files are enough to reach the needed zone but it's not a problem because if it fails I'll give you the address where setting the breakpoint with ollydbg and retrieving the key.
stay tuned

bad news.
I have checked the executable and the key is fixed in the executable (50b6c0) and there are no other functions that call the xxtea encryption algorithm.

so this is not just another key but there is something else like an additional encryption.
in short I give up.

in short I give up.The cooky for "update 1.8" you can found for 10 days ago.   

You sad a few post´s earlier, that the ENCRYPTION is "xxtea encryption with fixed key".

I search at I-NET about this and foundhttp://www.shokhirev.com/nikolai/progra ... t_pas.htmlhttp://search.cpan.org/~andot/Crypt-XXTEA-1.00/XXTEA.pmhttp://www.tools4noobs.com/online_tools/xxtea_encrypt/, but i understand....nothing.....

May you can.

Download the Crysis 2 SDK, and you can unpack the 1.9 patch file. (Need x64 system!)

Bah, the problem is that within the patch, the xml is in a format different from the others, it is not possible to modify it with Excel or Notepad++.

Can anyone help? the file is attached.

I copied out the singleplayer texts (by hands). If that's enough, I can give it.

In fact, the new patch adds new information and texts on menus, because of DirectX11, and these texts are not in English.PAK, only this file that I put  there.

Can you find a way to edit it? Anything you can speak to the H3rdell, he is my partner, and can tell me if you learn how to do.

Thank you, hugs.

I just copied out the strings. I don't have tool, or anything. Just open the (compiled/binary) patch xml file to read, and you can see the texts.
I copied from the german file, and the strings goes like this: ID, English, German
I pasted these into the patch xml file from patch 1.2 (which is still real XML), and works fine.

Hello evin, well, I did what you said, copied the text strings and using a HEX-editor, and pasted the xml patch 1.2, and it worked perfectly, and could even translate some lines, but when I translate the rest, the game is not opened. Now, even I put the original xml (no change) of 1.9, the game does not open, but if I put the original patch1.pak, it runs normally.
Am I doing something wrong? But the strange thing is that I do the same procedure with the English.PAK, and the game works normally.
Could you pass the xml file that you created, so I can test here? I would be very grateful.

Hugs.

I just made a Mod by the ModTools. I'm not edited any pak files of the game.

And how did you do to put the xml as MOD in the game? I've tried several ways but could not.
I know I'm teasing, but I'm using layman in these things, kkkkkk.

Thank you for a while.

Crysis 2 Mod SDK Package v1.1: [http://www.crymod.com/dm_eds/download_detail.php?id=3](http://www.crymod.com/dm_eds/download_detail.php?id=3)
Create a MOD: [http://sdk.crymod.com/display/modsdk/Mod+Info+Creator](http://sdk.crymod.com/display/modsdk/Mod+Info+Creator)
And download my translation, and you can see, how it's works: [http://magyaritasok.hu/downloads/details/1414/crysis_2](http://magyaritasok.hu/downloads/details/1414/crysis_2)  ("Letöltés" - Download)

But you can't put the translation in official way into the pak files. But it should works, if you replace the xml files in the patch1.pak file, even the original xml are compiled xml, and yours are not.

Thank you mate, it worked all right, I already had the SDK, but was not able to make mods work, but looking at your translation, it was easy. Thanks again.

ps. I'll add on msn, I need to take some questions to you about another translation that you've helped me, but it is with some errors.

Hugs.

Is there something new about quickbms? In the 1.0 version of Crysis 2 which you could. Unpack pak files with Quickbms.
Now there are already displays the patch 1.9 and Quickbms because only at fault. I personally only way to get around the scripts.pak, because there are weapons all over the settings.
I've tried already with the mod tool to extract scripts.pak that everything went well, but when I was finished with the edit and all wanted to pack again, there was a warning message.
Well in any case has that does not work, because I have seen no change ingame.

How can we decompress the CRYePC2 XML files?

They are located in C:\Users\<username\Saved Games\Crysis2\profiles\<profile name\

I am specifically looking to open the attributes.xml file.

Crysis 2 SDK can create decrypted/encrypted PAK files.
