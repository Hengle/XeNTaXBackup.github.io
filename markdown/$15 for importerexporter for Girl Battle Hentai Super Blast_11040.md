Hi everyone. I'm sure you've heard of GBHSB. I'm willing to give $15 US for an importer+exporter. Yes, that's right, $15! And of course, this is just for me, no one else will ever see the script. This means you will perform personal engineering services for me at what will likely end up being an hourly rate which is very competitive with that of a fast food fry cook. Nevermind the fact that you would just release this script publicly for free if you actually felt compelled to write it. This competitive financial offer is surely enough to provoke you into doing something you don't care about for my own private benefit.

So, any takers? I'll give $30 if your script can also remove my false sense of self-importance and entitlement, but chances are you'll just make it worse by placating me.

Edit: THIS GAME IS NOW CRACKED WIDE OPEN

THIS SCRIPT WILL ALLOW YOU TO LOAD MODELS IN NOESIS FOR ALL RECENT HENTAI GAMES INCLUDING ALL GAMES BY ILLUSION
You need the latest version of Noesis to use this script.

Download this and put it in your Noesis plugins\python directory: http://www.richwhitehouse.com/pubdata/t ... decrypt.py
Once the script is installed, go to the "Tool" menu in Noesis and you'll see a new "Decryption Key Generator" option. Click on this, and while it's running Noesis can load all h-game models.

OK. Challenge accepted.
Use the bms script I have added to unpack the .F4CK archives. Keep in mind that those archives are 10Gb each... (1337 archives total)
Use the plugin for Noesis I have wrote to import the .fuckoff models with bones, textures and etc.

If those scripts works, I'm the author. If they don't then, I don't know who wrote them... Keep in mind that they can destroy your house, your personal life, your family and friends, your hometown, and the whole world...

Hey, thanks, I tried your script but it can't export, and it has errors on textures for main characters and the cockring accessory which is of particular importance to me. Can you please fix this?

That's odd... It works just fine for me... Are you sure you're using the latest build of Quickbms and Noesis? Also I forgot to mention that those scripts I made are for the PS 5 version of the game. Also make sure when you use the bms script to have at least 1337 Tb free on your hard dick. Otherwise not all the files will came out from the F4CK archives.

Please try it again with the condition I mentioned and tell me if they work for you. If you still have problems getting the models you desire from that game... I might just PM them to you.  (It just might take some time since they are huge)

But your script doesn't even have a model load script function so I know you are lying. Mods, this person is trying to scam my $15, can someone ban please?

I have no idea what you're talking about. My script works on 120%! Maybe you're doing something wrong... or maybe you're not using the right versions of the tools (I have proposed that in my other post), or maybe you're trying to extract the models from non PS5 version of the game (so far only the PS 5 version is supported, and I don't plan to support any other version).
Anyway, I'm not for the 15$. You like or not my scripts, it's okay for me. Just take them or leave them. 

PS. Can a moderator lock this topic maybe? (I've had quite a lot of fun...)

I was hoping this can be updated to repack the .F4CK archives... so that the naked mods will appear just as juicy in-game.

Actually I'm working on a repack script for the .F4CK archives. I would like to import back in the game full naked mods of the nasty ass old guys that hide behind the corner and in the closets on the maps... (Also I think to add them in few other places of the games, to be more noticeable while jerking off in front of the monitor for a maximum impact...)

Rimbros, you're brilliant. All I had to do was invert the transform matrix of reality and multiply it by the encrypted anime fetish matrix and I was able to use that to decode the script provided by napoleon321 into a complete GBHSB modding suite. I have access to all of the hidden nude models now, and I have seen the secrets of the universe. I know now that God exists, for God has whispered in my ear the secrets of reality and I hold the power and the glory of the kingdom of nude anime models.

blender  "Girl Battle Hentai Super Blast" importer (ver 0.3b) (don't forget to click the "thanks" button this motivates me a lot)

will import to blender any files with *.gbhsb extension. (at least it works for the DLC(the one with the Yeknom nudes   ))
can't figure the texture swizzling.
working on importing the animation right now.
this script is still an alpha, and needs testing

Girl Battle Hentai Super Blast sadly have been updated to version (0)(0) and none of you're h4cks w0rk dudez. I had implemented them all, up to my own mod W007 I write in Turbo Basic, yes? The (0)(0) update ruined my 1337 Tb game files backup, file replaced by scripts written in pr0n. So, has anybody get them uploaded again? I would have them pleaz. I am willing to pay $15,50. Also, I need to retake the models to be hero at other website.

I believe that the decryption key needs to be expanded to cover the increased sized of the areola in this version. If someone can crack the new anime fetish matrix it should be easy to disassemble and get the new ring size.

Problem is, looks like, that this is the ONE ring. I understand they uses fuzzy logic to hide the actual ring size. However, I was able to look into the pr0n scripts that the (0)(0) update installed over my game files, yes? It now seems to me some of the Super Blasts will cause an Overflow error in all of the Girl models if I try to inject them with W007 g4nst4 mode 3, you know that hot mod I created at [http://www.moddb.com/mods/Girl_Battle_H ... t_W007_4_4](http://www.moddb.com/mods/Girl_Battle_Hentai_Super_Blast_W007_4_4) . Due to popular demand, it seems that moddb pages is unreachable though. I am hero after all.

the last update isn't working for me. running the exe file directly from "C:\pr0n\strapon\gbhsb.exe" is crashing with a "ring zero error".

i installed the previous version but now the online feature isn't working anymore, when i ping the server i only get pr0n and no gameplay at all 
i think that's because my pc got banned on xbox live   

a screenshot for the error i get on the new version:

good work darko - The first, and the only rule of Girl Battle Hentai Super Blast  is: you do not ever talk about Girl Battle Hentai Super Blast!

the conspiracy behind this game is caused by snowden who encrypted in this game the documents he stole from the nsa(no such agency), and they used their bad aura to remove every bit of information about this game from the internet. while you progress through the game, you unlock new top secret documents that where hidden from the humanity, like yeti, ufo and cthulhu. but the game is too hardcore and no one can pass even the second level, so to get to the truth, we have to broke the encryption, extract the models, make them nude and then inject them back to the game, this way you get much more motivated to play and progress through the game...

I've had to stop my work on reverse engineering the new anime fetish matrix crypto because I have received several C&D's and death threats from anonymous sources. I've prayed for guidance, but the voice of God is silent, and I fear I have abused the power and wisdom given to me by unlocking the secrets of the H models and keeping them all to myself. I plan to give myself 80 lashings in penance to ring in the new year, in the hopes that God will speak to me again and deliver unto me the secrets of reality once more so that we can unlock the new Battle Girl Nipple Pinch Mighty O-Blast Missile model that was patched into the version (0)(0) update.

Good luck in the new year my friends, and may God have mercy on our tattered souls.

Be all that as it may, I'm still getting an Overflow when I inject the Girls with my own Penetrat0r (original). Perhaps that's just me, though. I can't be sure. I will inject some more.

you should check if you actually are using the right model's files to inject in. have you tried to switch the endiannes for the girls?
you can try to arrange the models by size and pick the biggest one for injection(there always are a few nonjailbait models like teachers or milfs in this sort of games), and if you still receive the same error then maybe the problem is in your tool  -  have you used your Penetrat0r tool only on gbhsb models? try to use it for injection in doa5 girls, and see if they will still be able to move(walk and fight) correctly after this?

Demonsangel, you devil. Thanks for releasing that. You do know that it the first script for the Tutorial level 1 in the game, right? That was also in the demo when the game was not yet released, and they hadn't put this whole encryption mess in there. However, they did change something though:

```
    if Age >= 50: Viagra = True
    
    while not Orgasm:
        noesus.usePenetrat0r()
    
    print("ejaculation_face.png")

```


which was in the demo: 

```
    if Age >= 70: Viagra = True
    
    while not Orgasm:
        noesus.usePenetrat0r()
    
    BuyFullGameNagScreenYouFucker()

```


This led me to look for this particular image. Using Strobe's forbidden tool called JaederNaub (used to come also with MultiEx Commander, until each and every self-proclaimed anti-virus website started to make our honest site look bad, because of this malware called MultiEx), I was able to get a fix on the location of this file (I think) in my 3 Tb backup files.

Disobeying our own rules and not posting a new topic in the Graphics forum, I ask for your help. I can't seem to get the colors right.



ejaculation_face.png (48.71 KiB) Viewed 72 times



I do think I am on a lead here though, as I was able to decrypt several filenames and look for their signatures with Demystifier Pro. 

Check these:



ghbsb_endscene_anim_10283.bmp (43.24 KiB) Viewed 72 times


Could the colors be worse?



gbhsb_model_startup_0.bmp (303.55 KiB) Viewed 72 times


This one seems not to be fully aligned as well, apart from the colors screwed up. 

I attach these examples, along with some files that could point to the color tables. Haven't been able to make sense of it.

Thank you, Mr.Mouse, for bringing this thread to the attention of all of our members here at Xentax and not backing down in the face of numerous litigation attempts. I hope, with all of the community support behind us, that secret religious cults and government organizations will think twice before trying to halt our noble efforts in reverse engineering the heavily encrypted formats of GBHSB.

I'm very impressed by your efforts in extracting this pixel data. It seems you have managed to figure out part of the proper anime fetish crypto matrix, but the CLUT looks like it isn't being decoded with the correct section of the CLUTORIS. (the bitwise or table used for color lookup tables inside of the isolation segment) The correct index to use for each image inside of the CLUTORIS seems to be related to the sector of the pixel data in the archive as well as the GUIDRIP (globally unique identifier from the redacted IP masking table) of the filename. You have to get the hash for the filename using the proprietary hashing algorithm located at offset 0x8197175 of the partially decrypted executable.

Darkstar, please take the time to review the thread before posting such negative comments. We are already in danger from several unnamed organizations because of our valiant attempts at decoding these formats. We need our community to support us on this. I think I speak for everyone in the United States of America when I say, GBHSB is our top priority.

You know, your user name makes it even more unbelieveable. And the fact that you seem to think that everyone here must  be American, because the world obviously only revolves around you...

I tried to, actually. But then some admin thought it would be funny to remind me with an E-mail. I disabled admin emails now, and I'll see if I can somehow put this topic on an ignore list or something, but having to disable admin emails is less-than-ideal but it seems to be the only way for now...

I'm not sure which admin decided to notify our users of this cause by e-mail, but I support their actions and I'm sad to see so many do not.

Because user satisfaction is very important to me personally, I'm willing to refund the time spent clicking the e-mail link by offering my extreme empathy toward those users that have suffered. I also offer a voucher to each user for a deep tissue massage of the finger used for clicking the mouse to visit the link, in hopes that the massive tissue damage incurred in the clicking of the link might be at least somewhat repaired. And finally, for your 15 seconds lost (but not the additional 60+ seconds you voluntarily spent posting here to complain), I can offer 15 seconds of my tears to mourn your unforgivable loss. Thank you for your understanding.

OK, I might live in the USA and do not agree everything my government may do or say but I am still Human. Do I not deserve some respect. Will I be forever banned because of the country that I was born to.
 What God do you speak of? Many Americans are Atheists. Would not these unholy Americans be more capable of the deeds you blame on people of religion?
 Therefore neither nationality nor religion has a hand in the problems you speak of. Apology accepted.

Let's not get into these topics of nationality and religion, that is just what the cultists want, to divert our attentions. I'd like to share an important discovery.

There is an important detail here that I hadn't yet discovered. At offset 0x7173455 there is a jump table which will give you address locations for each of the unique hashing algorithms. The code for the other hashing algorithms is encrypted and decrypted at the start of each jump location.

I have not yet been able to successfully reverse these functions due to the self-modifying code and self-modifying self-replicating kernel modules that are installed with GBHSB. However, I have managed to produce a hash key for one of the update models that produced these results. This is very promising indeed.

Rumours are going the next installment will go by the name of :

Off topic. But do I sense a coup? Have they already infiltrated our community ? Is their aim to remove me from my post? It certainly looks that way! We must be really on to something here. Perhaps they have already replaced Darkstar and Reinitialized with their own and their bodies are currently swimming with the fishes. The lack of humour on their part is suggestive to say the least.

thanks  Darkstar, you are the hero of the day, this thread was like pretty much dying, but after you came in, you pushed it forward like for 3 pages! and you shouldn't overact just for failing at decrypting  Demonsangel's  password for  noesis importer. here goes my tutorial: write the given numbers in the middle column in a hex editor, and the decrypted password should magically apear in the left column.


Heddly, isn't it obvious? it's america's official(capitalist) god - mammon, the old enemy of the communist/socialist god, thus it strikes once again(after the babel tower), this time with a new sauron's eye, meanted to destroy any community and society, and establish the power of money(today's democracy) instead. (not sure if frodo will be able to sneak in the heart of the mordor this time)


Mr.Mouse  do not try to offend them back, go the path of peace and flowers, it's the only way. [be like water my friend](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGFf3SRP1bE)


Demonsangel, your code is gorgeous. it's pythonic and self explanatory. but is it hentaic enough(you know all that rich/diverse culture with train molester and anime pillows)?, will it actually work on battle hentai girls(green/blue/violet hair)? i think it's too "western", try disabling all that plan_A code, with plan_B only it should work much faster. and you won't need to leave the computer working like a half of the night only to open like a single model. i would say this is a worth optimization, if your computer is powerful enough you'll even have time for a healthy sleep after parsing a bunch of models.
[spoiler][/spoiler]

[edit]
there is an error in my tutorial for Darkstar. the password will decrypt in the right column not in the left one. i somehow imagined this process from the hexeditor's perspective

I don't usually post on these forums (cuz I mostly use 'em to find answers to already asked questions), but when i do, it's because I recieve a message about a research that turns out to be a request to build IX script for a Hentain game, which doesn't exist.

Thanks for giving me a story to fake being drunk this New Year when i tell my friends about this.

You're right! It took forever on the tentacle models (without your adjustment) and because the time required rose exponentially I only tried it on vanilla models.

You two realise you're dissing 2 of the few people that made it possible for this site to still be going strong? There's a reason "there is none except XeNTaX".

I'm sorry you had to endure opening an email to distract you from all your viagra and pen1s enlargement offers. I received a total of 7 emails this year sent by a XeNTaX admin. Someone better call Hercules to clean up this mess in my inbox!
Yes I just got serious up in this bitch. Deal with it.

I've managed to mod in dicks for the nipples using model file renaming, but I can't make the turd model eject from there without figuring out coding stuff! $2.5k for whoever teaches me basic hex editor skills! not really.

Perhaps they have already replaced Darkstar and Reinitialized with their own and their bodies are currently swimming with the fishes. The lack of humour on their part is suggestive to say the least.
I feared this possibility so greatly that I dared not say it. But again, Mr.Mouse, your bravery in the face of this unknown abyss has given me strength to raise my head as well. I believe we have every reason to fear the worst has happened, that our very community is no longer a safe place for us, that they have designed plans to cut off our social lifelines by slowly replacing our well-humored, intelligent members with lifeless drones that do nothing but bemoan us and meet our every offering with demands for more. They aim to kill us from within, and for many months it seems their plan had been working.

Now that I know all of these ignorant, thankless fools are actually part of a global conspiracy, my resolve is stronger than ever.

Btw, if you don't even bother reading topics and jump to conclusions immediately, why did you even bother with the arrogant comments then?

Back to topic, I think I discovered part of the audio files. There's a sub-logical fluffy flexible line interpretation (SLFFLI) deep encryption method at work here ! I think with a little more effort I will come up with some audible files tomorrow. Stay tuned (pun intended!).

It would seem quite evident that work on Driver San Francisco is part of the liberal media's agenda. Nice try, "360AMC".

I'm glad to see someone making progress on the audio files. It makes sense that they would switch the encryption up for the audio streams. That's likely where the additional CPU is going on the async audio thread, I thought it was suspicious that it was using an entire core on my system. But I have not yet had a chance to break into the running code, they have additional kernel-level debugging traps surrounding that thread, and one risks exposure to the tentacle-based DRM built into their system modules when trying to circumvent it. I've seen several XP sandboxes sacrificed in trying already.

this thread has been compromised a little bit lately, by some claiming that the jokes are childish and not mature. since then there is a lot of flood and off-topic posts, many are not thinking anymore about reversing gbhsb and take the glorious prize of $15
imho you guys should take some antitroll precautions(i think i've read somewhere how wikipedia is handling this), let the thread chill down for like a few days, before continuing posting, so it will have it's time to ventilate the bad aura.

Success!! I was able to extract and de-de-de-decrypt the main theme of GBHSB using my SLFFLI-encoding routine using the hash named Bunny 18 that was tucked away in the root.bin. I think I also uncovered (Oo-er) the tune from Battle 16 in the Single-player campaign. I will update you later. For now, here's the main theme!

The bliss, I got my hands on Battle theme 16 as promised. Looks like some guy called Cyberdyne did that track, if I got the filename right. Sadly, my SLFFLI de-de-de-decryptor failed on other possible tracks. It's a start anyway. Looks like the enemy had more tools to keep us from finding the Truth. Battle theme 16 in itself points to the year 1992, when I read the hex code with the interpreter. Dark Messages hidden deep in the files, indeed!

PS. Just to taunt THEM, I posted my discovered Main Theme on Soundcloud. [https://soundcloud.com/mike-zuurman/gir ... uper-blast](https://soundcloud.com/mike-zuurman/girl-battle-hentai-super-blast)
That's should get someone's attention. We will not be detered.

PS2: Indeed, within seconds my post was liked at Soundcloud by some guy called Erik Connie, Electronic Music Producer from Copenhagen, Denmark., and minutes after that these two liked the song. I think they may know more of this game, I can feel it.

Hi there,

To the OP, I have a problem. While reading through the posts I followed everybody's suggestions but still cannot get it to work.

I asked for help over at tips.fbi.gov, but the people over there are quite rude,  so I though to ask here.

Upon extraction of the F4CK file I get an enlarged error (in hex for some F'cupped reason) but cannot seem to figure it out:

"554e41424c4520544f20554e4634434b204634434b2046494c45"

Can someone please assist in de-tangling my tanglednism?

true story. (noir as hell)

[the old days]
when i'm looking back, i can see now that everything started with "Girl Battle Hentai Super Blast" and my urge to get my hands on some 15 buks, this were supposed to be my One Last Job before retirement to peaceful honest life.

[the hidden truth]
i knew that if i reverse that boobs jiggle physics from the game, that could once and forever change the human knowledge on how the boobs jiggle, wikileaks reports that these physics were primarily developed by darpa for the u.s. army, but where too dangerous to use in real wars. the project was closed, but stolen later by north korea to be used in this game.

[the danger]
back then, the forum thread for gbhsb was sabotaged by some unknowns, rumor said that they were payed by the government, to discourage anyone who has the balls to make any kind of reversing on this game. i knew, that once i step on this road, there will be no way back, but i decided that the risks are worth, even if there are some hidden threats from the shadow governments that secretly rule the world.

[the inception]
spending a few nights in the dark, disparately trying to break the encryption i felt that something is fishy here. searching for answers, i infiltrated some secret conspiracy groups in the internets, and consulting their security experts, i found that what i need is a aluminium foil hat. i ordered two on amazon, but they warned me that commercial aluminium foil hats can't be trusted(viva la paranoia). i was suggested to use only AFH constructed by myself  ([instructions here](http://www.instructables.com/id/Aluminum-Foil-Hat/)). after wearing the anti-psychotronic defense device i felt the difference immediately. but the game's encryption where so good that, even with the hat, i couldn't do much.

[the revelation]
i realized that the clue is in the name of the game itself. of course: "Girl", "Battle", "Hentai" and "Super Blast", all of these are what a real man should achive in his life. the last one is the toughest one(coz it implies psychokinesis). after spending the rest of my life training the limits of my body and mind, all my chakras are finally open and the ether of the universe flawlessly flows through, it's like i almost found the answer to life / the universe / and everything. the time has come fellas, i know that i'm ready for that super blast thing...  now step aside, “I’M A’ CHARGIN’ MAH LAZER”:

O o

I know the last post was 2 years ago, but I have finally found a way to get all the models with 0% errors!!!!!!!!

- Unpacking .F4CK archives works often, but its very hard to view .fuckoff model files.
- 3D Ripper DX doesn't work, it says "ready to capture", but when I press F12 it tells me that I need to press F13 to rip from this game, and most keyboars are too shitty to have a F13 key.
- Ninja Ripper rips only the 3d text 

BUT I HAVE FOUND A WAY!!

You have to use a modded Ninja Ripper, called "Ninja Raper."
(Search for it with Bing, it won't work with Google)

I got all the HD* models w/ textures now!!

There's a plugin on the official Noesis plugins repo that allows you to import and export .fuckoff models as well as all Hard Dick models with boners and skinning/flaying intact. Ninja Raper only captures static geo and converted textures in video memory, so I don't recommend using it if you plan to use the HD models for anything worthwhile, like providing casts for your girlfriend when you're on business trips.

I'm still having an issue with some of the HD models, though. For instance, in the .fuckoff format, when it comes to the HD models, I noticed I should get some polygons more, as F4RSKIN=1 is in the script. However, in my modeler, as I load up S4CK1_1 (in the script referred to as S4CK T_T ) it seems it fails to render F4RSKIN on the HD model, no matter how I jank it.

I'm guessing the F4RSKIN was actually removed before the HD model was put to use in the game.

Yeah, the F4RSKIN data is composed of Bezier surface control points, with a custom Perlin noise function used to interpret the companion PUB32 binary which is referenced in the dynamic fur rendering pass. I don't know when I'll get to implementing that in the Noesis script, I need to implement a raycast pass for the model preview rendering first.

I've cracked the algorithm at the core of all Japanese hentai games.
THIS SCRIPT WILL ALLOW YOU TO LOAD MODELS IN NOESIS FOR ALL RECENT HENTAI GAMES INCLUDING ALL GAMES BY ILLUSION
You need the latest version of Noesis to use this script.

Download this and put it in your Noesis plugins\python directory: [http://www.richwhitehouse.com/pubdata/t ... decrypt.py](http://www.richwhitehouse.com/pubdata/tool_gkeydecrypt.py)
Once the script is installed, go to the "Tool" menu in Noesis and you'll see a new "Decryption Key Generator" option. Click on this, and while it's running Noesis can load all h-game models.

Mr.Adults your script is giving me the errors, plz help. I tried to use it on Witcher 3 files but its no work.

Also, what's the progress on Girl Battle Hentai Super Blast 2? I'm willing to pay $20 for a zbrush (.max) converter, but you have to hurry, I may change my mind.

All interested in this should be able to get to the models, so I took the liberty to upload this short YouTube tutorial on how to install the Python script! Share to all your friends, girlfriends and just about anyone you can imagine.

That was  the best mail ever. Could you just upload a torrent for this?. It would be awesome if you could port that to android.

Best plugin ever! So much work and sweat was put into this one. Two whole years of development! Respect to all who were involved into coding this stuff   This is absolutely crazy!

One problem though... Yeah, I guess it's not a complete development cycle without some small issues at first. All of my models are exported flipped on the Y axis and all the normals are reversed for some reason  I've exported the HQ white_bc_dong.fck without the LOD's and it turned out black from the normals and pointing downwards...

Looking forward for the next update

What is better than the SB3Utility tool ? I mean about Illusion games.
Is it only for the new Illusion engine, Unity ?

It works 100% with every Illusion game that ever has or ever will be made, the primary encryption key includes key data spanning the next 20 years leading up to the collapse of civilized society.

It is clear that this milestone has awakened a certain hater among our midst. After recieving the announcement email yesterday, he had some interesting replies for us.

See his other very constructive posts here: [search.php?author_id=34698&sr=posts](http://forum.xentax.com/search.php?author_id=34698&sr=posts)

It is clear that SomeDude / 360AMC / [futuramakicksass71@gmail.com](mailto:futuramakicksass71@gmail.com) thinks we have wasted our time on such an unimportant project, when we should have paid more attention to "everything me and racefreak posted on there". That would be "racefreak and I", 360AMC. Also, his name is RacingFreak, not racefreak. Furthermore, you two should not be mentioned in the same sentence, since RacingFreak has alwas been very nice in his posts, thanks people for their help, tests their stuff and never whines.

And now you should finally understand why all our energy went into GBHSB, and not some generic car game. Get your priorities straight!

It's unbelievable how someone can just callously take a shit all over 2 years of incredibly difficult, and ultimately very impressive work. If ever there were a sign of high-functioning autism or Asperger's, it's certainly in such a telling lack of consideration for our community and the dozens of people in this thread that have worked to make all of this possible.

Perhaps his project would have received greater consideration and attention if his efforts weren't sadly bound by his disability. Only the best of the best of us were able to successfully contribute to GBHSB, unfortunately.

Little late to the party, but I noticed the email.
Quite surprising, to say the least.
I read the whole thread.  This was the greatest read on a forum I've had in a while.

I observed something disturbing, nay, sinister. Behold my google search for this widely popular game.

It only shows those working on cracking the game, and a few hundred thousands that took some of our products. Surely, this implicates Google as being puppets of Illusion?

Holy pieces of shit! 

I noticed a user named Maiz reported MrAdults'  post of the excellent Python script for Noesis to the mods at XeNTaX as a violation. 

His comment: "Too Kawaii-desune~" 

What? Comparing this gargantuan accomplishment to something being as cute as this? [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlwObQAvXgY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlwObQAvXgY) ?

how dare they complain about this magical thread of great importance.

The new version "Girl Battle Hentai Super Blast DD Rack Fuel Injected Turbo Edition Hyper Deluxe Ultramax X part II Chapter 1" has been announced. 
many rumors have spread about the company replacing .fck model compression with .clt from the COQ modeling program. also the audio compression will be handled by the "Big O" audio toolkit and saved in .gasm format. although they are going the traditional route on background music and using midis much like every other pre 2000 japanese eroge game. supposedly the game will have realisitic breast physics that have been rebuilt from the ground up using the PNS scripting language and has support for oculus rift to give one the feeling of actually getting blown back like a mac 10. 

how shall we go about handling this?

Wait what ? Are you serious dude? You were coming in here looking all like the the lowlife scum we call spamwh0res, and only now I realize you were secretly referring to the Coque Chargeur 704 game artifact known to those able to get their hands deep into the Wizard's Sleeve. This secret location in Level 097 can only be accessed when first decrypting some of the ForkSource (tm). If you don't you will not get this card in the game:
