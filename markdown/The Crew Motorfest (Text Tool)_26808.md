Hello, I have the files for the closed beta of The Crew Motorfest, I think these are the language files.
Can you please make a tool to open these files?

The private Insider Program files of the game are encrypted, i doubt anyone at all will break the encryption of these builds.

I think the file structure will be the same in the full version. I believe that talented friends here will solve this file.

Not possible, encrypted. Devs made sure to not be easily tampered with.
Even now, the Closed Beta files are kept encrypted, compared to in the past when they where not.
Looks like Retail will be the same, who knows.

The file formats of past games were ''.fat'' and '.'dat''. The format of this year's game is ''.bfd'' and .toc format.
So I think the files can be opened because it has a different format.
Also the language files seem to be in a separate archive. I hope someone can solve it.

Do not quote the whole thing, you can easily edit the message.

As i said, they are ALL encrypted, the extension is irrelevant here, regardless, unless you know how to debug at runtime to break encryption AFTER you disabled/removed the BattlEye anti-cheat protection, there is no way to get to the assets inside the game archives. On top of that, the game executable is protected too, which complicates things even more.

You are right in your thoughts, but I want to be hopeful, I hope they will find a way.

Made an unpacker.

No keys provided for the time being, so use it as a reference for the time being, but do note that it uses the same annoying hashing.

Thank you very much for the vehicle. Is it possible to make a compiled exe?
Because I don't know how to use it. And will there be repackaging?
Because that's what we need to localize this game. We would be very happy if you do.

Thank you for the Unpacker, even if still in current unusable state for us end users, a small request if possible, can you please share a full list of ALL of the HASH's from the builds you got to test, I'd like to check their names if work.

PS. Ekey, as Nenkai said, your help is indeed invaluable, also i might add your skills are amazing as usual, thank you .

We want to translate this game, is there any development?
