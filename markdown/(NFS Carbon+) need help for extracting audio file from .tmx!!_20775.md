- Post Title: (NFS Carbon+) need help for extracting audio file from .tmx!!

i people,
All is in the title. As I said, I really would like to extract audio file from .tmx files, that contain engine sounds. there files are used In NFS Undercover, ProStreet, and Carbon. Only, no tools exist to do this.
I know that .tmx is a updated version of .abk and .gin, and the structure codec is pretty similar to .gin ^^

Any help is welcome !

PS : thanks to id-daemon to make a tool for extracting audio from .abk files, from NFS Undercover ! 

I uploaded somes samples, if needed at [https://drive.google.com/open?id=19U3l2](https://drive.google.com/open?id=19U3l2) ... epqdPzwnFP
Thanks in advance !

Carbon does NOT have TMX, only games that DO have TMX, which by the way are all GIN sounds inside the TMX container, are:

NFS Pro Street
NFS Undercover
NFS World Online
NFS The Run

And there is a proper, literally proper audio playback/conversion of almost all audio/soundsFX and what not with foobar2000/vgmstream from NFS series games.

have fun
