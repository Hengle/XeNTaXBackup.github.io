- Post Title: Yu-Gi-Oh! Tag Force Model Help

I need models of Yu-Gi-Oh! GX characters from the Yu-Gi-Oh! GX Tag Force PSP games (Or the Beginning of Destiny game on the PS2). Specifically, I need the models Jaden/Judai Yuki and Black Coat Chazz/Manjoume (though other models would also be helpful). I want to rig them and use them for a scene in a video I plan to make. I've looked all over but I haven't been able to find anything.

Does anybody know where I can find them/has them/can rip them for me? It would be very much appreciated.
