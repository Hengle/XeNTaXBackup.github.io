The Last of Us 2 tool. Currently it can get all models with skeletons & textures.
Video with example model: [https://youtu.be/Wr34rhWa3v8](https://youtu.be/Wr34rhWa3v8)

There are 2 special switches for skeleton export:
/r - reparent helper bones. Helper bones are originally parented to other helper bones, and the whole helper set is then driven by famous naughty dog physics system. This option reparents them based on bone names, so this is incorrect way and thus not supported option. I dont guarantee that it will work any good so use this on your own risk.
/rs - only extract skeletons, and skip all other assets in PAK file, which is useful for skeleton preparing before anim conversion. Its called "rs" because it scans for skeletons, but also reparents helpers.



Tool also supports all animations except chunked and additive. Example videos here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwPrcn-9i_Q](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwPrcn-9i_Q) [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZ3KrzEiyNM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZ3KrzEiyNM) [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6K1ax8pobEw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6K1ax8pobEw)

Models use a lot of physics, but still look good with just base skeleton:


Textures:


Lots of facial/hair bones:


Face closeup:


Topology:


Main skeleton:


Ellie 14 vs 16 skeleton:


Up to 12 weights and even more in complex areas:

Can't wait to see 3 or 4 pages of people asking for game files as always. Reminder that sharing copyrighted content sets yourself up for legal action so don't blame people for not distributing to total strangers with only a few posts.

Anyways awesome job Daemon, thank you !

Tool posted. General usage is the same as my previous uncharted 4 tool: [viewtopic.php?f=16&t=17303](https://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=17303)

I will try to compile a new usage help as soon as possible.

For animations, you also just have to drop animation PAK file onto the tool.

Just so everyone knows, getting files for this game is going to be hard to come by.

You cannot currently dump the game from a modded PS4 and seeing as OP has been working on this for over a month (YouTube) probably has a private dump of the game files

Isn't it possible to dump it from 7.02 firmware? (7.02 already has a public kernel exploit) I don't own a PS4 or ever owned one, so I'm not an expert but I read that it is possible, only the executable will remain encrypted. (hence the reason it's not uploaded anywhere. it's not playable on homebrew)  I don't know though, just speculation. EDIT: yep the 7.02 kernel exploit CAN dump games. [source](https://hackerone.com/reports/826026)
Anyway, see you guys in at least 6 months when the game dump will finally be made public.

Yeah, I feel like they don't even know what to do with them. They just need it for no reason.

I haven't personally asked for the game files but if I had them I could make more stuff like this, not everyone keeps them catching dust on their hard drives

I told you by MP they can't, why did you still ask if it's possible ? Still, I wonder who is that Brenda that have the files... or if anybody can. ( You never see what I do with models because I never post anything online for years. )

Guess it's gonna be a while before the files become properly public but for the few that have been shared, they are amazing quality. Thanks id daemon.

Thanks for Your work daemon_1! Most impressive.

A beginners question though, how do you access .pak files needed for the tool? I have a PS4 with Last of Us installed but I have a feeling this can't be done without completely dissecting it?

Models use a lot of physics, but still look good with just base skeleton:


Textures:


Lots of facial/hair bones:


Face closeup:


Topology:


Main skeleton:


Ellie 14 vs 16 skeleton:


Up to 12 weights and even more in complex areas:

How to fix the skeleton ?

Daemon, would you mind sharing how the skeleton/animations are in this game? What are you left with when you drop the animation PAK file onto the tool? 

Is the output similar to Detroit Become Human? 

I usually try to retarget the anims onto a seperare charater of mine. Usually if they are in SMD, I can do this pretty well.

Awesome! Thank you. Is it the usual step of merging the skeleton smd data with the animation smd data?

Looking forward to trying when the files are more widely availble

there's one full skeleton for whole mesh, and animation can affect all parts, or just some part, like palms.
But you dont have to merge anything.

It's obviously completely forbidden. You can sell tools you make if you want but in no way you should sell copyrighted assets.

It looks like the guy removed the TLOU2 models from Patreon

I guess I pissed them off.  My bad.  I was just wondering.  I've never had a problem with donating or subscribing to someone's Patreon, but at $15 or w/e it was a pop that was a bit excessive.  They probably would have gotten more help by being honest about their situation, releasing the models, and asking for donations to help.

The only guy deserving a donation here is Daemon for working during several days on the game. The other guy did nothing and just used it to sell copyrighted assets, which is completely illegal. You shouldn't give him anything.

this is a crime, i want those models to make a free mod pack, and i can't because guys like him!

Well, share this publicly. Don't you get paid here?

Does anyone else have issues with textures missing when extracting? 

ex: "owen-torso-color.tga" is completely missing from the files, though the rest of the files are there for him. 

Also "world-watchtower-dict.pak" will not extract at all 

anyone have any idea why?

Hard to tell?
There's a generated text file for each model which tells exactly which textures are used for each part and how.

Hey daemon, any chance for supporting levels/maps as a whole, just like in the Uncharted 4 tool?  For now your tool can only extract level/map  (static)objects individually.

the models come with the full set of bones and facial bones. there shouldn't be any issue rigging it with basic IK. ofc you may have to change the hierarchy to make sure you only IK the main bones. the facial rig is an entirely different beast, i guess. you may have to re-rig the face to use a limited set of control or you have to use the full set and eventually create "groups" of controls or use mocap data to feed the rig enough data for the load of facial bones. yep

All animations in the game already contain fully recorded IK tracks for legs and arms at least.

I second this, I see a folder with SMD animation but unfortunately due to my unfamiliarity with SMD's.
I haven't been able to use the animations. I can't view them in the timeline, I don't know how to see them in motion.
Any help would be great thanks.

I got them working in Unreal Engine, it supports retargeting: 
1, fixing the main skeleton mesh you want to use it for. For example I extract Ellie in parts with full skeleton: I have to assemble every part and then reparent some bones. (A lot, depends on the outfit) > import the sekeltal mesh into UE. (The retargeting happens by bone name so make sure you don't mess them up)
2, Extract the animation you want to FBX with Noesis
3, Import the animation into UE, paying attention to the skeleton setting when you import: you need to select the the skeleton of the mesh you imported earlier, this is an important step: this is when the retargeting happens.
4, Done! If you successfully reparented and fixed the main skeleton, it should work. (All the helper bones need to be parented to their own non-helper ones: spine_a, then spine_a_helper.)
[https://i.imgur.com/zp6ZjPm.png](https://i.imgur.com/zp6ZjPm.png)

Daemon, wouldn't it be possible to extract bones as they should be? I mean without reparenting every time? What's causing this issue?

Also, has anyone extracted bnk files from tlou2? I could easily extract the xvag ones to wav, but not bnk.

Bones are extracted as they are in game files.
Helper bones are originally parented to other helper bones, and the whole helper set is then driven by famous naughty dog physics system.

There is an option in the tool to reparent them based on bone names, but this is incorrect way and thus not supported option. I dont guarantee that it will work any good so use this on your own risk. To do this, run the tool with skel PAK file with "/r" switch. For example, "tlou2 /r ellie-skel.pak"

To  kotn3l, you are doing some fine work. I can't believe you pulled it into UE4. 
I have been trying to re-rig using Blender but the results are awful at best due to auto weight painting issues.
I know its a long shot but if you ever do a step by step tutorial, I will happily watch, read or listen. Thanks

Also thanks daemon1, you guys are wizards.

Yeah, it took me a while to figure out everything.
Basically what I did is copy all the same parts that use the same skeleton into 1 SMD file.
For instance I chose ellie-head.smd, then copy the rest of her body (pants/boots, arms, bracelet) in there. Only copy starting from triangles, and make sure there is an "end" at the end of each mesh you copied.
NOTE: for example the seattle day 2 jacket takes the jacket skeletons, and not ellie skeleton. Make sure you don't copy files like these. (You can guess if you check the file and compare it to Ellie skeleton. Like a jacket could be referencing bone 123 which for example would be Ellie eyelash bone. Then you know for sure that it won't be using Ellie skeleton, but another one.) Same goes for her hair (? Some of her hair..., maybe only the strand hair), backpack, basically everything that uses physics in-game.

Import this into Blender, also select the correct Up axis, so Ellie is imported in correctly. (not facing downwards or etc) Then reparent each helper bone. If you did this correctly, you can move EVERY bone (fingers, even face bones) in her body without it getting messed up. !!!This is important!!!

Import other accessories (backpack): Reparent those bones into main Ellie skeleton: reparent its root to Ellie's root, then go by the bone names again, just like the helper bones. This is important again if you want them to work correctly. If you can't find any correct bone name to parent it into, just try seeing where the bone is weighted to the mesh and try to guess.

To other objects that rely only on physics (strand hair, jacket, etc): Reparent those bones into main Ellie skeleton: reparent its root to Ellie's root, but then, you have to check each simulation bone and group them where they're modifying the mesh. For instance if 20 simulation bones move the right arm of the jacket, parent them into Ellie R shoulder. Unfortunately there is no other way, but to check bones 1 by 1. Thankfully, they're groupped together so they're not in random order, so there's that. [https://i.imgur.com/7CvRurl.png](https://i.imgur.com/7CvRurl.png)

Then if you got everything, export this into FBX, then open in UE.

Alright kotn3l, I'll give it a go later after I try the auto rigging method first because I had some decent results around the face.

My goal is to export the FBX to UE4 for full VR motion tracking. Thanks again and I hope I can come to you for more advice if necessary.

Btw are you using both Blender and Cinema4D?

I don't like Blender, I only used it to convert the SMD to FBX. Although I had some problems with it, but reexporting it into UE the mesh problems disappeared. (I use C4D for reparenting the bones cause it's just drag and drop.)

Tool updated. 

With this new version you can now fully export world-watchtower-dict.pak which has 6 textures with very long names. To do this, be sure to export in the root of the drive or a very short folder name (like "C:\T2")

Note that there are 2 special switches for skeleton export:
/r - reparent helper bones. Helper bones are originally parented to other helper bones, and the whole helper set is then driven by famous naughty dog physics system. This option reparents them based on bone names, so this is incorrect way and thus not supported option. I dont guarantee that it will work any good so use this on your own risk.
/rs - only extract skeletons, and skip all other assets in PAK file, which is useful for skeleton preparing before anim conversion. Its called "rs" because it scans for skeletons, but also reparents helpers.

Examples:
tlou2 some-skel.pak /r
tlou2 some-skel.pak /rs

/rs - only extract skeletons, and skip all other assets in PAK file, which is useful for skeleton preparing before anim conversion. Its called "rs" because it scans for skeletons, but also reparents helpers.

Examples:
tlou2 some-skel.pak /r
tlou2 some-skel.pak /rs

Thank you!

I have a problem using the /r thing with skeletons. Pics below. I have two ideas what could be causing this:
1, Most models are in different paks, like the meshes and the skeleton. Now, if I extract the skeleton with the /r, and paste it into the mesh and open it, some weights are referencing completely different bones. Could this be an issue? (I extracted the mesh with the /r switch as well)
2, The bones look like if they've all been moved to 0,0 and not moving the mesh as they should.

otherwise the reparenting would be flawless, I hope this can be fixed!

The pelvis bone should be rotating it from the pelvis, and not from her feet.  (all bones are in the same positzion. no matter which one i select, the weights are okay though, bone positions nope, looks like they are all in the root position)

There's nothing to fix, everything is working fine. Both your ideas are wrong.

So if I use the /r switch, the bones are reparented as they should be, but they will all be moved to the root location. See pics in above post. For example I rotated the pelvis bone, and it got rotated from her feet, and not from the pelvis itself, or even looks like not all the feet bones have been rotated with the pelvis. Without the /r switch the bones are working as they should (except the helper ones obviously)

What I did is: extract the skeleton and model with the /r switch. Copy the skeleton.smd into let's say a corresponding body model. (The nodes) Now if you open the smd file in blender and try rotating the pelvis, or any other bone, it is wrong. See pics in above post again.

Hope it makes more sense.

(If I manually reparent the helper bones this issue is not present.)

When I do the same, everything is correct, and all bones are in correct places.
I did that with many different characters, and they ALL work fine.

Interesting, maybe I'm doing something wrong.

Yes its a different model. I'm using the right skeleton though. (marlene-body.pak, marlene-skel.pak, please check it if you can, maybe that one model is wrong?) (in abby-flashback-dad)

I find it kind of funny how some people keep the models private. You don't own the game, you don't own the character or the IP and you certainly do not own the model. So why keep it private? You want a big di** recognition that you can reverse engineer a game and put together bones in Blender is that it?   

I think people would appreciate you a lot more if you actually shared. Just my 2 cents.

(This is not for this thread in particular but in general)

Not sure what are you talking about but you are wrong in every aspect of your message, most of us in here that where interested in any of the games being reversed in this forum got the files in question regardless of the reverser in any of the threads, reversers get the files from users 99% of the time, it has NEVER been reversers job to distribute any of the files, who ever has them has the choice of sharing or not, its their call, due to mostly DMCA notices its shared among trusted people/friends/groups etc, its how it has always been since the beginning.
And after all, not all of us are interested in every single game has ever been reversed, i get PMed at times for weird requests and i do NOT even have the files they ask for, but i sure do give thumbs up on a lot of threads due to the hard work and dedication involved as this is no easy task, my 2 cents.

At the end of the day, NO ONE owes anyone anything at all, be it reversing/sharing/hacking, all of this is done voluntarily, pure fun, hobby, etc.

DMCA notices on sharing models online? No, I don't think so. Unless the person was making profit out of that model, they wouldn't get a DMCA notice over it.

You think I don't know that? But most of these reversing/sharing/hacking are just: "Hehehe, look at what I have and what you don't have. Hehehe. Beg for it, loser."

I second this, I see a folder with SMD animation but unfortunately due to my unfamiliarity with SMD's.
I haven't been able to use the animations. I can't view them in the timeline, I don't know how to see them in motion.
Any help would be great thanks.


I got them working in Unreal Engine, it supports retargeting: 
1, fixing the main skeleton mesh you want to use it for. For example I extract Ellie in parts with full skeleton: I have to assemble every part and then reparent some bones. (A lot, depends on the outfit) > import the sekeltal mesh into UE. (The retargeting happens by bone name so make sure you don't mess them up)
2, Extract the animation you want to FBX with Noesis
3, Import the animation into UE, paying attention to the skeleton setting when you import: you need to select the the skeleton of the mesh you imported earlier, this is an important step: this is when the retargeting happens.
4, Done! If you successfully reparented and fixed the main skeleton, it should work. (All the helper bones need to be parented to their own non-helper ones: spine_a, then spine_a_helper.)
https://i.imgur.com/zp6ZjPm.png

Daemon, wouldn't it be possible to extract bones as they should be? I mean without reparenting every time? What's causing this issue?

Also, has anyone extracted bnk files from tlou2? I could easily extract the xvag ones to wav, but not bnk.

Were you able to get the animations working on Unreal Engine's character rigs? For example could you retarget it to the meta human character?

Its been a long time, I would hope the files were more accessible. would love to get a hold of the animations, sounds and alot of the environment models. Still working on my Detroit become human project. I think I helped some of people in the Detroit forum. Would like the favor returned.

Hi, I'm wondering if anyone can help me get some textures from the game, I'm after the polaroids of abby and the gang. I normally mod Resident Evil games  but I am after the polaroids for a project I'm working on 

Many thanks

Maybe not all pak can fully extract for example world-watchtower-dict.pak. msg say "Texture pah+name too long. Truncated", so this broke up.

this is not the problem of a tool. There's a limit for path length in windows. Use shorter paths.
but All files will be extracted in any case.

Looking for help with UVs

When I extract the pak file I get ASCIIs and SMDs.  Blender gives me an error when I try and open the ASCIIs but will open the SMDs with 1 UV map, there are supposed to be 3.

I've tried opening in NOESIS and exporting the ASCIIs as FBX.  Doing that I get 2 UVs but I'm still missing the 3rd UV with the stitches information.

I just can't figure out what I'm doing wrong.  Any help would be appreciated.

When I extract the pak file I get ASCIIs and SMDs.  Blender gives me an error when I try and open the ASCIIs but will open the SMDs with 1 UV map, there are supposed to be 3.

I've tried opening in NOESIS and exporting the ASCIIs as FBX.  Doing that I get 2 UVs but I'm still missing the 3rd UV with the stitches information.

I just can't figure out what I'm doing wrong.  Any help would be appreciated.
you can open ascii's in blender if you copy-paste the skeleton to the model
it was like that for a lot of my tools, and i mentioned that when referring to the fact that this tool usage is same as "uncharted" tool
or you can find a better noesis plugin that reads more than 3 UVs

Thanks for the reply.  Okay, I had read something in that Uncharted thread about copying and pasting the skeleton in the SMD file, which worked but didn't give me the UV's.  I'll try more carefully with the ASCII.  Thank you.

By reversing the actual game binary data, because if the ASCII would have had those coordinates once you import the assets, they would have been positioned accordingly up on import in Blender, so if your a skilled reverser then that's where you need to start, not to ruin your enthusiasm, since you had to ask where to star, it would take you months to reach that level, if not more being a newbie.

Okay, i give it up, i am a total newbie in reverse engineering, maybe tlou2 is not the best game to begin with ,  is daemon1 the only one who can create a maptool?

Not sure if I'm doing something wrong, but I get this error whenever I try to use the tool 
Code: Select allUnhandled Exception: System.IndexOutOfRangeException: Index was outside the bounds of the array.
   at ?????????????????????????????????????????.?????????????????????????????????????????(String[] )

Has anyone else encountered this issue? What's the fix?

Woops, forgot to login to update this issue. Turns out, it's both because of Windows Defender and the character limit in Windows. 

Moving the folder to the root of my C: drive and adding exceptions to Windows Defender solved this issue.

The Last of Us 2 tool. Currently it can get all models with skeletons & textures.
Video with example model: https://youtu.be/Wr34rhWa3v8

There are 2 special switches for skeleton export:
/r - reparent helper bones. Helper bones are originally parented to other helper bones, and the whole helper set is then driven by famous naughty dog physics system. This option reparents them based on bone names, so this is incorrect way and thus not supported option. I dont guarantee that it will work any good so use this on your own risk.
/rs - only extract skeletons, and skip all other assets in PAK file, which is useful for skeleton preparing before anim conversion. Its called "rs" because it scans for skeletons, but also reparents helpers.



Tool also supports all animations except chunked and additive. Example videos here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwPrcn-9i_Q https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZ3KrzEiyNM https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6K1ax8pobEw

Can you please release a Map tool aswell?

I dont understand how skel and body would melt together in blender, if i open the skel *.smd file on a character  nothing really happen. If i open the skel smd file alone there´s a chaos of joints. How could i open them together like in your video? The other thing is, can i only extract ellie anims? if i try to extract the anims of the bloater or clicker, nothing happen...

first you should open skel.smd file with notepad ,and copy everything, and then open mesh (smd) with notepad and replace first 3 line with what you copyed and make sure there is no space between end and triangles.

If i try to extract the anim files, the Tool Show me :
Skeleton directory (skels) not found

What do i Wrong? How the anim pak files will find the skel file of the character and extract them?

first you need to unpack skel.pak and then you need to extract anim.pak and both pak files should be in same folder

for eg: if you want to extract anim-ellie-movement.pak you need to extract ellie-skel.pak first, then extract anim (make sure both skel and anim are in same folder).

Thanks for your answers, help me a lot. But one more question Please, which  part of the mesh  i have to chose for replacing the skel values in? For Example i try it with  joel-skel in Joel-Body but i cant see the skel of Bones in Blender,just the mesh there.

I think the models have no Material path, so you  have to put them manually to the models in Blender

The folder i got containing abbys FBX contains a ASCII folder, a SMD folder and also a folder with TGA files WITH 5 OTHER FOLDERS inside for all the textures and normals and stuff, theres like 50 texture files

You dont need not every file because you dont have the naughty dogs engine, i think you just need the texture file "color"
 (for examole "abby-arms-color")of the body parts and "trans" for hairs etc. The Rest of rendering settings you'll make with the Programm you rendering in.

If i import the smd animation to the character with the skel, just the skel is moving, the mesh is still freeze

I dont understand it too, it seems to me the heper Bones block the animation on the mesh.
"There are 2 special switches for skeleton export", what do you mean with that, where i can switch it?

All the helper bones needs to be a child of the corresponding bone. For example: R_thigh_helper should be a child of R_thigh etc. By launching the tool from a command line, you must give it the /r switch, so it will automatically reparent the helper bones when extracting. Or you can do it manually....thats what I did before.

Thanks for your answer, but i  do not understand the thing with the /r switch. What should i write in command line when for example the tlou2.exe is still on C:?

C:\>tlou2.exe /r  

??? if i am doing this, some msg will come about system.io.Error....

first make a new folder and name it whatever you want 
and inside that folder, place skel.pak file and last of us 2 tool 
and run command line then and instead of tlou2.exe /r  , type tlou2 ellie-skel.pak /r

and while importing animation you need to delete keyframes of helper bones

I think its because you reparented the helper bones. If you didnt, you dont need to delete the helper keyframes either.

yes, reparenting bones is not supported option and should only be used on your own risk.
Its stated in the first post.

So just a couple of things...

Could someone confirm this workflow please? (I only need working SMD skeleton animations, I do not need a skinned mesh to be connected)

1. Use Neosis to extract the psarc files from the Disc Images (we are all using D****X I assume and the PKG extraction code is all zeros?)
2. From these extracted folders and files find the Skel .paks and the Anim .paks
3. Use the tlou2.exe tool via cmd with   "tlou2.exe ellie-skel.pak /rs"   (to extract just the skeleton) (making sure any anim .paks are in the same folder)
4. Now drop the anim.pak (Should be related to the skeleton) onto the tlou2.exe to extract all the anims (lots of smd files)

Lastly, has anyone found any of the cutscene animations? This may not even be a thing as they sort of merge into them from gameplay and it may be a case that only certain "in-game" animations are available and the heirachy of the folders. Could anyone confirm this? 

I would love to be able to sync up cutscene animations but I don't know if they've been found yet.

Thanks and thank you for the tool.

At point 3. I use the tlou2 .exe Tool via cmd "tlou2 ellie-skel.pak /r"
and do it the same way with animation, thats the only way to parenting normal bones with helper bones together for best solution. I thing the Cutscene are behind the files who begin with "seq" for sequence, but never unpak it till yet

Okay, is there a simple other way to get the xyz coordinates of the Single objects to rebuilt the map manuelly, for example  some special Byte sequence in the hex or anything?

I think i have no choice when you will never do it, you can make it easier to me to Tell me how i can get the xyz coordinates

It is so much effort to a make a maptool for tlou2, like you do it for uncharted 4, or is nobody interested without me

I have tried unpacking the seq .paks with both /r and /rs skeletons and while it does look like these contain cutscene anims, when I load them into blender they are 1 keyframe each. So I'm not too sure. The paks themselves before extracting are like 2mb so it's not looking good  

They are locked in the animstream .stm files similar to TLOU 1. There is a tool for TLOU1 but it is a little buggy if I recall, and yep, I can't load anything into it unfortunately but that does make sense as it's a different game. Was it ever possible to import stm files?

That's a shame, what does chunked mean?

The guy who made the tool for TLOU 1 seemed to be able to import stm animations in his tool. You're the main man around these parts daemon, would it be possible, what stops it/makes it difficult? The ability to use Detroit Become Human cutscene animations was incredible. It would be a shame if we didn't get something to access them for TLOU2. By the way I am not out-right asking you to make such a tool, but of course it would be brilliant if you could.

look like these contain cutscene anims

cutscene anims are chunked. they are not supported

off the topic, is there any tool/way to extract anim files form uncharted 4 's pak files ?

it was all in my plans, along with tlou2 maps and animations, because its very similar, but unfortunately i'm having health problems for 3 months already, and i can't do anything of that yet.

Why dont you make your tool open source, so we can work together on maps and animation tool. get well man.

HI first post here, so ive extracted everything, sadly anything from the .pak68 archives cant be opened properly in blender as far as I know as noesis doesnt like the ASCII files it generates, also once inside the .pak you want the files arent named properly, theyre just called sea-arrival-river-vegetation_1 etc etc 


for example lets say you want to extract some lovely ferns from the seattle intro bit, you find the .pak you want inside the .pak68 folder and open the text file associated with it "sea-arrival-river-vegetation.txt" this file contains the contents of that .pak 

the contents of that file reads as follows:

level-id sea-arrival-river-vegetation
package sea-arrival-river-vegetation
package sea-arrival-river-vegetation-ingame
package sea-arrival-river-vegetation-phys
package sea-arrival-river-vegetation-dict
cache sea-arrival-river
cache sea-arrival-river-vegetation-trees
cache sea-arrival-river-vegetation-forest
cache sea-arrival-freeway-vegetation-trees
actor bush-shrub-a-sapling-a
actor bush-shrub-a-sapling-b
actor bush-shrub-a-sprig-a
actor bush-shrub-a-sprig-b
actor bush-shrub-a-sprig-c
actor plant-fern-bracken-b
actor plant-fern-bracken-crouch-a
actor plant-fern-bracken-prone-a
actor shrub-fern-a-2m-crouch-cover
actor shrub-fern-a-a
actor shrub-fern-a-a-sm
actor shrub-fern-a-b
actor shrub-fern-a-c

Each level contains its respected assets and the .txt tells you what assets are inside the level, but.... when you extract the respective .pak from the pak68 folder  so in this case youd go to \Image0\build\ps4\main\world-seattle-arrival_files\pak68\sea-arrival-river.pak and extract it via the tlou2.exe tool, it contains ASCII and smd but NONE OF THE ASCIIS ARE USABLE, they cannot be opened or previewed inside noesis even with the xps script, the SMD's contain only 1 UV map and most of the models have multiple sets for things like grunges and masks etc, the ASCIIS contain multiple UV maps and are thus needed over the smd files, 

Can anyone help? I'm having a nightmare here trying to get this work, so far the only workaround ive found is looking for the asset I want inside the actor97 folder for each respective level, search for the ACTUAL asset name, not what its called inside its subfolder. 

for example, if I want a fern, i open the .txt file for the level: "sea-arrival-river-vegetation.txt"  then look for the asset I want, in this case its: "actor plant-fern-bracken-crouch-a" make sure you search for your assets INSIDE the actor97 folders or they wont work. 

note: ASCII seems to extract and work *fine* even with multiple UV's if extracted from the actor97 folders, but for some reason, anything ASCII from the pak68 folders is broken with this tool. I've managed to get the sedan working and even set up its textures in blender if anyones interested. 






NOTE: notice how the model has multiple UV sets BECAUSE it was imported as ASCII and extracted from the actor97 folder. You cannot do this AS I KNOW OF with anything from the pak.68 folders.

hey man! I cant attach the file as sharing is prohibited here but I can point you to where it is! 
\Image0\build\ps4\main\world-saving-kids_files\pak68\ski-gallows.pak\ski-gallows_1\ski-gallows_16.ascii



Trying to import to blender: 


throws up error: 


the model is of the burnt out car from the Paris Trailer: The SMD loads fine but is missing the UV sets hence why we need the ASCII to work.


model is unusable without the multiple UV sets.

okay you found a model that is not supported by the tool
i can't fix it now
all you can do is somewhow find a text editor that will remove extra "1 0 0 0" lines from ascii files

so instead of:

0 0 0 0
1 0 0 0

it will be:

0 0 0 0

Yep, and if you follow his work, most likely Uncharted 4 workflow.

This is great news. I spent about a week trying to manually put together Ellie's room. I never completed it because some of the textures were a pain to find. Looking forward to your tool. Thanks for all of your efforts.

A couple of basic renders of my incomplete attempt.

TLOU2 maps tool for testing. Works same as Uncharted 4 maps tool if anyone used that before.

Usage: drop .PAK file with a map onto the tool, or run from command line

All textures will be auto-assigned to meshes. To make them work, you have to either convert textures to TGA, or do mass replace .TGA to .DDS/.PNG (whatever format you have them) in ASCII because they are text files

Notes:
- exports to ASCII, split into 100MB parts for better handling
- exports to OBJ, but only 1 UV pair
- will make ...._shaders.txt file (for reference) with full list of all shaders & their textures used
- only works with maps, so don't try running it on characters, it will crash

Are the auto-texturing support the map tool or the first? Will the name of the tga file change like the folders name?  I asked coz i found a tool that rename the tga file to the folders name thats in it, and when the tool do the same i can avoid unnecessary work

its for map tool.
Yes, name of textures will change, but not exactly like the folders name, because a few thousand of textures would have same name in this case.
The new tool will also have a few other differences, like placing diffuse/normal textures to their proper slots, because diffuse is not always the first in a list, same for normals.

New map tool:
- new texture output for auto-assigning
- ascii modified to have 2 first textures as diff, normal (for SecaProject blender plugin to load them)

note: some objects are white, because i didn't extract all 40GB of texture paks, just to test the new tool

with the new tool, how should we make auto-texturing to work? do we have to place all of the textures in one folder alongside with the mesh? just like laraascii? can you explain a bit?
Also can we get Uncharted 4 to work with this new tool that you placed? ( I mean blender py plugin)
i will explain in details once i have time
but quick answer is...
- if you use johnzero plugin, you need to place all of the textures in one folder
- if you use this new SecaProject plugin, they will load from folder structure

and yes, i plan to change Uncharted 4 tool

...should i rename the tga to dds in the mtl file for obj files?
Yup, even if you decide to convert to PNG the whole thing, you can edit it same way to make them load/work.

Tool looks great, if anyone knows where I can find a FPKG by any chance do shoot me a PM as I am clueless on how to open a PKG file other than the normal PS4PKG viewer. If this is something still really private then excuse me for this post and ignore me please!

EDIT: Figured it out, indeed, no need to ask - just google!

Googling something like "the last of us 2 fake pkg" gives you so many options, why everyone hates google, that's what is for, searching.

Anyone else getting all textures extracted as random names inside of a folder of what the texture should actually be called like BD5A1141AA112Z_dx10 for example? Was wondering how I can make the textures work with the .ascii files if the textures are named like that since it doesn't recognize them (renamed .tga to .dds obviously too).

Alternatively I'll probably try and look for a program that renames the files inside the folder as the folder's name, see if that will help.

Drop the texture dict file on the map tool - it will name the files.

Does anyone have a quick tip on locating a texture when a "Missing File" texture shows up?  This is in regard to maps.

if you dont want to export all textures, then make a text list of all textures ans search through it.

So, I think you're saying that if the texture hasn't been extracted then it'll get assigned the missing texture file?  I'll check again and make sure I've extracted everything.  Thanks!

No.
There's no such a thing as missing texture file.
This is not related to my tool or extracted textures. This must be your software, whatever you're using.

Hey Daemon1 i have a question. I need some Items from the Maps, so i used the first normal tlou2 tool to cut the map in singel ones, but theres no texture information when i export it in noesis in obj to open it in maya, just "m1". Can you change it, that it show the texture or directly exported in obj like in the tlou2_map?

the character + skel + anim are in the subfolders called "actor97" every "word-...." folder has this subfolder and you can find them there i think ellie is in common files or sp-common files cant remember. extract them in cmd for example "\>tlou2 ellie-skel.pak /r" then put the smd files in wordpad or editor together, if you extract the anim files, the skel have to be in same folder like the anim file you want to extract

and i can't find any anim in this file (common) .. do u mean "world-.." instead "word-.."
and what u mean by "the skel have to be in same folder like the anim file you want to extract" ?

sorry for inconvenience ..

make a new empty folder, copy ellie-skel in it and extract "\>tlou2 ellie-skel.pak /r", so you have the smd file called "ellie-skel_skel.ellie-skel" and a new subfolder with other files, ignore that subfolder first. Now you have the skel of ellie, if you open it i blender with smd plug in you can see it. Now you need the body parts for the skel. copy in your folder for example ellie-head and extract it. Now you open the "ellie-skel_skel.ellie-skel" in wordpad or in anay writing program. So you have to see:
version 1
nodes
0 "root" -1 .... etc

scroll it to the end. Now you open the ellie-head.smd file in wordpad too. copy the hole text and copy it to the end of the ellie skel file in wordpad. Than save it as "smd". If you now open it in blender you have to see Ellies skel with the head. This if you want the hole body you have to do it with all body parts copy it in one file together and save it as smd.

Now the animation:
copy for example any ellie animation for example "anim-ellie-mm-melee" and copy it in the first folder where you extract the skel drop it on the tool and a new subfolder will write with the animtion it it. So open your amd skel with your body parts file in blender, and import the animtion smd file there, and you will see your ellie do the animation you choose. sry for my bad english hope i could help you

You can watch out animation in Noesis very fastly (just the skel but it is helpful to find out quick )

How you extract? Do you just drop the files on the Tool ? You have to do it with cmd and dont forget the "/r" at the end

Has anybody gotten the .ascii working that the tool exports? 

I have tried a couple of importers for blender and ascii plugins for noesis bot none seem to work out of the box.
The .smd that the tool outputs work perfectly fine, but only they contain only one UV set and most models rely on multiple uv sets (for things like dirt etc) so i wanted to see if the .ascii contained the other uvs but have not managed to import nor open them.

viewtopic.php?p=183734#p183734

I have tried that one as well, throws a traceback error on all the models ive tried so far.
edit: that noesis importer does seem to work on most of the extracted .ascii from the pak68 directory just not the actor97 exports



the .smds the tool outputs are just fine however.

This is the "official" xps plugin for Noesis, works for me:  [http://xnalara.org/viewtopic.php?t=1139](http://xnalara.org/viewtopic.php?t=1139)

For Blender, use XNALaraMesh: [https://github.com/johnzero7/XNALaraMesh/releases](https://github.com/johnzero7/XNALaraMesh/releases)

Both import the ascii format produced by iddaemon's tools.

thanks! i had messed around with those tools as well during my quest. It seems it can open/display some of the actor97 .ascii while others throw errors. static actors seem to work most of the time, while objects with skeletons seem to straight up fail. 
is there a specific step one should take to extract those?

blender does not like the .ascii it seems using XNALaramesh addon but i suppose i could convert it in noesis to another format

Remember to copy and paste the skeleton at the beginning of the model files.  For example, for Abby you would copy and paste the abby-skel_skel.abby-skel.ascii into the beginning of the abby-backpack_C1CCA4F4_0.ascii; make sure to replace the first line:

0
5
submesh_0

becomes

<skeleton data from abby-skel_skel.abby-skel.ascii>
5
submesh_0

you can get to the .paks by extracting a TLOU2 .pkg file using the ps4 PKG tool [https://github.com/pearlxcore/PS4-PKG-Tool](https://github.com/pearlxcore/PS4-PKG-Tool)
This will get you the content archived as .psarc files which you can extract with noesis.
these extracted files will give you the .paks that u can use the tools with.

Hi Daemon, what is the fastest way to extract all game textures from the various folders? I am using your map tool and extracting the .PAKs and then dropping the texture desc file onto the tool to extract the textures, the textures extract fine but the textures for some of the models are fragmented all over the game. What is the fastest way to extracy EVERY texture in TLOU2? is there a tool for this? Thanks!

with the new tool, how should we make auto-texturing to work? do we have to place all of the textures in one folder alongside with the mesh? just like laraascii? can you explain a bit?
Also can we get Uncharted 4 to work with this new tool that you placed? ( I mean blender py plugin)

i will explain in details once i have time
but quick answer is...
- if you use johnzero plugin, you need to place all of the textures in one folder
- if you use this new SecaProject plugin, they will load from folder structure

and yes, i plan to change Uncharted 4 tool

is there a faster way than doing every .PAK one at a time? I'm having to manually go down the list of each individual PAK and do them manually. Great tool by the way! if theres a fast way to extract all 40GB of textures id love to hear it!

I dont understand your problem. dont use any lists. Use whole paks, it extracts all 40GB in a few minutes if you have ssd. Its only limited by the speed of your drive.

Sorry let me rephrase, what .PAK are you dropping onto the tool? my workflow is as follows. 

Exporting the PSARCS from noesis. 




From noesis im going into pak.68 folder and then dragging one of the .paks onto your tool. 
 



Should I not bother with the individual .paks in the extracted folder from noesis and just drop the dict texture file from the texturedict3 onto the tool?

I'm using orbis to extract and the passcode is 32 zeroes, see if that works 00000000000000000000000000000000

I think you underestimate my levels of compitence Daemon haha, I am a total NOOB and have no idea how to make a batch, I guess ill just extract the textures from each psarc and merge the folders at the end?

hmmmm I extracted all the texture dicts from every game psarc folder, there are textures missing from the game files using this tool, the _textures.txt file inside the pak68 folder contains the names of the correct textures but the texture ripping tool for the maps doesnt extract all the files properly, its like half the textures are missing from the list. Heres a screenshot of the _textures.txt file inside texture dict3 folder after dropping the .pak on your tool. the end of the list is half finished.

if you dont want to export all textures, then make a text list of all textures ans search through it.


So, I think you're saying that if the texture hasn't been extracted then it'll get assigned the missing texture file?  I'll check again and make sure I've extracted everything.  Thanks!

Can I see how youve got your texture folder structure setup for the plugin? Daemon maybe you could post a short video video tutorial showing how to use your tool and the plugin so we know how to get auto texturing to work? im very confused and having throuble getting mine to auto texture the asciis, thanks again!

it seems there was some error and process crashed in the middle.
Make sure you have enough space, also filenames are very long, so run extraction from some very short path like "C:\tex"

It depends on which importer you use. if you are using the secascii importer then u need to preserve the export hierarchy, other importers usually expect the textures to be put right next to the model in a folder.

for secascii the texture library should look something like this: 



note: the z_ folder can be deleted as it mostly contains lightmaps and reflection probe data and such, for use in their game engine (and kinda useless data for our needs)

as the map tool from Daemon1 writes the textures into the ascii (all referenced textures are mentioned in the model_shaders.txt / model_textures.text the tool also exports)
example of the theater: 


the blender script then just reads the data from the ascii and appends the path u give it, making the full path for the first two textures.
(i got it on my C drive, and converted the whole lib to .tga)



so in my case i put down: C:/TLOU2-DICT/common/texture4
and the script appends the art/shared/background/asset-library/textures/wires/wires-ground-a-color.tga
creating: C:/TLOU2-DICT/common/texture4art/shared/background/asset-library/textures/wires/wires-ground-a-color.tga
which is the exact location the file is at.

the importer will complain in the log about any missing data: (in this case a couple textures that got lost during my batch conversion to .tga)
edit: on second thought these missing texture are due to my -dic.packs being exported with tlou.exe and not tlou_maps.exe. It seems the map tool finds a couple extra textures that the normal tool doesn't.



End result then gives you something like this:




This only works for maps exported with the maptool Daemon1 provided kindly to us. auto texturing is not a thing for other assets (as far as i know) as the .ascii the other tool outputs doesnt save the path into the .ascii (it returns a dummy tlou_#), however it provides a seperate _shaders.txt as well linking all the maps so you can manually reconstruct them. 

Im not sure why it doesn't output a similar .ascii as the other tool as creating such tools is way above my paygrade. 
Maybe daemon1 can be so kind to shed some light on that?, or update the tool so it outputs the same .ascii as the map tool.

Hi thanks this is great, have you extracted all the game textures and merged the folders or just the texturedict associated with the .pak youre loading into blender? Sorry I am really stupid and I still cant get it to work haha perhaps you could post a video of you getting this to work I could follow? Also all my textures are in dds and not tga?

yes i extracted all the game textures. 
The .paks reference textures from all over the place, most are usually in the corresponding -dict.pac but not all of them. 
(things like shared and common materials etc are tucked away all over the different -dict.packs.)
So safest way to failproof load them into blender is by extracting them all.

You can extract them in the -files folder then move merge them together, or just copy all the -dict files to another folder and extract them there.
I went with copy and ran a .bat file that extracted all of them automaticly.

The textures the tool exports are indeed .dds and not .tga. The ascii however reference .tga so you will get file not found errors if you didnt convert those depending on the importer you use. To fix this either:
convert the entire library from .dds to .tga or 
replace all the .tga references with .dds in the .ascii. 
Changing the dropdown to .dds from secascii addon should also do the trick as it appends the extension to the file name.
I think Daemon1 also mentioned this in the post with the map tool.

The textures the tool exports are indeed .dds and not .tga. The ascii however reference .tga so you will get file not found errors if you didnt convert those depending on the importer you use. To fix this either:
convert the entire library from .dds to .tga or 
replace all the .tga references with .dds in the .ascii. 
Changing the dropdown to .dds from secascii addon should also do the trick as it appends the extension to the file name.
I think Daemon1 also mentioned this in the post with the map tool.

You're really helpful, thank you so much! I'll keep you posted once I extract all the textures, I think im getting close to solving this with your help, im too retarded to make my own .bat so I think im just gonna copy all the text dicts into one folder and extract there, I think some of the textures are named the same thing? some of them are 512x512 instead of 1024x1024 DId you find a solution to this? Thank you again!

None of the textures have identicial names so that shouldnt be an issue

the .bat file could look something like this, with all the -dicts and the tool in the same folder.

```
for %%a in (*.*) do ( "tlou2_maps.exe" "%%a" )
```


And yes, textures have different sizes depending how important they are or how near the player can get to them, thats just how games are build. 
most textures are probably between 256-1024 resolution. 
Depends what you want to do with them, you can always modify them or try upscaling them.

I have no idea how to even fill in the empty fields in the bat file so I guess ill just click and drag them 1 at a time, does my unpacked game need to be on the same drive im performing the extraction of the textures on, for example if I copy over the -dicts.pak to my C drive and perform the extraction with the tlou_maps tool there does it make a difference? Does the tool have a dependency on where the files are being unpacked from since id imagine it would ref the pak68 folder? My previous pak has errors halfway through and I think its because the file names were too long so im trying to do the texture conversion on my c drive w limited space haha, not sure if I need the game installed on that same drive etc

just copy paste the snippet to a .bat and run it. No need to adjust anything. The bat basicly just says: 'for all the files with a '.' in their name, run the tool and give the tool that files name' So it will scan the entire folder, and tell the tool to unpack it, go to the next, unpack it, untill it looped the entire folder.

Tool can be wherever, it outputs the files in the same directory as the source. names can be very long and that might cause export issues.
I made a TLOU2 folder on my C: root and exported them in there. So you can just drag the -dict.pack from your C drive folder to the tool on another drive and it will create the output on C

When using the tool with patch1_files\build\ps4\main\actor97\model-viewer.pak I get the following exception:

```
Animation: model-viewer-dina at 11370
Warning! Skeleton bonecount does not match animation.

Unhandled Exception: System.IndexOutOfRangeException: Index was outside the bounds of the array.
   at ?????????????????????????????????????????.?????????????????????????????????????????(String[] )
```

I tried deleting all skeletons relating to Dina but then it had the same issue with an Abby animation, so I'm assuming the skeletons aren't the issue. I'd greatly appreciate any help!

pretty much every animation i extracted has some sort of distortion ( helper bones problem ) .. is that normal finding or did i do something wrong ?


How you extract? Do you just drop the files on the Tool ? You have to do it with cmd and dont forget the "/r" at the end


"/r" with skeleton .. but with animations i just drop them

think you are better off dumping the .pkgs and extracting the textures yourself. 
Extracted and converted to .tga there's about 85gb of data.

no if someone has the map all they need to do is unpack the textures in blender 2.8 or 3.0 and send them via mediafire link or some other sharing site and share them with me

I have all the textures extracted, I was wondering how to automatically assign the textures, I changed them in the .txt file from .tga to .dds, but they still don't show up. Also the UVs on props are messed up is there a way to fix this or do i have to do it manually

Never mind the UVs are flipped vertically so you can either flip the image vertically or the uv vertically.

If it's not too much to ask, could someone explain to me what the best way to reorder/parent the bones of these models is? I've been messing around with Ellie's model and keep getting results like this. From what I can see the issue is the "helper" and "twist" bones aren't parented right, however, I don't know where I should reparent them to fix this issue. Any help is greatly appreciated!

Alright, I've successfully reparented the helpers to the corresponding "normal" bones, meaning I know have working arms and legs, however, I'm still having issues with the jacket and backpack. How should I parent these in order to avoid distortion?

daemon, do you have a discord? there's something up with the maps exe that causes it to assign a missing texture to a mesh instead of the actual texture. this only happens with specific sub-meshes in certain maps, and it is quite annoying to try and search for the right texture. thanks in advance!

I've read that cutscene animations are chunked and are unsupported. What does chunked mean?

Is there any way around this? The cutscene animations are excellent obviously.

can the last of us part 2 tools work on the new The Last of us part 1 game? i would figure yes since from my understanding part 1 is a literal remake using part 2's technology and thus the tools for part 2 would work on part 1. not well versed in toolmaking and such though so i would not know.

Yeah the tools won't work on Part 1. They have to be rewritten. Not sure if daemon is planning on working on this or not.

It depends on which importer you use. if you are using the secascii importer then u need to preserve the export hierarchy, other importers usually expect the textures to be put right next to the model in a folder.

Sorry for spamming, not get on forms a lot.
(Changed the message btw)
Usually, I only read it and I can figure it out by myself. 
I only wanted to know where to find the importer he was using.
But thanks I will try to look it up. 

Got the theater but wanted to try his method. sounds a lot better than how I do it.

He's talking about the secascii_TLOU2.py script.

*my bad. I forgot the secascii script was included in the zip. Thought it was just the .exe's.

Your best bet is to ask for help on GitHub, make a issue where the tool/script is posted.

So, I think you're saying that if the texture hasn't been extracted then it'll get assigned the missing texture file?  I'll check again and make sure I've extracted everything.  Thanks!

No.
There's no such a thing as missing texture file.
This is not related to my tool or extracted textures. This must be your software, whatever you're using.

First of all, I want to thank you so much for the kind work you provide for the community, it's truly awesome!

If you are interested, I updated the secascii.py such that it doesn't create one material for each mesh (which results in thousands of duplicate materials), but one material per shader.

Second, I noticed that for some submeshes, it references the "default-missing" texture in the .ascii file. Why is that? Is it because the extraction tool doesn't know the shader, or that the textures are in some obscure .pak that hasn't been unpacked? To show you an example:

```
200 199 202
199 203 202
201 203 199
submesh_1031_0_shader_372
1

0.286235 0.465066

...

```


I'd love to hear your thoughts on this, thank you so much in advance!

No. Its because the actual texture is called like that, and you can see this texture in one of the PAK files, common-dict.pak

That makes sense. However, it is the culprit of these funky things in the map then:



Theres no way to fix it if its already like this in the .ascii then? Thank you so much!

I've come across these pretty frequently. One thing I've discovered is that the real texture exists in another pak. For example, the tarp on the logs outside Ellie's garage has the 'missing material' texture on it in most of the paks, but I imported the 'epilogue' pak of the same garage, and the tarp had the correct texture. I believe if there's a related pak to the one you're using, you should be able to find the same mesh with the correct material.

The black striped textures are the ones merged in the models file (low res ones) in order to preview and export the high res ones, you have to extract the files and create the original folder structure like this for example (world Bill) otherwise Noesi can't find correct path and shows you lowres ones:
[](https://ibb.co/k3Kswtm)
also you have to edit the fmt_nd_pak.py Noesis script and set the correct path where you have extracted the files for example my one is: 
"TLOUP1": "D:\\ExtractedGameFiles\\tlou1\\build\\pc\\main\\",
or you can use tloupc textures browser tool

 Thank you for your response, it works.  Now, the output consists of 50% high-resolution textures and 50% black stripes. So, do I need to extract all models to obtain all the textures from the game? Some textures, especially the brick textures used for buildings, mostly have black stripes. These textures are also used in different parts of the map. Therefore, I have to rely on the hope that the more paks I extract, the higher the chances of randomly getting the specific textures I need?

When using the Alphazomega tool to export character parts from The Last of Us Part 1 along with the base skeletons as SMD files via Wordpad, I'm encountering an issue where the meshes are not rigged with the joints as observed with the TLOU2 tool. Does anyone have insight into the reason for this difference and a potential solution?

Does a skeleton exist for the Dodge? Within the "anim-melee-npc-t2" directory, there is an animation labeled "npc-f-p-dodge-lt^attack_B813AAA4." However, I was only able to extract this animation alongside the NPC skeleton in the same folder. If there is a separate skeleton available for the dodge animation and you extract it into the same folder, you might discover a standalone dodge animation there.

I only searched for Ellie's dodge and actually didn't end up searching for anything else, so wouldn't be able to comment on the npc stuff. You finding that will make me look some more though.

All I wanted to say is that some animations are in files where you don't expect them
