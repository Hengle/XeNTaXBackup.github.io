- Post Title: Star Trek Online Gibbed extractor not working.

The Gibbed tools seem to be out of date ([https://github.com/PlumberTaskForce/Datamining-Guide](https://github.com/PlumberTaskForce/Datamining-Guide)). When I tried using them, CMD gave me an error about a 32bit program not being able to access the data from a 64bit program. Does anyone have the source code for those tools to compile into 64b, or have the tools already compiled in 64b?

Any word on this?
