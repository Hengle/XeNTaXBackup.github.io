- Post Title: I need to build a setup file for xdelta files. Help

I know how to convert and install xdelta files via batch file but since I want to make user friendly language patch, a setup file that has functions of xdelta.exe would be convenient. I'm not much of a programmer. All I can do is to write 'Hello' in C# xD Can you guys help me on that? If thread section is wrong, I'm sorry in advance ^^
