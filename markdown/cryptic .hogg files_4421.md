I'm in the same boat as the OP from this thread [viewtopic.php?f=10&t=4020&p=34681&hilit=hogg#p34681](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=4020&p=34681&hilit=hogg#p34681)
I'm trying to get some audio files, but i am having no luck with the console tool provided in that thread.  I'll admit i'm most assuredly an ultra-noob.  Anyone care to elaborate a bit on how to use this tool,

 I've been messing around in cmd prompt but not having any luck, any advice?

Ditto. Did you end up working it out?
