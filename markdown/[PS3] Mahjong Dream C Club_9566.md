OK, I feel bad for saying I was going to do this but didn't... so last one before I hit the road...



1.) Get and dump game (don't care how).
2.) I forget if this game used CPK or not... if it does, use QuickBMS to extract CPK files.
3.) Delete the script folder; it contains useless CAT archives that will give errors if you don't delete it.
4.) Place ripper.exe in game root directory.
5.) Run ripper.exe.

Texturing is automatic, but as with any game whose models come in multiple parts, you will have to rename things to get it to work.
Skeletons are present, and each part has its own skeleton; you will have to find a way to merge them.

I got the Dream Club Zero game (for 360) and when I took a look at the files I noticed they are not packed inside a .cpk everything is in a common folder hierarchy, if anyone wanna take a look at the files let me know, because the current ripper can't extract anything.

Yeah, I took a look at some samples from the XBox version a while back and said nawww.... I think I'll wait for the PS3 version to come out . Much easier since it was pretty much the same format as Oneechanbara Z Kagura.

Looks like this half works with the new dream c club special edipyon on ps3. The model and texture format is the same however the .cat archive has changed. You can get the head and hair files out if you change the header of the file cat but but it doesn't work for bodies sadly.

Just assign it as homework to your students or something  
Prof did that to us all the time he called it "extra credit" even though it was clearly for his own hobbies.

Looking back at the files I have found the problem its very simple actually lol. At the end of the list where the positions of the file are instead of ending with ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff it ends with ff ff ff ff. Right now I am just manually getting the data from the archive but this should be easy to fix in the exe.

indeed, the format of the old cat file expected two 0xFFFFFFFF 0xFFFFFFFF in a row.

```
 std::deque<std::pair<size_t, size_t>> header;
 for(;;) {
     uint32 p01 = BE_read_uint32(ifile); if(ifile.fail()) return error("Read failure.");
     uint32 p02 = BE_read_uint32(ifile); if(ifile.fail()) return error("Read failure.");
     if(p01 == 0xFFFFFFFF && p02 == 0xFFFFFFFF) break;
     if(header.size() > 1000) return error("Unexpected number of CAT sections.");
     header.push_back(std::pair<size_t, size_t>(p01, p02));
    }

```


i'm still quite busy at the moment working on some other things, but if this is that easy i'll see what i can do soon.

No it currently isn't the cat files have changed a bit

No rush lol and this time the texture files don't use the extension xpr, they use gtf but no change in the structure
The only other thing really is that only the tmd files for the characters are the same. Field and items and other things have changed but there not important lol
