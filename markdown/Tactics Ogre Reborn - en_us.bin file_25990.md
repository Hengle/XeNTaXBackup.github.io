Hi all, help me please unpack/pack the container containing otf fonts and their textures from the game Tactics Ogre: Reborn (Steam). I have little experience with hex editor. Here is what I managed to find.

I thinking file contains fonts in .otf format and the textures of those fonts are in .btx format.

The file is too big to attach to the post, so I've uploaded it.
