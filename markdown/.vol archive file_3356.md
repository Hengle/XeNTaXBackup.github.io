Well, checked the file listening wise and bumper.vol has raw 8-bit unsigned pcm 11050 khz mono audio (?) and then compressed data in between suggesting the game plays pieces according to progress possibly and joining. 

No RIFF WAV headers contained what i can see unless compressed headers elsewhere in data but if all audio is raw pcm in bigger files, may get them out manually assuming not in many chunks.

uhmmm this is a duplicated thread of the one available also here [viewtopic.php?f=10&t=3354](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=3354)
unfortunately the original author has given no other updates about the correct handling of the other files using the beta tool I provided... maybe he is in vacancy :)
