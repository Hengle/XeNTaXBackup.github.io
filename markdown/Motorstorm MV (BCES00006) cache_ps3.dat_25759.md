- Post Title: Motorstorm MV (BCES00006) cache_ps3.dat

Hey guys so recently I picked up a project with my favorite game of all time, so far everything has been going well as im using resources from the second motorstorm aswell (Pacific rift). Issue comes with the game files are all inside a "cache_ps3.dat" ive tried everything to somehow extract these files and some quickbms scripts that might work but nothing seems to budge. Ive tried to make my bms script but ive come to the conclusion that im not the best xd. This isnt the first motorstorm project I did so idk why im having such a hard time. Does anyone have some sort of a solution or help? I would honestly appreciate it alot as this just put my project to a halt. cache_ps3.dat seems to be common on alot of the older ps3 games so maybe someone already has a solution?

Can you upload your "cache_ps3.dat" file to some hosting site like mega.nz, google drive and then share a public link here?

here you go: [https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/ ... sp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1zI1l5ldVM59D4bo3PfC720GtS7tUqhRQ?usp=sharing)

Might aswell add, that the previous project I did with both motorstorm games, "Motorstorm Pacific Rift" holds the game files in a "psarc" format (Playstation archive) and from looking @ the hex and memory of the ps3_cache.dat file and the original motorstorm game it also seems to be built the same as I found rpk texture files and lua texts. I tried to convert to psarc but I didnt manage. I honestly hope you can pull something off   as I would really appreciate this since me and my friend have been going at this for like 2 days now.
