- Post Title: G1M Help / Fire Emblem Warriors (Switch) (Comission Request)

I already looked, so unfortunately I cannot ask if there is any tools to extract from various g1m files after conversions, so I wanted to post a request. My wishes is for a g1m script that imports directly within 3DS Max (Max Script if you may) or blender/other programs.

Current issues mostly reside around how meshes are currently converted from g1m using Stevens Gas Machine, On various games, after conversions to .smc meshes begin to stretch because of their physic cloth-ness. This also extents out to my current project of grabbing out Fire Emblem Warrior models. Some models are fine, but then they bug out on certain characters. The common theme the characters have is long skits or what not. I don't know what makes them so special, but a character like Lyn, for example breaks.

People have made these scripts before, but then abandoned it. g1m conversion scripts to smc exist, and well as open source (its Steven's gas machine), so I am hoping I wont be asking for too of an impossible task. Most people I can ask are way to busy and I am getting a little tired of waiting on their whims. While I am not desperate for it, I'd like a little improvement so therefor my request. 

Of course this request would be encouraged monetarily. I am a broke Canadian university boi so I can only offer up to 50$ Canadian in equivalent to your currency of choice, I hope that's good enough. However monthly bills for my student loans strings me dry, but I'll do my best. Let me know if there is a better place to request in, I wasn't sure to post this in the code forum, but this does deal with 3D models too. PM me or some odd if you are interested.
