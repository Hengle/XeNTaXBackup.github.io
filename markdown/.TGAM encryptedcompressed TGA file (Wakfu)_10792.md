- Post Title: .TGAM encrypted/compressed TGA file? (Wakfu)

Hey guys

I've been snooping around a bit in free mmorpg [Wakfu](http://www.wakfu.com)'s .jar archives and found these .tgam files. They seem to be packed or maybe even encrypted TGA files. I noticed that new game patches simlpy override these by replacing the XML definition of the filename with a new one (funny enough a NORMAL .tga file, lazy devs ). But I haven't found a way to take a look at these "old" TGAM files. There's an outdated TGAM viewer [here](https://www.zeta-uploader.com/142817243) but it seems like the company changed the file structure since it was released as it spits out half garbage half image now.

Here are four random tgam files from gfx.jar: [https://www.zeta-uploader.com/1708963874](https://www.zeta-uploader.com/1708963874)

Would appreciate any help you can give me

I was linked here by your other topic named "100$ paypal if you can help me with this sprite format", I couldn't help myself but check what it was all about. I am not in a position to help but neither will be anyone else since it seems the link you posted is broken. Just thought you would want to know since you seem so determined in getting help.

Those files do not seem to be encrypted. They have a custom 20-byte header followed by raw data.

```
    CHAR tag[4];
    WORD width;
    WORD height;
    WORD unknown1;
    WORD unknown2;
    WORD unknown3;
    WORD unknown4;
    WORD unknown5;
    WORD unknown6;
}

```


I didn't have time to go further and figure out all the parts of the header (looks like there might be bpp and stride in there) but hopefully that can get you started.

Good luck!
