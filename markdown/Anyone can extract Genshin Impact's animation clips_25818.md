- Post Title: Anyone can extract Genshin Impact's animation clips?

Though there are already thousands of ways to decrypt and extract GI's assets,however,until now,those assets just content Text,Sprite,Mesh and Texture 2D.

What I am interested in is its Animation Clip and Particle System resources,while none of them has been succeessfully extracted!

I've tried many ways before:
UABE:uabe unable to deserialize the assert for viewing;
Asset Ripper:Error during reading of asset type AnimationClip;
AssetStudio:Unable to load object,Type AnimationClip,System.IO.EndOfStreamException:Unable to read beyond the end of the stream;
UnityPy:Error during the parsing of object,unpack_from requires a buffer of at least 44016 bytes for unpacking 4 bytes at offset 44012 (actual buffer size is 44012),Returning the typetree;

It is CB1 and Unity2017,I would appreciate it a lot if anyone can figure it out!
