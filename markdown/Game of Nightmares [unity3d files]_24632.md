The game works on a unity. Asset bundles are packed into an unrecognized archive type. Is there any solution for extraction?

Hi, use this script
[https://github.com/bartlomiejduda/Tools ... script.bms](https://github.com/bartlomiejduda/Tools/blob/master/NEW%20Tools/Game%20of%20Nightmares/Game_of_Nightmares_script.bms)

with quickbms [http://aluigi.altervista.org/quickbms.htm](http://aluigi.altervista.org/quickbms.htm)

Then use AssetStudio on unity3d file.


Btw, I can't find this game in google by this name. Can you link some site with game's description?

Thx! It's working.
The game will launch in two days, but the ios client is already available for download.
