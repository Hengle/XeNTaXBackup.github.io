- Post Title: S4League Seq Files

Hi people.

I am an old s4 league player and I am interested in being able to modify the seq files, I have searched and researched and there is no tool for this type of files so I started researching this file on my own.

Looking at the effects of this file in the game I can deduce that it contains animations, particle generator, billboard model, rendering states and many more, but this is all encrypted.   

Today I was encouraged and decided to try to make a tool with a friend for this type of files, but we are not experts in encryption, I hoped that they would help me with this file, any help would be well received and appreciated.

These are the files that I managed to extract.

Any help is appreciated.
