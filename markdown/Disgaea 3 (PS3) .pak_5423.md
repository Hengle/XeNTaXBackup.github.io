Well, you'll obviously need a custom extractor or bms script to extract everything including the PS ADPCM in there. But for the most part, you can use a WAV extractor to get the ATRAC3plus files out.

Most part of .pak files has been unpacked with WAV extractor(78.8 MB of 83 MB), but not all. Need bms script for fully unpacking.

For extract sfx I use PSound.

At3 audio can be unpacked with Alpha`s WAV extractor bms script.

Thanks bxaimc for help!
