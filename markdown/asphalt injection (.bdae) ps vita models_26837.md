- Post Title: asphalt injection (.bdae) ps vita models

so gameloft .bdae is a common format seen in a lot of games, however since this format is used so much there isn't a proper tool to convert it into a common 3d model format, there are some plugins but they mostly only work on a few games, no asphalt games have a plugin to rip these models, however i want to rip detroit, hong kong, shanghai and rio from the game, i can already extract texture data

bdae was covered lots of time so there's no reason for a bump, imho.
Getting a simple track seems simple (maybe it's for preview only):

The level assets themselves are not too hard to track. (No one will do it for you, I fear.)
