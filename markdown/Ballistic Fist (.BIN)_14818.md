- Post Title: Ballistic Fist (.BIN)

This simple but amazing 2.5D fighting game stored all it resources (Models, animations, etc...) into .BIN files.
Tried all and every BIN extractor that I could use, with no success.
I'm planning to use such characters (And stages, maybe) in EF-12 (3D version of MUGEN), of course, giving all credits to the original authors.
The game is freeware, so Piracy is not a problem.
Would somebody give me a hand?
