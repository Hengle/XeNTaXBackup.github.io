- Post Title: .IKM with OGG stream - Legend of Galactic Heroes (Bandai Namco)

Hey. I couldn't find any useful information (or any information at all, really), so I thought I'd ask here. I wanted to extract the BGM for the PC game adaptation of the Legend of Galactic Heroes anime.

Sample file + filecutter

Thanks for any help.

Hello. In your sample there is only one 4 minute long OGG file after header. If you remove 2048 bytes from the beginning of your file, you will be able to play it in Winamp.

Thank you! I'm new to this so I didn't know I could just delete the bytes (I tried extracting it in VGM Toolbox first).
