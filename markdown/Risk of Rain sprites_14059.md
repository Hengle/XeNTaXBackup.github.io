- Post Title: Risk of Rain sprites

I don't know if this is the right topic, but moving onto my question.

I used quickbms and the yoyogames script and all that nonsense to extract the Risk of Rain data.win file. I have all the garbage spewed into a folder and I found all the image files, but they have the generic FILE extension. I try to change the extension to .png, .jpeg, .gif, etc.; yet they still won't read.

How can I look into these files to get the sprites of RoR? This is all for personal use.

EDIT: I would post an example file that contains an image, but I don't think that's legal.
