- Post Title: IL-2: Cliffs of Dover - SFS archive

Hi all,

This game uses encrypted .sfs files, just like the earlier entries in the IL2 series. However, none of the old il2 .sfs extractors work. I was wondering if anyone would be willing to help figure out how to open these archives up.

can you try and tell me if my sfs.bms script 0.2 works?

remember to check also if you have the latest version of quickbms (0.4.10b at the moment).

it's highly possible that the developers could have changed the encryption method, in which case I don't know if I will work on this because the work is enough
