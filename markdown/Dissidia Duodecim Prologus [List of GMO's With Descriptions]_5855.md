- Post Title: Dissidia Duodecim Prologus [List of GMO's With Descriptions]

Fortunately Dissidia Duodecim Prologus still contained our run of the mill GMO's some of the models are identical to the models used in the previous game (file size and everything). So I spent the last 2-3 hours compiling a list of what all the GMO's in the demo were. This is based on the file numbering received when dumped with [Dissidia Modding Suite](http://dissidiaforums.com/showthread.php?5311-Dissidia-Modding-Suite). Please if you repost this elsewhere give me credit for creating this list.

Note: GMO's with empty descriptions in this list are GMO's that contain bone and animation data only.

So based on this you can see what characters you can fight against as opponents based on what characters have models with full battle animations, and which characters are only assists in the demo such as Laguna because they only have assist models.

Enjoy.


---------------------------------

If anyone can tell me a way I can convert the battle models with rigging intact in an unanimated pose I would greatly appreciate it. Currently I've only been able to achieve getting them in unanimated poses by exporting them from Noesis (or mesh2rdm) without the skeleton at all. And that's great but it leaves me with the tedious task of adding rigging again. Noesis exports the model with rigging just fine. The problem is it exports from the pose that it is displaying on screen/the starting animation frame. So I am unable to get a rigged unanimated pose.

If anyone knows a way I can could convert them with rigging intact and still retain the unanimated pose I'd be very grateful.

Mine are named differently, I used MrAdults' Gitmo, so there PACKAGE_[random numbers]

Some of them that crash Noesis work in Mesh2rdm for some reason.

Dumping the gmo's with Dissidia Modding Suite  (which I linked to in the first post) opens all of them just fine in Noesis. It may be that it's a more recent program but it's just a guess.

I'm fairly certain both Cloud and Leon were given Kingdom Hearts-styled outfits in the new Dissidia Duodecim PSP game.

They aren't in the demo, they are dlc. You have to preorder the game in the US to be able to get them, or buy BBSFM. Not all the models are in the demo.

If you want to export .GMO's with bones still attached, export them as .SMD with Neosis or mesh2rdm =)
Hope that helps you! =D (Made an account just to let you know) XD

Edit: Just reread your post, sorry I didn't notice the part about the neutral pose. When I export models, I usually just position the model in a T-pose manually with 3Ds Max.

I'm hardly forgetting you. I posted a link to where you have your wonderful program.

I got around to looking at this myself, and for the record, Noesis correctly loads every GMO produced by gitmo.

No one should be using mesh2rdm, really.
