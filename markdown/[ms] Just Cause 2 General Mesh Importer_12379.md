- Post Title: [ms] Just Cause 2 General Mesh Importer

Sup,
few moths ago I created this little beauty, since there is no general mesh importer, only viewer, I was tried this.
I used some jc2 rbm tools research and made importer for max but never finished (typical for me).
What does it do? Well:
It imports - Simple Car Paint, General (only some types), Lambert, Facade also can process VegetationFoliage, VegetationBark and Halo but will not import them. 
Other are not supported like Vehicles and Characters etc (and probably never be).
Its created mainly to import General block.
You should change dbg_tpath to set path to general textures folder to track textures.

If you get error like Unknown Block type! or Big Vertex, post here filename and its folder name.
Its made for max2011 and higher(?)
Here its how it works.
