The structure is fairly simple, it goes as the following:

```
{
   int unk1;
   int file_offset;
   int file_length;
   int unk2;
   __int64 unk3;
   char file_name[28];
}

```


Each entry is 0x40 (64) bytes. This isn't a complete structure, but it is sufficient to do the things you want to do.

It's not that hard, just go to the file_offset and extract the data that equals to the file_length in the struct. Then rename that data to .wav and you will be able to play that audio. Also this is a Little Endian format.

The extracted raw data is a headerless wav file, so it won't play in Windows Media Player. I used Audacity to play it, import it as raw data.

I have extracted the first audio entry which is Escapeloop.wav, I'll attach it below.

This looks like a game archive, I'll move this thread to Audio file formats, hopefully someone can put together a quickbms script. I'd do it but I've forgotten most of the syntax as it has been years since I've written one.

Could you also let us know what game this has come from?

Cheers.

Edit:
Just quickly updated this struct.

```
{
   int m_fileID;     //This seems to decrease, I assume it's the file ID, while loop till this is 1.
   int m_fileOffset;
   int m_fileLength;
   int m_sampleRate;
   __int64 m_unk1;
   char m_fileName[28];
}

```


Data does not look compressed so someone will need to write an unpacker that also creates a valid RIFF header.
