Hi mate,

Thanks once again  . Just to note, I don't usually write expansion packs in the plugins or on my supported games list, unless the extension pack has different archives to the normal game.

 Thanks for your continuing help!

OK, well in the next update (1.5507) I have actually made some changes to this plugin, so you can check that out again when I release the update (within a few days). If it still doesn't work, I will need to look at some archives.

Sorry about that - I have not confirmed that this game actually worked - KorNet did the testing.

I have uploaded the newest version - hopefully it will work OK.

I have had some other people say that it works on this game alright, so if you are still having problems then I guess all I can do is take a look at the archive of yours and see what is wrong with it. Very weird.
