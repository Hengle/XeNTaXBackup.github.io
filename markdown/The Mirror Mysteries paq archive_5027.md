- Post Title: The Mirror Mysteries "paq" archive

"The Mirror Mysteries" : [http://www.bigfishgames.com/download-ga ... index.html](http://www.bigfishgames.com/download-games/6964/mirror-mysteries/index.html)

After a whole day of enormous swearing at Armadillo i finally did it.
The paq file is simple .ZIP archive, but it's password protected. To extract the data, rename it to paq.zip and unzip it with your favorite zip extractor, using this password : "path33/p3?4&8, data" (without quotes and there's a {space} between "," and "data").
To make things even clearer, here's a hex dump of the zip password :
\x70\x61\x74\x68\x33\x33\x2F\x70\x33\x3F\x34\x26\x38\x2C\x20\x64\x61\x74\x61

Have fun !
