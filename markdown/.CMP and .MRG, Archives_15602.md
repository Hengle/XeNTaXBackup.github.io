- Post Title: .CMP and .MRG, Archives?

I'm attempting an english translation of visual park for Dreamcast, and there's two extensions I can't find any info on. .CMP, which references to different textures and MRG files, and .MRG which seems to be an archive. Is there a program anyone knows of to attempt opening these?

Attatched both MRG and CMP

Thanks
