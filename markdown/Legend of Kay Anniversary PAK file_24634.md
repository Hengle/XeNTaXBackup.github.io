- Post Title: Legend of Kay Anniversary PAK file

Hello.

I got interest to rip Legend of Kay Anniversary contents and it appears all the assets are stored in pak files. They start with "KPKl" inside the files. Here's a sample, which is the lightest of them all because the others are way too heavy : [https://www.mediafire.com/file/pfef4f6b ... 0.zip/file](https://www.mediafire.com/file/pfef4f6b2e96gah/patch_coregame_0.zip/file)

Help would be appreciated

It seems to be similar to Sacred 3 files [https://aluigi.altervista.org/bms/sacred3.bms](https://aluigi.altervista.org/bms/sacred3.bms)
I heard that script may work for some of the archives.

Thanks  I'll try it tomorrow.

EDIT : It worked, even if all the assets are .dat files.
