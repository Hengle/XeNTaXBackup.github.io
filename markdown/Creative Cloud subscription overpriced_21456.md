- Post Title: Creative Cloud subscription overpriced

I want to know a way to buy some adobe creative cloud programs like photoshop and illustrator WITHOUT a subscription. My student discount expired couple months ago so Iâ€™m paying $57 a month for Adobe CC which is way to fcking much smh. Even just having photoshop is fine with me.
