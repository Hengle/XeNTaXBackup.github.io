- Post Title: LZMA compression

Hi,

Does anyone know what type of compression was used on these files? 

Removed.

I think it might be a form of LZO but not sure.

Thanks.

Edit: The header appears to match that of a LZMA compressed file but trying to decompress with lzma.exe causes an error.

Edit2: nevermind worked it out.
