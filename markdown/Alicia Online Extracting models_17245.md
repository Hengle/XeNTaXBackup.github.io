- Post Title: Alicia Online Extracting models?

Hi I would like to get the models out of a game called Alicia online but ninja ripper or others can't get a handle on it no matter what I do, I was wondering if there was another way to do so, and maybe look in the game's coding

Their demo shows unity

The game is made in unity if so there are tons of tools to rip the files with.

Thank you, do you know if there is anyway for the main part of the game? I've used Ninja Ripper to no avail, and I'm quite confused
