- Post Title: Warhammer 40k Gladius

Hello all, has anyone been able to extract the Gladius game models? They are in .msh file. I have no idea where to begin to decode or script something to read them. Just looking to get something I can edit in blender and export back into the game. I can send the file in question or if someone has already got them converted. If anyone can help please.

You can open the Warhammer 40000: Gladius - Relics of War .msh files with the 3D Object Converter v10.003 (Windows)

How to get the 3D Object Converter v10.003:
Download the 3D Object Converter from [ http://3doc.i3dconverter.com](http://3doc.i3dconverter.com) and install it or download and use the portable version (if you donâ€™t have it yet).
(Or just use the Help/Check for updates... function to get the v10.003.)
