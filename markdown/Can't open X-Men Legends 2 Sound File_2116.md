- Post Title: Can't open X-Men Legends 2 Sound File

Hi !

I've extracted some sound files in *.wav format from the game X-Men Legends 2 with the game extractor by watto which I can't open.
I've tried several players and renamed the files into common formats. But none works.
You guys seem to have a lot of experience with file formats which I  unfortunately don't have.

Can someone of you take a look at the attached file please ?

thank you very much

Christoph

Well, thanks anyway.

I suppose you don't know a website (forum, etc) or somebody I can ask about it ?
