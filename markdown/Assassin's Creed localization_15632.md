- Post Title: Assassin's Creed localization

Hello, guys!

I am an administrator of the Portuguese Assassin's Creed encyclopedia ([http://pt-br.assassinscreed.wikia.com/](http://pt-br.assassinscreed.wikia.com/)). I would like to do a appeal to the localization community.

We are constantly documenting information about the universe of Assassin's Creed in our respective languages. A tool to facilitate the documentation of the information, would help in an indispensable way, we, editors of wikis. You, who are willing to create a text extraction tool, think you will be helping a huge encyclopedic community of Assassin's Creed in several languages.

Only with the help of this tool ([viewtopic.php?f=10&t=3005&p=58125#p58125](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=3005&p=58125#p58125)), I was able to create the memory articles of the Assassin's Creed Brotherhood much more easily than I would have done them manually. Example: [http://pt-br.assassinscreed.wikia.com/wiki/Reuni%C3%A3o](http://pt-br.assassinscreed.wikia.com/wiki/Reuni%C3%A3o)

I was able to unveil canon translations that I have never seen before, with the help of a tool.

So, I would like to ask the community to develop a tool for extracting texts, not only to help the translation community, but also the encyclopedic community.

Me, like all editors of wikis and translators, would be eternally grateful to all the contributors of this achievement.

Best Regards,
TheCreedX
Portuguese Assassin's Creed Wiki Administrator

Hi,

We are looking after the exact same thing on the french Wikia  With this tool, we managed to extract the text for Ezio's trilogy and to find some really interesting stuff (I don't know if you tried the tool on Assassin's Creed II and Assassin's Creed: Revelations, but it works on those two games), and are now wanting to extract the text from Assassin's Creed III and others. So... An answer would be very cool.

Yes, it works for Assassin's Creed II and Revelations (and Brotherhood, also), but not for Assassin's Creed III, the game we want to extract the text from :/ And it's not for a translation, just to complete some incomplete articles on our wikia.

Here are the files. The .forge contains localization files among others, and the localization_package are the localization files themselves.

If you can't wait anymore, make your own, there's a lot of information of the forge files on internet, anyone with some programing skills can do:

Hey.
Below is the link to my tools to export LocationPackage to txt and import it back.

```
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YaJHhYO7HdBlrImqWhNvVKABlCNzpQgu
```

I tested it on Assassin's Creed Unity, but should work with other games in the series.
Localization file first must be properly unpacked with Delutto tools:
Ubisoft Forge Tool and Ubisoft DATA Tool.

File 42-FontManager_0X1A36B0959.1641561018 can now be edited in hexeditor.
In file we are looking ECA7A670 value.
Next 4 bytes are the size of ttf file.
Next starts ttf file.

For example:

First ttf file.
Offset 1Fh – ttf size = 000495BC
Offset 23h – Start of ttf file


Second ttf file.
Offset 0495F6h – ttf size = 00042104
Offset 0495FAh - Start of ttf file
And so on…

After editing the ttf file we can replace it and modify the size.

If the game is already using the Latest Update, is the file that needs to be edited or modified is the Update file or is using the Forge data file that is not updated?

For example, for the game Assassins Creed III [Not Remaster] to the data named "DataPC_DX11_10_dlc.forge" for the latest updates. When editing the initial data with the name "DataPC_DX11.forge" (initial file without DLC), is it possible or not?

Why don't you try it before asking something that you can do it yourself ?

I use Delutto and Robin Tools. Export, decompress and unpack to text are done. Repack from text to data is done, as well. But the problem is that 
Ubisoft_DATA_Tool ignore modifications on data file and restore original one.
How do you do it?

1.  Copy original forge_file to Ubisoft_Forge_Tool folder.
2.  Ubisoft_Forge_Tool.exe -e forge_file forge_folder
3.  Copy compressed LocalizationData from forge_folder to Ubisoft_DATA_Tool folder.
4.  Ubisoft_DATA_Tool.exe GameCode -e LocalizationData LocalizationData_folder
5.  Copy uncompressed LocalizationData from LocalizationData_folder to aclocexport folder.
6.  aclocexport.exe LocalizationData
7.  Translate LocalizationData.txt.
8.  aclocimport.exe LocalizationData.txt
9.  Copy LocalizationData.txt.out to LocalizationData_folder replacing original file.
10. Ubisoft_DATA_Tool.exe GameCode -i LocalizationData LocalizationData_folder
11. Copy compressed LocalizationData.new to forge_folder replacing original file.
12. Ubisoft_Forge_Tool.exe -i forge_file forge_folder
13. Copy modified forge_file.new to game folder replacing original file.

There is a problem with step 10. 
The new data created by Ubisoft_DATA_Tool, actually contain original contents not modified one. You can test it: if you decompress LocalizationData.new and convert it to txt, you see is same as original LocalizationData.txt not translated one.

Hey.
Below is the link to my tools to export LocationPackage to txt and import it back.
Code: Select allhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1YaJHhYO7HdBlrImqWhNvVKABlCNzpQgu
I tested it on Assassin's Creed Unity, but should work with other games in the series.
Localization file first must be properly unpacked with Delutto tools:
Ubisoft Forge Tool and Ubisoft DATA Tool.

Thank you for these tools. Worked with AC Rogue.
How about sharing the source code?

For those who want to extract fonts from the game data files, I created a Python script (based on the proposed steps earlies in this forum):
[https://github.com/mortalis13/GameRipSc ... ctor_ac.py](https://github.com/mortalis13/GameRipScripts/blob/master/font_extractor_ac.py)

It would need a data file extracted using the Delutto tools.
So passing the final "...Font Manager..." file in the script, it searches for the font staring markers (ECA7A670) and extracts the binary data to .TTF files in the export folder.

It was tested with AC Syndicate...
