When I import an wwe12 model into wwe13, he looks over shiny (bug with the lighting).
How do you get rid of that? I fixed the emotion problem on his face but I still have the shiness problem.
What is weird is that it only happen when the model comes first, when I make him come second for a match it works fine...

Second question, does anyone knows in what pac file the superstars pics are stored?

I'd relly appreciate some help. 
I've made Faarroq and Kama NOD but my Ahmed johnson (wwe12 Ezequiel) has the shiness bug...
I know that Draven has find a way but he's hard to reach.

Thanks!
