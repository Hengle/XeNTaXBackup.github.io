So I know that somebody already asked about this, but they never received an answer.
While browsing through the files, most of it seems to be in something called "data.epk".
Now, I have no idea how to extract files from the .epk. Does anybody here know?

If I am just going about it wrong, what would I use to get the models from the ISO?

UGH, wrong spot. Can a moderator move this?
