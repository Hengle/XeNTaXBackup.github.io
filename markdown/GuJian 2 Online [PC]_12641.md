- building and item are not supported
For import select *.xac files, not *.rawXAC.

Could someone explain to me how to use a mirror site? I'm not able to read the website or mirror pages and can't find a fast mirror for this game.

@Szkaradek123 Great! But I found that support animation is not very perfect, hope Szkaradek123 can solve this problem, it would be perfect!
