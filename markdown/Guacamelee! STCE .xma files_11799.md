- Post Title: Guacamelee! STCE .xma files

Hello folks!
First of all, that's my first post on this forum, so I wanted to say hello.

But back to the topic. I have problems with .xma files extracted from Xbox version of Guacamelee! STCE. I can't figure out how to make them work and I tried many times with different tools.

Sample:

Use QuickBMS and Alpha23's XMA Transform script on the XMA file. This will give you another XMA file but it has a different header.

Take that new file and convert it with ToWAV

When I try to use the script I'm getting 'error: invalid operator p'

Okay! I was using older version of QuickBMS. Everything works now. Much obliged!
