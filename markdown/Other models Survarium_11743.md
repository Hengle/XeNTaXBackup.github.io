- Post Title: Other models Survarium

Hello. Who can help? I want to open any model of Survarium.db. 
Open the archive, you can use this post. ( viewtopic.php?f=10&t=11424 ) Then I took the script for 3d max and here - ( viewtopic.php?f=16&t=11479 ) The script does not open the weapon model, anomalies. Can anyone help with the opening of the models? 
When open arms with a script, I receive an error.
