- Post Title: Outlast 2

Hi is there any working tool for extracting models from Outlast 2? I was shocked when I found out that Umodel doesn't support this game since first outlast was supported and second one is created on UE4. So is there any working tools? Would be really nice.

TL:DR 
Basically chance for UModel to support this game is equal/close to none.
Unless someone will spend a lot of time to write UModel support for this, or some importer from scratch.
Your best bet would be to use Ninja Ripper.
