You can find the source of the tool here: [http://zenhax.com/viewtopic.php?f=12&t=645](http://zenhax.com/viewtopic.php?f=12&t=645)
Just download Autoit and the BinaryUDF and you can build it.

I will upload the exe, if you can't make it.

I can't extract the ozzyarchive.ara file in the xbox version game.
