But no one want to do it :(((
maybe if you stop to annoy people with PMs and mails with 10 megabytes of attachments then "Aluigi" could change idea.
I check this forum everyday so any pm or mail is totally USELESS.

to know if a wft file is locked or not zmodeler checks if there is the number 0x3f806f48 in a particular position within the first section of the file.
so I guess that substituiting that number with another one "could" work but I have not tested.
who wants to test it try the following scripts:
[http://aluigi.org/papers/bms/gta4wft_unlock.bms](http://aluigi.org/papers/bms/gta4wft_unlock.bms) (if you have the latest version of quickbms)
[http://aluigi.org/papers/bms/gta4wft_unlock_old.bms](http://aluigi.org/papers/bms/gta4wft_unlock_old.bms) (if you still have the old one, requires the packzip tool)

I doubt this is enough but maybe works, try

this is a nice idea too !

but i've tryed to imported the unlocked file but all i got are dummis !

@ Aluigi : could you check that plz ? and sorry to bother you bro !

i wish you all best luck  and thx

wtf are you doing man? ..since when are you interested in ripping off starving artists such as yourself? because that's all this tool would do- unless of course, you're not the legitimate Salim aka SLD who's very well known in this modding/modeling community - there are no locked files indigenous to gtaIV or EFLC (or any game for that matter), so as always, the only thing this blasphemous tool would do, is allow no talent wannabe modding hacks (like NFSX) to unlock Zm2 exported content so they can steal our hard work - honestly people, who gives two shits about multi-million dollar corporations that get paid BANK to create models via laser scanner, straight up, that's "thanks for the model people, you rock" - but stealing content from artists that do NOT get paid for what they do is phuckn weak.. especially when these no talent thieves have the same opportunities the rest of us do, which is to grab the original model from any game they want.

Luigi, please stop work on this god forsaken tool, all it does is create monstrous little pre-puberty children (again, like NSFX) that modify our hard work which we already share for free.

That's not the same thing.

Use games cars is not the same thing than use "Moders" cars. If you want to convert a car to GTA, just create one or ask for permission to convert other people cars.
If you are so f*kin lazy to do it then find another hobby. People like me or kotton have lots of work to make-convert cars to gta

Tools like this will only allow lazy people to stole other peoples work!

For example, if "Mr.X" release QuickBMS with other name saying that "Mr. X" made it, i think that you, Luigi will not be very happy!

So, please, don't do this tool!!!

But the problem is - the most GTA cars are just Forza, Shift, TDU... ... ... Conversions and NOT your hard work.

Okay maybe assigning the right Materials but that's almost the whole work.

But if you have Scratch Made Cars which you created then I think that's not okay...

Stupid Kid!!!

And when real modders get tired of being stolen and stop doing cars for gta, what the f*ck will you do????

lol...

sommergemuese, the cars we do, are not 100 % game cars.  That's why noobs like NFSX want them!

Like Kot's veyron: The base car is from NFS (I think), but he did many things from scratch as the spoiler, HQ stuff and all that. I convert cars from Modelers as Ken7394...

not only do you run up @our forum telling everyone you're going to rip off all of their mods (mine included), and there's nothing we can do about it, and get yourself banned in the process, but it seems you're also illiterate - I'm not starting any flame war THIEF - I'm simply asking a well known respected member of the modding community (Luigi) to turn his back on you and not look back

@sommergemuese; every single one of my mods has scratch work invested in it, and every single one of them have been drastically improved upon from the original version- 
which is why my scratch work does not get released to the public - mentally wetoded a**holes such as nfsx makes it impossible to

you right. And if there's nothing, Is it uncrackable too?

Honestly i think that people like Kot or Threep (and many other) have more influence than you.  So i think that, even if you get that tool, We can always find another to to lock it.  

Everything is LOCKABLE, remember this!

This is utter crap.
All cars for GTA4 are from EA NFS Series, TDU, Grid and Juiced2.
So dont be an (....) and forget it.
So its NOT their rights to lock the cars FROM COMPANIES.
And converting just take some few days or less.

Its like "hai ai iz convertin a car fom ea and ai lok dis kar"

Kotton, you suck, most of "your" cars are from games
and claiming thats your work.

And besides, they acts like sissy girls.

lol I suck? ..YOU SWALLOW
happy happy joi! another uneducated talentless monkey come to play
back up your mental diarrhea, show me one conversion that I've done where I've claimed it as mine and mine alone
AND show me one conversion that I've done that took me "some few days or less" you ass 
and again, since all of you etards bent on defending this useless tool obviously cannot read,
I do NOT publicly release any of my full scratch projects because of wannabe modders and thieves such as yourself

and the only reason I refer to my mods as mine is because I invest a significant amount of scratch work into each and every one,
meticulously improving upon the given mesh to produce the kind of quality that continually alludes people such as yourself- which 
in turn, makes me an active AUTHOR of said mod -good day
(btw, how in the HELL is using a 3d program to read a scanner's input considered scratch work? ..it's not scratch, it's generated)

hello, i've read this thread and i must say.. STOP DEVELOPING THIS TOOL!
this tool is gonna be seeking unlocking .wft files and stealing them and modify them without permission, the biggest problem in SA with .dffs, there isnt any way to keep them unlocked
wft files cant be until now unlocked and they mustn't be neither.
so please, don't help him, this guy (nfsx) got banned on our forum (kottons chop shop) for releasing cars without asking author permission.

nope, I don't see any modelers named nfsx, I don't see any converters named big bear and I damn sure don't see any artists named sommergemuese or pawlo

which is exactly why all of the aforementioned possess self righteous disrespectful attitudes towards those of us who are modelers, converters and artists-
you gentlemen have no clue what goes into our mods- granted, there will always be tons of noobs that do straight conversions which quite literally take a 
game model and make it worse (pawlo) ..but we're not talkn about those kats, we're talkn about people with legitimate skills which flip something good into something
phenomenal and one of a kind- be a man, admit it- these people's works are the ones you want to unlock because nobody's interested in unlockn a pile of shyt-
the only fans of this tool you'll get are the ones that are jealous of our work because they lack the talents, skills and patience to do what we do-
(which tells me all I need to know about the child and/or children that create the tool itself)

and for the record, of course there will eventually be an unlocker, that's a given- we just don't want someone as skilled and respected as Luigi associated
with such lowly scandalous filth- but he was already annoyed with you and your humping of his leg before we stepped in, so I'll consider our job done here xD

btw, my Vey is originally from NFS- how could I release it 4 months before Forza Studio was even thought of? (gawd your an effn genius dude) lol

edit- @sommergemuese, yup, I'm a sweet tasting, everybody wants me pussy (you kno, that thing you never get), why am I a pussy? 

because I am what I eat ..with that in mind, maybe we should call you dick eh?

lol, this says a god damn Converter.

Lol dude you don't know anything I'm doing so shut the fuck up!

If you want respect create legit Mods and not Ripped from Games oO

It is so pathetic most stealers are GTA Modders... (I don't know any game with so many converts from TDU, all NFS, now Forza 3 and thousand other Games. Scratch Made Cars are very rare and the creators of these are the only one I can give respect for their great work.)

And by the way: I'm more into GTR 2 Modding and there is nothing locked and all is working very well without any problems. Of course here and there is one Idiot but thats everywhere. Oh wait GTA is the Kiddie Game with 12 yr old Wannabes who Rip all the Stuff from another Games and think "Oh we have to protect it"

I don't need this tool here. So I don't care if it will be Released or not.

But thanks that I'm able to see pathetic converter wannabes. I have enough now. I have to laugh all the evening.

hi !

i'm Salim Ljabli ! i don't know who used my account to post the first post here !
it wasn't me i've changed my password now .

@ NfsX : could you just tell us why you want to unlock GTA4 locked files ? and which one do you need ?
maybe you really love to get a model from GTA4 but you know the release of this tool will make GTA4 modding down again .

@ sommergemuese : could you please stop working on this project ? my models converted by some friend were stollen and sold many time  , i don't even get credit , and i'm not the only one who got stollen many of my friend had the same problems and it's also the reason why most of us leaved the public Modding and we do not release our models for public use anymore .

i hope you'll understand me ! and you could do something about it .


best regards
Salim Ljabli

All cars for GTA4 are from EA NFS Series, TDU, Grid and Juiced2.
So dont be an (....) and forget it.
So its NOT their rights to lock the cars FROM COMPANIES.
And converting just take some few days or less.

yeah but how can you explain to the 5% of the guys witch actually  make a scratch model on witch spend half of year, that a retarded 12 kid who used the unlock tool makes a 5 mins  convert to other game (or puts a nitro , 20 kilos subwoofer , 20 inch rims and then call it a drift car) and says it's his model?!? (and if you prove that your the author will say:"oh I've got it from a friend didn't know the author, screw you anyway" )

there is 1 thing when you buy a game and use the models from it also saying the game where you've got it 
and other is when a people witch works hardly in his spare time to model (and then shares it for free) gets his model stolen and  edited w/o even crediting the author

@anyone
I don't know who gave you the idea that I'm working on this "stuff", anyway except for that 5 minutes test (that failed) I'm NOT interested in this project.
so who wants to lost his time playing with floats and other boring stuff to "unlock" something that can work with any other editor that supports this wft format (because locking is a zmodeler-only feature), feel free to do it.
definitely not me.

I help novice modders how to convert cars for games. I convert cars for few games(NFS Shift, GTA 4, WR2, FVR, AFC11, RFACTOR, SIMBIN Games, NFS MW... ) but only private and no release because i think no fair for developers games. What about .wft unlocker I have no interested.
Sorry for my bad English.

Allright. Now listen up.

Our message in short: 


Stop flaming nfsx and get this back on-topic. 


The long message: 

The Craptain and I have been reading up on this thread and it looks like some Domestic Code of Honour upheld by a group of amateur GTA4-car modellers has been blasphemied, are we right? This alleged Code of Honour dictates that (we'll try to draw it up as we go along based on what we've read so far, feel free to correct it.)

1. It is okay to mod GTA4 by either converting cars from other games, or creating them from scratch (fact).  
2. It is okay to use whatever means available to you to mod GTA4 and get your car in, even dropping in on public forums to let people do the hard work for you (fact). 
3. It is okay to try and prevent other people from using the imported cars by 'locking' them (fact)
4. It is okay to boast in public about the new car you got into GTA4 (assumption)
5. It is mildly okay to share the new car with close friends, but do not let the public have it (assumption)
6. It is okay to detect possible breaches of the Code of Honour by people who are not part of your group and flame them (fact). [/color]

We may have missed some rules, sorry about that. 

In any event, let us tell you what the XeNTaX Game Research forum is about: 

Share and respect. 

Share. If you have information that will enable other people to mod their favourite game, share it. 
Respect. Respect those who make it possible to mod your favourite game. Those who do the research and program the tools.  

By seeking out ways to mod your game, you must agree to let the public have the same possibility at our forum. 
nfsx is creating a tool that will unlock a multitude of models from different games. Models that have just been locked out of vanity, I understand. It looks rather silly if you start claiming intellectual property of a mod after you have violated the intellectual property of the game's original creators. 

Lastly, Luigi was bugged by nfsx. We can relate to his feelings, that can be annoying. So stop bugging Luigi. If you have a question about this or that format, post a thread, don't PM senior forum members for special favours.

1.) some of us makes plain converts out of other games
2.) even those plain converts take up like 30-40 hours
3.) many of us adds scratch works onto their cars (TDU cars, for example, have no chassis mesh, engine and trunk bay, NFS Shift/Forza3 cars doesnt have door sills, Forza3 cars have veery undetailed engines, and so on)
4.) many of GTA4 modders actually use their/their friends' scratch made meshes. I guess no one likes to see their work stolen and uploaded by other people.

Many of those meshes you can gain access to by writing an e-mail to the converter/author/whatever you guys like calling us. But, just once, try to drop a really decent mod to any GTA episodes, not just like what those 12-yrs old kids do, then you'll see why we are against this tool.

And, without any means to flame, if nfsx really could make his own scratch models, why does he need an unlocker? And, if he really can make the code on his own, why did he post it here?
