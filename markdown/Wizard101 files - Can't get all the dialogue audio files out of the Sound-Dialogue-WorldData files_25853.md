- Post Title: Wizard101 files - Can't get all the dialogue audio files out of the Sound-Dialogue-WorldData files

First of all, I apologize for not providing screenshots, as most of these happened on my laptop and I didn't take screenshots of it when it happened.
I have the latest QuickBMS script and also an older version and I've used both versions to extract Wizard101's sound files. 
Basically my problem is I know it's not extracting all the sound files. I want to get all the files out because I'm wanting to make a Jinriki UTAU voicebank of Malistaire Drake and Belladonna Crisp, and also Dr. Jackall if they've got enough lines of dialogue. (For those of you who don't know what that is, a Jinriki UTAU is where you make a voice synthesis bank cobbled together from voice acting from movies, TV shows/anime, singers or in this case, video games. This link explains what Jinriki UTAUs are: [https://vocadb.net/T/7095/jinriki-vocaloid](https://vocadb.net/T/7095/jinriki-vocaloid) )
When I extracted it with the latest version of the QuickBMS KIWAD script it skipped Malistaire's first few lines of dialogue (as was evident by it starting on #3 or something) and I'm almost positive he's got a lot more dialogue than just 10 lines even if the first 2 files had extracted properly. Belladonna Crisp's dialogue was ENTIRELY absent from the Wysteria file as well, and she has a lot of lines. Likewise, I couldn't find Dr. Jackall's dialogue anywhere in the Marleybone file.
However, when I used the older version it gave me a clue. I used it on the Wysteria file, and it gave me a whole bunch of files for Belladonna Crisp's dialogue that hadn't been there before. Unfortunately though, they were all 0 bytes in size and Windows Media Player gave me an error message like "Windows Media player encountered an issue playing this file" or something like that. It looks like the QuickBMS script is failing to extract a portion of the files properly for some reason. 
I've had experience getting 3D models out of exotic file formats before (see my Cars 2 model escapades) and I've also got experience with Audacity databending as well as very, VERRRRYYYY basic knowledge of hex editors so I'm not afraid to do a bit of detective work to get the files out. However I must admit that I have next to no programming/coding experience besides knowing how to write a Hello World program in Java and knowing the hexadecimal digits, so I might need any technical explanations dumbed down a bit   
I've also included the three dialogue data archives for experimentation and analysis here.

Thank you so much for reading, and do let me know if you've got any questions!
