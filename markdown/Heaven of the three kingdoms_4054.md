Strange it created to threads and one without a archive, this is the correct one, can I delete the other thread?

Will try the zip.bms script

Edit: Unknown zip signature

yeah I know and that is why it was a longshot  I can only read archives when they are plaintext, haven't gotten to the level when I actually analyze things deeper. If it says PK in the beginning I know what to do, but other than that I just get lost

maybe give a scan of signsrch over the executables and dlls of the game, the used algorithm could be a known one (aes, blowfish, rc4, tea and so on)

Ok, after some research I have found that there are in some way 2 versions of the game called three kingdoms. Seems to come from same site but totally different game. I have downloaded the new game witch seems to have newer and more nice models. The old was very low poly.

Here is a 3kb archive. Seems all archives start the same
