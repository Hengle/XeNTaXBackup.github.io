- Post Title: Ragnarok Origin - Extract PKG UnityFS

Hello guys,
I'm new at this modding world... I need just some tips, I'm not asking anybody to do that for me, just want to know how to do...
Game is Ragnarok Origin: [https://ragnarok-origin.br.uptodown.com ... d/download](https://ragnarok-origin.br.uptodown.com/android/download)
File (1.5gb) : [https://drive.google.com/file/d/10mjQcg ... sp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/10mjQcgKHplrE3NbwD51y05Qd8EiXojVS/view?usp=sharing)

The hex looks like this:

So based on teh info that i know nothing about that, what should I do? xD
I have done some research and saw some topics telling to remove the first 32bits, well I think it is the code before the "UnitFS" right? Well, I have tried that, but when I load it agani no assetstudio there is only a snigle image, and I dont think a 1.5gb pkg has only a snigle image file xD

Thank you soo muchh !!

Also looking. I tried deleting the first value in the hex editor but nothing shows up in asset studio.
