Though I can't test this myself, I will try to help. I'll assume you already have an XBox 360 iso of the game.

First you need to extract the files from your ISO. There are many ways to do this, but just try this one first...
1. Download [mesh2rdm](http://richwhitehouse.com/index.php?content=inc_projects.php#prjmp4) and extract the zip to somewhere on your PC.
2. Open a command prompt and navigate to the folder containing mesh2rdm.
3. Enter the following: 
```
mesh2rdm youriso.iso out
```
 where youriso.iso is the path of your XBox 360 iso. This should extract everything in the iso. All the filenames will begin with "out_".

Then you can download [Noesis](http://oasis.xentax.com/index.php?content=downloads) and try loading the .bin models that (hopefully) got dumped. (I'm not sure if the .bin files will be there or if they're inside another container file.)

I can't be 100% this will work, but it's the best I can do for now.

lol no one said they hate you most people here are just sick of people not reading
a few posts up i stated use quickbms on those linkdata files.
so you say ok but what is quickbms.
at this point you should ask how do i use that and someone would respond.
or use the better method of downloading the program and try it yourself there is even a guide for it hjere in tutorials.

Hi everyone.

I open the model file with Noesis but there are no texture on any of the character file.
I can view the Items model with texture but not for the character.
I also know that there is a folder called "Texture" and contant 57 files of G1T files, which has named with the character's name.
However, when I try to open it with Noesis, Noesis said that it can not be perview.
I google up for "G1T texture file" but I found not thing about viewing or extracting it.

Please help, Thank.

Chrrox, do you know if Dynasty Warriors 6 models are viewable as well? 
I extracted the files from linkdata.bin with RPGViewer. 
Tried opening those with Noesis, but no luck.

Hi chrrox, I can not find your quickbms script for extracting the Linkdata from Hokuto Musou (Xbox 360) anywhere.
Is it possible for you to post it up again please.

Thank you
