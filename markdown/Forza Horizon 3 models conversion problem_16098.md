Hello community  There is any way to fix steering wheel and gear stick scale somehow for FH3 3D models ? I use 3DS Max only and can someone explain what settings i need to use for it ?

I use this lesson: [Forza Horizon 3 Models & Textures Conversion Tutorial](http://streetlegalmods.com/tutorials/misc-games/Forza-Horizon-3-Models--Textures-Conversion-Tutorial) but some car parts have wrong scale, some need mirror in 3DS Max, some have wrong dimensions (not 1:1) and also some parts separated. For models i use this page: [Nissan Silvia S14 K](http://gamemodels.ru/files/file/6476-nissan-silvia-s14-ks-aero-mkvi-98/)

Why didn't reply on 'Forza Motorsport Resource Extraction (.carbin)' topic?
