Hello,

I'm wondering if anyone might know how to extract these .BZZ files from Monster's Inc Scare Island/Scream Team (PSX)
They likely contain textures and game files.

A thread concerning .bzz from a similar PSX game is linked here, if that may help:

I'm afraid this is all a bit out of my depth and would be very grateful for any help here.

Link to a couple of sample .bzz files for you:

Many thanks,
