- Post Title: Starshine Legacy *.PME load module released

I finished my Starshine Legacy *.PME and the old (before 2016) Star Stable Online .PME load modules.

I have released the following program:
- 3D Object Converter v10.403 (Windows)

How to get the 3D Object Converter v10.403:
Download the 3D Object Converter from [ http://3doc.i3dconverter.com](http://3doc.i3dconverter.com) and install it or download and use the portable version (if you don’t have it yet).
(Or just use the Help/Check for updates... function to get the v10.403.)

ah no I just mean like if one of them is a mesh, theres no way to also get the armature for animation purposes out of it?

I was wondering this too. I have the files extracted and can pull up the models with texture in Blender but I can’t find the rigs/armatures.
