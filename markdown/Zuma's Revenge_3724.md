I've unpacked main.pak, but it looks like all files inside encrypted.

It's all great and very helpful, so thanks again, but would be more comfortable if you say some words about how does it work.

Coz I need change data without that script, I mean manually by hEditor. I've found to xor content but next is bit difficult, where to determine data offset and size

Зачем все усложнять, распакуй main.pak этим скриптом, сделай с файлами что хочешь и запакуй обратно с помощью poppak.exe
