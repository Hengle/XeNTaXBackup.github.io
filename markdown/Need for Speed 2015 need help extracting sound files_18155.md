- Post Title: Need for Speed 2015: need help extracting sound files

Hello guys, this is my first post here, and I'm delighted to join this forum.

My concern is NFS 2015, and it's sound files
I wanted to exctract them and then just have them as .wav or .mp3 files. 
There are 2 sound files(including .toc and .sb files). the chunksaudio and chunksaudiostream

Basically what i've experimented with is some script written by a guy(in QuickBMS)(frostbite.bms script)
Thing is, in the command prompt, it tells me that there are many things in .dat files
but when i go to the output folder, i get shitload of .ttf and small amount of .dat files.
How can i fix this or is there anything more to be done with these? 
Thank you

That script is not good unfortunately, because it does not extract everything, pretty much incomplete.
BUT, if you would have made a tiny bit of research you would have found absolutely everything you need.
Just keep in mind that regardless of the name of the game, they all use same Frostbite engine so the steps are the same for what ever you need to do.
I am not able to help more at the moment, but seriously you will find everything what you need in the following places:

Please next time do a better research, there's a reason why so many gave up on helping, everything is available, regardless of the game is mentioned all Frostbite engine games work the same.
And if that doesn't help, look again, the answers are in the forum.
There's a reason why I gave you all those three links. In order to gain access for audio, you need to EXTRACT WHOLE GAME DATA.
Then you do this step.

good luck

I am also looking for a way to extract the files, most of those tools aren't working with NFS 2015 as far as I see, plus some download links are not even working.

Edit: I just found a very useful tool at [https://frostytoolsuite.com/](https://frostytoolsuite.com/) , it's working great so far and I got a few audios out already. Leaving this in case someone else ever needs help to extract the audio files.

That's because all of it has become obsolete, what you need is: [https://github.com/NicknineTheEagle/Frostbite-Scripts](https://github.com/NicknineTheEagle/Frostbite-Scripts)
Then you you'll get every single audio or what ever is your looking for intact, no other hassle.

Does it also extract localized voicelines from games like Need for Speed: Payback?
It's been years since i'm interested into getting police's chatters!
Thank you so much!

It extracts every single audio/sound/voice/music what ever, in each individual assets as it was rendered originally by the developers, including all of the videos, from all supported games mentioned on the page.

I hope so, because when i used this very script with Battlefield 3, it has ripped everything but the localized voicelines (for example: campaign dialog or multiplayer announcer...)
Anyway, i tried to perform the dump with NFS: Payback but when i compile it displays me an error:

```
  File "D:\user\Desktop\Frostbite-Scripts-master\frostbite3\dumper.py", line 7, in <module>
    import payload
  File "D:\alisu\Desktop\Frostbite-Scripts-master\frostbite3\payload.py", line 8, in <module>
    liblz4 = ctypes.cdll.LoadLibrary(r"..\thirdparty\liblz4")
  File "C:\Python27\lib\ctypes\__init__.py", line 443, in LoadLibrary
    return self._dlltype(name)
  File "C:\Python27\lib\ctypes\__init__.py", line 365, in __init__
    self._handle = _dlopen(self._name, mode)
WindowsError: [Error 193] %1 isn't a valid Win32 application.

```

Can you please help me out?
Thank you a lot!

What are you talking about, what compile what error, your using wrong python version, it clearly states you need 64-bit.

NFS 2015 runs on frostbite 3, Battlefield 3 on Frostbite 2. 

I suggest you to use an appriate script like this one : [https://mega.nz/file/a59XzQjJ#s5DKhVMc2 ... SCW0LJVCnU](https://mega.nz/file/a59XzQjJ#s5DKhVMc2igTg6JT17SblyEAbGXS3y6KCSCW0LJVCnU)

Please do me a favor and remove that link, that's not a appropriate script in any way to extract the game, you need the one below, do not mislead people to obsolete, old, broken, incomplete or wrong scripts.
Audio is fully supported too, every single asset is extracted in their original unmodified/unconverted form, every single format, every single sound fx, voices, you name it.
The old script in your link converts and destroys original audio data, while vital information for the audios are removed, you need the foobar2000/vgmstream combo in order to perform accurate play/convert on the audio assets.

You can ONLY dump what your game has, if you do not have that specific localization in your game, there's nothing to extract, and the following link is for extraction, avoid anything else as a python script for extracting Frostbite Engine games at ALL costs, trust me, not only their obsolete, also incomplete and/or wrong:

I've already used this script for Battlefield 4,and the extraction went well, I've got all audio files from all different localizations, but the audio quality is pretty nasty, is there something i can do to improve it?
Thanks a lot!

Nope, i will not remove the link. The one i provided worked perfectly for me, i get over 56 GB of wav files (including all the different langages) and the sounds aren't broken, cutted or in bad quality. You don't even need foobar2000/vgmstream for it. 
It's just a suggestion, if he isn't satisfied then he should use something else and the story ends here.
