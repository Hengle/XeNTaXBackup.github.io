Hello, I'm looking for someone who can help me and the sc community out by creating a plugin with blender or some type of tool that allow us to open the character models, edit, and export them for soul calibur 2 on gamecube, ps2, and xbox.

I have attached a zip file with all the file information that we found.  here in this mediafire

Could not use all vertices because the skinner wouldn't finish then.

Have you tried link weapon file. in blender script folder? Character models mostly use skinned meshes so it won't work properly.
Most weapon models are static meshes so use the bow object in links weapon.vmg

Ok, looks a little bit strange but you can separate it into sword, shield, etc. So that's a good start:

Ok so what should do about my model situation then?Depends on your skills. You could improve/extend the python script.
Or you could wait for Durik.
