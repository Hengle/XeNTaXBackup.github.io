I have come across an odd file format called VAS - particularly for a multiplatform title called ESPN International Winter Sports 2002. The game's music is in a large VAS file - most likely containing the individual music files. Despite using utilities that are supposed to extract/view VAS files... I was unable to extract anything from it.

If anyone's interested in taking a look at these, I've included a download link for the IWS2002 VAS. Thanks for reading.
