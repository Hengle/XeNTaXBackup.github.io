- Post Title: iDance character .dcz file

Could anyone take a look at this iDance character model here. 
I tried in 3D/2D models forum, 2 week after but still no respone. So I try it here to see if I got any luck

Someone said it was a zlib/lwz compressed files, I have no idea! 

Thanks!

doesn't look like zlib or lzw.
Maybe it's also encrypted?
