I can see from the game's pac file,The format of this game model is mdl, the texture is btx, and the sound is acbawb. I do n’t know how to convert mdl and btx files.

Sample pac file：[https://drive.google.com/file/d/17LiWpd ... sp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17LiWpdp78VbCntEuFjrvXdAsLL54ZQuE/view?usp=sharing)

Sample btx file：[https://drive.google.com/file/d/1EBJEjS ... sp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1EBJEjSvpNd8J3lUb8w1K6t-KPmbAiXsc/view?usp=sharing)

Model data is in "c001_res.pac". The format doesn't look so hard. Just loaded the vertices/indices for starters. I might release a proper tool when I have the time.
