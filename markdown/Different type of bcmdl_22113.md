- Post Title: Different type of bcmdl

I was looking for 3d models in a game, and i found a bcmdl file different from most others. This is a fountain from a map. I tried to open it with "Ohana3DS" but it gave "Unsupported file format!", so I tried to decompress it, but it also didn't work. I looked inside the file, but it looked just like the others.

File:
[https://www.mediafire.com/file/2ck9h5wk ... bcmdl/file](https://www.mediafire.com/file/2ck9h5wkubtg3hp/217_101.bcmdl/file)


That's what it looks like (screenshot of the game).
