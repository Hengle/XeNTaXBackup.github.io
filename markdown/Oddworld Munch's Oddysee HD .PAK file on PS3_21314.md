- Post Title: Oddworld Munch's Oddysee HD .PAK file on PS3

Greetings! I was curious to ask how the .PAK file was encrypted for the Playstation 3 version of Oddworld Munch's Oddysee HD. It has a lot of cool models I would love to port over to Garry's Mod, however, I can't figure out how to even extract them from this archive..



I uploaded the sample here:

*bump* Does anyone happen to know? From what I know .PAK's were also on Uncharted games for the PS3 and even The Last of Us.

The attached QuickBMS script should extract that .pak archive.

Everything seems to be working fine, however the textures are in .PS3 format.. I assumed it's just a file with a different extension but same header, however this doesn't seem to be the case.. Have you ever ran into these before?

I uploaded some sample files here: [https://mega.nz/#!VQQzFKSS!8FrAhV28-mU0 ... 2W_LkaSpJU](https://mega.nz/#!VQQzFKSS!8FrAhV28-mU0KrLj89d7EF4ILhwneaXls2W_LkaSpJU)

All your samples are in dxt5 pixel format.
