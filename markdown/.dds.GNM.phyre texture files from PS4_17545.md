what is the game name?
PS4 = gnf format
Noesis has native support for PS4 gnf and so far is the only way i know to open them.
for that you will need to build a gnf header for the image data in the phyre file, 
you should be able to do this easily by modifying chrrox's bms script here

i don't know much else than this about PS4, i may mess around with this later, but no promises.

*.phyre files are a container (RYHP>PHYR) that stores various data formats and that is where the similarities end.
"Final Fantasy XII ZA PC" is a different game on a different platform and has no relevance to "Super Robot Taisen OG - The Moon Dwellers [PS4]".
