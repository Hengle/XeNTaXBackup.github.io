- Post Title: Little Nightmares 2 modding.

Anyone have any info on how to create mods .pak for this game, i did for Little Nightmares 1 and for no rigged models i was able to create mods without problems, still struggling to modify rigged models, but for the second one, (Little nightmares 2), is driving me crazy and the models still intact, is like the .pak is not working. Please if anyone have information or know about a specific forum that someone can help me, i'll be thankful.

Thanks in advance. Greetings.
