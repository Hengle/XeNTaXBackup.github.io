- Post Title: unpack Naruto shippuden ultimate storm 4 help! (.xfbin)

[https://github.com/wmltogether/CriPakTools/releases](https://github.com/wmltogether/CriPakTools/releases)
I use this software Get the *.xfbin format file by decompressing the *.cpk.The extracted *.xfbin has an error in noesisv.(Maybe it's encryptedï¼ŒBut the nsus3 format of.Xfbin can be decrypted)
There are many tutorials about extracting nuns3 on youtube, but there is no tutorial to extract Nuns4. Does that mean that it can not be extracted?
