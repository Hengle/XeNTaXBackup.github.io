- Post Title: King of Kings 3 - LPQ files

Hello everyone guys. Very urgent! There is a closed MMORPG game. She has game resource files packed. They are just what I need. According to my analysis, this is crc32. File format *.lpq
This game has several executable files. One of which is a debug file. I have already analyzed it and everything is written there line by line, what is responsible for what. But, given that I donâ€™t understand this, this information is not enough for me. I want to get game resources from there: textures, models, maps, etc. I very much ask the author of this channel to unsubscribe to me in a personal. But the work is not difficult. Since there is a debug file. The client will throw a link in a personal. Thank you.
