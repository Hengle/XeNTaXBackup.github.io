Can you give us a client installer? Because you can get RSA key only from running application (They're in memory).

Good afternoon gentlemen!

Suddenly in this game texture structure adopt unusual format...
I was completely powerless in the unraveling of the new structure. Perhaps We will be able together to find a solution to this problem?
For example I post the archive containing a set textures of some tank:
[http://www.mediafire.com/download/biev3 ... exture.rar](http://www.mediafire.com/download/biev3f7gqau0ii4/AW_texture.rar)
Maybe someone else has already met with a similar case.

This is the new texture format for Cryengine games.  There is a tool to convert these back into the .dds files that use mipmaps instead of the current format here:

It seems like either NA and RU PTS have changed their encryption. Only RU OBT client is working now.

I am new to DDS file formats and I was trying to get into the Armored Warfare dds.6 and dds.7 files but not able to.
I tried the file link and got this back. 

E:\cap>DDSUnsplit m1a1_treads_d.dds.6 m1a1_treads_d.dds
m1a1_treads_d.dds.6 doesn't appear to be a split DDS file (m1a1_treads_d.dds.6.0 wasn't found)

What am i doing wrong?

You'll need all dds mip-maps from 0 to 7 for successfully unsplit.
Unpack both SD and HD textures, put exe and bat inside folder you need to convert, then run bat.
All subfolders is also processed by this method, so if you run UnsplitAllDDS.bat from main folder where's you extracted game files it's takes long enough to unsplit them all. Also same amount of disk space is required (as for splitted dds), but then you can delete old dds.0-7.

Thank you. 

I will try that;but from i remember of the .pak files the files are all .6 and .7 and I am not seeing the 0 - 5 files. 
Off hand do remember where the 0 - 5 files are located?

I am specifically going after the M1a1 maps.

textures-0000.pak - SD-textures 0-5.
textures_hi-0000.pak - HD-textures 6-7.
Good way to detect which .pak contains textures you need is search for files with texture name inside, Total Commander can do this job.
I found text "m1a1_hull_damaged_d" in textures-0012.pak and textures_hi-0018.pak 

If you convert models with cgf-converter, is good to use switch -objectdir "Q:\!_AW\gamezero" where "Q:\!_AW\gamezero" is your path to extracted game files (with folders "objects" and "textures" inside), this way you'll get correct path to textures inside .mtl-files.
I set cgf-converter.exe as default application for open .cgf, .cga and .chr files, but for adding command line parameter I have to edit windows registry and replace all "D:\Programs\CryEngine\cgf-converter.exe" "%1" with "D:\Programs\CryEngine\cgf-converter.exe" "%1" -objectdir "Q:\!_AW\gamezero" (your paths is differs of course).
After you convert all .cgf, .cga and .chr files in model folder, you'll need to select all materials (by mask *_mtl.mtl), right click selected and open in Notepad++ - this editor can replace text in multiple opened files at once (and folders, but I not test it).
Replace in all opened .mtl files "d 0.0000" to "d 1.0000" for making objects visible (it's transparency parameter).
Then replace (with "regular expressions" checked) "Kd (\d.*$)" by "Kd 1 1 1" for making diffuse colors white.
Also you can replace "diffuse" texture with "decal" texture by replacing "_d.dds" with "_sm.dds" because diffuse textures in game are just masks for shader, but "decal" texture contains scratches and labels:

I was able to get the objects working and now working on the material corrections. 

Replace in all opened .mtl files "d 0.0000" to "d 1.0000" for making objects visible (it's transparency parameter).
Then replace (with "regular expressions" checked) "Kd (\d.*$)" by "Kd 1 1 1" for making diffuse colors white.
Also you can replace "diffuse" texture with "decal" texture by replacing "_d.dds" with "_sm.dds" because diffuse textures in game are just masks for shader, but "decal" texture 

I have the notepad ++ install but ran out of time. 
Hope to be able to do it tonight.

Question is a cfg file that will combine the parts and align them correctly. 
I have done something like that with MechWarrior online and you could locate the cfg file that has the locations and align them correctly into Blender. 

Also if so where is the AW cfg located; specifically the M1a1.

M1A1 appears to be under "objects\vehicles\mbt\m1a1".  

And yes, the tanks (much like MWO files) have a .cdf file which specified all the parts that belong on a tank and their positions.  They are stored in .cdf files, which are just xml files that have positional and rotational info.  For example, the "m1a1_hc--m1a1_hc.cdf" file has positional information like this:

<Attachment Type="CA_BONE" AName="bag01" Rotation="1,0,0,0" Position="1.5672634,-0.33574528,2.1758029" BoneName="bag01" Binding="objects/vehicles/mbt/m1a1/m1a1_bag01_turret_m1a1.cgf" PA_PendulumType="2" PA_FPS="30" PA_MaxAngle="4.99997" PA_HRotation="0" PA_Mass="5" PA_Gravity="9.8000002" PA_Damping="40" PA_Stiffness="5" PA_SimulationAxis="0,0,-0.30000001" Flags="0"/>

I made a powershell script for MWO (mech-importer.ps1) that can take this info and import it into Blender in the right position (as well as set the materials properly).  That could be modified pretty easily for AW files, since it's basically doing the same stuff.

something strange with the .dds.# files. 
_d file is showing Red is this normal? the other files are working fine.

Those files contains only mask for game shader in Blue color channel of map, maybe for camo or metallic gloss.
_sm files is looks better if placed to diffuse as I did.

Update: for tracks _d Blue channel is white, but Red channel contains Gloss map (very likely), and Transparency (Opacity) map is present in Alpha channel.

i checked the resources and textures.

I found 2 .cdf files, but they seemed to be bag/antenna or just bag related info.  It has the transpose info in it.  It's possible that the turret, treads, etc are set to the relatively right position, but not positive.  I need to investigate.  

Cryengine files are pretty complicated, so it takes a lot of digging around.  Dozens and dozens of files, all placed in weird locations.  It's a pain.

Don't mean to hi-jack this thread but i'm a total newb at this stuff. I was hoping to scrape the data for 2 things, possibly higher resolution minimaps & scrape for tank data (i.e. get the stats into a db or a json file or some such). Any guidance will be greatly helpful!

Tank data is probably stored in xml or cdf files.  Check in the respective Objects\Vehicles\<vehicle name> directory for those types of files.  They'll be text, not binary.

The minimaps... not sure where those will be.  I'll dig around and see what I can find.  Do you have map names?  Even generic names will help me search.

In your AW directory (mine is E:\MyGames\Armored Warfare MyCom Beta), there will be a gamesdk sub.  All the .pak files are in there.

Copy them to a separate directory and extract using 7zip.  Do NOT extract them into the original game directory.

Gah so simple thanks. Yea I'm not seeing any xml or cdf files that store that sort of info, wonder if it's in the dat file or similar. Thanks for the info again.

I set cgf-converter.exe as default application for open .cgf, .cga and .chr files, but for adding command line parameter I have to edit windows registry and replace all "D:\Programs\CryEngine\cgf-converter.exe" "%1" with "D:\Programs\CryEngine\cgf-converter.exe" "%1" -objectdir "Q:\!_AW\gamezero" (your paths is differs of course).
After you convert all .cgf, .cga and .chr files in model folder, you'll need to select all materials (by mask *_mtl.mtl), right click selected and open in Notepad++ - this editor can replace text in multiple opened files at once (and folders, but I not test it).
Replace in all opened .mtl files "d 0.0000" to "d 1.0000" for making objects visible (it's transparency parameter).
Then replace (with "regular expressions" checked) "Kd (\d.*$)" by "Kd 1 1 1" for making diffuse colors white.
Also you can replace "diffuse" texture with "decal" texture by replacing "_d.dds" with "_sm.dds" because diffuse textures in game are just masks for shader, but "decal" texture contains scratches and labels:

(white materials slightly toned on this pic in attempt to recreate "jungle" camo from game)

I followed your post and I can convert and open textures fine, but how do you find a hull mesh of anyone tank?
I have extracted all the resources packs but I can find for any tank a hull mesh.. for example in resources-0006\objects\vehicles\afv\amx-10p there are amx-10p_hull.mtl and amx-10p_hull_damaged.mtl but there is no amx-10p_hull.cgf or similar..

Can you explain where exactly are hull meshes and what m I doing wrong?

Thanks

EDIT: I figured it out, the meshes for the hulls for any given tank are with .cga extention which is also opened by cgf-converter.

EDIT: Can you confirm that you can open amx-10p_hull_ddn.dds ? I can open any dds related to amx10p but this one does not show anything yet its 2.66MB ?

Also here's .chr files for tracks and suspension.

_ddn.dds are compressed with 3Dc method, instead of common DXT1-5. SAP Visual Enterprise Author (ex Deep Exploration) can open and convert them, 3ds max should too, XnView doesn't.

Tank data is probably stored in xml or cdf files.  Check in the respective Objects\Vehicles\<vehicle name> directory for those types of files.  They'll be text, not binary.

The minimaps... not sure where those will be.  I'll dig around and see what I can find.  Do you have map names?  Even generic names will help me search.
All this info is stored in gamedata.dat which is secure [SFFS container](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=21&t=2084), you can see it's content example in [old gamedata.pak](https://yadi.sk/d/ocKvUnstmmd8D) from alpha-version of game.
For unpacking gamedata.dat you can try [this tool](https://yadi.sk/d/vIKFQ9e5kTxyx), archive is passworded (pass: aw) from antiviruses, but I tested all files with virustotal - nothing really suspicious inside, but there's no any warranty.

All info and links is taken from [russian forum](http://www.koreanrandom.com/forum/topic/27225-%D1%80%D0%B0%D1%81%D0%BF%D0%B0%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%BA%D0%B0-%D0%BA%D0%BB%D0%B8%D0%B5%D0%BD%D1%82%D0%B0-armored-warfare/).

In the Armored Warfare there is *.pak extension file. I can open these files with the PakDecrypt_aw_ru.exe application and i can make *.zip form *.pak file. After i edited the *.zip file how can i convert back to *.pak the file again?
