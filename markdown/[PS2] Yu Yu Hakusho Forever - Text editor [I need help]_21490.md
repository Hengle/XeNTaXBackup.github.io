- Post Title: [PS2] Yu Yu Hakusho Forever - Text editor [I need help]

I am interested in translating this game, but I have had several problems with the format of the text files:

- I need to know how to edit the dialogs and menus without character limit.

- I need to know if it is possible to edit the font to support characters with tiles (spanish).

- There are texts in the menus that I am not sure if they are texts or images.

For now what I have found out about this format is that the beginning of the file seems to contain a table with the font, then there is a content that seems "dump" but I imagine they are pointers or something (sorry for my poor explanation) and Finally there is the text I want to edit.


I attached an example file, at offset 86655 is the word "OK" and at offset 86661 the word "BACK" that I have managed to edit.
