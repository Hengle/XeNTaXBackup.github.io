- Post Title: Need help extracting audio from Deadpool the Video Game

I really want to access the audio that contains all the dialogue/lines for the game.

I tried using umodel and batch extractor to export all sounds but it didn't extract the lines. I think they may be in the files named "SoundEvents_Dialog.xxx" "DSoundEvents_Dialog_p" or "DialogCharacters_p" but umodel doesn't open it.

Any program or method that would work? Help would be appreciated!

It's an Unreal Engine 3 game I believe, you're best off using Gildor's UPK decompressor and extractor.
