- Post Title: Metal gear Solid 3 file extraction (getting soemwhere!!)

I am not going to post a PART file JUST YET as I would rather know if anyone has any interest in this game whatsoever.
Its a PS2 game (a WHOLE new ball game lol).
I know that Turfster is busy with Solidus (the tool for MGS2 PC) so i dont really think he will want to try this.
Of course if ANYONE (even Turfster) is interested in this in ANY WAY then PLEASE post here.
i will put up a part file soon enough.
Its just that each .DAT file is about 500 meg or above, I know that if there was a tool to EXTRACT these little archieves from it (if there ARE any that is) then il be able to attach them MUCH easier, if not I can EVEN put them on Megaupload or something of that sort.

PLEASE someone SUPPORT this request.
I know its asking a lot but then again whats the meaning of Programming if it isnt to find a Barrier and Calculate your way through it.
That in MY opinion/KNOWLEGE of Programming is the KEY to a Great programmer, one who wishes to overcome the obsticle.
Thankyou

I know it may be a little EARLY for this but I thought it would be ok to BUMP this topic.
Well its not JUST that another thing is that I have used filecutter to cut the file down for you.
This way anyone can see the file, as i am unsure how many of you actually OWN this game like me.
The following attached file is from STAGE.DAT on the MGS3 PS2 DVD.
I am asking here as I have looked ENDLESSLY at this file and the others 
from the game, i am unable to make ANYTHING from it, I cant even figure out the GRAIS of the file, its just random bytes as far as I can see, I have only once or 2x been able to make asingle word out, things like DAR, QAR and XSI(the program used to MAKE the game).
Please if someone can make any progress with this then i might be able to continue on into something.

YES!!!      I have a huge huge interest to get the character models, textures, and voice work from this game. And animations, if possible.

But that doesn't mean I have any knowledge of any sort of how to do it (if thats what you meant by interest).  It's really a different format than MGS2? That's interesting....  Well maybe we can hack into it one day. You know, give it three years and we'll see.     Heh, but yeah, I guess don't hold your breath, but the main point is NEVER GIVE UP on this because you may never know!    

That would really be great if anyone is willing to give it a look at some point.  As he says, if you really want to sharpen your hacking skillz, this is really a challenge to take on. And unlike the support yet seen on here, I know there would be MANY fans who would appreciate this. Probably more than for PC Substance because not many actually own the PC version - STILL I REALLY appreciate the work being done in that thread (thank you Turfster!).

I'm The Dying Informant, and I approve this thread.

he he.
Been waintg for you  to post here actually.
Well last night me and another Certain Xentax figure looked into the MGS3 Stage.dat.
We discovered that its encrypted (NO surprise there eh), but were tryignt o find our way around it.
I managed to extract 2 files from CODEC.DAT but so far i have NO IDEA what they are.
Working Hard on any type of Audio Extraction from BGM.DAT, it seems asthough they may be using their OWN Audio Format (unless its some WHACKED encryption again).
Well i just installed Visual Studio 6.0 so that I can give my good friend a helping hand, I want to improve a few tihngs in the Program before its next release, tho I have no idea WHEN that'l be but were workign hard ot try and make it support MGS3 files or any sort, so far the scanner is picking up nothing from the files.
Tho so far i have only tested BGM.DAT and CODEC.DAT, its hard to upload the files from this game as their all liek 1 GIG and over.

after much hard work me and Strobe mangaged to EXTRACT Audio from MGS3 VOX.DAT.
I ownt take really ANY of the credit as 60% was strobe, I still need to find out a few more things before i can do much with the tool.

We have spoken about the release of the tool, as its currently and add on to His tool for MULTIPLE games, so until we are able to crack STAGE.DAT or BGM.DAT were not going to release the tool here.

Tho i hope that in the future we can export the info to a seperate tool just for MGS3.
Much like Turfster did with MGS3 we/I would like to do with this tool.
Eva, is that a good name?
anyways here is a bit of extrcted SPEACH.
I believe its major tom near the start of the games 1st section.
http://www.megaupload.com/?d=IPB0OVV8
Sorry its too big to upload here, not to mention its not a supported file type lol

UPDATE:
I seem to be the ONLY person who actually cares abotut his game and its file.
Oh well it doesnt matter.
Ok now I have some PROOF of how the games models and stuff were made.
Sound mixing and stuff aswell.
Here look at this i hope it helps.


these are in SOFTIMAGE XSI, i believe it was also used for MGS2 and the twin snakes.

Wha.. sory i dont understand.
But yeah i actually forgot to post the link to the Softimage Website.
Realyl should have.
Tho i havent really gotten very far at all with this game, its some some WHACKED encryption method, im pretty sure there even using their OWN formats for everything, well except VAG audio.

I mean that i hope it helps get SOMEONE interested in this topic, someone else who may be tryingt o do the same thing.
As I know that the Dying Informant wants to do soemthing with MGS3, but im not sure EXACTLY what she wants from it.
So im currently unsure on exactly what i should work on with this tool.

So far im DEFFINATLY (if i can crack it propperly) goingt o do the following

- Speach extraction (well this is like 70% done just needs a bit of a fixer upper)

- Textures (Both character,background and screens ie: titlescreen ect.

- 3D model extraction

- Music extraction

- Animations

- MOVIE extraction (I have managed to view a few bits and have detected more, but i only managed to find 4 seconds worth lol, ut i know its from a 5 minute cutscene)

Oh YAY! I really wanted the voice work too!     

I don't have a need for it right NOW, but I can say, PSound has very limited ability to extract from MGS3 - MOST if not ALL files need fixing first, alot are even cut off, and some stuff I have been able to just record from my video capture card, but it doesn't work out too well, as all through all MGS3 there are ALWAYS background sounds in the codec and ofcourse cutscenes (and music). If I could get some PURE dialog, that would be awesome. Keep me posted. But I dont think I have much free space right now, so I won't be grabbing the audio just yet. I wanna focus on models and textures right now. But I'm really glad you have some audio pulled out!

Too bad the other stuff is MUCH HARDER to access? they are very very clever with encrypting MGS. They just don't want anyone to have access to it.

Well, ever since you totally TEASED me with those very Big Boss model images there, I have been hoping to get that model for real, lol. Why didn't I clue into the Japanese text all over the image?    

But who knows, it may be more of a headacke to understand than the MGS2 models, AND we don't even have ALL of them as I explained in that MGS2 topic.

Sounds great though! Keep me posted. Just don't respond too MUCH on your own. I don't know if they'd ban you for that or lock the topic. hehehe.

Actualy if it was on MY PC itd be in JAP anyways lol.
Its only some stuff by the programmer jsut exaplaining the advantage of that particular feature in XSI.
yeah there for TEASING lol, tho also to explain my point.
But the MGS3 models are most likely NOT same as MGS2 sorry.
but if they are ul be 1st on my list to know lol.

Seems to me you'd need to reverse engineer the executable to be able to see what encryption they use for the stage.dat. This Russian named Sly, who' s lurking these boards might be of help to you. With just the snippets you uploaded there's not much to go on.

sly huh.Hmmm.
Never heard of him, but il look into it soon as i finish this message.
Yeah id like to UPLOAD the FULL file btu its damn near 800 MEG if not a GIG and thatl take a while.
I guess I can always make a torrent for that 1 file and others u lot may need.
(thats allowed right?, cos its MY file that IM sharing cos I purchased it, its just easier ot share through that).

And btw, Lionheart, if you are able to extract from Vox.dat on MGS3, does that mean its possible to also do so for MGS2? That can be an upgrade you can help with for Solidus    .

I can TRY and use UVAG to extract the audio form VOX.DAT yes.
I dont see why not, were you able to PLAY the last file i put up?
Its Sony VAG audio.
Im using Vistual Studio Now, ad with some Helping tips from Strobe, i seem to be understanding MORE AND MORE when it comes to files.
You may need to UPLOAD the VOX.DAT for me tho, as i dont have it.

I now understand A LOT more Hex and file hackign then i did when I 1ST started this Topic but still I cant seem to get past this CRAZY ASS encryption method.

I have even looked at the ELF files that CAME in the games folder.

- ELF is PS2 format for .EXE

But even after looking at the ELF fiels i STILL have NO IDEA how the Encryption for the STAGE.DAT file works.
IF ANYONE can PLEASE look at the .ELF files and figure out how to CRACK the Encryption (Reverse Engineering i Hear) then il or soemone else wil be abelt o make a tool, but we cant get NOTHING from the file till then i dont think.

hi, been following bot mgs 2 and 3 topics, kinda interesting .

actually, been trying to extract both fmv/animation and audio from those files and only succeeded slightly on movie.dat. as u well know that the animation is only 1-5secs when open. however if u use the nova extractor and change the size of that particular file larger, then u`ll get the whole mix-up animation. however the sound is of course - no audio. but when checked through mfaudio, evidently there's static as well "unclear" noise-voice.

so been thinking if u might be able to point out how to extract the sound. thanx in advance.

Well currently for the MOVIE.DAT i have been UNABLE to extract ANYTHING from it lol.
But the VOX.DAT I used UVAG in Jeader and got some stuff from it.

Yes I have been there, Its a good site actually lol.
Well I wondered for a while where their Clips came from, but im positive its not from hacking the DVD, I think they just used a DVD recorder to record the PS2 game in action.
btw:its nto on PS

Well I went out and Bought MGS3 Subsistance about 15 minutes ago, so Im going to try and see if there are any differences between the DATS or not.
Of course it still seems to be ENCRYPTED.

I ra it through STUNS and got SOMETHING, but its hard to tell QUITE what it is, though the STUNS OUTPUT doesnt seem to be compressed or encrypted, i found several BG.OFE2201 and BGM.L1U2.
But im not sure QUITE what they mean as of now.
I sent some files to turfster to see if HE could make anything out of thme or not.

maybe, i`ll give it a try again by 2nite. thanx

btw, bgm? is it soundtrack files?

BGM is BackGround Music yes.
Though it would be easier to simply get the ORIGINAL SOUNDTRACK like so many of us did lol.
Its really good.
Well u dont have STUNS so maybe THATS why u cant get fa with MGS.
STUNS is attached in the twin snakes TOPIC check there for it.
If u need help in using it then contact me via MSN

well i`ve used stun.exe file previously and uses on my extracted mov.mpg which is 700mb above. but all i can do is just wait as it took a long time to do it's stuff. and furthermore, i have no idea where it place the those files to.

and also, u uses that file on which mgs3 file type? just a question.

uses gigahertz fmv tool manage to extract those fmvs plus certain animation, and this fmv are divided properly. but the only thing is the image can be distorted at times, and no audio.

using virtuamoddub to load those files and check on stream reveal no audio. so a test made to load back that file as an audio, and according to the file note, it's an mpeg 1-3layer stereo 44000kbits...something 100.50khz... like that. so what does that mean, btw? of course, when compressed as a wav file reveals no sound.

.
I use it on the STAGE.DAT (though ALL the files in MS3 are .DATS except the .ELF files that are just the playstation version of an .EXE

You dont DRAG anything into the STUNS icon lol.
What you have to do is run CMD(command Promt) then find the stuns 
```
directory(ie:c:\ documents and settings\dan\desktop.
```

The once you have navigated to the correct directory u type

```
STUNS.exe - deflate STAGE.DAT
```

its ok.
Very much lokoing forward to gettign SOMETHING form MGS3 lol.
Best thing to do is to use STUNS on the file cut that I posted here in this topic.
Or of course make your own cut if you like i guess.
STUNS SHOULD make its output in your c:/documents and setting/(your current user name), It was in there when i was first using STUNS in the wrong way, THou now I use it correctly so its ok

```
- Make a new text document in the STUNS directory
- open the text document and type [b]cmd[/b] and then save and exit it.
- Change the .TXT extension to .bat.
Then u can run it easily and faster lol

alright, thanx for the tips. been trying to deflate the stage.dat, and all i got is a very long and lots of 1kb file which is around 4.11mb, but i could`nt get anything such as the bgm that u had.

i tried the file stripper from turfster to strip bgm.dat, and all i could see is rip 2 files but only 1 is available which is bitmap file which could not be opened. what's a bink file anyway?

> alright, thanx for the tips. been trying to deflate the stage.dat, and all i got is a very long and lots of 1kb file which is around 4.11mb, but i could`nt get anything such as the bgm that u had.

i tried the file stripper from turfster to strip bgm.dat, and all i could see is rip 2 files but only 1 is available which is bitmap file which could not be opened. what's a bink file anyway?
I am sure BINK is a video format lol.
Though maybe BINK is something else aswell, i just once saw a BLINK video player once.
Th STIPPER from Turfster?
Huh?
Please explain what you mean, Also can you please attach the extracted files from turfsters tool that you speak of as I have never heard of it.

Well It cant hurt to check can it.
Maybe can get soemthing USEABLE from it, I have NO IDEA what its compressed or encrypted with, though i KNOW its encrypted for a fact.

nope no info on it really.
But as you just said, it contains text for codec, It doesnt contain AUDIO at all though I know this.
What do you wan to DO with CODEC.DAT then?translate it what?
FOr translation i SUPPOSE it can simply be done with a hex editor providing the words and letters are IDENTICLE in length.
Ie: english word may be SOCK and other language translation must be EQUAL lengh and ammount of characters so SOKKU is INCORRECT and KOSO would be correct.

Pardon, I dont quiet understand what you mean there my friend.
The size of CODEC.DAT you want to know, Well tbh It doesnt really matter to me as I am not going to Extract or EDIT CODE.DAT anyways, as its a PS2 there would be no way to write the data BACK onto a disk, Then your looking at Illegal Copying and such.

The CODEC.ELF is only a few meg lol, All the .ELF files are but a few meg really.

Ahh i see.
IL take  alook in  asecond at my disk CODEC.DAT, though It makes no difference really because no one wants to EDIT codec .dat as itd be a wate of time unless you have a chipped PS2(ILLEGAL).
Or if u have a PS2 emulator, but CURRENTLY NONE WILL EVEN SUPPORT MGS3.

Hey, [CHECK THIS OUT!](http://boards.polycount.net/showflat.php?Cat=0&Number=77520&page=&fpart=1&vc=1)

Maybe that link holds the key to MGS3 extraction..... I mean they are accessing and viewing content of Final Fantasy X, which is another very popular and surely to be secure DVD. And yet, maybe not so secure?  These people may have the info we need here!

Is it too early for me to get really excited now? lol

By the way, [HERE](http://www.yaz0r.net/ffxview.php) is the direct site they are talking about.

And you will see there is a MODEL EXTRACTER there for these Final Fantasy X characters. Let's HOPE Turfster or Lionheart or any other talented hacker can look at his code and tweak it for MGS3! Unless MGS3 is a really VERY different encryption or whatever and much different to access. I really know nothing about these things.  But if we've learned anything, its that even the impossible is very possible if people want it bad enough and someone has the ability to make it so.

lol I see you have picked up my habit of Endless capitol WORDS lol.

I already used this Program and It is indeed very good.
The models in FFX and FFX2 are the same format ".fbx" the reason you need to make an ISO of those games is because the info is 100% HIDDEN, so when you look at it in anything you cant see the daya at all.
This will not work on MGS3 I dont think, BUT i DO need to make an ISO file of MGS3 and MGS3 Substance to see if there is any hidden data that might be helpful in figuring it all out.

No the Encryption in FFX adn MGS3 is very different.
I have spoken to "YAZ0R" about MGS3 but he is very busy recently and he doesnt make EXPORTERS for common programs (obj, 3DS,MAYA ect..) instead he only lets people VIEW them with his Program notthing more.

Thanks for the info anyways.
Glad to see your back again.

MGS3 don't contain any hidden data. I think models are compressed with zlib like PS2 MGS2.

Hmmm...... well I hope it can be figured out.

In any case though, don't be so discouraged about that Yazor guy. I mean, I highly respect that he doesn't want the official models to get into the hands of everyone out there. It would be a concern to me as well. But remind him that this is being used for PRIVATE use.  No one should use the models for an illegal purpose.

Even if he can't DIRECTLY help you, maybe he can atleast share some of his findings with you or Turfster, I mean, he even has the characters animations viewable right? It may very well be a totally different format than MGS3, but none the less, having such access to a PS2 DVD is very promising. Maybe some day for MGS3 it'll also be possible.

I'm still floored about MGS2 access really.    

I do feel kinda bad for game developers though.  I would totally HATE feeling like people out there, anyone, people who I don't know and don't have control over, have my characters to do what they please with.  That's why, while I don't want Konami limiting what fans are able to do with games we BOUGHT and are curious about, I am also quite serious about making sure their rights are being followed too.

Nah it turned out to have no hidden data after all anyways.

What makes you think that the MGS2 PS2 models are ZLIB compressed by the way? The STAGE.DAT is encrypted and we havent been able to Decrypt it yet. lets alone even FIND the models + im the only person who has worked on MGS2 PS2 everyone else is doing MGS2 PC.
I doubt its such a common format anyways, otherwise we would have all cracked it by now.

As far as i know ALL the metal gear games are ENCRYPTED, even MGS1 for PSX which isnt very good encryption lol but still is encrypted none the less.

I wouldnt mind seeing some information to explain how you know or think there LZIB compressed inside the INACSESSABLE STAGE.DAT's, maybe il be able to learn something from it.

This link for codec.dat (~5Mb in RAR) from NTSC US MGS3 SE.  I think it contains only English language, but encoding of text is unknown
I downlaoded it and it turns out its the same as the English CODEC.DAT.

But i STILL dont understand the point behind hacking  the CODEC.DAT as it only contains text anyways, all the codec audio is in VOX.DAT.

You seem very interested in CODE.DAT im guessing its so that you can translate your text to your, own language, if oyur language uses any unicode characters then your screwed as you can simply CHANGE LANGUAGE of the text inside a hex editor no need for anything else, but Unicode characters (asian Languages) are not supported neither is french and german(because they have Hyphons and little signs that are not in the english alphabet).

Even IF you could change the informaiton correctly it wont matter as you will still need to write the data BACK ONTO a PS2 disk, which would require a MOD CHIPPED PS2 which btw IS illegal as far as i know.
No PS2 emulators support MGS3 yet, and they dont look like there gonna for a long time now so there goes your chances of playing it on your PC eh.

So can you please explain why you want acess to CODEC.DAT so much as i just CANNOT think of a reason.

If you load elf from mgs2 in hex editor, you see that used inflate library (v1.2.1). Inflate is part of zlib, that library very portable  
Why KONAMI add this library to projec? May be for compress/decompress saves on memory card, may be for compressed stage.dat for fast reading... 

About CODE.DAT... Yes, I want translate  
When I open MGS2 codec.dat in hex-editor, I see text! But when I open MGS3 codec.dat in hex-editor I DON'T SEE text!!! That is my problem 

Its NORMAL that  I did not see any text in MGS3 codec.dat, except some words like "radiotest" and "PROFILE"???

 hmmm.
IL look into this now then.
But on the other hand WHY work on the PS2 version when we have the PC versions files? The PS2 version isnt reallyt anything different apart from maybe always working wheras PC depends on harware configurations.

Hm once again I still think it makes more sense to work on MGS2PC's CODEC.DAT, Or dont you own the PC one? If not then that makes PERFECT sense.
But either way you would need to COPY the disk and then have a MOD for your PS2 to play it.
Btw: Your english seems to be pretty good here and I assume that the game isnt Dubed in Ukraine? She CODEC text is only for the pure sake of it, I never actually used it even in the Japanese version I still only listened ot the speach.[/quote]

One more argument in favour of zlib. You try compress stage.dat (with any archiver)? You see a low compress ratio for archive... a think becouse stage.dat already compressed. Compare uncompressed PC stage.dat folder (mgs2) with PS2 stage.dat... We have 4000Mb vs. 600 Mb. I dont think that dds-texture at 5 times greater(large) that tim2 

My english seems to be pretty good here??? Probably you joke 
Yes, MGS3 isnt Dubed in Ukraine. I think its never happen 
So I want to get text from MGS3 codec.dat (in other files like movie.dat text has simple ASCI encoding), then translate with PC-translator, then transliterate into latin characters, and back to the game - via Network Adapter + HDD or DVD-R to console. That is my plan  Its illegal? Not if I dont resale this DVD-R copy.

Yes of course STAGE.DAT is compressed, Its also ENCRYPTED in MGS2, MGS2S and MGS3.

I wasnt joking, so far your english is pretty good.
Yes copying a PS2 game even for yourself Counts as illegal, I dont really understand the details But it does, Also ud need a MODDED PS2 to play the DVD R anyways PS2 mods are illegal aswell lol, as they TAMPER or replace the SONY guarenteed hardware.
The 1 file that im interested in is STAGE.DAT, nothing else really, Once thats done il move onto the others as by then il understand the method used to COMPRESS and ENCRYPT the files.

I don't want to burst anyone's bubble but did you know PSound works with this game to extract sounds. 

P.s. Is their any tutorials to show what data goes with what file when extracting using a hex editor, I think I may have found the model files names for Metal Gear Solid for the PSX but cannot find the data that matches the files.

Erm yes i did know that.
Ive used it myself..
BUt on MGS3 it makes so many sounds sound kinda strange and stuff also it doesnt exactly do a great job on this game..
But tbh.. i own the OST.. i dont want the sounds from the MGS games i own the osts to them all.. I wanted the models and textures instead.

Also use MR MOUSE Ultimate Guide to Hex editing.
everythings in there, thats where most of us learnt our stuff, though i personally havent Hexed in at least 6 months, But unless its a format WE KNOW then its still hard, there are so many variations of headers and stuff that some simple formats like a TGA can be edited so u dont even know it, but still be read the same way.

I was looking at the Demo.DAT file from a Metal Gear Solid 3 PS2 Demo (US Playstation Magazine Holiday 2004 Demo Disc), and this file which is not compressed/encrypted appears to contain some type of model data for the level (not characters though). The Demo.dat file can be extracted using the konami data tool, and decomposed into .BIN .RAW and .SUB files 
Raw files seem to contain level textures, and .BIN seem to contain the level geometry.
 The model format looks very unique and I need to took at it some more but here is what I found so far:
Each BIN file is composed out of many (thousands) subsections that have a heading that look like the following:
80 fe 08 00 * * * * * * * * * 00 00 00
This always occurs on an offset that ends in "0"
The BIN files always begin with a unique header like:
80 FE 08 00 00 00 00 00 81 01 ?? 00 01 00 00 00
Likewise the BIN files always end some where around a similar header
80 FE 08 00 A8 2A 00 00 81 02 ?? 00 01 00 00 00
Other than those two specific headers this is the headers look like this
80 FE 08 00 XX XX 00 00 01 05 28 00 01 00 00 00 
Where XX XX is a 2byteinteger that appears to begin at 00 and increases every other header though in some files it skips some numbers but it will never decrease.
There is Vertex information and Normal Mappings in each subsection along with other structures that need documenting. I am attaching a .BIN file. Can someone tell me if the DEMO.DAT file appears on full versions of the PS2 Game? Or if MTG3 for the PS2 has a demo mode where the computer plays against itself?
