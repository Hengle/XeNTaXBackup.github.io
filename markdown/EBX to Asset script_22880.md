Everything works perfectly fine, you should describe your issue step by step or provide screenshot of the error, you cant just state that and not provide some context.

And also, why create another Frostbite related thread when there are so many already.

Does that script work for getting models from NFS The Run? Would like the main character model with bones if it's possible.

There is no current support for NFSTR assets besides vehicles.
