- Post Title: call of duty 3 2006 3d model extraction/tutorial

hello everyone. unfortunately the facepunch forums has been closed and recently I posted this thread in there but now it's closed. actually the call of duty 3 is for ps2,ps3,xbox360 and I looked through the game and in details and I saw things that never was in other ww2 call of duty games specially mp40 model that never I saw in cod franchise. I searched for it but I saw only soldiers models exported by luxox008 but there is no weapon models. If there is anyway I can export and get the models out of this game , I'll be appreciate for it.
