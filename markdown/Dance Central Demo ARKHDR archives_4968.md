- Post Title: Dance Central Demo ARK/HDR archives

Hi 

Im tried extract demo game Dance Central  and inside
archives ARK / HDR ( the same like in rockband game ). Im use arktool7 because this
always extracted succesfully rockband games - this time in this game  arktool7 cant extract this
ARK (main_xbox.hdr decrypted successfully and can view files but in arktool files not listed)

Anyone can help with this or maybe available any other ark/hdr extractor ?
