I've just noticed that I have answered similar question last year
[viewtopic.php?f=35&t=22286](https://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=35&t=22286)

So the tool I've mentioned there is also working with your samples

And you can use it to edit fonts.

Well, that's an issue on your side.
Try to install .NET framework as this is C# program and it may help with this issue.

If that won't help, you can always report an issue on github

But I used this software and when I extracted the fonts,
He gives me the fonts in the PNG format. Now How am I supposed to write these letters in my own language?

You can't. But you can replace already existing characters. 
For example go to letter "À" and replace it wth letter "Ż" (this is example for polish language).

And on the end you should get similar mapping [https://i.imgur.com/8FHUb6U.png](https://i.imgur.com/8FHUb6U.png)

Then in the text file you can write word "Àaba" instead polish word "Żaba" and proper word will appear in the game.
In the samples you provided polish letters are already there, but you get the idea.
