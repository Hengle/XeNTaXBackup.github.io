- Post Title: Is it possible?

Is it possible for chroxx to code an import/export plugin for .YOBJ PS2 Models for 3D's max.
I know he has coded a plugin for .YOBJ Models of the PS3 Wrestling games.I know its possible to export .YOBJ as obj using RRexporter.But is it possible to code a plugin to export the modified model file as .YOBJ?
If this objective can be achieved,i'm ready to donate money!!!
I have attached a Batista's PS2 2010 .YOBJ Model and its .tm2 textures.
