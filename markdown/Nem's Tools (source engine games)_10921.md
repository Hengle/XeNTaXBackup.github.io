Crafty is a 3D object, material, model and file browsing utility targeted towards Half-Life modders or enthusiasts looking for a Steam Independent application for quick previews. It currently supports Half-Life 2 .bsp, .mdl, .vmf and .gl formats along with Half-Life .bsp, .mdl, .map and .rmf formats in a variety of render modes.

Features:

    View Half-Life 2 .bsp, .gl, .mdl and .vmf files.
    View Half-Life 1 .bsp, .map, .mdl and .rmf files.
    View .obj and .skp files.
    Textured, solid, x-ray, wireframe and point render modes.
    Toggle occlusion, frustum and backface culling.
    Scene freezing.
    Export all formats and materials to .obj.
    Browse and export from GCF and other package formats.
    Browse and export materials.
    Browse and export models.

Hidden Features:

Crafty is designed foremost as an object viewer, but it also contains several useful features that can be invoked externally. For example, Crafty's File System Browser, Material Browser and Model Browser can all be invoked with special command arguments. To view one or more packages in File System Browser simply use: Crafty.exe -fsb -mount [package 1] -mount [package 2] ... . To view one or more packages in Material Browser simply use: Crafty.exe -msb -mount [package 1] -mount [package 2] ... . To view one or more packages in Model Browser simply use: Crafty.exe -mb -mount [package 1] -mount [package 2] ... . For example, if you wanted to view thumbnails of the materials in source materials.gcf you would use Crafty.exe -msb -mount "source materials.gcf". If you are familiar with Windows you can also add shortcuts to these features in the system context menu.

VTFLib is a LGPL open source programming library, written by Neil Jedrzejewski and I. VTFLib provides a C and C++ API that, with a few simple functions, can open and save .vtf and .vmt files, providing access to all known features. The library functions independent of Steam, allowing third party applications to use the library without Steam present or runningi on the target system.

VTFLib includes two GPL example applications, VTFCmd and VTFEdit. VTFCmd is a C command line frontend for VTFLib that can create .vtf and .vmt files from various source formats. It is similar in functionality to Valve's vtex Source SDK utility, but offers a lot more control. VTFEdit is a C++ .NET graphical frontend for VTFLib with viewing and creation capabilities. Both VTFCmd and VTFEdit support several source image formats, including, but not limited to .bmp, .dds, .gif, .jpg, .png and .tga.

Documentation:

[VTFLib Documentation](http://www.wunderboy.org/docs/vtflib_docs/)
[VTF Image Format](http://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/VTF)

Features:

    Convert .bmp, .dds, .gif, .jpg, .png and .tga files to .vtf and .vmt files with easy access to all .vtf options.
    Convert .vtf files to .bmp, .jpg, .png and .tga files.
    Convert entire folders to and from .vtf and .vmt files.
    Convert .wad files to .vtf and .vmt files.
    Explore .bsp, .gcf, .pak, .wad and .xzp packages.
    Preview .vtf files.
    Recent file menu.

Batch Compiler is a Front End program designed to compile all your maps in the simplest and fastest way possible, batch files. The program works on Batch Compiler Specification (BCS) files which are dynamic configuration files capable of specifying almost everything in Batch Compiler, from the switches, to the way the batch file is written and what is written where. Batch Compiler comes with specification files for the current Source Tools, Zoners Tools, the old Quake Tools, HLFix, RESGen, Map Backup and many other programs. Each switch contains a brief description on what it does to help make everything easy and centralized.

Features:

    Every switch in the current Source Tools and Zoners Tools.
    A description of what each switch does.
    Automatic specification updating.
    The ability to save "Preset" files and assign them to quick launch buttons.
    The ability to associate presets with Batch Compiler.
    Specification files are written in a simple text format which can be customized and created by the user.
    A recent MAP file and recent Batch Compiler Preset (BCP) menu for quick access to everything.
    Creates and runs BAT files on the fly, also allows for the option of saving BAT files separately (for easy access and compiling without the program).
    Lots of file management options such as deleting unneeded files and copying others after and before compiling built into the specification files.
    Program can be shut down while BAT files are running so Batch Compiler uses absolutely no memory and you map gets 100% of your systems resources.
    The ability to start HL with your map as soon as compilation is complete.
    The ability to automatically open the maps log file as soon as compilation is complete.
    Checks fields to insure they are correct.
    Quick and easy setup.
    100% Free.

Nem's Mega 3D Terrain Generator is a relatively new terrain generator that takes a step in a completely different direction. Unlike traditional generators where the user must depend solely on the generators generation abilities, this generator gives its users complete 3D control over what their terrain looks like. Users start off with a flat piece of landscape, then add to it with one, or a combination of many powerful generation options. They then have several tools at their disposal to literally grab the terrain and pull it as they want it. The terrain can be saved as a .tgm file for latter use and exported to a .map file for use in any map editing programs for Quake engine based games such as Half-Life. Additionally terrain can be exported as a .t3d for use in UnrealEd or a .rmf or .vmf file for use in Hammer or any number of other supported formats.

Features:

    Full 3D control over the appearance of your terrain.
    Nine tools to help you shape your terrain.
    Fractal terrain generation via eleven unique configurable algorithms.
    Heightmap terrain generation.
    Multi level Undo, Redo and Revert.
    Four render modes: Textured, Solid, Wireframe, and Points.
    Several different styles of lightmaps.
    Lots of additional display options.
    Save your terrain as a .tgm file for latter editing.
    Exports to .vmf, .map, .rmf, .t3d, .dxf, .obj, .smf, .txt, .bmp and .jpg file formats.
    Ability to export hint brushes along with your terrain for polygon reduction in Quake engine based games.
    Texture browser.
    Simple vertex locking.
    Recent .tgm file menu.
    Quick and easy setup.
    100% Free.
