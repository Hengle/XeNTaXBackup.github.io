- Post Title: PlayStation 3 .pkg Files

I am looking for a way to decompress these .pkg files on the PlayStation 3.
You run into them when downloading from the PlayStation Network for example.
I'm including a link to content downloadable from the PSN for free.
([http://tinyurl.com/ps3pkg](http://tinyurl.com/ps3pkg)) About 4MB. Should contain at least a .p3t PS3 theme file.
I hope anyone can help me.
Thanx in advance
