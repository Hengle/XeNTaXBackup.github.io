- Post Title: Bullet girls translation

I have been working on a translation patch for bullet girls and I am at the point where I have found an "unpacker" that gets the text files out of dat.bin but it skips of the TOC. The "unpacker" is a bms script found here: [https://zenhax.com/viewtopic.php?f=12&t=12336](https://zenhax.com/viewtopic.php?f=12&t=12336) I am hoping for someone to help me make a repacker and an unpacker that also gets the TOC.
Thank you in advance!
