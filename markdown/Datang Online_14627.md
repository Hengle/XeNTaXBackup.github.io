Hi, is there anyone here familiar with this game?
I hope someone can help me open this and import it to 3dsmax.
I have tried searching for related topic and use some script but no luck.
Please take a look at the files.

for model it uses = .msh/.arp
for animation = .anaf/.aras/.ara
for the texture = .tex

wrong subforum - this is not related to archives, is it?

The msh files you uploaded are low poly:

Wow, nice work. Thank you for this. 
How about opening the mesh in noesis, is it possible?

My bad, maybe the moderator can move this. Im sorry.
I think they are using low poly models, the client is only 700mb.
Sad, I dont know how to use hex.


Maybe you can look at this tool. Its chinese.

well, a 3D project with source, but sadly it's incomplete.

I tried to compile the ModelEditor, but ArkGraphicBase.h was missing.

Then I tried the MapEditor, 3 Ark... projects are missing:

Maybe they were part of this repository: /svn/trunk/GameWork/Client
but all I get is 404:  "not found on this server".

(I'm sorry to say that I don't waste my time with incomplete projects.)

it's me again!   
Would be amazing if someone can make a plugin for this game, sadly it has no filenames after unpacking so is long task to get the mesh and match it with their texture more if them have not any sequence or correlations between hashes.
