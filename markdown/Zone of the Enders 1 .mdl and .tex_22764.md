- Post Title: Zone of the Enders 1 .mdl and .tex

I have been trying to convert the models from Zone of the Enders 1 for the PS2.

Using existing tools from years ago (mostly through the wayback machine) I have got its .pak archives extracted but have not been able to get any further.

The relevent files seem to be:
mdl - Model
mtl - Motion/Animation?
tex - Texture

None of them seem to have header or type information beyond the extentions.

There was a converter for the tex but it is no longer avaliable on the site or in the wayback machine [https://zenhax.com/viewtopic.php?t=3382](https://zenhax.com/viewtopic.php?t=3382)

Thank you in advance for any help or advice.

Thank you, I must have missed that.
That will help with the textures but not the models.
