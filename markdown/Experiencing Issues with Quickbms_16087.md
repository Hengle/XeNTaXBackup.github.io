- Post Title: Experiencing Issues with Quickbms

Hello, I am currently trying to port assets from Xenoblade Chronicles for the wii to the source engine.  I have my .iso file and I have some .pkb files that I need that I got from dolphin emulator.  The problem here though is that I cannot get the .pkb files into brres or a usable format.  I have tried a few scripts but the problem seems to be coming from somewhere else, what happens whenever I try to run one of the scripts with an iso or pkb file it gives me the same error saying "error in src\quickbms.c line 1265: myfopen ()" If anybody happens to know what the problem is or how it can be fixed please let me know.  If I need to explain more or give more information about my issue please tell me as well. Thank you in advance.
