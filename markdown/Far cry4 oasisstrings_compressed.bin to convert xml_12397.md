This is not for the "oasisstrings_compressed.bin", only for the .dat files.
FC3 tool doesn't work ([viewtopic.php?p=83467#p83467](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?p=83467#p83467)), as they changed some stuff. I already contacted the creator, but he said he'll maybe have time to modify it next year.

Now it should work with Far Cry 4 files. But it won't work with Far Cry 3 files.

I know it's been a while since this was posted (thanks to rengareng for altering the old converter to work with FC4)

Unfortunately I've noticed some issues when it reconverts. For example if you convert the OASISSTRING to xml and immediately re-convert it back without making any changes there are still some random strings which disappear in game (throwing knives label in the shop, turning off camera tagging label in the menu system, etc). There's not too many of these, but the menu ones are bad since the player can't read what the new menu options are supposed to be.

Worse in the game all the NPCs lips stop moving when they talk. I think the game has issues with finding the right subtitles for the facial animation software. 

Is there any way this could be revisited to see why some of the pointers are off?

I would be eternally grateful for any help in figuring out this bug/glitch.

Thanks!
