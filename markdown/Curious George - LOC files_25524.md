- Post Title: Curious George - LOC files

Hi, I need help, I have these .loc files that inside possess the text and audio of a game. I wanted to use the ps2 version file to translate the pc version, but the files are not compatible.

Curious George, only the ps2 version is multilanguage, all other versions (gamecube, xbox and pc) are in English.
