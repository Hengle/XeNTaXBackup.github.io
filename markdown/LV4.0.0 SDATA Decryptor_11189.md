- Post Title: LV4.0.0 SDATA Decryptor

Okay I'm going to decryption of Kingdom hearts 1.5 HD Remix's .sdat's.

I have the decryptor but it's very unstable and does not write out a log when it decrypts file so I need a programmer that can make a log show up by editing the source code. 

What I want it to show is something like this:

Decrypting xa_pp_3030.mset.sdat...
Done!

Decrypting xa_su_simba_e0.mset.sdat...
Failed!

SDATA decryption complete!


ERROR! Buffer overflow!

Going to XMB!

If you can't do the buffer overflow part that is fine. I just need to see what files are decrypting and not.

HERE IS THE SOURCE

The problem with asmodean's source code is that he keeps some required include files for himself, so even if someone fixes the source code there's no way to re-compile it until asmodean releases these include files ("as-util.h" in this case, but other tools from him require other/different header files)

I tried contacting him about that twice already (even in Japanese), but he didn't respond

Have you guys tried using Jikkyu's EDAT Rebuilder 1.45c version? It has a function to decrypt/encrypt/rebuild for both EDAT/SDAT files.

Most EDAT can be decrypted on these days if you have valid KLIC keys and RAP keys [if it's NP-DRM type], 

If you guys have hard time messing with EDAT / SDAT files I can always help you guys out,

I just signed up on this website and it seems really cool and resourceful 

Hopefully I could get to learn things so I can move on to the next level 

I'm very interested in localizing games
