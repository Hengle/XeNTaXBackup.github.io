Since NifSkope cannot handle .nif files from X360's Marvel Avengers: Battle for Earth, guess just
have to write a simple obj converter.

For xpr archive unpacker & textures extractor please visit [this post](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=16586)

Ussage:
Drag and drop a nif file onto the program. Supports multiple files but suggest to use batch processing commands:

```
for %%f in (*.nif) do Nif2OBJ.exe "%%f"
```

But make sure to place the .nif files in the same folder as the tool.

Warningï¼š
Do NOT use this tool on other nif files that're not from this game!

Oh and thank you much! I literally just gave up on trying to convert these ones this morning too. Noting and for a few of my questions around here I know I really have to just stop and put in the time to learn proper scripting. But again ty, mind if use to extract some models and host them on DA? Will credit you for your end of the work of course.

Use the tool all on your own risk mate! And don't forget about the texture tool to AceWell's credit.

Hello. Thanks a lot for your tool. 
I have a question, it'll be hard to believe but, I use Win XP SP3, I have no other OS; right now I can't run the tool, how can I use it? There's any chance to create a compatible version for my OS?.
