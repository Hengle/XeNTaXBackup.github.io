- Post Title: PSVita Sword Art Online Hollow Realization

I dumped the files and they all are in several folders (chr,map,sound etc...) I am interested on map and character models, however I have no knowledge on programming and writing scripts. I did tons of googling and no result. Anyone willing to help?

Some are .bin, .dat and some are unknown just labeled as "file"..
