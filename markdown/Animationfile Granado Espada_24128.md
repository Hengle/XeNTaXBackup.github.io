- Post Title: Animationfile Granado Espada

Hello there,

im looking at the game called Granado Espada. I can ectract the Models there but i cant open the animations like going, fighting positions ect.
IÂ´ll attach the files(a character out of the game and the animation files) with this post. Does anybody know which program can open the animations? Maybe its even possible to open the animation .lma file in Blender?

Thanks in advance!
