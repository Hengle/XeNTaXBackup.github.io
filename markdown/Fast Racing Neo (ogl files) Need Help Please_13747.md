- Post Title: Fast Racing Neo (ogl files) Need Help Please

Well the new F-Zero GX has been released few week ago and I got the sound folder with the permission of AnonRunzes from the HCS forum but the format is not playable on foobar it a ogl file and he guess that they contain the Ogg Vorbis data (in fact, he has examined the file through an hex editor), but it impossible to extract on vgmtoolbox.

[Sound Folder](https://mega.nz/#!wV81wYTI!P-0UScNR5abi90A3K1D-0535jzhK90UrbatNf5TxUtU/)

Help anybody, anyone...?

Thank for the help !
