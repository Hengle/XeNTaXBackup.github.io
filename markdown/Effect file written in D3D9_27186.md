- Post Title: Effect file written in D3D9

Hi All,
I would like to investigate the binary structure of a 3D effect file written with D3D9. It is a Kingsoft game, I know the file contain path to: model, texture, animation files. Among that, there are other parameters I cannot understand yet.
If anyone has experience with this file type, appreciate if you could share a hint.
