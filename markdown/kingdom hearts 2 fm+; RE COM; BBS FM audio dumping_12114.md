- Post Title: kingdom hearts 2 fm+; RE COM; BBS FM audio dumping

I am trying to get the audio off the games mentioned in the title, in order to make a modding asset library:

Kingdom Hearts 2 Final Mix+
Kingdom Hearts RE: CoM
Kingdom Hearts BBS FM

I managed to successfully get the audio off the first game, and PSound can help me for the second.

I got Truthkey's extractor for BBS and Xeynaamo's dumper for KH2, but neither extracts what I need apparently.
Falo's dumper is broken for me, refuses to work

There was a SSCF viewer (not extractor) for BBS, but I cannot find it.

grow increasingly desperate as options stop to work. can someone help?

Update: Xeeynamo's dumper is not supposed to work with those. I again tried Falo, but it refuses to cooperate. any help?
