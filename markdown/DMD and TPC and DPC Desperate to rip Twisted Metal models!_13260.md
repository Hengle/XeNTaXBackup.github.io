- Post Title: DMD and TPC and DPC? Desperate to rip Twisted Metal models!

So I'm fully aware of this thread: [viewtopic.php?f=10&t=3901&hilit=twisted+metal](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=3901&hilit=twisted+metal)

Ripping TIM files from either Twisted Metal 1, or 2. Regardless whether it's the PlayStation or PC version (I said this correctly, there IS in fact a rare PC version of Twisted Metal 1, even rarer than the PC version of Twisted Metal 2, only a few copies exist AFAIK) is in fact pretty easy.

It's the models that are killing me, I've looked everywhere but to no avail.

Does anyone around here know anything about these models? I'll be honest, I'm desperate to make an open source Twisted Metal 1/2 remake for PC, all I really need is to be able to rip models of things like the levels, the cars, etc.

I can rip the sounds just fine using "VABTool," featured in PSY-Q SDK for PlayStation 1, and PSX Hack Tools 2.0. I can also work with the sound files using VAGEdit. Sound isn't an issue.

Like I said, TIM files are easy. Just use like TIMmay or TIMTool or something of the like. So sprites, and textures, and misc graphics, no problem.

So anyway if anyone knows anything, PLEASE let me know. Thanks!
