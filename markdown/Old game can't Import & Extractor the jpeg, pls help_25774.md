- Post Title: Old game can't Import & Extractor the jpeg, pls help

I love an old game, but it uses .mrg format files, I use NECROTECH FMV-Extractor V1.3 which I found on the net.
This program can extract JPG but cannot import JPEG with my modifications.
(newinfo.mrg can use FMV V1.3 open and see the jpg, but can't open boy01.mrg)
here is .mrg file [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Kj0_gd ... sp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Kj0_gdGonZjECjUBdyMF8z9XFXhbFBJz/view?usp=sharing)

thank you all
