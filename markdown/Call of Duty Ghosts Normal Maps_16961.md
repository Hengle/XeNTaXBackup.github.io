I can't use any normal maps from Call of Duty Ghosts because they all look like this, anyone knows how to convert the .dds file into proper reading?
Thanks!

If you're using Wraith, you use the setting "Patch Normals" and any format other than DDS (PNG / TIFF are lossless). It will properly convert the output.
