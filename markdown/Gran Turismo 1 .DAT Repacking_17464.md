- Post Title: Gran Turismo 1 .DAT Repacking

I unpacked SOUND.DAT (Gran Turismo 1) with GTDATUnpacker.exe and I want to repack this file because of sound modding.
I know GT1 - GT4 soundbanks have the same format and I can port them from other GTs to GT1 with repacker.
But I cannot make scripts and programs to repack .DAT (GTARC).
Could someone does it?

Gran Turismo file.
(There are Packed and Unpacked folders.)
