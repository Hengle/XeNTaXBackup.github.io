- Post Title: Model or texture files??!

Hello everyone! So, i extracted a large game data file, (naruto uzumaki chronicles), and i found some files that seems to be models or textures, idk what's the format, i'll leave 2 samples...
if i delete them from the game, the naruto and kisame (characters) respectively disappear.
PS: these files can be more than 2 and have some cuts that I didn't identify, i left a list with the possible (or not) actual game files...
