- Post Title: Double Fine Tool (The Cave, Stacking etc.)

Great utility for unpacking and repacking files from Double Fine games like The Cave, Costume Quest, Stacking and Iron Brigade.

We can unpack files with extension *.~h and *.~p and pack them again into archives. Also text tool allows us translate only strings and put them again in game.

DOWNLOAD DOUBLE FINE TOOL
It's a great tool, but after I change the font of the game "Costume Quest", the game show no letters.

The toolkit does the job perfectly, but it can not extract the texts from the X360 files of Brutal Legend, it generates a 0kb file. Any other solution?
