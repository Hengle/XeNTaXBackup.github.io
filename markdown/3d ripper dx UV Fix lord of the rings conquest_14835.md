- Post Title: 3d ripper dx UV Fix lord of the rings conquest

Hello guys,

i'm new on this forum, and i just tried for a couple of days to rip a model from a game (lord of the rings conquest).

But when i import .obj file on blender, the UV coordinates are really messy.

How can i fix that? (i also import .3dr in 3ds max 2009 and have the same problem).

Thanks!
