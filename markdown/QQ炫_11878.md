Hello guys, well as I say before, I cleaning all my garbage of my HDD, so I decide install any game I download before for study format, but a lot of games I delete before so hope somebody can help with this one, the files stored in .PAK, so maybe somebody can take a look into files to unpack them? I know quality of this game is not the best but well if somebody can take a look grateful.
