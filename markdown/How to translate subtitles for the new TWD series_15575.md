- Post Title: How to translate subtitles for the new TWD series?

Hi everyone. ^^

I'm looking for a way to edit by myself the game's subtitles. I searched for it, but couldn't really find anything. When I find something, there's no real explanations on how to do it, just some softwares thrown at someone on a forum. Could someone tell me how to edit subtitles, or at least redirect me on a link explaining how to do it ?
