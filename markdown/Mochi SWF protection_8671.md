- Post Title: Mochi SWF protection?

This little aspect has irritated the heck out of me almost every time I try to convert an SWF to an offline version I can take with me on my travels. Has anyone managed to crack it so the SWF is fully 'extractable' so to speak? I like to use the images for relevant wikis as well, but lately it's been difficult to obtain them properly. If anyone has a method of bypassing the accursed mochimedia protections on swfs such as those on Nitrome, please either post it here or contact me through PM...
