- Post Title: White Knight Chronicles II 3D models

Hello!

I've been trying to extract models from the PS3 game 'White Knight Chronicles II', but I have no idea how to convert/open the .p3 formats (.p3mmg , .p3msk , .p3msh and .p3mms) that I assume contain the 3D model data. (Was able to get to them and the textures thanks to Chrrox' thread here  : [viewtopic.php?f=10&t=5037&hilit=white+knight+chronicles](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=5037&hilit=white+knight+chronicles) )
Apparently it's a format the game 'Ni No Kuni' also uses but I couldn't find anything to extract the models from this game either.
Tried to use HextoObj and ModelResearcher for this but hex reading/editing is quite difficult for me  

Here are the files I'm trying to figure out currently (I hope it's allowed to share these)

Any help is appreciated!
( sorry if I posted this in the wrong section, first time posting on this forum! )

Man I've resorted to ninja rippering the Rpcs3 game I would have to find out how to patch the game to the latest version
so I can get my old GR 30 character.

(Maybe simply a misinterpretation of data?)

heh, I noticed that I forgot to add reading the name as a string before the first null byte (in SkelFinder). and you also can to add (as in this file) reading lines by indentation
