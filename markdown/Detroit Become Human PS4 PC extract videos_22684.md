Somebody else asked me for the same thing so I gave them my script for extracting BINK videos. 

Here's the link. Just edit the .ini file and run the bat. Make sure you have enough space!

Some of the videos don't have file names, and some of them (the large ones especially) don't seem to play with the RAD Video Tools. Can anybody get these videos playing?

My script has only been tested on the PC version btw.
