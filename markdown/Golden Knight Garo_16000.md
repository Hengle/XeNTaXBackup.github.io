Hello guys, some time I came across this game and I was enchanted with the models of it so I tried to extract the models and give up by the time I did not know how to do it and I did not know XENTAX, well I tried again and I came across some files that I am not fully aware of it.
As the File is quite large I will leave the download link of the complete game has few megs.

I hope everyone helps.
