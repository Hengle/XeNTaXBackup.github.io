I know hot to do it, but the tool I coded was for dissidia final fantasy, wich uses BRG GIM files, yours is a PSP-interleaced image, that means that if you use my dissidia modding suite, you can convert mig 2 tim2 and tim2 2 mig, but you have to use game graphic studio to change the interleacing to BRG BEFORE converting the tim2 back to mig, wich can cause some transparency problems, I know how to fix it, but I would need some time:

here is the modding suite:

Use the controls under the bitmap conversion tab + GGS to convert mig to tm2 and vice-versa
TIP :use the color palette from the original mig file in the edited one to fix the transparency.
