- Post Title: How to edit *.dlog and *.prop files in "Telltale Games"

We are half through the translation of "The Wolf Among Us".
I extracted/translated/repacked all the *.landb files in the game but there are still some text that i cannot find to translate.
I can see there are some texts in the *.prop files but i cannot edit them.
And there are also this *.dlog files that i feel like i need to open and translate some texts in it.

How can i open those files? Or what are those files? Some help/explanation would be greatly appreciated !@_@!
