Obvioulsy yes. Brresviewer can export the brres models in .psk format and even in .dae format if i remember well.
All these formats support the bones and can be easly imported in max or maya with their related plugins. (search with google).

Well that version should allow you to export tha models as .psk, use "ActorX Importer" to import it into 3d max

tha one that lets you export in .dae is brawbox0.64 beta

MD5 and PSK export retain the bones, these formats can be imported and converted further by many model editing programs as they are fairly widely supported formats. You should have no issues finding importers/exporters for these.

Don't see why you would require dae, but you can convert it to that afterwards.

Thanks, so are the spiky meshes natural? They are the bones but its a little distracting seeing it and the model itself can't be seen. How do I fix that?

If ur using tha PSK importer, just make sure you uncheck tha "See thru mesh" option and if ur bones are bigger than your mesh, or just too big, give it a smaller number like 0.5 in tha "Bone Size" option.
If ur model is too small, give it a higher number, sometimes i gotta put tha " Mesh Scale" to 100 for some models.
After you import and ur bones are an ok size but think they are still in tha way just hide them in tha "Display" tab in 3d max.

Sorry I confused the brresviewer with Brawlbox. It's another cool brres viewer which can export brres models into dae format.
The problem is that less compatible then brresviewer. So u need to do some tricks to work with brres models from different wii games.
