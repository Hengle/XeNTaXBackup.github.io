- Post Title: Model00p files to 3d format

I dug around Google and found a FEAR 1 model extractor, the problem is that the files seem to be packaged as a Model00p type. I can't open these files, so I wanna know if there is a importer or a way to convert them to a different file type.THANKS !

Don't know about existing importer, but I worked with .Model00p format in other games. Post here samples (also should be other file type .Mesh00p it's skeleton), and I'll take a look
