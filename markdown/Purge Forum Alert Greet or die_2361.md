Two weeks from now, we will clean the forum memberlist and all those that have survived, but never posted once, will be slain as dictated by the rituals. 

Therefore, we invite anyone with 0 posts that wishes to remain registered (to retain access to attachments and other special forum features) to post a greeting message in this thread. 

Those of you that have already posted once are save from annihilation, but do feel free to post a greeting message anyway, to set an example to those undead lurking in the shadows.  

Operation: Cleansweep is imminent!

You've got a point. We have raised it to two weeks. 

We will send another notice next sunday, indicating the raised limit. 

Then a final notice two days before the deadline. Please ignore both if you have already posted or are a forum regular. Thanks.

So, to fight spam.... you spam?

Listen, If a user has never posted, and is not a vip user, then their forum account is worthless; they can easily sign up again. Just do it.

It's even easier for you to press delete when you get e-mail you don't want from us. We send about two e-mails a year to this list so I don't consider that a problem or spam.

Agree. Not spam in the least.  Someone either doesn't know what spam is, or was loosely categorizing all electronic mail as spam for the purposes of a clever turn of phrase.  Silly.     

I'm actually happy you sent the message.  Thanks, Captain!

 Yes, still alive, although not into gaming that much as I used to do 
Moved from PCZone to Spelletjesgarnaal and got f*cked over when they changed their name to Arena51 ... so I decided to stop writing and enjoy myself with my clan. I do miss the 'old' PCZone days though.

Keep it up! (I should visit your site more often, hehe)

At this time, they will continue to be banned. If we can't see 'em, they don't exist, right?

The rituals dictate that all those creatures that swarm and multiply like microbes in a drop of water, but never show signs of intelligent life, be slain, cleansed of their foul souls. Governed by the urge to spam these Tainted Accounts were created. Satisfied with just having their evil names present in the Holy Xentax Forum Hall Of Heroes, or stopped in their dark tracks of spamming by Overseers (resulting in 0 posts) they now face imminent obliteration.  Those that are able to show signs of intelligent life have been given the generous opportunity to leave a message in this thread. Once the 14 days Circle of Respite is complete, the rituals shall be carried out.

1. Because we delete all of their spam posts. 
2. They don't post, but just spam by registering with a specific website in their profile (this has been turned off some time ago, new users won't see a "Website" field to fill in until they have at least ten posts). 
3. They don't post, but just spam by having some productname as their username. 

In any event, they will have 0 posts and need to be destroyed in the most horrible way.

If you really don't want to recieve emails from XeNTaX, humbly ask one of our malevolent (benevolent?) administrators to delete your account with extreme malice (kindness?)

And already 9 new spammers in 12 hours. I've killed them. And also enabled Admin Approval for new members. I think I may set up a special email address to apply for membership of this forum. I am sick and tired of this scum.

i didn't say i didnt want my account, i just dont want the email.  i paid to get the full version of xentax for one of my games, and i use it. i occasionally browse the forum to read threads and try plugins.  If i payed to buy a program from any other company, and they sent me pointless emails too, i would complain there as well, so fuck off with you opinion.

Honestly, I think this whole crusade of yours is quite hilarious. If you really don't want to recieve these lovely occasional emails, there's a setting in your profile where you can specify not to recieve them. Keep in mind, though, Admins can override this setting if they really need to. Regardless, the two emails you got from XeNTaX were NOT pointless, they were important notifications, and had you not recieved them, your account would have been deleted, as you had no posts before you first posted in this thread. And as has also been pointed out, those will likely be the only emails sent from this board to all members for the next six months, and likely even longer. In any case, you should be thanking mr.Mouse and Captain that they thought enough of the forum members to actually notify everyone before they did this - I know plenty of people who would have just done it, no warning at all.

Well, well, well. 

I for one must say that our destruction of all things evil has been thorough and countermeasures taken to ensure hygiene at this board have been very effective to date! 

Gone are the spammers! Gone are the spamregistrations!

It is amazing to see how fast these spammers from Hell catch up. 

So I introduced this custom field to be entered at the registration form, right. Like, a simple valid reason to want to join this board. 
It didn't take long for the first spammers to come in. 

First, I got empty fields (spaces, those fields that were not filled in, would not even register). 
Then, I got fields with "Super" or "Cool"  or "Excellent", which was so easy to spot as spam.  Because their emailaddresses and website fields would always be spam. 
Finally, some fuck has implemented this particular type of custom field into some auto phpBB spam fucking program. Hits on forum.xentax.com shot up and I get notified of "people" applying for registration with reason fields that filled screens of spam urls. To those lamers I say: die a horrible death now please. You're still not registering at this site, so you're a clown.
