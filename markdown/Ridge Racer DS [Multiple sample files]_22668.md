- Post Title: Ridge Racer DS [Multiple sample files]

So, I have brought my clueless self here to ask if anyone's got any idea how to get these DS files? I'm aware of N64 version of this game, but I was hoping to be able to get entire track models in one fell swoop, opposed to grabbing bits and pieces of tracks and manually stitching them all together. Think anyone here could help?
