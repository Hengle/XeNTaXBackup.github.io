I am a Japanese.
Because I am not good at English, I translate Japanese into English using translation software.
There may be the part which it is hard to read, but thank you for your understanding.
When unpack does dat file of Mobile Suit Gundam Online, help is necessary.
I saw some associated topics, but seem to be over without being settled all.
Mobile Suit Gundam Online is the game which headlock produced.
Similarly some games using the hed/dat file exist.
・pandora saga
・ai sp @ ce
・Wizardry Online dat

As for it, hed file seems to become the key using ROT encryption, but the method to pick up the contents does not know.
Would you tell me the method?
I put the downloading URL of the set of the hed/dat file about the font considered to be the simplest and the set of hed/dat about the video as a sample first of all.
