- Post Title: Star Wars - TFU - .sbk

Hello there...

I can't seem to find a way to get this (these filetypes) to work:
[http://tpiom.webs.com/cscc001_02_00_p05lsen.sbk](http://tpiom.webs.com/cscc001_02_00_p05lsen.sbk)

It's a file from The Force Unleashed (PS2... or was it my PSP rip?) but I can't seem to get a way to play it. 
The recommended program to handle .sbk files is Awave Studio. No luck there. It just plays static, saying it's not supported.

Help?
