- Post Title: Dark Souls 2 - Ð¡hange the language

Hello, friends. I have some problems with Dark Souls 2. The problem is that the language in the DS does not change. I'm talking about the XBOX 360 version of the game. I have NTSC-U version of the console, but I am Russian and I can't switch language to Russian. Though region and language of Dashboard in Russian, the game starts in English.

So, what I mean? I want to replace the files of English into Russian. I'm searched information about that in this forum and I learned how to unpack DS files (using DSExplore v0.1 by Nyxojaele), but didn't understand how to repack them back. Someone have any ideas how this can be done? Maybe you have an idea how else to fix it?

Sorry for my English.
