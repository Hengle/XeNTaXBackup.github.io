- Post Title: [PS3] Kidou Senshi Gundam Extreme VS Full Boost - Voice Rips

I was looking on many sites for a way of extracting the voice files from this game but so far, nothing worked, i tried quickbms, MFAudio, PSound, even the xentax.exe program i found in a similar top√¨c discussing about file extraction from this game. However, that program only extracted models. Can anyone help me out with this? I really need those voice files. Thanks!

I'll leave a file map in case somebody knows where should i look.
