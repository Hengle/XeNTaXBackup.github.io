Huckleberrypie had the swell idea to see if next up we could manage to convert the Gangnam Style dance to other game characters!   check this for animation files!

I think I might end up doing this for Lemony Snicket and a few other Unreal games.

Thats not a bad idea... I have no idea about skyrim animation files thou...  if possible, it's easy to create new animation files in 3dsMax, but the exporting could become difficult...

Haha, awesome. Too bad they didn't get the actual dance moves in, though. Funny nonetheless

The *.pmd files contain bones and provides your base pose. I could view the *.vmd animations with the MikuMikuDance v7.39 software. The 2.vmd file from that archive linked from youtube has messed up animation from frame 550-700.

I like Gangnam Style. It is very funny video/music.
Sometimes I feel I want to do the Gangnam Style but I fail hard
