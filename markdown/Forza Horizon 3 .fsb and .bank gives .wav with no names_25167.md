- Post Title: Forza Horizon 3 .fsb and .bank gives .wav with no names?

The fsb_aud_extr.exe gives .wav files with no names only 0000000_0.wav or something undescriptive but can anyone crack this problem of naming of these FH3 .fsb and .wav files so they give names when ran through the fsb_aud_extr.exe? I should say it extracts from the fsb file working audio but they are just so many and it would save time and headache to have namings of them otherwise you have to listen if its exhaust or intake sound which does not always work out. I hope someone can crack this.

Link to download the zip including fh3 files: [https://www.mediafire.com/file/8aj40b7v ... s.zip/file](https://www.mediafire.com/file/8aj40b7v4p59gph/FH3audiofiles.zip/file)

Seems like the OP from this thread [viewtopic.php?f=17&t=24872&p=180672&hilit=Forza#p180672](https://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=17&t=24872&p=180672&hilit=Forza#p180672) also has the same issue.

Maybe this could help?

The first guy link has same problem as me but the second guys link he is extracting fh1 and fh2 they use older format which i already have extracted myself. Fh3 and Fh4 and possibly Fh5 use some kind of different format that when run through the script of unpacking .bank into .fsb gives a name of "00000000.fsb" and then when you run this file through a fsb unpacking script called "fsb_aud_extr.exe" it gives files like this which is very hard to separate if you dont have names:
