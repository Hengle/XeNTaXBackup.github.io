- Post Title: Resident Evil 8 Village - demo PAK file

The demo for Resident Evil 8 Village is available for preload using this link: steam://install/1541780.
The assets are all in a 9GB re_chunk_000.pak file. I've tried RE2Hook but the game won't launch with that installed.

A new hook file has to be created, previous game filenames won't work with RE8.

here is a sort of working hook by fluffyquack from the re modding forum, cant really do much with it as the servers required to play the demo are currently down but the hook does generate a filelist for some assets.

here is also a partial filelist also compiled by fluffyquack if you want to experiment with it: [https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/ ... lease.list](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/724331856002285679/837649137280483328/re8_pak_names_release.list)

The partial list combined with REtool and the latest RE_MESH seem to be working perfectly

I found such a file in the game files "ch02_1020facialbasic.motlist.486" maybe this is it, but I do not know how to open it

Is there a .BMS script available for this Demo yet? I am looking to extract the textures only not interested in modding or the models. I usually use Quick BMS and then correct the textures using Noesis I have everything I need except for a .BMS script. Any help would be greatly appreciated, thanks.

Hello, I really need your help. I also know 'retool' works perfectly, but it's currently the only thing that's impossible to extract 'mastermaterial'. I would really appreciate it if anyone could provide us with a way or tool to convert it into an available format(tga, jpg, png, etc..).

The file is 'mmtr.2102188797' format.

Can anyone help. The file with all the re_chunk_000 resources can be easily unpacked into a folder, but how can I pack it back into one file?

Shadow of Rose was released yesterday. Is there anyone who can upload new list file of the dlc to us? DLC file can't be extracted with current list file of RE8. We need a new list file.
