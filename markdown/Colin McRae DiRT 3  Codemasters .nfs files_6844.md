Goddamn that's a coincidence that someone posted in this very thread so recently. I AM looking for an unpacker for the dlc cars too (dirt 3 only though), will anyone help us out?

You can use offzip as aluigi has pointed out in the past but the zlib blocks come out as 128KB chunks. Any files under 128KB come out o.k. just have to be renamed to the correct name if you care. But the files that are bigger than 128KB need to to have all the parts joined together. Its not too hard to figure that part out. but of course you need to know which parts and how many parts. File size is written in the header of the file so that can be calculated to how many 128KB parts. Then the name of the chunks are sequential so you can just count hte amount of files, and join those parts together.

Just to say on internet are a exe with those files already extracted, there are the m3 rally,delta s4, stratos etc.. But not the others like Mini Gymkhana or Escort MkII, can't understand how the author of that mod installer as extracted the nfs files     

Other thing is the Grid 2, DLC's are also on rare file extension but this time is nefs...
