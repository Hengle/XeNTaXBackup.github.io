it seem (afaik) that its a not packed huge file who contain packed files (arc)

i've looking with the rip version done by people who know how to extract almost any formats and it was a big file,only 200mo zipped,with all ogg ripped file,re-injected,with a bunch of small custom formats.

search for ARC into the nig files and you'll find a bunch of them..but what unpack ARC and what's inside?!...its another story i dont know

The format of the files is a little weird, but I think I have it figured out. I will try to write some scripts or something for this format over the next few days.

Game Street Racing Syndicate has a similar format of archive... Only here Game Extractor does not open it   ... Probably structure little bit different... Watto you will not look at structure of archive of game Street Racing Syndicate?

Hi mate,

I have looked at a file from Street Racing Syndicate before but I couldn't get anything out of it. If there is another file we can look at, it might help.

Thanks mate.
