- Post Title: Resident Evil 5 Sound Files: help request

I'm modding resident evil 5, and I've run into a little problem when I was doing sound file modding.
Some of the sounds appeared to be hard coded, or locked away in the files.

The sound files I'm talking about are the pain sounds and the grunting sounds of the playable characters of Resident Evil 5.

I've seen the following footage on this forum:
[http://residentevilmodding.boards.net/t ... over-chris](http://residentevilmodding.boards.net/thread/6095/re6-leon-voice-over-chris)

I've noticed that they've also still kept the pain sounds of the original characters.

The file extension I could find in ..\sound\se\pl
Examples:
se_pl00.srq
se_pl00.srd
se_pl00.ase


So, what am I looking for?
I'm looking for someone that is able to play the audio information in these files, in the right way.
I think an encoder of some kind would be needed for that.
Do you think you can help? Please let us know by replying to the thread.

Cheers.

Nothing is hardcoded.

If I recall correctly, Resident Evil 5 sound effects are all stored within .SPC files. I wrote a tool several years ago to manage the format, it should be floating around somewhere.

Regards.

Hey Gh0stblade,

Thanks for the reply. As far as I am aware the modders have been able to alter every in game sound for the characters expect one specific area. This is the pain and attack reaction sounds. Do you have any info on where this SPC tool would have been shared? 

Thank you.
