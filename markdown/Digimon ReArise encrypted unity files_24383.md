A simple AES can be decrypted, but this game has a database like Dictionary somewhere,
which brings key information from it and gets the key and iv through some processing. Decryption is very difficult. 
There are users who have already succeeded in decrypting, but it seems that not all files have been decrypted.

Thanks for response einherjar007! I found some other files, gonna upload them maybe there are something related to the key, and are people that decrypted every model of this game, but dunno how they do and doesn't want to give some advices on how to start.

DKDave investigated it on discord. In the past, ReArise used AES encryption, but it seems that the method has changed.

Apparently it's simple xor now.
