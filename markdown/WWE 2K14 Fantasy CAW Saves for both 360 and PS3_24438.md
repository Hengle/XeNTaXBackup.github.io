- Post Title: WWE 2K14 Fantasy CAW Saves for both 360 and PS3?

Hello everyone,
I am Seth.
I am looking for anyone that has any fantasy CAWS for WWE Games like SVR 2010, all the way up to WWE 2K14.

the CAW creators that I am going to mention are people who have made fantasy CAWS in the past.

"SSPD077" (made various CAWS from video games, H-Anime, etc) (unfortunately something tragic happened to him about his Xbox and recently his personal and family life. when I messaged him on DeviantArt. he's going through a lot right now.)

"M Hale Gaming" (made CAWS of Mortal Kombat, Street Fighter, etc characters)

"Itachi4937" (very detailed CAW creator made CAWS up to 2K14 Last Gen)
