- Post Title: Metroid Prime 3 CSMP Format.

Hi everyone.
i'm looking into converting the audio format (.CSMP) of metroid prime 3 into a useable format for a project that may be taking place on garrysmod to create an arm cannon swep, i need the specific audio clips with no background noise to achieve this.
I will upload a sample CSMP file for people to look at, hopefuly someone around here can provide some insight or a converter to help me out.

Sample File: [http://www.mediafire.com/?a2uu7obwscbg6ti](http://www.mediafire.com/?a2uu7obwscbg6ti)

Kind Regards
