- Post Title: Motorstorm Pacific Rift .rpk files

Hello, Xentax, and good time of the day to you. Once again I'm asking for your help: I'd like to take a look inside said .rpk files. Pretty sure they have models and textures inside them - well, I only really need the textures, but I'll be grateful for any result.

My fairly limited skills tell me that the archive is not encrypted, and that's all I can say - and I can be wrong, yea... I've found several tools and scripts for .rpk-named files from other games, yet they all yielded no results.

Here are several of these files attached: [http://www.mediafire.com/file/pqa1gooe8 ... k.rar/file](http://www.mediafire.com/file/pqa1gooe8t2ml6q/MSPRrpk.rar/file) - with the track_garage.rpk being the one that I actually need.

Thanks.

Hah, full circle. That Arctic Edge script have been written by Acewell when I've asked for help with that game in another thread. Unfortunately, I haven't figured out what I should change in that script in order for it to work with Pacific Rift. Besides, there are several complications: while Arctic Edge and Pursuit Force were both made by BigBig Studios, Pacific Rift has been developed by Evolution Studios - and they might've used a different method. And, likely, PSP and PS3 archives differ in a number of ways. Anyway, by comparing Arctic Edge archives with Pacific Rift, I cannot really see much similarities. Maybe I'm looking at it in the wrong way though...

Thanks for the link anyway though!

Hmmm sorry it didnt help man :-/
Is there other games by Evolution studios that have already been figured out?

EDIT:

Dunno, maybe it helps you 

I just went on Wikipedia and Found out, that Evolution studios had an outpost at bigbig studios....
Heres the games they developed at "home" and At there outpost:

Thanks! It kinda helps: I totally forgot about RPCS3. It probably can be used in a number of ways. For example, if it does support DX9 rendering, TexMod can be hooked and the textures can be ripped by said program. Several other possibilities exist, so... I should definitely take a look here and there...

Thanks for the info about BigBig and Evolution as well. Still, the archives of Arctic Edge and Pacific Rift look very different to my untrained eye.

Hah! Let me go a bit off the topic then: do you know there's a savegame mod which unlocks tons of unused liveries for MSMV?

I've seen unused Skins, when i gave motorstorm a little Deeper research yesterday. But i didnt know that theres so much unused stuff   
That screams for an own section at the vg-resource 

Whats MSMV, though?

Ouch. MV stands for Monument Valley - and it means the first game. But I've actually meant to write PR - which means Pacific Rift. And yes, Pacific Rift has tons of them - I've myself unlocked more than 50 unused skins several months ago. Granted, most of them are the same skins that were in MSMV, yet still. And there is also a couple of unused skies, though to use these you need to directly edit the memory of your PS3.

On the other hand, Monument Valley also has a couple of unused skins. Yet I guess they will never be edited into the savegame, since it uses its own encryption algorithm, which is not recognized by Bruteforce. This means somebody will have to decrypt and then re-encrypt the save before even trying to edit it...

Had no time to spare, unfortunately. But from what I've read about RPCS3 so far, it looks like it doesn't support DirectX 9, so TexMod is not an option.

There's a slight chance that I'm wrong though, until I'll actually check it for sure.

Yes, these .rpk files I've attached in the first post were originally packed into .psarc archives.

So you assume 3d models are in the rpk file?
Do you have Screenshots of the Folder structure?

You mean, the screenshots of unpacked .psarc - this kind of folder structure? I do not. But it is not hard to make it if you need them...

I'm not sure about the models, but the textures are there for sure: skies are stored in the similar archives, and you can swap which one the game loads in the memory of PS3, which gives an ability to load, for example, volcanic skies on non-volcanic tracks.

The models are very likely inside it as well though. Just take a look in the file with the hex-editor, and you'll see what I mean.

I sure will, once I'll have any kind of progress. So far I'm too busy with my YouTube requests and real life job.
This thing was a request as well, actually, so I'm not giving up on it easily. I'll definitely get on it full-time in a week or so.

Is this some known structure (from track_garage.rpk) or is it just random points?
(With auto generated face indices it looks too regular to be random, doesn't it?)

No. Unfortunately, I've got overwhelmed with a real life. Mainly, the job. Got tight on money and stuff, so this little project went a bit sideways.

It... definitely looks familiar, but at the same time I can't recognize anything in particular. Looks like... at least a part of the room where the player should choose a driver, but badly generated or something.

This is a thread I have been waiting on for a long time. Keep up the good work.

Well, as I'm planning to get back to it in a week or two, I gotta say I'm not sure if i'll be able to unpack it, and it looks like the more skilled are unable as well or maybe just not interested in it - so, my current idea to get what I got involves installing a PS3 emulator and then making a cheesy camhack to get a good look at the texture I need in the game itself. Not sure if it will work, but usually it does.
