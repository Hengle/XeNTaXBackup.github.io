Hi, I'm trying to figure out how to view information in a file with the .data format. 

I will be glad if someone helps. A few files for the example below.

@Silyo: It looks like serialized database (maybe with additional bytecode if it's processed via some script system). The only thing you can do with it out of the box is preview text strings and some raw values, if you open those files as text with utf8 encoding.

It looks like I found the script and apparently it's a .lua file, but it's also encrypted. Maybe you know how to decrypted it?
