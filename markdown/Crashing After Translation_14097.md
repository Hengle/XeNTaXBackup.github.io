- Post Title: Crashing After Translation

I translate games as hobby nowadays, so decided to translate broken sword II, found text.clu file and translated subtitles as far as I could, changed with original file and clicked to start game but it errors "game has stopped to working",  how can i fix that? It's about character count in file or what?

Why you don't try it by yourself? Don't change the length of sentences and you will know if there is some limitation.

Put there original file and start experimenting.
