- Post Title: Nanobreaker (PS2/Soundtrack)

Hi everyone, I would really extract the soundtrack of Nanobreaker, but I don't know how to proceed.
I hope someone more experienced than me can help me. Below the link to the archive containing all the audio tracks:

Use vgmtoolbox / misc / extraction / generic / advanced cutter

load "playstation 2 SVAG" preset

it will extract all 52 songs

convert them with test.exe

Thanks daemon1, but what Playstation 2 SVAG?

There are these preset for PlayStaion 2 :
PlayStation 2 - beatmaniaIIDX BMDX Streams
PlayStation 2 - Dance Dance Revolution KCES Streams
PlayStation 2 - Dance Dance Revolution SVAG Streams
PlayStation 2 - HD File
PlayStation 2 - SQ File
PlayStation 2 - Square Enix VSF Streams
PlayStation 2 - SShd/SSbd Streams Type 1
PlayStation 2 - SShd/SSbd Streams Type 2
PlayStation 2 - SShd/SSbd Streams Type 3
PlayStation 2 - STER Streams
PlayStation 2 - VAGp Streams Type 1
PlayStation 2 - VAGp Streams Type 2
PlayStation 2 - VAGp Streams Type 3

Then I can't extract the file, because when I select for to test one of these, when I have dragged and dropped the file "FILEDATA.BIN" in "Files to search" appear an error which is write "Search String cannot be empty".

See the "Dance Dance Revolution" name I thought I was making the wrong selection. Anyway the program continue to give me this error "Search String cannot be empty", I have first load the preset, then I have dragged and dropped the archive "FILEDATA.BIN", but this accursed program don't want extract the file.

Sorry Daemon, I had forgot to click load. The program has extracted the soundtrack, but missing 2 songs, respectively in this site [http://downloads.khinsider.com/game-sou ... no-breaker](http://downloads.khinsider.com/game-soundtracks/album/nano-breaker) are:

01 - Opening
19 - Ending - Staff Roll 

Can you please (possibly) check? Sorry for my persistance, but I'd really like to have them all.

they may be in another file, or another format.

I checked this file, there's no more music here. It may not be included in the game and just released on disc.

Thank you for this kindness and for the patience 
Just a curiosity, but the quality of the extracted track is comparable to the original reproduced from the game, or less because of not quite accurate presets (such as offset, interlative value)?

In this case you extracted the files not as a RAW DATA, but as complete music files.

Things like "interleave, offset" are only used when you're trying to guess track properties yourself.

So, quality must be exactly the same as in the game.
