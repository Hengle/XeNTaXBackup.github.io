- Post Title: [ request ] The Walking Dead The Final Season (Telltale)

I'm aware that there exist a couple tools arround the forum about Telltale games, and as i saw from the data files, the game use the same 
 file format as the older games. (.lua, .ttarch2) but if i don't renember well, Telltale moved to unity in this game, and i don't know if these tools will do the work with a change like this. Tbh i'm very rookie with all this stuff so i couldn't bring myself to test it out, so i started this topic to see if it can be done. Thanks y'all

Telltale didn’t move to unity yet.
