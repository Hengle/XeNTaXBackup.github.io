This little tool should work, you'll need to install .net framework 3.5 or higher.

Click thanks if i helped.

that's my script:

[http://aluigi.org/papers/bms/others/onepiece_arc.bms](http://aluigi.org/papers/bms/others/onepiece_arc.bms)

it automatically unpacks the cmp_zlib files and the script is valid for reimporting.
