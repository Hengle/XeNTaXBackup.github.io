- Post Title: Dark Souls 3 model file request

Can someone upload a sample model file from Dark Souls 3? I would like to see if it's format is similar to Dark Souls 1 and 2 (Guessing not, since DS3 uses a new engine.)

The archives are encrypted differently than the previous games, and no one has unpacked them yet.
