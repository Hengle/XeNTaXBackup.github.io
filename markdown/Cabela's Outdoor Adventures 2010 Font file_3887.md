At first U have to place (write, draw) UR characters onthe given DDS textures, after somehow correspond location of each characters... but how and where it to do, for now I do not know, it U have to find. No one will do such thing for U.

Here will help at least if you can't find where to write coordinats for characters. And it's needed. may be game doesn't use coordinats to locate each characters on the map.
