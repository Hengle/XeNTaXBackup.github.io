- Post Title: Battlefield 1 PLAYER MODELS (characters\mp\*Faction*) help..

Before I start I just wanted to say, yes I have seen the threads, and yes I have tried, I just do not know what to do with the .EBX files for playermodels and such, I have also tried dumping the files but something messed up and ruined the process after about a day's download. I was wondering if there is any way to just get only the models and textures. That is all, no guns, no maps, just the uniforms.

I just want to say thank you to anyone who takes the time to help me in this.
(I have stayed up two days trying to figure this out so I am a bit scattered...)
