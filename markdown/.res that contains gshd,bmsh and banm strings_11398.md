- Post Title: .res that contains gshd,bmsh and banm strings

I have a .res file that I need help with extracting.In a hex editor i noticed the file contained strings with such names as gshd,surf,strg,bmsh,banm,indx and bodya.My best guess out of the two is that bmsh must be the mesh file and banm must be the animation.If anyone could help extract the contents of the file will be greatly appreciated.Thank you
