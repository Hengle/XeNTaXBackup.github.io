Hello, everyone! I came here today wondering how can I extract the audio from this awesome game! The formats are .SS2, .uax, .LM2, .LS2, .SM2 from what I can see. I uploaded an [archive](https://www.dropbox.com/s/2g0sgqyqv2h08m3/sounds.rar?dl=0) with some samples. Any ideas?
I tried using Umodel and DecUbi, but to no avail..
