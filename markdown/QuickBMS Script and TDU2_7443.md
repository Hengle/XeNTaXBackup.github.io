- Post Title: QuickBMS Script and TDU2

Hi to all
1st of all i would like to say excuse me if i might be posting in the wrong section of the forum.
2ndly my issue is that i would like to learn to convert TDU2 cars into this racing game called WR2 (World Racing 2)
And i talked to another modder of the game and he told me to start off by downloading QuickBMS and that i needed to extract the .BIG files. So apparently for that i need a script and i don't know which one to get or where to get it. Could somebody send me a link?
