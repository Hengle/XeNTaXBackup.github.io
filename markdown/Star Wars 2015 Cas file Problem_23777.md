- Post Title: Star Wars 2015 Cas file Problem

I tried to unzip a plain dumper with all the files I managed but only got 30GB out. Which is not enough for me. 
I tried to extract one of the .cas files shown in the picture but failed. How should I know? I attach the extractor and a picture of the files.

If you would have posted in the appropriate thread already, i would have noticed sooner, what you used is obsolete and at same time not good, there is a updated, better option: [https://github.com/NicknineTheEagle/Frostbite-Scripts](https://github.com/NicknineTheEagle/Frostbite-Scripts)
