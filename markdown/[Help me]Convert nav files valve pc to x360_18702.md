- Post Title: [Help me]Convert nav files valve pc to x360

hello I'm looking for someone to do byte change and convert this file from pc to xbox 360, I pass the original pc file and xbox360 to compare the conversion

Notice that there are bits that are different only some, not all, and in certain parts

the link:[http://www.mediafire.com/file/q3c92l28f ... +files.zip](http://www.mediafire.com/file/q3c92l28fufsa63/nav+files.zip)

Your help would be very helpful XD

Pd.-so I investigated in the hexworkshop or hexeditor it is seen that the conversion or reverse bytes is 64 and not 32 in segments of 4 bits except the one where the name starts there are 3 pairs of bits and hence there are 4 pairs of bits in 64 what I'm looking for is a script or something that converts those bits individually into 4 pairs per segment in 64
