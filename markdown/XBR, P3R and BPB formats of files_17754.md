- Post Title: XBR, P3R and BPB formats of files

Hello guys, we really need your help!

We are the modders of the game, called Cars: Mater-National Championship.

We have the mod, named Superdrive (Hi-Octane earlier), and here we have a XBR, P3R and bpb files formats, and we can't extract them.

We didn't find anything about these formats, and as we understand - it is custom file formats. 

We need some programmers to help us. Please, write down in the comments if you want to help us. If you can make the extractor - please, write down in the comments too, and give us your Discord name or other contact information, so we can contact you and talk about it.   

Thank you for your attention guys! We are sorry for our grammar mistakes!

I'm also a modder of the same game, and just adding to this, we CAN extract .xbr files... kinda. You see, it does extract, but there are no folders, resulting in a jumbled mess. To add to this some file formats also become corrupted and all files lose their correct filenames and just become a string of random numbers and letters. Some audio files just become loud beeping noises too. Most, if not all files do work correctly however when used in game, so that's a plus.

CBR files are smaller than their CBT counterparts because they contain fewer frames, but they run at the same speed. The P3 (Packed-Picture 3) format is also a variation of CBR. It contains one frame per second but has an additional frame buffer to store more data, which allows for smoother playback.
