- Post Title: Kinect Star Wars .BST/.PVS

Hi folks, Kinect Star Wars seems to still be holding onto some secrets in its data files. I've gone down a rabbit hole recently trying to extract as many of the game assets as the current tools will allow. I've been trying to figure out why so many of the 3D level geometry assets such as buildings and background scenery objects are missing from the game's more obvious files. I noticed there are some .BST and .PVS "sets" for the various game level environments which contain references to models and textures but I can't extract anything from them. They take up a significant amount space (1.38GB) so I suspect they may contain the missing level assets.

Can anyone confirm if the .BST/.PVS files are archives containing additional game assets, and if so, can we extract  and gain access to them?

Here's an archive of all the .PST/.PVS "set" files I have from the game:
