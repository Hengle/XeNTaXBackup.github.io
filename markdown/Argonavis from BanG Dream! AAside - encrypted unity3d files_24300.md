It is hard for me to make a script
I asked other people a hint, but did not know it
Is there the person who can revise this script?

What is the full name of the game?
What version of the game do you have?
And in which directory did you find this "6909bfcb" file? Is it "\assets\bin\Data"?

Argonavis from BanG Dream is AAside before the name of the game
There was the "6909bfcb" file in "file\Cpk"
As there is a form file of cpk, please unfold

But what version of the game do you have exactly? I checked v1.3.0 and there is no such file. Also, you unpacked  OBB first to get the assets, right?
