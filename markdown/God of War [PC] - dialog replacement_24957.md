- Post Title: God of War [PC] - dialog replacement

So the game has Greek in-game audio, as well as subtitles. I found the acting pretty funny and wanna voice some scenes in the Cypriot dialect for the memes.

Which tools can i use to do the voice replacement and if possible sub replacement as well?

Can you please point me to the right direction?

Kind regards

edit: Seems there are 2 types of files: .WEM and .SBP
