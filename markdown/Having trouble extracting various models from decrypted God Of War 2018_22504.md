- Post Title: Having trouble extracting various models from decrypted God Of War 2018

I went through the whole process to get the decrypted fake pkg, decrypted it with orbis-pub-chk, and I'm pretty sure I have the right files. There's r_son00.as, r_freya00.as, and r_hero00.as. I've tried opening them with Noesis to convert to a .obj, but r_hero is the only one that shows a prompt, and it won't let me choose any output options. The others just say the file cannot be previewed.



If I do hit export, it creates a file with no extension called "창창창창". I'm new to this, so if someone could point out what I'm doing wrong, I'd be very grateful!

I've been wanting to extract some models from this game myself... I haven't seen any tools for it yet though. If I may ask, which tool are you trying to use, or is it private at the moment?

Cheers
