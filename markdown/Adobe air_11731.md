- Post Title: Adobe air

hey guy this is just a question 


i just wanted to know is there anyway to take off the adobe air drm from a mp4 my friend brought over some videos and asked me if i would be able to remove the drm so he can convert the files
everything i find on google came out empty handed if someone knows how to remove it that would be a great help
