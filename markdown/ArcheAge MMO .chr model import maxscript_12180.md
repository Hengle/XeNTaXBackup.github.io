- Post Title: ArcheAge MMO .chr model import maxscript

Hi guys! Here's maxscript to import ArcheAge MMO .chr models with bones+weights (3ds max 2009-2012). 
I know there's some tools for models, but as I understand theres no bone and weights (static models), right? So, if anyone will find it useful that's cool  

P.S. Report bugs

Thank you very much! Do you know how to apply animations from AA to this models? I managed to load .caf animations onto character in CryEngine SDK and it even worked properly but I didn't manage to export it properly for 3dsmax...

Add:

Also I'd like to say that many chr files doesn't contain heirarchy of bones (e.g. nu_m_nude.chr) but some other (so called, ***_base.chr e.g. nu_m_base.chr) does. It would be marvelous if script could combine them (mesh and bone weights from one apply to bones from another). 

I managed to export base .chr files to CE SDK and apply .caf animations easily. It required removing Bone_#_* prefix from bones name (line 184) in this script. But base chr files doen't contain skinned mesh itself so only bones were animated. Still couldn't export and import HTR back to 3dsmax properly...

The script works great. But there are a couple of questions about importing animations into max or what are the ways to drive it there

There are a lot of tools for CryTek files, did you tried Noesis for example or script made by joqqy [viewtopic.php?f=16&t=12085&hilit=ryse&start=75](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=12085&hilit=ryse&start=75) ? Otherwise, I will updated my script when I will have time.

Thank you for your answer, I think ï¼Œthe game using the same game engine, the file type is not necessarily the same, so the imported tool are not the same. I'll try the tool you told me, and reply.
sorry about my bad english.
p.s.how to known which game engine does the game use? thank you.

update~[*]sorry about that, the script is for 3dmax 2017. I just have the 3dmax2010~
update~I have a constant error on load ui_.ms: but there is an error.     -- Error occurred in anonymous codeblock; filename: C:\Program Files\Autodesk\3ds Max 2017\scripts\ui_.ms; position: 10538; line: 271
-- Compile error: Can't find include file:  HEADER_.ms
