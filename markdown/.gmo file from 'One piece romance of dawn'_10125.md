Hey, can some one send me an uncompresser for .gmo files?
it has a header of 'cmp lzma', but common lzma tools do no effect.

Seems I can't post link of such kind of file, obeying forum rules.

Sadly that's how it is...

yeah, just remove everything up to (but not including) the 5D and download the 7zip SDK and run the file through lzma.exe (or whatever it's called).

I have no files to test but you can try this quickbms script.

```
get name2 EXTENSION
string name + .ext.
string name + name2
goto 8
get zsize long
get size long
comtype lzma
clog NAME 0x10 zsize size

```

Wow guys excellent! I'm so glad to see you trying. I got good news, a friend of mine was able to figure out a quickbms script that decompresses them:

//One Piece: Romance Dawn (PSP) file decompressor by maver1k_XVII

```
idstring "cmp\0lzma"
get ZSIZE long
get SIZE long
savepos offset
get name BASENAME
string name += "_uncomp."
get ext EXTENSION
string name += ext
clog name offset ZSIZE SIZE 
```


Thanks for trying to help everyone, it seems pretty similar to yours Chrrox.

But thanks for your help.



Edit: Excuse me moderators, I mean no offense, but please do not edit my posts to make it appear as if I were degrading someone by claming their work as stolen, I would do no such thing publicly, and the script was indeed made by maver1k at my plea for help. Similiar discoveries can occur, especially around the same time when I had asked for help at both places, just because one person "invents" the recipe to make bread, doesn't make a combination of the same ingredients "invented" by another person 'stolen'. Humans have the capability to stumble upon the same discoveries without needing interaction or findings of others to find such. After all, the only real rule in the the world of inventions is, it's the guy who patents it who get's credit for the invention of something, but it hasn't always been that they were the first or the only to ever discover and/or develop such things.

Except for the important detail that the second script was written by maver1k_XVII. That is a very important detail as it's clearly what makes the script function. Maybe if your name were chrr0x_MCCCXXXVII instead of chrrox, your scripts would work better.

May i ask, where are these .gmo files located? I am able to extract the CPK file with noesis but that gave alot of .pac files, and every other file is .pac files except from the movie files.

EDIT: I have found the .gmo files by extracting the .pac files. Just gotta get the textures now.

I hadn't noticed that a moderator had edited my post to claim that maver1k's script was stolen. As I already believe to have put in my post once, his script was posted 4 hours earlier than chroxx's post here. It couldn't have been stolen if chroxx hadn't even posted it yet. Proof: [http://www.vg-resource.com/thread-23049 ... #pid540264](http://www.vg-resource.com/thread-23049-post-540264.html#pid540264)

Anyway he sent me a pm and asked me to post this on his behalf:

> Reply from maver1k_XVII

> Hello members of Xentax forum,
I am maver1k_XVII. I apologize for having to ask other person to post this message for me as I don't have my own Xentax account.
The reason I am writing this message is the issue with the LZMA decompressor script, more specificly - the fact that I am being accused of stealing it from chrrox.
On a completely different forum (here) I was asked the same question as you by the same person (Zerox). I didn't really expect that I would be able to help him with this problem but to my own surprise I was abled to figure out the way to uncompress the files relatively easily and quickly. When I finally managed to make it work the way I wanted it to, I posted the link to the script on the forum I mentioned before.
At that time I didn't even know about the fact that chroxx made his own script for the same purpose and posted it in this thread a few hours before I did the same on a different forum.
I hope that is enough to clear that misunderstanding.
I always found it interesting to research the contents of game resources and being able to make scripts that can help other people to extract and view models, textures and so on is a great pleasure for me. I am very greatful to everyone here on Xentax whose work inspired me to learn file format reverse engeneering and for all the tutorials, explanations and publicly available scripts, which I used as examples, that allowed me to do so.
Thank you for your attention.
Sincerly, maver1k_XVII.

Anyway please let us all just get along and not worry about this further. Coincidences happen.

Again I mean no offense to anyone here I appreciate the many things I have learned from you all here, and I hope to someday continue to contribute more.
