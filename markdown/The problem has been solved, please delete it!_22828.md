- are you sure the file is encrypted? those strings look like simple base64 
 - the ida screenshot is rather c++ than c#

What's the tool the last screen taken from?

since it's base64 maybe you should start looking for that in game code to find decryption routine

In .dex files i found AES metioned a few times.

Sorry, I just started learning reverse engineering, I can't read pseudocode, because I'm not a programmer.Could you tell me the detailed steps to find the decryption?Or could you help me find it?Thank you so much!
