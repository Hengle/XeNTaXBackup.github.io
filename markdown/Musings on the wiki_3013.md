- Post Title: Musings on the wiki

Just so you all know, I'm blatently ripping off Mr.Mouse's MultiEx .plan thread for this one, except this is for the wiki... and I'll probably be using it to post rants about working with the software just as much as details for what I have planned for the wiki.

Everyone is, of course, welcome and encouraged to comment on anything I post in this thread, and I'd especially appreciate feedback on my ideas for the wiki. Seriously. I can't count the number of times I've taken an idea that's absolutely incredible in my head and implemented it only to discover it's an utter pile of crap in reality. Like this post. I had it plaaned out perfectly, then I come here to post it, and it just sort of falls apart on me. But enough of that...

If any of you have your own ideas, I'd love to hear them, since it's ridiculously difficult trying to brainstorm by yourself. Anyway, on to my first musing/rant...

My immediate plans for the wiki revolve around a decently large shake-up of the format page structure: I'm going to merge the "MultiEx BMS Script" and "Supported (by) Programs" sections.

At first, I was going to throw the "Games" section into the mix as well by merging it with the MexScript info, until I realized that would make things way too complicated: I would either end up duplicating the list, or it would be implicated that it was MexCom-centric. Therefore, after some careful consideration, I decided to completely separate the game information from the MexScript and other program information.

Speaking of program info, some of you may have noticed a short while back, I did some work on [Template:MexScript](http://wiki.xentax.com/index.php?title=Template:MexScript), and implemented a bit of a test case at [Rebel Raiders: Operation Nighthawk BAG](http://wiki.xentax.com/index.php?title=Rebel%20Raiders:%20Operation%20Nighthawk%20BAG). I plan on expanding the template some more, removing the extension info (see my previous paragraph), and then writing similar templates for Game Extractor, Game File Explorer, and Dragon UnPACKer. Part of my plans for this involve specifying what the program in question can do with a given format (see [this thread](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=13&t=3008)).

In the meantime, I'll be trying to find the time to continue steal-err, copying templates and the like from Wikipedia, so that I don't have to develop all that stuff myself, as well as continuing to develop, update, expand, and document in-house templates and categories, and then start to implement all these updates across the wiki.

Now that I've gotten this first little rant out of the way, are there any questions/comments/suggestions/etc.?
