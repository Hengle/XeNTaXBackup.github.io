- Post Title: .BLB format containing animations Diesel Engine

When checking the files of Wanted Weapons of fate, I found the .blb and .XMB file formats. These are different compared to Bionic Commando and the Payday games, the .blb files contains the animations and the .XMB files are apparently code related to the state machines of the animation. are there any tools or some way to open them or turn them into  a simple format. Can anyone check the files and confirm if they actually contain animations and bones (and in case they do) then how to convert them to fbx or collada or other animation format.

Another Sample file of an idle animation. Hope someone can check in on this. Help would be truly appreciated. I looked and searched a lot for this but only found the .diesel models conversion no luck with animations sadly and the payday games use different animation formats.
