I found [this thread](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?t=93) from a couple years back, and there was a .bms file for the archives in the demo (but not the full version).  I don't suppose there's any chance of ever seeing support for Vietcong's .cbf archives?  Or, at least, support for the demo .cbf archives without needing to register?  I just want to get some of the weapon sounds out, and there doesn't seem to be anywhere else to do it.

Yes, it has been on my to do list quite some time.  But I (and I also believe Watto)  tried but bumped into a limited explanation of the format, that prevends the format to be implemented.   It's just a difficult format.

I realize it's a problematic format, and a couple years later, it's obviously not worth much trouble to deal with, but is there any chance at all of getting ahold of the weapon sounds in the game?  Was there any support for the demo that could be used to get sounds from that and not the full game?

The CBF packages are encrypted and contain also some files compressed with the infamous LZW algorithm.

About a week ago I released a CBF files extractor in case someone is still interested (also the recent Vietcong 2 game uses the same format):

the command-line tool is located to the bottom of the section.
Hope it helps.

Hi mate,

Thanks for the heads up about this - I took a look over your website and I an very impressed - you can do many things that I wish I were able to do  . I hope you stick around here on the forums. You might also be interested in our wiki ([http://wiki.xentax.com](http://wiki.xentax.com)) - it mostly just has information on game archive formats but some things could help you out. Maybe you would like to contribute too where appropriate, and you are free to add links to your tools in the wiki if you wish.

Thanks mate!

WATTO

Indeed, why not sign up and contribute to the Game Resource Archive WIKI?

Thanx a lot guys.
this morning I have already updated the wiki and added some new entries (like the UZ2 and TNTFOLDER files and have uptead Brothers in Arms, FireStarter, HoveRace and Lineage2) and now I'm going to add other 2 games.
And since this seems to be the only archive on Internet for game formats I think that I will stay here for long time eh eh eh.
Yesterday I have already looked in all the forum for archives which use encryption, so if you are aware of games that use it don't hesitate to PM or mail me.
Another idea could be the starting of a thread where we can collect all these encrypted file formats.

Excellent stuff, Bugtest! Thanks for joining the team at the WIKI!

 

Nice idea about the Encryption thread, you want to start one in Code Talk? I think the WIKI could also have a separate section for that.
