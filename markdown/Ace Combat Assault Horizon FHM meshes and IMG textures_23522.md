- Post Title: Ace Combat Assault Horizon FHM meshes and IMG textures

It's possible to unpack the game's QDF archives using ZXstudio's QDF tool
[http://zxstudio.org/blog/open-horizon-downloads/](http://zxstudio.org/blog/open-horizon-downloads/)

/target/model_id/mech/plyr contains the meshes for hero aircraft
/target/model_id/mech/airp/o_* contains the meshes for NPC aircraft
/target/model_id/mech/airp/d_* contains the meshes for destroyed aircraft
/target/model_id/tdb/plyr and airp contains the textures for their respective meshes

I tried using the FHM tool for Mobile Suit Gundam Extreme Vs Full Boost which has the same publisher, but it's not compatible.

The .img textures have DDS DXT4 in their headers but renaming the extension doesn't prove to be a quick fix.

You can get the files for the Tornado Gr4 below if anyone wants to take a stab at it.
