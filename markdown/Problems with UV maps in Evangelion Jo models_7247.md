- Post Title: Problems with UV maps in Evangelion Jo models

Hi, I extracted all gmo files from the Evangelion Jo game, when I view them with mesh2rdmv They look perfect, but when I convert them to smd or obj files the UV maps are messed up, I open the smd files in Milkshake 3d, can anyone tell me what can I do to get the models in the right way?, thank you..

did you use the -flipuv option?

Another thing you might consider is using NOESIS, mesh2rdm's successor.

If you're talking about Noesis: I know that for some models I would have issues using "export from preview" in previous releases.  But I think it should work as long as you pause the animation.
