I need your help guys

As i said in the title, how to extract a non extension files in unity game ? i've been extracting some other unity android game (honkai impact 3, eternal city) in the past using assetstudio and it works just fine, i can grab the mesh, texture2d, audiofiles, etc.

But somehow in this game the tool wont load any assets, is it because its encrypted ? if so, how can i decrypt it, because i really liked song in this game

Please helpme, thank you very much

Download HxD hex editor
Open it, Open the file.
Under Decoded Text you'll read "KuroUnityFS.....5.x", to make it readable you need to delete the "Kuro" part and then the program will recognize it.
Yes you have to edit all the files if you want to open them, to mass edit their header look around for some program or executable that may be used; i know little of those.
