- Post Title: [NintendoDS]Pos and BinA files from Dragon Quest Monsters Joker 2 Professional

Hello everybody.
First, i'm sorry if my english is bad. I'm french.
Second, i come here to search help for Dragon Quest Monsters Joker 2 Professional that i want to translate.
The problems is that i found nothing on internet to edit the files that contains the text of the game. I tried with various hex editor but none worked entirely.It doesn't show any text. Only numbers, random letters or random japanese character.
I hope you can help me. I share two files with the extensions that i'm talking about.
