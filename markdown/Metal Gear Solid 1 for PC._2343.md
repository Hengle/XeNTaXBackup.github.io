- Post Title: Metal Gear Solid 1 for PC.

Hello all. I've searched and browsed through the forums, but am unable to find an answer to what I'm looking for.
I have MGS for the PC and because of it's age, I'm not sure that it would or would not use 3D meshes or just animation.
I've used a few programs to successfully extract the .mgz files (not sure those are even the right ones) and out of them have found some .dar files.
Basically, I'm trying to extract and convert for editing, the mesh for Metal Gear Rex.
I don't know if I'm looking in the right place, looking for the right files, how to extract or convert for editing in any useable format (Deep Ex has a huge library of files it can convert).
Heck, I don't even know if I'm looking at a skinned mesh when I play the game.
Any advice on this would be amazing, or any sources where I may locate a low-poly MG Rex.

Perhaps take a look over here for some informations and further links about MGS. If known already, sorry. Dar format sounds to me rather like still some kind of compressed archive than 3D.

I didn't know wether .dar was a deeper archive or a proprietary 3D model, so your words are helpful.
After your words, I rechecked the .dar files.
You're correct. Therein, I see .pcx files and others, such as .kmd.
.Pcx is self explanitory, while the .kmd aren't as much. I'll keep searching and hope that someone with more info than either of us replies.
Thanks for your direction though. It helped.

Glad to be of help. 
Kmd I found to be : "Tool for visualizing, navigating and querying Metis enterprise models."

Link to Metis http://www.metis.no/ deadKMD is the 3d model formmat for the game yeah.
And DAR is the archieve that holds the PCX adn other files for that scene.
But i dont know noting much about the KMD files other then the fact that they are KINDA liek KMY files(MGS2PC), but the models were too small and didnt seem to hold enuf data for anyone to convert or really understand them well enuf to do anything with them.

If I have an accurate frame to work with, I can inprove the quality of the moidel a bit.
Tried Google. Any idea what I might find that would view and export .kmd files?

I have Absolutly NO IDEA lol.
I can ask Turfster i guess, he already did the MGS2 models and as far as i knw he is now working on the MGS1TS models and MGS3 decryption.
He works pretty damned fast so if i give hima  file from this game then he might be able to convert it.

BUT... i havent heard notihng from him in aaaages, im not even sure if he is still working on solidus either(the name of the MGS tool).

Oh him! Yah, I'd sent him an email when I used Solidus and got in a jam with MGS.
I hadn't thought of sending an example .kmd file.
Do I understand correctly, .kmd is the 3D mesh info for characters, vehicles, etc in MGS?
Just reread some of the posts so much and I think I did more to confuse myself then you guys did straightening me out.

Yes KMD is the MODEL format for the game, that includes Characters,Weapons,all models in the game(even REX).

Im assuming that the KMD files also contain animations.
Because the textures are PCX files.

Make a POST in the MGS2 topic(the one with liek 13 pages) requesting this and maybe he will add it to the next version of Solidus, though i havent spoken to him in some time now he might not even be working on it no more.

Okay I think it's finally sunk in.
After extracting stage.mgz, I get a selection of subfolders.
The example subfolder "s15c" has a selection of files in it.
stg_mdl1.dar is a compression of models.
stg_tex1.dar and stg_tex2.dar are compressions of textures.
In the texture .dar fiiles are the .pcx files you mention for skinning.
In the model .dar is a number of .kmd files and those are the proprietary meshes MGS uses?

Most of the mdl.dar files have .kmd files in them.
Occasionally I get a series of blank entries and sometimes a .oar file.
In the case of s15c, I get "enemy.oar" and some garbled code.

Unfortunately all Google searches for "kmd model", "kmd editor", "kmd viewer", etc get results for Kazaa Media Desktop.
EWWW!

Sorry to be a pesymist here.   
KMD sounds to me like "Konami model". Remember reading once article about some port of japanese PS console game to PC.  

> as it turns out, the software rasterizer is the least of our problems... all I'll say is that spaghetti C and PSX assembly commented in Japanese is not a pretty sight

Ouch. That hurts. Heh.
Oh well. If I can figure out how to open and export it, I'm sure I could clean it up.
A bit.

My Nihongo is pretty rusty......
How'd you learn?
I was happily subjected to it during two amazing visits to Japan teaching ESL.
I'd gladly take yiour translations as i don't trust mine to be any good at all.
I've found, often by accident, that renaming a mesh file to another known extension makes it openable. Often with errors, but sometimes at least well enough to edit and fix.
No luck so far.

If it is just renamed format extension of something more standard in 3D, then format recognition utylities may give you a hint. Try running the content of the file  through TrID (online) :

So me and my friend wanna rip the Underground passage way, (Where Meryl gets shot by SniperWolf)..
I tried ripping the TwinSnakes version but its so messy and it's missing parts..  But I was about to get inside the .dar files for MGS1 Intregal, and found .kmz files But I have no idea how to convert to .obj. I need the stage model for a fandub we're doing for the scene. I tried modeling it, but it's just horrible, does anyone know how to convert .kmd to obj?

How do you use it? It says write path to file, what does that mean?
