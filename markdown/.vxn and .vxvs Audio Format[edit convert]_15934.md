I want to edit the Audio format about the .vxn and .vxvs.

Foobar with vgmstream plugin can play it and convert it to standard .wav PCM format.  Not sure if anything can encode it back to the same format though.

As DKDave said, I searched around and couldn't find tools to allow encoding back to .vxn + .vxvs. My guess is either re-write the decode method to an encoding method (if its losseless) or hope somebody develops a tool for this
