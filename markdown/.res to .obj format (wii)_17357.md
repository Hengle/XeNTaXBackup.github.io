- Post Title: .res to .obj format (wii)

This is a ripped model .RES format, no .BRRES. It also happens with PS3.
How can I extract it?

This is the file:
[https://www.dropbox.com/s/xw1myp3f6rep9](https://www.dropbox.com/s/xw1myp3f6rep9) ... e.res?dl=0

Is not a sound file, 'cause it appears in the /characters folder.
