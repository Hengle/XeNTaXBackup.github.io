First you need to decompress upk files with decompress.exe by gildor. 
Then search google for UPKInOut that will help you to extract and repack texts into the game.

This tool is obsolete and doesn't work with current UPKs.

As long as it works with UPKs from for example Mass Effect 1 which is a pretty old game, or as the topic author stated Batman AA, which also ain't too new, it'll be just fine. I'd like to have it regardless.
