- Post Title: Jurassic Park: Operation Genesis *.tmd model format

Hello all, I'm posting here on behalf of the Modding Genesis fan community to request aid with puzzling out a couple of file formats. This post concerns the *.tmd model files. What is currently known about them can be found at [http://www.geocities.com/andres_james/j ... l%20(.tmd)](http://www.geocities.com/andres_james/jpog/jpog_formats.html?20064#Model%20%28.tmd%29). I currently don't have any sample files to post for examination, so for now only speculation on your part is possible, though when I get samples, I will post them here. The other format is requested in the Graphics formats forum.

If you want/need to contact the fan community directly, they can be reached at the [Modding Genesis forum](http://modgenesis.strategyplanet.gamespy.com/forum/).
