- Post Title: DayZ Standalone character models

So I've been playing around with dayz files and I've been able to extract textures from the .pbo's, however I really want to export the character models in their 'underwear' state. I tried opening the models thru the oxygen 2 programme, however, unlike arma 2, the characters just load as a solid block and come up with an error. So if anyone is interested in helping, I'd appreciate it a lot.
