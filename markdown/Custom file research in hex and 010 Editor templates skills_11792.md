- Post Title: Custom file research in hex and 010 Editor templates skills

I have written an article that should help newbies in reverse engineering and hex research.
Main aim: describe hex research basics and get some skills in 010 Editor templates (really the most useful hex editor).

You may check it here: [http://dageron.com/?page_id=6032&lang=en](http://dageron.com/?page_id=6032&lang=en) 

This article is analytical and written for those who haven’t got enough hex research skills (hope that screens will make process as clear as possible). In order to understand what for 010 Editor templates are created, let’s see one small, but descriptive example and suppose we have a file, which can be a memory dump or a collection of resources (for example, from some videogame), so we need to understand it’s nature and describe it’s structure. As a study case, let’s take as an example small file, which represent a binary version of some directory catalog.
