- Post Title: [PSX] XA Audio Converter

Description:
This tool allows fast and easy conversion of XA files. It converts XA to WAV and WAV to XA. It can also preview Playstation audios in the built-in player. By using this utility you can make dubbing in your language or raplace music and sounds in almost any game.

It was originally a Japanese program by taka2 that was translated into Polish and English by ikskoks. All three versions are included in this archive.

In addition, courtesy of ikskoks, a useful tutorial describing using it in practice can be found [here](http://ikskoks.pl/poradnik-10-jak-stworzyc-dubbing-do-gier-na-konsole-psx/).
