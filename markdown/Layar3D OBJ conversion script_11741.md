- Post Title: Layar3D OBJ conversion script

Layar3D is an augmented reality advertising platform aimed at mobile devices.
The 3D format they use is a direct copy of OBJ, only it's stored in binary form along with material data and textures. Therefore it only seemed normal to make an OBJ converter instead of my usual maxscripts.

The only interesting model I could find was an Audi A6 that you can see in [this clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8AnSYO5aA8).
You have to install the app on your phone, scan the marker linked below, and then look for .dat files in the app cache folder.
