Although I don't have the game to look at files, there a few tools that do xwb and xsb.  Although, these soundbanks change from game to game there are usually similarities.

can you guys help us csx modders out? we use your program full throttle, but its just not enough to actually mod this thing! We need recompiling, probably the most important thing in csx modding, because it takes up to a minute to load a game with a few new models, and always gettin these errors about not being able inject and stuff, just please support recompiling, then i can host examples of my mods, then other people will want to do it like Snowfox   and they will pay for your program, but ive not been able to show them any examples due to the lack of options while modding csx, so please make recompiling for csx!

those file types are universal, not made only for counter strike, not unique, im pretty sure the XDK can do something with these...

Another additional file is XPR, which someone has made an extractor tool for, but no injection. That would be awesome to add!  I can upload a XPR file if necessary, and you can google the tool (XPR Extractor), or find it in the usual locations.

This tool says that it can inject the DDS files into an XPR file -

Also, you will need the DDS plug in for Photoshop to be able to make them.....
