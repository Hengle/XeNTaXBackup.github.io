- Post Title: ACU extract object Chatedral Notre Dame

I am a lover of 3d and especially of Paris and I am extracting the pieces of the Cathedral of Notre Dame, I already have the first floor with the files finished in LOD0 that are of more resolution than the LOD1, but I want to continue extracting the second and third Floor to finish building this monument and the following files do not have the LOD0 termination, it shows strange numbers and "collision material" and I can not record them in * .obj or * .arx. Please someone to help, especially MichaelDarkAngel  Thanks in advance
