- Post Title: requesting help about a .r3t to .dds

its from a game RF Online.

They have used a .r3t format for the file (containing a texture in dds format).

Im  completely sure that  the texture is  .dds - its almost the only texture format the game uses.

Also manually hexing the file header and replacing it with a dds header fro ma similar file resulted in a file i could open - tho the texture itself looked corrupted it had the basic shape of what it should have been.

Im unable to read or find out any other info from the file that would help to convert into a .dds file (and perhaps back).
here is the link to a collection of files (a folder for a lvl 55 spear weapon).
spt files contain the particle color etc info, each being for different upgrade grade.
and 3 files in folders  - possibly particle info etc. but r3t contains a dds texture that i could edit.

Perhaps any of you have more experience with extracting textures this way?
