- Post Title: SSX Tricky music

Using a BIG extractor, I extracted both sets of music (JUKEBOX and MUSIC).

 The MUSIC folder has giant-sized .MUS files, with corresponding .BNK files and some other format too, but the MUS files won't open in AWave or WinAmp, and I don't know just what to convert those massive files TO.

 The JUKEBOX folder has compressed music with "SCH1" as the 4CC header (when I opened it in TextPad as a binary), and I don't know how to convert it to a PLAYABLE format. I know it's compressed because Bonecracker (by Shocore) is about 6.5 MB, and that's roughly the same size as the same track extracted from the SvR .AFS file, so could anyone recommend a decent converter? Even one that converts and decompresses them to plain ol' WAV files.
