- Post Title: Star Ocean 2 PSX file system

I would like to dump this data out, and figured I could do it by just scanning for SLZ's, but then the data is not stored contiguously and there are lots of empty patches of 0's so maybe it would be better to see if an unpacker could be written.

Here is the beginning of the large data file.
I have included all the files from the disc as well.
