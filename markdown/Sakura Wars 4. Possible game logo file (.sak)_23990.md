- Post Title: Sakura Wars 4. Possible game logo file (.sak)

Hey I was exploring the files for Sakura Wars 4 (Simplified chinese) and found the files in the "logo" folder. I think the files contain the logo for the game. Can anyone help me view or turn the logo into a .png Help would be much appreciated.

Those DAT files are standard BMP files, so if you'll change extension from DAT to BMP you will be able to view them in IrfanView.

As for SAK file, it is just raw pixel data for some gameboy image.
You can view it in texture finder without issues
