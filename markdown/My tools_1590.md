I made some conversion tools some in Perl and some in EXE programs. Some are useful for converting the files extracted by XeNTaX and Dragon Unpacker.
 Perl:

 Standalone EXE programs

I also have a program that will reverse RGB to BGR and vice versa in the DDS and RGB 24bit and 32bit files.

ehh, nope. I can I guess, but I hate to muck up your website.

 I have been trying to figure out a way to add them as plugins to your program though. Some day we need to chat on how I can contribute more to the cause

I know you asked this of me before, I would be honored and I will give it a try as soon as I can but with my current state of the internet connectivity it might be more stable if you wanted to host them yourself and link to them on wiki. Who knows tomorrow might find me offline for another 6months to a year.
 I really would like to learn more about unarchiving compressed files since all I can do is extract from uncompressed libraries. I stare for endless hours at compressed files trying to see how you guys do this but it escapes me. Most amazing thing to me is to see you unravel filenames and textures where all I see is garbled digits.

Allright, I'll see what I can do some day, I could host them and then write a small page at the WIKI, for you to expand and update as you see fit. How's that sound?

 Hey that would be great. 

 I'll try to stay plugged in to the web as much as I can and keep the current host but if I get anymore years like the last 2 it will be difficult to maintain a presence.

Hi all,

 I have a couple new extractor tools. Same link as previous post. I just finished Matrix: Path of Neo and Lego Star Wars 2 a while back.

[http://www.spared-life.com/SparedLifeFi ... -Lego2.zip](http://www.spared-life.com/SparedLifeFiles/SLConverter-Lego2.zip)

I finally added to the wiki. I don't think I messed it up too bad

I made an extractor/inserter for all library files that contain complete DDS files (including header) in DXT1, DXT3, and DXT5 formats. It rips the header but not the mips. It does however make a text file that lists the format (DXT), mips, and offset location. The text file will help skinners know if they needs mips and how many and if it's a DXT 1,3,5 when saving the edited file.

 I know of these it works with:

 Prolific Publishing's Goldfish aquarium
 Serene Screen's Marine aquarium
 Lego Star Wars
 Lego Star Wars 2
 Driv3r
 Catwoman

 This should work fine for any game that utilizes uncompressed library files that store complete uncompressed DDS files in the above mentioned format. 

 I had noticed that Serene Screen did not run after editing the texture in Photoshop. It was in the header that the DDS plugin saves the file with. To fix the problem the edited files are reinserted after the header in the library. Making only the raw data reinserted, that's why it will work on most all the games within the previous mentioned parameters.

 If you open a GRA in a HEX editor and search for DDS and it finds the DDS header 44 44 53 20 7C this tool should work.

You bet,

 One of these days I'll figure out how to read indexes. They never make sense to me because they rarely point to the proper offset. Even though there is a filename index on many libraries I still have to rip the graphics by searching for a common string at the start of each graphic.
 This is of course a problem if the only location reference is in the index.

whoa that last generic DDS ripper/inserter I posted was a memory hog (ouch). It wasn't apparant until JP used it on the Lego Star Wars full game 1gb library file with 10,000+ DDS graphics in it.
 Fixed now

 I extracted all files but noticed the dat file was incorrect and fixed it. The corrected version is 1.04a

There seems to be some renewed interest in Tomb Raider Angel Of Darkness so I made a skinning tool. It extracts the skin textures from the CHR or GMX files and re-inserts the custom ones.
