- Post Title: Extrapolating information from game files

Hello,

I'm not fully aware whether or not this belongs in the off-topic section of the forums, but I have a request regarding the extraction of information from your typical online game.

I am not talking about packet sniffing or analyzing, I simply want to read into the game's database files to obtain important information on such things as drop rates, success rates, monster names, exp rates and the such.

I have tried using hex editors to read through these files, I have tried reading through the game's memory, and in neither case could I come up with information that did not seem to be complete gibberish (in the sense that information looks like êAÉ%F¥¾¿DěįǷ instead of actual English).

I am relatively inexperienced in this domain. I do not know much about decoding, decrypting, or decompressing information.

All I would ask is to be pointed in the right direction; given a starting point. I have read through the Xentax guides and found the information very interesting, but I am no closer to obtaining the information I want.

Are there any suggestions on where I should start/sites/guides to look at/programs I should use (preferably newbie friendly)? Or should I just give up ahead of time seeing as I know little on computer science?

Any feedback/help would be appreciated.
