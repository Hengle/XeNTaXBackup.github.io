Here's my simple text export-import tool for the game. It works with the "TEXTS_BASIC.dat" file.

Thx bacter for the tool but anybody can help me to unpack the image .dat files (BUTTONS_SHEET_1, TUTORIALS_SHEET_1...).

I edited 'BUTTONS_SHEET_1.png' but when i launch the game with the edited file this happens:

See the image ->>

[http://i54.tinypic.com/s1j907.jpg](http://i54.tinypic.com/s1j907.jpg) 

When the image is onmouseovered there are white lines and blocks.

I edited the file with Photoshop CS5 normally and there those lines can't be seen. I think that this is from the converting (saving the image) but...

What should i do to save the images correctly and show them in-game normally??

Bacter's tool is only for texts_basic.dat. 
And I had the same problem. I figured it out by merging layers in another image editor (I used Paint Shop Pro, or try GIMP). Don't know why that lines happen or what causes them.

[There is the angry tool 0.10](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/23331377/angry_tool_v0_10.rar).
I don't know how much time it will be accessible to download; I'll try not to forget about it.
