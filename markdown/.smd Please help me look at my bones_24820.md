HI shakotay2：

Thank you for your SMD Dharma, but the bone I generated is wrong, and the angle conversion is not like that...

HI shakotay2：

Thank you for your SMD Dharma, but the bone I generated is wrong, and the angle conversion is not like that...With all rotations 0.0 0.0 0.0 it looks ok so far:

Getting rotations correctly is often a hurdle.

Thank you for your reply. I started to use your 0,0,0, which is also the effect. Later, I converted the quaternion into radians, and he changed like this. In fact, my bone is a mosquito。

HI Durik256：

Thank you for your help. Your output posture is very similar to what I need. He is a mosquito.


In fact, such bones are in the following format, but I can't write scripts. I want to see the bones first according to the *.SMD method of shakotay2.


If it's convenient for you, can you help me?

Thank you for your help!
This time I import the exported FBX file into 3DMAX, and it is directly in a group. It is not as beautiful as noesis. The insect you imported for me is normal. The display of the last two I tried to import into 3DMAX is abnormal!

Thanks for your modification. You can import it this time. The display is normal, but the sub bones are all z-aligned?


 Can you help me fix it? If you can, please help me load the skin, and then I'll study your script.

HI shakotay2

The 1 and 2 represent that the vertex will be affected by several bones, followed by the bone number. Thank you for your attention！

After encountering such circumstance several times, it kinda makes me wonder, do you people ever know anything about respect? Coz stealing code from somewhere and removing the original ownership claim yet without acknowledging the presence of the author, whether intentionally or not, is an act lack of manners.

HI shakotay2

The 1 and 2 represent that the vertex will be affected by several bones, followed by the bone number. Thank you for your attention！I know about those numbers, that's why I wrote "[02 or ] 01 000000xx format again". So there's no reason for you to be mocking.
Also I'm the first one who checked these 02/01 numbers, wasn't it me?  

Let's say with Bigchillghost's words:

HI shakotay2

You are professional！    


I have studied this kind of game engine for a long time, but I can't write plug-ins   I know the data structure.

hello, the original source was indicated as a link to the message in the topic
Seriously, you want a debate of that?

There're two posts I quoted in that previous comment:

Judging by the code structure and the naming of some variables obviously you'd already been taking some reference from my original script.

In the original context you quoted a wrong post and removed my ownership claim from the script and now it seems you've made more modifications to the naming of those variables yet there're still traces of my code.

So tell me, it's it really such a natural to you, to take someone's code and piece together another script claimming it's yours, yet refuse to show any gratitude nor even acknowledgement to the original author? That's your way of being civilized?

If you wanna take all the credits, perhaps you should have done it less nasty.

I did not deny that I used developments from the same topic in which many people participated.
Yet you still didn't acknowledge that it's my script that you've taken. I'm talking about an explicit acknowledgement of using my work here. But if you're just a folk who only takes without thanking the author then there's nothing left to argue about.

HI Bigchillghost，
Your contribution to the game circle is in your eyes. Your script ideas can't be surpassed by everyone. Many 3D games
The data structure is roughly the same. I believe you have learned from your research over the years that you have contributed your AXE artifact to everyone,

Yes, AXE is great. I've tried to analyze it without bones. It's very convenient. I guess this software will also support scripts in the future, so it's a sharp surgical scalpel and a sharp tool for structural analysis!

the texture should be near the model. 
if there is no mesh in .smz then the .ski file must be in the same folder. 
or only the skeleton will be loaded.
