you need the next version of quickbms and version 0.1.4 of [dmc4.bms](http://aluigi.org/papers/bms/dmc4.bms) that at the moment are not available.
I leave this message otherwise I will forgive to do it.

so stay tuned, when I will release the next quickbms you will find also the updated dmc4 script

Ok, will do. Thanks for responding. Turns out the script I'm using right now seems to extract some things correctly, while others are jumbled, so I will look forward to your next release. Nice job btw, your scripts are very helpful!

I don't mean to be impatient or anything, but do you have your new QuickBMS up yet aluigi? The only reason I ask, is because I saw you had the new DMC4 script up, but not the QuickBMS to go with it.
