Lord of shadows was not developed by Capcom, and not by any japanese company.

It was developed in Spain by Mercury Steam studios.

Any hope of you releasing a model extractor/BMS script and a way to convert it to Max/Maya friendly model format?

Szkaradek123,

With your script, I was able to load into blender 2.49 the .sm3 characters from the PS3 version, but was unable to load the XBOX360 .sm3 files.

Since I only have a few PS3 files, and all of the XBOX360 files can you take a look at this .sm3 and possibly modify your script to work with the XBOX360 files as well.

Thanks for all the great blender scripts
