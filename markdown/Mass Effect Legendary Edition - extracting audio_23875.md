- Post Title: Mass Effect Legendary Edition - extracting audio

I paid $60 for the ME Legendary Edition, I'm hoping they remastered the musical score for that game. I have the game on my PC, I just need to know how to extract the audio. There is no clear "music" folder that I can see, most of what could be assumed to be audio appears to be of AFC or PCC type, which I have no way of converting to a listenable format. I would sincerely hope I didn't waste $60 on a game that I can't extract audio from. I already intend to pay $60 for the game on console to play, but spending another $60 on PC if I can't get music files from it would be a waste of $60.

All music can be found on YouTube, both found the OST and the ingame only versions. There is no remaster done on the music, it's the exact same. The best they probably have done is adjusted the compression on some minor parts. This isn't Halo 2: Anniversary where they redid the soundtrack.

By the way, if you spent 60 bucks solely on getting audio, maybe you should figure out before purchasing if anyone has researched on getting the audio off the game?
