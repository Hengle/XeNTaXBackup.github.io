- Post Title: Downloading Models From P3d.in?

Hey all,

There's a model I've been trying to download from P3d.in. I've tried obtaining files from the cache, ripping with NinjaRipper and I'm left scratching my head. I don't even know if I've done either of those properly.

Could I get some assistance? [This](https://p3d.in/k63T7) is the model in question.

I've been able to get the textures, just can't get the model.

The file of this spaceship model: 
[https://p3d.in/static/uploads/7699/0970 ... 3d.r48.bin](https://p3d.in/static/uploads/7699/0970fk63T7.p3d.r48.bin)
I think the vertex coordinates are stored in the first part of this file and the second part for the faces, uvmap...

Thanks for your help. What do I do with this bin file?

It worked! Thank you!

For future reference, how would I go about obtaining that bin file?

Also, seems like I'll have to texture this manually. Is there no way to generate a corresponding MTL?

with firefox> CTRL+MAJ+C > click on network >  reload the page and search the p3d.r48.bin copy/paste the url and download the .bin

For the MTL you have to ask Tosyk the inventor of the python script.

Hello. I got as far as getting a .bin file from the cache using Mozilla. I've renamed it three.js which has turned the file type into a JavaScript file. How do I run the convert_me_back.py file? 

Thanks for any assistance.

Hi Xentax, please tell me why you can't convert the bin file? in the description P3D
convert_me_back.py don't work with this file (in the description not Three.js)  
How P3D convert ? Which soft?
