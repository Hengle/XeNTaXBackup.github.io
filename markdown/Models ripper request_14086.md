- Post Title: Models ripper request

Hi! Since its possible to rip models from Soulcalibur 4. Are there any model rippers that have the tools to rip from this game, or at least know who to get to the root files? I have Noesis and I guess it can open ripped model files SC4. If Noesis can, where are the root files?
