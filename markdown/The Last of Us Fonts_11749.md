That .fnt files were made in BMFont by Angelcode (or in similar application). Original textures were in .tga format as you wrote, but it doesn't mean they are still in .tga, they can be in any other format.
And I don't think that .pak files you provided (btw delete those links, they are against forum rules) contains any picture data, and they are not compressed.

EDIT: It's just a tip, but I think the font textures will be in that biggest .psarc archive, and they will be in DDS (or PNG) format.
