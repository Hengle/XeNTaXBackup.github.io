- Post Title: Request for help with the epf file

I extracted a DAT file.
As a result of extraction, we could find the epf file.
Extract the bmp image file from the epf file.
I was able to modify the image
I want to change the image to epf again.
But I don't know how to convert the epf file.
I'm asking for help.

I'm from South Korea. I used a translator.
Language may be a mistranslation, but I ask for help.
