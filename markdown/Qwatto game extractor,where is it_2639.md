I asked Mr.Mouse awhile back where Watto had vanished to, he said Watto's been busy with university (IIRC). You can find his Game Extractor at [http://www.watto.org/extract/index.html](http://www.watto.org/extract/index.html).

He finished university and got a job involving a lot of computer work and programming. He simply has limited time on his hands for Game Extractor. 
Sort of like me for MultiEx Commander: updates are much too infrequent to my liking, but time is the main issue. You got to focus on that which brings in enough money to support the family, and I would be poor if donations to the MexCom project would have to do that

Aah, so that's what he's up to these days then. Still, it would be nice for him to at least drop by and say 'hello'...
