Has anyone tried to extract and convert models from the game Ride 4?

I am trying to extract archives with UE umodel. But it gives me this error. I tried to install different versions UE 4.18, 4.20, 4.25, 4.26. 4.27, but the error is always the same. Partially extracted only some textures. Objects are not retrieved. 
This is for the version for PC.

I have also uploaded the version for PS4. I was able to unpack PKG. But PAK files can't be unpacked...

Problem solved. I figured it out. I had to use version UE 4.25 and specific Umodel build 1579. Then it works well.
