- Post Title: Watch Dogs Legion - trying to find Bagley voice

Hi everyone,
I used tools found on this forum to extract audio files from Watch Dogs Legion and convert them to ogg format. I'm searching for Bagley's voice but it's nowhere to be found. There are many files extracted and there is still a chance I just haven't found any by chance, but unlikely. Is WDL adding this voice effect over the plain voice of the voice actor? I also found many files with robotic-sounding voice (like those generated by not the best text-to-speech engine) but the tempo and intonation do not match Bagley (or do they?) even then this is not how it sounds in the game. Any thoughts or help to get the voice exactly how Baley sounds like?
Thanks
