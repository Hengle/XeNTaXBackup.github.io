It seems like an archive file, the headers don't match zip, but there are plaintext filenames of the files contained within.  Mainly i want to extract the .visual files so I can import the models using the existing model editor.

Can someone who is good with archives and hex take a look?

Same file is able to be extracted from game client if you don't want to use this one, but requires installation of game and wows unpacker gui.

No idea what assets.bin is for.  Model data is packaged in idx/pkg files.

Thanks, but no.  That unpacks most of the files, but does not unback the assets.bin, which contains the .visual files that tell the model what to do with itself.  With those files, I believe I can import models into the older model importer again, once I put stuff back in the right directory structure.  The tool broke when they moved the .visual files out of the models directory and locked them in this archive.
