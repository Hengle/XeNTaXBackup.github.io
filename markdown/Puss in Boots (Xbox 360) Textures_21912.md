Hi. I am looking at some textures from this xbox 360 game. Extensionless files are the headers and files with ".data" contain the actual image data. Color textures "_c" seem to be DXT1 but they are not coming out perfect. There are some artifacts. I don't know if this is a xbox thing, or something else. I hope someone with more experience can help with it. Samples are attached to the post.

This is what I got with TextureFinder :

artifacts are shown in texture finder because X360 images are big endian.

Oh yeah, makes perfect sense  Should have thought of that. I can just make a quick script for Noesis I guess. Thanks a lot.

here is a quick Noesis python script based on the small sample size.

supports big endian dxt1 and dxt5, top level mip only.
open the *.data file and the script will find the extensionless header file if
they are next to each other.
