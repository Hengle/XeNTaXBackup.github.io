- Post Title: Breath of Fire 5: DQ .emi files extraction

Hi there, i'm new on this site.
I wanted to open BoF:DQ game and see what i can find inside it, before even considering to do something else(aside looking)
So i got MultiEX Commander to deal with .emi extention files, i read some topic of this site
and looks like someone managed to succesfully extract some content from it using the code in this thread:
[viewtopic.php?f=15&t=1984&start=30](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=15&t=1984&start=30)
(they said it works even on BoF:DQ)
So i did the following stuff:
- open MultiEX(version 4.5.1)
- open script window
- copy/pasted that script to extract .emi stuff(created from Mr.Mouse)
- clicked "use on..." button and chose some random emi file inside the game
    (example: <path>\<name of BoFDQ folder>\image\system\bg01.emi )
- note: i don't know what should come out from that, what i imagine it could be is an image file of a background or something
- the thing that comes out is a file called noname1 and its type is "file".
kinda sure i'm doing something wrong here    , could you please help me to figure out what i did wrong and 
how to do that properly?


EDIT: forget what i said, that's just how the code is supposed to work so i didn't mess up during the process.
i opened with hex editor some of the files and i found some interesting data inside them, like game dialogues inside the map files
and that's cool.
Now it would be great if i'd also figure out how to see graphics of the game, but i don't know how...
compressed or not, any help on how to do that would be really appreciated.
