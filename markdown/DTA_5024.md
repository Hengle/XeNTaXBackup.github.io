- Post Title: DTA

HD2 -Sabre Squadron by illusion soft works.

Is any one possible to extract the sabresquadron.DTA for projects. 


I only have a little understanding of the file format.

Can any one extract the file for it to be use by mappers, we want a editor that will help us expand the game...

There is only a good handful of maps for this game and only few mappers make maps from mafia editor and hex editor.


Any chance some one got time to re look and help out..

If possible to extract the dta, i would like to pass the information on to a programmer that would make much use of the information lock inside away.
