The mesh format is the same
The compression is LZHLIB
I can not find the uncompressed size in these files so i can not make a quickbms script.
ma bee luigi can make an implementation of this algo that will not pad 's if you give it a bigger size.

I'll make a build some other time, probably after I shove the LZH algorithm into Noesis so you can just open the czr files directly.
