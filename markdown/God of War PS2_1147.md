I've downloaded God of War, and its got a .pak file. Any suggestions?
I'm quite the neophyte.

Well, I don't have that game myself. Is there a demo around? Or perhaps you can send a part of that PAK file (attach it here) using a good hexeditor (saving just, say, the first 500K and the last 500k of the file). 

So we can have a look-see.
