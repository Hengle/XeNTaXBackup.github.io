- Post Title: Mini Car Racing .dat file

Hi, would like to extract content from this .dat file such as sprite and sounds but can't get it open on Game Extractror and neither dragon unpacker and I was hoping if someone can help here.

The entire file is here: [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qWq3hg ... sp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qWq3hg_tQlkDO1Bkvmn-za3WKJuRrMoL/view?usp=sharing)
