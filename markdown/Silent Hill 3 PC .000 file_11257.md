Hi,
I don't know how to convert the .mpeg back to a .000 file but here's the thing:
On this site [http://www.ctpax-x.org/index.php?goto=f ... 96&lang=en](http://www.ctpax-x.org/index.php?goto=files&show=96&lang=en) I found the Delphi source code of another 000->mpeg converter.
Since I'm not comfortable with Delphi, I ported the code to Java - I though I could then somehow "reverse" the converting process.
Well, I couldn't but maybe someone else can use the code to figure out how to convert the video back to .000

Well, I couldn't but maybe someone else can use the code to figure out how to convert the video back to .000The tool was updated with the C source codes and complete format decryption.
Now you can write a back converter if you want.
