It won't open it. Noesis supports cryengine models until certain version via revelation's plugin. The only way to get models is using a directx ripper (ninja ripper) and I'm not sure it it's gonna work.

Rename the .skin files to .cgf and you should be able to open those in noesis. (checked the Marius file and was able to import the head) Also use DDSunsplit for the textures. Basically open these the way you would crysis 3.

Not until someone makes plugins for those.

Also some files noesis can't read, because of "Duplicate bone names"

Not sure how to preview textures in noesis myself, but that doesn't stop you from previewing in 3DS max. Use ddsunsplit to convert the dds.0 files to workable dds files.

I wrote a Max Script to Batch apply textures to .cgf and .chr models. But I have to take a look at the Ryse format to see if it needs to be updated for it ( I hope to take a look at it soon ).

some of the .skin files don't want to work, you can get the .skinm files which contain the geometry, but no bones.

Yup, you're right! Some models (head as I understand) exist in older crytek format too. But most are in newer, skin files -it's bones only/skinm-models only   I modified my maxscript for crytek to import them, first bones then model - and it seems to work, Boudica's head

Just noticed that the base normal map values are really high (i.e. not 128,128,255). So unless my PS is acting up (I'm pretty sure it isn't) I'm guessing they're stored in linear space and will need converting before using.

Please do not point users how to pirate games. It is not legal and most importantly against the rules.

Remove them.

Hey guys,
Am I the only one having problems to export models from Noesis ?
When I try to export some trees (yeah, I love trees), no file is created. (I tried with obj, fbx ect..)

Maybe it's not possible for some object ? Or I do something wrong ?

Everyone have tutorial ?writing tutorials is a tedious task.

You might use hex2obj (view link in my sig) to get an insight into the model format:



ro_gatehouse_arch_wall_a-cgfm.jpg (86.82 KiB) Viewed 390 times



Then it's not too hard to write some lines to import the model into Noesis or 3dsmax
if you have some knowledge in Noesis python or 3dsmax script.

I don't have a tutorial, but I have written a script for my specific needs, to import chr, cgf, cgfm etc..., specifically for Ryse, but I plan to expand it to all games and assets.
You can test it out, and try looking at the code if you want to.
Use it on your own risk, full with bugs most certainly.

I have only tested the script in 3DS Max 2017
See a movie here on how to use it [https://youtu.be/GZ9KhEezDMo](https://youtu.be/GZ9KhEezDMo)

Shit, I deleted RYSE the other day! 
But this is exciting, I must re-download to test this one.
Does it work with static as well or just skeleton for now?
Thank you a lot.

Sure, np
It works with static as well.
Use the "LOAD CryFile" button to load static assets.

Hey! I finally managed to test it!
Great results so far, but I haven't been able to get the skeletal meshes or the textures just yet. I'm probably doing something wrong.

I got this from the listener when trying to load any CDF:

```
(CDF_Attribs nTagString:"Model" idx:0 attribName:#("Material") attribVal:#("Objects/characters/animals/snake/snake_Mat.mtl"))
(CDF_Attribs nTagString:"ShapeDeformation" idx:0 attribName:#() attribVal:#())
(CDF_Attribs nTagString:"ShapeDeformation" idx:0 attribName:#() attribVal:#())
(CDF_Attribs nTagString:"ShapeDeformation" idx:0 attribName:#() attribVal:#())
(CDF_Attribs nTagString:"ShapeDeformation" idx:0 attribName:#() attribVal:#())
(CDF_Attribs nTagString:"ShapeDeformation" idx:0 attribName:#() attribVal:#())
(CDF_Attribs nTagString:"ShapeDeformation" idx:0 attribName:#() attribVal:#())
(CDF_Attribs nTagString:"ShapeDeformation" idx:0 attribName:#() attribVal:#())
(CDF_Attribs nTagString:"ShapeDeformation" idx:0 attribName:#() attribVal:#())
```


And... how do I get the textures? 
It seems it is auto, but I'm probably missing something.

```
matDB: D:\Ryse - Son of Rome\mat.txt
```


And nothing happens.

If you can help me out, that would be great, but thank you a lot already!

Have you downloaded the lastest attached version?
If not, please first do that and test it...

The version you have, most likely looks for the .mtl in a database I used for testing.
The updated version uses the asset resource lists that ships with the game.

In order to make them available, ***YOU HAVE TO ALSO UNPACK*** the GameRyse\Levels .pak archives

Thanks!!
I have unpacked everything now.
Will it search under \GameRyse\Levels\Colosseum (for example) or I have to do anything else?

Also, the script now says: Cannot find scriptpath, cannot continue, aborting!
No matter what I try,

I cannot seem to figure out where Marius' sword (and the rest of the roman swords) are located in the models and keep getting access denied from the extractor. If anyone happens across the sword models could they possibly post them here? If not I understand. Thank you.

Download the latest fix, it contains some important bug fixes, such as .mtl name reference bug fix.
The resource lists method will search every level asset available automatically. It will look inside the levels folder for the resource list for the required resource. This is not the most optimised way, as there are assets in the lists we are not interested in, and should skip unconditionally, but for now, it is sufficient.

Delete the "cryimport_v3.ini" in "\Users\<yourusername>\AppData\Local\Temp\" and then start the script again

Hi joqqy,
Thank you very much for the constant updates!

However, after the first version, I still cannot make it work here.
This version asks for the path, I apply them correctly and it says it can't find the includes - which is very odd.
I tried copy/pasting them on the same ui_.ms folder, but then again I get the "Cannot find scriptpath, cannot continue, aborting!".

Did you delete your old "cryimport_v3.ini" in "\Users\<yourusername>\AppData\Local\Temp\" ?

The includes must be kept in the \include folder
That is, they will not be found if placed inside the same dir as ui_.ms

The folder structure inside the zip file must be kept as is.

When the setup asks you for the script path, you must choose the folder where ui_.ms is located, which also must have the "include" folder.

3ds Max version should be 2017

Except for the 3ds Max 2017 - mine is 2016 - everything is set as the above.
Usually, this is not a problem. Should I update and try?

I deleted the .ini - Unzipped, left as it is - Ran the script, set the folders.
Right after I set it, it says "Cannot find scriptpath....."

If I check the .ini, everything is correctly set:

[paths]
g_dirpath=C:\Ryse - Son of Rome\GameRyse
scriptRoot=C:\mypathgoeshere\Desktop\CryRyseImport
g_includePath=C:\mypathgoeshere\Desktop\CryRyseImport\include

One other thing:
If I put the ui_.ms from the first version on the last version, the script runs. (probably all buggy, haven't tried)

Yes please, update to 3ds Max 2017.

I tested the scripts on a 2015 installation, and they failed, as you describe.
So until (and if) I look at what has changed since max 2016 or earlier - Since I wrote the scripts on and for Max 2017 - my suggestion is you update to 2017 and try again.

So, download the attached scripts, which have some modifications - delete the ini file again, and run the scripts on 3ds Max 2017.

I am glad to help.

Updating to 2017 solved the issue! 

If you have the time, please, explain a bit more in depth how to get the textures?
I suppose I have everything extracted, but I still don't get the textures assigned or converted (I think).

Great news is everything else is working. Even the skinned meshes are working great. 

Thanks a lot - one more time!

I suppose I have everything extracted, but I still don't get the textures assigned or converted (I think).

Great news is everything else is working. Even the skinned meshes are working great. 

Thanks a lot - one more time!

Good 

About the textures:

I assume you have extracted ALL level .Pak archives and left the folder structure intact/unchanged.

I also assume you have ***unsplit*** the .dds files?
If not, you must unsplit them first using the dds unsplitter, which you can find through a simple search engine search ("ddsunsplit"), or even in here, (sorry I do not have a direct link).

> Hi joqqy,
Thank you very much for the constant updates!

However, after the first version, I still cannot make it work here.
This version asks for the path, I apply them correctly and it says it can't find the includes - which is very odd.
I tried copy/pasting them on the same ui_.ms folder, but then again I get the "Cannot find scriptpath, cannot continue, aborting!".

If I get the importer to work again, I'll surely do this for you.

That would be awesome! Thank you so much!

Great

As a note, these tools are highly *WIP* and I do add features when time allows me.
Therefore, you will most certainly encounter bugs that may have been fixed in a newer version, that isn't public.
Next on the *TODO* queue is the Animations as well as refining the material assignment as to more closely reflect the CryEngine Shader structure , and maybe even add a directX shader option.

Edit: Speaking of updates, I have just attached a very important update with lots of fixes!

Thanks!

It is working very well, at least here! 
Are you planning support for other games? Animation is already a big thing.
It seems like each new CryEngine game uses a slightly different format. Must be really hard to keep track.

Oh, one thing I noticed (didn't try FixV3 yet) is that on 3ds Max .ini (AppData\Local\Autodesk\3dsMax\2017 - 64bit\ENU), the scripts folder was changed to the CryRyseImport script folder.
I didn't test much - but it seems to lead to a crash when running other scripts.

CryTek has a habit of abusing its code, so yes, it can be frustrating at times.

Hi,joqqy, this is Refoxo, a very green rookie here, I wanted to extract chr files from Ryse, but when I try to run the MXscript, it tells me that it can not find HEADER.ms. 

I checked the include folder, and HEADER.ms is right there.

I also browsed other posted in this thread; I saw a solution mentioned an ini file that includes the path of folders, but when I go to the "\Users\<yourusername>\AppData\Local\Temp\" folder, I can not find the INI file at all.

Here is what I did,

1. Download the script.

2. Launch my 3DMAX 2017

3. Exactly follow what you did in the youtube video tutorial.

Then things went south, in your video, u can see a new pop-up window that allows u to import the chr files. But what I can see is an alert window saying can not find HEADER.ms, then the script editor pop up saying line 207 has errors.

Is there anything I missed? should the unzipped script be placed into some specific folder to get it working? 

Thank u for writing this fantastic script and reading this rookie question.

Looking forward to ur reply:)

Refoxo; Same thing happens to me.
What does the trick for me is copying the contents of the include folder on the ui_.ms folder... then everything loads fine.

Thanks for looking! Sadly my best guess is one of the Objects Paks, I was gonna look in ObjectsChar-part1 first and branch out but I have never been able to extract the paks. thats where my permissions are blocked.

i don't want unnecessary crossposts but since your script is called "CryEngine Importer"
and you mentioned you'd like to support more games, here's the most recent one (apart from "Wolcen").

some files load, some don't (well most don't) -if they do, then without skeleton though. (already set up the path to skeletonlist.xml file)
so, if you feel like supporting that one aswell, i'd like you to reply at the Homefront thread, to keep this

Hey joqqy,

Your toolset looks very promising! I tried it out and noticed that skin weights are not working correctly yet?

Also do you have any ETA on when you can load animation tracks ? Awesome work, keep it up!

Hi,

Unfortunately, I do not have an ETA on the anim tracks.
I have already implemented the animation, but it is too buggy to release yet.
I actually didn't intend this to be a toolset, but just wrote it for my limited needs - but I might expand on it as I devote my free time to it.

The skin weights work well for me. Some skin meshes are hi res proxy meshes, that do not have any weight info, controlled by lower res proxies instead.
Not all the skin features of the CryFile format are imported back to max - just the basic weights and bones. Advanced features such as spherical skinning and dual quaternions etc are yet to be implemented - if ever.

Here is an update:

Thanks for all the updates, I really love that.
I somehow managed to get the textures working (I forgot to unpack the dds0.pack, my bad), however I can't really have them showing up on 3dsmax. I'll keep trying to understand what could be the issue.

Hey folks, first off, thanks a bunch for all the tools and resources here.
Took me awhile to figure some things out but got the max script working.
The main problem I am having is extracting all the PAK files.
Some of them dont seem to want to unzip, like I have the zip files there but they return errors when unzipping with winrar, and thats even with copying them to c: first so file name isnt too long.
Some of them extract fine, but others just dont.
So my question is, for this to all work do we need to actually unzip every folder after weve run the pak extractor? none of the ones gameryse/levels will unzip, and neither will the scripts.pak.zip.

cheers in advance, hopefully someones still keeping an eye in here

UPDATE: Ive extracted all that I could, and got it working to some extent, but it wont load up anything when I try to load character files, I can only use the cryfile function for statics. I really wanted this to get the full meshes and bones of characters but not having any luck, and going down the old way of using Noesis only seems to export polygons without bones unless its a head.
Any help is appreciated.
Using MAX2017 and the most recent set of scripts by joqqy, I had to copy the contents of the include folder into the root folder where ui.ms is kept, only way I could get it to work otherwise I just got the same script errors that people had mentioned above.

Hello, I can not use the pulled out models and textures in the engine, what do you think with what it is related

I open the pak archives with the help of 7z, then drag and drop the files into the CryEngine, but he does not see them

downloaded previously archived archives with models and textures, he also does not see them

Here is a screenshot of what comes out [https://pastenow.ru/b277e0ec200ccaa99bee4df8380fe2e0](https://pastenow.ru/b277e0ec200ccaa99bee4df8380fe2e0)

Hello!
Thank you very much for the script!
Everything works perfectly!

There is a question, please help with it.
Is it possible to import the entire location, rather than its individual elements? for example coliseum?

Thanks a lot for your help.

Did you get .cgf and .cdt files after extracting ? If yes run the script in 3ds and make as follow:

I can't seem to get the 3ds Max script to work correctly. Does anyone know how to extract the contents of the ryse .pak files? I tried using the Crysis 3 PAK extractor on ObjectsChar-part0.pak but the .zip I got was mostly corrupted. I can only extract 60% of the .zip before it returns an error, but the files I need are still in there.

If anyone can either tell me a working way of extracting that file, or upload the contents of ObjectsChar-part0.pak, that would be greatly appreciated

EDIT: Turns out I was using a broken version of the Crysis 3 tool. [viewtopic.php?t=11021](https://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?t=11021) works fine, I got all the files I need now.

Hey, i'm also very interested in the Ryse Son of Rome models. I want to use them for wallpaper creation.

I've read through this thread and here is my basic understanding summarized:

- I need to extract the .pak files
- I can then use this skript to export cgf and cdt files into 3DS Max

Questions: 
- The .rar files which are provided here, are these already the *correctly* extracted files of the characters? I tried to open them in CryEngine and didn't get any correct import.
- Does the exporter work for all the files ? Every asset like trees, weapons and so on?
- Also does anyone already have FBX Versions of the Characters / Animations? I would love to get them and skip all the export / extract work

Which .rar files ? The best would be to extract the data yourself. 
I extracted weapons, statues, characters/animals with their skeletons, textures so everything should be extractable... even trees.

Damocles, were you able to successfully import the character models along with their heads in the same scene? I seem to have a problem where the head ends up being in the wrong position and I am not sure if it's an error on the toolside. Wondering if you had any success importing a full character model.

Everything was well positioned, maybe it's a scale problem.
