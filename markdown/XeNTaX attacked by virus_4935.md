XeNTaX attacked by virus
August 28th, 2010 by Mr.Mouse and Craptain

If you wondered why we were down, we suffered an attack by a bot. The last few days our host and us worked hard to remove the infection. We will spend some more time to update the code to latest versions as we go. Sorry for the inconvenience.

Webmaster note: We were hit by a virus called Gumblar. It was a more sophisticated virus than usual. It used the password stored in the scp client of one of our webmasters to gain access to our server. Once it had access, it added obfuscated and encoded javascript to all index.html, index.php, etc files, in order to spread the infection.

If you have visited the xentax main site or any of the xentax subdomains from the 25th of august to the 28th, it’s probably a good idea to run a virus scanner. If you’re a webmaster who stores ftp or scp passwords in a local client, check your site’s source code for suspicious scripts.

We are still cleaning up this shit, and are taking this opportunity to upgrade our forum and blog software as well. We will be busy with this at least until sunday, because as usual real life gets in the way: a friend of ours is getting married today.
Sorry for the downtime and the inconvenience it may have caused.

Final edit: The javascript exploits a weakness in adobe acrobat reader and flash, probably only in Windows. So if you run Linux or other Unix clones, you get to be smug and self satisfied that this particular virus doesn’t target you. If you run OSX you can remain clueless about this whole conversation.

I was noticing the javascript there during those days. Nod32 kept saying it was blocking the connections. Lucky me right?

Lol I've had nod32 for about 3 years now and never once had a virus get through. I like it cause it doesn't bog down your computer like those other ones do. I need my computer's proformance for getting good FPS in pcsx2

I don't think there was a virus that is downloaded on your PC. It's more likely a session/cookie stealer or something.
Anyway, if someone can provide me with a sample (exe,dll,ocx,sys, etc.) i'll be happy to reverse engineer it (that's my main hobby these days ).

Yes U're right, I ran a full scan and nothing stood out.
It seems to hack FTP account throught filezilla to propagate throught javascript, 
I checked my website and no javascript was added,

Anyway, if someone can provide me with a sample (exe,dll,ocx,sys, etc.) i'll be happy to reverse engineer it (that's my main hobby these days ).

It was almost certainly [Gumblar](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gumblar), based on de-obfuscating the obfuscated javascript which was inserted on numerous pages. Maybe not a virus, true, but still some type of malware.

It's worth noting that people with properly-upgraded Windows systems and Acrobat/Flash installations may not have had anything to worry about, but you should still run a virus scan just in case (this is one of the basic maintenance tasks you should be regularly running anyways).

One last note, we don't load any scripts, images, or other resources from external URLs (to the best of my knowledge; there may be a couple of images on the wiki loaded from Wikimedia Commons), so you should be able to safely block any such resources from loading.

Looking at it again, it's an issue back in 2008, so I'm not sure how relevant it is now.  Working in Chrome, the button functions as desired.  We're still looking into it.

The button works in the subsections, like [here](http://forum.xentax.com/viewforum.php?f=26), but doesn't work on the [main forum index](http://forum.xentax.com). I'm pretty sure it's not a browser issue. Tried it myself on Chrome, same result as in Firefox.

Looks like there is a very recent debate as to how this button should ultimately function:

Turns out our computers were clean, or at least a multitude of scanners found nothing. 

But whatever it was and where it came from, it injected the sites pages with this :
[script.zip](https://xentaxbackup.github.io/file/3391_script.zip)

I didn't notice anything? What happens if you visit a site that's infected with it?
And what about the pdf etc. stuff? xentax doesn't use anything like flash, pdf...

Thanks, but i've already got this... it just do a document.write('<script type="text/javascript" src="URL SNIP"> </script>')
Then from URL SNIP we had similar script that do a document.write with script again, this time to something like URL SNIP, and there was only a redirect to google.com   
That's why i've said that this is probably only a logger.

Anyway, if someone got the virus, i'll be happy to play with his bits'n bytes. 

@Rheini i've seen similar javascript exploits like this one, that redirect the user to a PDF document with exploit in it. And if you already have installed acrobat reader, that is exploitable (old version etc), you get infected.

Same on Google Chrome. I suspect the browser vendors are much slower to remove attack sites from their blacklists than they are to add them (a policy that makes a lot of sense from a security standpoint, regardless of whether it irritates webmasters of infected sites).

Actually, in IE6 I get no warning, and when I check the source it is free of any malicious scripts. So the site is clean, but the browsers have still blacklisted it.

Yes, true. But we lack members that are willing to become php programmers, still looking for those. Then I'll have to do it myself, and I simply lack time. If you know of anyone that wants to join and maintain the code, then let them step forward.

Yesterday the Game File Format Central was attacked. We are working to fix that one as well. Seems we either have some enemies, or these bots get advanced. In any event, I hope those who are responsible, either for creating the bots or for directing a targeted attack die in the most horrible way possible.

Oh, I hadn't seen the post earlier about needing php help. Do you still need help in that area? I have no experience with phpBB, but plenty of general php+mysql experience, so just let me know.

Edit: Oh and oasis.xentax.com has been unflagged for a while now, if anyone still sees the message there is something wrong with your badware caching mechanism. Not sure if that's part of the web content cache, restarting Firefox or clearing cache data would probably fix it though.

More likely, it's somebody who's had a bad experience on the forums here; there's been more than one extremely messy banning just in the time I've been around.

I just noticed the problem with the wiki, I hope it'll be solved with no big data loss. Also looking forward for the sonofabitch who hacked the wiki to die, as I was in need of consulting some GRAF's. He made me lose much time reverse engineering already done work.

Anyway, keep it going, try to ignore this loozers attacks and shield up the website.

Best regards!

The answer is actually quite simple. The site was hacked by a bot that search for vulnerabilities thru search engines as google/bing/yahoo/whatever.
Most of these bots just try to exploit the system so they can use the host for further (for example DDoS) attacks to other sites.
Best way to protect yourself from attacks is to watch for the latest system updates, and patch your forum/wiki on time.
I'm a PHP programmer myself, and i can help you with some advices, but the sad truth is, i'm also too lazy and bored from PHP coding to handle the forum/wiki support myself.

As I understand it, the wiki attack was unrelated to the forum/website one; it was just a matter of unfortunate timing. At any rate, MediaWiki has always been quite hardened against attacks (it has to be, to be good enough for one of the Top Ten websites); I suspect (having absolutely no data to actually back it up) that the attack may instead have exploited an extension.

Yes, everything's fine now; this was resolved months ago.
