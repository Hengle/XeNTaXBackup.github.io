Hey.
I managed to open the RPF archives of RDR.
The creator's statement of the tool I used is:

> And for anyone wondering why a lot of the filenames are missing for RDR and MC this is due to names being stored as hashes instead of strings as in GTA IV Archives, this means its a lot harder to work out the original filename hence why a lot are just displaying an 8 character hash.

But...
How to resolve this?
I need to understand the system. If I do it's no problem for me to fix all filenames.

Thank you guys!
If you need some screenshots, I can hand them over. I can also show you the source code and stuff like that

There is really no way around it except if you find the hash algorithm and make some kind of database that contains the hash and string (filename), but there is no other way that I can think of in the moment.

I'm in a good contact with some other modders like Alexander Blade and NTAuthority. They are helping me and I guess I'll be able to fix this issue soon.
