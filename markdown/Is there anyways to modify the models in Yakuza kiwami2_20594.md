- Post Title: Is there anyways to modify the models in Yakuza kiwami2

I have the toos to unpack the the gmd files into Ascii then view it in noesis then export it as obj and it looks modifiable in blender. However is there any way to repack the model back to the gmd file readable by the game?

Not only that its not possible via your gmd->ascii->obj because it looses its needed information to keep file intact, for static might work not for characters though, but currently there is no way to do that, I doubt anytime soon someone might start reversing the format for import back in-game.
