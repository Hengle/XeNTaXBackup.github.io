- Post Title: Software rasterizer c++ question/help + is there a discord server for computer graphics?

Hello eveeyone

I'm studying the graphics pipeline and by doing so I'm writing a software rasterizer for it, but I got quite stuck and was wondering if anybody around here could help me, either by being open to having a chat in discord or through linking me some good sources to look at , or maybe even a tutorial? I couldn't find much out there myself, but maybe I'm looking in the wrong places so I figured to ask it here.

Also is there a discord group related to this reddit or graphics programming in general?
