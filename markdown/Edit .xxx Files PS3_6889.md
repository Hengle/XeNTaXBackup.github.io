Hello friend,

So that I know, the problem is how long it takes, is the translation of the SAW within the various texts. Xxx, files are 125 and some files have more than 10 texts inside.

it takes too long to be edited, and as I know pc's like an editing tool I was wondering if someone could help me with this.

You mean as in [Unreal Engine 3 Package](http://www.fileinfo.com/extension/upk) files? The [UDK](http://udk.com/) can edit those.

A guy from a group of translators made ​​a tool that shows only the text you edit there and he always saves the same amount of characters, I'm trying to do with him if he can help me.

I also do with Gildor.
