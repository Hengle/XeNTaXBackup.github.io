Hey, I'm new here and thought I might as well have a go at requesting something, cheers to all the hard work thats been done with other games as it's bene a big help.

Anyway, my request is:

World Tour Soccer - PSP  .CON Files

I've enclosed a file which I'm hoping is how it's meant to be, if not just let me know and I'll try and sort it.

Thanks in advance

Sorry, I'm not one for normally double posting but I was just wondering if there is any chance in this actually happening or if the file uploaded isn't right at all?

Once again, sorry for the double post.

Hi mate,

I took a look at it - but I don't think I found any directory in the archive at all. It does look like an archive though, so not all hope is lost.

If you could, take a look in the same directory as the archive for any small files with the same name but different extension. These files will probably be quite small ( <100kb )  . For example, if the archive is called archive.con , then we are looking for small files called archive.idx, archive.dir, or something similar.

If you find any of these files, please post them here.

Thanks.

The file was tifpspdata.con, I've also found a file called tifpspdata.toc which I'll post.

Oh and I thought I might let you know that the original .con is nearly 500mb which is the only file even over 1mb so it must contain a lot of things.

Hey,

Sorry this thread never showed up in my "unread" messages list so I never actually saw the file you posted above  - I have now downloaded it and will have a look over the next few days.

Sorry for the trouble

Hi again,

I have looked at the file and was able to write a plugin for you - hopefully it will work with the actual archive without a problem.

To use, just unzip the attachment into your plugins directory of Game Extractor, then restart the program.

I would have had this too you last night but for some reason my network decided to stop working  . I will also look into writing a MexCom script for you if you would like it.

Good Luck!

Scrap that, got it working now. It works but it doesn't seem to extract everything in the game, leaves out quite a lot of data. The CON is 469MB but the extracted files only come to 272mb. And the problem is its the ones I'm wanting to use which dont show.

Hmm OK, I guess I will need to look at that a little more  - not sure why that is happening though. I certainly didn't expect this - will see what I can do and will get back to you about it if I can somehow rectify the problem.

I'm guessing you were unable to make any improvements on the .con plugin? Thanks for all your input anyway, not many other people would create plugins for the general public.
