- Post Title: Killzone 2 - .core files bms script?

hello,
i have been trying to extract models from killzone 2 for a long time (renderdoc is successful but no uvs) so im turning to a quickbms script.
using these scripts 
```
# script for QuickBMS http://quickbms.aluigi.org

comtype lz4
idstring "\x83\xc1\x10\xcb"
get CHUNK_SIZE long
get SIZE longlong
getdstring DUMMY 0x10

get NAME basename
get EXT extension
string NAME p "%s_unpack.%s" NAME EXT

xmath CHUNKS "SIZE / CHUNK_SIZE"
if SIZE % CHUNK_SIZE
    math CHUNKS + 1
endif

savepos TMP
xmath OFFSET "TMP + (CHUNKS * 4)"

log NAME 0 0
append
for x = 0 < CHUNKS
    get CHUNK_ZSIZE long
    if CHUNK_ZSIZE == 0 # ???
        math CHUNK_ZSIZE = CHUNK_SIZE
    endif
    if CHUNK_ZSIZE >= CHUNK_SIZE
        log NAME OFFSET CHUNK_SIZE  # ???
    else
        clog NAME OFFSET CHUNK_ZSIZE CHUNK_SIZE
    endif
    math OFFSET + CHUNK_ZSIZE
next x
append

```


```
# script for QuickBMS http://quickbms.aluigi.org

get ARCHIVE_NAME basename

get INFO_SIZE long

        math FLAGS = NAME_OFF

        goto NAME_OFF MEMORY_FILE
        get NAME string MEMORY_FILE

            if EXT == "core" && ARCHIVE_NAME == "psp"
                goto OFFSET
                get ZERO long   # probably XSIZE64
                get XSIZE long
                reverselong XSIZE
                math OFFSET + 8
                math SIZE   - 8
                clog NAME OFFSET SIZE XSIZE
            else
                log NAME OFFSET SIZE
            endif
        endif
    prev CUR_ENTRIES
    goto BCK_OFF MEMORY_FILE2
endfunction

startfunction HANDLE_PACK_NUM
    xmath PACK_NUM "(FLAGS >> 23) & 0x1f"
    getarray LAST_PACK_NUM 0 0
    if PACK_NUM != LAST_PACK_NUM
        putarray 0 0 PACK_NUM
        get EXT extension
        if PACK_NUM == 0
            string TMP p "%s.%s" ARCHIVE_NAME EXT
        else
            string TMP p "%s%02d.%s" ARCHIVE_NAME PACK_NUM EXT
        endif
        open FDSE TMP
    endif
endfunction

```


however, these 2 scripts have proven unsucessful, so im turning to the community for help. any other way to extract this model? samples are available in this drive [https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/ ... sp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_eSSwhZo9uGjfFLC9JulvovGDfUl1xD8?usp=sharing)
please pm me if you have any questions, or reply to this post.

im aware that one particular user (luxox18) manage to extract various models from the game, and im trying to replicate what he did however i just cant find enough information. im guessing this has to do with my experience too (not very experienced)

with renderdoc, after stretching and deleting double vertices, you can get something like this:[https://imgur.com/a/B0eYITP](https://imgur.com/a/B0eYITP)
but the problem is the uv's...[https://imgur.com/a/XseS3Ha](https://imgur.com/a/XseS3Ha)
so thats one of the main problems. however renderdoc does give you the textures (model textures, normal maps, etc)

please do correct me if im wrong, but i think i found the start of vertices [https://imgur.com/a/lWzepOt](https://imgur.com/a/lWzepOt)
and the end of vertices [https://imgur.com/a/olpCdJV](https://imgur.com/a/olpCdJV)

some (a lot of) lines above we have what i assume are face indices (start) [https://imgur.com/a/vKeU2zo](https://imgur.com/a/vKeU2zo)

i will definitely need some help here    so again, please do correct me if im wrong.

edit1: also im unsure if its data type is sequencial or blocked (seperate and structured, respectively)

Hi,
you can always use VB, "blocked", "sequential" is obsolete since VB with an FVFsize of 12 (for floats) is the same as sequential. (I left "sequential" in the tutorial because of educational reasons only).

Now for the vertex start, you're pretty close. Problem is that none of the face indices blocks I tested did fit.
Here's some H2O examples (load model file (once), then a H2O file. Press "go1" and adjust vertex count, if required (scroll down in left lower listbox for found vertex count) before pressing the "mesh" button):

i have been messing around with the values. so, assuming the vertex data pos. is correct, i need to find the correct face indices and figure out the VB block size?
also im sure that it is big endian (ps3 and xbox 360 use big endian, while next gen consoles and windows use little endian if im correct)

btw: you can use +/- buttons to change "startaddress of vertices", then press "mesh". Current delta is 0x100.

alright, i still havent gotten a decent point cloud, so i guess its just a matter of time until i get a decent one.
i will be in touch.

Sadly I have no idea what the problem could be nor the time to dig deeper (intruder, 3 point clouds added):

I have no idea why those face indices at 0xdc628, 0xe0640 or 0xe4658
DON'T fit. Really hate it. 

0xe8670 comes close, but still weird.

Well, finally. One of about 25 sub meshes of "intruder". Not much better than with auto created FIs (see above). Looks like another tri strips algo is required, had to erase dozens of superfluous faces:

(aerial view, face indice block starting 0xE8670)

from what im seeing here, i guess that each of the face indices groups are tied to different vertex groups, if you get what im saying (correct me if im wrong)
i will try to "match" the correct face indices to the correct vertex groups. Still, i guess its more complicated than that xD
by the way, do you have any idea of the cause of the deformation?

> i will try to "match" the correct face indices to the correct vertex groups. Still, i guess its more complicated than that xD
Simply search for 010000000000000000000000000000000000 to give the intruder file a structure. 4th find: 0x1BA5D -> start of vertex block: 0x1BA72
You'll get 25 blocks that way. 
Now find the suiting face indices blocks. That's how I'd do it.

> by the way, do you have any idea of the cause of the deformation?Which "deformation"? The additional (wrong) faces? Similar problem as here, probably:

As I wrote, slightly different tri strips algo required,  other than the one I use (but a, b read from data, not preset):

Maybe the one from Noesis could do but the formula is lost in my notes/old PC, whatever.

(If you know python you could try it out for yourself using noesis.RPGEO_TRIANGLE_STRIP.)
nope, problem not solved:

Maybe I should remove the lots of doubles (1665) first?
(Or the indices are meant to be used differently, indirect or so?)
