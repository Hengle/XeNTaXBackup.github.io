- Post Title: How can I use 3D Ripper DX with Train Simulator 2020?

I'm working on some GameDev projects involving trains and I bought Train Sim 2020 (and some DLC) for research.

My project will be made from scratch in Unity, but I wanted to extract some models from TS2020 just to get a better feel for the scale and proportions of modern trains (no extracted resources will be used in my own project).

I'm running Windows 10, but TS2020 uses DirectX9, and so should work with 3DRipperDX.

I can launch TS2020 (32 bit) with 3DRipperDx in full-screen and have built a 'route' scene with my target trains. enter image description here

While in TS2020, I can toggle the 3DRipperDX 'wireframe' and 'textureless' modes, but I can't seem to get it to trigger the geometry capture. When I press the currently assigned 'Capture Key', absolutely nothing happens.

I've rebound capture to the F keys available (one by one, restarting TS2020 each time), and no dice. Interestingly, F11 and F10 seem to retain their original functions (Wireframe / No Texture modes) despite being rebound, and through subsequent reboots.

Can anybody tell me how to make 3DRipperDX behave normally (and dump the onscreen geo), or can anybody tell me how I can extract reference models from the TS2020 assets? Note that the Blender 'Briage' import addon will not import the current TS2020 file format.

Any advice appreciated - many thanks in advance!
