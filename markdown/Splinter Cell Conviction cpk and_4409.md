Normally Ubisoft uses a own audio compression.
Except in AC2 it uses riff vorbis and in Rayman Rabbid it uses wma riff

Zenchs decoder doesn't support splinter cell conviction, conviction uses a mix of interleaved vox/ogg/pcm.

Hi guys, sorry that I haven't been around for so long. It looks like these files use a similar type of interleaved stream. Shouldn't be too difficult to add to DecUbiSnd.

Again my apologies for not getting to this sooner, it shouldn't have taken so long. Well, anyways, I updated the [original post](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?p=26497#p26497) (currently version 0.64).

Thanks so much for this tool Zench - it worked perfectly on Windows XP. I'll organize the files and post my rip on ffshrine forums ([http://forums.ffshrine.org/showthread.p ... ost1448949](http://forums.ffshrine.org/showthread.php?p=1448949#post1448949)) and the official Splinter Cell board ([http://forums.ubi.com/eve/forums/a/tpc/ ... 5301025048](http://forums.ubi.com/eve/forums/a/tpc/f/2771048463/m/5301025048))
