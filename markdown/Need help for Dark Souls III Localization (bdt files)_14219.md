- Post Title: Need help for Dark Souls III Localization (bdt files)

Hey guys, I want to translate Dark Souls III but I couldn't open bdt files. Already tried Rick's Tools(for DS1) and Atvaark's Binder Tool(for DS2) but they both stopped working before exporting. I need to find the text files, so if anyone can manage to open the bdt files, or even view what's inside them please contact me.

Refer to [this thread](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=14223) about the on-goings of unpacking DSIII files.
