- Post Title: Atari 50 Assets .PIE file

Hey everyone, I recently got the new Atari 50 anniversary collection, mainly for the sake of ripping some rare assets from the game like high quality artwork and possibly 3D models. The issue is that the entire 11GB asset library is compressed within a .PIE file, something I am not familiar with and is proprietary to Digital Eclipse, so at the moment, viewing any of the assets is impossible for me.

Has anyone had luck cracking one of these PIEs before? The same format was also used within the TMNT Cowabunga Collection.
