Nobody can help? Any Tips are useful.

The Problem seems, that there is one Font over another one and i can't separate it.

I don't know of any tools that could view this properly so you might have to make one yourself (or get someone else to). I would say that you are correct in the fact that there is one font on top of the other. Separating them shouldn't be too hard since it looks like none of the information is destroyed by having one on top of the other.
