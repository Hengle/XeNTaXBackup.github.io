- Post Title: What are those textures?

Those are some textures that I extracted from Gameloft's game. Seem like they are configured in other colorspace like HSL or HSV, not default RGB because they just have only red, green, yellow, purple color. And I don't know what program can open them or decrypt them completely. Hope you guys can help me.

HSL / HSV definition: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HSL_and_HSV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HSL_and_HSV)

Can, you be more specific? What game + reference (screenshot of gun, etc) to see original colors would be much helpfull.
