Figured asking won't harm >< I found this game online a while ago and since i love music games i find it pretty fun... 
However it's close to impossible to grab the models with Ninja Ripper properly and textures is a even bigger pain so i wanted to ask if someone could take a look at the game files.

I can also PM sample files if needed ><

Thanks in advance~

Any chance this game is running on UE4 engine? Models look like they're from an Asian mmo.

I'm sure it isn't UE4 because the files look nothing like it >< 
The game is asian so i guess that's why they look asian-mmo-ish
