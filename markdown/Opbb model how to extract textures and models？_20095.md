- Post Title: Opbb model how to extract textures and modelsï¼Ÿ

As far as I know, this game is almost the same as the Danganronpa V3 file.
npk is actually .srd
npki is actually .srdi
npkv is actually .srdv
.srdi - Model Data
.srd - File Infomation
.srdv - Image Data
Does anyone know how to extract textures and models? This is a sample file.
