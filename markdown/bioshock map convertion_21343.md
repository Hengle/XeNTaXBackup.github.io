- Post Title: bioshock map convertion

I would be interested in retrieving the bioshock maps one and two. I didn't find much but I found a tool to convert the maps of Quake 3, I tried to see if it could work but unfortunately it didn't happen. I would like to know if maybe there is someone who could help me modify this tool
