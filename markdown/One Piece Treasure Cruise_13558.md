Hi guy,

I want to rip sprites from Android Games "One Piece Treasure Cruise" .

VR Resource doesn't have the sprites yet. Thought that if I able to rip something, I can contribute them to VR Resource too.

I tried change the extension from APK to ZIP. I only saw these PNGs inside the "assets" folder.

Can anyone teach or point me the tutorials (if any)? Thanks All.

The data is installed on the device when using the game. I play the game so I've seen before that the sprites and images are stored on the device as .png's. You should install the game on an android device, or use an emulator, and check storage to find the sprites you want.

As I said, the APK won't have the sprites you are looking for, they are installed onto the device when playing the game. You will need root permissions to find it if you use an android device however.
I believe they are located in:
data/data/com.namcobandaigames.spmoja010E/files/Cache/container
