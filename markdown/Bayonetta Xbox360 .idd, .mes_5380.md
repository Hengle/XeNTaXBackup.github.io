- Post Title: Bayonetta Xbox360 .idd, .mes

Hi guys! I want to translate  Bayonetta (menu+dialogs+interface). Searching this forum i found archive with usefull tools and unpacked game archives. In \media\data00\id\ there is us,fr,gr,it,jp,sp folders with .idd files like chapter000.idd or tutorial101.idd (97 files). In other directory (\media\data00\mess\) there is 221 file in .mes format. Files from other archives(data01, data02 etc) is in .dat format, containing textures and models. 
For example, i'll post one file from english translation in .mes and another one in .idd. How can i decode it to text file\extract data from it ? And another question.. I extracted game data, OK, but if i'll modify game files, i need to recreate .idd and .cpk archive to actually play the translated version. How can i do it ?
