- Post Title: Dirty Bomb Game Model Help

So Dirty Bomb is in open Beta now, It runs Unreal Engine, and has a really nice aesthetic and models.

Umodel works to extract textures, but meshes display this error:



Is there an alternate method to extracting meshes from Unreal games? (Rippers won't work, game uses launcher)

Played the beta, didn't like the chaotic atmosphere...

anyways, nice looking models, yes, but nothing out of the ordinary

You have a sample ?

I can provide a sample of a game's .umap format, which umodel can get textures from, but won't export the mesh

It's a free-to-play game, so Is it alright if I post one of the game's files?
