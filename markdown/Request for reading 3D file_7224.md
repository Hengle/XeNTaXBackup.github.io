Yes, that would be nice, considering how I have no idea what game or program that is.
I imagine not a lot of other people would either.

Have you tried searching ragezone or elitepvpers?

I did a quick google and found some discussion on the eva format, but not sure if they had worked out something. Or whether they actually released information (cause for some reason 95% of the devs there keep their stuff "private private" so "noobs can't get it", which doesn't make sense to me cause even if noobs got it they probably wouldn't have a clue what to do with it besides complain.)

I also noted that there's discussion about some sort of archive.
Did you have to unpack it? If so, what did you use.

Okey first i come from ragezone and there isn't any info about the .eva that works i know only 1 man ho read them but he dont tell how he do it. And i try Cinema4D 3ds max and some other software's but with no luck.

Here is the video where he view them: [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQjPyBh7 ... ideo_title](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQjPyBh70SA&feature=channel_video_title)

So many people asked him for the software but he don't tell it he just answers its difficult to edit them and he said that he write his own plugin to read them but i find hard that to belive.

In elitepvp isnt any info too i search for this from a long time ago i found out that .eva is some kind of a Japanese software but when i DL it it doesn't work so i em at the start again.

I really dunno if must be unpacked but i think it must not.


PS: and if there a way to convert the to some format that Cinema 4D or 3ds max can read it dunno whre to search anymore :X
