- Post Title: URF NDS files

Hello there,

I'd like to rip music from the NDS game MySims Racing, but VGMToolbox does not manage to extract files "No extractable data found"

The game uses unusual format .urf to store audio files, do any of you knows how to get something from it? [http://www.mediafire.com/download/i3c24 ... _Audio.urf](http://www.mediafire.com/download/i3c24sae09p8uzw/Rom_Audio.urf)

Thanks
