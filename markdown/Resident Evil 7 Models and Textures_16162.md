- Post Title: Resident Evil 7 Models and Textures

Hello everyone!
I am completely new in this.
I want to extract the meshes and textures of the objects that appear in the image:

( the table, the table lamp, the flowers, etc)

This are my questions:
- What tutorials should I follow?
- What tools do I need to use?
I hope someone is so kind to guide me with this.
Thanks in advance.
