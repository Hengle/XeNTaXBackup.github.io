Old, but still usable and featuring the latest Mediawiki code.

Good to finally have it back (and for a bit of shameless strutting (  ), you can all thank me that the restored version is as new as it is (which is to say, mid-2008); otherwise, the restored version would have been one from 2007).

So, any contingency plans to make sure this (as in, having to fall back on such an old backup) can't happen in the future, Mr.Mouse?

Yeah, we've discussed options with our host. There will be other backup moments at regular intervals.

Great to see you didn't let the attack get you down, though it's of course a shame for the edits that got lost.

Keep the good work up!

Best wishes,
Deniz

Hell yeah! glad to see the wiki & all is back   
A part of us all which was lost, now is found   

And may those responsible for this cowardly attack endure excruciating deaths...

I can't decide if you're really agreeing with techie, or just being sarcastic here.  

I remember looking years ago for ways to unify logins between MediaWiki and phpBB, but as I recall, the only stuff I found required some DB work first, and an extension for phpBB. Maybe the situation has improved since then, though.

Hi!

Was the MediaWiki code broken when the XenTax attacked?   and does it update time to time? and can you tell me the link between MediaWiki and phpBB so that i can understand about "Need one login for all stuff here"  

Thanks
