- Post Title: Kingdom Hearts Re:CoM (PS4) Model/Animation Tool

Tool for the PS4 remaster of Chains of Memories which is included in Kingdom Hearts HD 1.5 + 2.5 ReMIX. Mostly tested with player/enemy/npc models and animations. It should technically load other skinned stuff too. It won't work with maps or anything from the PS2/PS3 versions of the game.

Few examples of models loaded





How to use

Load

MDL: Loads a single skinned model. Meshes with no material are discarded.
Note: RTM  file needs to be in the same folder for the textures to load.
ANN: Loads all the animations inside the ANN file. Navigate using the arrow keys.
Export

NUX: Exports the model to a custom binary format (.nux), intended to be loaded by Noesis. Noesis script for this format : NUX Script
Textures: Exports the textures in PNG format.
Note : Models and textures will be exported into the folder Export.

any chances you could make this load on the PS2 version as well?
