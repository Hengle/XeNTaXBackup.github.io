- Post Title: GFAC Strikes Again - Certain files in Kirby's Epic Yarn

So, I'm messing around with Kirby's Epic Yarn and, for the most part, HCS' (You're awesome btw) GFAC script, found [here](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?p=35866), does not want to work with a few files. One of them being "E3.gfa." Seeing as I liken myself as a VG researcher, getting that E3.arc out of there is now a high priority because... Well... I now know it's there. Just wondering if any of you guys can figure out why it refuses to output any files for me. I tried messing with the script to no avail, and even referred it to a few friends. No dice. You're the experts. Help if you wanna', I guess. Here's the file: [http://www.mediafire.com/file/j064x1u67fmg993/E3.gfa](http://www.mediafire.com/file/j064x1u67fmg993/E3.gfa)
