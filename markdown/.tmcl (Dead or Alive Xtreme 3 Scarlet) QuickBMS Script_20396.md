Good Evening, My Friends. I have finally got something finished, a script for DOAX3 Scarlet For Nintendo Switch. Remember the post that doax3 fortune had a tmcl which was basically the container for the ps4 gnf format, this version has g1t's which can be extracted with my WORKING QuickBMS script, it has no name which the past games of doax3 and doa5lr pc/ps4 came with in their tmcl files. i hope everything works well with my script.

Warning: this script is exclusive to xentax, use on other websites without permission from me is prohibited, thank you.

P.S, also use a program to open the g1t's
