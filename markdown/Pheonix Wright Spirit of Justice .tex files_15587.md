- Post Title: Pheonix Wright: Spirit of Justice .tex files

There are a few tex converters but none seem to work on Spirit of Justice.

tex2png: [https://github.com/invertego/tex2png](https://github.com/invertego/tex2png) - Only works with iOS Dual Destiny

Turnabout Tool: [https://github.com/FrozenFish24/TurnaboutTools](https://github.com/FrozenFish24/TurnaboutTools) - Only seems to work on Dual Destiny 3ds and Dai Gyakuten Saiban: Naruhodō Ryūnosuke no Bōken

I've uploaded some sample .tex files.
