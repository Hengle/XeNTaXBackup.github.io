What is it you ask for ?  The source code for the Wave Injector by Class? or do you wish to know how to code a Wave Injector yourself? Or do you wish to know the command line options for the wave injector program? If that last is the case, please attach / email the Wave Injector somewhere here so we can take a look at it.

Why not use the tool Filestripper (you can found this in the wiki) it includes a massive injector data too

"CLASS/BACKLASH" is a known such called "release group" and their code shouldn't be discussed here, I think. If somebody downloads something from the net somewhere, he should know how to use it.

Yeah, I know it's a warez group. Still, the question could be legitimate: how to code a sound injector, this could in theory also be for honest purposes. But as the guy does not respond to these questions I asked, we may as well close the thread.

i would be interested to learn how to code wave injector, it is for honest and eductional purposes only, so if anyone could guide and help me, would appreciate it a lot.

i also tried to find any information about or source code with no luck, still digin the forums maybe someone will know.

another thing i was trying to figure how do they get the sound files unpacked that shows sound file offset "sound_0F078000_00227054" in the archive, i have tried inject some files with class injector but it always says that you need start/lenght indicator which is an example of the above file name, i got this from one demo they did some years ago. was trying to understand how do they do it.
