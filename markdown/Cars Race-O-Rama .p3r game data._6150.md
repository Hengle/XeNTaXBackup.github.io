you must cut the file first :)
try with this cutter:
[blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/filecutter1_0_1.zip](http://forum.xentax.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/filecutter1_0_1.zip)

or this one:
[http://www.xentax.com/downloads/tools/filecutter.zip](http://www.xentax.com/downloads/tools/filecutter.zip)

those are suggested in the rules you see in orange at the top of the forum
