- Post Title: Searching for a specific decompiler...

Hello fine folks. I was hoping someone here could help me out. Recently I have had a computer crash, which caused me to lose all my files. Unfortunately I was working on a game in Multimedia Fusion 2, and had compiled it into an executable file prior to the crash and sent said executable to my friend for testing purposes. I lost my original source files to the crash and now I have no way of continuing my work. Is there a program out there that can convert the EXE into the modifiable files again so I may finally finish up my project? The full effect of this tragedy is the fact I have lost all my graphics and if I were able to extract the files from the EXE it would be so much easier to complete my game properly. For an example of a Fusion game, you can download them from many places, games like Noitu Love or I'm OK, or even I Wanna Be The Guy. I'm a bit paranoid of actually releasign my own game to people without it being complete...

Anyway, IS there a Fusion Decompiler that I can use to recover my resources?

if you mean obtaining the original source code (c, c++, delphi and so on) from your executable the answer is no, it's not possible.
exist pseudo decompilers but they are nothing else that the tentative of translating the assembly instructions of the exe in a pseudo C code

And I have not heard of a Fusion specific decompiler as well. Sorry.

But you might be able to extract the graphics if they are embedded into the exe with some resource hacker or by hand.

Well in that case all I need to do is extract the graphics. I can remake the game, which I had intended on doing in the first place since it's been a long time since I had the original file to work with. Are there any graphics extractors for such a purpose? I'd like to have these back and it would take ages to recreate them all over again.

Doesn't seem to. Either that or I have no idea how to use it properly.
