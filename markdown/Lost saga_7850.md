Hi! I found this game with an archive that starts with famous PK. But extracting gives me 0kb files but structure is ok. zip.bms gives me error:

"unknown zip sig 24936 at offset 61"

1mb code from archive:

because the format is a modified zip archive.
anyway it doesn't contain deflate (compressed) data, so it uses encryption/obfuscation or something else.

Here is some exe and dll files, maybe the key to the mystery is inside?
