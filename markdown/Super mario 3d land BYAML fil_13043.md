- Post Title: Super mario 3d land BYAML fil

Hello everybody do anyone know how we can edit BYAML (binary yaml files) If I open a BYAML file in a hex editor I get the following values and read able data too. Now my question is how can I edit the placements of the objects as we see there is an object called PorterRoomA, but how do I find its coordinates or something ? 



I have also a link for the file.

[http://s000.tinyupload.com/index.php?fi ... 9828667297](http://s000.tinyupload.com/index.php?file_id=73616494069828667297)

Please help me!
