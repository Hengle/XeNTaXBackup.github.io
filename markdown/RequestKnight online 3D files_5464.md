I note your uploaded files contain .n3cskins files.

I added the Knight Online *.n3cskins (and the Knight Online	*.dxt) loader modules to the 3D Object Converter I released the v4.4432 now.

You can update your installed application (version>=4.0) quickly and easily using the auto-update function (Help/Check for updatesâ€¦).
