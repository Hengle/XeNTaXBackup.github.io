- Post Title: Are there any Ellie and Abby models out there?

It's been two weeks since I got into The Last of Us, me and one of my friends are thinking about a little project (sadly it's not porn, unless you would help for that), but we need two models from the second game, Ellie and Abby. We looked for them on internet but without any result, we tried Tor too. So, can someone help us with that or literally nobody ripped those yet because the game was published a month ago?
