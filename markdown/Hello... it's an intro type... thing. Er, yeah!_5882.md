- Post Title: Hello... it's an intro type... thing. Er, yeah!

So uh...yeah! I'm so happy I found this forum. I knew of a few others that were related to game research but none to this extent. I'm next to useless when it comes to programming or reverse engineering.. but I do love to tinker with stuff in 3dmax. I also love using the wonderful tools other people have provided and playing around with what files end up dumped or with model viewers. (yay for finding a ton of the dialogue in KH/KH2... Now I can make them repeat their lines with no bgm if I wanted! )

So anyway.. great forum and I'm happy to have found it!

Thank you very much!    I wish I could contribute and help out, but sadly it's not my area of expertise. I think I would find such things as reverse engineering unknown file formats quite interesting, though.
