- Post Title: Splintercell Blacklist Paladin 3D extraction

Really need to extract the entire paladin, aircraft interior before and after paladin upgrades.

(Ninjaripper)

3 copies of every object, same space
everything is dumped at zero coordinates
The textures are messed up

(3DRipperDX) has some issues, major one being skewed / rotated models no matter what fov I use.


The ninjarip uv's can be fixed copying from 3dripperdx obj.
some objects can be placed accurately if they share a same vertex coordinate.
manually separating all the ninja rip objects, and working out their world positions is mind numbing frustration.

Is there anything else possible to help, decrease the work

I believe that Blacklist is supported by Gildor's UModel.

I can't say if it's going to be easy because it is UMD packed.

But you can try..
