- Post Title: Aggressive Inline Level Files

Hey! Been puzzling over this particular format for a while. I don't really know anything about this, which is why I've come here to ask for help...

I'd like to extract the levels from Aggressive Inline to an .OBJ or similar, to make them playable in THUG PRO, a mod of Tony Hawk's Underground 2.

The most I can glean is that the levels were made in an old version of 3DS Max and then converted to some presumably in-house file formats. The files themselves (.GEO, .INS, .TXR) appear to be IFF data. The same file formats were used for Dave Mirra Freestyle BMX 2 and BMX XXX.

I can't attach a file because the levels are bigger than 5 MB, so I zipped up all the levels instead and put them on Mega (these are from the NTSC PS2 version):

All the levels have an export .TXT which actually lists all the file names if that makes anything easier...

Any help would be greatly appreciated! Thanks so much!

I've had a bit of luck with some .bms scripts. One that extracts stuff from IFF archives and one that's able to get models out of the .geo file (AggressiveInlineZITto3ds.bms). While it's definitely possible to manually piece together all the parts of the level this way, it's a real pain in the ass putting everything in the right place, setting up UV maps and all the rest of it. Can anyone help me to find where all this stuff is stored so that I can do all of this automatically? Cheers

Hey again - sorry to double post but I've found a tool that will extract games on this engine to an .obj.

However it misses a lot of stuff on import for Aggressive Inline, and only works on the Gamecube/Xbox level files.

Would like some help to see if anyone knows how to fix it... Thanks 

Here's a link to the Gamecube level files: [https://mega.nz/#!wV83FarK!PRW947Plyg6o ... UNWPS8ooUo](https://mega.nz/#!wV83FarK!PRW947Plyg6oNNKmd1gXuqfW2Z61TM_T5UNWPS8ooUo)
