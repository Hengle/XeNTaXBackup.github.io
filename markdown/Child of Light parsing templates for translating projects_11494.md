- Post Title: Child of Light parsing templates for translating projects

Hy guys,
010 Editor is a powerfull, scriptable hexeditor and I made some binary templates for localization and font map files.

The pack included these files:
- ChoL-DLC2-localisation-common-template.bt
- ChoL-DLC2-localisation-language-template.bt
// Aurora Pack, sry I don't even bought Golem DLC

-ChoL-localisation-common-template.bt
-ChoL-localisation-language-template.bt
// Base localization files. ChoL-localisation-language-template.bt work any language.

-ChoL-tfn-files-template.bt
// Font texture's charachter map

-ChoL-tga.ckd.template.bt
// A simple parser for cutting header and save DDS, for .tga files

Some screens:








I hope is will be usefull for your any translation project.


Some tipp:
[Here is a pack](http://www.speedyshare.com/t3CRD/localization.7z) for all game files what need for localization(.tga,.tfn,.isg).

Don't need extracting game, if you patch .ipk files with wrong pathnames***, the game use these files, just extract in your game root folder.

Don't forget read the comments in temaplate files! 

***Like:

Here you go ZORROSYR, these are the 3 cached screenshots from Google Image Search. Tiny and blurry, but better than nothing, I hope.

No problem. If you want, you can   officially  thank me by clicking the  button at the bottom corner of that post. (Or anyone else's post, for that matter.)

edit: Whoops, I guess you already know, sorry about that.

I don't have Child of Light, but I think I understand what tomsolo is saying, maybe. (I could be wrong, though.)

BYPASSING IPK FILES: Maybe you know this first part already. Do you understand what tomsolo is saying about .ipk files, starting at "Here is a pack for..."? I think he's saying the font textures are usually packed inside .ipk archives, but if you follow his instructions, the game will read the unpacked font texture files instead. (If you want I can try to explain this part more, otherwise okay.)

EDITING UNPACKED TEXTURES: Check out [this thread, especially tomsolo's post](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?p=94399#p94399). He mentions photoshop:

> The fonts it's a simple mapped DXT3 textures - see *tga* tag in filenames, just replace with photoshop to a non used char with your language specific character.

I hope my information is correct, because I can't try it for myself...
