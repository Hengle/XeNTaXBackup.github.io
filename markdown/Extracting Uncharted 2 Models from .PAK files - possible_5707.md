Yea, I looked at every file through a hex editor.  It seems that:

Chloe.pak - contains all the textures (body, hair, eyes, clothes, etc).  
Chloe-base.pak - contains mesh files for base model.
Chloe-winter.pak - contains mesh files for winter model.

The same applies to Nathan Drake and the rest of the U2 cast.

Here are all the characters just in case you're interested in this project but want to extract a favorite character:

Keep in mind, some of these are bigger than a normal 3D figure because I included EVERY character-related asset in each respective link.  I didn't want to miss anything.  They take 10 minutes at most to fully download, if not shorter.

Would either of these work? 

[http://sourceforge.net/projects/dragonunpacker/](http://sourceforge.net/projects/dragonunpacker/)

[http://www.aegidian.org/gqt/depak/index.html](http://www.aegidian.org/gqt/depak/index.html)

Did a google search and found them. Haven't tried them yet though.

I would also be interested in these models. I doubt the two programs you listed will work on Uncharted .pak files, considering they are most likely unique in format to this particular game, but it's worth a shot I suppose. I will do some research on .pak extractors, maybe we will get lucky.

Alright, Dragon Unpacker doesn't recognize the file type, and I wouldn't touch the other one, it's a .sit file, which is not a valid windows installer package (hence, it is probably a virus). Also, Game Extractor doesn't work either. Does someone have the full version of Game Extractor? The full version has a function which allows you to scan an unknown compressed file format for files inside. That might work. I also sent Watto, the guy who wrote Game Extractor, an email asking him to provide support for Uncharted .PAK files in his program. If anyone with some serious programming and/or hex editor knowledge could join us in this noble quest, I'm sure we could have a functional model and texture extractor within a few weeks.

Don't see any obvious things.
I can see a bunch of file paths about a quarter way into the file, but don't know what they might be for.



Don't see any recognizable data.

Header doesn't make sense to me either.
