- Post Title: The Witcher 3 Noesis Plugin?

A few years back, there was a Noesis plugin floating around called fmt_TW3_to_XPS.py, which could convert models from The Witcher 3, but all the links to it are now dead. Does anyone here happen to have a copy?

No, that's why I'm asking.

There are other ways to extract the models, such as:

I just wish there was a way to convert the redcloth files.
