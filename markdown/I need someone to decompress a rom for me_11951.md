There is no tool to unpack 3DS roms currently.

There are a few people on Xentax going through 3DS data, but its not from ROMS, its from RAM dumps and so its already decompressed.

3ds roms can be extracted with a 3ds.
but smash brothers is using the new 7x crypto. so that can not be extracted yet.

Oh, go on, or does this still require a firmware below 4.5?

Oh, I see. So if I had a 4.3 3DS with Gateway, I could use it to extract older ROMs, but not newer ones like Smash Bros.

Hypothetical here.. but how does EmuNand w/ Gateway bypass this? Could someone create homebrew that runs through Gateway on Emunand 7.x or higher to decrypt Rom's from the microSD?

gateway blocks these things.
But I have a feeling there will be pc tools to decrypt roms or something to replace gateway and let us decrypt any rom.
