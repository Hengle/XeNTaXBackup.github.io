- Post Title: Red Dead Redemption XTD Texture Format Research

I extracted files in RPF of RDR and here's some samples:

But someone needs to make a tool to view and extract the textures.

I think once you explain step by step how to decompress the files more people like me will help you.

I'm not sure what your point is? All I said was that I posted some decompressed texture files (cant find my post again now) , whereas your files are compressed.
