- Post Title: Gm2 help

Good afternoon, this is my 2nd topic in this problem, I'm trying to work with the Gm2 format that is used in the game 5street

I tried to use a script [ fmt_AgeOfWulin_gm2.py  ](https://github.com/RoadTrain/noesis-plugins-official/blob/master/finale00/fmt_AgeOfWulin_gm2.py) but it doesn't help, different errors that I'll show in the photo, I'll also attach the files I'm trying to work with

[ Error 1  ](https://ibb.co/RCdJzNM)
[ Error 2  ](https://ibb.co/2KhVYJX)
[ Error 3  ](https://ibb.co/yPWcKXH)

This work is very important to me, so I will be grateful to anyone who can help me import and export this format

[ Files .Gm2  ](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qLUOz6XWFfesKhSVVWhJSIfqhaNEVN1T/view?usp=sharing)

Thanks.
