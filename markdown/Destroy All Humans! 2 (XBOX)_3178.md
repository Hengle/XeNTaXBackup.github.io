- Post Title: Destroy All Humans! 2 (XBOX)

Hello, currently I've been scouring the web for anything that might help me unpack these files. Basically what I'm looking for are the audio files, and the image files (Such as the in-game concept art) I figure it'd probably be best to take this in steps, so first off let me state that all files are stored in either PKG files or DIR files. The file I am uploading is a cut of one of the files in the audio folder. I expect this one to contain a few common music files which are played in game. After this one is analyzed I hope we can figure out a possible music and sound extractor, then we can move on to image files. If there are any requested files I can either make cuts of them or upload them to my filefactory account. What I'm trying to get out of this is the music and the concept art. I hope we can help each other out!
