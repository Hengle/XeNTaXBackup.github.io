- Post Title: [REQUEST] Tool to edit .spt and ,b Medarot files (3DS)

Hey Guys,

I need help with some files of medarot Nintendo 3DS.

I have checked the .spt files of the game and they can be translated on hex editors because the text is uncompressed shift-jis. The files seem... simple...  but hex translating is really annoying because we mess the files all the time.
We really need a tool which is able to edit this files and translate the text.

I've uploaded a few of this .spt and .b files.

Hopefully someone could help us by creating a tool.

Thanks!
