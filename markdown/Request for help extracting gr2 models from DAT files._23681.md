- Post Title: Request for help extracting gr2 models from DAT files.

Hi, I'm Cassidy. writes here because I hope someone can extract the gr2 models, sound effects and more from the DAT file. As you can see in the screenshot, I opened one file to show that not only models, sounds are there, but also folders where you can open these files. I want to repair all the files that are there: fonts, textures, models
"gr2", sound effects etc. Why do I care so much about unpacking all these files? I want to create animations from these models, if you can fix them, please send the repaired files to my e-mail: [karolinazelezinsska699@gmail.com](mailto:karolinazelezinsska699@gmail.com). I also want you to send a notebook with links to open the file, such as the ogg you recommend. If the files are repaired, I would be grateful.
