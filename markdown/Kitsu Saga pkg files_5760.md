- Post Title: Kitsu Saga pkg files

Hi,

I would like to get my hands on the models and animations of Kitsu Saga (free online MMORPG). Those files are stored within 80 .pkg files, named pkg001.pkg to pkg080.pkg, all about 10 MB in size. Further there are the files pkg.idx (about 8 MB), pkg.pkg (1 kB) and pkg.sp (1 kB). I had no luck trying to unpack those files via 7-zip.

Here is the link to the pkg001.pkg file: [http://www.speedyshare.com/files/26222122/pkg001.pkg](http://www.speedyshare.com/files/26222122/pkg001.pkg)

Thanks!

Thank you very much, your program works like a charm.

Took me a little while to realize that I need to target the pkg.idx instead of the pkg files themselves, but then everything unpacked with no problems.

Sorry it took so long to answer. I already gave up on this request and noticed your reply only by chance.  Thanks again.

Is this a new game? I don't remember seeing it before.
Is the client freely available for DL or do I need to sign-up for some testing period?

As I know it is free online game by Aeriagames. Year or two old. Eden Eternal and GrandFantasia by same studio used same Gamebryo engine and same packer.
saibotlieh can use these games for fantasy or anime style Civ4 mods, I think

Yes, the client is freely available and there is no registration necessary for the installation.

And yes, I'm always on the search for Gamebryo engine games since their models are relatively easy to convertion to Civ 4, using only Blender and NifSkope. Other game engine models need more work and I'm not able to convert their animations as well.

And besides, taking a peek into the graphic files of games is a lot of fun.
