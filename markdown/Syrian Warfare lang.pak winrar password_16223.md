did you tried .dll files?
maybe zip and winrar want a unfake password?
all game files have a password but all tool creator set a default password in tool files and when we want extract our files from package files... packages don't want a password. are you know that or not?
give me a small size from your package,
 maybe I can make a tool for you
just give me a small size of packages...
