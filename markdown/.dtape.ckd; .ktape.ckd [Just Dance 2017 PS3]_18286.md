- Post Title: .dtape.ckd; .ktape.ckd [Just Dance 2017 PS3]

Hi,
I want to convert pc data to be compatible with ps3 data.
Dtape contains file names and paths for pictos and moves. Pc files are readable, but in ps3 files I don't know what text between readable parts is.
Ktape should contain lyrics and their timing and score. As previously said pc files are readable but in ps3 files there is nothing readable except words from lyrics.
I would be grateful if someone could tell me how to decrypt ps3 files, so I could modify it and convert it to original format.
Here are files: [https://goo.gl/ZoAqr6](https://goo.gl/ZoAqr6)
