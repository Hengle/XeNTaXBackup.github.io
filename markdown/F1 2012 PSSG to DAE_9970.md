- Post Title: F1 2012 PSSG to DAE

Hey guys,

I come here because I need some help writing one of my programs. Currently I'm trying to export models from pssg files of the F1 2012 game by Codemasters.  If there is someone that knows the xml that goes into making a dae file, you can really help me speed things up.

Right now my program can open the file, and see its hierarchy/data, as well as export its textures if it has any. Right now I'm trying to figure out the proper DAE xml format for me to write all the model data from these pssg files.

I'm currently reading the specification, and looking at sample files to help me figure out how to store the information, but to be honest, I still don't really have an idea of where exactly to start.

Here's an example file of a car model pssg from Dirt: Showdown. No differences, except that its saved by Codemasters in xml format:

While I'm studying the Collada 1.4.1 specification, if someone that knows the dae xml well can give me a head start or example of how this file's dae xml format should look, it'd be great. If not, any other help is appreciated.
