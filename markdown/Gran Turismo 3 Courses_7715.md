Hello,

I've searched the web and not found any hint on how to open those files, they doesn't have any extension, but I know that in the first "stage" they are GZip compressed files, inside there is a file with the same name and without extension.

Someone can help me figuring how to open this file? 

(for example, Special Stage Route 11)

[Compressed](http://www.mediafire.com/?bpqnpd1vdza775m) ~3MB

[Uncompressed](http://www.mediafire.com/?yduimu5moii8ynm) ~10MB

They came from my Gran Turismo 3 PAL copy from the EU folder, if other files are needed just ask; thanks in advance.

WOW! I hate to sound silly, but how did you do that? Even having that would be great. We can always retexture the tracks if UV data is lost.

Thanks a lot Denis, I don't want to sound too pretentious, but, how did you get the model to be viewed?
