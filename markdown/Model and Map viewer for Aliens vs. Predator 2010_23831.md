- Post Title: Model and Map viewer for Aliens vs. Predator 2010

I wrote some tools by myself, to analyze "Aliens vs. Predator 2010". Personally interested in aliens behavior, but its other topic.

Map viewer allows you see map itself. Look for unused objects. View collision geometry. View props. Analyze in-game scripting.
View entities, see their properties.



Model viewer is kinda fork from first tool, but more focused on models itself. I know there was topic about Noesis plugin with same functionality [[viewtopic.php?f=16&t=5534](https://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=5534)]
but i made it better, because tool allow see animation with vertex skinning. 



Also made tool that extract information from BLUE (Blueprint) chunk, contains some properties for game classes. like player health, NPC model names
Animation types, etc... bunch of interesting information. And a lot of small tools for my own purposes.

Note: before using them make sure you extracted mission and map archives ".pc". Read READMEs carefully.

Tools will be developed further if you have any suggestions about in what direction development should go, leave it here.
Iâ€™m not a professional programmer, so if you say "Your code is shit !!!  ", I agree with that.

This game uses "Asura Engine" so tools can maybe be applied to other games, with some slightly modifications.
I made these tools because of my curiosity to this game. I hope not only me that curious, and this information will help someone investigate further.

I Have some questions.
1.If I want to make some articles about asura engine files in Xentax Wiki, how to do that? Because registration for new users is disabled.
2.if I want to extract some models to some other file format, like most used in modeling etc... What file format is it ? What is most used? I need that format that can contain x, y, z coords + u, v for textures. Which format to use for maps ? because maps is huge and contain allot of meshed with different material. I think there need some special format.

I can help you with that. I am admin on the wiki and I can create an account for you if you'll contact me ragarding this case.
New articles are always appreciated. 
Just remember to keep naming convention in the article titles, use any of the newest articles as a template and use proper categories.


Btw, good job with the tools.
