- Post Title: War Wind Palette format.

Im working on combining all my game asset reverse engineering tools and information into a central application.
One thing which always bothered me, is that i am unable to correctly parse the Palette format of the War Wind games.
You can see the problem / preview of the palette here: [https://github.com/IceReaper/retroGDX/issues/1](https://github.com/IceReaper/retroGDX/issues/1)
Sidenote: Dominion Storm over Gift 3 seems to use a similar palette format. If i manage to read that, it might apply to that game too.
So if anyone is interested and able to help out, i would be very thankful!
