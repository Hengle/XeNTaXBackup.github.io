- Post Title: KOC2 English Translation Project

I am currently in the middle of trying to translate most menus in KOC2 to English, but my problem is that I do not know Japanese very well, and finding the pictures in the game menus and then cross-referencing the FAQ for the game is time consuming.  I was wondering if there were any Japanese translators here that could please help me.

First of all, here is the Facebook Album with the pictures from the game for the menus that I am updating -

And here is a little video of the Exhibition Menu translated, which I have done, along with the word "Head" in the Appearance Menu, which my friend did, to make sure he was doing the image changing correctly -

But if anyone from here could help by translating the words that are on the pictures, that would be really awesome.  Thanks for any help you can give.
