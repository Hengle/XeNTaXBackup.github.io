- Post Title: Extracting Block n Load Sound files

Trying to extract sounds from Block n Load.  I've gotten the .bnk files extracted to .wem files, but when I try to convert with ww2ogg, it tells me 

Pause error: Unknown chunk type

Where should I go from here? I've tried it with --inline-codebooks and --packed_codebooks_aoTuV_603, but always I get errors.

Also first post, yay!
