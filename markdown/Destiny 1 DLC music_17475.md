- Post Title: Destiny 1 DLC music

Hey guys and gals..

not sure if this is in the right place. But would anyone know how to get the files from the PS4 version, of the Destiny DLC (Dark Below/House of Wolves/Taken King/Rise of Iron) etc.

I can only ever download the base game and not the DLC from torrents - But from what i understand, especially if Destiny 2 on the PC is concerned, all the new DLC updates are automatically downloaded in the main folders. Please forgive me if i am not explaining myself properly.

I currently have the game and the DLC for Destiny - Dark Below/Rise of Iron/House of Wolves/Taken King. However, all the files are on the PS4. I have no idea how to get to these data files and that is what i am asking, at the moment, if there is anyway possible to get them. And anyone able to help with grabbing the data files (no doubt pkg files) so i can attempt to then extract them.

So to re-iterate what help i am looking for is, if there is anyone here that has managed to get/knows how to get to any downloadable DLC content that goes direct to the PS4 (maybe a data-miner) that can help me/point me in the right direction in finding the pkg files (or whatever they are) from the actual PS4! So that i can then extract the music from them

if you have access to a PS4 with fw 4.05 or below you could perform the public kernel exploit made by specterdev. with that you could mount the game if you own the disk games and get the game files via ftp. this would be your first step...after that you could get the all audio files out of it.

Why not just download them from YouTube? I think all the music is already uploaded there.

There is literally 100 of music cues not on the OST's that were sold. the only 'complete' score that was extracted was the base game, not the DLCs
