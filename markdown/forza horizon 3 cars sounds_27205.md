- Post Title: forza horizon 3 cars sounds

Hi i m majed

forza horizon 3 is encrypted files and i tried to go

D:\Games\FH3\gq6$l\l=6$h\vgh6hu=~\]j(\u{y6h6y^@lbbq8{q4@qbb^l1y02.`l8s

then i followed Atari1337 trick
Atari1337: They all follow the same pattern: {'l', 'a'}, {'`', 'b'}, {'^', 'c'}, {'6', 'd'}, {'q', 'e'}, {'v', 'f'}, {'{', 'g' }, {'@', 'h'}, {'$', 'i'}, {'7', 'j'}, {'s', 'k'}, {'b', 'l'}, {'g', 'm'}, {'8', 'n'}, {'h', 'o'}, {'u', 'p'}, {'f', 'q'}, {'4', 'r'}, {'~', 's'}, {'1', 't'}, {'=', 'u'}, {''', 'v' }, {'m', 'w' }, {']', 'x'}, {'!', 'y' }, {',', 'z'}, {'y', '_'}, {'_', '-' }, { '[', '0' }, { '0', '1' }, { 'w', '2' }, { 'k', '3' }, { '(', '4' }, { '2', '5' }, { 'j', '6' }, { '}', '7' }, { ';', '8' }, { '+', '9' },

ended with media/audio/fmodopus/x64/dod_challenger.bank this is example

and this is the bank file of dodge challenger [https://www.mediafire.com/file/6b7no1t9 ... .bank/file](https://www.mediafire.com/file/6b7no1t9xpw4rpg/pg_dod_challengerhellcat_15.bank/file)

but when i put this one in fmod banks tools still extracting random files with same name called .wav
but i f i stop fmodbankstools from extracting at for example 46% its gonna load up another sound for example
even if go to folder in fmodbankstools called fsb and i used fsbextractor tools its gonna load alot of files but same names dodgechallenger1
dodgechallenger2
dodgechallenger3 and like this till 50 sounds
when i tried to run this dodgechallenger sound fsb at the end its corrupted its bomb sound or broken effect happend in sound .wav fsb

my problem is how to extract it with real cars names acceleration like 1000 2000 3000 and limiter and idle and off engine sounds i give to u my link up there have dodge challenger sound can anyone help me with any tool to extract this one at prefect way

thanks
