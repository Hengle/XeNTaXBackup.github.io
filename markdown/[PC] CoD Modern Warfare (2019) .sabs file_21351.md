- Post Title: [PC] CoD: Modern Warfare (2019) .sabs file

So Modern Warfare released some days ago and no one have made a post yet on opening the .sabs files that are commonly used in new CoD games.
DTZxPorter doesn't publicly work on the Wraith tools and Wraith doesn't want to unpack the files. Anybody got any ideas how to open them and what might have changed?

Link to a few sabs files: [https://mega.nz/#F!KN5CXYhA!_kzyTs_qx3FDY6ZmET1nLw](https://mega.nz/#F!KN5CXYhA!_kzyTs_qx3FDY6ZmET1nLw)

Any help would be appriciated.

EDIT: guess i clearly didn't research enough and found a tool that can unpack it [https://github.com/Scobalula/Greyhound/releases](https://github.com/Scobalula/Greyhound/releases)
