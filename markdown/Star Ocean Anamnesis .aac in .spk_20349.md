Someone in HCS forum tell me that these may be IMA-ADPCM files, even they have .aac extension.

But how can i play it ? 
I attach the final .aac here.

I previously posted to zenhax, 
address 0x148 set to 78, playback is possible with vgmstream (need rename extension to *.laac).
But it is very noisy...

You remind me of that URL, actually i ignore it before.
(i even didn't know 0x148 is an address, it should be on aac rather that the SPK)

I have not ever test the former decrytion .SPK, you should also try the new decrytion tool.
Just like what I expected, vgmstream play it very well.
I don't know your "very noisy" means. Even i compare the output file with the recording sound.
I just get a conclusion that the audio quality is not great, but enough.


maybe you should attach your "very noisy" output file.

I have recorded the voices of characters, etc. On the other hand, laac clearly has noise.
I do not feel particularly inconvenient because I have already recorded all the audio I need from the game.

*Edit
Oh, it seems that current encryption can not open spk. It was once possible.
When decompress spk, it becomes aac(need split)

*more Edit
I had an old file of 2017. Because I'm only interested in Valkyrie Profile characters.
Apparently vgmstream has been updated and the noise problem has been resolved.
