- Post Title: [Request] Animation importer

Hi! 
I'm need service from a person who can write script for importing animation from the game to 3ds max or Blender.  If anyone is interested and he has time, skills for such task, please contact me via PM (To discuss details, reward and to have a deal).
Thanks!

Hi!
Ok, so here are the details. I need animation importer for Ultimate Marvel vs Capcom 3 or for DMC 3 - your choise (I prefer UMvsC 3 but if it's impossible, then don't bother). If you think that you able to do it, state your price for import script   !

I've noticed that RE 5 and DMC 4 has similar model (.mod and .dom for xbox 360 ) and animation (.lmt) extension with Marvel vs Capcom 3. If it's possible to make animation script for RE 5 it will be awesome.

Hey, I'm interested in an animation importer too, for studying/reference purpose. The games you named are a good base.
I'm willing to contribute $, would be cool to make the script public afterwards too.

i really just have not gotten back around to testing the current findings regarding the LMT formats for RE5/DMC4.  Given the progress Surveyor made with the information that was reversed it should be pretty close to working.  Will try and see what i can do, but i can't make any real promises.

Hey! 
I fully agree to make importer public. I don't need it only for myself, anyone could put it to a better use  Create animation script it's a hard work though, I hope someone could handle this task.

yeah, I think it's very hard, if you search the forum there are very few posts related to animation.
Kentilan did a great job for animations with the BRRES viewer, you can get all the animations from RE Darkside/Umbrella Chronicles, but other than that, I've never seen animations from RE.

As revelation said he can't make any promises, but nonetheless is it common to use some sort of fundraisers for hard tasks like this, or the coder is compensated after he finishes it?
