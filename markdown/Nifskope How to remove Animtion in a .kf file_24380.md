- Post Title: Nifskope How to remove Animtion in a .kf file

Hello everyone, first of all I apologize for my bad english. I would like to know if there is a simpler version to split .kf files i.e. that I split the single animations in one big .kf file into other .kf files. Attached is a picture of the file and the file itself.
