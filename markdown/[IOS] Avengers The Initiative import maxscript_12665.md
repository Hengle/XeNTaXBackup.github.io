- Post Title: [IOS] Avengers: The Initiative import maxscript

Hi guys! Here's maxscript to import [iOS] Avengers: The Initiative with bones and weights (3ds max 2009-2014) 
Tool to extract files [https://www.sendspace.com/file/hkafci](https://www.sendspace.com/file/hkafci)
Use GUI for it, option to extract -"extract-raw". All models are in \Payload\AvengersAssemble.app\Data\Raw\AssetBundles\Characters folder (inside folder with character name will be folder "Model" they are .unity3d files)
Tool to extract textures [https://www.sendspace.com/file/sbh6ik](https://www.sendspace.com/file/sbh6ik)
Tool for textures - any .pvr tool

Instruction:

1) Extract bone_merge.7z from Avengers_The_Initiative_Tools.7z. Copy files into "Transform" folder of your extracted bundle. Run bones_combin.bat file, you will get skeleton_file.bin
2) Run Avengers_The_Initiative.ms in 3ds max 
3) Import skeleton_file.bin first
4) Import file from "SkinnedMeshRenderer" folder 
5) Script automatically will ask you to import corresponding mesh file - navigate to "Mesh" and import it! (Name displayed in the window)

Done!
