- Post Title: Medal Of Honor 2010 Font support

Hi everyone,

  I translated Batman: Arkham Asylum and Saw:the Video game to Turkish before and now I'm translating Medal Of Honor 2010 game.Medal Of Honor is my third ut3 engine based translation. I searched for game files and INT folder there are some game files that I can translate perfectly. But I have some problems with the fonts. In Batman Arkham Asylum there is a font named "Rockwell WGL" which is supporting all of the Turkish Characters. I can change the font type from \Batman Arkham Asylum\BmGame\Localization\INT\Gfxfonts.int file. 

This is the Batman Arkham Asylum Gfxfonts.int content. I change all the original font types to Rockwell WGL so it can show all Turkish characters.

[FontLib]
FontLib=Fonts_en.fonts_en

[Fonts]
Game=Rockwell WGL,Normal
OCR=Rockwell WGL,Normal
Title=Rockwell WGL,Normal

[IME]
MoviePath=GFxIME.IME

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

And this is the Medal Of Honor GFXUI.INT content.

[FontLib]
FontLib=Fonts_en.fonts_en

[Fonts]
DefaultFont=Myriad Pro SemiExt,Normal
DefaultFont_Bold=Myriad Pro Light SemiExt,Normal
Trademark=trademark,Normal

[IME]
MoviePath=GFxIME.IME

[Translation]
Enable=1

[Global]
No Trigger=No Trigger!

I just want to add Batman:Arkham Aylum's Rockwell WGL font type to Medal Of Honor font library. If I add it, I think it can show every Turkish characters. Can someone help me about this problem ?
