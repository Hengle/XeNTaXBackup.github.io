I own a game modding forum 

[http://therockerscabin.com/soulxplorer/index.php](http://therockerscabin.com/soulxplorer/index.php)?

You could say its a Ninja Hacker Refuge forum   
We have recently decided to start a project that appears to be rather similar to your Xentax program. And NH's best coding talent is on it. I jsut wanted to check in and see exactly what this thing is (appears to be more of a databse) so we can stear clear of confrontation, and clear of using features you are including. Ours is not a databse of any sort, but more of a ToolBox. Any way. Jsut trying to keep the peace, could someone please outline its MAIN features (theres too many on the fornt page   ) So we can know to avoid them to have two great apps put out    Thanks in advance

(PS, i am regarded as a "would-be coder and am still learning)

Thanks!   

What kind of ToolBox is your program going to be? 

When a first release is out it might be an idea to add the program to the Game Resource WIKI so visitors there can find it as well.

possibly, i wouldnt mind that    thanks. 

And seeing as i have a site full of NH'ers, it is going to be something similar to Ninja TB. Details on its functions cant be given away yet, but we have big plans    It is meant to be a multi game tool, like your tool (with not that many games though, im amazed by the compatability of this tool) I cant go into detail of how our tool utilizes different games, but it will be out soon enough as V1.0
