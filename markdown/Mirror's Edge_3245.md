- Post Title: Mirror's Edge

This has to be one of the best games I've played for a long time.

For those of you who don't know, you assume the role of Faith in a city where the government controls all forms of communication except person-to-person, which is where the Runners come in - Faith is one of them. The gameplay revolves around running around the city (which is actually much more fun then it sounds), and any combat is minimized (to the point that there's an achievement for completing the game without ever shooting an enemy).

So, is this a rail-shooter type of thing, or are you free to go wherever you wish to go? Graphics look good.

perhaps if they had more violence or enlarged faith's breasts they would sell more, yeah, you know what i'm talking about
or if you don't then look here:

I must buy Mirrors Edge again then!
Hehe, indeed. Most of gamers now are males, and are interested in growing big boobed girls with miniskirts that shrink

You're free to go wherever, but the level design is rather linear... You have one main path to take, but you can go any number of routes along that path, depending on the objects around you and your creativity. Obviously, though, you have more possibilities outside than in buildings, so thankfully, most of the game is set outside.

This is one thing I (and many reviewers, as I recall) liked about ME - it didn't go with the stereotypical representation of females in games, opting instead for realism. Yes, Faith's boobs could have been D-cups (or bigger), but those aren't exactly conducive to [parkour](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkour).

That would actually hurt i think, D Cub boobs squashed to a wall.
