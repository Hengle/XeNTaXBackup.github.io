- Post Title: Capcom Breath of Fire EMI files

Hi
I'm trying to find some way to decompile and recompile the .EMI files in Breath of Fire 3.

Looking at getting to the Character sprites and Fonts.

I have tried MexCom, but get a Run-time error '339':
Component 'msinet.ocx' or one of its dependencies not correctly registered: a file is missing or invalid.

I also tried it on a XP machine and get a Java version not supported message. And when using the script by Mr.Mouse, I get an error message.

Can anyone help me get into these .EMI files? 

Edit:
got it sorted out now, less complicated than i thought!
