- Post Title: CHUNITHM NEW PLUS!! - Propietary SRD container file

so these are propietary container files for the arcade game Chunithm new plus, these deals with both how the animations plays inside the game and also contains some textures, there's zero documentation on how to edit these files out there, so it'd be nice to know how to edit them, these files can be found inside "surfboard", and it includes both an *.h and *.srd file



the .h file is probably something that tells the game wich layer the specific animation needs to go on judging by it's contents



the actual container file is this, wich i assume contains the animation formats and some textures? it includes a lot of headers in hex, and i dont know what they mean



and ofc, here's a sample of this .srd and .h file, having help with this would be great!

not sure how related this is but the acroarts folder in data brings up criware? acroarts looks to be dealing with ui stuff which feels familiar with stuff i see in the .srd files, just adding a lil info from what ive seen
