Hi all. The question arose of how to properly extract music from this game. Music is stored in *.HOG files in the RESOURCE folder (probably with all other resources) and is encoded in Sony ADPCM Compressed format. But the problem is that I can't find the right Interleave in any way. Either it is variable, or I'm doing something wrong or I don't understand it.
