- Post Title: Texture Problem with Brres Viewer

I exported the meshes of Sheena from Tales of Symphonia Dawn of a New World and the texture looks fine in Maya. The problem is: When I open the UV Layout editor, I can't see the UV layout at all. I imported the mesh as an obj in Photoshop for editing and the texture is badly applied.

Photoshop:


I'm thinking there might be a problem with the UV that maybe I can fix in Maya before exporting. I'd like some tips on how to fix this please.

EDIT: I can see the UV Layout fine, I wasn't set on the right UV map, however I still can't figure out what causes that problem in photoshop.


EDIT: I found the answer myself. The UV map on which the texture was wasn't the default one. I copied the UV map to the default one and deleted all the others to make sure nothing stayed and it imported well in photoshop for editing.
