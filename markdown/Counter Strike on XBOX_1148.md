Problem is, I don't have a full sxwad file, only a first part of one. Which was enough to figure out the format. 

Obviously, MultiEx Commander already runs on your computer, right? And you can extract stuff from the sxwads you have? 

Tell you what, you send me a small sxwad file, and I'll replace some files in there, using MultiEx Commander. 

And yes, there's a way to get a serial.

ok... but i cant send you a small file... so i will give you a link to de_airstripe.SXWad and you can replace it with a cz map here...

in the de_airstripe.SXWad it will stand maps/de_airstripe.bsp somewere.. 
delete the file and import maps/de_rats (its a condition zero map working on xbox)

is this ok?..

I dont have credit card so i cant get the serial ... or can i get one free?

or use visual studio .net or something?

I have noticed that error as well. Just try to select it without actually clicking it. So use TAB and cursor keys to go to the file and then click the correct file in the left window, and then the > arrow to transfer that file to the replace window. Am I making sense? The preview option is limited to 1 Mb size. The decompressor however, will complain if it tries to decompress a file that is shortened. That's why the error occurs.

Yes. This is a bug. You can prevend it from happening by restarting MultiEx Commander, and doing all the things you did, but DON'T CLICK ON THE FILES FOR A PREVIEW! This is only really a problem with the BSP I think. ut try it, it works. I will remove the bug in a next version.

Hey guys, just to let you know, i've been having a bit of a go myself at modding cs. I found in the default.xbe sv_gravity and other such commands, so i have made a couple of patches changing the game's phsyics which work fine. Also, using multiex commander, i have exported the .awp mdl files, decompiled them, edited the skins, and recompiled. I just need to import them to see if they work in game. Could i get a free serial????   
I'm gonna sign up in just a sec.

Though funney, the only way to get a free serial is to sign up as a Friend. That'll still require your support.

Unfortuanately, i'm too young to have a credit card/paypal account. It says on the link though.. " Alternatively, show us that you support MultiEx Commander in any other way, and you will be offered a code as well!" 
Tell me how i can show my support!!

One way to do that is to write a script for an archive that Mr. Mouse and FriendsofWatto don't have time to do... There are probably a few other ways, for instance, I didn't write a script (but I did try!  ) and I was still graced with a free Serial Code. Oh, I remember what I did. I told Mr. Mouse that MexComcould support ZT *.ztd files because they are only zipped archives. That and promising to make a donation when I got the money, perhaps...

I was going to reply with a nice explanation of why it would be difficult to run other maps with the XBox executable because of the different file structure and graphics the XBox uses... plus it's memory constraints...and a lot more...

Then I noticed you were using files from an illegally downloaded version of Steam and it's games....

So... I'm not...

Turn off auto-preview, it attempts to show the.bsp file, but there's a limit on the size of a file that is previewed. For some reason, the file is kept open.
