(A handful of vertices seems to be superflous - didn't correct this.)

Use this h2o file to gain uvs, too:
(copy the lines into bianfu.h2o for example)
0x8746 1063
Vb1
12 99
0x5205 555
041000
0x29B5 8

well yes is a nice view, but anyway I don't wanna use this tool to export OBJ, maybe better get that with bones, maybe somebody can take a look into that and make a max scripts.
