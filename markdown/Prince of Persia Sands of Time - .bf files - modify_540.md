Is there a hope that the MultiEx Commander open/extract/modifyin' this file types? In the future realese?

The POPData.BF file contain all important text file, and if we can open/extract and modify than compress this one, we'll get a new, translated game for the hungarian gamers.

Pls, help to someone who wanna help others!
