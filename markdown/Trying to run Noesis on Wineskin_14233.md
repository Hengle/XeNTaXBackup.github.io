Recently I downloaded Wineskin on my Mac laptop so that I'd be able to run Windows apps so as to ween off VMWare. I've discovered that Noesis can only run if it's installed in the main :C\ (specifically I had it installed in the folder "Programs Folder (x86) within the virtually-made HD" but unfortunately I have no way of accessing the direct drive from my Mac. Has anyone been able to find a way around this problem? It'd be great if anyone can help me on this so thanks in advance.
