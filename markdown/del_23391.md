I have checked both samples, but I don't know how to solve your issue, sorry.

My advice is to look for NSIS source code and changelog 
[https://github.com/kichik/nsis](https://github.com/kichik/nsis)
[https://sourceforge.net/projects/nsis/](https://sourceforge.net/projects/nsis/)
and check what are the differences between versions.
But this will help you only if you are a programmer.

Btw, isn't it easier to just install the software from those installers and just grab the files you need after installation is complete?
