- Post Title: Resident Evil Outbreak File 1 and 2 for Ps2 3d model?

Hello to all guys!
 I'm really desperate ... is that for months trying to extract 3d models from Resident Evil Outbreak File 1 and 2 for PS2, unfortunately without success.
 Unfortunately I have a PC that does not support PCSX2 emulator.
 Could someone give me a hand?
 I need a toll pr impossible to extract these 3D models.

 Thanks.
