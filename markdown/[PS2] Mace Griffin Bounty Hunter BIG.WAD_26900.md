Hey there, Xentax. I need your help again.

Can anyone look at this file?
[https://dropmefiles.com/UBGlR](https://dropmefiles.com/UBGlR)

It doesn't look anyhow encrypted or compressed. In fact, it looks quite ripe for the taking, but... it is just too big for me. I'm a bit lost in all the hex. I wonder if someone experienced could take it apart.

All I really want is the dialogue, but on PC version it is in some kind of weird .box format with CB97 header, which looks remotely .wav, yet I've failed to put it together... This .wad archive seem to hold pure .wav files, so if someone can get to them, I would be very thankful.

Thank you, mate, for the script and for the write up on the whole thing. I knew it was an easy archive to crack. Hell, the script looks so simple, I'm almost ashamed - I really need to work on my script-fu...

The files inside are actually vag instead of wav, but since it is a default PS2 format, I have a tool for those.

Thanks!
