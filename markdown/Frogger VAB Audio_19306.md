- Post Title: Frogger VAB Audio

I'm working on creating a modding tool for Frogger (1997). It currently supports the PC sound file format, however the Playstation audio format is a little more complicated.

I've been having trouble figuring out the sound format. A tool I found called PSound seems to be able to extract the sounds, but it's not open-source, so I can't really use it in my modding tool.

I've attached sample files (VB = Body, VH = Header), hopefully someone more experienced than me is able to make progress on this file format.

Thanks!

I don't know if it will be any help for you, but you can also convert these files to WAV using PsxSound 1.0

I have checked it on your samples and it worked fine. 

Good luck with FrogLord. 


Edit:
Try also VABTool  and VAGEdit
