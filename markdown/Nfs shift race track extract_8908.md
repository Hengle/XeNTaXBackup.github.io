Hello! I unpacked the tracks from nfs shift, and i imported 1 in 3dsimed, all good but when i'm exporting it to 3ds max it looks like this [http://img545.imageshack.us/img545/7038/racetrack.jpg](http://img545.imageshack.us/img545/7038/racetrack.jpg) . Does anybody know another way to extract the racetracks from nfs shift ?
