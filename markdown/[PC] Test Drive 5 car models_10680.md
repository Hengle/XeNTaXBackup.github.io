- Post Title: [PC] Test Drive 5 car models

Trying to read Test Drive 5 car models. The format is very simple, basically, a list of vertices with UV info. Nothing about faces. so it works fine if i read it as a trilist like 1 2 3 / 4 5 6 and so on till 540, then it turns into tristrip and changes order few times later as well. do i miss some easy algo? any ideas?

usually i get smth like this. the non-textured triangles on the 2nd screen were drawn manually as well as wrong mesh was removed.
