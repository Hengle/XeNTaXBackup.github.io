- Post Title: .sdat files (playstation 3) decryption method

Hello. Today we'll talk about .sdata encrypted files and HOW to decrypt and then "encrypt" them back.

First, i've to say about why we should know about this.
There are many games which included such file types on ps3, many of them not supported another languages (ie. russian).
And for their translation we need to decrypt this type of files (for example Red Dead Redemption or Demon's Souls).

Second, here is some information about encryption.
Even if .sdata files encrypted, we can create .sdata file without encryption from decrypted file and it will work in a game.
For this purpose you should use a standart SDK programm "make_sdata.exe".
This (and other files we will talk about) here, in sdata-archive: * snip

Next, about how to decrypt them.
Well, this is hard - you need: 1) jailbroken ps3 for real tests (or smbd. who got it) 2)SONY PS3 SDK (I think, you should take DUPLEX 3.40 version) 3) an encrypted file (examples in my sdata-archive).
When the SDK would be downloaded, make all preparations to work with it and go next part:

To decrypt this files we should create a special "game" and run it from game manager, like Multiman.
The question is how to build eboot.bin file we need it for. Well, some part of the answer is here: [http://asmodean.reverse.net/pages/extttdpk.html](http://asmodean.reverse.net/pages/extttdpk.html) 
Let's try to understand what is this all in extttdpk.zip (included in my sdata-archive). 
First, we should to read SDATA-Overview_e.pdf (take it from my sdata-archive).
It says that decryption of this file can be proceed by a function cellFsDataOpen() and other functions, which must be used when you create a game, i.e. EBOOT.BIN.

Ok, let's open extttdpk.zip:
1) extttdpk_v1.exe, extttdpk_v2.exe, extttdpk.cpp are files we no need in them.

folder decrsdat:
2) decrsdat.cpp - source C file we will need to create EBOOT.BIN
3) PS3_GAME folder: it's done folder of our "game"
4) decrsdat.conf & decrsdat.build we no need to modify - it have to use while compiling EBOOT.BIN with decrsdat.cpp.

folder game -> usrdir:
5) decrsdat.lst - simple file where we write about what file we need to decrypt (open with Notepad++). Example:

```
/dev_hdd0/game/LAUN12345/GAMEZ/BLJM60166/PS3_GAME/USRDIR/datadkh.sdat    /dev_usb/datadkh
```

Here we need to decrypt file "datadkh.sdat" (which have placed in /dev_hdd0/game/LAUN12345/GAMEZ/BLJM60166/PS3_GAME/USRDIR/) and place decrypted copy "datadkh" of it in /dev_usb/ (ie. external HDD).

So, here is instruction:
1) Make eboot.bin with SDK & decrsdat.cpp & decrsdat.conf & decrsdat.build.
2) Edit decrsdat.lst with what files you want to decrypt.
3) Place compiled EBOOT.BIN in PS3_GAME\USRDIR
4) Place PS3_GAME folder on internal HDD
5) Run "game" and catch decrypted files on ext.HDD.

Now it is time for my question. Is there somebody who have experience with ps3 SDK?
There are much people who need this EBOOT.BIN.

You can't make a BMS script for something that physically requires a PS3

Can you post the link or info about that ? Specfically the decryption and encryption tool. Unless you are talking about make_sdata.exe .. I dont think I can get that 


Never mind. I found the tools you are talking about. but they are currently in  source code only. So will have to wait for the compiled executables.
