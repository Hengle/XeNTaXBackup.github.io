map game ffxiii so pretty

The DUDE  tell

In the data you extracted with the characters,weapons,etc., there's a "Zone" folder.
You'll see a bunch more folders in there (z000 - z255) and then there's a bunch of bin/bin2 files.
Now in the first data extracted from the disc there's also a "Zone" folder and you'll notice from the file sizes that's where the real zone data is.
Find the large zone file in the original extracted data (like white_z004u_img.x360.bin - for instance - 240.5MB), take a corresponding bin file from the zone folder in the data set you extracted for the characters (filelist_z004u.x360.bin2) copy it over to "white_data\zone" where the large file is and rename it to "filelist_imgu.x360.bin".
Take "white_z004u_img.x360.bin" and rename it to "white_imgu.x360.bin"
Then you should be able to extract everything.
Here's a zone I ripped as proof:
