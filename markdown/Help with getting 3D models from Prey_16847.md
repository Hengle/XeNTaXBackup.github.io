- Post Title: Help with getting 3D models from Prey

Hello.  This is my first time posting since I found this forum while trying to get the 3D models from Prey for a project that I am working on.  This was the only place I could find that was discussing how to get the files, so I hope that someone could help me.  I am trying to get 3D models of the characters from the game so that I can use them to create models in the real world of them.  I take 3D models and then use Slicer for Fusion to get layer cuts of the model and then make them out of various materials for myself.  It's just a hobby for me and I greatly enjoy it.  I'm currently trying to make a desk statue of the Nightmare from Prey.  I was hoping to learn how to do this on my own but seem to be hitting some issues.  I followed what I saw on here and got the files from the pak files, but haven't been able to figure out getting a 3D model.  Could someone assist me with this in either showing me how it is done or if someone has already done it providing where those 3D models are?  I greatly appreciate any help or assistance that can be provided.
