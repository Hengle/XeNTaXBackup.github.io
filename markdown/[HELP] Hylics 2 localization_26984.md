- Post Title: [HELP] Hylics 2 localization

Hello everyone who reads this, I have no experience in translating games, but since Saturday I'm trying to modify the text of this game called Hylics that is made in Unity, I use total commander to know the location of one of the dialogs of the game and I wanted to edit with the option that the program gives, but when I changing the text in that way errors occurred within the game, I try to investigate more about how to modify the text in Unity games, I use a program to see the game code and see where the script with the dialogues are, I could only find texts that are generated randomly (this is  used in a part of the game) If someone is so kind, can they guide me on this?

If you're asking for help when you have zero knowledge about localization, then you're practically asking people to help you from start to finish.
Maybe you'll get lucky and find someone kind who has both the time and will to help you all the way, but that really isn't very likely.

So the best advice I can gvie you at this point is lookup some written tutorials or youtube videos about how to use UABE or UABEA.
Those two are your best bet for localizing Unity games at the moment, since another useful and convenient program called UnityEX is paid and very expensive.

Hello! Thanks for the advice and sorry if I sounded like I want someone to help me with everything, not what I want, just wanted advice as I'm really lost on what to do, thanks again for the advice.

I want to apologize if I sounded like I was blaming you, because I wasn't.

I was just telling you the reality, and how it helps both you and the helpers very much when you know the minimum-required knowledge about localization and know how to ask the right questions.

So once you think you know the basics with UABE / UABEA, but still run into problems somewhere in the middle, then feel free to ask further questions or contact me for help

Of course! When I know how to use the programs you mention, I'll give you news here.
Just one last thing, as I mentioned in the post, I was able to find the random dialogs, only some NPCs use it in a certain part of the game, I saw this using ILSpy to see the code, but I want to translate the normal dialogs first, so I kept looking, but I couldn't find the normal dialogs, when using Total Commander to see where a dialog was located, the program said that it was located in a file called "sharedassets33.assets" and I found the dialog, I edited it from the option that the program gives, then start the game and i went to where the character was but the stage floor disappeared so i figured i don't have to edit the text from there, i really don't know how you can edit those kind of files or if i have to keep searching from the code , I guess I'll have to keep looking at the code to see the location of the dialogs and use the programs that you told me, right?

PS: Sorry if my English is not the best, luckily a friend of mine is also a fan of this game and wants to help me since he knows how to speak English very well.

Your English is just fine, I can understand all of what you're saying without a problem.

But like I said, go learn UABE/UABEA first - I'm pretty sure many of the questions you have including this one will be solved if you do.
My personal recommendation is to use UABEA, since UABE has stopped updating. On the other hand, UABEA is actively being updated and maintained, so it has much better compatibility.

Even though you really should be learning how to use UABEA first, I'll give you a brief explanation of what's going on / what you should do.
I've personally never used Total Commander, so I don't have a 100% accurate idea of what you're doing or doing wrong.
However, if I understood your post correctly, you seem to be directly editing Unity texts/files with Total Commander - which I'm sure you shouldn't be doing.

You should first dump the files into an easily readable and editable format like txt or json with UABEA's dump feature, edit the txt/json files as you need, and then import the edited files back into the asset.
