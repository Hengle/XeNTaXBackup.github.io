- Post Title: The Last Of Us Texture Modding (PS4)

Hey,

I actually released a tool for viewing/extracting the textures quite some time ago. I just added the option to import the modified textures, so wanted to make a thread for it.

Overview : 


Viewing/Exporting
- File -> Open to load the pak file.
- You can see the textures in the list. Select one to preview.
- Use filter to search a specific texture.
- Save DDS/PNG to export textures one by one.
- Export All -> DDS to export all of the textures at once.

Importing
- Modified texture must be saved as dds, and in same format as the original texture (DXT1, DXT5 etc)
- It must have the same resolution as the original.
- It must also have mipmaps.
- Click "Replace Texture" and select your modified texture.

Be sure to backup the original pak files. The tool overwrites the data in the pak.

Ingame screenshots :

Hello! Is there any tools to modify in-game textures in the PS3 version?   Also TLOU on the PS3 version is in PSARC format.

EDIT: found your Naughty Dog texture edtiro tool. Gonna bump that thread there.

I have Net Framework 4.8

run TLOUTexEditor_U1.rar  open file .pak 
The program does not perform any action.

The reason for net 4 or not
