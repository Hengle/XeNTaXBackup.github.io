- Post Title: BPE Compression WWE Smackdown vs Raw 2010 ps2

I am working on modding svr 2010 for ps2.I have been able to add wrestlers from all the games after svr 05.But i am not able to add any wrestler from svr 05,Here comes the pain and Shut Your Mouth.The issue is that the files in all the games that came after svr 05 are BPE compressed but the games i mentioned do not have files in BPE Compressed format.I am able to uncompress BPE files using the Yukes.bms script created by Aluigi.But now i needed a script or a tool that could perform BPE compression so that i could make the files of older games BPE compressed and use them in svr 2010.
I will appreciate if anyone could provide me a script or a compression tool.
Thanks in advance.
