I am just a beginner!<h4>

Today I have downloaded multiex software. And it is great.
But I want to know some things. Maybe somone can help me.
As I was getting an overview about the software, I discovered the multiex scriptor. 

How can I use it. Do i need programming skills to use it? I don't know if it is correct, but I understood with this tool you can create
yourself codes to unpack yet unknown formats of archives. Is this correct?

If anyone can answer my questions I would apriciate it. Thanks in advance.

P.S.: How can I swith the html code on, when I post something?

Hi there, 

Well, the Mex3Scriptor is indeed the tool to start using if you want to add new support. In the program you can select Help and two tutorials can be selected. One is the tutorial for the old MultiEx2(16-bit) that is handy to read first so you get into the feel of scripting archive formats this way, and the other is a tutorial for MultiEx3 script. MultiEx3 script is what you will be using in Mex3Scriptor. 

Try opening game archives with MultiEx Commander and select "view format" from the Tools menu. This way you can view the script that was used on that particular archive format and will teach you perhaps a thing or two about the scripting. 

Yes, using Mex3Scriptor does require knowledge of the scripting language that I created for this purpose, but it is explained in the tutorials.

It is true. The tricks. They are nasty.

Sorry, dudes, but you'll have to live with BBCode.

No problem. Once again. Thank you very much. I believe you are right with nasty things and html. It happened to much. But If you don't want to allow anybody to use it. Then you could possibly remove it from the login assistent (when you register for the first time, there are one entry to use html).

Yeah the entry is there, but it doesn't work, because I've disabled HTML for the entire forum. I may remove it if I find some time, but it's not really high priority.
