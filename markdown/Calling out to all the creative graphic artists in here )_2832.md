- Post Title: Calling out to all the creative graphic artists in here :)

I am currently rebuilding my website [http://www.nickkusters.com](http://www.nickkusters.com) (took my old theme from [http://www.nkcss.com](http://www.nkcss.com) and modified it a bit). I am kind-off looking for a new look and some theme sites for specific products. Are there people in here who would like to create a site design in .psd format form me? It's a private project I do after work and I', not making any money yet (havn't commercially released any software yet), the hosting and domains cost me a few hundred dollar each year, so I am unable to pay for it.

Since we have so many modders here and people who create their own models/graphics/etc, I thought to give it a shot 

Thanks in advance,


Nick Kusters
