Hello,

can anybody tell me, how to modify the ship statistics
for Port Royale 1 ?
I looked inside those *.cpr files, but I found no information about the
ships (like crew, speed, amount of guns).
I would be glad for any help. Thanks.

Hello again,

Finally I managed to extract some files out of the *.cpr archives.
IÂ´m very sure they contain some info about the ships in the game,
but I have no idea how to open these files.

Could anybody please take a look at the attachment and tell me
how to open the *.msk file ?
Sorry for my bad english, many thanks.
