Especially [Binary Templates](http://www.sweetscape.com/010editor/templates.html) distinguish this hex editor from any other.

Looks good indeed! 

It's script reminds me somewhat of Haypo's Hachoir python library:

Looks interesting for sure, installed it at once.  I'm pretty used to Hex Workshop though..

Can't say I'm a fan, it has some crappy registry entries for its shell integration, messing up some of my other registered programs. Removing it did the trick and now all my other programs work again.

Found out that Hex Workshop seems to have a similar feature called Structure Viewer.
Nevertheless 010 is worth mentioning here
