- Post Title: Remember Me - font texture2d

Hi everybody,
 Can I find someone to help me unpack these files?
 I am working on translating a game, and I recently entered this field, and I do not know much about it, so I hope that the responses are clear to someone who is beginning in this field.
 Thank you

What game is it from?

Looks like standard texture2d file from Unreal Engine with some compression.
Did you use gildor's tools?

I managed to unlock the Texture2D, Deletes 305 bits from the beginning and 28 bits from the end And convert the file to dds NVTT.
It remains only to unlock the programming file Arial_Font24.Font.
I hope to find someone to help me with that.

thank you very much.

Is it the original file from the game, or is it the file you created from UDK?

Hi, I also recently translated this game into my language. The main menus have been translated successfully, but when the game starts, the language that I have translated does not appear, but the English language appears between text dialogues between characters. Why?

I am sorry, but I don't know how to modify font files. When I need in texture our characters like ěščř etc. I use gimp and replace our letters with those that are not in our language.
