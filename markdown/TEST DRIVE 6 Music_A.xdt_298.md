We prefer the term "to extract from".   Anyway, I must first find that file somewhere, as I do not have the game!

hi,i too am looking forward to listening to a ftune on the test drive 6 game & would have been easier if i knew WHO sang the sung but i can't find any info on this anywhere.
file is Music_A.xdt
i'am sure  xdt is not used just by test drive.

ANY help in getting that music off of there would be highly appreciated so i can play 100x over & over & over...........etc.

It's really Just 1 song i want to keep listening to>> TY:)

Mayeb you or the other guy can uplad the cut piece of this "file" so we can look at it, as we got nothing to go by yet.
