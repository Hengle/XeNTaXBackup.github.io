I hope I'm in the right forum for this question.
I search a tool like "FMV-Extractor" but it should be able to extract OGG-Vobis files.
Does anybody know a tool which is able to do this?

flawless in ripping Ogg.

Try my [generic file ripper](http://www.turfster.be/FileStripper.rar).
I'm pretty sure I could extract the ogg files from silk road without problems (it's been a while tho).
