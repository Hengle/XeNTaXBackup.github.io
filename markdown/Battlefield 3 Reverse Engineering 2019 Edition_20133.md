I'm making this forum to post to get some clarification as to where and how I should be looking to view BF3 files.

My interest is the ribbons and medals used in the game and I'm aware I can use the battlelog to view them through their CDN but I want the original game files.

The following resources I followed and seem to be outdated and not noob friendly as the devs seem to enjoy using technical vocabulary which isn't necessary when presenting your work to a large audience.:

Most of the problems I'm having is in the python code, Which has a lot of errors and not optimized for quick use. Requires hours of debugging and not clear on what the output is going to be except a .chunk file.

I just want to be able to extract ribbons like this and pure audio files of the game:

Does anyone know how to convert texture + chunk = dds and mesh + chunk = fbx files?
