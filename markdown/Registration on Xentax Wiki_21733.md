- Post Title: Registration on Xentax Wiki

Hello.

I would like to register on [xentax wiki](http://wiki.xentax.com/) but it seems online registration has been turned off (because of spam probably)
I already participated to the wiki long time ago (in 2012) but as anonymous (I should have created one account   )

Is registration still possible ?
Which person should I contact ?
