- Post Title: Replacing models in FFVII PC - Help, please.

Well, I figure I've got nothing to lose and everything to gain by asking here (reviewed the rules, doesn't seem to be against any of them). There's only one other forum that dabbles in this type of stuff, but importing models from other games was deemed against the rules (and I gained interest in doing it too late).

I have been working on understanding how to import Crisis Core and Dissidia models into FFVII PC for 5+ months now.

I've read all that is on: [http://ff7modhd.yolasite.com/tutorials.php](http://ff7modhd.yolasite.com/tutorials.php) and what I could dig up on that other forum I mention.

And as you can see from these screencaps:

[](http://img689.imageshack.us/img689/3151/ffviipcdissidiareplacef.png) (after the head and torso are done, the arms, legs, feet, etc are often were I run into difficulties)


I am really working on it. All I wish to do is something similar to: [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eu30ntvrJGo](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eu30ntvrJGo) and: [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHh4TCrvuJM](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHh4TCrvuJM) (and yes, I've contacted the creator of those videos, he was able to give me.... vague details on how to do it) for my own personal use.

Is there a better, detailed/in-depth tutorial on how to make the models properly? Or someone who remembers how to go about it?

I'm willing to learn, I've spent all this time trying to get it right... I just need a nudge in the right direction to move forward.

Heh, well if nothing else, maybe taking a look at that AC Cloud in Kimera will give me some ideas on how to do the Dissidia model properly.

I agree with jaden, it would be nice to have some place that discussion about this type of modding was allowed, if only because there are those who want to do it for their own ... hm, well "amusement", but the guides that are out there are pretty lacking on details.

True, but I don't mind if it happens. I just enjoy the challenge of modifying the models, and seeing them in-game.

I hope they remake it as well, either for the PS3 (or 4?) or the "NGP" aka PSP2 (or just port it to the NGP from the PS3).

Against all odds, I'd love one HUGE game that comprises everything from Crisis Core, Before Crisis, FFVII, Advent Children/Complete, Dirge of Cerberus and one more game that takes place after DoC.


Jaden, do you know how to go about working with the parts in 3DS Max (or Blender, or any program...)? Or would an attempt at contacting "Philman" at the email address on that site actually work?

Well I sent him an invite/email over msn messenger. All I can do is wait, and continue with my trial/error until I hear back.

Y'know, I never noticed that most of these modding sites are on "yolasite.com".... As for creating a site of my own, I'm not too sure. If I were to make one, I wouldn't want it to become too "popular" and then have S-E on my case.

First Post!

if the Arm is far out because you see other animation (like hit animation or run animation) you need familiarize with that because just why you put other model don't mean you don't need fix animations. namespoofer make a tutorial about that.(but i think in battle models you can't move to fix animations you can just rotate...with this you need more patience to fix it)

Right, when I first started out, I had the ShinRa MP model nearly done (somehow, lol), but then I went through the animations and had parts flying in all directions (mostly, I think, due to all the repositioning and moving I had done to try and make it work).

I know of namespoofer's old tutorial on qhimm, but I know he also had a "modding class" that was (I think) more detailed. Do you have a copy of it?

Ahh I see.

Hm, well I managed to fix his left foot!

[](http://img89.imageshack.us/img89/7879/cloudfoottoe3dsmax.png)

I converted AC Cloud's two parts for his foot and imported them into 3DS Max. Going by how they were positioned, I tried to set the Dissidia parts to the same area.

Result:

Yes, no worries. I did these parts quickly, as a test to see if the positioning would make it work better. Now that it works, I'll go back and fill in what needs to be.

Honestly don't know if I'll release it or not.... that is if I ever manage to finish a fully working model.  

Still having some issues with the feet. The "toe" area keeps moving a bit too much, though I guess it's mainly due to how the original parts worked. Still, has to be a way to correct it slight. After all, the videos ([http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eu30ntvrJGo](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eu30ntvrJGo), [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHh4TCrvuJM](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHh4TCrvuJM), and the others on his page) don't show (or aren't close-up enough) any of the same problems I'm seeing.


Ignore the gap at the end of the leg part, I haven't filled that and that there is bright yellow on the top area of the ported part of the leg... haven't modified the uv-mapping.

I tried my best to have the zipper on the boot match up from the leg to the foot, but doesn't seem like it is 100% possible. If I rotate it enough it looks really good for one animation, but very wrong in another animation.....

Yes, I wanted it to be black, like in Crisis Core. Just used Photoshop a bit (I also made his hair less "bright", so it's more of an orange-yellow).

I'm considering it. It really all depends on how successful I am at finishing it and it looking as good as possible... almost "perfect" if I can.

*edit*

Fixed up the uv-mapping and also edited the "ankle" area of the leg part, so there isn't a gap.

No new progress to show in this post (maybe later tonight or tomorrow), but I just wanted to show that I can also use the original purple colored texture from Dissidia quick and easy.

I'd love to replace some of Cloud's animations from Dissidia... I know that Noesis exports the animation file, but other than that? No clue whatsoever if it's even possible to change the animations or import others.

However, I would expect someone over at [http://forums.qhimm.com/](http://forums.qhimm.com/) would know if it's possible... but I advise against asking about porting anything from another game, it's a "no-no" over there, so just ask about changing animations n' whatnot.

*edit*

These two topics may be of some help:

Did some work on the upper portion of the leg. The uv-mapping for the lower part of it really needs work.... but I'd have to say that it is quite difficult to get it to look right when you're not "amazing" at modifying uv-maps. >_<

Can't port animations. If you want new ones, you'll have to manually edit them yourself.

So I've got a nice update!

Cloud is pretty much 99% done..... although some parts need some major tweaking to get it looking as "perfect" as I'd like (and I'm well aware the old game won't allow it to be nearly as "perfect" as I'd like).

[](http://img337.imageshack.us/img337/7411/cloud100doneneedwork0.png) [](http://img34.imageshack.us/img34/7189/cloud100doneneedwork1.png) [](http://img59.imageshack.us/img59/3310/cloud100doneneedwork2.png) [](http://img404.imageshack.us/img404/6213/cloud100doneneedwork3.png)

(Yes, as you can see I have to finish redoing the left upper-arm and the most obvious is the right arm is rather 'off'... that one piece doesn't like to play fair...)

Wish I could find a way to contact NameSpoofer (or "refoopseman" as I've seen him use that name too)... I managed to contact a friend of his who uploaded videos to YouTube [http://www.youtube.com/user/FF7ModHD](http://www.youtube.com/user/FF7ModHD) but he said NameSpoofer had quit. Still, I'm positive he could give me good advice, or maybe even [http://www.youtube.com/user/umjammerlammy2](http://www.youtube.com/user/umjammerlammy2) will reply to me once again, as I asked about making a tutorial....

*edit*

Just a quick port of the Ultima Weapon from Dissidia (with proper transparency working):

Well nothing back from trishty, or any other modders I've contacted.

I've done a lot of searching and found: [http://vnsharing.net/forum/showpost.php ... stcount=46](http://vnsharing.net/forum/showpost.php?p=3196865&postcount=46) But the password for it (I think it is "Gamevn") doesn't seem to work... All those models would have helped give me a better idea as to how to build them better. 


I've also been reviewing videos and some field models to see how I can improve my Cloud model... but that will take time to do.


Tried to fix the feet when he is going to jump or dash, and have been trying to see if changing the options for bones in each animation frame will help:

[](http://img834.imageshack.us/img834/1999/cloudfoottoeboneadjust.png)

I don't know if it will look "wrong" if it doesn't "bend" like the original though, since I haven't tried changing all the frames to see the full animation.

a bit off-topic but somewhat related: if we want better-looking (even drastically) spells we have to go to texture editing or model editing? or both?

Well, when you say "spells", you mean like "Bolt" and "Ice", etc? Yes, for those you need to do new textures for (actually the Team Avalanche folks have done a few, and they look much better! Bolt looks well... nice! not all pixelated.)

If you're referring to summons, then that would be a combination of both texture and model editing (textures for things like the Moon and such when Odin is summoned).

I meant both, but more about spells than summons  impossible to implement FF8's Apocalypse in FFVII, correct?

Honestly not 100% sure, but I'd think it either may be possible through a ton of editing, or not possible at all.

Oh and here's a comparison between original and new texture for the Odin summon:

Well, I could use opinions on this.

Here is the jumping forward animation with the feet adjusted so the "toe" part doesn't bend:

[http://img51.imageshack.us/i/njf.mp4/](http://img51.imageshack.us/i/njf.mp4/)

Compare with how it looks un-altered:

Two positive reviews so far, that's good! 

Well I just adjusted that one animation, for those two parts. All in all, I guess it took 10min to figure what the best adjustment was, and then to do it for each frame. Of course this was a "minor" edit, so any more adjustments to the 42 animations, well.... who knows.

Taking a slight break from Cloud, and going to a different model. I attempted this one when I first started this challenge......... of, 5-6months ago now?

I also recolored the texture to match the "rusty" color in FFVII.

Crisis Core Sweeper:

I've been reviewing umjammerlammy2's video ([http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MM6zGuFB0aM#t=2m58s](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MM6zGuFB0aM#t=2m58s)), to get an idea of how they went about the leg area, since I noticed following the original parts, may not work out so good (in the last image, the ....uh... well we'll call it the "kneecap").... so I may remove a part and just keep a piece attached to the lower leg area.

You need to fill all holes of your model, edit model location right place on this bone.
Why do you need AC mod by Spoofer?

Thanks! Mike

Will try to do that.

I thought, given what I saw, it had more than just AC models, and had some enemy models done. I learned a lot from looking at the AC Cloud model.

I have some good news to share in this post! 

[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AeHrNbs16hQ](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AeHrNbs16hQ)

That's my video! ^__^ I've made a new YouTube channel "[CloudStrife452](http://www.youtube.com/user/CloudStrife452)", since I didn't want to clutter my other account, [GB452](http://www.youtube.com/user/GB452) (which is actually a secondary one, my primary is [GlitchBob452](http://www.youtube.com/user/GlitchBob452)). All modification videos will be posted there... along with hopefully a really good tutorial as to how to extract/convert/import models into the game.

So I learned something tonight. Despite the fact that most of the Sweepers are just different colors (and I quickly took care of the other two, one being a texture-swap, other other taking a little more time)... changing the file name from "av__" (sweeper) to say "cv__" (custom sweeper) or "je__" (death machine) won't work as one would expect. I found that while the models look fine... the enemies don't act right. I encountered "Custom Sweeper", and it just stood around not attacking for a while, and when it did attack, and "Smoke Shot" appeared on screen..... well, "smoke shot" was not the attack it used, and "Matra Magic" failed to do anything.

Not entirely sure of the reason behind that....

I'd definitely support another FF7 modding forum (Strictly mods and tools, leave the chatter for qhimm).

I'm working on a massive game mod for FF7, but I'm still in the process of gathering the assets... (and i'm a one-man team!) I have plot line setup and some of the other base stuff too.

No work on Cloud so far. I was working on the other Sweepers, and also was [busy with my other 'hobby'](http://rbcorner.com/cgi-bin/eblah/Blah.pl?m-1299092482/). 

The "Custom Sweeper" is pretty much done, and I'm trying to combine some of the models from Crisis Core to make a really awesome looking "Death Machine". Screencaps hopefully up by tonight.

Thanks jaden and Devilot.

I deleted the previous Sweeper video, as I wanted to make a very minor change to the texture (the cylinder in the back was too light imho, so I changed it a bit) so the 'replacement' can be found here: [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVWvHU-qEWk](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVWvHU-qEWk)

Custom Sweeper video here: [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQHjSgPND7w](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQHjSgPND7w) (I had to redo the part that connects the body to the lower legs, kimera wasn't saving the texture group properties for whatever reason and I needed it to use texture 2 being the original sweeper texture, not the custom sweeper main texture which was 0, since it differs slightly from the "regular" Sweeper).

Well I feel silly... I forgot to replace the previous Sweeper files... so that back part I retextured is the same (did a quick comparison between videos).... I'm replacing the files now, and well I guess I'll have yet another upload of it before too long.

Uploading now. I'm glad it takes far less tries to encounter a Sweeper, then it does the Custom Sweeper pair.


Here are two screencaps from the old texture and new..... it's a very subtle difference, but it's there.

Old:


New:

And here is Death Machine:

[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAt_BVzOQ2k](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAt_BVzOQ2k)

I tried to adjust where the gun fire comes out, like I believe I did with the other two Sweepers, but this one didn't go any further (perhaps there is a restriction?). So at the moment it may look a little odd with it showing mid-way.... but it may just have to be that way, or I remove the saws (figured they 'worked' due to the 100 Needles attack). I tried looking into a way to get the saws to spin around, but so far no dice.


So.... opinions on the saws? Should they stay, or go?

I like the new sweeper. textures appear smoother and more detailed (hope this does not mean awful performance hits LOL). will check the death machine later.

Ok, Death Machine has undergone some changes.

First it looked like:



Then I modified the coloring scheme:

Then I decided the saws just weren't worth it if they couldn't be animated and they were replaced with the "pikes" from the "Pile Machine":

I considered playing around with the bones that would normally be the Sweeper's "teeth", to see if moving them to the pikes would cause the 100 Needles attack to come from there, but I don't think it would... however! Now that a general video has been made, I suppose it couldn't hurt.

it really looks like an harbringer of death. Scary. Menacing. Geary. Will love to zap it to garbage with Thunder spells.

A friend asked me if I could change how "Matra Magic" looks, and I've been stumped by it: [http://forums.qhimm.com/index.php?topic=11509.0](http://forums.qhimm.com/index.php?topic=11509.0)

It does look quite funny untextured and not properly sized though:
