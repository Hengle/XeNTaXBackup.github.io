- Post Title: Saints Row IV Character Model

Has anyone tried extracting the saints row iv character models? 

[From what I recall, we had to manually rig saints row 3 meshes after we got them from the game and redo the uv mapping which is a pain on the face mesh.](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=9361)

I really just want the old sr2 shaundi  And some other characters like kinzie. IF possible do tell
