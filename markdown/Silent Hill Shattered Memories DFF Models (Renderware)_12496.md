- Post Title: Silent Hill Shattered Memories DFF Models (Renderware)

Hello! I'm trying to export character models with HEX2OBJ from Silent Hill Shattered Memories Wii version.
The format for 3d models is DFF and textures is TXD same formats than other games with renderware engine.

I can see point clouds without problems

Is possible to export characters with hex2obj "manually" but is complex and takes a lot of time because I need to find the faces , then find the UV

maybe someone that is familiarized with this format could construct a script for noesis, 3ds max or other tool  and make the process more automatic.

here are some examples:

thanks

Note: I used the Ekey tool for unpack the arc files (ARCUnpacker v1.0)

Does it work with the DFF Maxscripts for GTA, or is it vastly different enough?

Well, that's quite a drag. I assume you tried using DFF Analyze on it though?

yes, I used DFF analyze and in some files says "extension 0x03" with empty data and in others "unknown"
