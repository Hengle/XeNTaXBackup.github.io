- Post Title: Metal Gear Solid V:Ground Zeroes, ".wav" in .sbp

Hi. I'm hoping for some help on something probably really stupid. I'm new to this whole "audio ripping" thing but I decided to start because I need to get certain sound files from video games for the purpose of... things. 

Anyhow, so I have a copy of MGSV: Ground Zeroes, yeah? And I manage to use the modding tool from nexusmods to extract the .g0s files and I navigate my way to the sounds and audio and I find all these ".sbp" files. No biggy, just open them up in ravioli explorer and then I see a set of .wwise and .wav files. 

I'm making this thread because while the .wwise files playback and preview with absolutely no problem, the .wav files are unplayable and cannot be previewed. Even if I extract them, they'll force Windows Media Player to crash. I'm lead to believe that they might actually be .ogg files or something but I have no clue on how to convert them except via ww2ogg, which doesn't work. 

I also found no thread on the subject, so I decided to make one. My apologies if there was a good reason no one made a thread on this before.

Hi, you can Import them as RAW DATA in Audacity. It's the only way I've found to play them. (Sorry for my bad english)
