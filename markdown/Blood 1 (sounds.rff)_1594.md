I have had problems trying to support this game - there appears to be 2 different versions of the game or something like that. 1 version has a nice simple structure that it easy to support - the other doesn't appear to have a directory at all - so there is probably some kind of encryption or something in the archive. Sorry mate, but this game isn't all that easy to support

I have succesfully opened sounds.rff (demo version). Could you use the File Cutter (see Game Request Rules below) for your sounds.rff? Perhaps it is a different version of the game?

Also, please email me the log file (debug.log in main directory of MultiEx Commander).
