- Post Title: DARK - How to Edit .fnt and .dds Font

Hi friends
I started to translate a game DARK but it doesn't support some characters, I tried to edit the font file but every time I tried it failed. Could you please tell me how can I edit this font file?

Hi. 
I tried to use this program for the fnt file in the game uncharted 1 and 2, but I think I did something wrong.
 I throw the file I created to the appropriate location, but the texts do not appear. there are only strange shapes on the screen. My goal is to make the font characters (ğ,ş,ı,İ...) not included in the game visible. Uncharted remaster games do not have this problem, but the files there did not work either.. can you help me if you know about this? (Sorry for my English. its from Google translate)
