Good afternoon gentlemen!

The game RignRoll 3 has closed format vehicle archives .wdb - [http://www.mediafire.com/download/7jzkm ... entury.rar](http://www.mediafire.com/download/7jzkmcuv7sa8y4z/Freight_Century.rar)

There is a utility, which pull only texture veh - [http://www.mediafire.com/download/1157p ... exture.rar](http://www.mediafire.com/download/1157pfpdjov1v1n/wdbTexture.rar) (.wdb drag on .exe)

Is it possible meshes veh to pull from .wdb?

I found that there is a second version "wdbTexture". Here is an opportunity "wdb to obj", but it does not work properly. Or rather it is impossible to completely pull the truck...

Here's one (of 18?) submeshes extracted using hex2obj (view link in my sig):

but the model doesn't look nice enough to me to make it worth generating a Make_H2O project.
