- Post Title: Writing Smacker video

Hello all,

I'm surprised not to see  any discussion here of Smacker Video ( [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smacker_video](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smacker_video) ), which was used by over 2000 games before being supplanted by Bink. I am the leader of Project Ironfist ( [www.ironfi.st](http://www.ironfi.st) ), a game mod of Heroes of Might and Magic II, which uses Smacker.  We're looking for help creating new Smacker videos; does anyone know how?

Have you tried The RAD Video Tools ?   There is a smacker compressor.
