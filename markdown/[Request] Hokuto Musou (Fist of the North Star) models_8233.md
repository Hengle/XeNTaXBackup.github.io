- Post Title: [Request] Hokuto Musou (Fist of the North Star) models

I just recently got interested in the Hokuto Musou game and wanted to get my hands on the Kenshiro and Mamiya model that's viewable with NoeSisv.
Unfortunately the threads and link to rapidshare have expired

Could someone be so kind to reupload it?
