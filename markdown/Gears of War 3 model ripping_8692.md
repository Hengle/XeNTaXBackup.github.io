- Post Title: Gears of War 3 model ripping?

Hey guys

I want to rip the GoW3 models into 3DS MAX.
Apparently Gildor's ActorX-Importer can import the files into 3DS.
However, the problem is decompressing the files.
Does anyone know who to decompress the files?


Thanks in advance

Decompressing the files? They're just upks. Standard umodel exporting though you will want to use -md5 on some.
