- Post Title: MuOnline new .BMD models HELP!

Hello!
in muonline there were many decompilers and converters for .BMD (model / object files) which u can view with programm called Pentium tools or convert with another converter.

strangely Webzen (creator of the game) has released at season 7/8/9 and higher versions new .BMD (model) file and when u try to view it or convert it the issue its the .BMD is null!

anyone know how to fix this?

here is one example of a .bmd (without texture)

why not ask in forums where people deal with such?

I used bmdDec.exe (by Luis_br). It created a gigabyte file but the first bytes might be senseful, dunno:

```

```
