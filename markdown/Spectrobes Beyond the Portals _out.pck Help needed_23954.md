This incredibly infamous file is memed about in the DS Hacking community as something impossible to open, but I have a feeling someone here would know how to finally break this ungodly file open.

Basic File Information
The File is not compressed. This was confirmed by DeadSkullzJr in DMs.
This file contains models, animations and textures, etc. The text is stored in a seperate file known as _out_US.pck. This was confirmed by the Spectrobes Modding Discord.
These PCK files are similar enough to the ones used in The World Ends with You for the DS in that Tinke recognizes the unopenable PCKs in there as the exact same. This was confirmed by myself.

The Goal
Extract the files from the PCK file.
Make something that can reinsert files into the PCK file.
Have the created method (BMS Script, Program, SDK Tool) be avalible for anyone in the Spectrobes Discord to use. (Optional. I Don't mind being the only one who can open a file.)

The File
[https://www.dropbox.com/s/mi2ph1gtkcknqs3/_out.zip?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/mi2ph1gtkcknqs3/_out.zip?dl=0)

I wish anyone who looks at the file good luck. I, Nago-San and other people from the Spectrobes discord will still be tinkering with it on the side.
