- Post Title: TGA format problem

While attempting a texture mod of "Die by the Sword" I've realized that with my current TGA editor a problem has come. The problem seems to be that the original (eyes.tga_) is BIGGER than the new one (eyes.tga) hinting that my current tool is using an image compression. Is there any simple to use (and freeware) alternatives that do not compress images this way or a means by which to convert to an uncompressed version that matches the original? I'll provide both for comparison.

Edit: Ok, the problem seems to be that the program I'm using likes to compress the TGA files I save. I can't have this as it crashes the game.

I tried your example with Nconvert, tool to reconvert graphic data, you can get from here:

In your case is:

Alright. The dumb program I have for various image formats loves to use compression. But at least it's free.
