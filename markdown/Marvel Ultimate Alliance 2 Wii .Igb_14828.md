You can ask BLAW, DJSaint, Teancum for a help on Marvel Mods. Teancum & DJSaint still exist around xentax & zenhax, while BLAW has a facebook page under name "Marvin Jean" (Supervisor on Revana)

The MarvelMods.com community has ripped these models using 3dRipperDX and the Dolphin emulator, but we currently have no way of putting models back into the game. Because the camera is far from the player models they can get away with being low poly.

Ok,but i need these models just for me, i don't want to put them in the game.
And a small question,does the 3d Ripper DX still work with Dolphin?
