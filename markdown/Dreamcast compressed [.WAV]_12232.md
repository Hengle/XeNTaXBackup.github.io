- Post Title: Dreamcast compressed? [.WAV]

Hi does anyone know what's wrong with this .WAV file? It appears that it's compressed? How can I decompress it?
I have attatched a Dreamcast .WAV file and the same one from the PC version of the game.

Thanks.

It uses Yamaha ADPCM codec. Can be played / converted using FFmpeg.
