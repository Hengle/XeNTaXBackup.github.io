- Post Title: Invictus Games .rpk / .class

I tried this quickbms script but it doesn't work at all. Are there programs that can decode or compile .rpk and .class files from all Invictus games such as Street Legal Racing: Redline and Cross Racing Championship 2005?
The problem is that StreetLegalMods.com doesn't exist anymore.

Has anyone figured this out?
