- Post Title: World of Final Fantasy .bin Audio Files

Ever since the release of HENkaku, I was able to browse through all the contents from PS Vita games, including World of Final Fantasy. However, my only interest is the audio files.

So I extract the compressed BGM file (which is in .awb format), and then I have these bunch of BIN files. Unfortunately, these files are different from the SFX files because apparently, the ones from SFX files are easy to play them by renaming them to .ADX and then convert it to .WAV using specific tools. Instead, these BGM files are compressed and simply renaming doesn't do the trick either, so I decided to check what's inside the encrypted file and I found this right on top of the header (attachment below).

It says here that the encrypted file is in "RIFF WAVE format". I have tried several audio programs like GoldWave, Audacity, Sound Forge, and received with no results. I was hoping I'm able to extract the file and convert it to .WAV, but no cigar.

Also, I'm not entirely sure if it's in .AT3 format either since I don't see any at3 flags in it. If it is, then this makes things much easier. I think it shouldn't be too hard for these files since they're in "RIFF WAVE format" files, as the picture shows, so we might have 70% - 83% chance to get them extracted.

If you so kind, would you please let me know what type of tool or program should I extract these encrypted BIN audio files?

It's most likely AT9. Post a sample of one of the files

Sure, here you [go](http://www.mediafire.com/file/egwbh803e8663q3/00000052.bin). Also, I've heard about AT9 format before, but I don't quite remember what type of format that is. Is it one of Sony's audio format?
