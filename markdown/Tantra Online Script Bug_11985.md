Anyone can help me fix this script? I bought this from fatduck, but the update was discontinued because of personal issues.

Issue: After exporting the mesh including the animation and tried to import it back, the whole file floats.

I'm willing to pay $50 to fix this script . Need help badly 

The files are inside the Rar [https://www.mediafire.com/?3mb0n3y3wbm8d3n](https://www.mediafire.com/?3mb0n3y3wbm8d3n)

Very nice script!  
I'm not interested in the money nor do I believe being able to solve the issue but I'd like to understand the problem.
I imported the 12 tmb submeshes, saved the scene into a max file and then exported the scene into one tmb.
I imported the dance animation and started it.
Now I chose File New, reimported the all-in-one tmb, imported and started the dance anim.
For me there's no obvious difference.

For me it seems the script exports to tmb without anims.

What do you mean by "the whole file (?= mesh) floats"?
When dancing everything is floating, isn't it?  

In your video I noticed the bottom of the pelvis bone floating a little bit underneath the x axis.
Is it that what you mean?

In my test it was on the x axis (or x/y plane) and from frame 7 a little bit above then jumping
and from frame 73 a little bit below the x/y plane.
But as I wrote I saw no difference between using the anim on the seperately imported sub meshes
or the re-imported all-in-one mesh.

The ISSUE of stop supporting you is because you release/sell my tool to other people!

And now you re-release it AGAIN.

For god's sake...

Just to let you know fatduck, I didn't sell the "bug" script that you sold to us for $300. I was the one who contacted you and became the middle of the conversation, upon waiting for almost a year for the update, and even a single chat for the update we didn't get anything from you. So what I do expect? You are the one who didn't keep the promise first and you are telling us the reason why there's no support for us? I think 1 year is already enough for us to wait for your update, don't act like a kid dude. You have my respect but you're acting like a 6 year old boy here. 

I already said sorry to you even though we are not the ones who didn't kept the promise to give an update after we purchased the "BUG SCRIPT". 

I made a release for this one to ask for help since you are not trying to give us aid after you got the money from us. You are a pro, you should act like one, not some retard little boy.
