- Post Title: Escape From Monkey Island's script

Hi there.

I have a little trouble with translating EMI to my native language - Polish.
Anyone, who has seen game knows that english script is encoded.
I don’t have any tools that can help me decode it, so I'm writing to you.
At the moment, I am translating it in in three steps - german ->english (finding the right lines in a text dump([http://lucasfic.mixnmojo.com/misc/textdump.htm](http://lucasfic.mixnmojo.com/misc/textdump.htm)) ) -> polish. I know that it’s rather unconvenient, but what else can I do?
On this board there are people who are supporting me, but unfortunately, they weren,t able to find a solution to my problem.
So,could you try to decode this file?
You can find it here([http://www.megaupload.com/?d=W2VBHEH0](http://www.megaupload.com/?d=W2VBHEH0))
