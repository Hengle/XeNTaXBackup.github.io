- Post Title: Hero Fighter Extraction?

Some of you may be familiar with a somewhat popular PC game called Hero Fighter. I have been driven CRAZY by it, trying to extract it's graphics. It seems to be a MZ executable file with UPX compression. I unfortunately have yet to find a proper decompiler for such things. I want these graphics pretty bad. There is also a web-based version of it, but of course, the blasted thing is protected by the accursed Mochimedia method (How I hate them...). Anyway, can someone help me get these graphics for my comic?
