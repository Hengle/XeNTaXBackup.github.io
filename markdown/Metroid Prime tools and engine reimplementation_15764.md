- Post Title: Metroid Prime tools and engine reimplementation

Not sure where exactly to create this thread so I hope this is the correct place.

My friend jackoalan and I have been working on various tools to extract files from the Metroid Prime series, and we're getting close to full support for Metroid Prime 1 with Echoes and Corruption lagging behind a bit.
However our project was started with the goal of recreating the engine in order to retarget for multiple platforms (no, we're not planning on distributing Nintendo/Retro assets). Currently the project is still considered pre-alpha, however asset extraction is considered stable.

HECL is a utility for extracting nearly any resource from the Metroid Prime series, currently only MP1 has near complete support, as previously stated, there are only a few formats missing (DCLN, PATH to name two).
Metroid Prime 2 and 3 have full model, skinning, and animation support (with some exceptions in 3 due to how files are referenced, though that should be remedied soon).
We currently do not have an up to date binary package but our source is completely open and available at [https://github.com/AxioDL/urde](https://github.com/AxioDL/urde)

Any ideas, and contributions are more than welcome.

Here is an example of what HECL is able to accomplish:
