- Post Title: MDK 2 - HD .mod File

hello dear xentax community,

i'd like to ask if there's a possibility of getting a working script for Noesis, 3Dsmax (11/12) or Blender
for the .mod file format from the Game "MDK2-HD".
the game should run on the "Omen Engine" if i'm not mistaken.

i was able to simply extract all of the files from the game out of the mdk2.tar file with 7zip.
inside are .dds, .wav and .mod files (which contain -im pretty sure of it- the mesh files).
unfortunately no known 3d program can open it by default.
so i would like to ask kindly if someone could have a look at this file format.
i would love to have Kurt and Max inside of 3Dsmax. 
so much nostalgia.

thanks for reading

file attached: Kurt and Max (+dds files) in .7zip format
