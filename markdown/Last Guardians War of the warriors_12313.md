- Post Title: Last Guardians: War of the warriors

Last Guardians is completely an action game, which I like the exciting fighting and combat skills. I play as an adventurer in the game, seek to conquest with others in the mysterious and adventurous land. This game is fantastic, the graphic is 3D and amazing, sound effect is excellence, combat skills is extremely good. I love the exiting fighting battles, different mysterious adventure, and unique visual effect. This is the combat game which is the blending of the conquest and exploration.
