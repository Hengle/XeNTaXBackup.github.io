- Post Title: Creating MultiEx ActiveX Plugins

Those of you wanting to have a go at creating ActiveX plugins (MexCom plugins, not RPM) for MultiEx Commander, here are the functions you should create. 


Creating your own ActiveX DLL Plug-in



As a programmer, you can create your own ActiveX DLL to include additional games for support within MultiEx Commander. Thus, if you know how to handle a GRAF that is not supported yet by MultiEx Commander, you can make one yourself this way.

For MultiEx Commander to be able to work with it there are a number of things that need to be taken care of.

1. Create a directory in the plug-in dir of MultiEx Commander

Create a directory named after the extension of the GRA you wish to support, if it does not exist yet. So, if you want to support a *.LIB file from Game A, you create a dir named â€œlibâ€
