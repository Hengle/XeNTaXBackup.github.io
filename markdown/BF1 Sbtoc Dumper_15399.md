Hello everyone, I have modified Frankelstner's BF4/SWBF dumper scripts to work with Battlefield 1

YouTube video [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mU5tuuwVKaY)

You can get the scripts [Here](https://mega.nz/file/aZpDHBTK#-JnFq-V_x5qdqwgrEdm95wYFdLv-gOI9wSQkDl1Yry0)
Make sure you use python 2.7.6 32bit

Thanks a lot. I actually had to install the 32-bit version of Python on my 64-bit system for some reason, but it's working now. Are you planning on updating the scripts? I doesn't seem to extract the Cutscene audio files.
