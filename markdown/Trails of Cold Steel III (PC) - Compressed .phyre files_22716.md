- Post Title: Trails of Cold Steel III (PC) - Compressed .phyre files

[https://anonymousfiles.io/GHRvAX9s/](https://anonymousfiles.io/GHRvAX9s/)
The .phyre files I extracted from the .PKG files from the Trails of Cold Steel 3 PC Demo, seem to be compressed or corrupted from the ones used in the previous Trails of Cold Steel games and other Falcom-developed games.
