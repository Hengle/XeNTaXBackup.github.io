- Post Title: [Unity] Ori And The Will Of The Wisps

So I recently picked this game up on Gamepass to dump it and look at the files but the Unity asset files don't seem to play nicely with Perfares AssetStudio.
[https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/ ... nknown.png](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/143402852289609729/734423366903005224/unknown.png) The object list has no names, and jumping to it from assets in the asset list doesn't work.
All animators are named with just underscores and a bunch of them crash when exporting.

I have managed to grab the model and some textures for Ori but because the object list and animators are broken, I can't get a rig. And automatic texture export alongside the model doesn't happen. I can send samples of the main shared assets files, as I know which one has Ori in it, but I'll only send if needed because it's around 600mb if I remember correctly.

I should mention too that I posted an issue on the AssetStudio GitHub for this, but the project seems to have been inactive for a while...so I'm not getting my hopes up for an official fix.

I first asked about this on Zenhax, but i thought i may as well ask here too.

There does seem to be a lot of strings in the files. A bunch of which aren't asset names...so now im not sure.

Anyone got any ideas on this? Just want to grab models with rigging.
