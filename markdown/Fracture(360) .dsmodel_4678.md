There are several models in the larger .dsmodel. There are at least 2 different model formats in that file. The vertex data is stored in 44Byte arrays, however only the vertexes are stored in standard 4bytefloats. The face index is group of arrays of 3 vertexes that are joined to make a face:

wow thank you sir furryfan for replying to this thread!  i almost thought that no one will help me out  

i know that i'm asking a bit too much, but can you post the procedure on how you extracted the necessary data out of it to be saved as blend file or obj? I'm really noob at this, so please pardon me  btw i'm using ultraedit, because i can't navigate well with cheatengine.

thank you again sir FurryFan!
