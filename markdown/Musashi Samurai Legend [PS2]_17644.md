- Post Title: Musashi: Samurai Legend [PS2]

This game featured a lot of interesting character models, enemies and effects such as bodily dismemberment, physical skeletons and character outlines. Not to mention the soundtrack was awesome.

I'm not fit to do any work on exploring this game's innards, but this is a game research forum, so I figured someone might be interested in cracking this open. I don't think anyone has attempted it yet, anyways. I've been doing periodic searches on models and stuff for this game for a long time, so I figured I might as well bring it up! What's the harm, right?

I was going to try and put a few shots in the dark, but the only thing I've really ripped into at this point is a .bin file with QuickBMS using someone else's code. This game seems to have much of its depth in a file called "SLUS_209.83," which pretty much leaves me at a loss for what to do with it.

Feel free to look into it or disregard!
