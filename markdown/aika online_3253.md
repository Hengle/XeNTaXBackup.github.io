Well, just tried AIKA and dang it's hard with korean games where you have no idea where to go  And, impossible to rip now that they use xtrap and hackshield. It disables everything 

Here is a screenie at least from the beginning of the game

Bumping this thread because I like the models so much

Perhaps also reupload some files. The files in the first post are now not downloadable. You wish to open an archive, right?

If the files have some salient magics (those usually 4 byte strings at the beginning of a section or file) you can try and load into the exe into IDA Disassembler and try to find the loading routines with those strings.
I can't do it, don't have the time.

I'm not sure what you mean. I have no such problem with DXT3, here's you're example (These do not have MIP maps, mind you, just a single screen).

Simply open the jit file with an hex editor.

Then, replace the fake JT31, JT33, JT35 fake header with proper DXT1, 3, 5 header, and edit the file size also (most of files beeing 04x04 or 02x02, which is 512x512 & 256&256)

I wish someone could give me some tips about aika's bin files decrypting..I even got a crypted file and the same one decrypted, but still haven't managed to get the "magic recipe" :/

I added the .msh and the .jit loader module to the 3D Object Converter and I released the v4.422 now.

You can install or use the portable v4.40.
[http://web.t-online.hu/karpo](http://web.t-online.hu/karpo)

After that you can update your installed (or portable) application (version>=4.0) quickly and easily using the auto-update function (Help/Check for updates…) to get the latest version of the 3D O. C.

@Karpati:

Thank you so much! But, whenever I try to load a .jit file, it gives me an error saying "Error opening [filename].jit". I DID update to the latest version, v4.422 first.

The .msh files load just fine, just not the .jits.

seculi017,

You have right because my program searches the texture file in the same directory than the model file exists.

You can modify it using the Options/Import parameters:
Default texture subdirectory:                                                ..\texture
Use the default texture subdirectory for textured view:      checked

If you need use the  'Save' and the 'Apply' buttons.

I'm pretty handy with texture editing, if that's what you mean, but I suck at the technical mumbo-jumbo. If you can get the textures out and back into the game, I can edit them for you.

hey all new here but i play aika

im trying to convert those JIT image files from with what MissCooky said but i still get photoshop complaining.

Could you explain in a little more detail what exactly i have to do.

here is what i have from one image (the ÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿ   UUUUÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿ bit being the start of the data):

```
JT33€   €   ÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿ   UUUUÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿ
```


do i replace JT33 bit to the DXT3 bit like:

```
                                                      DXT3                    @                 ÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿ   UUUUÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿ
```


the file i got this from was "FFSWD00009EF.jit"

now when i tried using a header from the download that chrrox gave it still complained so either im being a dumbass or im not doing somthing right.

In the last days I developed the new FREE internal export module called 'Tools/Export the material table's textures to .bmp files'. that supports the Aika Online jit format.

See the Supported texture file formats:

I released the 3D O. C. V4.429 update package now.

Sorry to revive this thread. Has anyone looked into this? I've been trying to convert .dds files to .jit but have had no luck in figuring out how. I can only go .jit -> .dds cause of the converter program provided by this forum.

It seems as if all progression towards this came to an abrupt stop. No one even said anything.

Am I the only one who wants to see this progress? The models in this game are truly stunning..

I've spent hours and hours trying to figure out how to convert .dds into .jit ;/

Moreover, Karpati's 3D Object converter isn't working for the .jit files as it say's its suppose to.

My program works correctly on the .jit files.
What program version are you running ?

Sorry for saying that then, I must be doing something wrong.
I'm using version 4.434, and I also have the "Use default texture subdirectory for textured view" option checked in tools -> options -> import.

Thanks.

-Open you .msh file (it will add the *.jit texture names to the material table automatically.
-Use Tools/'Export the material table's textures to .bmp files' function

It works, is there a way to reverse the process? (i.e bmp -> .jit) ?

I wrote a simple script to add dds header to Aika's JIS texture,but there is something wrong.The resulting texture is not correct.
Maybe it's because i didn't give proper value to dds flag.plz help to finish this simple script.

```
   heapSize = 200000000 -- allow ~ 40 MB instead of just 7.5 MB. Prevents "Runtime Error: Out of scripter memory"
clearlistener()
fname = getOpenFileName \
caption:"Open Aika Texture File" \

> Sorry to revive this thread. Has anyone looked into this? I've been trying to convert .dds files to .jit but have had no luck in figuring out how. I can only go .jit -> .dds cause of the converter program provided by this forum.

Can I get a link to this jit to dds converter? xD
