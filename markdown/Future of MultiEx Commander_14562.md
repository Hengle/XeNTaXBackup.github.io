- Post Title: Future of MultiEx Commander?

I have to be honest, I haven't used MultiEx Commander at all but I just installed it now to start hacking away at a game archive. What is the future looking like for this program? It doesn't appear to run very well on Windows 10 and I'm wondering if there are any plans to work on compatibility and maybe move away from the ActiveX implementation scheme?
