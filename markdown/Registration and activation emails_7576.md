- Post Title: Registration and activation emails

We have seen that a number of users have multiple accounts, and some are inactive. 
We also get the occasional complaint that people do not receive activation emails. 

1. The NUMBER 1 reason for this is that you have a strict spamfilter. Check this first !

2. Also, make sure you use a valid email address! There are people that put one in, but forgot the login for that email address, and then register another account. 

3. When you change you profile settings, you must reactivate. You will be send a message. Check your spamfolder if you have not received one. 

If all fails, come to us.
