- Post Title: wav munch's oddysee xbox -> pc

I need to convert the WAV audio files of this game to make a full translation but I can't because there is a special encryption. The files are encoded with xbox adpcm codec but is impossible to convert them in normal pcm wav. I tried with aluigi's tool, with xbox adpcm codec and many decoder software but I fail for that special encryption. 

Each file begin with this encryption:  defT.8..  (64 65 66 54 80 38 01 00)

Here there a pack of files.
