- Post Title: Dragon ball FighterZ - modding HELP

Hello XeNTaX Community!

My name is Hyo-Sin,

I'm from a discord group called "DBFZ Workshop",
i've talked there about modding certain characters and i cant mod properly myself 
in the end they said that you needed someone with special knowledge about Unreal Engine to properly make the mod.
so that's why i am posting here in hope of salvation.

so i wanted to ask someone here
if they could please make a mod for the DBFZ community and me,
on the Game  "Dragon Ball FighterZ".

there are already a ton of mods out there
but each has their own failures/buggs whatever you might call it,

for example : 
Vegeta Super Saiyajin into Majin Vegeta  
has chunky thick outlines which i don't like
i want the same graphics as ingame so you barely can tell the difference and don't notice the mods, if you know what i mean.

also 
Goku Super Saiyajin into Super Saiyajin 3 
his mouth animation does not move and its a "swap"

so what i want is : 
a mod for Goku BLUE into Super Saiyan 3 
and a mod for Vegeta BLUE into Majin Vegeta

i don't want any thick outlines or animation losses.
for more questions just ask and i'll respond.

i hope someone is willing to help me.


sincerely,

Hyo-Sin

Are you sure there is no such mod yet? As far as I know, there are sites where all the mods for Dragon ball FighterZ are collected and there are sooooo many of them
