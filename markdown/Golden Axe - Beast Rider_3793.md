Thanks for the model files mario_Kart,

I will archive these onto my drive in hopes that someone can hopefully extract and convert them to a usable format such as .3ds, .obj, or even better yet .dae.
I don't have the know how to do it myself yet, and I would love to play with her (pose, render, etc)   

I think Tyris Flare is one of the best made game girls out there right now created by Sze Jones also one of the best IMO! Check out her website and see some other work she's part of.

Hi!

I´m trying to learn with pkg files (Iron man and Golden axe ones, only differs about IM ones have data block encripted with ZLIB). But my real problem now is how to find in wich part of all the files inside the pkg are the vertex and such kind of things. All the rest, header,ofsts structure... is no problem, the problemis to find vertexes. After that I´ll need to learn to do some scripts, but right now till I can reach the point of find vertexes I´m lost...

Thanks in advance!

As totally noob and after 1 week working on pkg files I discover a lot of things, but I can not find the clue that point me into where meshes info are (right nnow trying to find vertexes...) so I´m driving myself crazy   

 I´ve got some ideas, firstly is that that info must be in third data block as in two first ones are (following my schemes) gpu data and surface resident data (normal, diffuse... probably textures). 
I also suppose that this kind of data is big endian ones (because XBOX 360 is). But it doesn´t matter how much I read or look for or test, I still can not find anything that gives me some light 

I´m going to attack an excel file with names, addresses and most of things and explantions I was finding (and also tested).

Hope anyone could give me a helping hand

Anyone could help? I knew vertexes must be 3 floats per coordinate but can not find a pattern that fits vn,vt or faces.

I figure out something like this on block 3 of data but can not guess exactly the way, for example in the next one 

00000000 00000004 00000008 00000044 
00000002 00001801 00000005 00000014 
00000000 0001C00A 00000005 00000014 
00000550                            

there is fixed values only changes the 44 and the 550 and it match with vertex and ofset end in vertex block. Also I believe faces are stored in ib blocks but lenght didn´t match at all (at least with an standard f v1/vn1/vt1,v2/vn2/vt2,v3/vn3/vt3

Thanks for your answer

Finally did it (faces list writed by hand), thanks to Chrrox who corroborates I was looking right where i needed to look, after that and a lot of google find new concepts and ways of writting faces in a file. Now I need to refine better and do some code to automate the process.

It´s not an impressive pc, but it was done all by hand

Thanks!

Right now I´m learning quickbms to do the script for that. After I´ll apply to Iron Man pkg files. Probably I´ll see about textures but not sure yet about it and bones, because I only need models.

i had it working, but then my script got seriously messed up. I tried to fix it, but I gave up for months.. going back to it, I've just got no sense of what I did.
chrrox was also able to read the models, but he was just scanning through the files, not actually reading through the file structure.

its not that complex, but its like a container, in a container, then everything read from this index and that index.. its too much work for these models. I was kind hoping someone else would do it.

all the images from this game are swizzled you need to create an xpr texture out of them then extract it using the Microsoft sdk tool unbundler.

Anybody can help me? I can't figure out how extract the xpr textures from the pkg files, 

EDIT: , i need to extract them manually with an hex editor, right? what about the xpr headers?
         Is there a quickbms script to save time?

Hi mario, how did you unswizzle properly the textures? Did you find some similarity with other xbox360 game textures?
I think that unzwizzling these textures manually it should be quite long ,right?

took me about 3months to crack it, but i recorded the paintshop operations to a microscript.. so I can unswizzle any standard swizzled texture.
not that it matters, since the 360 SDK was leaked you can use the SDK tools to do the dirty work for you. however the textures above were obtained with my own texture work.
as it turns out the 360 swizzle is just a pixel tiling process, in which the pixels get grouped and sorta overlapped or aligned in a certain manner.

being nothing is compressed during that process, you can easily re-work the pixels like a puzzle. whichc is how I did it before, as I don't have the programing experience to do it otherwise. again with the leaked sdk, you could get the sdk to do the work for you.

Thank you so much Mario for the explanation.
So I will try with SDK tools as first attempt and if i won't succeed i 'll try with your method.

Not to be the guy that digs old threads back out from the grave, but I was having a look into this and wanted to see if anyone out there got anywhere with it. I've managed to extract .dat files from the .pkg files using Offzip, but am at a bit of a loss as to where to go from here. Was anyone ever able to get the textures and models out beyond the one shown?
