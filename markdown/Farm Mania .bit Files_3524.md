Not compressed.
First part might be crypted, at least it's too short to be a palette.
Which resolution does the game use?

Hmm, that wasn't a difficult format, though.   

```
uint32		Width
uint32		Heigth

[768]		Colour Table (256 colours, in RGB format, 8 bit)
[width*heigth]	Pixel data

```

When you deal with a lot of difficult stuff, it's easy to think too complex when you're staring at something simple. I have that too.
