- Post Title: spider-man 2002 game

I know the game is old but I'm really interested in it.
The models are compressed in '.pkg' but I never founded any extractor (the audio and video files are '.bik' files, simply openeable with some players).
Now, I want to extract the animations of the game (web swinging animations in particular), so analyzing all the folders I leaned that the ones that I want are in the files 'SWING1.pkg', 'SWING2.pkg' and 'SWING3.pkg' or in the files of the same models. So I hope that somebody can give me some advices on how to extract or if would analyze the files here them are:
