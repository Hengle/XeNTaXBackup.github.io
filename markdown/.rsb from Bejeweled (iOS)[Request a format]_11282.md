- Post Title: *.rsb from Bejeweled (iOS)[Request a format]

Hi there, 
I use [http://aluigi.altervista.org/papers/bms/others/1bsr.bms](http://aluigi.altervista.org/papers/bms/others/1bsr.bms) to extract the file main.rsb, which is a resources file of Bejeweled, 
the script seems expired for the new version file.

you can download the game from iTunes:[https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/bejewel ... 36744?mt=8](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/bejeweled/id479536744?mt=8)

This question is same as the early post : [viewtopic.php?f=10&t=10858&hilit=main.rsb](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=10858&hilit=main.rsb)
But it's not clear for me. 

I upload the header and tail with 256kb size.
