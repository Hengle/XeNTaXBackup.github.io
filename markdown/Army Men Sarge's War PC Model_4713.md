- Post Title: Army Men: Sarge's War PC Model

I have been trying to get the model of Sarge from this game. The Installer halts at the directory section because of compatibility issues with setup_wm.exe, so I have to search Data1.cab. I am just wondering which file contains Sarge's model. If anyone knows, I'd appreciate it if they'd let me know.
