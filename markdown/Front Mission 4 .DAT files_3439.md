- Post Title: Front Mission 4 .DAT files

I've pretty much hit a wall trying to figure out what to do with the .DAT files I extracted from Front Mission 4 using Munge Explorer.

It's obvious they are containers of some sort. I'm theorizing they are identical in some way to FFXI's DAT files, since FFXI (both the PC versions and PS2 versions, at least) used the same system of storing the files. They most likely contain all the data, such as textures, models, etc. Unfortunately, since there doesn't seem to be a model viewer that allows loading of DAT (most pull from a list), I can't test this theory. I doubt the dats from this game would open in a FFXI model viewer though.

I was hoping someone could assist me in cracking these things open, as I have no experience whatsoever with reverse engineering.

And before you ask, yes I did try ripping these with 3Dripper and other methods, unfortunately all the rips were either flat, unusable jumbles of polygons, or nothing at all.

All the DAT files together are 1.02gb. if it's stored the same way as the FFXI data the data will be spread across all the files.

Files are gonna take a while, so I'll post them when they finish uploading.

EDIT: Download link added.

Has anyone had a chance to look at these yet?
