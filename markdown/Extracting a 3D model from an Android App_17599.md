- Post Title: Extracting a 3D model from an Android App

Hi guys!

I am trying to make a sculpture for my gf's birthday next month, but since I lack the artistic skills I thought about 3D printing the sculpture and making a mold after it and cast it in clay.
The problem is that there is no one that would sell me the 3D model, I've tried talking with the guys who made a 3D scan of it, offering to pay for it but no luck.

The sculpture in question is Brancusi's Cumintenia Pamantului.

But, I found an android app that has the 3D scan model in it. 
The problem is that I do not know how to get it out of there.

I've searched the web for a tutorial but I'm afraid that nothing really helps  

Is there a tutorial for dummies on how to extract a 3D model out of an Android app?
The app uses Unity, and is named Cumintenia Calatoreste if anybody is interested.

includes blender obj and fbx and textures and normal maps. I'm sure you don't need the textures for printing, but... can be used as reference. maybe you can give the printed model some color and shade. paint with sponge may work to slightly texture it, i could imagine. the normal maps are useless tho.
