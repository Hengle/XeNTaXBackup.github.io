Looks like umodel doesn't play well with this game, so I decided to make something my own for getting couple of chars. Only skinned meshes and textures are supported. Automatic material mapping and static meshes are not supported.

Note :  This has been tested with the client downloaded from Steam. I don't know about any other versions.

Tool overview and example exported model



How to use

Load

UPK : Loads the skinned meshes and textures inside the UPK file.
Note  : Some models take long time to load.
Export

NEX : Exports the model in custom binary format (.nex), intended to be loaded by Noesis. Noesis script for this format : Nex Script
PNG : Exports all the textures in PNG format.
Note  : Models and textures will be exported into the folder Export.

Ok, it's a pity. I like its scene map very much. I have been looking for it for quite some time. But thank you for your tools. You are really a genius!

Hello akderebur, first of all thanks alot for your tool!, It work on most models. I wanted to get a hammer weapon,it loads, but doesn't show all the meshes that the .upk have, maybe do you have any idea how to edit it or something? Thanks!
