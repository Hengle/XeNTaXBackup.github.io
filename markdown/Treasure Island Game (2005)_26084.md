- Post Title: Treasure Island Game (2005)

I been 3 days trying to find the animations/sprites of the characters in game,but all i could find is music,sounds,backgrounds and objects that are still in the DATA folder. All characters that have animation are nowhere to be seen.
I tried to find anything to extract the exe and dll files but i get files with no extensions,if someone could help me i would be very thankful.The game is in Russian and here's a download link: [https://www.old-games.ru/game/download/11211.html](https://www.old-games.ru/game/download/11211.html)
