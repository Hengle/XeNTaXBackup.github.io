- Post Title: Rebel Raiders Operation Nighthawk Gamerip help

Well, I've had a hard time remaining patient about the gamerip and decided to do this myself. Much of the stuff I tried failed (Game Extractor failed to work, etc.) and I finally made some progress with QuickBMS, but now I'm presented with a bit of a quandry. All the music I extracted from the data.bag file is in a strange .mic format, which I can't do anything with. Can someone help me with this?

Edit: Tried MultiEx Commander with a script I found and was successful.

Hi, 

Which script for MutiEx Commander was that? For the .bag or .mic files?
