I'd like to extract the 3d models of the game One Piece Burning Blood. When i extract the .cpk files i get a bunch of .scz files and i don't know how to open them...    I'd appreciate any help.

Here's a link for a sample file: [http://www.mediafire.com/download/u61ew ... sample.rar](http://www.mediafire.com/download/u61ewjr755dqaj8/sample.rar)

They can be dumped from ram.

The game .cpk archives can be decompressed using the same tools as Xenoverse, that gives a lot of .scz files.
I haven't tried but it seems that these .scz can be processed with this quickBMS script: [http://forum.17907.n7.nabble.com/file/n1422/OPBB.txt](http://forum.17907.n7.nabble.com/file/n1422/OPBB.txt)
Now I think your script is needed to load the npk and similar files.

Ook, so the remaining problem is to unpack the .scz files.

Sorry for the question, but what did you do to dump the models from ram on the PC version?
If it's possible to get them using your way we can avoid to decrypt the .scz

you need to find them using a hex editor.
I use process hacker [http://processhacker.sourceforge.net/](http://processhacker.sourceforge.net/)
to dump the memory to disk then search using a hex editor for the files.

I'll try!
The only thing I ask is what do I have to search for using the Hex editor?
I don't think they are saved as .fbx files!

How do I know I found a 3D model?

EDIT
From what I looked at, it's possible to obtain unpacked (npk, npki...) files using the dump, isn't it right?
I still haven't understood how to do but I only did a fast check!

After that you script loads these files into Noesis, am I correct?

EDIT2
From what you load here [https://i.snag.gy/HCmj5s.jpg](https://i.snag.gy/HCmj5s.jpg) , it seems that npak is what you are searching for, and I think I even understood how to extract them from the dump.

You need 3 files.
npak(npk), npki, npkv

Are there any news about this game extraction?

I've seen that some progresses on the game compression were made some time ago, but nothing more after that.

The cmp_scz script decompress the files perfectly  [http://aluigi.altervista.org/bms/cmp_scz.bms](http://aluigi.altervista.org/bms/cmp_scz.bms)
Please share the script, please this game has the best One Piece models, yes I know about the mobile dance game, but those are low poly.

I too would like this script. There's a select number of characters who only appear in this game and I would like to acquire their models.

People like scripts, yeah.  The unpacking script is available since about a year now. Why not check the resulting npki?

Hi there, Andy 97/Hiroshi and I made a Noesis plugin for this format. [viewtopic.php?f=16&t=21863#p160926](https://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=21863#p160926)
Thanks for your tutos shakotay and chrrox.
