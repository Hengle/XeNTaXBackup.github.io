- Post Title: Dungeon Siege 2 .ds2map archives won't open

It's really a wonderful program, the Game Extractor. Should've found this earlier  As the subject states, I tried to open a .ds2map archive from my Dungeon Siege 2 folder.

The program told me that there were no available plugins for this archive, although it is listed in the supported games list, even with the same extension.

Am I doing something wrong or isn't it fully supported yet? Thx in advance!

I can't help you. This is the MultiEx Commander troubleshooting forum, payed for by the developers of the program, XeNTaX 
( [http://www.xentax.com](http://www.xentax.com) ) .  

MultiEx Commander does the same stuff that Game Extractor does, yet it's not the same tool.

You might bump into Watto, the developer of GE, here though.

Hi mate,

Yes, Game Extractor does open the archives from Dungeon Siege 2, however support for this game was only added in the latest update.

If you have the full version of Game Extractor, you can download and install the latest update available on the downloads page.

If you have the basic version of Game Extractor, then you will just have to wait until I upload a newer version to SourceForge.

Thus one of the benifits of purchasing the full version is regular updates. I will probably be uploading a newer Basic Version sometime over the next few days, if not tonight, so look out for it if you don't want to pay for the full version yet.
