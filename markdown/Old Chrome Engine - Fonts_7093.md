Could you post a screenshot of the font in action?
I could imagine that the letters are made only of "ff"s and "00". So it would be nice to know the actual dimension (height, width) of one letter. But maybe im just wrong. Anyway pls post a picture

I hoped to make out the height and width from a screenshot to search in widthxheight patterns for the letters in the file but... I was not able to make anything out. Besides that the font in the screenshot does not look like a MS San Serif.
