- Post Title: any easy 2d games to mod?

the word easy is subjective...lets just say i am way noob modder most of my modding involves some sort of program that does the modding for you



however i have actively modded simple rockets 1

done all i can with that game looking for other games that are similar in simplistic coding

i prefer 2d cause less code to deal with. fun free games that are easy to mod for practice. i dont really do the game developing myself because im still learning but dont wanna deep dive just yet into the stress that is coding your own game lol ive made a few games using rpgmakermv but thats a whole other ball game. anyways any help would be cool. i do enjoy just jumping into code and editing then getting the hang of it and creating my own stuff within the game any ideas help.
