- Post Title: Extract Models and Textures from PS4/PS3 Games

Hello,

i just searched in Google and in this forum for the information on how to extract 3D Models and Textures so that i can import the models to Blender and the textures to GIMP for example. I am particularly interested in the Game „Yakuza Ishin“ , also known as „Ryu ga Gotoku Ishin“ , the game is available as a Japan Import, for both PS3 and PS4

could someone put me to the right direction? Thanks in Advance 

PS : i am sorry for not being able to figure this out by myself

Ok, got it working. The models are in .gmd format. you can import the .gmd files with the python script for blender 2.49b, posted here : [https://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?t=8891&start=45](https://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?t=8891&start=45)

PSARC files are Plastation Archive files, which then get extracted into PKG files, which are Packages, its another archive, so you have to extract those PKG files into their file formats, there is no 'ps3 or ps4' file format, almost all games are different because developers use different engines.
You'll want to extract those PKG fies and see what you get out of it, then maybe share those in their own topic and see if anyones able to look into them.
