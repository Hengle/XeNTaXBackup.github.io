- Post Title: Disgaea 4 (PS3) Font Format

Hello everyone,

I'm trying to figure out how to edit the font files for a fan translation we're doing.
The font format in that game is a .ffm file that seems to be a pointer to the texture font contained 
in the font.lzs file, which is apparently an encrypted format (decrypts to a .txf file).

The issue is that after translating the other files from the game, some unusual behavior happens, 
like double spacing and some characters do not show, like the apostrophe ('). 

I've put both font files and the decrypter on the link below, since i was having error 500 when trying to upload it here.

Any help will be greatly appreciated.
