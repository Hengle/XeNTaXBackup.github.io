- Post Title: The Punisher 2005 Characters And Weapons Models Ripped

Hello.
In this post you will find the characters and weapons from The Punisher 2005 finally being ripped.
I want to say two things first:
 -I included ALL the weapons, but I have not included the upgrades they have.
-They are not absolutely ALL the characters, only the ones that I consider relevant and UNIQUE. Example: relevant: Takagi
Unique: Takagi Geisha.
File Format: OBJ
Texture Format: DDS
Author of Rip: Nappa Saiyan
At the end of the post you will have a Link with all the weapons and all the characters. This in case you don't want to download them individually.

Characters:

Weapons

(It should be noted that in some cases the magazine will be in the wrong position, this happens because upgraded weapons have independent models of their magazines. Just place the magazine where it should.)

Oh, and here is an example of a fixed up magazine.
Simply select the faces with Edit Mode, detach the selection and drag it to its correct position.

Hi guys!
On Sketchfab I posted the same models as here.
But the guns have the correct magazine position.

Hello! In sketchfab I will be uploading more models, since it is the fastest and most efficient medium, since it does not have any publication approval system!
Everything will be free to download, don't worry.

Hi.
I have already published more than 110 models!
Obviously, all this in Sketchfab.
I'm done with the relevant characters, and with the weapons.
Now, I will go with all the enemies and secondary NPCs.
I don't know how long it will take me, but I've already taken it a little seriously.

Hi everyone!
In Sketchfab I am updating some models that do not convince me.
Here's an example, Kreigkopf.
As can be seen in the image, it was previously imported into Blender with its mouth open.
I have also updated Nick Fury, now he has the cigar in his mouth and with the textures correctly applied.
I plan to update "The Russian" "Bushwacker" and "Ma Gnucci" all of them have some problem when being exported.
I hope you like it!

Hi.
If anyone sees this (AND is interested) I would like you to give me your opinion.
I'm starting with the Gnucci, and I realized that when I import them they always have their mouths open (as if it were their default pose)
I've "taken the trouble" (in quotes because honestly it's not hard) to manipulate your models to make fix that problem.
Should I fix these types of defects?
Personally, I don't like a model to have these kinds of imperfections at the time of publication.
Should I correct it or instead leave it as it is?
(The texts in the image are in Spanish, and mean "Before" and "After" respectively.)

I'm very happy with the result of this one!
This character only appears in one cinematic, and is a corpse, so I had to necessarily edit his face
