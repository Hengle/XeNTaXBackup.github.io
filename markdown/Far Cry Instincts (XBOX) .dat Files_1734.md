- Post Title: Far Cry Instincts (XBOX) *.dat Files

Could you please look at the *.dat archives from Far Cry Instincts (XBOX) - I think they contain something but I am not sure.

Here is a sample I got from it:

There was previous documentation on it but unfornutly/weirdly Game Extractor does not support it:

[http://wiki.xentax.com/index.php/Far_Cry_Instincts_DAT](http://wiki.xentax.com/index.php/Far_Cry_Instincts_DAT)

Thanks in advance for your help. If you complete this I will more then happy to donate to both of you .

Hmm yeah by the look of it the specs are not complete...

1. Maybe I was expecting a field for the number of files, or file offsets or something
2. Maybe the specs were partially right, but when I tried to code something to read them it didn't work.

Either way, it isn't ready to code up yet. Thus the reason why it is on the wiki - so someone else might find it and fix it up.
