- Post Title: No More Heroes-Sound Files

First off: I don't have any Wii,thus I don't have the game. I just happened to find a full gameplay at youtube and fell in love with the beam katana and it'S sounds 8-D

Anyway, I found on FF-shrine a full Music rip from No more heroes.Clean and long,how I love it.


So I wonder if there're any sound rips or attemps to rip it?

I want the beam katana sounds ;~; !
