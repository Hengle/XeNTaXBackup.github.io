Downloading at the moment, hold on tight 

Lots of Atrac3 audio, VAG Audio, TIM2 GFX files, and misc files with headers i havent seen before.
one interesting thing here is though that i think this archive contains CAB files, which im about to rip out.
maybe the CAB files holds something of interest.

Edit 2:
The CAB files seems to be containing GIM Image files and TIM2 files.

and this is a really nested way of doing an archive. they even have CAB files within the CAB files,
so some files are compressed up to 3 times. I dont really know why, but hey, it made me giggle.

Edit 3: There is a vast amount of GIM images in here, and they are all openable with Pangya GIM Viewer.
when i say openable, i mean.... openable, most of them looks scrambled. i dont know why yet. either my ripper sucks
or its a GIM variation of the format.

Ah, thank you.  Would you mind upload the extracted files?

Also, did you just use WInRAR to extract it? Because, all I get is one file...

after exctracting the rar/7z file you will get a topx.dat file, which i then scanned a bit with 
my own ripper Jaeder Naub, this will output more files from the archive, however at the moment im not sure
which files are legit and working, and which ones are not. so you can try to use Jaeder naub on the topx.dat for the moment
until i get it working as intended.

link for jaeder naub is [http://jaedernaub.com/](http://jaedernaub.com/)
download version 2.2.3Z , its been tested and works to extract most of the data from this archive (GIM, TIM2, CAB, WAVE Atrac3).

but as stated, i currently dont know how well the GIM and TIM2 images work, its under investigation.

I don't even get a topx.dat, I just a WAY smaller all.dat file, which is about 1.5 mb big.
Edit: Ah, okay, the Jub thing worked, the Cab files are corrupted.

I get no corruption on any CAB file from that rip, they all work, so im not entirely sure what goes wrong with your rip.

Thanks so much! I found what I wanted. The E***.dat files which contains the sprites.

One more thing,  is it possible the e***.dat  file has gims in the? Also, the face.dat appears to have some GIMs as well.

This is a very high probability. when i analyzed the unpacked dat files (the ones from the CABs), they contained lots of different data, and i think some of them contained GIM images aswell,
and some dat's even contained more CABs. which then in turn could possibly contain more GIM or even TIM2 images. i havent had the chance to analyze them fully, since there was a hell lot of them.

Ah. I looked at one the e**.dat file and had BIN files.
Oh, one more thing, you mind taking a look at few more files?

If you want to extract the e*.dat files (or any file with FPS4 as its header, such as the .EFF files inside some of the e*.dat files), you can use this tool to do so. Just drag&drop any number of files, and it will unpack it into a folder with the same name as the input file (minus extension, or with _dump appended if the input file has no extension).

Some FPS4 files do not contain the data they describe. Drag&drop that file with its accompanying data file to unpack them as well (this is only checked if exactly two files are provided, otherwise it is assumed the data is in the same file). None of the files in the e*.dat files should have this though, although several in topx.dat do.

I have to say that I had no problems when dragging one or multiple files into the .exe. It also extracts the proper amount of files here. Are you sure the folder you are working in has enough write permissions? (I suppose so, as one file did appear)
Does the program give any error messages when you use the command line?
(also, you can download an updated version (same link); it has a bugfix for the paired-file mode)


Also, about the .DS3 files;
The start of the file contains some pointers to the various sections in the file, as well as their lengths. Individual sections can be compressed with any of the built-in compression formats of the NDS (although I've only seen LZ-compressed parts), and each separate cell inside the graphics section can be as well. The most effective way to extract the graphics from these files is probably to figure out the format of the sections beside the palette and graphics (I have to admit I haven't really tried to do so).

in some of the files im seeing 8 bit bitmaps without any compression whatsoever.
and in some files im not really sure, its certainly not graphics or sound in all this files. cannot say that i see anything that resembles any kind
of compression so far. but then again, there are many many files.
