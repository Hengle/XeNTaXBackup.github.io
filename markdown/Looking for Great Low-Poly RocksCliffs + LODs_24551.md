- Post Title: Looking for Great Low-Poly Rocks/Cliffs + LODs

Hey, 

I'm been occasionally digging around here and there, but does anyone know what's the best games that have rocks and cliffs under these criteria?

- Lowish-poly 
- Not too stylized/cartoony (World of Warcraft)
- Preferably have LODs
- Primarily reliant on diffuse map for shading and shadowing/ambient occlusion- no separately mapped Ambient Occlusion map*
- Easily extractable, for use for modding in an old game engine

My gut feeling is that there must be some late-2000s-mid-2010s open-world game with something like this...

* By this I mean that the shading is mostly on the diffuse layer, so that even without any engine lighting or shadows, the model looks detailed.
Example from Anno 1800:

Just for future reference, we do not exist as a site to facilitate people stealing assets for their own projects. The correct path here would be to investigate free model sites, or, if you have the money to spare, finding some paid assets to license, or even commission a modeler to create the assets you need. With that said, I'm locking this topic.
