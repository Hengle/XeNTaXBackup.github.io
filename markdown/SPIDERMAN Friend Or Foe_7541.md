- Post Title: SPIDERMAN: Friend Or Foe

Look, I know this game is old, but i don't know an extractor for it. Does anyone have a bms script or something?
I would guess the models/textures are either in .data or .dict files. 
Sample here: [http://www.mediafire.com/?mbk276h0222ru7e](http://www.mediafire.com/?mbk276h0222ru7e)
The main characters seem to be in the directory "SpiderMan - Friend Or Foe\art\characters".

Perhaps this will help a little. [http://tinyurl.com/SM-F0F](http://tinyurl.com/SM-F0F) ( pack of spidey FOF characters )
Or you can go here [http://thefree3dmodels.com/stuff](http://thefree3dmodels.com/stuff) DL the models individually ( these ones also have the normal maps and are in correct T pose )
By yours truly.
