Hi Skrillex,

I see that you've created this post in 3 separate forums. While your celebrity status may grant you some leeway on other forums, I am not personally a fan of your work, and ask that you observe common courtesy for your fellow forum users by demonstrating patience and consideration that your needs may not outweigh the needs of others.

Thank you, and good luck with your career.
