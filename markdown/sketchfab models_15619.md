Looks like there is no sketchfab extract tools at the moment.
- ninja ripper doesn't work at the end, models gets all messed up, with holes in it and wrong uvs.

I'm looking or one solution, even paying for it.

There currently is no other way that gets the models without holes, you just have to do a bit of cleanup. Plus, stop making new threads
