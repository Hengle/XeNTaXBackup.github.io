- Post Title: Dark Souls 2 Map Files Extraction Problem

Hi all, if anyone can help me it would be very much appreciated!

I have been able to dump Dark Souls 2's .BHD and .BDT files using BinderTool and I've been able to access almost all models using a MaxScript for opening .flv files except for the Maps and Areas.

When I put their files in BinderTool the extraction outcome is an empty folder with nothing in it. Does anyone know any solution for this or another extractor that might work?

Here is a sample file for one of the maps: [https://drive.google.com/file/d/0ByoZQW ... sp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0ByoZQWl-HzbMOWhsM2FfWF9HNWc/view?usp=sharing) (You have to have both files in the same folder).

Can't serve with that. Also there are not too many coders who care for maps.
(It's not a pure map file, is it? Found bone names in it, for example.)

Anyway I took a look using hex2obj (view link in my sig):
