- Post Title: Space Channel 5 Part 2 Animation/Model Files, Help Needed

Going off of what has been said in these threads: 
[https://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=14805](https://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=14805)
[viewtopic.php?f=16&t=16513](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=16513)
The file formats of the first and second game are almost identical and so they should behave in a similar manner, which they might do, unfortunately the discussion ended more than a year ago, with the only good thing coming from them being the Noesis support for SC5s original animation/model format(which was already going to happen)
I'm kind of sure that the RBPs function remains the same, skeletal data containing animation can be loaded onto another RBP or CDR file containing hundreds of submeshes(the character models of the game) while the individual model/skeleton combos are also stored in cdball.afs where they're contained as cd1 files that can be edited into pvm texture archives and nj model files with hex edit.

Currently, i'm completely lost, the rbp files can't load into noesis and Part 2's animations remain locked away as I have no python experience and would make a custom import plugin if I could, so I seek the help of these forums.

Noesis uses internal code for that format, afair:

btw: since you seem to have taken your 7z upload from that thread it would have made sense to link to it, why not?

I linked to both of the threads at the top of my post, unless there's a third thread I don't know about
I also have the steam version of part 2 and the dreamcast version of part 1 so using those already uploaded files was just a matter of convenience, I can upload any file from them if needed

In R10.rb there are 136 NJCM, whatever it may stand for.
In title0.rbp there's 11 of them.

One idea would be to understand the structure of R10.rb, then try to transform the contents of title0.rbp following that structure.

But understanding R10.RB will be a tedious task (floats should represent position and quaternion rotation, something like that):
