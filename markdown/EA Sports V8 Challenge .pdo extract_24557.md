In MS-Windows explorer right click the pdo file then choose "Send to", "Compressed folder".

If you're the same person who posted the .pdo file in the Xentax Discord - I've had a look at it and it seems to use some unknown compression method.  The QuickBMS compression scanner didn't seem to give anything useful.

So it might be a case of someone reverse engineering the compression method from the executable and writing a tool to decompress the data.
