More attentive view revealed next:

ToWAV can decode 7 of 26 .fsb music files:
credits_music.fsb (standart MP3)
el_victory_01.fsb (IMA ADPCM-coded WAV)
endthemelayer2.fsb (standart MP3)
or_victory_01a.fsb (IMA ADPCM-coded WAV)
sm_victory.fsb (standart MP3)
stinger_defeat_01a_05sec.fsb (standart MP3)
ty_victory_01a.fsb (IMA ADPCM-coded WAV)

Other 19 files is multichannel WAVs and dont decodable in any programs(ToWav, fsbext), except fsb_mpeg.

fsbext just unpack raw data, which cant be played with and without -a key in any programs right(winamp with vgmstream, Sony Sound Forge 10).
