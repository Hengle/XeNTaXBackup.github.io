- Post Title: Marvel vs Capcom 3 character select graphics injection

If I extracted a character select portrait from a character's .arc file and then edited the texture file, 
would I be able to repackage the .arc file with the new texture file in there and it would work fine? or would the game crash upon loading the character select?
