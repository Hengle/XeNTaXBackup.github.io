- Post Title: Lemmings 3 (The All New World Of Lemmings)

The frontend files were siple to open, but as a complete newbie in this field, i can't extract the game graphics themselves. The graphics folder has a bunch of files with the endings .DEL .DIN .RAW .FGF .CMP .IND .PAL .RAW and .AUX

I have posted the folder (and also the "styles" folder) with the contents at [http://www.lordt.net/adversa/l3gfx.zip](http://www.lordt.net/adversa/l3gfx.zip)

In case you need some exe files for better ripping, the game is also available at the Home Of The Underdogs ad abandonware.

Thanks for help in advance!

I do know PAL is palette and RAW might refer to the raw image. I'm soon reaching my finals so I might give a further analysis but that is about all I can do. Not a programmer yet.
