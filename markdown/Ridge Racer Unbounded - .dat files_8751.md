Hello, I'm trying to translate this game, and even managed, but in hexadecimal, which complicates and slows the process a lot.

Extract this file using the tool XpoZed,
[viewtopic.php?f=10&t=8629&start=15](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=8629&start=15)

If anyone can help me, a file is attached. He has only the text within it, and I believe it is not difficult to understand the subject (which is not my case, hehehehe).

Another thing, how do I translate the game, not only serves an unpacker need a repack too. dat <-> txt.

Someone will easily create a tool.

```
uint32{4} - ID Length
uint32{4} - String Length (ANSI) - for UNICODE *2
...
```

Is that means you could made WORKING localization for this game?
If yes, how could you made it?

[I have already the tools, but the game doesn't reading the unpacked and translated sources from "data" folder]

You need put all the extracted files in data folder, not just localization files. And rename or delete the original file.

I've tried last night - i got black screen, the game was frozen.

For the record:
* I've extracted "02____update_____" (from v1.08 Update)
* In "data\localization" folder I made some changes in "language0.dat"
* All files from extracted source copied in the game - Data\
* Made "02____update_____" backup and deleted it.
* Game started = black screen, frozen

What did i wrong?
