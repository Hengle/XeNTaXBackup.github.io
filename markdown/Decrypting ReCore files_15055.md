- Post Title: Decrypting ReCore files

First of all, not sure if this is the proper subforum for this question and that I didn't break any rules, if not I hope one of the moderators will move it to the proper subforum. (thanks in advance)

So here's the deal the game is an .eappx format windows 10 app and after installation the files are all encrypted and taking ownership of them does nothing and you basically can't do anything with the files. My question now is if someone has any ideas how to decrypt said files so we can rip some stuff from the game and dig around in the game files ? 

The only thing I know is that someone managed to do it with Halo 5 Forge for win10 that had the same .eappx format , and he did it by making a .dll that dumped the files outside of the protected folder and by using cheat engine and extracted tags as reference. 

So any help in figuring this out would be appreciated! Thanks!
