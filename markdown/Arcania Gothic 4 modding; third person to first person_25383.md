- Post Title: Arcania Gothic 4 modding; third person to first person

Hello. I have a favourite computer game named Arcania Gothic 4. I am used to turn around the character by mouse, known as 'first person';
The problem is that the respective function exists only when using a bow, when aiming; besides that, moving the mouse sideways rotates the camera around the character and it doesn't turn the character around; this function is very inappropriate in general, especially when using melee weapons or when using a shield; it is very difficult or impossible to orient the character towards the opponent I'm fighting; Do you know what source code I have to add into a editable game file so that the game is 'first person' (the character is turned around by mouse) in general, not only when using a bow;

As mentioned the respective function already exists in the game, but only for using a bow; Unfortunately there aren't modding tools for the game to view the files that contain the respective source code but there are some modding tools that allow to edit some game files that contain game controls;

I appreciate.
