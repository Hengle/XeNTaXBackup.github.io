- Post Title: Dutch Election "You play with us, we play with you" projects

[We had the idea to create some modifications of existing games](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=9579&start=15), introducing some of the Dutch parties leaders of consequence to games. On the 12th of September there will be the elections. As they play with our laws and welfare, debating senselessly using one-liner after one-liner to play the public, why don't we build ourselves some lookalikes. And play with those instead?

Here's a thread for some of the results so far, in order of release!  


1. Fall Out: New Vegas (dragbody)
2. Counterstrike 1.6 (onelove1210)
3. Counterstrike: Source (Trishty)
4. Grand Theft Auto IV (huckleberrypie)

Version specifics: 
You can simply unpack the file in the cstrike/models/player folder and overwrite the existing ones. If you want to keep the originals then back those up first. You now have 6 new faces on the players. 
At the terrorist side you will find faces that look like but of course are not the real Mr. Buma, Mr. Rutte and Mr. Wilders. 
At the counter-terrorist side you will find faces that look like but of course are not the real Mr. Samsom, Mr. Roemer and Mr. Pechtold. Look at it as the election: the collapsed virtual government join the terrorist side, refusing to accept their failure, hunted down by the new possible government. Luckily they stand up each round to try again. No actual people get killed.

Game: Grand Theft Auto IV
Mods: Mr. Wilders lookalike is introduced
Version: 0.1
Authors: [huckleberrypie](http://forum.xentax.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&u=25340), [Mr.Mouse](http://forum.xentax.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&u=3)
Version specifics: 
The "Eddie Low" model is changed to a Mr. Wilders lookalike.  
Installation: 

```
1. OpenIV ( http://openiv.com/ )
2. Simple Native Trainer ( http://www.gtaforums.com/index.php?showtopic=392973 )
3. Either one of these:
Asi Loader ( http://www.gtaforums.com/index.php?showtopic=380830 ), or
Xliveless ( http://www.gtaforums.com/index.php?showtopic=388658 ), or
Yaasil ( http://www.gtaforums.com/index.php?showtopic=394806 )

1. Unpack the ig_eddielow.wdd and ig_eddielow.wtd to a location of your choice
2. Start OpenIV and target your GTAIV folder (where the .exe is)
3. Go to the folder Models->cdimages and open (doubleclick) componentspeds.img
4. Make sure readonly mode is not on (flip through the dialogs to turn that off, and Edit mode on)
5. Find ig_eddielow.wdd in the list you see in OpenIV and right click it, then select Replace. 
Target the file with the same name you just unpacked and click "Open".  
6. Do the same for the file ig_eddielow.wtd. 
7. Go to File and select Rebuild, and let OpenIV rebuild the archive. It will make the changes. 
8. Close OpenIV
9. Install the files from the Simple Native Trainer in the GTA4 folder. Read the instructions carefully in the readme of the trainer. 
10. Install either Asi Loader, XLiveless or Yaasil as necessary. 
11. Start the game with LaunchGTAIV.exe (give both this program AND GTAIV.exe Admin rights in Win7). 
12. In game, you can select F3/F4 to show a menu. Read the instruction of Simple Native Trainer what you can do. 
You can select the Eddie Low model and spawn it any time, or spawn it as boddy guard, or even change your own player to that model. 
You should notice the model looks a lot like Mr. Wilders.
