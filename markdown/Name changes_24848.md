You can now change your account name yourself! To do so, click your name in the top-right corner, then click "User Control Panel" in the popup window, then the "Profile" tab, and finally the "Edit account settings" option. If you need help, please post here, but note that if a username change is prevented because it matches the blacklist, we probably won't allow you to use that username.

Hello, I am unable to change my username (I just want to change the first letter uppercase)

On your sample image your name is in an input field, by mine is not.
Could you please check, or it is enough for me if you could change the first letter uppercase.

Thank you!

PS: I logged out and back in, maybe it helps, but nothing changed.

Aah, sorry about that. Turns out there was one other setting that needed changed, which I've updated. Renaming should now work for all accounts, if you could please try again.
