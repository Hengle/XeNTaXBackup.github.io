Hi mate,

Thanks for the heads up  . The plugin I have for Black Arrow works for the archive I have, however I only have the 1 archive so obviously I made a mistake somewhere in my assumptions. I will try to fix this for the next update.

Hi again,

Just an update - I have looked at your *.ss2 file you sent from Black Arrow, and this doesn't look like an archive at all. Maybe the *.ss2 extension is used for a variety of different purposes, or I had an archive from a demo, or something like that because the one I have here at home works fine and looks totally different to the one you sent.

Sorry, I can't do anything to read the one you attached - it is not an archive that I can tell at all, and certainly doesn't have anything useful/usable in it.

ive tried reading as 16 bit and 8 bit sound as PCM and this is for sure the mainmusic from the game,
but it is compressed with something I havent figured out yet, so the sound
is very distorted. it could be some kind of ADPCM.

the first thing that came in mind was SS2 = Sonic Stage 2 which has sony codecs in it, like Atrac3 and shit. but then...why would Xbox games contain
sony codecs?, anyone know anything about this?
