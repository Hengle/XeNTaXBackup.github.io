Has anyone been able to extract 3d meshes from the RIFT assets files?

The main problem is related to unpack the game, as I know there are tools working for previous version and could only unpack models ( no animation); it's such a pity since we have all the required script to import models and ani in 3d software ( since it uses gamebryio engine). I suggest you to find on google, times ago I found a reddit post in which a user explain how to get at least models.

Hello! yeah I found that too, but the riftniftextractor doesn't load the latest assest.manifest version, the riftniftextractor need to be updated, if you find their github or something, would be cool!
