- Post Title: NiGHTS Into Dreams (PC) Gallery Image Files

G'day!

I'm looking at doing an art extraction on NiGHTS into Dreams for a blog I run (See here: [http://thevideogameartarchive.tumblr.com/](http://thevideogameartarchive.tumblr.com/)). More recently, the XBLA and PC versions of the games had galleries in them which had some nice, clear art in them.

I can screen cap them out, but some of the art is probably at an even better resolution than whatever it's pushing out from inside the game. As far as I can tell, the art is within BIN files in the directories named "GAMEUI_GALLERY_###".

Being a big idiot about this stuff, I'd have no idea what compression they'd be using or format they are in. 

I've uploaded the specific BIN files here:

The game went from a PS2 release to XBLA to PC, so it might be something weird. If you can point me in the right direction of how to get to the assets, that'd be pretty awesome
