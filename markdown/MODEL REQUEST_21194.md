Avoid ALL CAPS as it makes other people edgy, second since it seems your new, do the following.
If you own the game, which I strongly recommend, go to this address: [http://frostytoolsuite.com/](http://frostytoolsuite.com/)
The game is based on the Frostbite engine so those set of tool are mandatory.
Download the Suite, import the game, navigate to what ever model is your looking for then export it to your FBX format if you desire skeletal/weight data or just static OBJ/MTL and your all set, neat right ? 
And obviously if you get stuck use their Discord server for future help, you'll be surprised how easy is to do it yourself.

have fun
