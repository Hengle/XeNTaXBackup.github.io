- Post Title: [x360] forza 3 .zip files

hello everyone, hope this is the right section otherwise move the topic please, thanks 

so me and a friend were browsing through the forza3 disc lookin for vehicle files. turns out forza uses some .carbin file extension for their meshes, those are stored in a .zip file, along with .xds files (probably xbox .dds type?), some .xml and .tga files. the problem so far is we are not able to unpack these .zip files, tried several programs from winrar to 7z to totalcommander nothing works, always get a error "compression method not supported". 

so we thought maybe you guys have an idea 

heres an example: [http://files.uploadffs.com/a/1/28f615c7/AST_DB9_05.zip](http://files.uploadffs.com/a/1/28f615c7/AST_DB9_05.zip)

thanks for any help in advance  greetings

you must use [QuickBMS](http://aluigi.org/papers.htm#quickbms) and the [zip.bms script](http://aluigi.org/papers/bms/zip.bms).
