- Post Title: [pc] Medal Of Honor (2010)

EA Layaer 3 Extractor doesn't work properly with xxx files of Medal Of Honor 2010(PC). it seems these files contain more than one stream and EA Layaer 3 Extractor only extract first stream.
I used -s option to extract all streams. but it didn't work.

Here are two sample files of Medal Of Honor 2010 (PC): [link](http://www.box.net/shared/p2l03ukofp) ( one of these files is just a little directory archive. )
Can ealayer3.exe extract/decode these files? HOW?
Thanks for helping!
