- Post Title: Lost Key - Please can an admin help me out?

basically i donated and recieved my key a couple of months ago and started working on a project, unfortunatly, my computer kinda died and i had no choice but to run a system restore back to how the computer was when i purchased it. i thought i had my mexcom key saved online in my aol account, so it wouldnt be a problem to reinstall.. unfortunatly this isnt the case, and i no longer have access to the features i need.

so can an admin send me a new key please?
