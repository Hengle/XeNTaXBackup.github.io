- Post Title: Imperium Romanum - How to access HPK files

I'm trying to translate this game but I'm a beginner and I have no idea how to open the file that is in HPK format, I've translated a game but not 100% I used Notepad++ as a tool, but this game uses a different graphics engine. could anyone give me a tip ?
