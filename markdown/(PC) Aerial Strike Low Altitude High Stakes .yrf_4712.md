This is the structure of the .YRF file:

```
   -> ID : Array[0..4] Of Char; // 'YRSFW'
   -> Unknown1 : Array[0..7] Of Byte;
   -> DirectoryStartPos : DWORD // Points to the end of the file
   -> Unknown2 : Array[0..3] Of Byte // or [0..4] of Byte

 ->File data...

 ->Directory: (recursive)
   -> Flag       : WORD // 0=directory 1=file
   -> NameLength : WORD 
   -> Name : Array[0..NameLength-1] of Chars

     -> if Flag==0 (directory)
         -> NrOfChildItems : DWORD
                 // for each entries in this directory
                 // Repeat from "Flag" 

     -> if Flag==1 (file)
         -> FileSize     : DWORD
         -> FileStartPos : DWORD


```

I created a simple YRF extractor/updater util. It's possible to extract all files form the .YRF archive, or replace only one file inside the .YRF. The "Make .YRF" function not works yet, but I'm working on it.

I finished my YRF util, now it can extract, update or create new .YRF files.

I was just searching all over the web for a YRF packer/unpacker util. Is it still available for download? I'd like to extract Yager's .yrf files for localization.

Any chance you still happen to have the source code for this program? I would like to try adding support for the Xbox version of Yager. Seems your tool is not compatible with the YRF archives from it.
