Hi mate,

Um I don't really know what the structure is by looking at that code above - I  don't read hex all that much - but if you could post some pieces of the archive then I would be happy to look at it for you.

You can get a file cutter program at [http://www.watto.org/extract/download/cutter.zip](http://www.watto.org/extract/download/cutter.zip) if you don't have one already - use that program on the archive and send us the zip that the program creates

Thanks mate.
