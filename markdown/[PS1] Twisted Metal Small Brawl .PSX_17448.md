- Post Title: [PS1] Twisted Metal: Small Brawl .PSX

Hey ALL! huge Twisted Metal Fan, and this request might be a little HARD, since it's from a PS1 game  BUT i'm mainly interested in the car models of this game,
mostly all of ' em have a file format called .PSX, i've also scanned for TIM'S, TMD'S, even PMD'S but alas; NADA, pretty sure the models themselves MIGHT be compressed, but i'm not certain D:

If you can give it a shot, that'd be AWESOME!

Twisted Metal: Small Brawl tool.

Can get models and their textures. Cars usually have only 3 huge high-detail parts scaled originally, and all other parts are EXACTLY 32x times smaller. You have to scale them to fit. Textures will be exported as 16 parts 256x256 each. 

There's also separate tool version that outputs textures as one 4096x256 image. Another separate tool version makes debug output to console which contains all of internal code that can be used to know exact part positions (for example like wheels).





Also levels with all their textures (not fully supported)
