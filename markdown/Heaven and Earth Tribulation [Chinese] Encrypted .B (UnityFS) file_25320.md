- Post Title: Heaven and Earth Tribulation [Chinese] Encrypted .B (UnityFS) file

This game uses UnityFS which can be easily open with AssetsStuido if it weren't encrypted. Every data of the game is encrypted: characters, monsters, scenery and even arts.
The game data UnityFS doesn't have a second UnityFS.
Only the old version of NinjaRipper works with the game but it extract not in T-Pose.

As different with last post I gonna give a Mega with more data of the game with some dll because I read that sometimes the decryption code is there.

Actually they're mostly models because the game is easy to access, is just encrypted. So if any dear moderator can move this post to the 3D topic because I believe it is better there as the data is mostly of models, just encrypted.

A bump? Because I did it last time around October and hadn't show the ability to do it anymore.

I forget that I still have the game data on a hard disk, still waiting if anyone can help me on how decrypt the game data for let at least assetsstudio to load it. Specially because I no longer play the game since November and the space it is using on my Disk is starting to be a death weight.
I'm still interesting on getting the models or sprites of the game because some of the models or sprite will no longer show up in-game for be a "one time only events" for what I remember.

@Darkhowlings: I suppose it's the same game as mentioned in this post: [viewtopic.php?p=189289#p189289](https://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?p=189289#p189289)

I never notice of that one before.
But I don't exactly get how that works. Only a few words and I got completely lost. As for Key I don't have a single idea how to get them or were to look for it on the game data.

@Darkhowlings: You only need to download any of two provided solutions and choose specific game in options, keys for this and some other games are already pre-defined there. Also Razmoth's one allows to define other games/keys manually in options.
