- Post Title: Trying to find video files?

First of all, HI! I'm new! Secondly, in my search for specific tools or scripts, or 'how to', i've always been redirected here. So I decided to make myself known.  I hope I'm posting this question in the right place.

I'm wondering if it's possible if anyone can help me locate the video files for Final Fantasy XIII-2. 
The only script I've found to export anything from the game has been the quickbms script for model files.

So simply put, can anyone give me a quickbms script to get the video files from this game? I'm assuming they're in the same or similar format as the first game (XIII). Pamf? Or Pmf? I can't remember the specific name of the file type exactly.

I'm looking for the files from the XBOX 360 version. If possible. 

Thank you.
