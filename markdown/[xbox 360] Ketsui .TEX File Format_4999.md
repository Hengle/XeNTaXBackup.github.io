- Post Title: [xbox 360] Ketsui .TEX File Format

I am trying to rip some sprites from this game, it looks like all graphics are stored in files with extension.TEX

It seems like some kind of raw uncompressed format. I can see the graphics  but I can't seem to find the colours!

Here is an example treating the data as ARGB (1555):

It looks as if the image is 16bit big-endian.

I have attached the original file and wordswapped file.

Please can someone tell me where the colours are hiding!
