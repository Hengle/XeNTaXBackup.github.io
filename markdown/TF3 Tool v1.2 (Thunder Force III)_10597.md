- Post Title: TF3 Tool v1.2 (Thunder Force III)

This tool allows you compression and decompression of all graphics from the game, named Thunder Force III.
There are two types of graphic resources in the game:
- LZH compressed;
- RLE compressed.

You should to read the "TF3 Hacking Guide" by OO Styx: [http://www.romhacking.net/documents/465/](http://www.romhacking.net/documents/465/) to find offsets of graphics of the game.
One remark: in his guide he uses another names for LZH and RLE. Keep in mind that:
- Iwanaga compression = LZH compression;
- Ohtsuka compression = RLE compression;

Also this tool allows to view all planets maps, and title screen of the game. In the future, you will be able to edit it all!
