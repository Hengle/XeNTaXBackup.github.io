- Post Title: Shin路Janryumon .node file

hello , I extracted the Shin路Janryumon .rom file, and I get some file .node looks like a model file.

these files has a "GEODEBIN" file header. but I cant find any resources to open that.

Hoping someone will know how to open/extract/convert the .node to another usable filetype. Here's some of the files.
