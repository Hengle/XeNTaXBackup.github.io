You may bump as much as you want...  

One problem seems to be that the bone names are hashed:

  0 "Bone 99dc9c9c"  -1
  1 "Bone 3e91886e"  0
  2 "Bone d0c5e164"  1
  3 "Bone d8a80b17"  2
  4 "Bone b558fee4"  3
  5 "Bone f9a068c5"  4
  6 "Bone 8e379e18"  5
  7 "Bone 9d5bed7"  6
  8 "Bone 795fe0d3"  7
  9 "Bone 8350ddb0"  7
  10 "Bone f5814ed6"  7
...

So it's no fun to care for animations. (And about 120 bones make things even worse.)

I've found this:
[https://github.com/DeniZka/cat2blend](https://github.com/DeniZka/cat2blend)

This appears to be a blender importer for model and animations files in Senran Kagura Estival Versus and that is the only game that the creator tested with, so I don't know if this would work with the files from Gintama Rumble.
