- Post Title: Trying to unpack PMODE executable from scratch

Hello,
I'm currently trying to understand how [PMODE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PMODE) works to unpack executables and therefore reverse engineer them more easily.

I want to make it clear that I don't want to rely on third party tools that would unpack the executable for me, but rather understand everything myself and write my own python script to do the job.

[PMODE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PMODE) is used for old dos games such as Rayman.
If you have some tips or suggested readings, please let me know.
