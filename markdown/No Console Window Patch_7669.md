- Post Title: No Console Window Patch

Hi guys,


I was wondering if someone here knows how to modify an executable to not open a console/command prompt window. An executable already made. I know you can compile it not to have a console window of course but say for the ones that didn't.

As my understanding goes you are supposed to change the header of the file. I am however not sure how or exactly what to do.

Can anyone help?


Thanks.
