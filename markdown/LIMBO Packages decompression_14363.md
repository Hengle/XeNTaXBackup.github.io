Hi
I finally successfully decompressed the limbo file packages but the extracted files doesn't have special format and I cant see them in any special application.

tnx

Use a hex editor.
It looks like binary/compiled form of some text script file.

You can use some portable hex editor. Actually it doesn't matter if you install it or not.
And it is "binary". It's not plain text, and it contains also non-printable characters. 

So what you can do? I don't know.

take a look at it.

limbo_runtime.pkg does not contain any texture data. Try unpack limbo_boot.pkg
