- Post Title: [PC] Hitman: Absolution

Hello.
I want to translate the Hitman: Absolution. But I don't know where is text files and font files.
In my opinion, text files seem to be here: Hitman Absolution\runtime\common\globalresources.ini or pc.layoutconfig
And does anybody know how to unpack and repack PC_RESOURCELIB files and PC_HEADERLIB files or text files and font files? I need your help.
Thank you.

You can use this from a Vietnammese forum:
[http://adf.ly/T2boY](http://adf.ly/T2boY), unpack password: bdtd91
text file is ali213.d12, edit by notepad, rewrite your language in the line between "xfhsm_res_CHI_Start" and "xfhsm_res_CHI_End"
remember to copy and replace binkw32.dll

Well, your link is Adfly link. 
That Vietnamese localization patch is seem based on Chinese "hook" a archive type localization patch. Hook a archive type is not perfectly.
