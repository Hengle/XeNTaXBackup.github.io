Hi
Here is an importer for meshes, skeleton and converter for images.
It requires Blender 249b and Python 2.6.6.
How use:
1.run Blender249.blend 
In Blender Text Window press alt+p and select:
- dat files with size more than 1mb . It converts to dds.
For autotexturing, after converting check if it is diffuse map rename to 0.dds, if normal map rename to 1.dds
- dat files with size circle 300 kb - meshes with weighting
- dat files with size 4 kb - skeleton
