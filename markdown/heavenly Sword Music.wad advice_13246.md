Hi, I'm new to this whole thing and I was wondering if I could get some advice on stuff.

I'v been working with an old PS3 game called Heavenly Sword. and one of the things im trying to do is make a soundtrack.

I've managed to extract the music.wad file using quickbms but I'm at a loss as to what to do next.
the files are cut into pieces and have no recognisable naming convention, so' I'm at a loss as to how to proceed with putting the songs back together. 
If I could just figure out some way of sorting the file segments, or finding whatever the game uses to tell what to play, when,. then i could  piece them all together and loop them.
problem is I'm not sure what to look for or where to look

any advice you guys could give me would be greatly appreciated

Sadly there isn't as there are no filenames. I've looked into it previously myself.

The only way to know which segments go together is to play the game with no SFX or voices and listen/record as you go.

there must be some way.
The game's code must have instructions for what to play when, or there would be no music
Surely some xml or dat somewhere must have the info
