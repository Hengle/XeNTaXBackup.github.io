- Post Title: How do I unlock sgc files from Richard Burns Rally?

I can import stock car models into Zmodeler 2, but when I try to import mods it says
This file is locked and can not be imported
How do I unlock it?
I am NOT trying to steal someone's hard work model. I'm just wondering how to unlock it.

sample: PLEASE DO NOT USE THIS SAMPLE FOR STEALING.
