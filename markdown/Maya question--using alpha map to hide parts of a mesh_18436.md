- Post Title: Maya question--using alpha map to hide parts of a mesh

I'm working with a model that has more than one outfit mesh attached to it.  I decided to use alpha maps to hide the parts of the mesh I didn't want to export.  I have the alpha set to the transparency node in a Phong material.  Things looked right in the viewport, but when I exported to FBX, it looked like the alpha hadn't actually applied.  Any thoughts?  Thanks! (I'll try and pull a few screenshots to elaborate).
