Hi, I want to extract models from the game Barbie and Her Sisters: Puppy Rescue. I found files in the game folder .hnk that contain models, using .bms script I unpacked these archives, but these archives contain files .dat which are likely to contain the model. I don't know how to unpack these files, so I'm asking for your help guys. Thanks.
