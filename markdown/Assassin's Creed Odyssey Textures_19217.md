- Post Title: Assassin's Creed Odyssey Textures

I've manually extracted Kassandra's head diffuse texture and added a DDS header but the colors are off. I was thinking it might be in ARGB but swapping the channels doesn't produce anything correct looking unless I just haven't gotten the right combination yet. I'm hoping this isn't actually a mask for a skin material and is the actual color values. Any ideas?

This is 2048x2048 with DXGI_FORMAT_BC7_UNORM.

How did you extract it from the forge file ? Did you use a tool or something ?

I used quickbms to extract the forge file.
