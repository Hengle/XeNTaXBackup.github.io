- Post Title: Regarding the usage of MaxScripts for 3D model import/export

I have two questions regarding the usage of MaxScripts in regards to 3D model importing/exporting/conversion:

1. Why is 3DS Max the go-to tool for creating import/export/conversion plugins? Why is it that the open-source 3D application Blender, or even other proprietary 3D applications such as Maya/C4D/Modo/etc., are so rarely used?

2. Why do most, if not all, of the import/export plugins make use of the same copy-pasted code? Functions like `ReadBEHalfFloat`, `floatSwap2`, and others seem to be the exact same across many plugins. Is there some sort of application that auto-generates these, or are they from somewhere?
