I used Game Assassin to extract some characters but he extracts only half of model in T pose and rest is posed.
I did Ezio but I would like some proper extractor for other models. It's very hard to modify posed parts to fit T posed ones.
ForgeX was great for II and Brotherhood! It would be nice to update it to work with Revelations

And Yuredacy2311 due to the new rules (refer to No. 2), you should remove the links to your sample data as they are no longer permitted.

Thanks  Does it work in Windows 7?

It will work with Windows 7, however if you are using the 64-bit version you may have issues viewing the texture/image files.  Also, due to multiple registry configurations you may need to right-click in the treeview window and select 'Add Game' and then browse to your installation directory.

I have Win7 32bit but I don't know how to work with ForgeX. It used to be program but now only two .dll files. How to use it?
Thanks in advance

Click the "ForgeX Beta 2" title from the download page to download the self-extracting rar file.

The .dll files are required files that you may (if you have downloaded ForgeX in the past) or may not already have.

I downloaded ForgeX Beta 2 and placed .dll files in system32 but when I start program it said "ForgeX Beta has stopped working"
Is it because I currently have no Assassins Creed or any other games that are extractable by this program?
Thank you for your help

Can you screenshot the error window for me.

Regardless the program should not have stopped working, however it is pretty useless unless you have one of the games installed, or at the very least a forge file located somewhere.

I'll install Assassin's Creed Revelation and I'll also try it on other computer and see if works than
