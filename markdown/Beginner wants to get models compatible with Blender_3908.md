- Post Title: Beginner wants to get models compatible with Blender

So I've been lately trying to get a model format of .MDL to work with Blender 3D, however, I've tried Quake's .MDL importer (Or at least, some kind of .MDL importer) and it didn't work, making me think that this format is different from the real .MDL.

The graphics/sound/resources .WAD file is actually a compressed archive (and I believe most games are like that) for the game, Happy Tree Friends: False Alarm. (You've probably heard of the show it's based off of, trust me, it's NOT a kiddie thing like it sounds)

Anyways, I've never successfully ripped or converted models on my own, and frankly I don't even know if this is even the right board to put this in, but I don't think there's a "Beginner" section on this forum, so feel free to move this where ever.

One doesn't have to rip the models and convert them for me, I just need some help finding the right thing for getting the model out of the game without ripping directly, because 3D Ripper X doesn't work well with this game and that's the only real ripper I know of.

Thanks in advance.

EDIT: My retarded-ness made me forget to upload a sample model. Added attachment.

EDIT2: Uhg, I took ".MDL" out of the file name because it won't allow it to upload.

EDIT3: Okay... I can't even upload a file with NO extension... So like... How do I upload it?!

Zip it up, OR rename the file extension to .zip or something the board accepts.
So long as you write in the post that its just a fake file extension and it should be fine.

.MDL is a pretty common file format, so its normally highly customised and the only thing in common with other .MDL files is usually just the extension.

Ah, I get it now.

So .MDL formats can vary on the way it works? Lovely ;~; Bet that makes it annoying to convert.

I tried uploading via here, but the maximum size is a measly 256 KB, so here's a link to Box.net... Well, I should have done this in the first place...
