There are no tools for that. You can edit by hex editor or download unreal engine devkit, make your own uexp files and figure out file format to edit them.

UEXP files and UASSET files are that's all.
Here's latest version of LOCRES files.

There's no UI strings in your LOCRES file.

Original LOCRES type is "0E 14 74 75 67 ... 7F 1B 01".
So your LOCRES file doesn't work...
