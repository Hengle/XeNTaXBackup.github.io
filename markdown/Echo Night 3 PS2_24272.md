Maximum face index should be around 40 (== vertex count) - I didn't get suiting face indices so far. (So used auto created ones.)

how to fill vertices with faces?What you think is face indices (FIs) looks much too regular to me. So auto created face indices seem to do the trick (until someone finds out how to get the FIs, if any).
