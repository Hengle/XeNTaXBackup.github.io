> hi guys. Noesis has made a useful tool to view the 9dragons .x3d models and the relate .tga file associated.Hi quassa,
"Noesis" is the name of the 3D tool, created by MrAdults, the author of the py script for .x3d models is finale00 aka Tsukihime.

> We want to be able to create our own models and export back to .x3d ."export back"? Are you willing to do a full .x3d format analysis then? Because you will need it and I fear, noone else will do it for you.

You could start a simple approach for simple static meshes (with one submesh only), replacing the vertices and uvs in a simple .x3d model file, maintaining the counts.
This is what I suggest since years for ".obj to whateverformat" projects but most likely people fail even with this rather simple task.

Just my two cents,
cheers
