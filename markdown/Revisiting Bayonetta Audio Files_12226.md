- Post Title: Revisiting Bayonetta Audio Files

Greetings fellow XeNTaXians. 
It's been a long time since I've posted, yet I've been a dedicated lurker to this site.
I seem to have regained interest in Bayonetta, since the second game has already been released on the WiiU.

Back when the first game released on the Xbox 360 and PS3 in 2010, I was interested
in ripping the sound effects from the game.  However, at the time, I was only able to find voice clips
for the game's cutscenes, Rodin's phrases, and some other stuff. 

I have been searching through the .AAX files for other voice data like Bayonetta and Jeanne's combat phrases
and puns, enemy sound effects, weapon sfx, stage clear jingles, etc., and have come up with nothing.
I've even searched other sites like The Sounds Resource, but it looks like they also only have the cutscene sound 
files and the other audio files that were found as .AAX files. 

After all these years, has ANYONE been able to find the rest of the sound files besides the .AAX files in
the SE folder of the game?  If so, then can someone point me in the right direction, so I can finally
conclude this endless journey?  Thank you in advance.
