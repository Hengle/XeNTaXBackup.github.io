- Post Title: extract the sims 4 font

Hi all...  

I have tried to find sims 4 fonts file. I've downloaded tools from this topic:

[viewtopic.php?f=35&t=16089](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=35&t=16089)

But I did not find font files...
------------------------------------------------

This site : [http://simswiki.info/wiki.php?title=Sim ... dFileTypes](http://simswiki.info/wiki.php?title=Sims_4:PackedFileTypes)

mentions that the font file exists in: 0x276CA4B9 / ttf / "ClientFullBuild0.package"

How can I extract the font in "ClientFullBuild0.package" file?

I want to change the font because the font it does not support my language characters.

I hope help.....
