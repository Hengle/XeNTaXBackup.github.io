- Post Title: SoulCalibur II (Gamecube) - .VMG Models

Could someone please consider writing a model convertor for SoulCalibur II's .VMG file formats?
OLKexplorer can extract .UNK files from the Gamecube version of SoulCalibur II's root.OLK archive. Some of these file's real extensions are .VMG, and are supposedly similar in purpose to the Xbox version's .VMX models. .VMX models can already be read and exported through ScModelExplorer.

I would also supply a Playstation 2 file sample (.VMP) if I could, but I only have a Gamecube copy.

Thanks for reading.
