The format is fairly simple.... I was working on a Noesis importer but it seems those other folks have beaten me and have done an excellent job with getting it imported into Max. I suggest you wait for that but the alignment is as simple as:

Just look here [viewtopic.php?f=10&t=11534&start=150](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=11534&start=150)

They are working on it, no point in multiple people working on the same thing. Just port the code when it's done or do whatever when it's released

Any plans on importing them back ingame? Format seems simple enough from what I heard, so I'd be more than glad to shove in new cars and characters in WD.

It's unusally quiet.

From what I've read the one who posted about your importer didn't seem to claim the stuff as theirs. He only referred to your tool in response to a question about ripping XBGs off Watch Dogs.

No, but I found that forum post misleading.

There are no Max scripts that import Watch Dogs XBG models.
Those pics come from my importer, and not some other Max script, which he points a link to somewhere else.

Farcry 3 XBG files are totally different that Watch Dogs XBG files.

Hmmm...maybe next time I will put a watermark on my pics.

Seems so, although to clarify what you said, there aren't any Max/Blender/whatever scripts or plugins for Watch Dogs XBGs yet. Disrupt's similarity to Dunia 2.x might have helped with reverse-engineering, but yeah they seem to be different enough to be considered as a Dunia derivative, let alone CryEngine.

That's 'swell, looking forward to it. Now if only that my PC's up to the task of running this game, I'd be doing Watch Dogs ped mods in a whim.

Hello

my importer  for Blender 249:

Update 2014-10-25:
-nothing new, only replace compiled python files .pyc on normal .py files



support: uv,weighting,bones,autotexturing
autotexturing work when use original location xbg file and needed material.bin file exists

problem:translation and scale uvmapping
how fix: go to line 7 and 8 and change UVTrans and UVScale 


script is not perfect but maybe will be helpfull for you for full reversing format

It could as well be vertex coloring even though it seems rather unlikely it uses it like that.

Since he hasn't posted any information about it, I can't assume he figured out how WatchDog animation works.

Once you get a model rigged, it would be easy to remap the skeleton to your own custom animation.
So, is it really WatchDog animation or something else?  Who knows.   Maybe post some info about the MAB format.
That would shed some light.

I'm currently on vacation I'll post research/info when im back home but yes your right that animation isn't from watch dogs I simply applied it to the skeleton to test the skinning and bone weights. As for the material bin files yeah the shader controls the color and such xbgs have shader indices inside too which reference shader parameters. Have you figured out UV scaling yet? Last I checked I couldn't find anything in the xbg which defined the scale

> I think I found the UV scaling, but I haven't figured out how it works yet.

For some parts, it's turned on.  For other parts, it's turned off, as those same fields contain data 
that would mess up the UVs.  I'm guessing the vertex format flags control it, but I've found some 
cases where that fails too.  

Compare bike_01.xbg and speed_01.xbg.  They have the same format flags (0x07CA, 0x17CA, 0x91CA), 
but speed_01.xbg needs to be scaled, while bike_01.xbg does not.

The interesting bits are right next to the UVs:
Code: Select allVertex Format
=============
WORD position[4];
WORD uvs[2];
WORD uv_offset;
WORD uv_scale;
BYTE bone_weights[4];	// sum to 255
BYTE bone_indices[4];
WORD unk[4];

Dump:
[ 0]: (02EA, 06F4, 6D71, 0001)  (2A34, 1AF3, 8000, 2AAA)  (250,  5,  0,  0) (  6,  9,  0,  0)  (DECF, C762, A3A3, FDA3)
[ 1]: (02E2, 06F0, 6D78, 0001)  (2A34, 15FC, 8000, 2AAA)  (250,  5,  0,  0) (  6,  9,  0,  0)  (CD4F, C728, A3A3, FDA3)
[ 2]: (02E3, 06EE, 6D73, 0001)  (2873, 15FC, 8000, 2AAA)  (229, 26,  0,  0) (  6, 10,  9,  0)  (E09D, C732, A3A3, FDA3)
[ 3]: (02E5, 06FA, 6D6B, 0001)  (27D2, 1B54, 8000, 2AAA)  (229, 26,  0,  0) (  6, 10,  9,  0)  (D7DB, C789, A3A3, FDA3)
[ 4]: (02EF, 06F9, 6D67, 0001)  (2A34, 1FEB, 8000, 2AAA)  (250,  5,  0,  0) (  6,  9,  0,  0)  (DEBB, C7BC, A3A3, FDA3)
[ 5]: (02EB, 0701, 6D60, 0001)  (26FB, 1FEB, 8000, 2AAA)  (229, 26,  0,  0) (  6, 10,  9,  0)  (DBB4, C7C7, A3A3, FDA3)
...

0x8000 = 16383 / 32768 = 0.5 (offset)
0x2AAA = 16383 / 10922 = 1.5 (scale)


Actually, I think WORDs #7 and #8 can contain either UV offset/scaling or a 2nd UVset.
The vertex format flags may tell you what type of data is stored here, but that is only a guess.
Code: Select allVertex Format (Alternate)
=============
WORD position[4];
WORD uvset1[2];
WORD uvset2[2];          // either uvset2 or uv offset/scaling
BYTE bone_weights[4];	// sum to 255
BYTE bone_indices[4];
WORD unk[4];

Well I have no research on me (typing this from my phone)currently however the vertex structures for now im parsing with a giant select switch and size 36 and 40 seems to be dynamic (like normals are swapped with the vertex color. ) But yeah I think your right the drawcall table or vertex descriptor which describes what VBO,iBO and material file for set drawcall or primative mesh piece must somehow state what values are contained in the vertex structure being some FVF flags or something else. What interested me is bits.fx in the shader source code it proves that theres some bit flags in there, once again when im back home ill take another look

vertexdeclaration.inc.fx

VERTEX_DECL_POSITIONCOMPRESSED
VERTEX_DECL_POSITIONFLOAT
VERTEX_DECL_UV0
VERTEX_DECL_UV1
...

They don't say what the actual bits are for each flag, but just looking at the order of things gives
a basic layout of the format:
position | uv0 | uv1 | blend_weights | blend_indices | normal | color | tangent | binormal | ...

Perhaps these flags are defined in an XBOX or PS3 SDK that is only available to Developers. 

For stride 44 theres a blank unknown if i can recall but yeah thats the basic format if only I was home and the game was dx9 could easily get the bit values using Microsoft PIX
	//POS
	//UV
	//UV2
	//BoneWeights
	//BoneIndices
	//blankUnknown
	//Vertex normal
	//Vertex col
	//Bi-Normal
	//Tangents

Well i can answer this easy cause i posted that model (you should remove the link btw since it's against the rules to provide links to any model files in public =) )

I didn't rip any shaders actually... i only saved some screenshots from the game and tried to adjust the colors on the textures in Photoshop so that they look like ingame. The tangent space maps are already in the game files and you just need to swap some channels around to get them in their usual purple form (they are originally orange because one of the channels is stored in the alpha)
Tbh it is quite some work to set the materials properly because the game uses a lot of shared textures which need the color adjustments and also detail normal maps, which is what gives the pattern on the shirt for eg. I suppose with good mask maps and such you can also set materials without altering texture colors in any other good 3d app but i personally find coloring textures directly way easier.

Yeah it's basically just trying to get close to a screenshot xD

I think it should be okay^^ I'm just not so sure anymore because the rule updates for the forum are really strict about everything. The link should be okay now tho =)

I personally have to skip the research of character models as these usually contain "extra skinning' mode with 6 bones weights. my software does not support 6 bones weights and even worse, limited to 255 bone indices only . So, until I make considerations and upgrade to directx11 (by abandoning support of win XP), I'm pinned to vehicle models only.

I'm very unsure about dual UV layers yet, as I've pre-configured just few shaders for my software that vehicle uses (DriverGeneric. DriverCarGeneric, DriverCarPaint), and in most of cases only one uv channel is used there. I can say the uv scaling is both in a model file (xbg) and in material file for each material. you've seen it in "materialdescriptors" I guess as "NormalUVTiling", "DetailUVTiling" or something like that. the per-model uv scaling gives a "decompression" scaling for UV for entire model, while material UV scaling (tiling) configures scale on per-material level.

here's the muscle/muscle_03.xbg i'm working with:
[](http://sf.uploads.ru/KaE29.jpg)


and the same vehicle with dust/scratch/damage applied:
[](http://se.uploads.ru/QdauS.jpg)


unfortunately, the xbg model is tightly connected with havok physical model file. Literally, each vertex has bind reference  to affecting physical model. I haven't made any physics-file research to the moment, but this might certainly be a serious problem on putting models back to game.

P.S. I'll check the character model and port character materials to inspect the "color" issue you've talked about. may be I could find something on this particular case.

I've ported only DriverCloth shader yesterday, as it's a bit comprehensive task to adopt as much original data into available material information as possible. Since my shaders use different code and blending methods on multytexture layers, the result does not match perfectly, but overal look is very alike.

[](http://se.uploads.ru/CVmBY.jpg)

There could be multiple layers on DriverCloth shader, where Diffuse texture is premultiplied with DiffuseColor1 given as rgb in a material file. Additionally (as in most of shaders I've explored to the moment), the specular map is usually a per-channel mask texture, where .R is usually specular glossiness, and .G is often a colorization mask. Thus, for example, a DiffuseColor2 could be masked by SpecularMap green channel, so you could have multiple color clothes dress. The second diffuse texture is (usually grayscale) a premultiply or overlay details for fabric texture simulation (that's where my shader gives dark effect on pants - if I disable fabric detalization, pants are drawn with correct blue color; same on hat). Additionally, a normal map #2 can be used as displacement map to simulate small bumps or fabric texture.

So, in general, the correct color is usually "Diffuse1Color" premultiplied by DiffuseTexture1 and mixed with Diffuse2Color masked by Specmap.Green;

I'll port DriverHair and DriverEye today to see whether these works the same way.

To say, most of info is generally in "materialdescriptor" folder as you've mentioned earlier. Some shaders specify a per-vertex color masking info, so per-vertex color component is NOT the color of mesh, it's a per-vertex effects masking. E.g. wetness areas are masked via vertices color channel (R on some shaders, G on another). Quite comprehensive to deal with as I see...

Vertex position and UV scaling (yes, vertices are also scaled per model):

@offset 36 VPscale = [float, float]
@offset 48 UVscale = [float, float]

These values are used with a HLSL [mad](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/bb147165%28v=vs.85%29.aspx) function inside the shaders, which basically means Vp = int16*VPscale.y + VPscale.x. The same for UV coordinates.
There is only one set per file/model. Further UV scaling is handled with material tiling properties, as Oleg mentioned.

> Hello

my importer  for Blender 249:

Update 2014-07-01:
-fix weighting for some meshes

http://www.mediafire.com/download/hd1m3 ... -01%5D.zip


support: uv,weighting,bones,autotexturing
autotexturing work when use original location xbg file and needed material.bin file exists

problem:translation and scale uvmapping
how fix: go to line 7 and 8 and change UVTrans and UVScale 


script is not perfect but maybe will be helpfull for you for full reversing format

When i attempt to run script for the file Blender249-WatchDogsImporter-2014-07-01.blend ...
it gives me a error on line 24 (the print command).
I'm perplexed. I would love to check out some of the car, buildings and prop models in watch dogs and do intensive research.

Anyone care to lend a hand on how to get the script to work?
This is my first time using blender by the way. I'm a 3d max user.

You have to open it with Blender 2.49, it doesn't work with newer versions.

I tried to install you blender importer but I cant figure out where the files have to go. I use modo for modeling and have no clue about any blender versions. 

A pointer would be nice

I know Cra0's rig is more or less messed up and is in need of repairs atm, but has there been some progress made with the .xbg models? I mean, will we be getting support for exporting custom meshes and importing them back into the game?

Hey Cra0 

do you think its possible to make Aiden coat moves like in this trailer ? start 1:00 : [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmwyW-Q960M](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmwyW-Q960M)

in the final game his coat is literally attached to the very low end of his back, in the trailer its attached higher to the middle of his back, wich let it move freely when walking/running, maybe removing some bones attachments from the xbg model ? because the physics seems to be already working properly in the game for it, its the same for his coat belt, they look more attached , sorry if am saying stupid stuff about bones, i have no experience with that

There are over 100 bones controlling Aiden's coat and coat-tails.  It's highly animated.  See bones named PL_Coat_SMUNode.

her's a more direct comparison [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_A6Z3gkXlk](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_A6Z3gkXlk) 

you can notice aiden coat in the final game is like glued to the low end of his back wich prevent it from moving despit the physics for it seems to be there , do you think it would requiere some animation editing to make like that ? or working on the model withe bones could do the trick ?

I've submitted an update at [www.zmodeler3.com](http://www.zmodeler3.com), so it's available for download. Anyone with ZM3 license (or with trial license) can take a look on what have been done so far.

Unfortunately, HAVOK *.hkx files are not modded to the moment. Also, It will take a lot of time to write guide materials, but I'll post them on my forum in the nearest few days.

If you have any modding-specific or format-specific questions, I could assist and reply.

Character models are not yet possible to export. There are two hierarchy-specific fragments that I have no idea about. they are parsed, data layout is known, but I've got no idea what this stuff is all about. I'll make some tests later, but have big doubts on result currently. So, no Aiden modification can be applied yet.

Scenery or building models are not yet exportable, as I haven't found the original building model to test. If someone could locate the building where's Aiden first flat/shelter is located, I will be thankful for the link/filepath. Thus, I could mod and test mods next to last save game position.

P.S. I'm not sure whether any tools were made for "nbCF" (binary XML files) converting, you can find these files as *.ci or *_reference.skeleton and sometimes inside XBG the file itself. If needed, I could post the format of these files, so external browsing/editing tools for these files could be created.

I guess you missed this thread, they are way past worrying about model format, and working on replacing models.

dude, just read the other thread, then you would get the answers you seek. obviously they wouldn't be replacing models if the format wasn't the same.

Bah then I don't know why those idiots are trying to do model swaps. It's like trying to do a heart transplant and you don't have the right heart yet. I will add this to my ever growing list of importers to do. Hopefully someone will beat me to it.

If a public and freely available converter hasn't been done by someone by the time I get to it, I'll do one. Nobody should be forced to pay for this.

I however want to finish up my work on Hitman2016 and Deus Ex: Mankind Divided first before moving on to this. Not to mention it's the Holidays. So will be awhile.

As I understand, plugin will be public, but you will have to PAY for it to SAVE the resulting files. Anyone correct me if I'm wrong.

Yep, it changed. 

It follows the old format, but there was a version bump, so there are some new bits here and there.
The old scripts won't load the new models.

A character model would probably show where all the changes are, but this is just a flat minimap of San Francisco:
minimap.JPG
a step in the right direction in terms of the map. despite it being just a minimap, progress is still progress

 keep up the good work

I guess you missed this thread, they are way past worrying about model format, and working on replacing models.
viewtopic.php?f=10&t=15567
if only I had the money to buy this   then I could replace the shitty "generic mexican gang" with actual San Francisco/Oakland Norteno Gang models that I got from someone a long while ago.



because fuck Ubisoft for messing up the mexican gangs of the Bay Area

Don't worry, today I start on the free importer. I'm already off to a good start:

Ok, here's the first release of Watchdogs 2 importer for blender.

I have to say this format is probably the worst model format I've ever seen. I did my best with what I had to work with.

As stated by Wobble, the UV coordinates are arbitrarily scaled, so while models will have UV maps, they will likely not be the right scale or position for their matching texture. You may have to do your own adjustment.

I ran the importer through all the samples posted to this thread, it correctly loads all except for 2, these two supply face data outside the assigned face parameters. As models have multiple materials, it's unclear what material these should be assigned to. (it's a really bad format heh).  So for now I skip them. Thankfully that type of model seems pretty rare. If I figure out a way to reliably determine their material assignment, I'll fix that problem.
if you see a model with a material named "Base" or "Base.00x", it's a sign some faces were skipped.

The importer will try to import a texture, if the proper files are in the proper places (model, material, and textures are in folders as extracted). but often the necessary material files are missing, so don't count on it.

As well there's always the possibility there's a format or crazy configuration of the bloated model format I've not run across, if you find a model that doesn't load at all, let me know.

The importer is for Blender 2.70 and above, and if you need to know how to install, see my previous tutorial here: 
[viewtopic.php?p=103131#p103131](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?p=103131#p103131)

Enjoy.

P.S. I also want to thank and credit Szkaradek123 for his Watchdogs 1 Blender importer, which I borrowed a couple functions out of (the "Skip a big mess" and "xbt 2 DDS" functions.

Edit: newer version below.

I just released a Watchdogs 2 blender Import for 2.7x above... Sure no export. as I said, format is a nightmare. there's just too much unknown to ever reliably recreate a valid xbg.

I could go back and do one for Watchdogs 1, I may do that one day. but not a high priority atm.

Might be, a lot of models are split up into multiple sections. but I'd have to see the file in question to say for sure.

Ok I fixed a couple of problems, all of the bodies supplied load fully now.  

However, these super large heads still don't load for now.  (Pers01 (wrench) loads fine, head is just under 1 meg in size.  Pers05/Pers06 heads don't load, heads are 5-6 megs in size).  I suspect these are the very high rez heads used for cutscenes, and they stored them in a different format than regular meshes. There should be lower rez heads for gameplay, just like wrench has. You should try to find those.

If I can figure out what they are doing on these cutscene heads, I'll add support, but it may take awhile.

Enjoy

I checked a text with file list and there seems to be only 1 head model used for both cutscene and gameplay... or at least only one xbg head file, there's a dpdx right after but I have no idea what's that for. 

Would be awesome if you can figure out how to import the others' head xbg, volfin!

Ok, I figured out a kludge for these heads. there's just a ton of extra data that isn't model related shoved in the file. out of 5 megs of data, nearly 4 is this fluff, I think it's related to facial expression generation. But in any case, I found a way to jump around it, that seems to work reliably enough. It works on the 3 head samples I have.

Thanks, it works good! But I still have some questions: How can you extract the textures and the xbg files? They're probably in the .dat files but how does one unpack them?

Edit:
Is that it? I'm using the WD2Extractor and I'm currently extracting the patch.fat file. What else can you or should you unpack to find more things (models,sounds...)

I decided to try my luck with Ninja Ripper. After a lot of crashes, fucked up UVs and other problems, I finally succeeded. Here's Marcus

Is there a way to batch convert the xbg files with the blender script or a noesis script? 

Using this script: [viewtopic.php?f=16&t=11602&start=20](https://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=11602&start=20)

Mesh only. importer doesn't support skeletons.I'm porting addon to 2.8 blender and I'm nearly done.
also I noticed section called Skeleton and you mentioned in the one of the the latest posts the "bone dictionary" so I thought skeleton is also supported

also I'm getting this error when I'm trying to load model from .\Watch_Dogs2\data_win64\worlds\san_francisco\_ex\graphics\characters\wd2\persons_of_interest\pers01\pers01.xbg

yeah there was some code about skeletons but it's unused. I copy over a lot of code at the start of every project in case I need it. that was part of that boilerplate code.

As for your error, you need to move the files to a directory in the root, the filepath is much too long for it to handle, Python can only work with file paths 255 characters long or shorter.

thanks for the reply!
can you add a checker for the long path to bypass it when it throws error and still load the model?

edit:
I moved my game into F:\WD2 but still gets the error:

```

and for some files I'm getting this:

no there's no way to recover from that problem. you need to move the extracted files to a folder in the root of the drive with a short name, I usually name a folder 'x' and move extracted stuff there.

UTF errors I know nothing about. maybe a problem with your windows character set.

```
   s=''
   for j in range(0,long): 
       lit =  unpack('c',filehandle.read(1))[0]
       print("ord of "+str(lit)+" is "+str(ord(lit)))
       if ord(lit)!= 0:
           s+=lit.decode("utf-8")
       else:
           break;
   return s
```

some models works, some not because of this error. any suggestions?

Here's a new version that should fix problems with bone dictionary processing.
Enjoy

Do you have any plans for the importer to support Watch Dogs Legion?
I tried yours and Szkaradek123's import but both seem to be incompatible.

Can anyone give me a very good tutorial on extraction and concerting of models (vehicle and peds only) from the Watch Dogs series to a good 3d modeling software.
