- Post Title: Secret of Mana (Remake) Models

Hello to you all! 
(Since this is my first post)

I would like to ask if there's any possible way to extract / convert the models from the Secret of Mana remake?

I tries also 3DXripper and Ninja Ripper, but both wont let the game start

(Or I did something wrong)

The files are mostly named with file extensions included but all end with ".phyre"

examples are :

Models :

- e0029_00.dae.part.phyre (suggests this is a .dae file)

Textures :

- e0029_00.dds.part.phyre (suggests this is a dds file)

If anyone has a solution for this I would be super happy!

Thanks in advance

(Can provide files if asked for)

My SAO: Hollow Realization (also a phyre game) program seems to be working fine with the sample texture and model.



I need to see more complex models to say that it is 100% compatible with Secret of Mana. I will pm you about that. Here is the link to the SAO tool, if anyone wants to try it : [viewtopic.php?f=16&t=17714](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=17714)

Hello!  Would anyone know how to re-inject these files/ re-encode them as .phyre files to be used within the game??

I'm using this program at the moment to rip textures and models, but would -love- to be able to re-insert them for some mods!

Making a tool that inserts modded textures is doable.

Inserting models would be trickier though. I am not sure if anyone would want to bother with that.

Honestly, the textures would be the first thing I'd like to mod, so that tool would be amazing.

I could definitely modify the models a bit, too - but all I want to do is give Randi some bicep definition and darker toned skin, give Primm some hips, and make Popoi 20% smaller.
Eventually, costume mods might be fun.

Any way the files could be re-uploaded again? I reall would like the main 3 characters of the game, because they are so awesome ;_;
