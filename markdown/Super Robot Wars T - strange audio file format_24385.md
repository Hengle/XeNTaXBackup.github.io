- Post Title: Super Robot Wars T - strange audio file format

this is one of the files i have unpacked from an .AWB archive, i can't seem to find a way to convert it to other formats like MP3, could anyone take a look at it ?

It's standard HCA Audio [http://wiki.xentax.com/index.php/HCA_Audio](http://wiki.xentax.com/index.php/HCA_Audio)

If you'll change file extension to HCA, you will be able to play it in foobar with vgmstream plugin.

Also, what game is it from?

Just an FYI, you should be able to throw the entire awb into vgmstream without the need to unpack them to individual HCAs.
