Has anyone been able to extract the .ssres files in the new Space Siege demo?  The Siege Editor and other utilities to extract Dungeon Siege/Dungeon Siege II resources files don't work, unfortunately, but I would assume that GPG hasn't changed the file layout much since DS2.  It would be nice to poke around in the .ssres files to see if modding will be possible when the full game comes out in a couple of weeks.

All files compressed with zlib one by one, inside the .ssres files. Program needed, to extracting.

But if you rename the header with hex editor from SSg1 to DSig, you can able to decompress all files with Tankviewer.
