- Post Title: Plastic Memories (PS VITA)

Hello. I want to translate the game "Plastic memories" on PS VITA into russian. 
Before that, I translated several games on PC and Android.
All game files in bin format (config_body, eboot, font_body, image_body, motion_body, scenario_body, script_body etc.)
But if some of these files is opened in the hex editor, then the file header says:
6D 64 66 00 | mdf

Can you please tell me how to open this archive?
Thanks for help!
