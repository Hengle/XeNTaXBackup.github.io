- Post Title: Help doubling size of Noesis python script for textures half the size of what I have

Apologies if this is in the incorrect forum.

The attached script was designed to work with Switch textures, but the ones I am trying to rip are from the PC version, which are double-size.  Hopefully this is an easy fix?
