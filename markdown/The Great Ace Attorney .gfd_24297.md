- Post Title: The Great Ace Attorney .gfd

Hello, XeNTaX!
Have some problem with understanding .gfd in The Great Ace Attorney. CAPCOM change this format from the last time and i can understand some values. For example - number 7 in font_00.gfd.

41 00 00 02 42 - 12 and 02 = width and height.
43 5C 08 - distance from upper border and left border of texture. 
But for what all others?
