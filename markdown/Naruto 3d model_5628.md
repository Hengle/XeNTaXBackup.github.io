I would like to request a 3d model for sasuke curse mark level 2, i tried to do it myself by extracting the .cpk, and trying to open the .ccs file with the CCS2OBJ program, but the .obj files dont appear anywhere, the game is (PSP) Naruto Shippuden - Ultimate Ninja Heroes 3 please help me in any way you can even if its just advice, but id prefer a model  I have located the ccs files that contain the models if anyone needs them.

Get the naruto 2/3/Dragon thing/Special  games for the wii, wii scrubber, and brres viewer. There isn't too many characters you wont get from that.
