- Post Title: [PC] Crysis 2 textures

Today i unpacked the textures.pak file (thx aluigi for the QuickBMS script) and installed the nVidia Photoshop .DDS plugin but when i try to open the texture files, photoshop gave me this:

I think i need a tool to convert the texture files to .jpg/.png format and convert it back to .dds.

Tried with DDS Converter but no luck.

Can someone tell me what i need to do to open those files?

You should use the official MODTools to unpack pak files.
Which version is this, pc, x360, ps3? Sample DDS?
