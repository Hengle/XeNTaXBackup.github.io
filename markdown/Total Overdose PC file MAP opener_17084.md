- Post Title: Total Overdose PC file MAP opener

Hello Guys,

I am obsessed with this game called "Total Overdose", released during 2005. I want to recreate the game in
Unity or Unreal. But to get a sense of scale for the level layout, I am trying to get either a freeroam camera
hack or a MAP viewer, so I can view the complete scene files of the game.  They used an in-House game engine
called "KAPOW SYSTEMS 3D" engine.  If someone could help me, that would be great.
