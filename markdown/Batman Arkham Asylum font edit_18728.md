- Post Title: Batman Arkham Asylum font edit

Hello. I translate all .int files on my language. In menu it's fine, but in game subtitles don't work properly, without some letters. And dialogs I edit with HEXeditor, game don't understand.
Can I somehow edit font or add letters?

On which platform do you want the translation? PC, X360, PS3?

Hi, here it is, you must edit font bitmap example in GIMP and replace letter you dont want (ex. Ñ with Ń) you cannot add you own letter, only replace with other. If you finish it, send me texture and i repack it back to file.
