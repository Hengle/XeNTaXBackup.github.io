- Post Title: Raoh model from FOTNS Ken's Rage [Ps3] ?

Hi guys, I'm having some trouble trying to get the model file for Raoh from the ps3 version of fist of the north star ken's rage.  I did some searching on the forums and other sites and I'm still kind of confused on what to do.  I have the LINKDATA files and I went through them with a hex editior and I'm pretty sure they contain the obj files I'm looking for but I'm unsure how to extract them from there.

This old thread is what I found sort of helpful but i'm still kind of confused: [viewtopic.php?f=10&t=6170&hilit=Hokuto+Musou+Kenshiro](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=6170&hilit=Hokuto+Musou+Kenshiro)

Any help would be appreciated, thanks in advance.
