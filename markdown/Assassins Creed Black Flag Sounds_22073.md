Hello from the past . . .

Well, I'm looking for some sound effects from the game (not the shantys, I already have, thanks)
May one of you guys own the PC version of the game (unlike me who only has the store version)
and given kindness of a stranger to approach me to provide me with a link or something

First, let me say thank you for pay attention to my quest.

I don't need the entire sound effects of the game that would be way to much for you to ask.

Some sound effects made by the ship movement and sound which played if you entering a enemy frequented area
just came in my mind. One sound I'm looking for where played if you repair your ship in the menue (those hammering stomps)

As far as I know the Ubisoft gamefiles are sometime difficult to extract or convert so in case you are able to get the soundbank
which contains all effects only then I would take the hard part of getting single soundfiles from there.

I would if I could... unfortunately I don't have the files because I only own the PlayStation version of the game.
Anyway, if you can't provide it's okay thanks for your time  :)
