Hi
The utility does not work with anti-cheats.

First of all, the security of the game has greatly improved since the first one, and for good reason since its an online game only and the first one was filled with cheaters and people using trainers and such.

Second, why don't you just use the unpacker already made for the game and the already made 3dsMax script as well to import what ever geometry you want to your hearts content, it supports both first and second game.

Search function is your best friend, try it and you'll love it, no need to struggle with other software.

I have followed your suggestion, even if there are a lot of confusion of files and lods, however where is the textures ?

Assuming you used the unpacker that got all files out, with XBG as meshes and the textures as XBT, they are DDS inside, there was tool that can make them work, I no longer remember where it was posted unfortunately.
I also remember trying to access the textures a very long time ago with Dragon UnPACKer 5.

And yes your right the files are kind of a mess, no names no file/folder structure, its all pretty much a guessing game, but its all we have right now.

Good luck.

XBGmover was designed to work and synchronized with the first game only and its unpacker, I personally never tried it with the second game to see the results, so expect unwanted results.

That is correct, XBGmover will place the known meshes based by the material files which they hold folder structure with some main textures but not all, and that's how it guesses few meshes only, now the crazy part is that, majority of moving parts or those than can be customized, are spread out all over the _Unknown folder, that's where the guessing game begins, you need to import one by one, take notes as to which one works, then move to another, so on and so forth, sounds like fun right?

Well, it is what it is, for now at least, I hope.
