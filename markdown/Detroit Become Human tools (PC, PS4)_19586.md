Detroit Become Human tools. (PC, PS4)
Supports all characters with textures, skeletons and weights. Also most map objects will export.

Tool usage:

0. Change detroit.ini with your paths. On PS4 you can choose only chapters you need to extract. Base BIGFILE will have all models, chapters will mostly have map objects, but also a few characters. On PC there's only one big index file.

1. To make a list, run the tool without parameters
Example: Detroit > list.txt
It will create a list of potentially extractable game packages and their sizes (in bytes). MOST of them will have models, but there will be some with only videos, sounds or animations, these will be skipped with error message "not supported".

A list of all noticable models is included

2. To extract a package, run with 1 parameter (package code)
Example: Detroit D0F
It will make ASCII models, ASCII & SMD skeletons, just like it was before with my B2S/HR tool. ASCII format will have all UV pairs and extended info for correct bone rotations. Noesis plugin that reads them is included. For skeletal models you need to copypaste skeleton: open ascii file with model in text editor, delete 1st line ("0"), and copypaste the whole ascii skeleton there.

You can run the list created before as a batch file, it will export all packages you choose.

Half of textures will have no extension. Again, like in B2S, those must be converted to TGA with another tool (detroit_img.exe). Use a batch to convert all files in one run (included)

Beware, the tool can trigger antivirus false-positive, because they think its "suspicious".

3. To extract all animations, type "Detroit anims"
4. To extract all sounds, type "Detroit snd"

How to use animations tool:

Oh my. Great work!! These preview images look amazing. Detroit: Become Human was definitely one, if not the best game 2018, in my opinion. I'm so appy to see it's still in the works, not forgotten and out there somehow.

Thank you so much for sharing these WIPs with us!

I'm very interested in the model of this work, so I'm happy if I'm get the file...
I have some knowledge of corrections and convert them(example XPS), so I might be able to help someone.

You need to edit the detroit.ini file.

Have you exported these games before?

ASCII plugin don't work - Noesis give traceback error.

UPD: textures need be converted with Noesis after detroit_img (I batch DDS and TGA to PNG)
Still don't work ascii plugin

I didn't make some serious amount of posts since I joined here 2016, reading mostly, amazing community and guys give their best not to ignore newbies and help everyone.
You just post on 18 of March that you got an error, what is today 31 of March?

I recommend you use Blender 2.79b.  Because the blender 2.8 has not been released yet.  There are still a lot of problems. Use the appropriate scripts for "Blender 2.79b".

I am getting the same error both with blender 2.79b and 2.8 with the latest XPS scripts. Do we need to convert the ascii files with the fmt_xps_ascii script from Daemons tools?
Edit: I figured out that is the script for Noesis but even with Noesis I get trace back errors...

Take a look [https://www.deviantart.com/comments/1/7 ... 4714136164](https://www.deviantart.com/comments/1/790126541/4714136164)

For Noesis, you can use the plugin included in attachments.  (The Neosis plugin in this "detroit.7z" may be better in some ways.)
If you're still having problems, specify the file you think is problematic.

These are exclusive games for PS4. I don't think they'il come to the PC. But I would really like it to happen.

they will probably encrypt the data, like it was with Dissidia NT on PC
right now, all PS4 files are available unencrypted

Hey all
I use blender, DAZ and xnalara alot. I have fairly good knowledge importing models so I am interested in trying it

I too am very interested in this topic with extracting a few models of DBH

Can anyone provide me a PM to find the unencrypted PS4 files so I can attempt to create models.

I will be sure to provide downloads of my creations via blend websites and deviantart

I also have knowledge of 3D models but I can not get files. After all, their friends or not.
I have also posted some works on DeviantArt, and show the ability but it doesn't make sense.
Contribute for them and the people of the forum, and if it is recognized, there will be opportunities.

I've made some contributions in the past, such as making scripts easier to use, but it doesn't seem to make much sense.

Hey all

I was given a link with the supposed files.

Such as this is the files I was given.
Bigfile_PS4.idm
Bigfile_PS4.dat
Bigfile_PS4.d01
Bigfile_PS4.d02
Bigfile_PS4.d03
Bigfile_PS4.d04
Bigfile_PS4.d05
Bigfile_PS4.dep

I actually placed them into
C:\games\detroit

I also tried placing the Detroit unpack archive (detroit.exe) into the same directory

I edited the ini file to reflect the filenames above.

Sadly I get a unhandled exception: outofmemoryexception error

So I am thinking the files I got may be different to what detroit.exe is expecting...

I will wait to see if anyone out there has gotten past this step.

I'd like to know if anyone knows where the download link came from. (I am referring to the 12GB of packed files)
I am a bit suspicious of its authenticity.

Regards
Shaun

^just edit the config to the .idm file. thats all needed. This is how your config file should look like:
C:\games\detroit\Bigfile_PS4.idm

Anyways, I tried to extract a model, but has no eyes, at least the uw map is messed up. Any help??

I have only FBX Kara, but I have no UVs in my eyes.
You may want to make your own UVs, or port your eyes from other models that have UVs set.
The eyes are the same for all models, so they should work if sized together. Just like Markus ported eyes from other androids

Every model i've seen had its eyes with UVs. They are usually in a separate file, not main model file.

Hmm thanks, will take a look!

EDIT:
Can't seem to find them, can you give a hint please? for example I have extracted 1A88, ive got 4 files:
1A88_267.ascii this is the main model.
1A88_269_skel.ascii this is the skeleton (i copied this into the 267 ascii file so it would work)
1A88_269_skel.smd this is the skeleton again
1A88_274.ascii this is some other model, looks like a bomb with a plane, definitely not eyes

1A88_274.ascii must have eyes. That "bomb" is all collision meshes put at origin.

It really had eyeball like things, thanks! but another problem though: while UV map seems correct, they iris of the eye looks extra big. Dunno what im doing wrong here unfortunately  tried to shift it but it just doesnt wanna add up.

I got a model extracted, I seen textures folder has some images

I was having issues before due to for some reason I must have misspell my file location in the ini file!.. so In file explorer I used the (SHIFT+Right click file and COPY PATH) and pasted the location removed the "  " and extracted my first model,

also only the IDM file is required. I verify that!

The Noesis Tool doesn't seem to be loading textures to the model. so I am looking at this now

Gimp (Free Image Editor) Along with the (free DDS importer) allows you to convert textures.. as does Noesis I think.

I will update you if I work out textures.. and you let me know if you get them working,

I got the models imported into blender no problems...
Using DAE export 
and also exporting as ascii.. (The ascii doesnt work straight from the detroit.exe) I needed to export ascii from noesis and it went into blender..

For those cannot get noesis working to import ascii, you need the FMT_XPS_0_9_4 file in the python folder.

Hi,

I am having to re-save most .TGA files due to them showing as black in blender.

I am noticing most textures for clothes are only 512x512, some 1024x1024 (This seems very small) is this normal for PS4 Games??
most face textures are 2048x2048

They seem very low, (I am used to working with SKYRIM's Modding community and having 4K and 8K textures haha :p

Many textures stay as DDS and not converted. so I am converting them in Gimp 2.0 with DDS Plugin exporting them to .TGA

Here is Kara in blender spending only a few minutes on her.
It's good to see the textures are assigned properly and coordinated 

BIG Thanks to the Tools Creator!  Cheers mate

Yes the base textures are often pretty small because they use tiled detail textures over them to get clothing details and such.

This doesn't extract general object models? like furniture? cups? buildings? wall textures? etc?

or are the 1157 list.txt it? or are they in the "chapters as map object?" I'm abit confused.

I dont recommend using this plugin, it loses important information about bone rotations.
Unfortunately, that plugin author has no idea how bone rotations work, even after many people tried explaining that rotations are important.

Use the plugin provided with the tool.

because you have to merge skeleton with model first
it will happen with any plugin
or you were loading a static model? with no bones?

Sorry, I haven't dealt with this specific process before. Noesis is new to be too.
But in your OP you said "For skeletal models you need to copypaste skeleton... etc"
How do i do this "merge skeleton with model first"

I was told to open the ASCII files..
Copy and paste the skeleton ASCII text
To the mesh file.

From a fellow user here "Dave"

Open the skel.ascii file and copy everything that's in there.
Then open the model.ascii file (the first one) and paste everything replacing the 0 in the first line.

Best way to use the program is open the files with about 5MB to 15MB files..

The character will open as long as the code has following files

Eg: CAC

You have 
CAC_162.ascii
CAC_164.skel.ascii
CAC_164.skel.smd
CAC_168.ascii

I have learnt that a 3D Model to open required a skeleton.
You have to open the CAC_162.ascii in noesis

Please note the numbers after the CAC are not important.. those 4 files above are required to open a model..
But of course CAC would be different for each character or 3D Model.

So your supposed to open the following two items in notepad or better yet Notepad++ and make adjustments as Dave mentioned
CAC_162.ascii
CAC_164.skel.ascii

I actually have problems with the method I just explain

The model wont import. But it doesn't give an error also after copy and paste the skeleton into the main mesh

I have been using the other plugin and just re-export and it goes into blender fine.

For me I don't care about skeleton because xna skeleton are not really what I want to use to animate in blender.

That's my usage case anyways..

I hope daemon can weigh in on more detail about process to use his plugin

If xnalara is not your choice end result program.. (armature not important to you..) just find the other xnalara plugin for noesis

Import the mesh and export in xnalara format and it imports to blender fine. I instantly just delete the broken armature anyways..

Yeah the other plugin works but i need the correct skeletons and bones, its vital to what i'm trying to do.

First of all, its not my plugin. I'm not making noesis plugins and I dont have plans to start. I just wanted to help people with loading into other 3d software - that's why its included. Long time ago somebody gave me this plugin, it was made from another plugin, or something. The only thing i did, is at some point (about a year ago) I've added bone rotations to it, so if you import/export into FBX or any other format, you have all proper bone rotations. That's it about the plugin.

Now when you merge 2 text files, skeleton and model, make sure you don't break the ASCII format. There must be no empty lines or extra zeroes.

First "0" line in the main model is number of bones. I made it there so you can load the model without bones if you want to.

If you want bones, delete that "0", and merge both files, skeleton first, and make sure there are no empty lines, and you dont delete anything other than that zero line.

Can we use these tools to extract the sound files. Perhaps I can give users a raw clean version of the famous 28 stab wounds quote.

Can we use these tools to extract the sound files. Perhaps I can give users a raw clean version of the famous 28 stab wounds quote.

I'm curious about this too! Imagine a game-rip of the soundtrack!  

Also, how can i use the bonenames.txt? My character bones are just named bone000, bone001 etc.
But as I see it in the ascii skel file the bones are named, probably Noesis export renames them?

EDIT, dont wanna double post: i'm having problems with my RK900 model, the eyes are ok now (had to alter the UV map), but his texts are missing (his serial number etc on his jacket), also, bones from his right shoulder (if you mirror the model as it should look) are missing?? But I checked it on the RK800 (Connor) model, and he's missing them too. Is this a known problem? Also, this happens if you move his left shoulder: (every other bone is working perfectly)

Can anyone help on this?

Looks good.

Any close up on the face? Did you use all base textures for face? I'm doing her right now in UE4 and running into issues with her roughness/spec/sss tex and just decided to create new textures for her that works with UE skin shading model while still using the albedo/normal map. (or it could be that im working on the uniform robotic model)

Also have you tried exporting model to UE4 and run into the problem where it creates 37 models instead of 1 model with multiple mats.

I used only the original maps, but some extra work could be done to enhance the skin reflection quality.

I didn't try to export the models to Unreal, but there are no reasons to get any importation error if you cleaned the mesh. ( Welding + individual parts renaming )

detroit.ini looks like this
C:\Games\detroit\BigFile_PS4.idm

I suppose to see some crazy coding in cmd when hit enter, but no luck.

It's pretty straight forward to be honnest. After extraction :
Split each maps in specific folders RMA / Albedos / Normals 
Flip vertically the couple of usable .dds files you can read without conversion with the provided tool 
Convert the others and invert the alpha channel to make them usable

The problem here is your file renaming. You are supposed to already have BigFile_PS4.idm in your folder. Undo your renaming and it should work. Your path il good.

My old videos.  Models show how you can export.

Building, running and model export of "Detroit Become Human tools"-->Youtube [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xLN5jGNpNK8&t](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xLN5jGNpNK8&t)
Arrangements for the eyes, Noesis plugins and Blender script -->Youtube [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLjVrQy0GO0&t](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLjVrQy0GO0&t)

I hope it helps.  

Editing textures is already easy. But if you want to create a good texture of advanced level is really tedious.

You can make it extract a full list by saying

Will create a list of all assets from the files you have written in detroit.ini

I'll give you one task. Find the audio file for Connor's "28 stab wounds" line and put it up on YouTube. After that, see if you can convert the rest into playable format and submit them to this site: [www.sounds-resource.com](http://www.sounds-resource.com)

I hope it can help :

Oh i see.. what threw me off was the fact that the textures were flipped which i thought the UV corrected since the albedo appear correctly. Didn't know it didn't. No wonder what ever roughness/spec i picked were way off.

EDIT: Even with this, the maps simply aint good enough. the roughness in particular.

Quick question, is animations really that had to extract? I remember asking about hitman (2016) animations and you said you didn't have plans on it. However later on we talked about Quantum Break and i sent you a model with its skeleton and you said you were gonna look into it later.

[https://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php? ... 6&start=60](https://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=17726&start=60)

I know you graciously gifted us Detroit's model and skeletons, but i wanted to ask why are animations never extracted? i would love either Quantum Break or Detroit animations, it would be a meal deal. I stopped working on QB meanly because i didn't have anims to get things done as quick as i wanted.

It heavily varies from game to game, but yes, in general, animations are the most complicated thing.
Quantum break is using morpheme, which i already reversed, thats why i said i had plans. But still, it will be very annoying to implement.

Damn, Started to doubt for that Detroit List because lots of files were uncompressed segments,
as i said:
there will be some with only videos, sounds or animations, these will be skipped with error message "not supported"

Does this only work with Detroit Become Human or does this work with other games like Beyond Two Souls & Heavy Rain?

It's pretty straight forward to be honnest. After extraction :
Split each maps in specific folders RMA / Albedos / Normals 
Flip vertically the couple of usable .dds files you can read without conversion with the provided tool 
Convert the others and invert the alpha channel to make them usable

How did you solve the texture looking yellow problem? even are using the converter that came with @daemon1 program.

Still several passes on skin/lips/hair/eyes i wanna do before i get the full grasp of it.  I still want to re-create the entire first mission with Connor. But still haven't figured out how to fix textures and normal maps that are yellow/orange and just plain discolored

The pics look really great! Which software/renderer did you use? 
And yes, those yellow-colored textures are the only problems I'm having now.

Unreal engine 4.

Maybe @chachachat can explain about the yellow colored textures.

The upper one is an original, damaged hand texture of Connor/RK900. The bottom one is the original hand texture I recolored a bit cause it looked yellowish too (although not as yellow as the damaged hand one.)

         -I did not play the game just watched videos on the internet.

It's a normal texture.  (The blue channel looks normal.) 
This is a texture map of which character? (The code in the list?)   If this character belongs to a dead time, it may be yellowed in this way. (So it's like decaying after death.)    Or like any chemical reaction.

Or you can edit the blue channel.
 Like this, Edit as desired

EDIT: also, does anyone know which memory address points to the Detroit Bridge scene mesh? (the one where you can unlock the friend or hostile path with Hank)

General stuff and some early chapters are stored in the main big files, the rest together with the chapter data in the chunk big files. All the audio for a chapter (both SFX and music, excluding dialog) are grouped together as a singular audio bank using the Audiokinetic Wwise BNK format ([http://wiki.xentax.com/index.php/Wwise_ ... nk_(*.bnk)](http://wiki.xentax.com/index.php/Wwise_SoundBank_%28*.bnk%29)). Extraction of the individual unnamed WEM files is pretty easy after that. I converted them to plain OGG using ww2ogg. 

Since they are unnamed I had to figure it all out by listening to the tracks, which was awful as you got 445 audio banks and 33000 audio files (this game is huge!). But since they are grouped by chapter listening to the biggest sized files usually gives you a quick indication which chapter this is and most of the music tracks for that chapter. Bitrate isn't the best sadly, but decent.

The game does index the banks and can address the WEM files by name as well, but I have only figured out how that works to 50% and didn't care enough to complete the research there. I was already finished making the compilation at that point lol.

If anyone wants to extract the banks for himself, ideally you have knowledge how Quantic Dream's IDM files and Data Containers work. If you do, the communicator type you are looking for is 1032 (CSNDBKDT). Since being stored in Data Containers, they might be segs compressed. Most of them aren't and the tools I write for myself automatically handle segs so I don't really know if there were any that were segs compressed lol

Otherwise the good old file scraping method should work too, just finding the file ending could sometimes be a bit tricky I guess (and you would miss any segs ones)

Sorry it's asked so much, but could anyone PM me the files? I do a lot of 3D renders and work and I'd love to be able to test out these models
i suggest posting links to your renders here, so people can see. Otherwise i doubt about someone just registered with no messages on a forum.

Why doesn't someone just share the game files?  Why should anyone have to prove they're "worthy" of getting these files?  I've searched for a copy of the game online - all I've found is either fake torrents or the game's PKGs that can't be decrypted because no-one has the encryption key.  The few people I've tried contacting about getting the files either refuse to respond or refuse to share the files, so what - I'm SOL?

Daemon1 - I'm honestly not trying to be rude or dickish about this, it's just that I've been on the receiving end of the "prove yourself worthy" line so long I'm honestly just sick and tired of it.

Do you even know the rules of this site about sharing links to such data, or even what does this all mean, piracy n shit, it's not like you sharing youtube video, you all should go to jail, hell yeah  Me too....   

Original links are unavailable for months, but I got stashed em in my google drive 854 B.C , 
back then I didn't gave it to people like candies , recently, one dude said that he saw Detroit characters models in porn anime, was afraid of this to come, plenty of Detroit models available on internet now so what a heck...

Nobody is talking about pirating the game.  Just sharing the archives to extract the game's models.

Daemon1 - I'm sorry for bringing this to your thread.  I've just gotten so frustrated from trying to find these files, and NO ONE seems willing to help.

did you even read what I said up there, I clearly stated that I have files uploaded, since many people asked for link, after originals expired, no need to be worthy hahaha, all you needed is to send me pm to give you my google drive link to such download.
But yeah I didn't write PM me in first place so you got confused...

I was finally able to find a generous individual who PM'd me links to the DBH files.  The reason I got frustrated was because at the time there were no answers.  No one was responding, no one was posting any useful info, there was just nothing.

Could somebody please send me the game files? I do a lot of model ripping/rendering and it would be useful to have the original files rather than relying on other people’s rips, also, not all models are available online.
Any help would be appreciated.

Edit: Never mind, somebody was nice enough to send me the files.

For those who are interested, I've created a basic "nude" skin for the DBH females, based on the textures extracted from the game (so no details).  Drop me a PM.

Kind of an odd question, but has anyone found the android textures for Kara?  I've tried extracting all of the android models I can find, and the only one that seems to have actual android textures is Alice.

How to determine which textures models need, given the fact that models and textures that have no normal names (A00_2233.ascii, 1A1B5_dx10.dds etc) ?

That would be great to know, especially for scenery models where its really hard to determine which texture goes where.

I’m a complete rookie for exporting game models, but I have the files thanks to this community ! 

Problem is I don’t even understand how to do it   

I’d be very interested in getting map objects files. If anyone have successfully done it, you’d be awesome to share some tips about how to it. 

I just need little guidance on this   

Many thanks in advance

Do you converted files to ASCII & SMD?
Blender can succsessful import it.

Not yet, the problem is I’m lost when it comes to export. I mean I get the files list thanks to the tool, but the next step such as extracting specific files is unknown for me.

This step:
2. To extract a package, run with 1 parameter (package code)
Example: Detroit D0F

When I write Detroit D0F nothing seems to happen. Is there a specific command I’m missing?

When you enter the command (Detroit D0F), does the command window fill with plus signs and periods?  These are the symbols used to indicate the progress of the extraction.

Now I see it thanks! Issue was simply a wrong path (I was executing the command at idm file level, not in tool folder    

I am interested in getting map objects, but the file_list only mentions characters and cars? (198 lines to be precise)

Thanks to all of you I know how to extract. But my question was more oriented on how to do with objects that are not mentioned in the files_list, such as map objects

I think all objects, sound, and etc memory addresses are stored in list.txt. Use those, not detroit_file_list.txt. They're not named, so its a guess game, but I managed to find the police department object, the whole city, and some houses.


I suggest importing the list.txt into some database management program (or even excel maybe), and sort them by size, and maybe delete the ones that are already in the detroit_files_list.txt so you won't accidentally extract something you already have. (Characters are pretty big in size!!) Cheers.
Some memory addresses will return an error (unknown files), these are probably the sounds/videos etc, skip them.
I'd still be interested how to extract sound though.
EDIT: I think I found a test-map, it is at the '5' memory address

Wait is that a screen shot from the game or a render that you did? and when you say the PD object, you mean with all the models and textures associated with it?

It's a render I made. All the objects that you see in the render are inside that one file, textures as well. Only chairs and moveable objects are missing etc

I believe that file list is generated whenever you run the program without any paramteres. To quote daemon1:

> Reply from daemon1 ↑Sun Mar 03, 2019 8:02 pm at Sun Mar 03, 2019 8:02 pm

> 
1. To make a list, run the tool without parameters
Example: Detroit > list.txt
It will create a list of potentially extractable game packages and their sizes (in bytes). MOST of them will have models, but there will be some with only videos, sounds or animations, these will be skipped with error message "not supported". (list.txt, you need this)

A list of all noticable models is included (Detroit_File_List.txt)

Btw that render was made in Cinema4D with Octane.

BigFile_PS4.d04

General stuff and some early chapters are stored in the main big files, the rest together with the chapter data in the chunk big files. All the audio for a chapter (both SFX and music, excluding dialog) are grouped together as a singular audio bank using the Audiokinetic Wwise BNK format (http://wiki.xentax.com/index.php/Wwise_ ... nk_(*.bnk)). Extraction of the individual unnamed WEM files is pretty easy after that. I converted them to plain OGG using ww2ogg. 

Since they are unnamed I had to figure it all out by listening to the tracks, which was awful as you got 445 audio banks and 33000 audio files (this game is huge!). But since they are grouped by chapter listening to the biggest sized files usually gives you a quick indication which chapter this is and most of the music tracks for that chapter. Bitrate isn't the best sadly, but decent.

The game does index the banks and can address the WEM files by name as well, but I have only figured out how that works to 50% and didn't care enough to complete the research there. I was already finished making the compilation at that point lol.

If anyone wants to extract the banks for himself, ideally you have knowledge how Quantic Dream's IDM files and Data Containers work. If you do, the communicator type you are looking for is 1032 (CSNDBKDT). Since being stored in Data Containers, they might be segs compressed. Most of them aren't and the tools I write for myself automatically handle segs so I don't really know if there were any that were segs compressed lol

Otherwise the good old file scraping method should work too, just finding the file ending could sometimes be a bit tricky I guess (and you would miss any segs ones)

I end up with several files with several formats, as shown in the photo.

how to extract, the other files

with different formats

I can share the script quanticdream.bms It extracts the files

BigFile_PS4.d02

BigFile_PS4.d03

BigFile_PS4.d04

BigFile_PS4.d05

After for the files and formats, I do not know how the extracts

I found CSNDBKDT in the files like how Hamers suggested (by using ProGamers shared BMS script), now what?
Also there are animdata files as well

EDIT: ok so bnk extractor doesnt work on the CSNDBKDT files. Is there a way to make them work? There is also a QZIP thing at the beggining of the file. How to extract from that? I think thats the problem. The wav files I get are corrupted

I extracted the file with my Quanticdream.bms script
That I shared with you and that I managed to make it work perfectly
BigFile_PS4.d01
BigFile_PS4.d02
BigFile_PS4.d03
BigFile_PS4.d04
BigFile PS4.d05
BigFile_PS4.dep

I have access to all the files but I can not extract
Here are all the files I have access to

dc
qzi
seg
MS-DOS

I tried to extract them with Bank and the script but it does not work, I always look for a way to extract

I even used my quanticdream.bms script that I share with you to extract its files

BigFile_PS4.d01
BigFile_PS4.d02
BigFile_PS4.d03
BigFile_PS4.d04
BigFile PS4.d05
BigFile_PS4.dep

The same thing does not work with the files I mentioned

dc
qzi
seg
MS-DOS

I even edit his files with HxD


dc
qzi
seg
MS-DOS

Several numbers and several codes I'm always looking for a way to extract the files

dc
qzi
seg
MS-DOS

when I extracted the file with my Quanticdream.bms script
for
BigFile_PS4.d01
BigFile_PS4.d02
BigFile_PS4.d03
BigFile_PS4.d04
BigFile PS4.d05
BigFile_PS4.dep

Once the files are extracted there are 38 files in total in his files, there are many that I mentioned

dc
qzi
seg
MS-DOS
And the answer is how to extract them

How about next time post the ACTUAL link to the script by its ACTUAL author, in this case Luigi Auriemma.
Because when you gave that mega link seeing it was over 10mb it made no sense.
That way people can get the updated script, every time it gets updated, the one you included in that weird archive is outdated.
Why you claim it be yours, seriously?

Thank you very much that does not mean that it belongs to me. It does not belong to me, but after downloading it, I edited to make it work because it did not work

Quantic Dream.bms script does not work

And when I say my script it's my way of talking sorry if you misinterpret it

You should have mentioned that on ZENHAX so the author can solve the issue, and update the script, would have been the more ethical way to do, that way everything would be in one script where possible or another variation maybe, same way was made for Heavy Rain.

Wait is that a screen shot from the game or a render that you did? and when you say the PD object, you mean with all the models and textures associated with it?


It's a render I made. All the objects that you see in the render are inside that one file, textures as well. Only chairs and moveable objects are missing etc

Question do you know which file contains the objects and textures for the first mission? Also does it contain the scene(building) object?

also what do you mean by "the whole city" (do you mean an entire mesh of the city?)
also what file has the police department and its objects?

from first post of thread:
- Change detroit.ini with your paths. Choose only chapters you need to extract. Base BIGFILE will have all models, chapters will mostly have map objects, but also a few characters.
example:

```
G:\detroit\Detroit\BigFile_Chunk_1_PS4.idm
G:\detroit\Detroit\BigFile_Chunk_2_PS4.idm
G:\detroit\Detroit\BigFile_Chunk_3_PS4.idm
G:\detroit\Detroit\BigFile_Chunk_4_PS4.idm
G:\detroit\Detroit\BigFile_Chunk_5_PS4.idm
G:\detroit\Detroit\BigFile_Chunk_6_PS4.idm

```

- create .bat file in folder with tools
- write string 

```
Detroit	FCF	10887069 
```

to this .bat file
- run this .bat file
- profit!

Resources are likely the same or very marginally improved. Otherwise, it'd be nice for the simple matter of not having to be so hush hush with the files. Everyone can download them themselves.

I'm not so sure about that personally. The PS3 counterparts of Heavy Rain and Beyond: Two Souls were both researched down to the point of making fan-made PC ports before receiving C&Ds. Animations could very well be recoverable from Detroit.

Hey guys, i am new to this thread.

Just bought Heavy rain on epic store and was wondering if anyone could kindly send me the tool that works for HR via private message?

And would it be possible to have a repack tool so that we can have some fun modding QD games?

Thanks!

I think you're lucky. 
 I don't know if there are other tools for HR?  As far as I know, the BTS tool is able to export the HR game.

I have enough resources on this subject. But I must say that I have never used these tools to export HR. (It works at BTS.) And but I have to say that I don't know if it works from the PC version.

File:: [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Nrrgq5 ... zmEF_/view](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Nrrgq5LjvDF4NZkloAk55nHQE76zmEF_/view)  Now it's up to you to try them. 

[viewtopic.php?f=32&t=11411&hilit=Heavy+rain](https://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=32&t=11411&hilit=Heavy+rain) If you're looking for a vehicle here, I can't find it anywhere.  Please let me know if you find it.

Thank you for the collection! i will play it around to see if it works for the pc port.

I had BTS on PS3, not planning to buy it on PC except there is a big sale.

Hey y'all!

I've been watching this thread since it first started and it's great to see what came out of it.
I recently moved and didn't have Internet for a while and when DBH was released for PC I bought it, hoping there would be modding/extracting tools.

Seeing that there isn't any new content it doesn't really make sense to update the tools to work with the PC release.

I'm just playing around with Blender as a private hobby and also rip some models here and there for fun.
So, my question is: Could anyone help me finding the PS4 files of DBH? I'd really appreciate that.

Thanks and greetings!

EDIT: Got the files, thanks a lot!

Howdy! 

Been a bit of a lurker and only recently joined, but I've been watching this forum for a while. Sadly, I've noticed that there aren't any tools for the PC version, and while it would be more convenient for a LOT of people, let's be honest, it's nothing more than upgraded meshes and textures-though maybe we'd be able to extract more from it. Anyhow, I've been using Blender for about three years now as a hobby, but I've also got really into ripping games, and at this point you could say it's my work. 

I've got a huge thing for DBH, really: visuals are some of the best I've seen in years, and I would love to take a crack at making my own ports-and not resorting to downloading half-assed XNALara ports that you see all over deviantART (which is in of itself ironic considering the subject matter), so might I be PMed the files? It would be a great help for me! 

Thanks!

Nvm, did some more looking into the issues and it turns out that it's honestly what it is, which is annoying-i'm no node master, and I'm used to Unreal Engine and Unity ripping, so that's probably why I thought they were half-assed. Just a bit of mild frustration with not understanding what was going on, though I did notice that there were some maps for like the hair and stuff I didn't see that I think should be there, but since I've never actually gone into the files myself I wouldn't know. I do know, though, that stuff like specular maps don't exist from comments I've seen on this thread-which is kinda why I wanted to rip the PC version, it may provide us with better capability to do more research on maps and how they work if it hasn't been done already. 

Sorry for coming off like a bitch though, I'm cranky as hell in the morning

It's most likely a packed PBR texture nobody bothered to figure out. Not many games just flat out ship a specular map anymore, it's always packed or calculated from another texture. Or they just went full into metallic/roughness/detail mapping like everyone is doing.

I'm trying to see if I can write a bms script for BigFiles in a way that makes sense but Quantic doesn't make sense.

I can't be the only one who wants to start actually modding the game, and not just extract resources from it.
Surely there must be somebody around who is capable of making a unpacking/repacking tool?

The BigFiles aren't particularly complex, but no one really understands the format they used on PC yet.
Before we can do unpacking/repacking we have to figure out how these files are assembled.

Is the source available for this tool? Maybe we could modify it to support not just models, and to extract from the PC version.

PC Version is needed. Given that the PS4 files are not always complete, plus it would open the PC game up to modding.

I hope you can update your tool for animations and videos that would be really great

It's a game that is really worth it  

I really hope you can work on PC because I bought the game and I would absolutely like to
Exploit files

I still have all the PS4 37 GB files in the game I absolutely hope that you can update your tool For animations and videos and work on PC

That would be really happiness

I successfully generated a couple ascii models from the PC version with that new tool
When I tried opening the models on noesis it gave me back this error, yes I installed the plugin in the correct folder 

I can view models for simple assets like benches and stuff like that fine but any of the character models give me that error

That's an issue with the skeleton. Simple props don't have skels, characters do, so you get the error. For the ps4 version, you copy paste the skeleton inside the ascii to solve it. I don't know about PC though.

Hi. Firstly, I want to say thanks for the wonderful work you've done and are still doing with this tool. It helped me a lot, actually.
Secondly, I want to ask a kinda stupid question connected mostly not with the result but with the process of the tool's work. If we are able to make a list of the game packages, is it possible (not in the tool right now, just potentially) to replace the number of the package and get the model replaced in the game? Some videos of the mods made me think about it and I could not but ask.

I saw that, I copied the bones info into the model file in wordpad and it gave me this error instead

I just followed the instructions in this video

Animations tool. Works same on PC and PS4.

Usage:

1. run "detroit anim" 
This will extract all 24500 files with anims. Sorry no progress indication, this may take a few minutes.

2. reextract models with detroit.exe (as before)
This is needed, because tool will now create "nodes" file, which is needed for animation convertion,
also it will make a new model compatible with anims tool (different axis layout, origin position shifted)

3. run "detroit_anim [anim] [nodes]"
This will extract animation, applying it to selected nodes information. Technically, any animaiton may be played with any model. If some bones are not present in the model (nodes file), animation will still be extracted, but you will see warnings, and it may not play correctly. Absolute most animations will be ok, but some are not supported, there will be errors and warnings.

Ого, ты говоришь по Русски, удивительно) Я не могу понять с чего нужно начать?  Как открыть файл "Detroit_PC"  ? Он не открывается.. может есть видео инструкция, я просто новичок в этом, и только сегодня пришел в эту тему, раньше я вытаскивал модели только с помощью ninjaripper..
Если ты мог бы записать видеоинструкции, я бы мог пооблагодарить тебя донатом в 2000р. Если ты конечно принимаешь пожертвования.

since the skeleton is separate from model, you have to open ascii file with model in text editor, delete 1st line ("0"), and copypaste the whole ascii skeleton there

since the skeleton is separate from model, you have to open ascii file with model in text editor, delete 1st line ("0"), and copypaste the whole ascii skeleton there

thanks, finally figured it out
seems like wordpad was messing with the formatting or something but worked fine when I edited it in notepad++ for some reason

Also is there any way of knowing what texture belongs where?
seems like kind of a nightmare figuring all that out if I choose to batch export everything into one folder and all textures are named with a random jumble of numbers

Would you mind explaining what "XXX_tan.ascii" files for?
I can neither read them in Noesis,notepad++ nor import them into bleder. 
Just popping up the error messages  
It would be great if you could tell more.

Someone asked me if i can also get vertex tangents. I did export them into this file.
There was some noesis script to load them, but i don't remember how it worked.

Animation tool updated. 

Small fix for some idle anims, which have static bones. For example on the picture below fingers were incorrect (left). And now they are properly rotated (right).

Как твоя программа определяет размеры для текстур? Конкретно глядя на оригинальные.
Я к примеру вижу размеры в самой текстуре, но когда я их изменяю в файлах, твоя программа всё равно видит их размеры которые были до моих изменений.

В общем, вот к примеру размеры для текстуры. Если я их изменяю, по сути, твоя программа должна текстуру по другому доставать, но программа всё равно достает текстуру с тем размером, который был до моих изменений. Я просто хочу узнать, где я могу посмотреть эти размеры.

Animations tool. Works same on PC and PS4.

Usage:

1. run "detroit anim" 
This will extract all 24500 files with anims. Sorry no progress indication, this may take a few minutes.

2. reextract models with detroit.exe (as before)
This is needed, because tool will now create "nodes" file, which is needed for animation convertion,
also it will make a new model compatible with anims tool (different axis layout, origin position shifted)

3. run "detroit_anim [anim] [nodes]"
This will extract animation, applying it to selected nodes information. Technically, any animaiton may be played with any model. If some bones are not present in the model (nodes file), animation will still be extracted, but you will see warnings, and it may not play correctly. Absolute most animations will be ok, but some are not supported, there will be errors and warnings.

You have outdone yourself. My question is, does this work with the PC demo on Epic Games? I'm getting an error and wondering if that's the reason why.
Reason i want to use the demo is 1) I already paid for the game on PS4 and wouldn't want to buy it again on Epic games. 2) I only want the things from the first mission anyway. So that make it easier to sort through files it spits out because it doesn't have all the game files, only whats needed for first mission (or my theory is wrong).

Is there anywhere else I can download the tool? (ps4 version). The attatchment on the first page by daemon1 is not letting me download it. 
"download canceled: Virus detected" is what my browser says. 

I dont know if I want to risk turning off my firewall, but if there is a upload host I can download it from (meganz, googledrive, mediafire, etc...), that would be appreciated!

edit: For future reference, don't download the tool through chrome, but works fine on Firefox.

Your error is probably because you're using wrong parameters.

Thanks for the tools Daemon1!

The game uses multiple uv channels(for eyes,skin,cloth micro normals,etc).Can you modify the tools to extract them?

Хмм, в таком случае, если тебе не трудно конечно, мог бы сказать пожалуйста, как я могу найти эти текстуры допустим через hex editor? 
Они перекодированы или как? Ни одну dds текстуру не вижу, ехх

There are some models that could not be imported into blender and read by Noesis.
When I import it into blender, it will show me something like:Traceback...index out of range"
Here is a screenshot of my problem:



The updated tool extracts the models without giving the information "Unknow bones format 6" like the old tool.
In fact,  "Unknow bones format 6" usually indicates this model is a tree. Some of them can be read by Noesis but gives error when import them into blender  .

Here is a sample(2MB):
[https://mega.nz/file/S0tXHaQB#S6xvCKTvB ... l1s-uNNd6Q](https://mega.nz/file/S0tXHaQB#S6xvCKTvBogRyStGHCi_m8-wU1SV51-Dzl1s-uNNd6Q)

This sample might be Hank's house.
I do hope someone could help me figure it out.THX!!

This is because new tool now supports bone format 6, its used on PC for characters.
Trees use "bone" information to store additional UVs, which is not expected by the tool. So output files are not readable.
I didnt think anyone really need those trees, whats so special about them?

Haha,thanks for your reply!
I don't need these trees actually, i just want the map, house, environment,.etc. 
However, it  seems that the trees have blocked out my way on importing these objects  . 
The trees are existing in the map, which leads to the whole map unreadable.
I don't know wheather i've make myself clear

The tree can't block you from getting other objects.
Maybe you think this "bone format 6" is not only present in the trees? First you said it "usually indicates this model is a tree"

p.s. ok i checked the file, trees are blocking you indeed. I'll see what i can do.

detroit.exe D0F_553.nodes

is that the command?

EDIT: Nevermind

EDIT 2:

I tried detroit.exe [1A0.anim] [D0F_553.nodes]
detroit.exe 1A0.anim D0F_553.nodes
detroit.exe 1A0.anim D0F_553
detroit.exe 1A0 D0F_553

The last one gives me model not found. Others error out.

Thanks

So the output is .SMD
I ended up using a source engine plugin for smd.
But each animation i try to import looks like this and i get the error "SMD only supports 128 bones."

Thanks for the links, it was just a misread from me as I mentioned.

I’m not lazy, I have read all the 12 pages multiple times.

Video isn’t publicly accessible.

Thanks to all of you I know how to extract. But my question was more oriented on how to do with objects that are not mentioned in the files_list, such as map objects  


I think all objects, sound, and etc memory addresses are stored in list.txt. Use those, not detroit_file_list.txt. They're not named, so its a guess game, but I managed to find the police department object, the whole city, and some houses.


I suggest importing the list.txt into some database management program (or even excel maybe), and sort them by size, and maybe delete the ones that are already in the detroit_files_list.txt so you won't accidentally extract something you already have. (Characters are pretty big in size!!) Cheers.
Some memory addresses will return an error (unknown files), these are probably the sounds/videos etc, skip them.
I'd still be interested how to extract sound though.
EDIT: I think I found a test-map, it is at the '5' memory address

I wrote a batch script that makes it earlier for someone who is trying to rebuild a level.
This script will loop through a text file with all the memory address you want to extract and create a new folder and move the extracted model files and texture folder into that folder. The script is dependent on whether the model has a texture folder. Which most models do.

```
for /F "tokens=*" %%A in (files.txt) do call :process %%A

:process
SET _modelname=%~1
START /WAIT "" /D %mypath% detroit.exe %_modelname%
IF EXIST %mypath%\textures (mkdir %_modelname% & move textures %_modelname% & move %_modelname%_* %_modelname%)

```


This made my workflow alot better as i can extract everything i wanted and have them organized at once.

Memory Address List Example:
9
B
D
F
1D
1F

Actually, I've got the same problem with animations. It seems that if you simply try to import model and animation to blender it somehow places it wrong by itself or does sth else with the same result. I've tried to rotate the animation while importing, use different up axises but still got nothing but a broken model with some weird movements.
I thought the problem may be in scale because when I tried to import animation to 3ds Max it was shown as a very small bunch of bones (in 3ds it was sth like 100 times less than the model but it was placed and played correctly) 



 but when I tried to import animation while scaling it 100 hundred times I had nothing but the same result. This animation even tried to work (the clothes were moving as they shoud) but the model is still broken.

As you can see, this is a problem of 3dmax and/or its plugins. The animation itself is exported correctly. I can't help you with 3dmax because i'm not using it.

The animation is exported correctly, yes, though it can't be only 3dmax problem as it also seems to be wrong in Blender. Maybe I'm importing it in a wrong way there, I can't say for sure.
Thanks for the answer anyway. I guess I'll continue searching for an answer.

Yes, I saw it. Can you please tell then whether you modify some settings for correct import? I just want to understand whether I'm doing sth wrong or there's a problem with my software.

First import the animation into Blender Before confirming, check this box

Make New Armature

Import the animation you will have the skeleton Then import your model Select the rotation of the skeleton X -90 So that it is positioned on the model Make a CTRL A Once everything is selected, make a CTRL P and choose Armature Deform Now your model and well animated I hope to have helped you

Thanks, worked like a charm! I had to scale my animation skeleton 100 times before doing Armature Deform part and now everything finally is correct.

Still a no go for me. I'm not a animation guy so i'm completely clueless. Blender's horrific UI makes it impossible.
Can you post pics or make a vid. If there was a 3dmax version of this, it would be easy.

EDIT: So i have the scale correct for both the skeleton and model but when i play the animation it offsets to a different location.
EDIT 2: Okay got it to work.

Same thing. ww2ogg says No RIFF whenever I try to convert. I'm exporting from ps4 version, haven't tried PC yet.

Since I am having the same issue as you, I'm guessing the extracted .wem files are likely corrupted or have some encryption. Hamers seems to have successfully converted sound, but he did so with the .bnk files before daemon1 released the sound tool. 

The work daemon1 and hamers are doing is way above my skill level so take what I am saying with a grain of salt. 


But if anyone has the .bnk files or converted .ogg and wouldn't mind sharing, please pm me.

All extracted WEM files are fine, there's no corruption among them or encrypted either.
Open up your desired WEM file in any HEX software, and delete everything in beginning till you reach 52494646 (RIFF) which is the beginning of the header of the WEM audio, then save it and it will play/convert fine in foobar2000/vgmstream.

To automate/batch the process you could use VGMToolbox

Also when you open in HEX and see in beginning names like these:

```
X5002X_MAINMENU_LEAVING_PC_X02XANDWOM_LETGO_FRE
```

Means its the actual name of the file and last three letters, in this case being FRE is French, ITA is Italian, etc etc etc

Hi, would it be possible to add to the tool The possibility of having the names of the audio Because making 20,252 audio files of the voices in addition without name It is a little complicated to do it one by one


It would be super cool to have the names it would be easier thank you

Would it also be possible to add to the tool the possibility of extracting videos from Filming

It would be great

Also think a tool for placing names in the audio files would be helpful.

But for anyone that needs a tool for mass removing Detroit file attributes for .wem files, so they work with wem2ogg it's below. It does not change the file name. But if you have thousands of audio files it can save a lot of time.

THIS REMOVES ALL NAME ATTRIBUTES FROM FILES
KEEP A BACKUP

To use it, in windows powershell type

cd c:\<path_to_wem_audio_files>

Then

powershell -executionpolicy bypass -File c:\<path_to_script_file>\Converter.ps1

Hi, is there a way to convert all animations to smd I'm a little tired

I don't want to do them one by one 

Can anyone create a .bat file

or a script to convert to smd with the node file

I don't want to do 24,560 animations one by one 

It would help me a lot. I will be able to watch all the animations with Noesis.

Detroit_anim

with the anim

and the knot is going to be too long

It will be impossible for me to convert all the animations one by one It is too long

Hi possible to make a script to extract this BigFile_PC.dat file

I used the Quantic Dream script

Does not work on the PC version It is just for recovering sound effects and music 

I use grepWin-1.9.2_portable to convert qzi files 

For the Detroit demo

Then I used the tools to convert the sound

convert_all_bnk

BnkExtr

with CSNDBKDT

I just want a script for the extract on the PS4 version it works

It does not work on the PC version of the Demo

I give you the file and the script If you can make it work to be able to extract it Thank you

the Quantic Dream script is in the quickbms file

And here is the BigFile_PC.dat file that I want to extract

quickbms

Hi, is there a way to convert all animations to smd I'm a little tired

I don't want to do them one by one 

Can anyone create a .bat file

or a script to convert to smd with the node file

I don't want to do 24,560 animations one by one 

It would help me a lot. I will be able to watch all the animations with Noesis.

Detroit_anim

with the anim

and the knot is going to be too long

It will be impossible for me to convert all the animations one by one It is too long

```
for /F "tokens=*" %%A in (files.txt) do call :process %%A

:process
SET _modelname=%~1
START /WAIT "" /D %mypath% detroit.exe %_modelname%
IF EXIST %mypath%\textures (mkdir %_modelname% & move textures %_modelname% & move %_modelname%_* %_modelname%)

```


I created a script that does something similar to what i think you want.
Right now i'm trying to figure out how to convert the anim so i can import to UE4

files.txt is just the package number of the assets. There is a C# program i wrote (quicker than doing it in bats for me) that just strips the "detroit" and the file size texts from the list.txt
Bare in mind I believe this formatted file list is just for the Demo. I haven't touched this project in over 2 months so the details of what i did is fuzzy for me.

Thanks for these tools daemon1, they work really well!!
I saw that some _tan.ascii files have been dumped in my folder after extraction, I assume tangents data from the extracted mesh. Does anyone know how to load them into noesis?

Is it possible to extract just Eng sound wem? or maybe a tool to delete everything except a specific lang. 
With 74k files it's just a nightmare to find anything.

As I understand it, with a PC and a version from Epic Store you won’t be able to get SFX and music, but it can work with the Steam version.

I assume writing a script for the names of the voice lines would be impossibe if they aren't in the files somewhere already. But would it be possible to write a script to sort the sound files by languages? I've started sorting them manually, got to 6,274. It's devastating.

Here's a little rundown;

Wwise wem is used for the games dialogue.

bnk is used for sound effects, ambience, music etc.

Is that a problem or are you just saying?

Hey guys, I'm trying to extract the music/amb/sfx, so the .bnk files. Not the voices/wem's

I've read all the pages in this thread but none of that seemed helpful because it was too complicated. Can anyone please instruct me how to get the BNKs ? I'll take it from there, just need a nudge in the right direction

Using the PC/Steam version. Thanks a lot!

The trees are existing in the map, which leads to the whole map unreadable.
I don't know wheather i've make myself clear 

The tree can't block you from getting other objects.
Maybe you think this "bone format 6" is not only present in the trees? First you said it "usually indicates this model is a tree"

p.s. ok i checked the file, trees are blocking you indeed. I'll see what i can do.

So did you ever find out what was causing this? Or if it was fixed

Here is the individual script that can be used to scan the big files found in the game files to extract sound data.

Use the following attached script through QuickBMS and direct them to the big files.

Used to obtain voice lines dialogue.

If we do the same thing with the models, will the textures be named?

Somebody know how delete NON-russian and NON-english voice *.wem inside .d## files?
What do you mean with .d## files? From what I know you can paste this into a batch file and run it in the folder with the sound files:
for %%f in (*fre.wem, *ger.wem, *ita.wem, *mex.wem, *pol.wem, *por.wem, *spa.wem, *ara.wem, *bra.wem, *jpn.wem) do del %%f
I'm sure there's a way do delete everything that doesn't include *rus.wem and *eng.wem. But I did it that way.

Hi, I've put together a script to extract characters, but some oddities.

First, the textures appear to be reflected vertically. Extracting character 1EF (random cop), then running detroit_img.exe on 2BED8, the result is reflected vertically. "Police" is upside down but correct left-to-right.

Next, is there any mapping of texture offsets to the material that uses them? The ascii file has lines that start, "m_148CC", which looks very promising (if you extract _all_ models, many of those map to textures!) but then on a per-character basis, this material does not have an associated texture. :-/

Lastly, Detroit_FileList.txt. Did you make this by hand, or is there a way to generate a list of names for each character?

Could anyone please tell me how to apply the textures without doing it manually for each texture? I can get the model into Blender using the Lara plugin.

Who is interested in making a script for me to extract the engine files? I can push these visuals much further. Not saying models and textures and anims aren't important but this is as well. I am GamingDamned wish could change my name here. I am behind the RDR Enhancement project. I would be perfect guy to do this to this game. I have many years of experience. Not asking for much here and don't wanna sound needy or begging but i see potential in this game. Would be nice if someone helped here.

Hi
Would it be possible to extract all the videos from the game as it was already done for the animations and the audio it would be cool to extract them with the tool 

I hope it will be possible

I would very much like the tool to be able to extract them

daemon1 would it be possible to include this in the tool It would be great to extract the videos

I will be super happy to have the tools Thank you  

and also extract all the models These are the full games from Epic Game Store

I'd really like to see work being done on these games too, they are great. Is this a possibility? If tools can be made for them I would love to have access to them.

I made tools for Beyond Two Souls & Heavy Rain models long time ago. For PS3. Models are not changed on PC. I think sounds were not changed either. Use old tools.

Hi daemon 1 would it be possible to include the possibility of being able to extract videos with the tool i would like to extract all videos if possible

it was already done for the animations and the audio you could do it please

it lacks that the possibility of extracting the video of the game

I am interested to see this once extracted

it's a great game

it would be a shame not to include it while i'm super interested

Configuration visuals files like .ini or .dat or whatever format and data files and such controlling visuals. Has to have similar files like GTA has and other games. I doubt they would have it hard coded in the exe. Please check. Think extracting all files would be beneficial so I can do research for this game.

Would it be possible to extract the videos in the game files I can't help asking for no answer It would be cool to integrate it into the tool The animations and the voices were extracted why not the videos It would be really shame not to integrate it into the tool It is a game that must be really exploited

And then I would very much like to extract the videos

I sincerely hope that this will be integrated into the tool

Does anyone know the hex address of the character in [this post](https://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?p=161524#p161524)? I've extracted everything with a skeleton, and I can't find either the model in the link, nor the model in the original post.

I think there are significant differences in the models between the PS4 and the PC releases.

I have tried to refrain from posting this, but I cannot see any answer to this question.

Does anyone have any advice on how to import and view NON HUMAN meshes in noesis so I can export to fbx etc? I can export and view human meshes fine via the merging of the ascii files, but object meshes do not contain a skeleton ASCII file and noesis throws back traceback errors when attempting to view.

Also, while I am able to extract textures and convert a number of them to TGA, there does not seem to be a diffuse texture map 95% of the time. How are people acquiring the diffuse maps? I have attempted to extract these from photoshop by selecting/disabling certain channels like the alpha channel for example, but I never see a diffuse map.

I would like to be able to extract some of these models but I can't get anywhere without the above. Thank you!

I have no errors with non-human exports using Blender. Take model "1800", a CHICKEN FEED trailer. 1800_251.ascii is 8.5MB, and opens fine. (There are tangent files, _242 (a low-poly trailer?), and _245 as well.)

If export to fbx is the overall goal, this method seems to work.

May I ask what version of Blender you are using, and what plug in? I am able to import any ascii, xps and mesh etc from different sites but the DBH ascii files give me errors, such as traceback like in neosis.

EDIT: I do beg your pardon, I have tested that chicken house mesh and it imported fine. It must that some meshes are a bit strange and don't work? Any ideas on the textures and getting the diffuse?

Blender 2.79. I just chose the Chicken feed trailer completely at random. The character models need the _skel.ascii in place of the first line (the first line will be "0"). (Apparently those load fine in noesis.)

I did make one change to XNALara for Blender:

```
index 6e8e833..1fea08a 100644
--- a/material_creator.py
+++ b/material_creator.py
@@ -472,9 +472,9 @@ def makeNodesMaterial(xpsSettings, materialData, rootDir, mesh_da, meshInfo):
             node_tree.links.new(emissionNode.outputs['Emission'], shaderAddNode.inputs[0])
 
         print('Texture: {}'.format(imageFilepath))
-    print('Texture: {}'.format(imageFilepath))
+    #print('Texture: {}'.format(imageFilepath))
 
-    coordNode.location = diffuseImgNode.location + Vector((-1000, 0))
+    #coordNode.location = diffuseImgNode.location + Vector((-1000, 0))
 
     if bump1Image:
         node_tree.links.new(bump1Image.outputs['Color'], maskGroupNode.inputs[1])

```


There was some code that got duplicated or something. You should comment out those two lines. There were also errors about "coord[2]" not defined (or something?) but that was fixed by pulling the character skel file into the base ascii file:

```
 models/FFB_154_skel.ascii       1324 lines
 models/FFB_152_rigged.ascii   330667 lines

```

note, one less than the sum (remove the first line "0", insert _skel file, result is rigged character model).

Textures, no idea. They seem to be mirrored vertically for me, even. Unsure if that's a PS4 vs PC issue. I don't have files from PS4, and I think they're different. I'd like to get my hands on PS4 files.

The textures are a bit strange. There's probably a simple process I'm missing, but, after converting and getting the .tga files. The diffuse maps don't seem to be hiding anywhere within the channels. People in this thread have found them though, so hopefully they shed some light.

"Half of textures will have no extension. Again, like in B2S, those must be converted to TGA with another tool (detroit_img.exe). Use a batch to convert all files in one run (included)" 

There is no information regarding diffuse maps, and I explained above that I have already converted to TGA files.

Then you must have all diffuse maps there. I haven't seen a single model where diffuse maps are missing.

If you think something is missing, specify model id, and what do you think is missing there.

Well, maybe they are there. I'm aware that some textures from games require tweaking in photoshop via working with the alpha-channel etc, but I can't find any information about these steps here. There's one post that mentions flipping something but I need more information. 
I admit that on some meshes, and typically, the ones I am testing out now, there are some diffuse maps. But take D0F for example. If I remember, there are only diffuse for the hands and face. What steps am I taking to get diffuse for the jeans and jacket etc.

I apologise that I cannot find an example, but I will update when I find one.

EDIT: I'm not sure if I'm using Detroit_img correctly, but what I'm doing to get the TGA files is to simply activate the bat file.

You dont need any steps for these. They are originally DDS files, extracted as DDS.

@daemon1 So will you be able to patch the tool to extract every file including those examples I gave? I really like to tweak this game further.

Okay, I found a model example. Try detroit 746 - It is the deviant that smashes his head against the wall in the police station. I can't find the diffuse for his clothes, whether they are .dds or .tga (I believe they are tga but all I can find is what looks like rough maps. No editing around the channels works either) Could you confirm what their texture number is as it might be a case that my Photoshop is busted, or just confirm they are there so I can work out what's happening.

Edit: Another example is 12DE - which is a toolbox. Having looked at the .tga files (no .dds were exported), not all diffuse seem to be there. I have reinstalled Photoshop as well. Any advice? Huge thanks btw for the tools.

Okay, i did this many times, because some people think something is missing.
But i will do this one more last time.

for 746 jacket, here are all 22 textures used:

There is no mark in the shaders which of them which types, but these are the only ones used by the game, and they are all extracted properly.

Next i check the bench main mesh. Its using 3 textures:
400FD
400FE
400FF
Which means there's no normal texture for this part, and must not be.

I think thats enough.

@daemon1 So will you be able to patch the tool to extract every file including those examples I gave? I really like to tweak this game further.
as i remember, there are no such files in the game.
anyway, i dont have time for this now

Okay, I found a model example. Try detroit 746
...
1D28 - A bench - No normals for 2 of the 3 mesh parts.


I think thats enough.

Thank you for helping, but if all the maps that are used by the game are being extracted, then how do I establish what ones are the diffuse and how do I display them correctly in Photoshop or another editing software. That's what I'm asking for help with. There is no mention of this in your previous post, only confirmation that that mesh uses those textures.

It's clear that it is possible that diffuse maps are available by the other posters who have made excellent looking renders.

If no normals are used on a mesh then fair enough. But there is still a lack of clear information on obtaining useable diffuse maps.

If I'm being an idiot, then I apologize.

Surely, that kind of map is needed for most uses?

Anyway, thank you for the tools, they are very interesting. If anyone has any advice on obtaining available diffuse from meshes that have them, please make this thread aware.

Think someone could look into creating a QuickBMS script capable of extracting models/textures with their proper names? File names are stored in the BigFiles, as evidenced by the existing sound extraction scripts although I don't quite have the skills to work it out on my own.

Hi, it would be nice to update the tool to extract all the videos from the game,

for what to do the animations and the voices but not have the possibility of being able to extract all the videos

I have already asked several times but no answer

(and also it would be nice to also make a script for the models and the texture for the names

also do the same thing to extract all the animation I can no longer do them one by one)

I get tired of doing them one by one   

(I hope to have an answer now)

it would be a shame not to do this, the game should be explored 

I hope not to be forgotten for my requests 

I hope it can be done

only confirmation that that mesh uses those textures
Its also confirmation that those are the ONLY ones that are used. It means that whatever game is using to draw that mesh, must be inside of these textures

No. There are NO FILENAMES in big files. Wwise audio is storing their names inside of their files, this is why they are available.

No. In modern games diffuse maps are not like they were in old times. For example, in mortal kombat they are all just grey and painted according to masks with different colors by the shader in real time.

 but object meshes do not contain a skeleton ASCII file
I remember there was a problem with some rare meshes such as trees, they had uvs used instead of weights, and this resulted in incorrect output with weights, but no skeleton. I dont remember if i did anything to deal with it, but it was rare case, so maybe i delayed it for later.

Think someone could create a quick guide showing how to get roughness/glossiness maps from the extracted textures? Not all textures seem to have RMAs, which leads be to the conclusion that many properties are somehow calculated at runtime.

The normals were easy enough to understand, just flip the blue channel. Albedo was slightly harder, side characters have color while I presume main characters have it generated at runtime - colored textures for Kara/Markus/Connor could probably be colored manually, although I can say with 99% certainty that the game uses a mask texture that I haven't found yet. I've also seen a handful of unidentified B/W textures that look like they could be very extreme AO maps. That said, the main missing link here is still roughness and I can't figure out how to generate it accurately.

First import the animation into Blender Before confirming, check this box

Make New Armature

Import the animation you will have the skeleton Then import your model Select the rotation of the skeleton X -90 So that it is positioned on the model Make a CTRL A Once everything is selected, make a CTRL P and choose Armature Deform Now your model and well animated I hope to have helped you

Could someone please explain this a little further as my animation is not parenting to the character model after doing these steps in blender 2.79.
I am using the DOF model and an animation with 0 bone errors during anim conversion to smd.

I import the animation as a new armature > Rotate by 90 for correct standing position > Import ASCII model > I use A and not CTRL A as poster says "once everything is selected" so I assume he meant just A and Not CTRL A as there are no instructions for that combination > I press CTRL P and Amature Deform. 

The animation is not connected to the Model. 

P.S Thanks deamon for the insights!

Blender 2.79 has been obsolete for three years now - his instructions only work correctly with 2.80-2.83. Ctrl+A applies the transformation values, although you should have everything selected before doing so.

Using "A" to select everything is also most likely the root of the problem - you want the armature to be the active object, which you can do by first selecting the mesh then shift+clicking the armature. This can be done in the Outliner using 2.83, although it does work in the viewport with older versions.

Tldr; Follow his instructions exactly rather than second-guessing them, and for the love of god update your Blender.

I understand but if you made it where it extracts every file from game on all formats aswell. Then others like me can do research maybe be best. And other guy in here wants videos from game think be very good option. I know games has more files in those container files just probably needs to be sorted.

I have both older and the latest versions installed. It looked like they were being imported into the older, greyer looking versions. 

I try my best to follow instructions exactly, and these aren't exactly difficult but I have followed the instructions exactly in the latest versions and it is doing the exact same thing. I have everything selected, I hit CTRL A to apply the transforms, Then CTRL P and select Armature Deform. When I press play the animated .smd plays but the body mesh and skeleton don't move. 

Thank you for the extra help, but there's got to be a little step somewhere (that's more than likely something that is always done in this process that it's forgotten about) that I'm not doing. It seems the other guy had the same issue but he fixed it (though doesn't mention how).

Have you tried going into the modifiers tab for the mesh and making sure the "Armature" modifier is set to the animation's armature? That's what Ctrl+P is supposed to do, although it's worth a shot.

Hair animation with Wiggle Bone

To animate the hair select the smd points of the hair Check the box Wiggle Bone

Play the animation with animated hair 

I did it on my Blender 2.83.1 and it works perfectly

Simple.

1) Use Aluigi's Quick Bms.
2) Use scripts attached to this post, (Wem and BNK in one zip file) Direct quickbms to Detroit's .Big Files (Scan through each BIG file with both scripts)
3) Should extract the contents to a folder of your choosing.

QuickBMS can be found here: http://aluigi.altervista.org/quickbms.htm

Keep in Mind.

Bnk script is for games sfx, music, ambience etc.
Wem is for the games voice lines.

scripts.7z

thank you SO SO SO much!! < 333

Hi guys, 

I'm quite new to this and started out of curiousity but encountered a problem I can't seem to fix on my own. Maybe someone here would be so kind and assist? 

The files are extracted from a PC file btw, maybe that's the whole problem already?

So I extracted the files according to the tutorial, copied the .skel into the ascii and tried to import the .ascii but get this message from the XNALara addon. Does the addon not work with my version of blender (2.83 and other imports not done by me are fine) or did I miss anything vital?

Thank you in advance!

I would love to have an answer and
not be ignored

I just ask for the option to extract the video from the game, please do it for us

Same here mate. All I want is every file extracted and such. I know damn well game has more files. I understand if he wanted to mod just the set of files but rest of us wants everything moddable.

yes all files contain a lot of stuff Even if they are extracted with a QuanticDream script or some other script like big bnk files,
or bigfiles wem there are a lot of things in this game We only have the possibility to extract voices, also animations and no sound I'm talking about the music, not even renamed if we could extract them lol from the game the extracted files , are not even
renowned

like animations or voices Could not convert all animations and now we can't even get all videos

We can't even rip music to previously tested PS4 files

It's a shame to abandon this game after all the years we've waited   

Ask for help or information,

on the site it's really complicated, no answer

How many times have I asked on this site to be able to extract all the videos from the game files I hope it will be possible We still have hope

Finally, I hope

and also texture problem for the model

it's complicated to make the same textures for game models like Emma or Alice, I'm mostly talking about t-shirts that need to be retouched in Photoshop

when the tool extracts textures
It's a bit boring to retouch textures in Photoshop You have to fix the tool so that it extracts the textures from the model like the game and not to retouch the texture every time

One more thing, I hope that one day we can extract all the videos from the game with the tool

I also hope that we can go further and discover a lot of things in all the files of this game

I wanted to say one last thing,

we can't even extract the files

BigFile_Chunk_7_PS4.d01

BigFile_Chunk_7_PS4.d02

BigFile_Chunk_7_PS4.dat


BigFile_Chunk_7_PS4.dep

BigFile_Chunk_7_PS4.idm

Yes, it's true

Bro he works on whatever he wants, he doesn't owe you anything. Be grateful you already have some tools for models/animations at all in the first place.
If you really wanted that stuff you would already have started learning/trying to get it yourself instead of posting on that forum.

I understand but it would be nice to do it as soon as you have time

Anyway, newer games require higher firmware

You will share your tools for all the new games,
But we know very well that people don't want to share game files

Hope you can work on the tool for Detroit,
this game interests me more than other games I'm not the only one interested

You need to chill out, you can't just expect to be handed everything when you ask for it.

Hi. I will not answer
 I was just asking if you could send me or release the source code for your "Detroit.exe" since you weren't planning on returning to mod Detroit. I've built a free online modding tool for Detroit and I could REALLY use some of the code in your executable. I could credit you! A million thanks.

Replacing a custom model is much much harder than just export it.
In other words, if you're going to do that, you must be able to easily write such tool yourself.

I've written numerous tools but it's always based on other people's knowledge. Like how did you find out that every DATA_CONTAINER in IDX starts with "00 00 00 1D 00 00 00 01 00 00"? Did you disassemble the exe? Did you look at the RAW CPU instructions? Cheat Engine?

No, i didnt do anything of the above.
Also i have no idea what are you talking about when you mention DATA_CONTAINER and those bytes.

Interesting, so you tackled it in a completely different way? I learned to swap models from a dude who has a long history of knowing the internals of the quantic dream engine since Fahrenheit and Heavy Rain. He said every data container (in BigFile_PC.idx) starts with 00 00 00 1D 00 00 00 01 00 00 and every character catalog starts with 00 00 00 03 00 00 00 01 00 00. I ran a script that counted every DATA_CONTAINER and it generated 3,254 entries, the SAME number that your Detroit.exe  > list.txt command does. If your program doesn't count data containers, then what do you count?

Man of few words? Perhaps you are not understanding me, the command "Detroit.exe > list.txt" generates a list of all the data_containers with potentially extractable models. Your program does find every model listed in the idx file and the total count is the SAME as when I generate a list of all the data_containers with the prefix "00 00 00 1D 00 00 00 01 00 00." If your program doesn't look for "00 00 00 1D 00 00 00 01 00 00" then you must be looking for something else. Maybe somewhere in the BigFile_PC.dat? Whatever, it's obvious you don't wanna share... [sigh]

I'm not "looking" for anything. The method of looking for a sequence of bytes is bad way, and must only be used if nothing else is possible.

Maybe you're talented, and can catch this all quick, but I dont have time to explain the basics of data reversing, while there are lots of info about it.

Don't mind this guy, Ransack aka ProGamer aka (other alts) is a notorious troll, both here and on other platforms. He's petulant and obsessive, and if you don't satisfy his requests he will spam the same message over and over like a child. It's best to just ignore him.

I know the thread has kind of moved away from them, but I'm having trouble with textures. I can convert them, but every single .TGA has this weird sort of double-stretched effect on them that I'm not seeing others having issues with. Does anyone know if I should be opening/converting the files in a certain way? Many of them appear as pure black or just empty in most programs. Tried 2 versions of PS, GIMP, Paint.Net, and any .TGAs they do get open have the same stretched issue. Also tried Noesis to export and it gave the same weird stretched effect. Or am I just being an idiot who is missing something obvious, that's entirely a possibility.

Animations tool. Works same on PC and PS4.

Usage:

1. run "detroit anim" 
This will extract all 24500 files with anims. Sorry no progress indication, this may take a few minutes.

2. reextract models with detroit.exe (as before)
This is needed, because tool will now create "nodes" file, which is needed for animation convertion,
also it will make a new model compatible with anims tool (different axis layout, origin position shifted)

3. run "detroit_anim [anim] [nodes]"
This will extract animation, applying it to selected nodes information. Technically, any animaiton may be played with any model. If some bones are not present in the model (nodes file), animation will still be extracted, but you will see warnings, and it may not play correctly. Absolute most animations will be ok, but some are not supported, there will be errors and warnings.

hello, cant download this file, reload again please

Hi everyone!

Been trying to get a hang of how the textures in blender work and how the settings work best, failed miserably, and to export the models myself, import again. Let's just say I tried, but I'm at my wits end to be honest. Noobs shouldn't play with stuff they have no knowledge about. :'D
I see that now. 

I just wanted a good .xps model of Hank that's not all dark and funny looking and Amanda to play with but it's not working. 
(You wouldn't know where I can get those would you?)

Kudos to all of you who managed to do this! *thumbs up*

I can't help you with this unfortunately. Have you tried asking people on DeviantArt? Just a suggestion, cause I've seen lots of xps ports over there.

If your program doesn't count data containers, then what do you count?

Weird question. I don't count.

Hello again daemon1, I've now created my own model and texture extractor tool but found out that many textures are compressed segs chunks that, once decompressed, are either DXT1 or DXT5 headerless files.  How does your tool figure out the width or the flags in the DDS file? Clearly, you didn't figure out all of the data because many dds get extracted flipped upside-down. But I would still like to know what you got working

Why do you think i didn't figure out all of the data? I did, and its all extracts correctly.
Some textures are upside-down because they ARE meant to be that way. You probably don't understand how DDS works if you say something like this.

The width and the flags of textures are also present in files, its all set properly.

The information is NOT in the files, your tool is adding the DDS headers. I extracted the chunks myself and they start with QZIP! All I want to know is are you GUESSING the information based on texture data or are you getting it directly from the game.

I attached a screenshot of a texture entry in one of the BigFiles. The "QZIP.ETF_RAWL" header means "ENGINE_TEXTURE_FILE_RAW_LOD", the "segs" means it's compressed. Once you decompress the segs, you get a DXT1 or DXT5 texture with NO HEADER. Perhaps the texture information is contained between the "segs" and the "QZIP"?

Also, your tool doesn't extract all of the textures. It misses the LODs.

no, i'm not GUESSING the information. It is in the files. Or in the "game" if you like it better. Not in RAW data chunk. But in the same file. I dont know how to say it better.

It doesnt MISS the LODs. I intentionally SKIP them because they are not important.

Ok, thank you for that information. But where in that file? Going up, you'll just find other QZIP texture entries, and down as well. I searched all files for the strings "DXT1", "DXT5", or "ATI2". I found nothing.   

If those strings can't be found, then which bytes determine the DDS_PIXELFORMAT? w h e r e ?

The attached image shows a chunk deflated with Luigi's bms script, and on the right the same texture extracted with your tool, now with a header.

This is especially important for a game like Detroit which doesn't have such a massive modding community like GTA. I don't know much about Detroit but whenever n00bs ask I always help. I'm trying to add new features to my online mod tool. It's public already. [https://deadray.com/detroit/](https://deadray.com/detroit/)

Hi. I must have missed something reading, but I followed the instructions in the original post and read through all pages of the thread and couldn't figure out how to dump textures of models. I saw a few models with textures so I think it's possible? I dumped the model fine, but no textures.
EDIT: Yup, I did miss something. When the models are extracted, textures are dumped into the 'textures' subdirectory.

Hi guys. Aluigi just updated his quanticdream script to support the PC version of the game. I just tested it and is extracting all files from the game. I was looking to see if someone knows how to find the text. I wanted to see if it is going to be possible to make a translation of the game. Can someone help me out? I would really appreciate it!

1. run "detroit anim" 
This will extract all 24500 files with anims. Sorry no progress indication, this may take a few minutes.

Hey daemon, did you find Chloe's animations ?
Hard to find them in this huge list.

And it's the same with all the exe files in the zip file you gave in the attachment. PS: I want to extract 3D models from the PC version. Please HELP.

Hello!

I followed the instructions and I tried extracting the 'D0F' model from the PC version but I get the error "This app can't run on your PC."

In the command prompt I also get the error "Access is denied."

Does anyone have any idea why this might happen?

Thank you in advance!

Hi! I am writing a blender importer for your converted .ascii models.
I have a trouble on some data types of submeshes - faces indicies are incorrect. You can see this on attached image. My importer successefully worked on broken Daniel's model (1999_208.ascii), but with another file (1D3D_425.ascii) this happens, but onlu with some models (which have vertex normals data). So what is wrong with faces indices and how do I fix it?
Thanks for your work!

You could always just import the .mesh.ascii files into Blender using this script: [https://github.com/johnzero7/XNALaraMesh](https://github.com/johnzero7/XNALaraMesh) or reverse-engineer it's code for your own.

I don't know if you still need help.  Cmd is running in the wrong place. The tools is in a different location. Cannot find the cmd "ini" file.
Basically watch the tutorial video I made. 
Those who still have problems can take advantage of them.

For some reason, I was not able to run this script due to some errors. That's why I started to write my own version.

Hi,

possible to make a tool to extract only the animations of a model.

please daemon1

```

GAME_OBJECTS
GAME_OBJECTS SLAVE WOR
```

if you have the time to correct the textures and extract them without retouching them,

add it in your tool to

extract the same texture as in the game please

possible to also add it in your tool to extract the animations of a model not all the animations

I'm talking about adding it to your tool

Yes that's normal behavior, its a false positive and you can ignore it, many reversers protect their code with encryptions/obfuscations etc and anti-viruses do not like that, thus the warning.

Hi, can you update the tool for textures it doesn't work very well,

the textures of all models are not the same as in the game, they always need to be touched up please it would be easier to have all the same texture.
it is discolouring

textures of all models are 100% same as in the game

yes I know but why when I extract the textures we have to retouch them
I would have liked not to retouch them I even tested the Detroit tool, it's the same as your tools
it has problem on the texture even the color

(when I say it's not the same I mean the color problem)

I would have liked to extract all the textures with the same texture as the game without having yellow textures, and not every time to touch them up

it is super hard to make the same texture in Photoshop

"if you could just fix the texture problem and update it from your tool that would be super nice"

I forgot to ask you possible to add to your tool the possibility of extracting all the models of the game,
but with the eyes already on the model it will help me
I can't get away with Blender,
I have a problem
for the eyes in Blender

the textures are normal even the jacket is yellow not at all like the game we can see
even the Detroit tool has the same problem with the texture as your tool
it can be seen as the same on the photo that it is not the same color that's what I mean

it extract the right texture
but the colors have a problem

why then the textures are yellow and not the same color as the texture of the game that's what I mean
it can be the same texture but not the same color that we see that is the problem

they are the same color in your tool or in the Detroit tool that I have 

it's a shame that its texture is not the same color as the game

(impossible for me to have the same texture color in Photoshop (I speak like the game

I can't paint
the same color as the texture not possible if the tool extracts the wrong color

what is that "Detroit tool" you are talking about? isnt it just using my tools inside?

if you think something is wrong, what is exact model number, and texture number?

I tested your tool for textures which I convert with convert_img
detroit_img
I will give you the number you will see it has a problem with the texture even the color has a problem with the texture

(for Detroit Tools it is another tool

Model number 731

I don't want to be stubborn but you'll see that it's for all Models

Did you see the texture problem with your tool

Model number 731

Hi everyone! I'm fairly new to blender and working with the extracted models but I wanna advance a bit and was wondering if there is a way to extract the maps/ levels of the game, like say zen garden and other places from the game? I'm at loss where and what to look for. 
Thank you in advance and sorry if this is a dumb question.

What does it look like. What is the code of the model?
For reference, does the texture you are looking for have diffuse or any other texture?

Does anyone know how to get materials to load? the output file looks for materials called m_<number> but the textures are just <number>
I double this question. 
Its possible to figure textures designation for characters, weapons, vehicles etc etc but its a nightmare to assign 500+ textures into 1000+ submeshes from locations.
Is there any link between "m_number" Id and texture filename?

Also is there any difference in PC and PS4 filenames? Maybe PC version repack will provide proper texture names I dunno.

Is there any flags where I can choose where to save to from a converted file with the tool?

Any other flags?

I think this was asked previously if there was a numbering convention to match textures with meshes.

Hello, I was wondering if it would be possible for anyone to send me a list that only contains the codes from the Kamski mission (the mission where Conor is given the choice to shoot Chloe). I'm using the PC version and only have access to the big file, and would like to bulk extract the models from that chapter exclusively. Thanks in advance

Id suggest using "custom texture tool" from deadray website [https://deadray.com/detroit/files/Detro ... v0.1.1.zip](https://deadray.com/detroit/files/Detroit%20Tool%20v0.1.1.zip) (link is dead sometimes but try refreshing)
Just use search box to find whatever you need.
ARC_ ids are locations, ACC_ - props, CHA_ - characters etc etc
Once you know the ID (on my screenshot its 1B E5 (4 symbols after 00 00 00 1D 00 00 00 01 00 00) you can use tool from first post of this thread to get models and textures.

Open ascii model in text editor, delete this?

then paste skeleton data here?:


EDIT: it's working now i must have missed a space when pasting the skeleton into the model ascii, sorry for the confusion.

Stuck right at the beginning. I have an EGS version of the game. I specified the path to the idx file. I run the program "Detroit.exe list.txt" and get an error.

```
Unhandled Exception: System.FormatException: No recognizable digits could be found.
```

I want to get some levels of the game, I am not interested in animations or characters, is this possible with the tool from the first message? I'm about to say about the PC version.

Are messed up UVs a known issue? I stumbled upon this on Connor's eye mesh, someone said the issue had to do with mirrored UV maps. You can replicate this by extracting "D0F" (Connor's main model) and importing it into Blender and checking the UVs on his eyes.

Which model ID is this, D0F? I still can’t find that eye mesh anywhere, I’ll try another model when I get to my computer though.

I see that this post is still alive (more or less) and so I have a question for you, I have searched the whole internet, but I cannot find the game files on the ps4, only I can find its disk image (and I cannot I can unpack), if anyone sees this post, please share these files, I will even pay, if necessary, I will throw off my discord, twitter, all you need
(Я вижу, что этот пост все еще жив (более или менее), поэтому у меня есть вопрос к вам, я обыскал весь Интернет, но не могу найти файлы игры на ps4, только я могу найти образ его диска (и я не могу распаковать), если кто увидит этот пост, поделитесь пожалуйста этими файлами, даже заплачу, если надо, скину свой дискорд, твиттер, все что нужно)

Sorry to write here, this is important enough, this is a post so that you are not deceived about the PS4 version files by a person with the nickname Predator0000 (Developer#2317 Discord), do not trust this person, as you may lose your money
(most likely this post will be missed, and will not be considered as something important, but it is better to listen to this)
Report this person as a scam

You are absolutely right about this.

He will only try to deceive you. 
It has many usernames. But what he wants is always the same.  He is mostly interested in Detroit Become Human.

ADMIN, PLEASE DELETE.

As far as I can remember, there used to be a bms-script for Detroit wem files, but now it turned out to be lost.
Did anybody manage to save it somewhere?

There's a file "convert_img.bat", just drag&drop all the files that you want to convert into it.

> and someone knows why xnconverter cant read the tga files/ the tga files are just white dont show a picture?
That's because of the alpha channel, they need to inverted. Or you can try batch converting them to *.bmp format for fast use.

no, i'm not GUESSING the information. It is in the files. Or in the "game" if you like it better. Not in RAW data chunk. But in the same file. I dont know how to say it better.


Ok, thank you for that information. But where in that file? Going up, you'll just find other QZIP texture entries, and down as well. I searched all files for the strings "DXT1", "DXT5", or "ATI2". I found nothing.   

If those strings can't be found, then which bytes determine the DDS_PIXELFORMAT? w h e r e ?

The attached image shows a chunk deflated with Luigi's bms script, and on the right the same texture extracted with your tool, now with a header.
hello, its so late and I'm sorry for asking, but could I ask how did you decompress the files, cracked the segs? I'm stuck with bunch of qzi files.

first of all thank you so much for putting for time and efford into making this tool, from all the posts and screenshots i can see how efficent and awesome it is. and because Ive studied computer programming i can see how hard it must be to encrypt and decompress such files with this amount of data. I really appreciate the extracted files. however, when i want to use the tool it keeps saying the unhandled exception, out of memory exception. though I dont lack memory capacity in my computer. or atleast, I suppose I dont for this amount of data. could you be so kind and tell me what the problem could be? and how much memory is needed for running your tool? thank you again for your time. have a nice day.

its not about memory, must be something else, like using PS4 tool on PC files or vice versa

thank you so much for your help. I was able to extract the files and I really appreciate your work. Its really fascinating to study the codes and try to reverse engineer them. and your tool has helped me a lot with comparing and finding the connections.

Tried downloading the tool, both chrome and windows report 'detroit.exe' as containing a backdoor trojan (Win32/Bladabindi!ml)

If that's not intentional, perhaps cleaning up the tool is in order?

Can someone wiser help me to understand what this error refers to - 

"Unhandled Exception: System.ArgumentException: Empty path name is not legal.
   at System.IO.FileStream.Init(String path, FileMode mode, FileAccess access, Int32 rights, Boolean useRights, FileShare share, Int32 bufferSize, FileOptions options, SECURITY_ATTRIBUTES secAttrs, String msgPath, Boolean bFromProxy)

It does generate the list file, but that is all it does.  Perfectly legal  Steam version of game. Perhaps I have done a mistake somewhere in tool use, but not savvy enough to get on right track. 

Would appreciate any guidance. Unfortunately I am not very savvy with cmd and use of that and I apologise if my question is a silly one. English is not my 1st language I may have missed something obvious.

Hello I have a problem with the bsm scripts for PC PS4 does not work I wanted to extract them
if possible have a script for PS4
big files bnk
big files wem

```
       
       Can't read 260115 bytes from offset 000000007f4c985f.
       Anyway don't worry, it's possible that the BMS script has been written
       to exit in this way if it's reached the end of the archive so check it
       or contact its author or verify that all the files have been extracted.
       Please check the following coverage information to know if it's ok.

  coverage file 0 100% 2135828529 2135726175 . offset 000000007f4c985f

Hey y'all, I'm a complete "noob" at this type of stuff. I want to extract this room with all its debris from the Chapter "On The Run" when Markus is looking at graffiti. 
Moreso ideally, it would be a lot easier to just extract all the levels/maps along with their textures. If anyone could help it would be much appreciated.

It is a false positive, the executable is packed in a manner to protect its source code from de-compile/disassemble it, you will have to find a way to download it, besides removing the settings for real-time protection and allow the download the browser to download it, there shouldn't be any other issues to access it, you'll have to put it in to a folder and add that to a allowed location in your AV software so you can execute it freely, so it wont get deleted again.

Hello everyone. I don't want to create a new topic, but I just wrote another one unpacker (PC only).
It can extract audio, video, text, gfx, script files

Just launch app, choose game and output folders and press Extract
These folders will create in output folder after extraction:
audio_banks - .bnk - unpack it with [https://github.com/Vextil/Wwise-Unpacker](https://github.com/Vextil/Wwise-Unpacker)
localization - .ini - all text in all languages 
midi - .mid - found this just for fun
scaleform - .gfx, .swf, .dds - Scaleform GFX files, view code and contents with [https://github.com/jindrapetrik/jpexs-d ... r/releases](https://github.com/jindrapetrik/jpexs-decompiler/releases)
script_bank - .lua - some unnecessary files
scripts - .luac - compiled lua scripts, decompile it with [https://sourceforge.net/projects/unluac/files/](https://sourceforge.net/projects/unluac/files/)
video - .bk2 - all playable video, no green screen, play with [http://www.radgametools.com/bnkdown.htm](http://www.radgametools.com/bnkdown.htm)
voices - .wem - speech lines in all languages, convert it with ww2ogg

Hello. The Python plugin for Noesis doesn't seem to be working. When i try to open a model in it I receive a traceback error. Is there any other way to convert the files from ASCII to a 3d model file such as .FBX or .OBJ?

You should read the whole thread from the start. This issue got explained a few times already despite the empty line gimmick didn't get explained very well till later on.
You need to append the skeleton/armature data to the model file.

1) Open the _skel.ascii file with a text editor (preferably notepad++)
2) Once opened, select all and copy the whole content.
3) Open with notepad++ your model file which contain the meshes (usually the first one in the list and the biggest in size). It's .ascii aswell.
Ex: 83B_241.ascii

4) Locate the first line in the file where it say '0'. 
5) Delete the 0.
6) Now paste the armature info that you copied before.
7) Before saving, be sure to check that between the end of your armature data and the start of the mesh data there're no empty lines.
In short, between the stuff you just pasted and the starting of the mesh data there should be not any empty line. 

If u don't append the armature/skeleton data to the mesh & If u skip this last passage, noesis won't read sht nor blender.

Everything's working except that the texture filenames do not appear to correspond to what the model is looking for.

Using Connor's model from the OP as an example.

I'm using the XNALara Blender plugin and "file missing files" to locate the textures. It expects filenames such as "m_13414", however the extractor did not name them like this. All my texture files are named like "21C0F", for example.

I used a batchfile to rename all textures to append "m_" in front, but they still do not match anything the model is looking for. I do not have any texture corresponding to "13414".

Pretty sure I followed the instructions, but if anyone knows what I've skipped/missed, it would be appreciated. The only thing I can do for now is to manually add every single texture by hand, but I'm sure nobody else is doing that... right...?

this is not texture name, its material name. Thats why its called "M_..."

I see, thank you. I must need to assign every texture manually then.

Really appreciate these tools you create, daemon1, thank you for all your hard work!

(Edit: I am extremely impressed by everyone who is able to figure out which textures go where. I'm only plugging in the diffuses right now, but I cannot find which are the correct files for the eyebrows or hair, the triangles and armband UVs don't fit, and the jacket doesn't appear to have a straight diffuse at all. I can't imagine trying to do this with hundreds of textures for an entire environment...)

After a day of messing around I have made some progress applying textures, but it's a lot of guesswork. I still don't think I have the skin texture correct, and the LED is custom (couldn't find correct textures for it at all).

Is there a document anywhere that tells how Quantic packs their texture channels, so I can tell which channels to use for roughness/metal/etc? I've tried many combinations but it never looks quite right.

You should know just by looking, a roughness(or glossiness) looks different than a metal (or specular) or AO or SSS.
When I tested on a few random objects, I know they used multiple UV channels but I never tried the characters to see what was happening

I could try to help if you upload a few different samples as I don't have the game anymore

Yep, no doubt seasoned vets and industry professionals can tell at a glance, but Google's not been too helpful when I've looked for examples.

Anyway, I have figured some things out in the meantime, which may be useful for other noobs like me:

- [chachachat's posts on page 7](https://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?p=150058#p150058) are invaluable. Go read them.
- All those muddy yellow textures are normal maps, you need to invert all channels (especially the blue) to use them.
- For the skin texture, R = AO (in Blender, either ignore it or multiply it with the Diffuse into the Base colour), G = Roughness (invert channel), B = Metallic.
- For hair, use the pink-looking texture for Metal/Spec/Rough. Not sure which channels are which, but I've got mine as R = Metal, G = Spec, B = Rough. Could look better.
- Again for hair, get the alpha from the yellow texture with the black background. If the hair near the scalp gets black boxes around them, even though transparency is working, then you need to up your max transparent bounces value in the render settings.
- The eyes aren't included in the main model file. This tripped up [xactgd on page 36](https://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?p=178441#p178441), who thought they were editing the eye UVs, when in fact that's some weird flat thing masquerading as eyes. Delete that object and instead import the eyes from the smaller file that contains a bunch of scrunched-up mess at the origin point. For reference, the correct eye objects are two spheres buried underneath all that mess.
- For the eyes, you kinda need to edit the UVs to look something [like this](https://i.imgur.com/AjUCeLw.png), otherwise the iris is way too big.

[It's pretty decent now ](https://i.imgur.com/d9DWXFY.png)

All this is probably specific to Blender workflow, btw.

I used [this post](https://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?p=162335&hilit=batch#p162335) as a basis to write a batch script to copy the skeletons into the models. It's slow, it's a mess, and don't run it more than once on the same files, but it'll save some manual labor and let you quickly look through your extracted data with noesis to find what you want. Someone else who knows better about writing batch scripts can tidy it up if they want. 

[Get and run Blader's batch script first.](https://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?p=162335&hilit=batch#p162335) This is mandatory!

It works by creating a size-ordered list of files to determine which is the 'main' model file. Then it looks for a file with "_skel.ascii" in the name and combines the two. Tested and works locally.

-Place this in the same folder as Detroit.exe and run it after you already extracted some data and sorted it into folders with the other batch script
-Uses the same files.txt as Blader's script
-The combined file will be called like "(filename).ascii_withskel.ascii" because I'm not smart

LOUDER FOR THOSE IN THE BACK: USE THE OTHER BATCH SCRIPT FIRST, AND DON'T RUN THIS MORE THAN ONCE ON THE SAME FILES

```
setlocal EnableDelayedExpansion
set mypath=%cd%
for /f "tokens=*" %%A in (files.txt) do call :process %%A
del /f /q {temp}
exit /b
:process
SET _biggest=0
SET _skel=0
SET _modelname=%~1
IF EXIST "%mypath%\%_modelname%" (
echo processing !_modelname!
dir /b "%mypath%\%_modelname%" /o-s>{temp}
SET /p _biggest=<"{temp}"
FOR /f "tokens=*" %%F in ('find /i "_skel.ascii" {temp}') do (SET _skel=%%F)
IF EXIST "%mypath%\%_modelname%\!_skel!" (
(
FOR /f "tokens=* skip=1 usebackq" %%B in ("%mypath%\%_modelname%\!_biggest!") do @echo %%B
)>"%mypath%\%_modelname%\temp2.file"
copy "%mypath%\%_modelname%\!_skel!"+"%mypath%\%_modelname%\temp2.file" "%mypath%\!_modelname!\temp.file"
ren "%mypath%\!_modelname!\temp.file" "!_biggest!_withskel.ascii"
del /f /q "%mypath%\!_modelname!\temp2.file"
)
)

```

For models that don't load due to bad .ascii format (i.e. the trees in Hank's house map), here is a python script that fixes them.

```
sourceFile = open("FILENAME.ascii", "r")
filename = os.path.splitext(sourceFile.name)[0]
newfilename = "%s_fixed.txt" % filename
with open("%s" % newfilename, "w") as f:
  for x in sourceFile:
    line = x.split()
    if len(line) < 5:
      f.write(x)
  f.close()
```


The problem is that the .ascii files contain additional unexpected lines. By deleting these lines, the problematic trees can load, and so the map as a whole can load.

Here's an example of a file that Noesis couldn't load (D30_31.ascii) now able to be previewed:

Yes, no one complained, because there are no trojans or rootkits.
You seriously think that something can be wrong here, when after 5 years not a single person had any problems with it?

A lot of reversers/devs, protect their hard work code with a "scrambler/obfuscated" code so no one can steal that code or to see how certain things are done to execute that operation that extracts/converts data from... in this case games, and the executable not being also signed officially it will trigger most AV as a false positive, thus making some people afraid to try/use that executable, this is something known since the beginning, if you still in doubt, and only signed up here to spam and stir up non existent BS, you should not be here at all, or online all together for that matter, use common sense to figure things out, you'll have a better online experience over all

"code so no one can steal that code or to see how certain things are done to execute that operation that extracts/converts data from"
That has nothing to do with this issue.

"the executable not being also signed officially it will trigger most AV as a false positive"
Wrong. If what youre saying is true, then 99% of the binaries on github would throw false positives.

"this is something known since the beginning"
No where in this thread was this known since the beginning.

"you should not be here at all, or online all together for that matter, use common sense to figure things out, you'll have a better online experience over all"
 

You're arguing with someone who was asking why there are viruses detect in a tool downloadable for this thread. Jesus dude.

Even though I don't have to investigate or "justify" why those stupid AV tools do that, I know 2 possible reasons:
- some AV are just bad, and can do false positives for any sequence of bytes, even a .PNG icon as a resource inside EXE.
- some others cannot understand what my tool is doing, and because of that, they mark it as "trojan".

Greetings All, 

Recently i was working my way through the android models to extract a particular AP700 model and compiled a list for myself as i went and thought it and thought would be a good idea to share here. I think i was able to track down most of the android models in the game(as well as many humans and some props). Unfortunately my computer crashed while i was using the extractor and no longer wants to cooperate as of this posting. As a result i wasn't able to go through all of them and list all their proper model numbers (Some of the names were copied over from the file list that comes with the extraction tools.). Hope this proves useful

Exist there a list with buildings/ places?

I've been slowly filling out a spreadsheet of everything here. [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/ ... sp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fD59ymNWhL08Gekck0eejgedqDX-byXkHvrizR3AEbw/edit?usp=sharing)

There's a lot of placeholder descriptions rn, because for a lot of them I haven't checked their textures yet, and it can be pretty impossible to decypher what an object is supposed to be without its textures. But I plan on taking another run-through it at some point to tidy that up.

Everything below 0x17A0 has been checked and extracted, and I've been working upwards to fill in any gaps. If gaps exist below 17A0 it's because nothing could be extracted from those offsets.

Any help with regards to naming specific models or maps that I have no idea about would be very welcome!

detroit_img.exe sometimes randomly fails to convert a texture without throwing any error message. And i don't mean that if fails on some specific files, no, you can run the tool on the same file multiple times in a row, and sometimes it gets converted, and other times it doesn't.

Here's a script that will attempt to convert each texture file (in specified folder and all it's subfolders) until it is successfully converted or the maximum number of attempts is reached. Just change these paths and run:

> extractedDir = "D:\\Games\\Detroit\\tools\\extracted"
>
> converter = "D:\\Games\\Detroit\\tools\\detroit_img.exe"

```
import subprocess

extractedDir = "D:\\Games\\Detroit\\tools\\extracted"
converter = "D:\\Games\\Detroit\\tools\\detroit_img.exe"
extractAttempts = 20

def convertTextures(dirPath):
    dList = [ d for d in os.listdir(dirPath) if ( os.path.isdir( os.path.join(dirPath, d) ) ) ]
    for d in dList:
        subD = os.path.join(dirPath, d)
        convertTextures(subD)
    for f in os.listdir(dirPath):
        fPath = os.path.join(dirPath, f)
        if not ( os.path.isdir(fPath) ):
            if ( len( f.split(".") ) == 1 ):
                print( "Converting: {}".format(fPath) )
                counter = 0
                while True:
                    if ( counter > extractAttempts ):
                        print( "!!!\nUnable to convert file: {}\n!!!".format(fPath) )
                        break
                    subprocess.run([converter, fPath])
                    counter += 1
                    if ( os.path.exists(fPath + ".tga") ): break

convertTextures(extractedDir)

```

Hello, I know I'm showing up to the party super late, but can someone PM me the game files? Someone said the only way to get them is PMing here so I'd appreciate if someone could send them my way  thank you

Wdym? Are you asking someone to upload the game for you? That would be against several site rules, including #3 "We are not a warez site". It's not hard to find a torrent if you're too cheap or broke to buy the game.

Well I have the game, but I read that you have to have files that are already decrypted and that you have to get a link from someone in PM for the decrypted ones. If I'm wrong please do let me know, I have the PS4 version of the game and I'm just not sure where to go from here because it looked like I couldn't use the tool without having them like that. I'm new to the site (and it looks like its shutting down soon) and have some of the models in xps from others, but I want to learn how to get them myself and I'm not really sure where to start with that
