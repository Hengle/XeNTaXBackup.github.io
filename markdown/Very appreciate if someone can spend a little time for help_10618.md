 Thanks if you cna help.Ok.
I'm casually checking models from different games but I don't want to lose too much time on manually decoding them.

So I don't think I will "dive into" the animations of this game.
I will search for the rest of the body and maybe it's possible to code a simple exporter for the meshes.
(But I can't promiss anything.)

edit: well, not so impressive. Very low poly: [](http://www.pic-upload.de/view-20179198/PC18_upperBody.jpg.html)

Have another vkm model with - let's say - 200...500 kB?

This is a standalone exporter: 

 FungWan_Extractor.zip
(9.92 KiB) Downloaded 37 times


which creates wavfront obj from Fung Wan vkm.

Address of vertex count of submeshes has to be entered manually.
See accompanying txt file.
