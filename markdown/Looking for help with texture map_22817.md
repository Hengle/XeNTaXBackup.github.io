- Post Title: Looking for help with texture map

Hi,

I hope I'm posting in the right place.  If not let me know.

I dl'd some Last of Us 2 models from DA and I'm having a hard time figuring out how to apply these texture details.  I've attached the map in question. (had to shrink it down to attach)  It's suppose to be the stitching on the shirts and zipper teeth on the jacket.

I'm trying to do this in Blender, trying to teach myself Blender.  Hoping someone here with way more experience than me can offer some tips or point me to a tutorial on how to get these applied.

Thanks in advance.
