Mobius Final Fantasy has 4k texture pack, unfortunately the game only allow 4k computers to download the pack. However chrrox often puts links to directly download game files from their server.  So can anyone helps me to find mobius final final fantasy 4k textures link so that it can be directly downloaded  into computer? or change  the game files to make it download the 4k textures?
