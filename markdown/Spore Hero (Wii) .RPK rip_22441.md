I noticed that this game has NEVER been ripped and really wanted to get the world models from the game.  Is there a script to unpack these?

I'm not really sure, but RPK seems to be common file format for EA games
and it may use Refpack [http://wiki.niotso.org/RefPack](http://wiki.niotso.org/RefPack)
