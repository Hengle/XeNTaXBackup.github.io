Hi, i remember play this awesome game in my childhood, i wonder if i can take the 3D Models of this amazing game... 
The textures are fine, they're are in a .TXD format file. and can be open with "Magic.TXD" a software used for GTA, pretty strange uh? 

if you can help me, the only files i see in my CD are in .btW format...
