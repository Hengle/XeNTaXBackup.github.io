- Post Title: Looking for help to extract the file models of the Winx Fairy Guardians game

Sorry to bother but I saw some people here usually port 3d models and I feel bad asking but is very important to me because is related to one of my favourite games of all time, The Fairy Guardians which is related to one of my favourite series that I used to watch in my childhood, Winx Club and said game has some of the best well made models related to said series 
It was closed during a time before I got the chance but the creator says that the game will be open only for three days (june 18, june 19 and june 20) before being permanently closed forever [https://twitter.com/mattcrystal3/status ... z8lKMuAAAA](https://twitter.com/mattcrystal3/status/1667222401623441435?cxt=HHwWtoC2pZz8lKMuAAAA) 
I ask here because I lack of the ability to do it and many of you have a lot of experience when it comes to 3D models so it would be fine if someone could extract the models files of the main characters before is closed forever I don't care in what format I just want the models files so people like me would have the chance to export them to 3d programs such as mmd, xps, blender...
Here's some screenshots about what the models look like

-Bloom (casual outfit, charmix fairy form, enchantix fairy form and tynix fairy form)
-Stella (casual outfit, charmix fairy form and enchantix fairy form)
-Flora (casual outfit, charmix fairy form and enchantix fairy form)
-Tecna (enchantix fairy form)

Sounds to me you're one of those one-time posters came only to ask people to get things done for you. Then you gonna leave and never come back. That's a really bad impression for a newcomer. My advice, salvage whatever files you can find before the game shuts down, and learn to do things for yourself, if it really means that much to you. I'm sure the community will help as long as you show the right attitude to participate.

Listen, I wouldn't come here if I didn't need someone's help
But I need it, and not for causing trouble

The game oficially opened today and it will be open until june 20

I didn't think about learning before because I thought that the game was oficially dead and I was moving on when I saw that there was another chance but instantly regretting why I didn't try to learn before and now I have 3 days to see if someone can help me, I asked on websites like Deviantart, 4chan but people were always rude or not willing to help me so I'm willing to put my pride to a side by asking for help

Is the only winx game I care for and soon it will dissapear forever so that's why I need someone to help me as soon as possible

edit: well, seems it isn't even a link to the game. I read: "limited party event". Hopes are fading...

Man, I think, you have no idea HOW things works her. This forum is NOT a models providing service.
Requesters usually provide at least one model sample (or what they assume to be a model).

It all depends on how much efforts/time you're willing to invest:

I fear nobody will install roblox just to fulfill your needs.
