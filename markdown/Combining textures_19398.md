- Post Title: Combining textures

Hi, I need help combining these textures. 

They are from Dragon Ball the strongest warrior, an apk for android. I extracted the model fine with unity studio, but the textures are weird, like one has the drawings but it is blue, and the other one has the colors only. I´ll attach both png files; the blue texture is rgb565 and the other one is etc rgb4, in case that helps. The original file was a .u file, from which I exported the model + both textures. 
Í´ve got no idea how to proceed, would greatly appreciate any help.
Thank you in advance.

I´m going to attach one of the .u files that contains a model from the game, so that it´s easier for somebody to understand how the textures work. It is the model that has the previous two textures I attached. The file is a bundle, it has both the textures and the model. Also, there´s a .bytes file for every .u file, I can also upload that if needed.

Here´s the file:
