Are you certain the decompiler works? In my experience decompilers are by nature hit or miss.
I remember using one decompiler on a program I myself wrote and it outputted nearly 100 variables storing random numbers... when my program only used one and it only assigned it once... Now perhaps I used the decompiler wrong or something, but I was satisfied by that point, that they aren't so great...

Still, it could also be that the file you are looking at is either A: missing the header the computer is looking for, or B: has extra data that is where the header should be...

Do you have any way to determine that the file you have is one complete file, not a partial file or multiple files crammed together?

Are you certain the file you're looking at is a lua program, and not simply a file with the extension '.lua' or something?

Are you certain the version of the decompiler and the version of the program are compatible, if they are in fact programs?

Python 2.6 and 3.0 are not compatible languages, Lua may be the same.

Yeah, having had experience with lua I can say that the standard decompilers are very difficult to use. If you've got a LOT of tenacity and patience you can make a concerted attempt by following the link below. I've never had enough patience to do a whole lua file, but you might.
