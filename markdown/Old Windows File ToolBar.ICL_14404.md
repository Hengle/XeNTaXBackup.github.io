- Post Title: Old Windows File ToolBar.ICL

I am posting this here because I need help in getting this file.

I love the style of Windows 95/98, I grew up with it. And some time ago I came across this image:

[http://images.directoryofshareware.com/ ... 459630.gif](http://images.directoryofshareware.com/full/icon_extractor_2000_desktop_icons___cursors-459630.gif)

This image is of an Icon Extractor program which has scanned the "ToolBar.icl" file.

Does anybody have this file? I would very much like to have this file and extract the Icons from it in the old Windows 95/98 style.

A quick Google search shows that as being [Icon Extractor 2000](http://www.gregorybraun.com/IconEx.html) by Gregory Braun (note that the [screenshot](http://www.gregorybraun.com/IconEx_ss.html) on the site is identical to the one you linked to). Cheers!

Hey thanks I appreciate the help but I'm not looking for the extractor program, I need someone to upload the ToolBar.ICL file (this file is a computer system file which usually stores icons).

Aah, that would be my bad, then (I must've misread your post). Trying Google in that case doesn't show anything obviously helpful, but the thought occurs to me that you might be able to download a copy of Windows 95 or 98 and get the file from there, assuming it's a standard system file in one or both of those OSes. Failing that, I would be quite surprised to learn there are no skin packs for more recent versions of Windows that emulate the aesthetic of 95/98, including the icon styles; if you're willing to mess with that stuff, that's definitely a direction I'd look in.

Download and install this program: [http://www.gregorybraun.com/ToolBar.html](http://www.gregorybraun.com/ToolBar.html)
ToolBar.ICL is then in the program's directory.
