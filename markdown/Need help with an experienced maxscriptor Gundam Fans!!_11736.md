- Post Title: Need help with an experienced maxscriptor :Gundam Fans!!

Basically I myself can maxscript to a degree and have created some tools to import and export mesh to some games but have only been doing so for little under a year. I would like to finish a few projects for our server for a game called Universal Century Gundam Online and am looking for some private help.
