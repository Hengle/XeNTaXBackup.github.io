Can someone here tell me how to extract textures from G1T files in AoTWoF?
I have tried Steven Gas Machine to unpack them. But diffuse maps all I get is images with full color dots.
My PC is too weak to run the game, I can't rip textures by Ninja Ripper

File sample here

i have the script set to skip the tiny 4x4 textures because they are useless, there is 
still one format that i don't know what it is (0x5f) but at least the errors are gone, so
if you see a scrambled texture just ignore it for now.

Hello AceWell

Can you talk a look at this sample G1T and create a script to extract it

i need more than one sample to make a script.   
also what game and platform is that sample from?
the header is big-endian and the texture data is swizzled,
if this is different game best to make a new thread.
