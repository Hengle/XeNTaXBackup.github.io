Yep double encryption used for files with extensions *.LUA , *.XET, *.TET *.FX.. Algo SEED in CBC mode + SWAP + XOR. Anyway i update script. Supported decrypting LUA and ect. files. Some files can not be decompressed because windowBits -15. Use > offzip -z -15 -a. I temporary set unzip_dynamic and dunno how avoid it

Here is a tool for decompress .x files. 

[https://code.google.com/p/sirius-lighti ... tWindow.7z](https://code.google.com/p/sirius-lighting/downloads/detail?name=MeshConvertWindow.7z)

Select "Convert to x.binary"
