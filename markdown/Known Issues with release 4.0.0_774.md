- Post Title: Known Issues with release 4.0.0

A list of bugs reported on 4.0.0, if it's here, you can bet it will be fixed in the future. 

1. Adding files in MultiEx Commander to Painkiller *.PAK files screws up the filenames of those files that were already in there and come AFTER the newly inserted ones. This only happens when you add more than 1 file simultaneously to the archive. I will take a look at the damn Add routine in painkiller.dll. FIXED -> Get the latest download!

2. Creating a new Painkiller .PAK file from scratch may take a while if there are a lot of files to add. Just have patience.

3. No BASS.DLL installed? FIXED ->  Get the latest download!
