- Post Title: The Music of Comanche MAC

Hello everyone, I have an issue here I might like a little bit of input/help on:

I'm trying to get the music of Novalogic's Comanche MAC (the 1994 port of Comanche: Maximum Overkill, released in '92) into a generally useable format for any modern computer. Obviously, that means the audio files need to be converted.

Interestingly, QuickTime on the Macintosh (a modern iMac running OSX) will read and play the files, even though no file extension is present in the file name. Windows QuickTime WILL NOT do the same thing. This leads me to believe that these are Macintosh-naitive MIDI files, for which the Mac version of QuickTime has legacy codecs; Windows computers thus do not.

...Or this assumption could be incorrect. Regardless, if someone here has (a.) a Mac and (b.) the full version of QuickTime for the Mac, the files could easily be converted without loss. This would be the easy way out.

Otherwise, I do believe I've found a general solution for this issue, as can be seen on this board:

However, I would like a bit more closure on this matter, for the mere purpose of understanding what kind of files these are. As such, you'd probably like to see the files:

The MIDI music is much, much better on the Mac version than the DOS version (it's easy enough to see and hear the latter in action on YouTube). I was told the Windows version has more sound files in its directory, but I have to assume these are SFX files; The Mac SFX files are contained in a separate, closed directory on the Comanche MAC disk.

In any sense, thank you for your time.
