woops, just realized the image didn't display. Put up a new one, if anyone's interested...

And um, even through I do want to use the models, I would have taken a jab at the file format myself if I knew anything about how to do it.
tbh, if someone could just give me a hint or whatever towards figuring out that I'd try it by myself, but I don't know how to start.

I opened up the models in HxD for mere curiosity, and the texture filepaths are laid there flat, so it's not compressed... I just dunno where the vertex, mesh, etc data is stored because I'm a dumb noob.

I hope this clarified the fact that while I want to use the models, I'm not just asking you guys a full converter, just, how should I go to get those viewable in a 3D renderer? I've searched a bit about Tasofro's other 3D game as well, and the only model rip from those was made using 3D Ripper DX... And my computer can't run the game because it sucks, so I wanted to get them from the source...

I'll look into adding a Sanae plugin for this.

Doesn't look too complicated, compared to Touhou Kobuto anyways
