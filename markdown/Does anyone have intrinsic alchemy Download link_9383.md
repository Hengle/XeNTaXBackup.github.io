You don't need it as chroxx said. Even if you get it, you will be extremely disappointed lol. It only opens maybe one or two models out of more than a 100 and it doesn't play or allow you to export animations or anything (the leaked version is like an older, pre-Project Diva release, it is useless). The only thing it is good for, is if you want to see what the scene graph nodes are named. Other than that, it is totally useless. The only thing you can do at the moment, is use JCSCP, rig and animate yourself.
