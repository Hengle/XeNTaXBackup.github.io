- Post Title: Blood Bowl - Chaos Edition

Hey all!

I am having some issues getting .nif files from Blood Bowl into .obj format.  I can get the file, but its all in standard poses, t pose basically.  I am able to export the entire model, or a single mesh at a time.   My ultimate goal is to get a model into a pose using the .kf associated file, into an object file.

I'm using NifSkope right now, and man if it only had a .stl export function, lol.  My initial attempt was to use blender, with the nif plug in.  As I am coming to learn, that plug in only works with specific games.  Blood Bowl not being one of them, it is supplying an error when I attempt to import the nif.

Any suggestions?
