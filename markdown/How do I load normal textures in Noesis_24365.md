- Post Title: How do I load normal textures in Noesis?

I've got an Unreal 4 model converted to PSK format, among others, fully diffuse textured and displaying in Noesis. However, the model has normal and ambient occlusion textures in the same folder, and I can't seem to get Noesis to apply them to the model as well. I tried renaming them to the corresponding diffuse texture's filename but with _n and _o at the end, and then _normal, but to no avail. Noesis autoloads diffuse textures in the same folder if they have the right filename, so what do I have to do to make it autoload normals and AO maps like that? Or is Noesis just currently incapable of such a thing?
