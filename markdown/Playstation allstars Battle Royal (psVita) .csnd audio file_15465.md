- Post Title: Playstation allstars Battle Royal (psVita) .csnd audio file

Alright so ive been searching for about 2 days combined looking for a way to at least listen too or convert to a Wav format (since its the most widely used).
So far ive seen 3ds homebrew app makers mention it and from what ive seen i think its some form of looping sound the 3ds uses and a really old format a program called "DirectSound/DirectMusic" used to use back in like 2007 or 06. its no longer supported so i cant find a way to open the sound file and no real alternative programs exist so ic an just listen to them.

The files in question are sounds i suspect to be character grunts for moves or when they take damage and the like.
ive been asking around some vita modders thinking it was a familiar format within Vita games but apparently not, they dont have a clue what the format is and nobody has really dumped ALL of this games content before so finding anyone who has done anything with most files within the .psarc files (thats where the .csnd files came from) is very scarce. 

Does anybody know anything about RIFF and/or WAVE format conversion? The hex says its a RIFF and WAVE and that the format is usually used to store data packets for sound.
