Closer analyzation.

definitely graphic files. possibly not even compressed so hard,
if at all. could even be some kind of a modified DirectX texture.

i think the only thing we need is an viewer for this graphictype....
i have a feeling its not really that hard to find .....

maybe......

I wanted to make a viewer sadly I have no programming experience I did make a gui in Visual C# though I bought a book on C# today on amazon so I can learn a few things then experiment.

Ok, the dowload has all the files within the zpackage execpt levels. I only tossed in two levels- an mp and sp map, because of size.

Edit: The files don't seem to be compressed at all. Now all we need is an editor.

The images are DXT (1 &3) I believe I did the .rba some time ago, the .rbm I never really looked at.
