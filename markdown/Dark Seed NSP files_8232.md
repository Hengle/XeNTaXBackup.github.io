- Post Title: Dark Seed NSP files

Simple enough, these are obviously graphics files...but I need the method of opening them properly. I messed around in TiedGGD and Tile Molester with 'GPLAYER.NSP' and it was plain as day that they contain the graphics.

Can anyone help? I'm working on a project for a friend that needs the sprites of the protagonist...which are in 'GPLAYER.NSP'.
