- Post Title: Lego Batman 2: DC Superheroes

Anyone know about modding Lego games (specifically Lego Batman 2)? When I was younger I amassed hundred of hours into this game, and I feel the 3rd Lego Batman hasn't done it nearly enough justice. I have been contemplating making several mods for this game to give it the proper sequel it deserved. The two main mods I have been contemplating are the following: 
         1.) Make a mod that adds on to the story, tying up all the loose ends they left drifting about, i.e, what happened to the goons running around Gotham at the end of the game?

         2.) Create a mod that adds more puzzles in the open world aspect of the game, giving players ample opportunity to enjoy themselves exploring Gotham. 

I have not been able to locate their game engine, the "Gotham variant", and I dont suppose anyone has any Ideas on how all this would be accomplished? Any help would be greatly appreciated!
