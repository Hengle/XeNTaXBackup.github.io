Hey all, I am having trouble with Crackdown and their XWB files. I have tried using unxwb, and I get zero results. Is it because it is 360 game? instead of OG-Xbox?

I have attached the file I was trying to extract, if anyone could help or tell me what to do, that'd be great.

Hey, try using this app: [http://www.xbox-hq.com/html/modules.php ... kszBox-ABX](http://www.xbox-hq.com/html/modules.php?name=Xbox_Homebrew&op=view&gid=366&title=EkszBox-ABX)
It's mainly for OG Xbox .xwb's, but it helped me extract Perfect Dark Zero .xwb's, so give it a try!

It worked!, now I have a bunch of XMA's that I can't convert
