i found this file in the game, it is a pac file with txt in it, is there any tutorial for a beginner like me to edit this file without knowing anything about hex?
(I use Google translate).
Here is the file link

While tricky without programming knowledge, minor text tweaks and using the right tools can help ease into PAC file hacking

Unfortunately I do not have enough context to provide specific advice on how to edit that .pac file. PAC files are a proprietary archive format used by some games to store game assets like textures, models, etc. 

However, here are some general tips for editing PAC files as a beginner:geometry dash

- Look for PAC editing tools/viewers for the specific game. Some games have dedicated editors that can unpack and allow editing of PAC files.

- Try a general purpose PAC extraction tool like PacExtractor to unpack the contents first. This lets you look at the files inside.

- For text/config files, use a regular text editor like Notepad++ after unpacking. But don't edit binary files like textures.

- Use a hex editor like HxD if you need to make small edits to specific bytes in binary files. But this requires knowing the file format.

- For larger mods, look into PAC repacking tools to rebuild the PAC after editing contents.

- Check game modding communities for that game for advice on PAC editing workflows.

- Make backups and work cautiously to avoid damaging the PAC contents.

Overall for a beginner, I'd recommend trying to find game-specific PAC editing tools first, or unpacking the PAC and only editing the text/config files you understand initially. Hex editing takes more knowledge of the binary file formats. Start small and back up files as you learn.

Thank you, I searched on google and didn't see any community talking about txt file problem in pac file, the amount of text is huge if I didn't have this game's pac file decompression and compression tool I wouldn't have can be localized, maybe I should give up.
