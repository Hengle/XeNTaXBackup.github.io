- Post Title: Translating text in a launcher?

What kind of methods are used to translate a game client's text stored in an exe file?
Like suppose it were some standard window with some standard buttons and drop-down menus and stuff all in a PE file.

Resource hacker is one way, but what other methods are available?

Well, hex editor?!

But you can try also Radialix.

With hex editor, I can't really do much with the strings.

Each string is allocated a specific block of space in the exe right? So if I wanted to write arbitrary strings into it I'd have to recompile the exe or something.

Radialix looks pretty cool, though is it any different from what reshacker provides?
