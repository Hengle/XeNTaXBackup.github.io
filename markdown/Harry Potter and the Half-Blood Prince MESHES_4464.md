Hey
I wanna extract all the meshes from this game, but its really hard because i cant find any information about the ffs files on the whole internet.
I think an ffs file contains meshes, not just one, like an extracted library, the only problem is, i cant unextract... Yes, i've tried everything, please dont leave me with a "search for it on google". I've opened them in wordpad and found these:

(a bunch of unreadable code, then:)
...\PC\Neutral\Chapters\Hogwarts\Zones\ZONE_HW_Grand_Staircase_Lower_DD\Models\GEOMETRY_HW_Grand_Staircase_Lower_DD.fpm \PC\Neutral\Chapters\Hogwarts\Zones\ZONE_HW_Grand_Staircase_Lower_DD\Models\WP_ARC_staircase_LOD_3.fpm \PC\Neutral\Chapters\Hogwarts\Zones\ZONE_HW_Grand_Staircase_Lower_DD\Models\WP_ARC_Stone_Plaque.fpm.. etc (and many more)

then again another bunch of unreadable cr*p..

If somebody can, please help!

and sorry for the wrong use of english, i'm from hungary

ffs files?
Dont you mean For F(...) Sake files? lol
j/k

The Harry Potter series games are from EA?
I though they always uses .bin formats like all previous
NFS games.
Most bin formats contains meshes and probably textures too.

Order of the Phoenix and the Half-Blood Prince uses .big files. And inside of these are folders. And inside of those can find some .sdt , .shd , .str , and .ffs  files when somebody opens it in the program called finalbig. Checked all of these in wordpad, and only the .ffs format contains models.
