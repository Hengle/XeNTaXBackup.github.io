Anyone get a chance to look at the textures for this game? It uses some weird compression scheme. Wow, Luigi's site was suspended huh? Man, a lot of crazy things are happening the last few days; the TR forums are up in arms and luigi's site is now suspended lol. The world's about to end huh ?

yeah use ever aluigi.org, indeed I never write aluigi.altervista.org in my documents/website/tools or on the forums just because I pay a domain and it's good to grant ever the accessibility of the website.

anyway the problem on aluigi.altervista.org is temporary, it's happening from about 2 weeks but you didn't notice because it was only some minutes long... very annoying.

Hi

By trying to change text in the game,i stuck. Somewhere in hex code must be data about file size.

What values are responsible for that kind of data. Cause after changing text, file size is changed. So the game not working.

Need advice, thanks

You can look at the script to see where the size is stored (both the compressed and original).

all that i learned from script, is that the 0x10 is file size, but i can't understand for what purpose this value needed.

i just want learn on how to modify file properly, so please, what values in hex must be edited.
However, there are two values, that stores data about size or something like that. First is at 0xE. Second one is at 0xF. What data they contains - mistery for me  

need help
