- Post Title: Extract and play Borderlands sounds?

Anyone know if it's possible to extract and play Borderlands sounds? If so, what do I need to do? I just want to extract and play the sound effects from the game. Thanks.

they are .ogg (soundnodewave is the default extension in ut3 engine i think) in upk files. you can use gildors extract.exe on a upk file, then look at the extracted contents for soundnodewave files, which are actually .ogg
