- Post Title: Export model formats using python

I've written some scripts in python that parse 3D objects into my own specified data structures and then use those to export to common formats like obj. This is mainly for batch processing.

So I have the export functionality, and figured I should put it to the test by importing some models.
The plan is to use max import scripts as reference (which is pretty much just re-writing it in python).

I don't know much about the math or the technical details behind all of these numbers, nor do I want to figure out how they work ATM since that would take awhile.

Are there a set of functions that are absolutely necessary in order to successfully transliterate the max scripts to python?
