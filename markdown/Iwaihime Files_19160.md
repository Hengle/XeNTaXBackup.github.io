- Post Title: Iwaihime Files

So as of recent i have been trying to get the files out of the Iwaihime data packs. 
Most of the files i have been able to unpack are the .cpk files since their Criware pack files, then having run into a bit of a problem with the System files.
All of the files are missing their extensions, but with the help of the arc_Extractor i have been able to unpack the images and the sounds, since they are .HCA for sounds and .XTX for images/textures/fonts 

Im still missing the Script files/text for the games and the system files (sys.cpk) when extracted from the .cpk file are compressed files, we can find some of them are .xtx and some are .hca sound files but the code is different from the existing files in those same formats with the headers being super different and encoded differently. I need help figuring out how to decompress these so i can get to the files inside of them. 
Im almost positive these files contain the UI/Menu sound effects as well as the UI textures itself. i just need to get inside and get the files out. 

HEres a box link to those system files, including the sys.cpk just incase they need to be re-extracted.

There are also three other files in the data folder that have extensions i don't recognize/can't utilize 
these are 000.drt 001.drt & sn.bin

I haven't the foggiest clue what's inside the .drt file but the .bin files most likely contain the script files and such which is what i also need. 
i'll leave a link here for those files as well.
