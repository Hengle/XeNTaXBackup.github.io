- Post Title: how to convert folder to .ehp

Hello there, I've been trying to change this Yu-Gi-Oh graphics for a while and everything went perfectly until I encounter this problem.

Basically, I managed to convert a .ehp and extracted all of it's .gim to obtain which graphics i needed to edit. Once I did that, I don't know how to archive/pack all of these .gim into one .ehp file again.
