- Post Title: Project Diva Extend alchemy help

Hi guys, I'm trying to rip Project Diva Extend Rolling girl Miku but Im having problem. I followed this step but only thing I manage to get is the head etc. but not the costume parts.

I tried extracting and ended up crashing when I tried to open bodyshape.igb(Possible Costume file). Only thing I manage to rip was textures. Does anyone know how to extract the igb file models from Alchemy? If so, please help me. Thanks
