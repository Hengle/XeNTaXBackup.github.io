- Post Title: "crypted" gr2 file?

Hello, i've found this crypted gr2 models, the encryption does not look very complicated as i checked with a hex tool
, i think there are only some values changed so the viewer don't read them
i attached in here the models with the viewer and some examples of non crypted models
i wish i can find help here  thanks
