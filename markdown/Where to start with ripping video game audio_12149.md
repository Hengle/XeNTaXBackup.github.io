- Post Title: Where to start with ripping video game audio?

I'm interested in pretty much all systems, but at the moment I'm more interested in GBA, PS3, Xbox360, and PC ripping. Where do I start?

Well, for the start, most traditional:

This type of sound/music you can find up to ~6 generation era (mostly up to 5 generation) of consoles or handhelds.

In 5 and 6 generations this can be randomly mixed together with:

So, firstly you need to understand the main difference between "stream/CD-DA/wav" music/sound and "tracker music". And here is some tutorials (also for some consoles you need to read official SDK about very specific audio format, which can be used by developers):

You can google more or find some info on xentax wiki. PS3 and Xbox360 usually splits to game engine type, like "ripping UE3 audio" and similar stuff.
