the wolfenstein from pc uses .pk3 and are about 5 mb, the .cache maps for xbox are about 25 mb, if i provide you with a sample could you make multix compatible with .cachemap for wolfensten xbox?

Yep, sure can. The files are too big to be posted here, so perhaps you can use this tool to cut the archives for us. The program will give us the bits that we need in the archive and zip them up, so just post the zip on the forums or to our email address.

You can download the cutter from [http://www.watto.org/extract/download/cutter.zip](http://www.watto.org/extract/download/cutter.zip) . You will need to have Java installed - you already have Java if you use Game Extractor.

Thanks mate.

Alternatively, use this Windows tool.

Yep, either is fine to use - they both do the same thing. 

However, if you use the windows-only one from Mr Mouse, can you please also tell us the size of the archive (in bytes) so that we can rebuild it and do testing on it. No need to do this with the Java one though - it records that information for us automatically.

Thanks mate.

iirc If you look down the file a few bytes its a standard PK(zip) header.

Ah, I remember these now. I was talking about another format for wolfenstein for xbox. The cachemap is nothing but a "map" for the structure of the file. It does not actually contain what you are looking for. There is another format which has a PK header that contains everything you would need to mod the game. I don't think there is any actual data you need from a cachemap file.

PK...

That would make it a zip archive.

bump....

someone can analyze these files to see if possible the extraction of resources?(models , textures etc)

[http://www.mediafire.com/?gyk0mtky4olm6v1](http://www.mediafire.com/?gyk0mtky4olm6v1)


these files are very different at the .pk3 files but the location of the files and names with formats can viewed with a simple text reader. 

inside this files we can found maps (no bsp), models in .mds , .mdc , textures in .tga, scripts in .cfg , .scripts and some sound files in .wav

Thanks,I hope that I can help me.

is possible to extract the maps from the ps2 version using the emulador and dumping the ram. I obtain a point clouds from the map buried alive



but I can't link the faces to the point clouds. 

the xbox versi√≥n is more difficult because the same data is divided in little chunks instead the ps2 and pc versions where the data are continuous.

any possible help in better understanding structure of container is appreciate.
