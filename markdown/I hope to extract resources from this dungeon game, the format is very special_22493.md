Hi guys, sorry for my bad English     
I hope to extract resources from this dungeon game. The model is very good and the format is very special.
I searched under the label but no script was found
Does my friend know how to extract it?  :

File format: CSP
Hex:   [https://drive.google.com/file/d/10LXA8e ... sp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/10LXA8eRf59ihJ1d9BXYosvesFh4jEdkD/view?usp=sharing)

Name: Heavenly oath
Webpage: scrap
Sample files (4 files):

It seems that in those files there is 15 bytes header
and then you have uncompressed files one by another.
So there are no filenames, no offsets and probably no way to automatically extract all files.
You can do it manually if you know what are you looking for.
For example, if you look into music.csp, you can see lots of OGG files
and you can manually extract them in hex editor.

Thank you, I will try to extract ogg

Excuse me, is there any effective extraction software?

If extracting only common file formats is fine for you,
you can use File Stripper for this task [https://imgur.com/a/ndy07MT](https://imgur.com/a/ndy07MT)
