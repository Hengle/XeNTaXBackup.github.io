hi all

i want to translate games subtitles into my language, for example i have F.E.A.R 2 installed in my pc, and a few mins ago i was extracting every .Arch01 file . my question is that where is subtitle/text files and can i edit them or not?
( not just F.E.A.R 2, if you know anyway for other games like crysis 2, assassins creed:bh, splinter cell: conviction and  or other new games plz tell me )

Why is there the Search function, if you don't use it?!

for the search there is also another better trick that usually works in some forums where the Search sux (on mine it has never worked correctly).
go on google and insert the name of the game followed by site:xentax.com, example:

crysis 2 site:xentax.com
"crysis 2" site:xentax.com

the second example is more specific and could give better results, try both if in doubt.
I know that these are things that we already know but there are lot of people that don't even know how to use google :)
