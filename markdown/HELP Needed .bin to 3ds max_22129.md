- Post Title: HELP Needed .bin to 3ds max

I'm converting a game to unreal engine but having trouble in the animations,

I'm able to convert the .x to fbx with bones in it. It uses BIP01 and so one.

.bin ( animation container )
.cfg ( animation parameters)

The game files uses .bin and .cfg for it's animation.
Example file : [http://www.mediafire.com/file/44dvvdt3d ... d.zip/file](http://www.mediafire.com/file/44dvvdt3dp3zwbj/Sbx_Red_Dragon_Mount_Released.zip/file)
Included : Mesh in .x Format, .bin and cfg animations, textures.
