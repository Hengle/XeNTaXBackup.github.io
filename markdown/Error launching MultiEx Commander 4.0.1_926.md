- Post Title: Error launching MultiEx Commander 4.0.1

I get the follwing error dialogue upon launch:

MODMAIN: Initializing MC
INITMC: Loading Splash
INITMC: Getting mc32.exe path info
INITMC: Checking existence of MultiExDC
INITMC: MC_MRF = C:\Program Files\MultiEx Commander/data\config\mc.mrf
INITMC: Loading Connect Form
ERROR: 7-Out of memory


System is a Sony Vaio Laptop PCG-FX250
P-III 800
384 MB ram
800 MB swap file
XP SP1

FYI prior to installing 4.0.1 I had 3.9.69 and it would error out with a mscomctl.ocx invalid or missing.

Thanks.
Any help would be appreciated.
