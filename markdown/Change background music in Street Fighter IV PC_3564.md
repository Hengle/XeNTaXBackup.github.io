The music can be played very easily but I don't know of any encoder.
Just use winamp to play the music with in_vgmstream.dll 
[http://sourceforge.net/projects/vgmstream](http://sourceforge.net/projects/vgmstream).
Here is a sample audio file if anyone wants to make an encoder.
Have you tried replacing the file with a wave file and see if it plays?

this contains the original sound file and it converted to wave.
