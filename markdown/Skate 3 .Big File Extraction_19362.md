- Post Title: Skate 3 .Big File Extraction

Hey!

I'm looking at starting a complete rebuild of Skate 3 with modern graphics, etc. But I've gotten stuck on step 1. (Lol, I know, pathetic right?) Anyways, all the content files are zipped up into .Big files. I've tried programs like finalBig and dragon unpacker to view the files but when I go to open the files in these programs they just say they are unable to view them... Can someone help me get them open?

Also, if your interested in contributing to the project or have suggestions, I'm open...

Everyone thinks Skate 3 is big4, but actually not.
Skate 3 uses EB and not big4. 
So the most complete script is the Fightnight script.
