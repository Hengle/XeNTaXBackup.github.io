- Post Title: reinstalling

I foolishly deleted multiex commander awhile back. Or, at least I thought I did. I found the installer in the recycle bin and it seemed to work out fine. However, it refused to launch, saying it needed an internet connection.

 Since nothing else was working, I tried to delete Multiex commander entirely, then reinstall it using the installer. Some files refused to be deleted, and now I can't replace them in the multiex commander folder. I even tried installing it in a separate folder, but it now refuses to work.

The new error is :

Run-time error 339;

Component 'MSINET.OCX' or one of its dependancies not correctly registered; a file is missing or invalid

What do I have to do to fix this? I just want to get Multiex commander working again. I just hope it's possible. otherwise, there seems to be no way to edit pak files, which were resistant to being altered anyways with multiex commander (whenever I managed to replace an original pak file with a template, Necrovision refused to launch, claiming files I didn't even touch were missing).

This may not be much help, but did you try restarting your computer after uninstalling MexCom? If not, do so, then try deleting those last few files, restart again, and try reinstalling.

First of all, which version are we talking about here? 
Second, what OS are you using? 
Third, what folder did you use to do the first install.
Fourth, what exactly did you delete, to find in the recycle bin?
Fifth, which files refused to be deleted? 
Sixth, which email did you use to register MultiEx Commander? 

Please give this type of information, we can go from there.
