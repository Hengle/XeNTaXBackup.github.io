- Post Title: Request a bms script to convert msf to aa3.

Dear Sir,

I have the ps3 game Super Robot Wars OG The moon dwellers, i want to rip it music which is in format psarc. i used a program to decrypt it and it works and it gives me a file in msf, when i look in hex editors, i find these 2 texts such as wmsf and msfc.

So i tried to remove byte for wmsf up to msfc and then save it and try to use bms script - MSFtoAT3.bms and it convert it to ps3 at3.

Now, i tried the program Atrac3plus_tool and it convert it to aa3 but it dont open in sony sound forge pro 11.

Please any help.
