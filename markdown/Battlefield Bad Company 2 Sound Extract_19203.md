- Post Title: Battlefield Bad Company 2 Sound Extract

I know, BFBC2 kinda abandoned game in terms of ripping off resources. Found only one working technique to rip off sounds ([http://www.bfeditor.org/forums/index.ph ... rom-bfbc2/](http://www.bfeditor.org/forums/index.php?/topic/14539-extracting-sound-and-music-files-from-bfbc2/))

Yes, you can extract majority of the sounds. It works like a charm for long stereo sounds (ambient, cutscenes etc) But lots of gunfire sounds/ echo and such has it's own unextractable format.
There's only static sounds or silence after full extraction

Also, i'm using HxD editor to locate right offset. Tried different offsets but no luck.

For example:

[http://prntscr.com/lvzwlb](http://prntscr.com/lvzwlb)

Part in red box extracted like a charm, the rest is just silience or static sounds.

However this method dated by 2010. 

Probably anyone had success with full sound dump? 
Or this technique old as hell, and someone did new bms/python extraction scripts? 
And also, bear in mind this works only for XBOX360 game version, caused by .xma sound format.

I tried the method from bfeditor and yeah you're right, no all sounds were extracted. 
At least i have voices, musics and some vehicules sounds. 13 GB in total.
I think no new techniques will be released.

How did you get them? Did you extracted them or got them from somewhere else? Can you send me a PM for download link, please?

I have voices too but it's not extracted by me and does it also have vietnam voices and other voices?

If its .xma, try downloading foobar and vgmstream component to play them. If not, upload the original archives and I will look for you.

Hey guys just extracted BFBC2 sounds and voices using XBOX 360 ISO from yesterday and it works like a charm! 

But I haven't extracted many sounds, though. I would like focusing on the voices first.

I re-tried and this time i was able to extract 36 000 files, circa 29GB.
It was very hard btw but if you want some specific sounds send me a PM because i can't upload all the folder with my terrible connection (100 KB/s).

I know its been a while Damoclès, but is there any chance you would be willing to share the Scalar weapon sound effects here? Been looking for a longtime but I have had no luck

Hello there I've attempted so many times to extract sounds through these methods but no Joy. Is it all possible you can upload the vehicle sounds, like IFV's Tanks and so forth ? Really found these sounds immersive and desperately would love to have them.

Thank you so much man! Much appreciated. BC1 files are all there but BC 2 seems to be missing a lot of the vehicle files across the board Is this a error or not possible to extract all the audio files ? Some vehicles are missing like the BMD3 has no sound files ?
