- Post Title: Neverwinter Nights 2 Mysteries of Westgate

Hello everyone!
One of my friends would translate this expansion but we can't export the texts. If someone could help it would be nice. We think that the westgate2.hak file contain the texts, but it can't be opened by NWN2Packer (20080808) so if someone can make a text exporter and importer please help us. Thank you!
