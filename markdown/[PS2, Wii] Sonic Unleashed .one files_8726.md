- Post Title: [PS2, Wii] Sonic Unleashed .one files

I have extracted the files out of the APK (v2) archive but I can't see the correct file names with afsutils. It just lists them; file_1, file_2, etc.

Anyways, the files seem to have .one file extension in the header and inside with the hex editor I see file names like sonic_model_default.one, sonic_icon.gif, caution_message_ps2.one, NPC_Talk_Mykonos_t40_myk_night_Sheet1.fco to just name a few and the most interesting is the last one is the most interesting because it seems it was meant to be more like the PS3/X360 version.

I have found no information on the internet about any archive with .one extension.

So, does anyone know anything about it?

EDIT: I just saw that there is .ONE for Shadow the Hedgehog, but it doesn't seem to be the same version or same type at all.
