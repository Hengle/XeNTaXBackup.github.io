TMNT.bf unpacks with From Dust and The Adventures of Tintin bms scripts.

Unpacks 8005 files, but From Dust script without a decompression(dont works .bik files). The Adventures of Tintin have a error in the end of unpacking.

Main big files is .BINs with CPBK header. All is 133, different sizes - very smalls(kbs) and bigs(some MBs). Last 4 bytes is ECMP header.

.Bin files can be taken throught PM.
