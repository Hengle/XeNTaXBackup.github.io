Hello everyone,
Can anyone make a unpacker/packer for the data files for this game [http://www.multiupload.com/AXC1XGUSYW#](http://www.multiupload.com/AXC1XGUSYW#). It's called Rappelz. If you are willing to please pm me or leave a post in this thread.

Try searching through [http://www.elitepvpers.com/forum/rappelz/](http://www.elitepvpers.com/forum/rappelz/) if you haven't already.
They MIGHT have an unpacker.

Hi,

The unpacker is working great, we got mesh, weight but UVmap/coordinate look not good.

The NX3 import/export plugin for Blender is available on the same link as Finale00 said.

Here is a sample.
