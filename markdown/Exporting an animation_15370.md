- Post Title: Exporting an animation

Hi again, for starting i don't know too much how animation works so that's is what im trying to discover (for see if i can export this animation on a most common format if it is strange).

The first part of the file its an index to search each bone on animation (or some parameters that are contained in that), its an unsigned short and it need to be multiplied with 4 to go to that adress

The firts parts  after animation are useless for know space position of the animation in it.

This is the example file

Thanks for reading
