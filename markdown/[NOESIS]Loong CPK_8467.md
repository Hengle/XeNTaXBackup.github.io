- Post Title: [NOESIS]Loong CPK

Hi guys, i know that there are a topic about loong and i've the py script to import file, but the "archive" where there are model is CPK... i've seen that Noesis support CPK file but when i try to open this CPK file of loong with doble click, a window say me "File could not be previewed" and if i select the extension CPK in noesis and i go to the folder of this file, this file there aren't.

I've to use another program to extract this CPK files or is a problem of noesis?

i've another question, i've a model in FAK (is the extension of loong) and the textures in dds... i see the model in noesis without textures, how can i apply this texture in noesis?


SORRY FOR MY BAD ENGLISH BUT I'M ITALIAN

At the top of the script there's a constant called MODE. If 0, it just loads the selected model. If 1, it will load all models in the same folder
