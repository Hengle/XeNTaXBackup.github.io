- Post Title: Dragon Ball Z - Battle of Z music rip: from awb to bin

Hi.

I wanted to extract the music from DBZ - BoZ (PS3), so I went into the files and found some .awb files. Thinking that I just needed to extract these, and be done, I did just that using: AWB Tools. The extraction was a success, yet all the files were in .bin ... I tried opening them, and, as expected, got errors. [Here is one of those files that got extracted](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ve_jpUUQepcJiJGjcAJV-wP_37gzgKaK/view?usp=sharing).

If I missed something, or used the wrong set of tools, let me know. Thanks!

Nothing is wrong.

You just need to rename from the files from the extension ".bin" to ".hca" and then use the plugin 'vgmstream' to play them / convert them
