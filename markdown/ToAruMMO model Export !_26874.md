- Post Title: ToAruMMO model Export !

I want to import character models to blender from this game 

[https://toarumajutsunoindex.fandom.com/ ... obile_MMO)](https://toarumajutsunoindex.fandom.com/wiki/Toaru_Majutsu_no_Index_%28Mobile_MMO%29)

And I finally success unpack npk files, but I don't know how to convert and extract .dat files into 3d models.

I use this quickbms tool to unpack npk.

Quickbms script for extracting npk : [http://aluigi.altervista.org/bms/nxpk.bms](http://aluigi.altervista.org/bms/nxpk.bms)


There seems to be a program that can view models, but it seems to be infected with a virus and cannot be used.
