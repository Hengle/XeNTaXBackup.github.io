- Post Title: Dante's Inferno files

I have extracted the files out of the viv files off the Xbox 360 Dante's Inferno. When i look at the files, there just plain, all the file type says is "File".


I want the 3D model of Dante, but first I need to decipher these files.


Any help?

hi sidneymadmax,


Thanks for a reply. Is it possible for you to find a way to extract the 3d model of dante from the game somehow?

The reason I need it is for my open source game coming out soon. It's an open source version of super smash bros for pc, mac & linux.
