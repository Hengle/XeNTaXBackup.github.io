Hello,

Has anyone figured out how to reverse engineer the .savegamedata file in Lego Worlds? The save file also seems to be in other Travelers Tales games, such as Lego Batman 3.

It can be found in: C:\Users\<Username>\AppData\Roaming\Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment\LEGOWorlds\SavedGames\Slot#

Thanks.

Here you go: [https://www.mediafire.com/?ibh2c7t4cj74c3m](https://www.mediafire.com/?ibh2c7t4cj74c3m)

This contains some autosave data and the actual game save data as well. I believe it uses many forms of checksums to validate the save, since I cannot change a single value without the game treating it as corrupt.
