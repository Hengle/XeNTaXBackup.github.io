Hi Mr.Mouse, i am just letting you know all or most file downloads are missing from the tool blog in case there is a chance they can be restored. 
When you click on "Download" you get this message "File does not exist. Make sure you specified correct file name."

I know there is a problem. I never see Download by the way, just "Login to view". The files are all still there, it's just a matter of the link between the forum and the blog being broken somehow. 
It's on my to do list to fix.

Okay, I just opened it up for download for all. No need to have registered at the forum.
