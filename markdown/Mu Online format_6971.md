- Post Title: Mu Online format

Does anyone have the mu online (model) bmd file format as well as the decryption key?
There are many tools out there for it but I can't seem to find any source.

Otherwise I guess I could post up some models, but they're all encrypted.

Well i expert on this game, any you need ask me, the game have this format

Mesh: *.BMD
Animation *.BMD (Models with animations come in the same format *.BMD, Model and animation are stored in the same file)
Texture: *.OZJ,*.OZT (this can ve converted to JPG and TGA).

If you can wait 15 minutes i upload the tools you need to convert BMD to SMD, Smd half life format can be imported in milkshape or with SMD plugins for 3ds max.

Here the Pentium tools its a free version , this have hardware protection tool developed in Java, and work perfect to convert any BMD file to SMD same time convert the textures from OZJ or OZT to JPG or TGA. The tool doesn work to convert SMD to BMD, need full version and pay for he. (I have licence, cost by licence its $150USD)

The other aplication its SMDtoBMDConv.exe a working conversor to convert SMD to BMD (The point its this doesnt suport animations files only convert SMD to BMD withouth animations), for this you need make 2 folders enc and dec folders, put the SMDtoBMDConv.exe out of this 2 folders, then drag the SMD to the SMDtoBMDConv.exe and in the enc you found the smd converted to bmd, this include the textures.

P.D. by years experts and coders try make a conversor of smd to bmd with animations included but nobody can. Only the developer of Pentium Tools.

Good Luck.

Link for files and tools here:

[http://www.megaupload.com/?d=LY1K26C7](http://www.megaupload.com/?d=LY1K26C7) 
pass: 666

If you need a single triangle in bmd format you can make one, only make one in milkshape and then export to smd, before of this drag the triangle in smd format to the .exe conversor and with this you have a little file, maybe with this its more easy for you found a source code, i not have the source, i hear years ago in the firs client files Webzen forget the source code of this format in the main.exe of the game and Pentium found this and make the tool, but more than 50 mains are created for this game and 3 versions languajes.

I am actually interested in just the format and the encryption, not the tools, unless tools have source  
Maybe you can get ahold of some of that information as well?

finale00,

Just send me ([kz_3d@tvn.hu](mailto:kz_3d@tvn.hu)) a simple e-mail  and I will send to you some tools like 3d .bmd viewer+its source codes.
(I don't know where I did find these tools.)

Karpati, you think with this source codes its posible make the exporter or converter to the native format *.BMD of Mu Online?

Mu online have two *.BMD files, one with animations, another withouth animations, if its posible make the converter or exporter with animations included this can be a gread advance in moding this game.

This can be ussefull in the project i working

Rimbros,

I sent the programs/source codes by e-mail to you.
Your project seems to be very professional.

I was under the impression that Pentium had successfully wrote ... --> bmd. Maybe not?

Anyways you'll find that there are several unknowns in the bmdreader source, which may cause problems when trying to re-import back to the game.

There also is no source code for the decryption tool (at least, I couldn't find it), so you can't work with those encrypted models, though I don't know which ones that would be.

Pentium its a Genius Man, he successfully wrote the BMD format.

Thanks karpati by the source, the source Karpati have its source of meshes, not include bones and animations, anyway thanks, you release this karpati since 2008, i can tell you the BMD file of webzen its the same today.

Hmm lots of models are encrypted. Do you know if there are any command-line tools? Using the GUI is too slow.

the texture format is just stupid just delete the first 4 bytes then its a normal file
this will convert an ozt file

> get size asize
>
> get name basename
>
> string name + .tga

> math size - 4

here is the code to decrypt the bmd files

Actually, pretty much every data file for mu online uses the "bmd" format, each with different type of encryption.

There are some tools, but probably not many people bothered to look into it after tools were available.

i doubt they are different encryption ma bee they are but i doubt it.
you could just attach a debugger and step through the program that opens the files to get the encryption.
but these models look really low quality so i am not interested in it.
