- Post Title: How I extract cutscene video file from hitman 2016 rpkg file?

Hi there
I try extract hitman rpkg file with 
[https://www.moddb.com/games/hitman-worl ... /downloads](https://www.moddb.com/games/hitman-world-of-assassination/downloads)

But I cant find any cutscene video file available

Only get .cri .wav file etc... May I ask Where is cutscene video file location inside rpkg file?

No-way extract them directly?


Also I find this thread
[https://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=18303](https://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=18303)
Seems no way to extract cutscene video file?


Thank you!
