- Post Title: TMNT RESHELLED BF.EDAT ARCHIVE

[https://i.imgur.com/wBF86dx.png](https://i.imgur.com/wBF86dx.png)

This is the contents of the TMNT RESHELLED PSN directory.

My aim is to extract the data, replace the sfx and music and repack all of it.

Does anyone have any knowledge on opening the BF file

Ubisoft developed this game when they still had the license, can provide files on request.
