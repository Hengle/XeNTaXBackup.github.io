- Post Title: [Request]Mabinogi File Formats (various, $100 Per format)

So, since there doesn't seem to be a tremendous amount of interest in the topic I posted( [viewtopic.php?f=16&t=8946](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=8946) ), I was wondering if offering a cash reward per documented/explained file format would be more enticing?

Maybe something in the region of $100 per explained/documented file format? (You can document just one if you want)

I was looking to get PMG, FRM, SET, and possibly some map related files documented, so that custom content could be created.

For various tools that will help, including the unpacker: [http://puu.sh/vlIV](http://puu.sh/vlIV)

The client is available in several ways (fixed the links):
Full client (Traditional HTTP download): [http://download3.nexon.net/Game/Mabinog ... up101R.exe](http://download3.nexon.net/Game/Mabinogi/FullVersion/MabinogiSetup101R.exe)
Client without NPC music files (Same as above, minus NPC music): [http://download2.nexon.net/Game/Mabinog ... ht101R.exe](http://download2.nexon.net/Game/Mabinogi/LightVersion/MabinogiSetupLight101R.exe)
Horrible Pando Downloader (P2P downloader):  [http://download2.nexon.net/Game/Mabinog ... rV101R.exe](http://download2.nexon.net/Game/Mabinogi/Downloader/MabinogiDownloaderV101R.exe)

Let me know when PMing/Posting your findings how you'd prefer to receive payment (Paypal/some form of game card/etc).

Since there doesn't seem to be a lot of interest in these files, I decided to increase the amount to $100 per file format.

The renderer DLL in the client is the one that actually loads the files, and for most of them, it's quite clear where/what it's loading, however, I have yet to see a reference to the second half of the .FRM file.

Is it possible to attach the rendering DLL from the game, or is that against the rules?

I can't imagine what someone's going to do with a dll...

You can decompile it, and see the file calling sections o.o

It's actually confirmed a number of things for me, but the second half of the .frm still makes very little sense ^^;

I keep forgetting to post here, but pretty much every file format has already been unravelled, so these Mabinogi related threads I posted may as well be locked.
