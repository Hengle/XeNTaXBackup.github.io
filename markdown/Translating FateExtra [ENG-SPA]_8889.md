- Post Title: Translating Fate/Extra [ENG-SPA]

Hi all, to start is my first post and if this is not really in this section, so if not sorry. Now I will tell my story a bit:

I love to translate, I have translated several plays, and I've always been more or less well, with some difficulty but nothing unusual, I have not come to finish the translation 100% because I have always translated only, however the other day I decided to translate Fate Extra, after playing the first in English and having to be with the translator did not understand every word. I got it and has found the file where all the text, then try to translate directly from there I decided to remove everything and after a while looking for an exhaust CPK (file format) found one that I extracted everything perfectly. So far so good, and could even translate the menu, the problem is that within the CPK there are several files that are named exactly the same and occupy the same, so I asked to remove them or that they do not rename or remove , and tried to remove them and mount the 2 forms CPK does not work.

Solution would be to find a publisher to let me insert CPK files directly translated into the original CPK, if you know any work that you were to say I appreciate it.
The CriPackedFileMaker not work for this, since neither I nor removed from the file let me modify the original.

I'm fairly certain there's no way to change the files without unpacking them first, and then repacking them into the same format.

That's why translation patches are so difficult. The translation of English into Spanish isn't difficult, but getting the files to work in the game is.

You're not going to get around having to unpack and repack the files in the correct cpk format and version.
