- Post Title: [PS3] Full Auto 2 .YUK Headerless Atrac3

I looked at full auto 2 and it uses multichannel atrac3 but this time without a header. So alphas at3toaa3 script will not work as it needs the header and other info. If i remember correctly while playing the game it uses 7 streams which makes it 14 channels.

I tried several tricks to attach a header then try to decode but failed. very trickey format.

Okay it seems this is hardly interleaved, i tried to split the segments but its very hard and the stream has no clue on the interleave.
