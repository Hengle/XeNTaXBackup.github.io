- Post Title: Lord of the Rings War in the North DAT files - how to open?

Hello! Is there anyone who can help me to open .dat files from the game Lord of the Rings War in the North? They contains 3D landscapes and props, but I cannot find any DAT extractor, able to open them. The game exploits the Dark Alliance game engine, the same as in Baldur's Gate Dark Alliance and Fallout: Brotherhood of Steel. Full list is here - [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snowblind ... ame_engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snowblind_Studios_game_engine). I haven't played in these games and don't know if they use dat format or any other for 3D. If you have dealt with the game engine and know how to open such files and which tool to use, please help me by advice. I want to extract 3D geometry from these files, maybe convert it to OBJ or import to 3D Max etc. Here is one sample of such archives - [http://nekaka.com/d/4gP3vpyrFB](http://nekaka.com/d/4gP3vpyrFB) . It's the content of a location folder Lorien (architecture, props etc). Thank you for any participation, if you are willing to help.
