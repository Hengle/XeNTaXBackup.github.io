The extention .o3d was used by the 3D model format in "Darkstone". The editor for that format is called MakeO3D.

Google for make03d to find the editor. If that will open your files, then ask on the [Darkstone Forum](http://www.it-taucher.at/forum/index.php) for help- some people have done custom models for that game and may have info on exporting o3d to some other format.

bizzybody,

I compared these file formats and I know 100 % the Flyff's .o3d format is not the Darkstone's .o3d ones.

You are the 3D model format god!  
Would you mind having a look at this thread? [viewtopic.php?t=2546](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?t=2546)
We already collected some information, but some stuff is still missing.

I don't know how old this is but I really could use a model viewer for FLYFF, with textures and all. Models being .o3d and textures being .dds.

Yes, It is a very old thread, since someone ask for help on the new format so I reply it here!

Just have a quick look on the new file and relize that the overall Header format should be like this:

```
--------------
Header section
--------------
byte                nameLength
char[nameLength]    encFilename         //Encrypted with XOR 0xCD
dword               ?Version
byte X 4            ??
*byte X 32          ?Pad0               //Depand on version? v22 has 56 bytes
                                        //v21 or below should be 32 bytes
char[16]            encFilename2
float X 6           BoundingBox
float               ??                  //always 0.5
dword               ?Flag01
dword               ?Flag02
struct Flag02Data {
  float X 3         ??
}
dword               MeshTypeFlag
dword               LODFlag
dword               ?Flag03
dword               TotalMeshCount      //All Mesh and LOD
dword               MeshCount
```

Oh nice,
i found something today, aswell.

after the version dword you have something like

```
  float X3    XYZ element1 startpoint
  float X3    XYZ element1 endpoint
  if version == 22
    float X3    XYZ element2 startpoint
    float X3    XYZ element2 endpoint
  dword X2  ?? always 0x00

```


Edit: I figured it out now except the first dword
So the version dword probably tells what kind of effect is applied to the weapon. Clothing uses any version, but all floats set to 0x00 so no effects would appear, the clothing glow is probably "hard"-attached (shape of an character body wouldn't change normaly..). Some weapon have single "effect-row", some have two "effect-rows"..

i played a bit with the values xD [http://img.xrmb2.net/images/405730.jpeg](http://img.xrmb2.net/images/405730.jpeg)

So how do I utilize these codes. I have no idea what to do. I'm glad other people are interested though.

Sorry to reply to such an old post. I kinda lost track of this topic.
