- Post Title: Far Cry Instincts Predator (DAT)

Hello.

Maybe someone can make BMS script or other tools for unpacking Far Cry Instincts Predator archives?

For Far Cry Instincts, Evolution and Vengeance is have a [BMS script](http://wiki.xentax.com/index.php?title=Far_Cry_Evolution_DAT). But Instincts Predator archives extracting with ["incomplete Input" error](http://fs5.directupload.net/images/160516/ewox5963.jpg), if using this script. Some files is extracting, but wrong.

Samples of archives: [http://www.mediafire.com/download/g53da ... redator.7z](http://www.mediafire.com/download/g53dajhxc138a2q/Far+Cry+Instincts+Predator.7z)
