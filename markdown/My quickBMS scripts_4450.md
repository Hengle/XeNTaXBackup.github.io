generic batch file to apply quickBMS scripts to multiple files
If someone isn't very adept in batch file writing, here's a batch for processing multiple files with a quickBMS script. Just replace "*.ext" with the extension you need and  "script.bms" with the script you want to apply. Save the text as *.bat and run it. Of course this only works if you've added the quickbms path with the "SET" command in Windows.
```
for %%i in (*.ext) DO quickbms.exe -o script.bms "%%i" "%CD%" 
```
Otherwise, just put the quickbms.exe into the same folder as the script and the files and substiturte "quickbms.exe" with "%CD%\quickbms.exe" in the batch.

Critic and suggestions are always welcome.

CUE section extractor and adder for WAVE files
Ever worked with cue markers? Sadly all compressed formats lack the possibility to preserve the markers of wave files. To be able to save the markers and apply them to a decoded compressed file you maybe sent someone - use the following two scripts.
This one exracts the cue section and saves it as [name of wave file].cue:
```
string NAME += ".cue"

FindLoc OFFSET string "cue" 0 ""
if OFFSET != ""
   get SIZE asize
   math SIZE -= OFFSET
   log NAME OFFSET SIZE
endif
```
This one applies a cue section to a wave file with the same name. If the file already has a cue section, it saves it as [name of wave file].cueold and substitues it with the new one. Apply the script to the wave file, it will automatically open the *.cue file.
```
string NAME += ".cueold"
FindLoc OFFSET string "cue" 0 ""
if OFFSET != ""
   get SIZE asize 0
   math SIZE -= OFFSET
   log NAME OFFSET SIZE
else
   get SIZE asize
endif
log MEMORY_FILE 0 SIZE
open FDDE CUE 1
get CSIZE asize 1
append
log MEMORY_FILE 0 CSIZE 1
append
get NAME filename  0
math SIZE += CSIZE
log NAME 0 SIZE MEMORY_FILE
```

WAVE format scanner
I already posted this inside some other topic but I'll include it here, too. Simple wave scanner. Doesn't search for the "RIFF" string as I once accidentially found it inside some other data structures where it wasn't a wave file. Instead it searches for the WAVEfmt part and extracts the file.
```
   FindLoc OFFSET STRING "WAVEfmt" 0 ""
   if OFFSET != ""
      math OFFSET -= 8
      goto OFFSET
      FindLoc DATA STRING "data" 0 ""
      math DATA += 4
      goto DATA
      get SSIZE long
      savepos HEADER
      math HEADER -= OFFSET
      set SIZE HEADER
      math SIZE += SSIZE
      get NAME basename
      string NAME += "_"
      string NAME += i
      string NAME += ".wav"
      log NAME OFFSET SIZE
   else
      cleanexit
   endif
next i
```


WMV format scanner
When I ripped Darksiders I needed to scan for WMV files but strangely I know of no file scanner that is able to scan for WMV files. So I wrote my own. 
```
   FindLoc OFFSET string \x30\x26\xb2\x75\x8e\x66\xcf\x11 0 ""
   if OFFSET != ""
      get NAME BASENAME
      string NAME += "_"
      if i < 10
         string NAME += "0"
      endif
      string NAME += i
      string NAME += ".wmv"

      set SIZE OFFSET
      math SIZE += 0x176
      goto SIZE
      get SIZE long
      math SIZE += 0x176
      
      log NAME OFFSET SIZE
   endif
next i
```

EA *.mus extractor
Extracts the segments from newer Electronic Arts games *.mus containers. Will soon post a pack how to decode contained xma segments from Xbox 360 games

	math OFFSET += START
	get UNKNOWN long
	get SIZE long

	get ZERO long
	set NAME BNAME
	string NAME += i
		savepos MYOFF
		goto INFO
		get UNKNOWN short
		get FREQ short
		reverseShort FREQ
		get ID1 byte # unknown
		get ID2 byte # segment length
		get ID3 byte # segment number
		get ID4 byte # segment type
		get ZERO long
		get ZERO long
		savepos INFO
		goto MYOFF
		# string NAME += "_"

		# string NAME += ID2
		string NAME += "_"
		string NAME += ID3
		string NAME += "_"
		string NAME += ID4
		string NAME += "_"
		string NAME += FREQ
	string NAME += ".ea"
	log NAME OFFSET SIZE
next i
```

Explanation: all extracted files have the format "name_#_segid_segtype_freq.ea". # is just a successing number to avoid duplicates, segid is a segment ID (shows which segments belong together) and segtype shows some information about the segment, e.g. if there's a beat at the beginning or distinguishes different beats. freq is just the frequency. You'll need it for the header in addXMARIFFHeader.bms (see below). You may un-comment the lines for ID1 and ID2 but it's not really necessary.

EAMUS segment conversion batch (Xbox 360 only)
Put ea_multi_xma.exe (by HCS), xmaparse.exe (by HCS), addXMARIFFHeader.bms (see above) and towav.exe (by xplorer) in the folder with the extracted files and run it. 

> for %%i in (*.ea) DO ea_multi_xma.exe %%i
>
> for %%i in (*.ea_stream1) DO xma_parse.exe %%i -1 -r "%%~ni.hxma"
>
> for %%i in (*.hxma) DO quickbms.exe -o addXMARIFFHeader.bms "%%i" "%CD%"
>
> @towav.exe *.*
>
> @ECHO "Deleting temporary files..."
>
> @del *.xma
>
> @del *.hxma
>
> @del *.ea_stream1
>
> @md WAV
>
> @move *.wav WAV
>
> @ECHO "Done!"
>
> pausenote 1: for XMA2 files skip the marked "-1".
note 2: adjust the sample rate in addXMARIFFHeader.bms to that of the segments
note 3: to process multilayered or multichannel streams, just add batch lines for each layer:
> for %%i in (*.ea_stream2) DO xma_parse.exe %%i -1 -r "%%~ni_l2.hxma"
>
> ...
>
> @del *.ea_stream2

Thanks alot Alpha.

EDIT; hmm can you adjust or tell me how to adjust the script for this mus file from the simpsons game?

[http://www.megaupload.com/?d=BAI49Z7V](http://www.megaupload.com/?d=BAI49Z7V)

They seem to extract at the FC01 flag.

file_deinterleave.bms
Sometimes it's necessary to deinterleave certain formats, e.g. multilayer VAG files. Just adjust header (= unprocessed area), layer count and interleave inside the script. 
If you set the layer count (LAYERS) to 1 and change the skip value, you can eleminate portions of data within a file that repeat, e.g. block headers. This is the case for an AT3 format sometimes used in PS3 games (HEADER: 0, INTERL: 0x2b8, SKIP: 0x8).
Note that the last block is divided into equal parts so that the resulting files will have the same size. If the last block isn't dividable by the layer count, the script stops with an error message.

```
set INTERL 0x6000
set SKIP 0x0
set LAYERS 8
set JUMP INTERL
math JUMP *= LAYERS # JUMP = size of one block
math INTERL -= SKIP
	get TEST asize
	math TEST %= LAYERS
	if TEST != 0
		print "Illegal deinterleave parameters! Aborting..."
		cleanexit
	endif
get CYCLES asize
math CYCLES /= JUMP # number of interleave blocks
get RES asize
math RES %= JUMP # size of last interleave block
#print "residuum: %RES%"
math RES /= LAYERS # size of single last interleave

if RES != 0
	print "Warning: last block is incomplete! Check your parameters!"
endif


for i = 1 <= LAYERS
	log MEMORY_FILE 0 0
	set OFFSET i
	math OFFSET -= 1
	math OFFSET *= INTERL
	math OFFSET += HEADER
	append
	for k = 1 <= CYCLES
		log MEMORY_FILE OFFSET INTERL
		math OFFSET += JUMP
		math OFFET += SKIP
	NEXT k
	if RES != 0 # incomplete but valid last block
		set OFF i
		math OFF -= 1
		math OFF *= RES
		math OFFSET -= JUMP
		math OFFSET -= SKIP
		math OFFSET += OFF
		log MEMORY_FILE OFFSET RES
	endif
	append
	get SIZE asize MEMORY_FILE
	get NAME basename
	if LAYERS != 1
		string NAME += "_"
		string NAME += i
	endif
	log NAME 0 SIZE MEMORY_FILE
next i

Prototype *.p3d XMA2 extractor
This script extracts the XMA2 stream from Prototype Xbox 360 *.p3d files. The resulting file needs to be rebuilt to XMA1 (the -r option of xma_parse). Adding a 48kHz stereo header with my script results in toWAV-decodable files.

FSB_scan.bms

Simply scans a file for included FSB containers. The *.xxx files of many UT3-engine based games for example can't (yet) be extracted, so it's handy to scan them for FSB containers. And of course if you're too lazy to write your own bms script for a container but you only need the contents of the contained *.fsb files, this is the way to go. Currently supports FSB3 and FSB4.

```
# ver. 1.1 by AlphaTwentyThree 07-07-2010
# scans for FSB3 and FSB4 containers

get BNAME basename
string BNAME += "_"
get FSIZE asize
set i 1
set XSIZE 0

for
	FindLoc OFFSET string "FSB" 0 ""
	if OFFSET != ""
		set SKIP 0
		goto OFFSET
		getDstring VER 4
		if VER == "FSB3"
			set HEADCORR 0x18
			elif VER == "FSB4"
			set HEADCORR 0x30
		else
			set SKIP 1
		endif
		if SKIP == 0   
			get FILES long
			get HEADER long
			math HEADER += HEADCORR
			get SIZE long
			if size > 0
				set TSIZE SIZE
				math TSIZE += XSIZE
				if TSIZE < FSIZE
					math SIZE += HEADER
					set NAME BNAME
					string NAME += i
					string NAME += ".fsb"
					log NAME OFFSET SIZE
					math i += 1
					math XSIZE += SIZE # size of extracted files
					math OFFSET += SIZE
					goto OFFSET
				endif
			endif
		endif
	else
		cleanexit
	endif
next
```
Note: The extracted files are named after their origin container.

change_freq.bms
Did it ever happen to you that you ripped a lot of files by hand or added a custom header when you realize that you've set the frequency wrong? Especially when working with GENH or when you've deleted all the headerless files you worked with before it can be really annoying. This script writes the defined frequency to a defined offset. Just set quickBMS to overwrite and there you go. Very simple. 

```
set OFFSET 0x0c # offset of old frequency
get SIZE asize
putVarChr MEMORY_FILE SIZE 0
log MEMORY_FILE 0 0
append
log MEMORY_FILE 0 SIZE
append
putVarChr MEMORY_FILE OFFSET FREQ long
get NAME basename
string NAME += "_new."
get EXT extension
string NAME += EXT
log NAME 0 SIZE MEMORY_FILE
```


And here is a scrip to divide a given frequency by 2 (needed on e.g. decoded wave files from Resident Evil 6 Xbox 360):

```
goto OFFSET
get FREQ long
math FREQ /= 2
get SIZE asize
putVarChr MEMORY_FILE SIZE 0
log MEMORY_FILE 0 0
append
log MEMORY_FILE 0 SIZE
append
putVarChr MEMORY_FILE OFFSET FREQ long
get NAME basename
string NAME += "_new.wav"
log NAME 0 SIZE MEMORY_FILE
```

add6chXMAHeader.bms
Ever got sick of extracting and rebuilding the three stereo channel sets of multichannel XMA2 files? Here's a script that adds a multichannel XMA2 header to a headerless file, which is then decodable by toWAV.

```
endian big
putVarChr MEMORY_FILE 0x7b4 0x78327374 long
putVarChr MEMORY_FILE 0x7b8 0x3c byte
putVarChr MEMORY_FILE 0x7c4 0x0A000100 long
putVarChr MEMORY_FILE 0x7ca 0xb4c2 short
putVarChr MEMORY_FILE 0x7d0 0xFFFF0100 long
putVarChr MEMORY_FILE 0x7e6 0x803f1600 long
putVarChr MEMORY_FILE 0x7ec 0x8026 short
putVarChr MEMORY_FILE 0x7f0 0x2601 short
putVarChr MEMORY_FILE 0x7f4 0x303f short
putVarChr MEMORY_FILE 0x7f8 0x64617461 long # data
endian little

set FREQ 48000
set BLOCKSIZE 0x3000

get NAME basename
get SIZE asize
string NAME += ".xma"
set RIFFSIZE SIZE
math RIFFSIZE += 0x7F8

putVarChr MEMORY_FILE 0x04 RIFFSIZE long
reverseLong FREQ
putVarChr MEMORY_FILE 0x20 FREQ long
reverseLong BLOCKSIZE
putVarChr MEMORY_FILE 0x2C BLOCKSIZE long
putVarChr MEMORY_FILE 0x7FC SIZE long

append
log MEMORY_FILE 0 SIZE
append
math SIZE += 0x800
log NAME 0 SIZE MEMORY_FILE
```
Note: I didn't set the memory to the actual header as most of it consists of zeroes.

It's from Ace Combat 6, maybe you remember the old thread where most of the XMA2 questions were solved.  But yeah I guess it's the first working program to process multichannel XMA2 files.

XA_deinterleave.bms
Many Playstation games have interleaved XA files to save their music. Each interleaved XA file consists of exactly 8 or 16 layers (will need to add support). Each layer starts with [00FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF001430][number byte][02][01][layer number byte][audio designator byte][01]. If the file is stereo, the last dword is repeated. The file interleave is always 0x930, that's the distance to each [00FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF001430]-block. The audio designator is 0x64 if audio is present and 0x00 if the layer is empty. In this case the layer number is also 0x00. That's one of the reasons why PSX images are highly compressable.  
Each of the block headers stays intact inside the stream. If a stream is finished, the last block has either the audio designator 0xE4 and all subsequent blocks have 0x48 OR the last block is normal (0x64) and all subsequent blocks have 0x00 as designator.
In some cases (take Descent II PSX for example), the track end isn't designated at all but the last few ms of the track are repeated till the end of the layer. I haven't yet found a way to cut these file correctly.
The following script deinterleaves those streams, cuts each stream at a given stop designator and adds a CDXA header. The files are playable with in_vgmstream.dll (newest release). Currently there is no "empty layer" support yet, but I'll code that later. If there's some header present before the [00FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF001430]-block, just adjust the HEADER variable.

But how can i join segments which belong together?
1. please shorten your message 
2. simple answer: Manually  I deliberately left it open because it's a matter of taste how to join the segments. You could just use Winamp's DiskWriter plugin for example.

- Post Title: Re: My quickBMS scripts

You actually can't distinguish between the different sample rates of headerless XMA files from seeing the code. The only thing that's reliable: if toWAV doesn't decode the file correctly, it's probably the wrong sample rate or number of channels. However, toWAV doesn't seem to distinguish between 44,100 Hz and 48,000 Hz as it decodes both variants without errors. Either you search for a soundtrack, downloadable tracks from the composer's page or some other hint among the other files via hex editor. In many cases the XMA stream has a small header that states the sample rate. But be sure to cut that portion first before adding a header.

extract_spk.bms
Extracts the *.spk sound archives from Splinter Cell: Conviction. Works on both PC and Xbox 360 version. 

```
string BNAME += "_"
FindLoc DAT string \x02\x23\x00\x08 0 "" # data start (= offset correction)
set FILES DAT
math FILES -= 0x40
math FILES /= 8
goto 0x40
set OFFSET DAT
for i = 1 <= FILES
	get DUMMY long
	get SIZE long
	set NAME BNAME
	string NAME += i
	log NAME OFFSET SIZE
	math OFFSET += SIZE
next i
```
Note 1: To convert the files of the PC version further, use Zench's DecUbiSnd tool.
Note 2: To convert the Xbox 360 files, use PoP360XMA (from this forum), rebuild the XMA2 stream, add an XMA header and decode them with toWAV.

It's a variant of uncompressed PCM and can be transformed to non-interleaved PCM (e.g. with Winamp's DiscWriter plugin). The format itself is of course uncompressed.

```

I'm not entirely sure if the actually is an interleave... Note that this format is different from Playstation ADPCM and occurs for example when you demux *.pss videos with PSSDemux (Zophar's Domain). 
If you encounter files you have problems with, let me know and I'll take a look.

addXboxADPCMheader.bms
Adds an adjustable and toWAV-decodable Xbox ADPCM header to headerless files or skips a given header area (for headers that aren't supported by toWAV). Normally those files have a simple ".wav" extension but you don't want toWAV to overwrite the original files, so I changed it to ".xba" (Xbox audio).
The new revision will adjust the header according to the channels (now also supports mono streams) and can detect the channels automatically. However, this option will only work if the stream doesn't start with a silence but with that 0x????0000 marker. 
To find out the stream start and channel count manually, open the file in a hex editor and set the column size to 0x24. If you see a 1-byte zero column, the file is mono, otherwise it's stereo (you can check that by setting the column size to 0x48, there should be two zero columns). A valid stream start is marked by a 0x0000 at the start of the first column.

at3_to_aa3+smpl.bms
Changes an AT3+ (Atrac 3 plus) header to a valid OMA header (*.aa3) and automatically extracts the smpl area if there is one available (that's the loop points). This is the format used by most of the PSP games and seems also common among PS3 games. The resulting files can be decoded by Sony SoundForge or sometimes played by KMPlayer. The *.smpl files may be injected in decoded wave files again with my smpl_inject (link see first post). However the sample transition at3:wav isn't 1:1 so the loop points are biased and only serve as a help when editing tracks. If somebody could help me adjusting the loop points, that'd be awesome!

Thanks alpha.

However it does not work for a standard stereo 48hz file i tried. Not sure if it has to do with regular atrac3 or atrac3plus. Also this file has a MSF header at the start.

func_header_AT3.bms
This is a header adder function for standard RIFF at (no AT3+).
Note that Atrac files only have 66, 105 or 132 kbps. If you don't know which one of them they have, you'll have to try out, I haven't found a way to distinguish between them. As always, you'll need a headerless file. 

```
# Needed variables: OFFSET, SIZE, BITRATE, FREQ, CH
# Note that mono atrac files are non-standard and automatically saved as stereo.
# To get the original file, decode the stereo at3 to wav and change the channels via hex.

- Post Title: Re: My quickBMS scripts

The following two scripts are for transferring the loop points from PSP and PS3 AT3+ files to decoded wave files. Background: AT3+ needs to be traversed into OMA first to decode it with Sony SoundForge which deletes the looping cues. Use the first script to extract the cues from the *.at3 files, then write them to the decoded *.wav files with the second script. It will overwrite the files. Note that the looping cue isn't at the very right spot as I don't know how the AT3 samples are represented in the decoded WAV. It's some ms off, but if it's not at the very beginning of the stream you'll get the idea about where the cue should be.
The second procedurecan also be used to inject a *.smpl file into any wave file with the same name. If that wave file already has a "smpl" are in the header, the script automatically saves the old one as *.smpl_old and substitutes it with the new.

Function that converts a string representation of an integer to an integer varialble. Needed for func_XMA_header.bms for example. 
The string you want to convert has to be named NUM.

```
    set TONUM 0
    strlen l NUM
    for i = 0 < l
        set EXP l
        math EXP -= i
        math EXP -= 1
        set B 0xA
        math B p EXP
        getVarChr T NUM i
        math T -= 0x30
        math T *= B
        math TONUM += T
    next i
    set NUM TONUM
endfunction

Regarding your uploaded samples: all *.mft files can bee converted with the above script. I've also looked at the other two files: 
- SND0.at3 is standard AT3+ and has to be turned into an *.aa3 with my at3toaa3.bms script before you can open it with SoundForge.
- The Audio.at3 can be parsed with the script in the next post. It's a headerless AT3+ file. The script transforms it into an *.aa3 file so that SoundForge can open it.

Audio.at3 obtained through this program [http://ifolder.ru/19566825](http://ifolder.ru/19566825) (get from ps3ripkits.com)

This program can convert .pmf psp movie files and .pam ps3 movie files(if rename to .pmf) to uncompress .avi(video) and .at3(audio).

I've attached a program that can convert PMF to parsed AT3+ files (with RIFF header). I downloaded it from some chinese site, can't remember which one.  Use my at3toaa3.bms to convert the results into decodable aa3 files (open with SoundForge).

Thanks! Works.

pmfdemux don`t work with .pam ps3 video files(message - this is not PMF).
PMF2AVI&AT3 has APPCRASH with .pam files from another game(White Knight Chronicles EX Edition).

MSF converter
Converts PS3 *.msf files into valid *.at3, *.ss2 and *.wav files. Not all variants are supported yet so if you encounter some problem, just PM me and I'll try to add support. 
Note that some MSF files with AT3 stream state the wrong frequency in the header. The script will tell you when such a file is found. You'll have to change the frequency with [viewtopic.php?f=13&p=71565#p71565](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=13&p=71565#p71565).

extractXWS.bms
Extracts the Atrac files from *.xws containers (used in some PS3 games). Header is automatically adjusted, files are playable with the Atrac codec installed. Note: DO NOT OPEN ATRAC FILES WITH SONY SOUNDFORGE - ONLY ATRAC3+ FILES!!! It somehow gets the samples of simple Atrac files totally wrong when the sample count isn't adjusted (which none of the scripts does). However, I'm not sure if it's necessary to adjust the samples because I have the feeling that the (necessarily) calculated samples of audio editors could be wrong. The samples could be the value at offset 0x8 into the "fact" area of the header. Compared to the calculated samples in Audition for example, there's quite a discrepancy. Can anyone explain or clear this?

thanks a lot AlphaTwentyThree for scripts. Im noob and until today i didn know about quickbms, but with Your scripts a had  successful extracted tracks from Skate 3 on Xbox 360. I suggest better file naming - sorting in explorer doesnt work good with this filenames, but there is always search function  Also Your header script  was useful for another rip. Is there any chance to make script which will combine WAV files? I combine one song manually and its painfull;

Glad you could use some of the scripts here.  Skate 3 was actually the game I wrote the EA script for. You can change the script if you want to use the information otherwise, I just throw all the info into the filename because it shows which segments belong together.
Combining segments is only easy when the files really match, i.e. if there's no silence or click at the transition. Try it first by combining the segments with Winamp. If you play the song and don't hear any transition: play and close your eyes to be unable to see where the transitions are - if you don't hear anything, the combining is ok. Then just switch to the old DiscWriter Plugin to write the merged file to disc. I think I also wrote this into the EA segments post. If you have any questions, just ask here.

Hehe 
The plugin is neat because it stream-dumps the data onto disk DIGITALLY - unlike loop-recording with your soundcard, which is always ANALOGUE!

In single file mode the default setting is 44hz i can't remove that setting, nor is there a setting to keep the default rate of the file.

Changes an AT3+ (Atrac 3 plus) header to a valid OMA header (*.aa3). This is the format used by most of the PSP games and seems also common among PS3 games. The resulting files can be decoded by Sony SoundForge or played by KMPlayer.

Yeah well, as I said, the line "get FREQ long" means that the frequency is hard-coded into the container. If you really need to change it, just comment the line and substitute it by "set FREQ 44100" or whatever frequency you like. I just can't believe they coded the wrong frequency into their own container...

The ea XA version im using is the old ea xa with headers, it is from Need for speed carbon and therefore i can't use your script because the old container doesn't have the same filetable structure as the new one, so i have to scan the xa headers and extract them, there native rate is 36hz. the winamp plugin file merge doesn't have a 36hz option and you can't enter your own, its strictly set to default at 44hz.

Never mind anyway i have found another app that can help me.

Buzz Quiz TV.

Attached below is a headerles atrac3 with a non-riff or msf header, i think it maybe plus seeing as the standard at3 header doesn't work nor the aa3 script with 48hz set.

Take a look please?

Nothing more to say here I guess... Please don't post about things you don't know for sure - it might confuse other users.

I'm in the structure of the old containers so I could update my script! Can you upload one of the containers please? Thanks!

EDIT; i think its doing something wrong because when i try your script on the file it gets the channel count wrong (14 ch) also the file doesn't decode all the way, just plays a couple of seconds of music.

Upload a file where it doesn't work and I'll take a look. Works fine for the one you uploaded. And btw, don't open the files with SoundForge, it get's many things wrong with simple atrac files. Just use Audition, WaveLab or GoldWave.

Strange, when import the menu track in audition it starts playing but then it cuts off and crashes the program. in explorer dbpoweramp shows a runtime of over 6minutes, that can't be right unless if the file is compressed really small.

EA_ASF_scan.bms
Just scans for the older EA *.asf files. Can be used on the other *.mus containers that don't contain any header information.

```
string BNAME += "_"
set OFFSET 0

for i = 1
    goto OFFSET
    FindLoc OFFSET string "\x53\x43\x48\x6c\x2c\x0\x0\x0" 0 ""
    goto OFFSET
    FindLoc SIZE string "\x53\x43\x45\x6c\x8" 0 ""
    math SIZE += 5
    math SIZE -= OFFSET
    set NAME BNAME
    string NAME += i
    string NAME += ".asf"
    log NAME OFFSET SIZE
    math OFFSET += SIZE
next i
```

Hm, I can try but some of the variables are unknown to me so I have no idea which value they should hold. But maybe it works nevertheless - I have no possibility to test it, though. Will drop you a PM when I get to coding it.

Updated the script to add PS2 ADPCM (*.ss2) headers - a test was missing if the interleave and stream size fit together.

func_header_SS2.bms
My second and more sophisticated approach to add a custom PS2 ADPCM SS2 header for vgmstream. I've used the include function and kept the main function as small as possible so that most of the actions needed are done in the function. Thus, scripts for other PS2 headers can be very easily and quickly assembled (just some 'go' and 'get' commands). As you can see I also updated the script with a memory pre-allocation to make it _way_ faster. 

```
# needed variables: 
# OFFSET, SIZE, FREQ, CH, INTERLEAVE, NAME (optional)
# (c) 2012-04-10 by AlphaTwentyThree of XeNTaX

startfunction SS2
	set MSIZE SIZE
	math MSIZE += 0x38
	putVarChr MEMORY_FILE MSIZE 0
	log MEMORY_FILE 0 0
	set MEMORY_FILE binary "\x53\x53\x68\x64\x18\x00\x00\x00\x10\x00\x00\x00\xb0\x36\x00\x00\x02\x00\x00\x00\xc0\x2f\x00\x00\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\x53\x53\x62\x64\x00\xe8\x11\x00"
	append
	log MEMORY_FILE OFFSET SIZE
	append
	
	putVarChr MEMORY_FILE 0xc FREQ long
	putVarChr MEMORY_FILE 0x10 CH byte
	putVarChr MEMORY_FILE 0x14 INTERLEAVE long
	putVarChr MEMORY_FILE 0x24 SIZE long
	if NAME == ""
		get NAME basename
		string NAME += ".ss2"
	endif
	get SIZE asize MEMORY_FILE
	log NAME 0 SIZE MEMORY_FILE
endfunction
```


Example for external access:

```
# (c) 2012-04-10 by AlphaTwentyThree of XeNTaX

include "func_header_SS2.bms"
set FREQ 44100
set CH 2
set INTERLEAVE 0x2400
set OFFSET 0x800
set NAME ""
get SIZE asize
math SIZE -= OFFSET
callfunction SS2 1
```

Once again OJ here with another riveting format 

Call Of Duty black ops this time around treyarch did not add any headers to there ms adpcm audio. well RIFF headers, instead there is another custom header with sample and channel count.
but can't get any other info to decode to add a proper header in genh.
[http://www.megaupload.com/?d=K9PA9KQH](http://www.megaupload.com/?d=K9PA9KQH)

Your ima adpcm header did not work.

Your ima adpcm header did not work.Of course it doesn't work when it's MS ADPCM...  Well, this finally looks like I have to write some MS_ADPCM heasder adder. Such a coincidence that I was taking a look at Two Worlds (PC), which also has a MS ADPCM header variant. But I couldn't figure it out yet, seems like some variable is in the wrong place. Playing time is correct, it's just not played properly. Don't use GENH, development has stopped there and who knows how long those *.genh files are still playable. I've changed to the original headers, too.

Quake_4_X360_xpr.bms
Just coded a script to extract those *.xpr sound containers of Quake 4 for the Xbox 360.  The extracted XMA files have an XMA header variant so I'll write another script that converts these to decodable XMA files with seek table.

```
endian big
get INFOSIZE long
get DATASIZE long 
get FILES long
set OFFCORR INFOSIZE
math OFFCORR += 0xc

for i = 1 <= FILES
	getDstring EXT 4
	get HEADER long
	get HEADERSIZE long
	get OFFSET long
	get SIZE long
	get NAMEPOS long
	math HEADER += 0xc
	math NAMEPOS += 0xc
	math OFFSET += OFFCORR
	savepos MYOFF
	goto NAMEPOS
	get NAME string
	string NAME += "."
	string NAME += EXT
	savepos NAMEPOS
	goto MYOFF
	log MEMORY_FILE 0 0
	append
	log MEMORY_FILE HEADER HEADERSIZE
	log MEMORY_FILE OFFSET SIZE
	get SIZE asize MEMORY_FILE
	log NAME 0 SIZE MEMORY_FILE
	append
next i
```

Generic file splitter
This is a VERY powerful script if you encounter a game archive with various files of one type in it but without information table. Happens quite often in PS2 games I realized now. The script searches for occurances of a given string and splits up the file where such an occurance is found.
You find some really useful suggestions for some split types inside the script. Remember to adjust the other variables accordingly of you use one of them (see comments in script).
What you have to adjust:

set OFFSET # - offset where the first file to be written starts. If you leave it at zero, the script will also write the area before the first occurance of the search string to disk
set SKIP # - if you want to leave out bytes after the designated searchstring, put that here. Can be negative (e.g. when you don't want to distinguish between RIFF and RIFX files, just search for "WAVEfmt" and set SKIP to -8)
set NEGBIAS # - if the split identifier is at the end of a file (like stop markers), adjust this to the length of the identifier. E.g. if some file type always ends in 0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF, search for \xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff and set NEGBIAS to 8.
set SIZEBIAS # - STANDARD VALUE IS -1! If you want to extract only one type of file and the file size is given in the header, set this to the according value. With this option, the script works as a file scanner (!).
set REV 0/1 - if the file size from the above offset is big endian, just set this to 1
FindLoc SIZE string # 0 "" - String or hex code to be searched. Hex code as always in C notation (see posted script)

Note 1: The first file to be written doesn't have any extension. It's the data block before the first found instance of the search string.
Note 2: If the search string isn't found, no data is written to disk
Note 3: The last extracted file always stops at the end of the file, so it usually contains more data than what you need.
Note 4: If you have an archive with more than one file type inside (multiple identifiers), run the script multiple times (first on the main archive, then on the extracted files).
Note 4: another use of this script is to split a file by zero blocks. For this, set the search string to the minimum zero block you need and set NEGBIAS to the length of the block you provided. Of course the script won't leave out zeros at the start of the next found split point but as a hint: you can run this script multiple times. 

Example to use this as a wave scanner:
set EXT ".wav"
set SIZEBIAS 4
set REV 0
set MINSIZE 0x10 (just estimated)
FindLoc SIZE string "RIFF" 0 ""

```
# very powerful for raw ripping
# (c) 2013-10-30 by AlphaTwentyThree of XeNTaX

set OFFSET 0 # begin scan here

           # (use negative value if search identifier is after file start)
set NEGBIAS 0x0 # search string at end of file e.g. stop markers (positive value!)
set EXT ".segs" # add this extention
set NAMEPOS "" # if all files are the same type and you know the position of the names
set SIZEBIAS 0xc # offset bias where file size is found
set REV 1 # 0 = leave, 1 = big endian

The script already converts msf to playable at3 - that's why it's called msf2at3... dude, look at the files in hex.

I just checked, I can play the files with Windows Media Player. Where did you download the Atrac codec from? Can you play the file with KMPlayer?

This is a VERY useful script if you encounter a game archive with various files of one type in it but without information table. Happens quite often in PS2 games I realized now.
Great!Universal scanner

This is a VERY useful script if you encounter a game archive with various files of one type in it but without information table. Happens quite often in PS2 games I realized now. The script searches for occurances of a given string and splits up the file where such an occurance is found.
What you have to adjust:
set OFFSET # - offset where the first file to be written starts. If you leave it at zero, the script will also write the area before the first occurance of the search string to disk
math SEARCH += # - enter the length of the search string here
FindLoc SIZE string "#" 0 "" - String or hex code to be searched. Hex code as always in C notation (see posted script)
Code: Select allget BNAME basename
string BNAME += "_"
set OFFSET 0
set SEARCH OFFSET
math SEARCH += 8
set QUIT 0
for i = 1
	goto SEARCH
	FindLoc SIZE string "\x41\x48\x56\x0\x44\x0\x0\x0" 0 ""
	if SIZE == ""
		get SIZE asize
		set QUIT 1
	endif
	math SIZE -= OFFSET
	set NAME BNAME
	string NAME += i
	log NAME OFFSET SIZE
	if QUIT != 1
		math OFFSET += SIZE
		set SEARCH OFFSET
		math SEARCH += 8 # needs to be the lengh of the search string
	else
		cleanexit
	endif
next i

Example: if you don't need the information before the first occurance of "RGHJ", which is at OFFSET 0x354, the lines are
Code: Select all...
set OFFSET 0x354
...
math SEARCH += 4
....
FindLoc SIZE string "RGHJ" 0 ""

How to convert hex code to C notation format?

You can see it inside the script - that \x.. \x.. format, that's C notation. For longer sequences, use byte2hex here: [http://aluigi.altervista.org/mytoolz.htm#both](http://aluigi.altervista.org/mytoolz.htm#both) (that's what I used for the long headers). But you don't need that for those short search terms as you normally don't search for hex code that's longer than 8 bytes.

Oh and please don't just quote everything when you're referring to just one tiny subject of the post...

Hehe that FileLoc in MultiEx Commander's MexScript used to be 

```
-------------------------------

This command searches the file from the current fileposition for a
<string> of max 40 length and saves the position (when found) in
<variable>. This way, if you know that a datafile contains only
a certain type of file with a set ID you can get the OFFSET of this
file that way. Just search for the ID and let MEX save its pos in FILEOFF.

```


in the DOS version in 1998.

Google solves the problem with .at3 files. Now KMPlayer play at3 files from Battle Fantasia, Puzzle Fighter and Street Fighter. Zhal no aa3 decoder(Tekken: Dark Resurrection).

> Sonic Ultimate Gensesis Collection is PS2 ADPCM (seemingly mono), starting at 0x40. Will implement that into my script soon.

There is none. SoundForge is pretty much the only possibility to decode them.

Alpha your rsf script problem might be multichannel related. in the file's header i see either 8 or 6 channels,but not 02 channels. I have converted a 2ch file and it worked. but when i converted a multichannel file the script still outputs the file as two channels and changing the channel count in the RIFF header doesn't work either.

I know that it doesn't read the channels because the standard atrac format only support stereo - or at least SoundForge only supports stereo files... I'm a bit confused of all these mono and multichannel atrac files. I currently don' know how to handle them, maybe there's a way to split the channels. Will try around with them some day.

math DAT += 4
goto DAT

putVarChr MEMORY_FILE 0x24 FREQ long
putVarChr MEMORY_FILE 0x31 CH byte
putVarChr MEMORY_FILE 0x38 SIZE long

append
log MEMORY_FILE OFFSET SIZE

Playstation ADPCM 0x10 bytes re-interleave
As the title says, this script de-interleaves a PS2 ss2 file and re-interleaves it with a 0x10 byte interleave. Apparently, the PS ADPCM plugin for vgmstream has a staggering problem with incomplete last interleave blocks. As those occur very often there's no other possibility than to re-interleave the files.
The new version 1.1 automatically deletes end silence (if the file has no stop marker). Next version will also remove silence of streams with different markers.
But another GREAT use for this script is the possibility of joining segments with different interleaves with the little script below that deletes the 0x28 size headers. 
What I normally do to join files on Windows 7:
- select all files I want to join
- press F2 (rename)
- write down a single name and press Enter (Windows 7 will automatically number the files)
- use Flexible Renamer (google it!) to rename the files to the format [name].001, [name].002 and so on
- use 7zip or WinRAR to join the files
Afterwards you can just re-add a correct SS2 header with my other script.
Of course this is also very practical to split ss2 files practically everywhere. =)

```

Hello alpha just a suggestion on your stereo XMA header script,is it possible to add an offset option so you can specify the offset of the xma stream for xma files with custom non riff headers?

I've heard someone asked for something that would make Call Of Duty:Black Ops(PC) .wav's valid, so I made something (apologies if it has already been made). The tool can extract and automatically fix wavs coming from COD:BO .iwd files, just drag them in the .exe and you will get in about 4-5 minutes valid .wavs (readme is included with the download).

Hey alpha does the search string for your general script have to be strictly 8 bytes? because when i try to do lower like 6 or 4 it just outputs the same archive from the first search string offset.

You need to adjust the += value down there to the length of your search string.

You can use QuickBMS scripts also in MultiEx Commander now that acts as a GUI.

For your information, MultiEx Commander used to be freely downloadable since 1997, so about 14 years. The only reason users are asked for a small donation is to ensure the continuation of the free information at XeNTaX. 

Second, "I want" is a disrespectful attitude towards those people that work in their freetime to support new formats, such as the one you aim for. And they do this for free. And guys like you probably have no sense of the cost of things. You probably expect everything to be free, heck perhaps even demand stuff to be free. 

Like I said in my post above, you can now *also* use QuickBMS scripts in MultiEx Commander, if you feel like having a GUI to preview files you extract, and extract only those files you wish to extract. The free - original command line- option is described by AlphaTwentyThree.

You can rename a huge number of files at once by setting a specific mask in Total Commander (or maybe other file managers but personally I prefer Total Commander). Once you cut music.pck in pieces with a help of Alpha23`s script you can highlight all the resulting files in Total Commander, go to "Files => Multi-rename tool" and change extension mask from [E] to RIFX. But if you`re not content with using paid software at all you can always rename them manually  .

Putting .rifx at the end of my files in windows doesn't seem to work, it just gives me a 1kb .ogg file. It's just that I don't wish to pay for anything I'm likely to use only once ever. Sorry if it looked disrespectful when I said it last time.

That would be something like MP2 to MP3... the formats are pretty different and I only program header manipulators but no converters. So, no. :-\

I`ll try to follow your actions step by step skipping BMS script phase.
You have roughly 100 files without an extension but you rename them so that all of them have RIFX extension;
You download that Wwise RIFF OGG vorbis conversion program;
You unpack WW2OGG.ZIP in the directory containing *.RIFX;
You put this text
for %%a in (*.RIFX) do ww2ogg.exe "%%a"
in a notepad and save it as *.BAT in the directory already containing WW2OGG program files and SVR 2011 tracks;
You run the batch file and should find standard and easily playable OGG files in that folder after conversion.

I had 100% success. Thanks guys for the prompt support you gave me. It was .ogg I was supposed to rename them to in Windows. A RIFX converter script gave me the instructions rename to .ogg before putting it into the ogg converter, so I did that and got the inners.

Oh lol, I didn't read properly, gg. I'll try to although I'm not sure if the values that are unprocessed in the RIFF header are important for the PS3 or PSP to play them. I'll code one later and you tell me if it works, ok?

Hope that helps, Orange

For your script to work on a headerless at3Plus you must remove the junk data from the headerless file,like the ones found when you extract the avi and at3 file from a PMF file Look at the hex in this at3 file find and remove the HEX:- 0FD0285C00000000 (i think this 128kbps)
There are 854 in this at3 file,i use a hex editor to find and replace but it takes forever to search each file ;(


So if you could add this to the script to search and remove the hex 0FD0285C00000000 from each at3 headerless file then add the aa3 header this will work!!

Hope this helps

Not for all headerless AT3+ files I think. Nevertheless, just use my PMF_at3_to_aa3 script, that does exactly that.

Adds a standard aa3 header to a headerless file.
Code: Select all.
.
.
savepos DATA
get SIZE asize
math SIZE -= OFFSET
math SIZE -= 4
.
.
.
string NAME += ".aa3"
math SIZE += 0x460

math SIZE += 4 # <--- add this line

log NAME 0 SIZE MEMORY_FILE

just a quick note that the currently posted version seems to trim the last 4 bytes off the file.  Adding the line of code should fix it.

Hi,
I've used your at3_to_aa3+smpl.bms script on Hokuto Musou at3 files, and it works like a charm!

As I'd like to add original anime BGM music back to the game, upon I've saved those in .aa3, how can I go convert them to at3 to be played into PS3?

Thanks!

WAVE format scanner
I already posted this inside some other topic but I'll include it here, too. Simple wave scanner. Doesn't search for the "RIFF" string as I once accidentially found it inside some other data structures where it wasn't a wave file. Instead it searches for the WAVEfmt part and extracts the file.Code: Select allfor i = 1
   FindLoc OFFSET STRING "WAVEfmt" 0 ""
   if OFFSET != ""
      math OFFSET -= 8
      goto OFFSET
      FindLoc DATA STRING "data" 0 ""
      math DATA += 4
      goto DATA
      get SSIZE long
      savepos HEADER
      math HEADER -= OFFSET
      set SIZE HEADER
      math SIZE += SSIZE
      get NAME basename
      string NAME += "_"
      string NAME += i
      string NAME += ".wav"
      log NAME OFFSET SIZE
   else
      cleanexit
   endif
next i
Thank you!
Sorry for my English... It is not my native language.
Can you make a script for flashing these wav files back to the original file? It would be great for mods.

These are just PS2 ADPCM streams with a fake AT3 header. Just use this simple script below on them and play them with the vgmstream plugin (Winamp). 
As you can see, the script only an altered version of the SS2 header adder script with some "get" commands to retrieve the fitting parameters. Anyone can adjust my scripts like that - I use that method all the time because it's so easy.   

```
goto 0x16
get CH short

Hello Alpha is it possible to make like a file cutter script based by on the filesize and not in any search string?

7zip can already do that - QuickBMS would be much slower.

Thanks, Will try that.

Also does your file deinterleave script work for blocked files?

EDIT: NVM it worked great on that interleaved atrac3 file from full auto 2 i posted here, 0x6000 itnelreaved with 8 streams, end of the track screwes up a bit though.

Updated my deinterleave script - there was something really wrong with it... 
It's now able to write working last blocks!

Wow now i can rework my full auto 2 rip, Thanks!

EDIT: Nope it still messing up on this file. 

[http://sharebee.com/5f4b495d](http://sharebee.com/5f4b495d)

EDIT: After taking another look it is not your script, it works correctly. It is the file that something is wrong, i Manually splitted the segments and it seems the ending segments are messed up.

The above script didn't work right in some cases so I changed it. Also added the mono/stereo option to the script AND to the addXMAheader.bms! 
Also, when any script here doesn't work, please help me improve the scripts and upload the according file here.

merge_mono_xadp.bms
Merges two mono Xbox ADPCM files of the same length to one stereo file. Encountered this when splitting and re-merging multichannel Xbox ADPCM files in "Disney's Cars 2: The Video Game". Each multichannel stream contains eight channels and has interleave 0x2. So deinterleaving will result in 8 mono files. As the streams actually consist of four layers, I needed to join two channels each layer. This is the script I used.
Note 1: Each file already needs to have an Xbox ADPCM header and the extension ".xadp" for the script to work 
Note 2: The script will take very long to run, so don't wonder. :-\
Note 3: Resulting files may be decoded with toWAV or renamed to *.wav and played in vgmstream (I found out that toWAV decodes the stream with higher quality - don't know why)
Note 4: The PC and PS3 version of Driver: San Francisco uses an Xbox ADPCM variant that hides behind a 0x02 code identifier (a quick look at the character distribution reveals the true codec  ). The files are 0x24-byte-interleaved mono Xbox ADPCM files and need to be transformed to xadp. So they just need deinterleaving, adding headers and joining the channels with the below script. 

```

set NAME1 NAME
string NAME1 += "L.xadp"

	append
endfunction
```


P.S.: To join multiple mono streams, use this batch file:

```
for %%i in (*L.xadp) do quickbms merge_mono_xadp.bms "%%i" "%CD%"
```

Hi there. It's me again from last year. This time I'm after the plugin to detect what the extension is for any Wii ADPCM file so I can put the .whatever onto the end of the file to play it in Winamp VGM Stream.

A Wii ADPCM to Normal ADPCM converter script would be equally as helpful as an extension detection script as long as it keeps the quality of the Wii ADPCM original that's fine with me.

Here is a Wii ADPCM from the game we are trying to get the music from this year so you can make either of the scripts to help us out.

I'm afraid nothing of the above is possible. I haven't found a way to play Wii ADPCM files myself...

RIFF/RIFX to unparsed XMA
Converts any RIFF or RIFX file that contains XMA data to a headerless and presumably unparsed XMA file with frequency and channels included in the name. Parsing and/or adding a header is pretty easy now, especially when processing multiple files.
Edit: now also with cue marker extraction. 

```
# transforms xma streams with RIFF or RIFX header to headerless XMA streams (*.uxma)
# output files have the format "<name>@FREQ[m/s].uxma"
# resulting files can be parsed if necessary
# a valid XMA header can be added with my header_adder_XMA.bms
# 
# cue markers are saved as <name>.cue
# they can be applied to the decoded wave files with my wave cue adder

- Post Title: Re: My quickBMS scripts

Corrected the XMA header adder. The script stopped with an error message when no frequency was given in the file name... Works fine now with all uxma files.
Next step is to enhance the script with the new external exe execution feature (xxx) of QuickBMS:
automatically parse headerless xma files if the source is XMA2, automatically parse multichannel files correctly and add headers to each stereo stream. Need to include some (brute-force) blocksize detection for this.
enhance the RIFF_to_uxma script to something like XMA_to_XMA (input: xma or xma2 file with RIFF or RIFF header, output: decodable xma file or multiple stereo files respectively)
eventually an XMA scanner that automatically extracts and transforms xma streams out of an archive.
The last script will be really exciting to program because there are quite a few things to mind like the pure stream size detection via xma_parse.
Stay tuned for updates.

Armored Core V Xbox 360 (bdt/bht)
Extracts the big archive from the new Armored Core V.  Only the name crcs are given, no actual file names. There seem to be groups of files, each group has a number of files associated although the file groups have no apparent meaning after extraction. You may adjust the script for your desires like only having the file number at the end of the file name. It's stored in the FNUM variable which isn't used in the below script but as I already included it to check the file count I thought I just keep it unused if anyone needs it.   
note: there are file types that can't be detected by their start. Those won't have any extension after the extraction.
UPDATE: externalized the type identification - use func_getTYPE.bms now!

Function: convert number to hex string
As the new version of QuickBMS supports external functions (YAY!!!), here's an example. Save the below code as num2hex.bmsf. Accessing the function works by adding the line 
```
include "num2hex.bmsf"
```
 to the start of your script.
The number you want to convert has to be named TOHEX. When you call the function (callfunction num2hex 1), the resulting hex string is saved in the same variable.

```
	strlen LENGTH TOHEX
	if LENGTH == 8
		string TOHEX p= "0x%08x" TOHEX
	elif LENGTH == 7
		string TOHEX p= "0x%07x" TOHEX
	elif LENGTH == 6
		string TOHEX p= "0x%06x" TOHEX
	elif LENGTH == 5
		string TOHEX p= "0x%05x" TOHEX
	elif LENGTH == 4
		string TOHEX p= "0x%04x" TOHEX
	elif LENGTH == 3
		string TOHEX p= "0x%03x" TOHEX
	elif LENGTH == 2
		string TOHEX p= "0x%02x" TOHEX
	elif LENGTH == 1
		string TOHEX p= "0x%01x" TOHEX
	endif
endfunction
```

Nintendo DS SWAR extractor
Extracts *.swav files out of swar archives (WaveArc). Playable with vgmstream. I know that VGMTrans can export swar files to dls instrument collections but there are sometimes other *.swar files that either aren't used in the banks or are completely stand-alone e.g. when there's no bank/seq area in the sdat. Experienced in GemQuest: 4 Elements and 7th Dragon so far but there are surely many others.

```

IMPORTANT UPDATE:
Just had to update my sdat extractor because there seem to be sdat files where the area with the file name pointers contains some unused information and the script searched for the name at the wrong offset. Fixed that problem with a little nasty work-around. Seems to work.

Nintendo DS bank.bin extractor
This extractor is for those NDS roms that only contain that one bank.bin file. There may be other formats to adjust the extension for and I'll update the script as soon as I find another game with this format.
Needs my func_getTYPE.bms to get file types.

```
# this is for NDS roms that only contain one single bin file
# supported games (more to come):
# - 1 vs 100
# - A Prendre ou A Laisser (FR)
# - Affari Tuoi (IT)
# - Dolphin Island: Underwater Adventures
# - Imagine: Teacher: Class Trip
# - Totally Spies! 3 - Sectet Agents
# 
# (c) 2012-03-19 by AlphaTwentyThree of XeNTaX

include "func_getTYPE.bms"
get ZERO long
get DATASTART long
set FILES DATASTART
math FILES -= 8
math FILES /= 8
for i = 1 <= FILES
	get OFFSET long
	get SIZE long
	get NAME basename
	string NAME += "_"
	string NAME += i
	callfunction getTYPE 1
	string NAME += EXT
	log NAME OFFSET SIZE
next i
```


Here's a guide how to get the music from these games:
I suppose you know how to extract *.nds roms, otherwise you wouldn't be here. 
1. Extract the bin file and locate the *.xm tracker files
2. Open all xm files with a hex editor
3. Scroll to the end of each xm file to locate the sample list. The samples are named "XMSMP_000.snd" up to a number you need to locate. They _should_ be sequentially named but don't be too sure about this. Look, how many samples occur in the xm files. Note that they start at zero, so if the highest sample is "XMSMP_030.snd", there are 31 samples in total.
4. Make a new folder and copy the above number of files from the end to that folder. These should only have the extensions *.dat or *.ez
5. You may need to decompress the *.ez files (as soon as somebody cracks the compression).
6. To keep track of the samples, rename them to the names needed (XMSMP_####.raw).
7. All the files are normally uncompressed PCM files. The frequency isn't given, so you should try some possibilities. So far I only encountered 11025 Hz mono 16bit, but there may be games which use others. Import the samples to any audio editor with the given specs. Save them as wav.
7. Open each xm file in Modplug Tracker and add as many samples as given in the sample list (check again via hex if you forgot). Import the wav samples from the xm sample list. IMPORTANT: keep the same order as in the list!
8. Save the file with Ctrl+S. Modplug Tracker will create an ImpulseTracker (*.it) file from the xm.

And another update for the SDAT extractor.
This time I encountered a file where the number of file pointers was excessively higher than the actual files (Ace Attorney Investigations: Miles Edgeworth). But as the pointer to the file name was zero in those cases, I could just add another if case.

As some of you may have noticed already, I've begun to update some scripts to function and stand-alone usage. If you're using my scripts, stay tuned, update the scripts and put them in a central location!
Just updated:
XMA RIFF header adder to func_XMA_header.bms
str2num function to func_str2num.bms
I'll post here whenever I've made an update.

Alpha23, could you update your SoundNode2XMA script to search for these XMA flags as well:

FC038000
FC03C001 - Usually Mono but can also be Stereo

Just encountered  a DS game where the main music isn't stored in the sound_data.sdat but in a Glob.bin that holds all other game files. As I guess that this format is used by other DS games I'll take a look at in the future I wrote this script. Took me unusually long because the needed information have to be gathered by workarounds.

func_getTYPE.bms

Ok, this post is extremely long overdue. When extracting files there's often no extension given, so I normally would test for the extensions that exist in the archive and just adjust a function at the end of the script. Lately I've run into too many GRAFs with no names or extensions and I think it's time to get some automation going here. 
I'll slowly update the below script with different heuristics as I encounter more and more file types. I know that there are file scanners for all kinds of types but I need this to determine the type inside MEMORY_FILE to adjust the extension on-the-fly. 
So you can go from

```
log NAME OFFSET SIZE
...
```

to

```
...
log MEMORY_FILE OFFSET SIZE
callfunction getTYPE 1
string NAME += EXT
log NAME 0 SIZE MEMORY_FILE
...
```

There's also the ZNAME variable which holds the filename in some file types (e.g. *.vag). Obviously, add

```
if ZNAME != ""
    string NAME += "_"
    string NAME += ZNAME
endif
string NAME += EXT
...
```
 for this (or just "set NAME ZNAME" if you want to leave out theID/CRC/TOC name).

Of course there are thousands of file types and many of them cannot be identified clearly, e.g. txt/inf/log/lua etc.

If you encounter any file type that isn't included in this script, just PM me and I'll see what I can do.

I guess that's something CRI specific but as always, I'm not sure until I find another game with this structure.
Also supports those *.snd files without a shd header file.
Note that it needs the func_getTYPE.bms!

if you decompress the xex file you should be able to spot the file table without much trouble.

convert XMA cue markers to WAVE cue marers
Wrote this one when I encountered XMA2 files with markers (Kinect Star Wars). The script takes the xma cue file, reads available information into an array and constructs a new cue file from scratch, including the ltxt section per marker. Conversion from big to little endian is also implemented.

I know that other games use this format, too but I need to find out how to automatically retrieve those variables behind the goto commands first. 
For now, you can use this just for one game. I'll update this post when I update the script.

Just updated my SS2 header adder to a more sophisticated script with the use of the include function. The old onw still works but this additionally has a memory preallocation and thus is multiple times faster. Practical when you batch big files.

rws_to_ss2.bms
Some PS2 games use the rws header. Those files can be played with vgmstream but the plugin doesn't take the name from the RWS header. My script does. 
This is a good example how easy header manipulations get with my adjusted func_header_SS2.bms!

CPK/SEG "FILM" audio extractor

While working on several older console games, I encountered this format first in Saturn, then in Sega CD games. The audio has no info, but there's some infor area after the block info, which is saved. Sometimes the audio is just Motorola (big endian) raw PCM, normally mono but I also encountered an audio format which I have never seen.
Used a workaround to pre-allocate the memory file, so it's pretty fast for bigger files, too.

```
# e.g. found in:
# - 3 Ninjas Kick Back (SCD)
# - Shellshock (SS)
# - Tomb Raider (SS)
# - X-Men: Children of the Atom (SS)
# (c) 2012-08-09 by AlphaTwentyThree of XeNTaX

get BIAS long
getDstring VER 4
get ZERO long
idstring "FDSC"
get STAB_OFF long
math STAB_OFF += 0x10
goto STAB_OFF

idstring "STAB"
get STAB_SIZE long
get UNK long
get ENTRIES long
savepos MYOFF
set OFF_HEADER ENTRIES
math OFF_HEADER *= 0x10
math OFF_HEADER += MYOFF
set SIZE_HEADER BIAS
math SIZE_HEADER -= OFF_HEADER

set PSIZE 0
for p = 0 < 2
	for i = 1 <= ENTRIES
		get OFFSET long
		math OFFSET += BIAS
		get SIZE long
		get UNK long
		get TYPE long
		if TYPE == 1 # audio
			if p == 0
				math PSIZE += SIZE
			else
				append
				log MEMORY_FILE OFFSET SIZE
				append
			endif
		endif
	next i
	if p == 0

Like the name tell you: just a header adder for standard wave pcm. Somehow I forgot to post it here.  
BTW: standard wave files have CODEC 1, BITS 16, but the BLOCKALIGN may vary between 1 and 4.

```
# input variables: SIZE, OFFSET, FREQ, CH, BITS, BLOCKALIGN, CODEC, NAME (or set to "")

	putvarchr MEMORY_FILE 0x28 SIZE long
	if NAME == ""
		get NAME basename

			string NAME += ".lwav"
		else
			string NAME += ".wav"
		endif
	endif
	get SIZE asize MEMORY_FILE
	log NAME 0 SIZE MEMORY_FILE
endfunction
```


Example script to add a header to a file:

```

math SIZE -= OFFSET

Alpha,
could you by any chance do a script for extracting towav-compatible xma from aux files (found in Kinect Disneyland Adventures)... I got the orchestral score from a former vgm rip, but I´d also like to extract the voice elements and park bgm from my disc...

Thanks a lot

That's no extraction, that's a complete manipulation. I don't remember the header of those aux files but I guess they have RIFF headers, so procedure is the same as always:
- strip the header with RIFF_to_uxma
- parse with xma_parse (if it doesn't work, try 0x10000 blocksize)
- add header with my script
Resulting files are decodable with toWAV.

thanks, alpha - i tried your method and it worked well, but only for a few files...

All of the aux files have a rifx wave fmt header or are bkhd files containing rifx wave fmt... Some of the files could be decoded with your method, some files got compatible for towav by just replacing the rifx header with a riff header in hex editor...
but on some of the files (like the one in the attached screenshot) i had no sucess with either method... There´s only digital noise after decoding it with towav... Perharps you could take a look on the file screenshots attached and give me a hint, what makes the left file so "special"...

thanks a lot...

Headhunter: Redemption (PS2) - *.DAT extractor
Unfortunately the file names are only saved as CRC so you have to post-process all files. 
Main videos and some music is in FSKOLME.DAT, sounds, music and cutscenes are in FSPIENI.DAT. VAG interleave i 0x1000 if you're wondering. 

If anyone can provide me with a sample of the Xbox version, I'd be happy to check if it works for this console, too.  PM me.

Hi alpha!

I am currently stuck trying to parse this particular XMA file from max Payne 3. Will Pm you the file 

As far as this structure goes, It appears to be a mono stream with dual channels blocked or interleave in a certain way. These blocked Intelreaved mono channels are also packed into packets separated by zeroes in the file. Some packets within a file have 2 channels in a packet but some have 12 channels. The first packet of every audio file has the mono XMA flag FC038000 which you can then identify and extract the channels easy of h first packet but the other packets don't have this flag and therefore have to find the interleaving. I tried to assume that the interleaving found in the first packet is the interleaving for all but such as not the case because when playing back the files it gives errors and the channels do not align right. So something is choking there. Hell im not even sure the FC038000 flag even states the correct interleaving in the first packet.

Didn't check on your scripts - thanks for the info. 
Is there an easy way to determine those crypt keys?

WAVE format scanner

Long overdue script for a proper wave scanner. I know there are many raw scanner which have a *.wav option but they only find very certain wave files. I've encountered none that supports big endian wave files with RIFX identifier so far.
My old script didn't work properly and I had to change almost the whole script. Features of this script:
supports little and big endian headers (RIFF and RIFX)
automatic filesize correction in header (!)
file name retrieval from first marker nameI've added comments about what happens in each line, so it's a nice example for getting familiar with QuickBMS. 

Tip: Scanning the EN.pck from Darksiders II (PC, 2012) will get you the original file names which aren't saved in the file table at the start of the archive! 

```
# RIFF and RIFX header supported
# note: There are wave files with a wrong file size after RIFF/RIFX
#       This script takes the stream size, adds the header size and writes the correct size after RIFF/RIFX
# (c) 2012-06-26 by AlphaTwentyThree
#
# future update plans:
# - option to also write data between found wave files to disk
# - option to automatically transform the file to a playable or at least decodable format

Will need to further compare this with the Quake 4 X360 version, maybe there's some identifier and I can join the two scripts.

The general problem with this format is that I couldn't find a way to calculate the OFF_INFO and had to manually set it to 0x15abc just for this one archive. So it won't work for any other .bf file.

Wave data reverser
Sometimes you encounter wave files that just play static but you can see that they are normal PCM files. Those are big endian streams with a little endian header. Normal process would be to strip the header, save the data as raw, open as big endian in an audio editor and save as PCM again. As this process can be pretty exhausting, I've written a little script that just reverses the wave data. The header stays untouched.
Note that the input has to be a standard PCM file with 4-byte block align.

```

idstring "RIFF"
do
	findLoc HEADER string "data" 0 ""
	goto HEADER
	idstring "data"
	get SIZE long
while SIZE == 0
math HEADER += 0x8

get SIZE asize
putVarChr MEMORY_FILE SIZE 0
log MEMORY_FILE 0 0
set LOOPS SIZE
math LOOPS -= HEADER
math LOOPS /= 2
append
log MEMORY_FILE 0 HEADER # write header
set OFFSET HEADER
goto OFFSET
for i = 1 <= LOOPS
	get WRITE short
	reverseShort WRITE
	putVarChr MEMORY_FILE OFFSET WRITE short
	math OFFSET += 2
next i
append
get NAME basename
string NAME += "_littled"
string NAME += ".wav"
log NAME 0 SIZE MEMORY_FILE

```

Enhanced WiiWare extractor
As I wasn't quite satisfied with the procedure to extract the contents of extracted WiiWare *.wad images, I wrote my own script. The basis is just a U-8 archive extractor, but it does more than just extract/decompress it's contents:
- it searches for a U-8 archive within a file, dumps the data before the found identifier and processes the U-8
- it analyzes the content of each file from the U-8 after dumping it into memory:
   -> if the data has an "LZ77" identifier, it automatically decompresses the contents
   -> if the data has an "IMD5" identifier, it looks for either a "BNS " (sound) or "LZ77" identifier. If the latter is found, it decompresses the content
- the above two steps also apply to files that are no U-8 archives but have these three identifiers.
If you have ever worked with WAD WiiWare images, you know that the process of extracting everything can be rather tedious. This script will fasten the process a bit. 
Just to get an idea what the potential is:
- when you extract the 00000000.app, the banner.bin, icon.bin and sound.bin are already decompressed. If the sound.bin wasn't compressed, it's already named sound.bin.bns and ready to be played in Winamp with the vgmstream input
- when you extract some other U-8 archive, all the contents will be fully decompressed, even if they start with the LZ77 identifier and not with 0x10/0x11.
- you can throw in LZ77-compressed files with either 0x10/0x11 or "LZ77" identifier and decompress them. Any found data with IMD5 identifier will be analyzed further.
- you can throw in files with "IMD5" identifier and the content will be decompressed.
So after all, this is quite a powerful script. 

```
# supported formats: U-8 archives, LZ77-compressed files ("LZ77" or 0x10/0x11 identifier) and files with "IMD5" identifier
# - if LZ77-compressed data is found in an IMD5 file within a U-8 archive or if the IMD5 file is the input, it is automatically decompressed
# - if a BNS sound file is found in a IMD5 file within a U-8 archive or if the IMD5 file is the input, it is automatically extracted
# - if the input is an LZ77-compressed file (all identifiers), it is decompressed and analyzed further with the above criteria

Just a little update on what I'm currently doing: I've encountered several *.brsar sound archives from WiiWare games now (the Bit.Trip series to be precise) and as there's currently no extractor available, I'm trying to write my own.  
The structure reminds of the *.sdat files from Nintendo DS games, but not as sophisticated. Still, it's no simple extraction because there are several sections with different infos (like in the SDATs). Additionally, the files are divided into RWAR packs, each containing numbers of files. I'm currently searching for a way to link the names to the files. I guess, there's some ID for every file and somewhere there are pointers from the offsets to the files. Else, I didn't yet figure out why there are more names than RWAV entries - they probably correlate to the pack names. Some analyzing to do but I think it'll be worth the effort and many games will be correctly rippable from then on!

Playstation XA extractor
This script splits deinterleaved XA files to playable XA files. 
To get a correctly deinterleaved XA files:
- raw-copy the big XA to your HD (i.e. with ISOBuster)
- open the file with a hex editor, set the jump parameter to 0x930, look at the byte at cursor +0x11, it will increase each 0x930 jump
- as soon as the counter reaches 00 again, you have your desired layer count (highest number plus one as the counting starts at zero) - always a power of two (normally either 0x4, 0x8 or 0x10)
- set your deinterleave parameters accordingly with INTERLEAVE 0x930 and the above layer count and deinterleave with my script or any program that can do this operation
Each of the deinterleaved files will be the same size of course and will contain a number of xa streams, which you can extract with this sript. Don't worry if the size of the extracted files is by far smaller than the size of the layer - that's because there's plenty of filling bytes and the main reason why PSX images can be compressed with such a high ratio.
I might extend this script to do all of the above steps automatically but I'm too lazy at the moment. 
As you can see, the script is just a simplified version of my generic file splitter. Remember to put the needed func_header_CDXA.bms into the same directory as this script.

```

Electronic Arts AST archive extractor (BGFA identifier)
For those big ast archives with BGFA identifier. Only tested with BGFA version 1.05, but enough work to figure out the format, which was quite a hazzle because the length of the variables varies between archives, which is really uncommon. 
No file names but if getTYPE doesn't recognize the type the internal type is used as an extension (although I'm not entirely sure if that's really the file type  ). If you encounter any ast archive that doesn't work with this script or if you need other extensions implemented, post here. I've only looked for extensions that the games I tested use.
Newest func_getTYPE.bms needed!

Hi AlphaTwentyThree,

Thanks so much for giving some attention to the EA .AST archives! I tried your AST script on NCAA Football '13 (XBOX360) and I'm having some errors extracting the files. 

"qkl_heisman1.AST" and "qkl_heisman2.AST" works great. They both spit out a bunch of .vp6 files. "qkl_interface.AST" spits out 618 smaller .AST files and a lot of system beeps. However,

"qkl_boot.AST" gives me the following error:

```
             <get MEMORY_FILE (27) "MEMORY_FILE"
             <get OFFSET (23) 0x00001890
             <get ZSIZE (25) 0x00000f92
             <get SIZE (26) 0x000037b3
- create a memory file from offset 00001890 of 14259 bytes

Error: the compressed zlib/deflate input is wrong or incomplete (-3)

Error: there is an error with the decompression
       the returned output size is negative (-1)

```


"qkl_fe2ig.AST" gives the same error:

```
             <get MEMORY_FILE (27) "MEMORY_FILE"
             <get OFFSET (23) 0x001abac4
             <get ZSIZE (25) 0x00000049
             <get SIZE (26) 0x0000005e
- create a memory file from offset 001abac4 of 94 bytes

Error: the compressed zlib/deflate input is wrong or incomplete (-3)

Error: there is an error with the decompression
       the returned output size is negative (-1)
```


"qkl_stream.AST" does the same with some added system beeps when it fails:

```
             <get MEMORY_FILE (27) "MEMORY_FILE"
             <get OFFSET (23) 0x092f3d60
             <get ZSIZE (25) 0x0000f551
             <get SIZE (26) 0x000c8c88
- create a memory file from offset 092f3d60 of 822408 bytes

Error: the compressed zlib/deflate input is wrong or incomplete (-3)

Error: there is an error with the decompression
       the returned output size is negative (-1)
```


For sanity's sake, I'm using quickbms.exe 0.5.13 in this manner: ">quickbms.exe -v ncaa.bms qkl_boot.AST outputfolder" where I named your script as ncaa.bms.

Any ideas of what I may have done wrong or how I can help you debug it?

Thanks!!

Does [http://wiki.multimedia.cx/index.php?tit ... er-Man_BIN](http://wiki.multimedia.cx/index.php?title=Amazing_Spider-Man_BIN) help any with this format?

Hm, well I got the same problem with the boot archive, but all the others worked fine. I don't have the image anymore so I can't research the problem with the boot file. There's one possibility though. You may change the script so that it doesn't try to decompress the files but just dumps the compressed files to disk and then use comtype_scan2 to figure out the compression used there. Another possibility could be that the script tries to decompress a file that isn't compressed, but then there would be something wrong with the script altogether. Maybe some variable length problem. That format basically just p***** me off. 
For your running question: I've linked *.bms files to open with QuickBMS, I don't use any options when running a script. Works fine for me that way.

Thanks Ekey, but same output from that command.

OK I tried this. I swapped this line:

```
clog MEMORY_FILE OFFSET ZSIZE SIZE
```


with

```
log MEMORY_FILE OFFSET ZSIZE
```


(I've tried SIZE instead of ZSIZE too, same output files)

qkl_fe2ig.AST and qkl_stream.AST both extracted into lots of files (with lots of system beeps!). I ran many of them through the comtype_scan2 and couldn't find anything that resembled a 4byte header in any of the output files. COMP_LZFU_RAW (#219) came the closest because the files had references to fonts (New Times Roman, Sans Serif, etc.) and colors (red, blue, etc.) in them in plain English, but no 4byte Header.

If I can help with this, would you take a peek at the fe2ig and stream files? I don't know which one the models and textures are in... that's all that I want.

I'm right there with ya!!!

Frustrated. What's the next step?

Just a small note on CDXA, there are actually XA files using 18,900khz stereo playback rates too than just 37,800Hz and 2 channels which is admittedly more common.

Like for example the PSX versions of C&C RA1.

As for ima adpcm header adder, you would need to add the various default block sizes as per each khz in default MS encoder.

mono
8khz/11khz/16khz= 256

22khz/32khz=512

44khz/48khz=1024

for stereo previous apply except double the block size so 8khz stereo=512

xbox adpcm uses always 36 mono or 72 stereo blocksizes regardless of khz but such small block sizes waste tons of space.

fact chunk can be left unwritten but the last field before it or data is sadly demanded by most players too except vlc.

OMG, thans a lot for all this information!!! I'll definitely look into implementing that! :):)
18,900khz stereo? Only encountered mono so far. Anyway, the header should be the same as channels and frequency isn't stated at all.

Darn, I was hoping the MSF converter update would successfully convert my msf's from Castlevania HoD (PS3) but it's giving me at3's that don't play and ss2's that give errors in MFAudio. ("Specified format is not supported or cannot be translated")

Here are some examples of msf's that I'm trying to convert if you have time to look at them.  [http://www.mediafire.com/?km5qeflgmzeep9j](http://www.mediafire.com/?km5qeflgmzeep9j)
And there are a bunch more I can provide if it interests you.

Just made a major update for my [CPK/SEG movie 'FILM' id audio extractor (Saturn/Sega CD)](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=13&p=71395#p71395).  The previous version eventually produced wrong results.

Welcome. Could you write a script that allows you to rework "PCM" to "msf"? or "PCM" to "AA3" and then "AA3" to "msf"? I really depend on that.

Thanks for possible help

Wave cue extractor and injector

Needed when decoding from non-standard wave headers to save the cue marker section. Can be imported with the second script later-on.
Very practical if you want to add comments to a compressed file, e.g. mp3 or ogg. Just take the decoded file, add your markers and export them. You can later on decode the compressed file again and inject the markers from before. Works with every marker type.
Also needed when working with rifx files from the Wwise system as RIFX files containing ogg streams can contain markers. So to get the markers to their correct positions, you just need to extract them from the original rifx, transform the rifx with ww2ogg and revorb, decode the ogg to wav and inject the cue markers again. 

Extractor:

```
# RIFF and RIFX header supported
# (c) 2012-08-16 by AlphaTwentyThree of XeNTaX

getDstring HEAD 4
if HEAD == "RIFX"
	endian big
endif

get NAME basename
string NAME += ".cue"

FindLoc OFFSET1 string "cue" 0 ""
if OFFSET1 != ""
	goto OFFSET1
	idstring "cue "
	get SIZE1 long
	math SIZE1 += 0x8
	set OFFSET2 OFFSET1
	math OFFSET2 += SIZE1
	goto OFFSET2
	getDstring LIST_test 0x4
	set SIZE SIZE1
	if LIST_test = "LIST"
		get SIZE2 long
		math SIZE2 += 0x8
		math SIZE += SIZE2
	endif
	set OFFSET OFFSET1
	log NAME OFFSET SIZE
endif
```


Injector:

```
# (c) 2012-08-16 by AlphaTwentyThree of XeNTaX


get NAME basename 0
string NAME += ".cueold"
FindLoc OFFSET string "cue " 0 ""
if OFFSET != ""
   get SIZE asize 0
   math SIZE -= OFFSET
   log NAME OFFSET SIZE
else
   get SIZE asize
endif
log MEMORY_FILE 0 SIZE
open FDDE CUE 1
get CSIZE asize 1
append
log MEMORY_FILE 0 CSIZE 1
append
get NAME filename  0
math SIZE += CSIZE
set RIFFSIZE SIZE
math RIFFSIZE -= 8
putVarChr MEMORY_FILE 4 RIFFSIZE long
log NAME 0 SIZE MEMORY_FILE

Unity3D Engine *.assets extractor

Couldn't find an extractor anywhere, so I wrote my own.  Long overdue but wasn't motivated enough to go through the pain of the format. 
If you experience any problems, pm me and I'll take a look. The outsorted file types are only the ones I found.
Else, if anyone can identify some of the missing extensions, I'd be grateful!

lateste updates:
- if type 49 contains png or xml, it is recognized and the size adjusted
- included variant with file tale at the end (some resources.assets use those)
- mp3 detection included

XOR test

Just writes the first 2KB of a given file with 1 < XOR < 256 to determine the needed setting for a future parser more easily. You can change the setting if you want to.
Exremely simple script practically not really worth posting - but for those who are totally lost, get it here. 

```
	filexor i
	get NAME basename
	string NAME += "_xor"
	string NAME += i
	log NAME 0 0x1000

Dark Souls bdt/bhd5 extractor

This is the same type of archive than the one used in Armored Core V, just little endian. Somehow I got an error with the old script minus the "endian big", so I wrote a new one which works.

```

file deinterleaver (new version)

Split files into alternating blocks of the same size. Used when manipulating audio formats with more than one channel. E.g. stereo wave streams have an interleave of 2 bytes, i.e. each two bytes the channel information switches 2xL,2xR,2xL and so on. The blocksize of this structure would be 4 (two times the interleave size). If the stream has four channels, the interleave would stay at 2, but the blocksize would be 8. So if you split the channels you need to deinterleave the file and this script does exactly that, according to the parameters you set.
Additionally you can specify a SKIP variable, which denotes an area at the start of each block not to process during the deinterleaving. A good example is the "disguised" Playstation ADPCM format in some Electronic Arts PS2 games, where some dummy marker is set each block. So, just set the layer count to one and adjust the SKIP variable.

This is an extremely powerful script! Play around with different files to get the idea what you can do with this. Most common use is channel splitting, but you can do all kinds of adjustments to your files. Easiest example would be to split audio formats into mono channels, splitting multichannel files into stereo pairs or deleting regularly occurring chunks of data inside a file.

This is a long overdue update of my [old deinterleave script](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=13&p=39344#p39344), which was rather cryptic and above all really really slow. This new one boosts the running time x300 and has some additional options:
- you can choose to add the original header to the deinterleaved files
- the header can be manipulated
- the variables are now better to understand (just header, blocksize, interleave size, layer and skip)

UPDATE 2016-05-16

The script now supports incomplete last blocks! 


Here's a little example

Source file:
- header of 0x10 bytes
- four channels
- 4 byte dummy each 0x14 bytes
- you want to split the channels and know that one complete block is 0x14 bytes

Variables to set:
- HEADER 0x10
- SKIP 4
- LAYERS 4
- BLOCKSIZE 0x14 (alternatively BLOCKSIZE 0 and INTSIZE 4)
- to add the original header to each deinterleaved file, set PRESERVE to 1
- leave ADJUST at 0 if you're not familiar with QuickBMS

Let's say we have the same file, but the dummy occur for every channel interleave block. Then we have to run the script two times:
- first run, delete the dummy bytes: HEADER 0x10, PRESERVE 1, SKIP 4, LAYERS 1, BLOCKSIZE 0, INTSIZE 0x14 (or BLOCKSIZE 0x50) -> produces one smaller file
- second run, deinterleave channels: HEADER 0x10, PRESERVE 1, SKIP 0, LAYERS 4, BLOCKSIZE 0x40 (or 0 and INTSIZE 0x10) -> produces four files which are exactly 1/4th of the above file

```

# notes:
# HEADER - area which is untouched by the deinterleaving
# PRESERVE 0/1			-	set to 1 to write the skipped area from 
#            				HEADER to each deinterleaved file
# ADJUST 0/1 			- 	if the header needs to be adjusted, set 
#              				this to 1 and write your code to the function 
#              				"adjustheader" at the end of this script
# SPLIT_LAST_BLOCK 0/1	-	set to 1 to split an incomplete last block equally 
#							between layers. If set to 0, the script will ter-
#							minate if it finds an incomplete last block.
#							HANDLE WITH CARE!
# BLOCKSIZE 			-	size of one complete interleave block 
# LAYERS				-	the numbers of (equal-sized) files you want 
#							to deinterleave to
# SKIP					-	number of bytes to skip at the start of each block

# split channels of Playstation ADPCM file: # HEADER 0x2c, PRESERVE 1, ADJUST 1 (adjust function), BLOCKSIZE 2*Interleave, SKIP 0

Just corrected the at3_to_aa3 script. Seemed to have some serious mistake... Also added pre-allocation although you'll probably only notice the difference when converting large amounts of at3 files.

Alpha pertaining to your updated deinterleaving script would there be a possible option to add a scanning function to determine if the file's interleave possibly changes to another interleave cycle and the option can also print out the offset where we would need to cut the file segment with the new interleave?

How should that work? There's absolutely NO way to determine such an extremely generic thing automatically.

Your right.

Oh well maybe it can Print out the difference in size if its not divisible by the given blocksize/interleave?

Sure, just add %TEST% somwhere inside the two error print commands.

The script for the Unity3D engine was somewhat faulty, so I made some major updates: [viewtopic.php?f=13&t=4450&p=77959#p77959](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=13&t=4450&p=77959#p77959)
I'm not sure about the internal "type", this could also be some folder because e.g. type 49 contains various types of files. Inside the script you find a list of types I've encountered so far and as I'm no specialist in this and don't recognize certain types, it would be cool if you contribute here and tell me some of the types I haven't adjusted the extraction process yet.

Raw Activision BAF extractor

This script will just append the data to the header info at the start of the baf archive and write it to disk for post-processing. This is practical if the audio format can't e played yet but you want to extract the baf files nevertheless, e.g. Sony ADPCM variant from 007: Blood Stone (PC).

```
# this script only extracts the raw data from baf files (header, cue markers, stream data)
# to be used for later post-processing of the contained audio files (saved as *.wavl)

Turok: Evolution *.tre extractor

This doesn't look so special, but believe me, it was really some hazzle to figure out the format because the files in the TOC are sorted by file crc and din't have any names. I ran many many tests - and finally found a file with the file names (sorted by offset, so the new sortarray function came it pretty handy  ) 
This is a script I'm really really proud of! 
(Just for your info: The old script from some years only extracted the files without names.)

```
# note: CORRECT NAMES!!!
# (c) 2012-10-02 by AlphaTwentyThree of XeNTaX

get FILES long
for i = 0 < FILES
	get OFFSET long
	get SIZE long
	get DATA_CRC long
	get NAME_CRC long
	putArray 0 i OFFSET
	putArray 1 i SIZE
next i
print "sorting array"
sortarray 0 1
getArray NAMEOFF 0 2
goto NAMEOFF
for i = 0 < FILES
	getCT NAME string 0x0d
	get DUMMY byte
	getArray OFFSET 0 i
	getArray SIZE 1 i
	log NAME OFFSET SIZE
next i
```

Just for completeness' sake, here's the version for archives where no names are given. Note that sorting is still needed. Needs the newest func_getTYPE.bms (see link list)

```
# note: for the main STREE.TRE use my other script!
# (c) 2012-10-02 by AlphaTwentyThree of XeNTaX

Find the updated script here: [viewtopic.php?f=13&t=4450&p=77959#p77959](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=13&t=4450&p=77959#p77959) =)

Electronic Arts *.big extractor

I know there are many different archives in use by EA - this is one of them at least (identifier "BE"). For the PC version, just delete the "endian big" - I guess. 
Nice example for the use of the array, which comes in quite handy here. Thanks Luigi for the implementation of the chunklzx unpack function.

The Amazing Spider-Man *.pkz decompressor

Decompresses the pkz archives from the game and writes the header and decompressed data to disk. I can't make any sense of the given offsets in the header, but if anyone wants to take a look, I can provide a sample.
Nothing special here, so again, it's just another example for the QuickBMS-curious (comments provided). 

```
# no extraction of individual files at the moment (TOC offsets don't fit)
# (c) 2012-10-09 by AlphaTwentyThree of XeNTaX

comtype zlib_noerror
get IDENT long
if IDENT == 0xb0b1bEbA
	endian big
elif IDENT == 0xbabeb1b0
else
	cleanexit
endif
get DATA_OFF long              # start of compressed data
get NAME basename
string NAME += ".header"
log NAME 0 DATA_OFF            # write header to disk for later research
get BLOCKSIZE long             # length of one zlib block
get LOOPS asize                # calculate the number of loops
math LOOPS -= DATA_OFF
math LOOPS /= BLOCKSIZE
# memory pre-allocation
get SIZE asize
math SIZE -= DATA_OFF
math SIZE *= 10
putVarChr MEMORY_FILE SIZE 0
log MEMORY_FILE 0 0
set OFFSET DATA_OFF  # initialize first offset
set SIZE BLOCKSIZE
math SIZE *= 10      # set decompressed size to some default
append
for i = 1 <= LOOPS
	clog MEMORY_FILE OFFSET BLOCKSIZE SIZE # decompress block to memory
	math OFFSET += BLOCKSIZE               # jump to next block
next i
append
get NAME basename
string NAME += ".decomp"
get SIZE asize MEMORY_FILE
log NAME 0 SIZE MEMORY_FILE
```

Found a quite stupid mistake in my generic splitter which I won't explain any further.

I have a feeling that there's some better way to do this (since, according to my understanding, it's basically just a ceil() function with a custom "cutoff"), but my maths isn't strong enough to pick it out (I think bit-shifting would play a role, though... does QuickBMS actually support bit-wise manipulations?). =/

Of course, I'm an idiot; "ceil() with a custom 'cutoff'" is just a rounding function. =D

Wwise sound engine *.pck/AKPK extractor

Finally had the motivation to write a (hopefully) working script for this format now. Most games that use the Wwise engine also use that format - which applies to tons of games from the '10 era.
Sadly, the names are only saved as a CRC value. :-\
Be sure to grab the newest func_getTYPE.bms, I've changed some basic things regarding the detection of RIFF/RIFX-headered files. Detects xWMA, ms_adpcm, ima_adpcm, xbox_adpcm and Wwise ogg now.

Just updated the above script and added PC version support (little endian). Not quite sure if it works, it's just a workaround. Just try it on some files to check. At least it works for the PC version of Borderlands 2...

Updated the func_getTYPE.bms once more.  Added five or six new types and corrected a stupid mistake that sometimes prevented it from working correctly.

Added X360 support to the bdt/bht5 extractor. I don't know if the switch between offset and 4byte zero is connected to the endianness. I'd need other games to check this with.

I heart you AlphaTwentyThree! I haven't check this in months thinking that you may have given up on it, but lo and behold! It finally extracts all of the BIG .AST files! Out of curiosity, is there a recursive function to extract the resultant .ast files from the big one?

Yes I greatly appreciate you putting more time into this one!

Unfortunately, the output isn't quite usable yet... no 3d models or textures. There are a lot of additional .AST files that get spewed out from the big ones. Trying to extract those results in more .AST files. If you keep extracting them, you essentially see a pattern where the results are the same as all of the .AST files in the top level directory. So a tiny .AST file could extract into many many .AST files that are much larger than the tiny one that you started from which includes a copy of itself. (That sounds a little wordy to me, hopefully it makes sense!)

Some thoughts on some of the resultant file types:

Any idea what the .XPR files are? I tried your Quake 4 XPR bms script, but it didn't work (couldn't read 1 byte).

You mention in the func_getTYPE.bms that you are unsure of the usage of .GD files. Looking at them in a hex editor, they look like animation scripts of some sort. They contain some variable declarations and then mention animation parameters. I'm sure that you've already looked at that though, but just in the odd case that you haven't... maybe that could help diagnose their usage?   

I heart you AlphaTwentyThree!

Well, to check this phenomenon I'd need something that only you have on your HDD... all those AST files that is. I wrote the script for one game and it seemed to work ok, so I didn't bother anymore. :-\

UPDATE

I just made some corrections in the Wwise pck/AKPK script. 
- doesn't terminate in an error message
- supports those pck files with only one folder (sfx)
- added sub-folders with the archive name inside the internal folder names (to identify where a certain language file came from)
The PC support was only some really uncertain work-around and made the script extremely messy, so I've deleted that for now. Will add the correct lines as soon as I get my hands on a sample.

Works if .pck archives dont have much files. Problem .pcks - sounds_eng.pck, sounds_sfx.pck (Assasin`s Creed III (Xbox 360)). QuickBMS error - this BMS script uses more array elements than how much supported (0.5.15b).
Dont work with soundstream.pck (Halo 4) - dont do extracting (extracted 0 files from 0).

You'll need the newest func_getTYPE.bms for this to work properly. Note that some files remain zlib-compressed after extraction. They have been compressed two times in a row and this script doesn't extract recursively. They all contain *.pif files.

Try use Playstation XA extractor on XA_STR from japan version 1.0 of Castlevania: Symphony of the Night, but its dont work. Maybe because, in this file contain some SEQ files(PS1 MIDI).

Well, these are .VAB archives with PS2 ADPCM streams inside. Can't remember if I ever wrote an extractor for these. ATM I don't have time but for all I can see at first glance the format isn't complicated.

Glacier engine - WHD/WAV pairs

Games like the Hitman series, Freedom Fighters or Kane & Lynch. You will need to put all whd/wav pairs as well as the streams.wav (if available) into the same folder.
Not all tested, though. So if you have problems with any of the Glacier games, post here.

Simple audio file sorter

This could come in helpful when you rip a game with the Wwise engine and have thousands of files but don't know what type of sound the file is (music, sfx, ambience, speech etc.).
Just run all the files through the script, it will sort them according to their frequency and channels. Will save you a LOT of time when it comes to music processing!
Also: Good script for beginners. 

```
if IDENT == "OggS"
	goto 0x27
	get CH byte
	get FREQ short
elif IDENT == "RIFF"
	goto 0x16
	get CH short
	get FREQ long
endif
get FNAME filename
string NAME p= "%d_%d/%s" FREQ CH FNAME
get SIZE asize
log NAME 0 SIZE
```

UPDATE

Just updated my generic file splitter with an additional option that makes it a generic filetype scanner (!!!).
Funny thing is that it was really easy to implement, I just didn't see the obvious.

// 1) Read bytes 0x10-0x13, store as num_files[]
// 2) Go to 0x30-0x33, store files_start_offset[], jump to files_start_offset[]
// 3) For each item in num_files[]
// 4) Read first four bytes as file_offset[]
// 5) Read next four bytes as file_size[]
// 6) Jump forward 12 bytes
// 7) Read 16 bytes as file_name[]
//  Go to file_offset[]
// 9) Select from file_offset[] to file_offset[]+file_size[]
// 10) Save selection as file_name[]
// 11) num_files[]+=1
// 12) files_start_offset[]+=84 bytes
// 13) fetch next

I'm getting an error, it may be my problem:

```
Error: incomplete input file number 0, can't read 4 bytes.
```


Here's the offsets 0x10 and 0x30, maybe I'm reading those wrong, are those the correct addresses.



***EDIT***

Here's the basic file structure: [http://wiki.xentax.com/index.php?title= ... Apocalypse](http://wiki.xentax.com/index.php?title=X-Men_Legends_2_-_Rise_Of_Apocalypse) -- I'm just getting "Number Of Items In Directory 1", then "Offset To Directory Data 3". From there I would grab the data I need (offset, size, name), then jump to the actual files. I can manually rip them, but it's hundreds of files. 

Incidentally, directories 4-7 in the wiki don't actually exist in the files. I'm not sure if anyone can edit that data or not.

Sorry to ask but why do you need a BMS script when Game Extractor already supports the archive type?

It doesn't, though. Supposedly it does, but the table structure is platform-specific, so GameExtractor can only do one platform. A QuickBMS script would allow me to adjust sizes and offsets should I ever need to. The Unknown{4} in the // Directory Data 3 is a different size on each platform. For example, the 360 is 12 bytes instead of 4.

Any chance you'll ever be able to figure this out so we can have some modding scene go on for these games. So many of their Spiderman games use PKZ and so many costumes that could be ported now into each game now. Surprised no one has figured this out yet. Since ASM2 just came out recently and nothing seems to have changed.

Hey A23!

Thank you so much for your time and effort 

I am a little stuck and maybe you can help?

When I run your great qBMS script, I am able to extract:
XMA - Which I have already used your other great XMA decoder script for ToWav and works greatDDS - All of the textures are great and works a treat

The only problem is that there are no 3D model files extracted  I can see there are a lot of '.000000xx' files, which I presume some are the model files.

How can I go about exploring these files to see?

Thanks so much!

Well, you could look at them using a hex editor but you probably have to write your own conversion script to access them with a 3D program. As I'm neither familiar with nor interested in model files I wish you luck with your quest.

Decompresses the pkz archives from the game and writes the header and decompressed data to disk. I can't make any sense of the given offsets in the header, but if anyone wants to take a look, I can provide a sample.
Nothing special here, so again, it's just another example for the QuickBMS-curious (comments provided).

Any chance you'll ever be able to figure this out so we can have some modding scene go on for these games. So many of their Spiderman games use PKZ and so many costumes that could be ported now into each game now. Surprised no one has figured this out yet. Since ASM2 just came out recently and nothing seems to have changed.

on THE AMAZING SPIDER MAN 2 is not working
plz new code

Another good example for the use of external scripts.Something wrong with that. What i did wrong? (SPEECH .DAT/.TAB extracted with CDmage from the SLUS_004.84)

- start the scanning of the input folder: E:\!BS\New folder
- open input file E:\!BS\New folder\.\SPEECH.DAT
- open script E:\!BS\BS.bms

Error: invalid command "if" or arguments -1 at line 25

Press RETURN to quit

Games like the Hitman series, Freedom Fighters or Kane & Lynch. You will need to put all whd/wav pairs as well as the streams.wav (if available) into the same folder.
Not all tested, though. So if you have problems with any of the Glacier games, post here.

Okay, I have opened textures from NBA Jam on fire edition in photoshop. used xbox sdk kit to finally extract the tga files, and then bundle them back together to xpr2. This makes an xpr2 file with the same name, etc. I tried placing all the files, but the game freezes when loading a match an looking for the textures, it appears it WANTs the .AST file. 
NOW, I can someone please help me run this NBA extraction script in reverse to make an ast?  I tried running itin quickbms with the Reimport batch, but it errored saying expected BGFA, this file is XPR2. The script worked to Extract the files, now I need to inject them or re-import them to .ast ... Please help me run this script in reverse and my project is complete.

So, I tried your "EA ast extractor" script on an .ast file that I discovered on an Wii game developed by EA. however, it gave me this error:


Maybe it's an undiscovered .ast file. Here's an sample:
[https://mega.nz/#!AM9XhJrJ!O11IMx0eLYqG ... 5_ucY8BZjU](https://mega.nz/#!AM9XhJrJ!O11IMx0eLYqGp-Wt8dhdhxrefAAq8Oe9p5_ucY8BZjU)

See if you can figure this out.

Your Half-Life PS2 .pak extracting script only works on certain PAK files, others don't have the PAK header, maybe because they are compressed? Anyone know how to decompress/extract VALVE.PAK for example?

I know there are many different archives in use by EA - this is one of them at least (identifier "BE"). For the PC version, just delete the "endian big" - I guess. 
Nice example for the use of the array, which comes in quite handy here. Thanks Luigi for the implementation of the chunklzx unpack function.

Thank you very much. This script works perfectly with the UFC 2 archives on the ps4.

I was wondering if you or anyone can make an extractor for the .sdt audio archives of the Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban console versions along with a parser that gives the results proper file names. The names are located in the .ids files.

sdu extractor for "The Suffering" (Xbox)
Uses my new version of the Xbox ADPCM header adder, so be sure to update that!

Remember to decode the *.lwav files with toWAV because the vgmstream playback is errornous!

Does anybody know how to extract the .sdu and .vdu archives from the PC version of the game? I tried this script here but it didn't extract anything so my guess is, it only works with the Xbox version.

After digging some more I also found this:
[http://wiki.xentax.com/index.php/Surrea ... ot_Engine)](http://wiki.xentax.com/index.php/Surreal_Software_Archive_%28Riot_Engine%29)

I tried the Drakan bms script on it and it did work, however, I end up with a bunch of .dat, .ico and .img files. My guess is that the audio stuff is in some of these .dat files but I found no way to open/extract/playback them yet.

Does anybody here know anything by chance? I could just use the Xbox version but from my experience the Xbox audio codec is often inferior and sounds bad especially in the hights.

I'm not coding anymore. Given the age of the game, they mostly used mp3 for music. It's actually inferior to the native Xbox codec (a really good ADPCM). After all, it's the direct pre-decessor of WMA.

Yeah, you could be right. I have a feeling that this BMS script doesn't even work properly on these files. I also end up with many 1kb files that just seem to be corrupt. Some files do seem to contain data but this seems to be only voice acting and video audio. I was able to import these in Audacity with the raw audio import option but couldn't find anything else out. Their header doesn't seem to be recognized by anything except rarely as rare video codec. I also didn't find any music so far so my guess is, it doesn't even get extracted and I extracted multiple .sdu and .vdu files already. The PC version of The Suffering just doesn't seem to be extractable right now, only the Xbox version with your script. If nothing else works I guess I just gonna work with these but still gotta rip Ties That Bind since I was only able to find a The Suffering 1 Joshw xbox rip.

I decided to upload the PC version files in case anybody with the knowledge wanna try figuring out how to extract their data properly including the music audio. Drakan script doesn't seem to work properly since more than half of the files end up as unusable 1kb files.

Not sure if anybody cares but I was able to extract the PC OST of The Suffering. It isnt as good as the Xbox source so dont waste your time like me.

Furthermore, I dont know if anybody knew but the script to extract music from the Xbox version of The Suffering also works on the second game Ties That Bind. Xbox version of course. Was just a random thing I figured out. Weirdly enough didnt find a single OST rip of Ties That Bind. You btw need to extract a file named music.sdu which, at least on the Xbox, is in some weird shared folder. Furthermore it seems like that also in this case the Xbox has the highest music quality. Both PS2 and PC seem to use 22050khz files for everything. The Xbox uses 44100khz for dynamic action music and 22050khz for dark ambient music. Sometimes there also seem to be weird 32000khz or even 6000khz music files but some are also duplicates.

Just thought I leave this note to anyone wanting to rip the music from the games.

If someone is so kind, I was looking for 2 things, but I can't find a way, I found something on Alpha's side but it doesn't seem to work very well.

I was looking for 2 script for the following
- how to extract audio from a .bnk
- then once extracted, a script that is capable of being based on a "SoundBankInfo.XML" or "bnk.XML" to create the appropriate folders for AUDIO, Ambience, MUSIC etc... and rename the extracted .WEM files.
- sometimes there are some audios that are not in the XML, move them to an Unknow wwise folder.

Someone could help me? Thank you!
