- Post Title: Terminator Iphone Model format.

So I bought the terminator salvation app some time ago. it's not a bad game for what it is. then again it's not exactly a top ten game either.

 I opened her up and was able to get to the resources folder but that's where my ability ended and now I have little idea what engine this was made on or what format these models are in. I have included the archives of the Model.file object.file and one marked Terminator.file

Any help with this would be greatly appreciated as I am a big fan of the franchise. thank you in advance.
