- Post Title: EdenEternal how to decrypt NFS Folder

ello everyone, I have decrypted some games from X-Legend, but the game EdenEternal has a folder called NFS where the game files are located. Unfortunately, these cannot be decrypted using the .pkg script. Does anyone have an up-to-date script for this?

Attached is a part of the NFS folder from the game.

Thank you for your help.

There is no known public script that can decrypt the NFS folder in EdenEternal. This is because the NFS folder is encrypted using a custom encryption algorithm that is not publicly known.

However, there are a few things you can try:

You can try to contact the developers of EdenEternal and ask them for a decryption script.
You can try to reverse engineer the encryption algorithm and write your own decryption script.
You can try to find a third-party decryption tool that can decrypt the NFS folder.
