the Project Cars game ([http://www.wmdportal.com/projects/cars/](http://www.wmdportal.com/projects/cars/)) is developed by the same developers of NFS Shift and indeed its bff archives are similar except for a new encryption and something else smaller.

I have just updated the script to support the new key introducted in the new build 197:
[http://aluigi.org/papers/bms/nfsshift.bms](http://aluigi.org/papers/bms/nfsshift.bms)

I will update the script when new other versions (and keys) will be released.

Hi aluigi,

first, thank for your amazing quickbms 

I've tried to extract a .bff on the actual build (221) that don't work  

i don't know how i can find the new binary file for this newer build, like u said in your script "you must change the MEMORY_FILE3"

i downloaded "binary viewer" but don't know which file or which .exe must be open  ?


cordially

Hello, any idea for BFF files into "Test Drive Ferrari Racing Legends" ? (This game is developed by Slightly Mad Studios)

I try with QuickBms and the last script NFS: [http://aluigi.org/papers/bms/nfsshift.bms](http://aluigi.org/papers/bms/nfsshift.bms)


and it doesn't work   

Thanks in advance.

those are the names contained in the archive, personally I can't extract files with other names that I don't have or don't exist since it's not technically possible.

When i import the meb files with zmodeler it lists the material names that it cant find with the right name because the actual material files have the numbers only. 
So somewhere the right names have to be stored.

sure but not in the standard structure of the archive (the one used from NFS Shift), they may be contained in another file or even in the executable.
maybe even in the archive but probably in one of the files, not in its structure (I didn't see them)

Is there maybe a way to keep the materials on the model?
When i import it now it has one material assigned to the whole model. 

Or is this linked to the names issue?

Just keeping this topic at top. The nfsshift.bms script works to a certain extent. However we are having issues with any edits staying in place. IE You mod the DirPaks.toc file and remove the place where it points to the CAMPAIGN.bff. When starting the game, it opens and runs fine and changes are seen by editing the XML files inside the Campaign Missions folder. However it will not save your game progress. I am guessing do to GFWL. I can not find how to edit files and also save game progress. Any help would be appreciated.

script fixed, the error was in the key I used which was the wrong part of the original one (explanation: the key is just an array of mini-keys so if I take "almost all" its content then it will work with "almost all" the files eh eh eh)

[http://aluigi.altervista.org/papers/bms/nfsshift.bms](http://aluigi.altervista.org/papers/bms/nfsshift.bms)

Anyway PLEASE contact me via e-mail everytime you see similar problems so that I can be aware of them and fix them!

And keep me update also about the status of the nfsshift.bms script with all the games it currently supports, because the script MUST work with all the files of the latest versions of these games.

Hello Aluigi...is anybody else having issues UV's on the test drive Ferrari legends models? 
the wire frames are one big wire pile in 3dsmax and the mapping is bad on the bodies for all the cars...this is from the PC version of the game...is there anything that can be done about this issue?...all the other models for the 67 312 the textures all fit fine...its an issue with the bodies only...on every car i have unpacked so far    I am using the latest script from the above link .

I even managed to separate all the wires and make a wire template for the car body ....but part of the body is a TINY little UV that you can barely see...like a dot...and it does not show up on the body as a wire at all...like it has missing UV's

Any help would be very appreciated

This QuickBMS script is just for unpacking, it has nothing to do with importing models.

AFAIK TD Ferrari doesn't have liveries, so there's no reason to expect "neat" mapping on the body"

The Ferrari F430C uses liverys and has mapping to work with the skins provided in the game.
Many cars don't use liverys and that is why the mapping is not proper.

Also, some cars (such as F2008) apply badging and/or livery badging with a "Use Layer 2" shader property (based on old NFS Shift 1 shaders). The mapping is on a different layer and is mis-interpreted when pulled into a 3d app such as Zmodeler or 3dSimEd.  I've
ran into situations where I've had to remap all badging (which also required the creation of some new polys) on a model I wanted to pull from the game.

Almost every car has badges mapped on a different layer, which is absolutely normal. Example of 4th mapping channel for the F2008:
[](http://www.imagebam.com/image/a6c6c1231577343) 

ZModeler screws up, but using the right tools you get correct mapping 

P.S. Why the hell would you need to create polys in order to remap something??

file names and folders structure is screw up in TDFRL and C.A.R.S. after unpack bff, can it be fixed?
Does xbox version of TDF have the same problem? 

PS: I wonder if there are more car models than in PC version left on DVD. I found one file named Ferrari_456GT_EARLYZ_CPIT in PC version, but that's all.

@ Chipicao: what is that right tool then?

SMS has changed the structure of the BFF files in both C.A.R.S. and TDFRL.  The BFF files no longer contain standard file or folder names, as it did in the past with Shift 1 and S2U.  The Xbox version is the same.  So, you're left with the task of renaming all of the files, which is fairly straightforward (if you've worked on cars in either Shift 1 or S2U in the past).

Is there something I must do to make the script works for the most recent version of pCars (build 832)?

Hi there,

I'm also have trouble extracting the bff files in pcars. I'm trying to extract tracks and keep getting

"error: the specified offset can't be reached"
or
"error: invalid command "reverseshort" or arguments 1 at line 177"

Could you please have a look to see if its me that's messing things up or SMS/WMD have changed something? If they have changed something could you update the script as well?

Many thanks,
Cheers,


DrDoomsLab
