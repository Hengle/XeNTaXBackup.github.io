- Post Title: Star Wars The Old Republic to Jedi Academy

Hello there everyone, I would like to know if anyone knows how to export your SWTOR characters into Jedi Academy models.
Is it possible to make them directly to playable models or is there another good way to make the models?

I would appreciate every help.
