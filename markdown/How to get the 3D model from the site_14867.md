Ninja ripper is your friend to get models from Sketchfab and Firefox.

Hello

I get here the same thing as for SWTOR
Just a folder named 2016.08.19_18.22.00_firefox.exe with a firefox.exe.log.txt file into it.
Nothing else :/
I can't try any other option than Intruder Inject mode as i get an error message

So I tried to extract 3D models from the model viewer of torcommunity.com
([https://torcommunity.com/tools/model-viewer](https://torcommunity.com/tools/model-viewer))
I succeeded in extracting textures but the object is not good. It has been extracted correctly, if I open it into my 3D program i just get a line...
I used NinjaRipper1.5.1 into Intruder Inject mode
then Rip2Object to get the model into .obj and .mtl extension

how to get the object not completely messed up please ?
