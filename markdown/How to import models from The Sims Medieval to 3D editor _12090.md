1. Unpack s3pe-14-0113-1123.zip to navigate trough game archive (determine model resources by name and instance ID, first step - filter by MLOD tag)
2. Unpack in same folder s3piwrappers-r217.zip to preview models
3. Unpack in same folder meshHelper-s3asc_12-0601-2217.zip for export MLOD
4. Unpack to MilkShape folder MTS_WesHowe_1193936_msS3ObjPluginsV101.zip for import s3asc

Use MS to export model in another format ...

Question with searching textures and animation still open ...
