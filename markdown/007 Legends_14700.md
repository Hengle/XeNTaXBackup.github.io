007 Legends tools. To save time, I didn't make a full set of tools, so its done in steps:

1. Split big archives into individual "GEOM" files with vgmtoolbox.
vgmtoolbox "advanced cutter" can be found in "misc tools / extraction / generic"
Put 007_moeg.xml into plugins folder, load it and drag files onto it. Game files have no names, so proper extraction will not be possible anyway.

2. decrypt headers with 007_decrypt_geom.exe
Run it in the folder where you have .geom files. keytable.bin must be in the same dir.
Double run will encrypt them again.

3. Run 007_legends.bms script on decrypted .geom files and it will extract resources from it: textures, models, skeletons, other types.

4. 007_images.exe will convert all textures into DDS.
Run it in the folder where you have .texture files.

5. Drag .skel file onto 007_model.exe to convert all meshes in the directory and connect them with that skeleton. Low quality models will have many LODs. Recognized by having no finger bones. Usually not needed. Good quality models are usually in separate .geom file, with only one highest LOD.

007 Goldeneye PS3 models have almost the same format. So they also work with all weights and bones already.

Need to provide more details, what exactly are you doing? They need to be done one at a time, basically it's trial and error to see which file contains what character.

it's been a few weeks since i've done it, i made a custom .bat file that was applied to the tools, but it provided an error... i'll have to revisit this, or try with ps3 files.

by the way, the files for xbox 360 version of prototype seems to be unencrypted i think.

The xbox prototype actually contains Lois Chiles's likeness that was cut from the final version as Goodhead, I would love to get that head of hers at least and fit it onto the final body the very least. Tried using RenderDoc with Xenia Emu to rip it and it did not end well lol.

i'm doing some level porting at the moment, but i haven't really done anything with player characters.
another interesting thing is that there are files relating to mp space station map, perhaps it was planned but in the end they thought low gravity wasn't a fun setting or something?
most of the people moved onto different games a long time ago. there are some designers on artstation.

legends flew under my radar, but recently i got into old-bond hype, and this isn't really as bad as people said, however it's clearly a bad console port for pc.

I understand, level porting would be awesome because the ice palace and Piz Gloria are pretty cool levels and people would love to have them. Tell you what, if you're able to get the Goodhead model from the Xbox prototype by any means, I'll get you characters from the game and you can work on whatever you want, is that cool?

I don't really have interest in characters lol.
even then i could easily port most if not all from the campaign missions.

i've already ported icehotel and got sevveral others lined up. the game has like 8 maps only so it's not impossible, just a bit time consuming.

i've already finished like 85% of QOS.

Damn this is amazing! Never thought I'd see this happen someday but here we are. Do you plan on releasing these tools when you're done with it? Maybe adding prop support to it for weapons and such would be nice too.

Actually when you say you can port the characters from the campaigns, do you mean you can view the characters by their actual filenames? Because daemon's tool currently only outputs binary stuff so we're left to guess which file is what character through tedious trial and error. If there's a way to see the characters by their actual names that would change the whole world honestly...

I'm just using tools available and investing time to port it appropriately. It's a combination of different workflows. Haven't seen anyone doing this, lighting up the ice hotel is gonna be difficult.

Ah ok, I guess I hoped for too much lol. Well still that's pretty cool work but I wouldn't worry so much about the lighting until you've finished the tool. I'm sure other people will get right on that when they get access to this content

The prototype has like stuff before final compressing. Most file names are available, along with like memory addresses. I'm not good at this so i can't really work with this further, but just browse the prototype. No other version has so much access, no x360 pc ps3 wiiu

Oh didn't realise you were working the prototype, Xbox 360 I'm assuming? Does this tool let you rip anything from the game then? Like maps, chars and props and even sounds then? Would you be willing to share it privately maybe?

Oh dang, Quantum stuff too! Not bad at all, would be nice to have some of the maps like Casino too.

Well I forgot the name but the casino royale map from...the casino royale flashback lol. Btw, daemon's tool for ripping QoS characters doesn't output textures. Does this fix that?

Oh I see. Yeah alright, that makes sense. Well I don't know if you plan on making your tool public at some point but good luck in your future plans.

Sure, if you provide me with the tools you're already using I don't mind. I have like, no knowledge whatsoever of reversing file formats and coding anything so I'm no help there but I can use tools that already exist to output stuff at the moment.

I think we've clearly misunderstood each other, clearly my "offer" was preposterous but it does not fit the definition of selling anything, I wasn't asking you to pay me money or something so I could send you characters or whatever you wanted. Still if you have issues with getting any characters from Legends or Reloaded I don't mind digging around my own files and sending you what you want in return for nothing, and I'm more than willing to assist you with the maps for Legends

007 Legends tools. To save time, I didn't make a full set of tools, so its done in steps:

1. Split big archives into individual "GEOM" files with vgmtoolbox.
vgmtoolbox "advanced cutter" can be found in "misc tools / extraction / generic"
Put 007_moeg.xml into plugins folder, load it and drag files onto it. Game files have no names, so proper extraction will not be possible anyway.

2. decrypt headers with 007_decrypt_geom.exe
Run it in the folder where you have .geom files. keytable.bin must be in the same dir.
Double run will encrypt them again.

3. Run 007_legends.bms script on decrypted .geom files and it will extract resources from it: textures, models, skeletons, other types.

4. 007_images.exe will convert all textures into DDS.
Run it in the folder where you have .texture files.

5. Drag .skel file onto 007_model.exe to convert all meshes in the directory and connect them with that skeleton. Low quality models will have many LODs. Recognized by having no finger bones. Usually not needed. Good quality models are usually in separate .geom file, with only one highest LOD.

Sorry to dig up an old post but for some reason a couple of .ascii files being produced are corrupted for me and will not import into Blender or open in Noesis. Here's an example, "filelist_000000DC.geom" which is Gustav Graves, the .ascii file it produces is not readable. I've attached the .ascii file it outputs as well as the mesh files as well if anyone can help me with this.

If anyone can tell me what's wrong that would be much appreciated.
