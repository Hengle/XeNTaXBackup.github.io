- Post Title: Capcoms Shadow Of Rome Data files

So i have Shadow Of Rome ISO for Pcsx2 and I’m trying to open a file type within the iso that I believe contains data inside, the file types say theyre disc image files (.img), once opened I believe there’s character models I can swap around and play as, like a skin swap, a character called Antonius has the same skeleton model as main character. And walk/fight animations. Should be a simple skin swap hopefully, I believe once access I can just rename models and textures over and rebuild iso then mod is done. Just need help in anyone whos opened these type of files before from a ps2 ISO or someone who would know how to. There was an IMG tool for gta old games like 3, vice city and san andreas. something similar to that would be great.

Below is image of how the ISO looks extracted
