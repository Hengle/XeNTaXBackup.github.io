- Post Title: Space Hulk Ascension models

Hello everyone, I'm new to this entire forum but I've decided to throw my hat in and make an account. I've read a lot of helpful comments that have allowed me to get as far as I have with my personal project, but now I'd like some advice. I've extracted files from Space Hulk: Ascension's assets and I'm trying to convert them to .obj file format for use in Tabletop Simulator, but I have an issue.

I have no idea what a 43 file is (I mean it's a mesh but I cannot open it), whether a TEX file should open as a load of missing characters, and why I have a load of microsoft tables? But, hey, at least I can open the sound files! 

I've attached an image of my extracted files below, in case that helps. If anybody wants/needs the .assets file then I'll also put that up. I'm really looking forward to any help you can give me.

Cheers!
