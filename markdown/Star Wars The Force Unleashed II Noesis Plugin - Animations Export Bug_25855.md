- Post Title: Star Wars The Force Unleashed II Noesis Plugin - Animations Export Bug

Hi 
I recently wanted to export The Force Unleashed II assets to Blender or Unreal Engine. So I searched how to do this and I found what I needed here : [viewtopic.php?t=17614](https://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?t=17614) and [viewtopic.php?t=9295](https://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?t=9295). So I downloaded Noesis with the gto plugin... and everything worked. I was very happy until I try to export animations : when I export an animation, I need to choose a gto file for Noesis to open the animation (see : [https://i.imgur.com/GXIgL0Y.png](https://i.imgur.com/GXIgL0Y.png)) and when I select one that Noesis can open (see : [https://i.imgur.com/kekSN1g.png](https://i.imgur.com/kekSN1g.png)), I get the same thing as when I don't select one or I select one that doesn't work (see : [https://imgur.com/9NZjaym](https://imgur.com/9NZjaym)). I tried exporting the animation and seeing how it look like in blender and it is even weirder (see : [https://imgur.com/JLPv13T](https://imgur.com/JLPv13T)). I tried with with practically all player gto file and nothing worked. Please help. Am I doing something wrong or is it just the plugin that doesn't work ?

And when I export gto file into an fbx for example, the bones have weird names (see to the left of the image : [https://imgur.com/VgLCjsI](https://imgur.com/VgLCjsI)). Is it the normal bones names or is it Noesis that can't export the bones names ? It would be logical that it's Noesis that can't export the bone's names and therefore the animations doesn't "recognize" the bone's names which will explain why I get the same result as when I don't select a file for the animation or when I select one that doesn't work.

Thanks in advance for your replies.

Hello Adriwin, 

Thank you for taking the time to post here about your issue with exporting animations from the Force Unleashed II Noesis plugin. It sounds like you have done a lot of troubleshooting already and I will certainly do my best to help. 

First, I would suggest double-checking that you have the most up-to-date version of the plugin. If that does not help, I would suggest testing the same workflow using a different game or asset. If that works, then the issue is likely specific to Force Unleashed II. If it does not work, then there may be an issue with the Noesis plugin itself. 

Regarding the bones, it is possible that Noesis is not exporting the names correctly. In that case, you may need to rename the bones manually to ensure the correct connections when importing into Blender or Unreal Engine.

I hope this helps,
