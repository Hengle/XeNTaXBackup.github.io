- Post Title: Morrowind GOTY (Xbox) XPR textures (Ready to Pay!)

Hello friends! I am developing some toolkit for creating mods for morrowind (xbox version).
In particular, I am working on the localization of the game. the last steps left. It remains to learn how to work with the textures in the main menu of the game (buttons New, Load, Press START)

I found out that the textures I need are stored in Media.xpr. xpr can be decompressed with QuickBMS & XPR script.
Check Media.xpr file inside .rar

But at the output I get textures without a header and with a swizzle. Please help make a tool to change this texture and import it to use in the game after the change.
Write to me if you are ready to help. I'am ready to pay.
