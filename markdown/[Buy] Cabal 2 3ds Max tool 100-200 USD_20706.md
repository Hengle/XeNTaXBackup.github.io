Isn't it just a CryTek model format? I know, there was tools-scripts for the game long time ago. I remember, that I imported models from this game long time ago. Format shouldn't change much! Maybe newer tools for CryEngine will work. Try something for star citizen, ryse SoR or homefront (or for mmo game evolve). Or you was talking about an export tool?
