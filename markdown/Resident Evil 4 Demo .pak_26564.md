You can use a .list file from previous remakes, and rename it as the unpacker wants edit the bat file and delete "skip unknow" (like I did) I succefully extracted all.. the problem is the files have no name and a new extension wich is not supported yet.. I tried rename the extension number but nothing works with re remake noesis plugins.

Just wait for the full release of the game, I'm sure there will be a chance to get the full names and extract files.

Is the .list for pc .pak files only or is it compatible for the ps4 ones as well? 
I´m trying to extract them but nothing happens. There are 2 .pak files: re_chunk_000.pak and re_chunk_001.pak. Same issue with both. Thanks

PS4 Version requires different .list file, it contents are not the same size as pc version.

Thanks again for providing this .list file but this list file is not complete and it's not extracting the intro movie and intro audio file too, also not working 100% with DLCs

Any help will be appreciated
