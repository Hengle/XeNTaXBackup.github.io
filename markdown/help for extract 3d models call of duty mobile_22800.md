You gotta get the models from the phone version, ripping doesn't work with emulators on this game

Edit: Use this thread:
[https://www.vg-resource.com/thread-31141.html](https://www.vg-resource.com/thread-31141.html)

You need Unity Asset Studio and the game installed to your phone, where you will require to unpack the .obb file. Then open the content of the unpacked file with Asset Studio.

However, it's not even opening nearly all the models. I can't find a bunch of character models with it.

Edit 2: Hold on, I forgot you need to install even more assets in the main menu of the game. Have to see if it's getting the missing content.

Edit 3: Rest of the models are located in data/files folders

Can I just download an APK of CoDM and do this too? You mentioned it downloads assets on the main menu of the game, I don't have an android device so I don't know how I'd get around this.

APKs don't contain models, you gotta download the game to a phone to get the models

Just got a question, somebody know the texture 2d format? Im trying different one but still no success yet. 

Thanks in advance, for the ones wondering how to extract models, first download asset studio(latest version), after that locate the file for example, some games have their models in obb if you don't find anything the next location is in data/files, most of the time depending on your computer you can upload in one shot all the game with asset studio, but otherwise upload in parts like this game.

I was also unable to extract at textures using AssetStudio v0.15.x, it is unable to view textures or extract.

If you are using Bluestack or some other software i will recommend you to visit different apk websites like [apkquirk](https://www.apkquirk.com)  apkpure etc. in these website you will get all the games and apps according to your choice.

This is worthless because the game downloads assets only after you launch the game, and as far as I'm concerned it's difficult or impossible to find the stuff you're looking for it downloaded on an emulator.

Call of Duty Mobile does not work with traditional Unity unpackers due to it's modified data structures, and the dev (Perfare) has specifically stated that AssetStudio will not support it. 

Your best bet at getting textures is using the Unity DevX Unpacker tools, which you can use for free (at a 2 minute cooldown for textures), or buy for 500 dollars. Your choice on that one.

Damn this is pretty crappy, 2 minutes per every texture cooldown really sucks, but I'll take it over shelling out 500 I guess...

Hello, Are you tried to install the bluestacks software on your desktop? When I was working on the design of my site [https://www.iwantcheats.net/call-of-dut ... ts-aimbot/](https://www.iwantcheats.net/call-of-duty-vanguard-hacks-cheats-aimbot/), I faced the same kind of trouble with extracting files directly from the android device. I needed to extract some in-game models to make a proper design on my site. Don't use the Nox emulator for extracting. It works badly. It will be much easier to extract models from your PC.

Can you by any chance make a tutorial on it. Because after turning the .obb file to a .zip and unzipping it I found a .pak file but every time I try to open it. It gives an error.
