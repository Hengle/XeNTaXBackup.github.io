- Post Title: Rally Championship XTreme Compression

Been wondering about this for a while, apparently custom compression method. I've attached an uncompressed and compressed file that should be the same. (the uncompressed was found laying in the game files, and the compressed was extracted from an archive)

I tried running a comtypescan but it didn't find a suitable compression. Looks like digging into the game's executables will be necessary. You can try making a request on ZenHAX.

format .rcx(the abbreviated name of the game?) only for this game? not unpacker archive of textures and  models?
