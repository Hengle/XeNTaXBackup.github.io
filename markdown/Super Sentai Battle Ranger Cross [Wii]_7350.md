So I've used the following:

[BRRES Model Viewer\Converter (version 1.0-1.2)](http://www.mediafire.com/file/zdr4chm4m3pzyj7/brresviewer.rar)
[ActorX Importer for 3ds Max](http://www.gildor.org/projects/unactorx)

And the resulting imported model looks great in 3ds Max:

But, as you can see the bones are all outta whack. Is there something I can do about that (be it automatically or manually)?

100nadzmi, it works on 3ds max 2010 32 bit.

All you have to do is put it in your "Scripts" folder (you don't even need to do that if you don't want to, but it makes it easier), which should be located at C:\Program Files\Autodesk\3ds Max 2010\Scripts

Then you just go to "MAXScript" and select "Run Script..." and select "ActorXImporter.ms".
