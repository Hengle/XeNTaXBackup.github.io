Is there is any way that we can extract HAWX and HAWX2 3d models???
I saw some 3d models from hawx1 at ubi forums but i don't know how to extract them.

yes its possible to extract from HAWX, there should be a couple of threads dotted about here regarding the info, its where i found it 

or if you want to save some time . I already ripped and uploaded all the hawx 1 planes. 
you can grab them here.. [Depositfiles](http://depositfiles.com/en/files/8euwb5jmo) or here [Hotfile](http://hotfile.com/dl/48354818/7cbd935/Hawx.rar.html)  94.1 MB

Hope that helps.

P.S. They are in OBJ format so almost any 3D app will load the models just fine.
