- Post Title: MexScript Big Endian

Hello i´m pretty new to MultiEx Commander really great tooly by the way   .
Anyway i try unpack a archive file that uses for some offsets big endian order.So is there any way to use big endian in a MultiEx script ?
Another question i have is sometimes you have 2 files one with the data and one with the filenames, offsets and so on, is it possible to  use 2 files ?

Thanks in advance

Thanks for the answer . However im still not sure how to change the Endian Order usually i would use some bitshifting but that doesn´t seems to be supported by mexscript. I saw that for bms files you can use something like "endian big" but if i try my script i get a message like Fileslist empty (yes i used the log statement  ).
