- Post Title: Any help for extracting this "new type" bnk files?

I've attached two random files that's are ".bnk". I'm unable to extract them, i've tryed lot of tools and all 'quickbms bnk scripts' that are on luigiauriemma website but without success.

Any help will be appreciated, thanks a lot!!  

EDIT. Thanks to the user "DKDave", I was able to open the files with Foobar and script "vgmstream". But there isn't a way to extract original files directly?
