- Post Title: [UNITY] DK mobile, unencrypted, "normal header" , not work with AssetStudio

When I try to load files of this game in AssetStudio " No files loaded". It doesn't seem encrypted, is there something missing in the header so that AssetStudio doesn't recognize it or it's just unsupported ? i've tried other 5.0 unity files from different games and they work well... Any idea? 

Thanks in advance

i tried with utiny ripper which doesn't manage to get the "version" of unity used, maybe assetstudio has the same problem since it show's 5.x.x.0.0.0.
The game can be vaguely opened with DevxStudio but most textures are not readable and i dunno why asset meshes aren't viewable in unity so importing prefab is not usefull at all.
Only thing i can say it's that the game assets are basicaly a copy/paste from the old DK mmo (lots of animations too) maybe a few things are new but~~~
