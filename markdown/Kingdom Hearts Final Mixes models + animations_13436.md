Yeah, given the number of horrible furries we have around here, I imagine plenty of them have had success in getting off to all versions.

Funny thing I had to get full 2.5 version only to get Stitch model  I know there are full tools for 2.5 version like khkh_xldmii and noesis have support too (.mdlx and .map), I never searched for 1.5 tho.

Recent mods, mainly by CrazyCatz00, ported all the new dub audio and animations from KH2.5 to KH2FM via patches. The rest of the animations are pretty much the same as KH2FM, whose animations can be extracted imported into Noesis via tools and plugin dlls made by revelation and kkdf2. The KH1.5 and 2.5 models are also mostly the same, except the character, enemy, and weapon models were given higher-res retextures, except in BBSHD's case, in which several of these were remodeled. There are already model importers/exporters for the original KH1FM, KH2FM, and BBSFM. However, no one has ever made a BBSFM animation reader, and the only tool that could read KH1 MSET animations was version 0.3 of yaz0r's ModelViewerWXD3D9, but even that couldn't convert them into other formats. There is a plugin for Noesis somewhere on XeNTaX that allows it to read KH1.5 models, but they have to be extracted from the disc files first.
