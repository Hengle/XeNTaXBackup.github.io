- Post Title: Darkness Within (bin)

I want to edit this game, but all files is in the .bin files, and I can't find editor or unpacker.
The files is uncompressed inside the bin. Most of all pictures (jpg,dds,tga).

If you just want those images, try a generic file ripper.

I need all data from the bin, not just the image. And with file ripper some picture is not readable, or not complete.
