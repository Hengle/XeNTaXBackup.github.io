- Post Title: Sims 4 Demo Create a Sim .package Files

Sims 4 Demo released. It seems like ordinary Sims 3 files but not a single Sims 3 mod tool could open these new .package files. Here is an example. I think it contains strings for Portuguese language.

There's a tool already that has been tweaked from S3PE.

Wow, they're fast. It doesn't work properly though. Only lists the contains of package file, nothing more. I'm sure it will get better soon since now somebody is working on it. Thanks for sharing:)

The tool can actually extract files from the .package archive.

But it can't batch process just yet.

You have to right click and manually select each file you wish to extract.
