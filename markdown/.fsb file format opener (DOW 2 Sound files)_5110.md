- Post Title: .fsb file format opener? (DOW 2 Sound files)

Hey I am new here, and new to ripping and porting sounds. But I am trying to get the Dawn Of War 2 Sound files ripped so I can mess with them. The only problem is, I don't know where to begin. The .sga files hold archives I believe, but in those archives the sound files might use a different extension that none of my sound players could possibly play.

EDIT: I found out how to open .sga archives, but the sound files for the game are in .fsb format... Have any idea how I could convert them to a .mp3/.wav file?


Any help that is offered would be deeply appreciated.

try fsbext here: [http://aluigi.altervista.org/papers/fsbext.zip](http://aluigi.altervista.org/papers/fsbext.zip)

if encrypted, use guessfsb: [http://hcs64.com/files/guessfsb03.zip](http://hcs64.com/files/guessfsb03.zip)

they are command line tools, you must run them with cmd.exe

Main problem with Dawn of War 2 files - multi channel and ima_adpcm files in fsb. fsbext extract, but not decode files.

More attentive view revealed next:

ToWAV can decode 7 of 26 .fsb music files:
credits_music.fsb (standart MP3)
el_victory_01.fsb (IMA ADPCM-coded WAV)
endthemelayer2.fsb (standart MP3)
or_victory_01a.fsb (IMA ADPCM-coded WAV)
sm_victory.fsb (standart MP3)
stinger_defeat_01a_05sec.fsb (standart MP3)
ty_victory_01a.fsb (IMA ADPCM-coded WAV)

Other 19 files is multichannel WAVs and dont decodable in any programs(ToWav, fsbext), except fsb_mpeg.

fsbext just unpack raw data, which cant be played with and without -a key in any programs right(winamp with vgmstream, Sony Sound Forge 10).
