- Post Title: Twisted Metal 2: Audio from str files

Guys, I'm at my wit's end here and desperately hoping you can help.

I'm trying to get the audio from the PS1 game Twisted Metal 2. On the disc are some str movies. I have thrown every single program I can find on Google and Zophar's Domain at those damn things to try and get the audio from them, but nothing works.

I'm hoping and praying someone can extract the audio from them for me. I would be eternally grateful.

I was able to get this extracted with some help over at HCS forums [HERE](http://hcs64.com/mboard/forumlong.php?showthread=40297).

Now the challenge is trying to get the sound effects from the vab file from the PC version of Twisted Metal 1. Only problem is, PSound and Video Game Sound Converter won't touch it.

Can anyone assist?
