I quote from myself:

> In the PC version, the file containing the texts of the game is in the oasisstrings.xml file, in the common.dat/.fat archive, however the game doesn't read from there, but a compressed oasisstrings_compressed.bin file is there too with the texts of the game.

> So my guess is, we have to compress the .xml file to .bin, to make the game use it.

"oasisstrings.xml" for now we can't compress this file to bin file?
