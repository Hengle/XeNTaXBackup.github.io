Does anyone know of an updated script or tool for the Unity version v4.6.8p4? I used the latest I could find but its a couple versions before this one, but the model itself gets corrupted when trying to add modifiers in 3ds max.

I've used all the unity tools out there and same thing with each and every one. Not sure why CSR 2 has messed up mesh.
