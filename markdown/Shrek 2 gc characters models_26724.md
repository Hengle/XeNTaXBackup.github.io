- Post Title: Shrek 2 gc characters models

I've been trying for years to do things with the character models from the GameCube Shrek video game, but the file extensions are unknown to me and I don't know how they could be handled.

I don't think there are Quickbms Scripts to open the files. They are .def, .gcs or .ngc files. Also, each character has its animations in .anb and .gcs files

game files: [https://www.mediafire.com/file/fqleuukd ... 1.rar/file](https://www.mediafire.com/file/fqleuukdsbv4qvn/root1.rar/file)

example .gcs file: [https://drive.google.com/file/d/13CpJZB ... sp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/13CpJZBtUfmupxH6RqHQXDlCUqbJFAWBs/view?usp=sharing)
example .ngc file: [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gDPVwA ... sp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gDPVwAp-wRfABf8VaU-DV8LDw2hWLyaY/view?usp=sharing)
example .def file: [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nuiJoz ... sp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nuiJozokDeGDtfp3_4R2DUXJOfRSRTxK/view?usp=sharing)

example animations files: [https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/ ... sp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/13NDGn3k-zDTlYyPi2MPl29Y7_i0_RFkp?usp=sharing)

All playable characters have these files. For the npcs, only their animations seem to be in the character folder, so I don't know what directory their models might be located in. Any information is of great help to me. I am very much a beginner in all this and have always wanted to understand more to do this kind of thing.

I've been trying for years to do things with the character models from the GameCube Shrek video game,I have no idea what you tried, but getting a point cloud is not too hard. Face indices are another story (again...  ) But a point cloud skinner shows how it's expected to look:

Maybe it is a very silly question and it is something that everyone knows how to do, but I have never learned. How can I get those point clouds you are talking about?

If you don't have them you could start reading the tutorials I linked in my sig.
