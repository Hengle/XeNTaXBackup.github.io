- Post Title: zlib scan and extract C#

i wondering if someone could help me with a function to do what offzip does?
eg: -a -z -1 -15
some of the fast files (PS3), do not have the standard zlib headers.
the header is the size of the file - 2
so i really dont know how to scan for the zlib
offzip regardless of the zlib header extracts the file.
dont get me wrong offzip is a great tool, i just need the ability to specify the name of the output file.

or maybe just some pointers of how i can implement it.
