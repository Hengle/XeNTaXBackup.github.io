Hi, I think this is my first post here lol btw I am trying to get CSR 2's car models but after extracting the 2 obb files and the apk all I can get are buildings, roads, and stuff, no cars. I am using Chipi's Unity Importers for 3ds max.. I just want to get the James Hunt P1 GTR lol.. Thanks!

You need ios version, there does not need app cash there all inclusive.

You need to unpack the files you want from 'High' folders using QuickBMS using Unity Web Build Script continue at the end of the file append * .byundle and open with UnityStudio
