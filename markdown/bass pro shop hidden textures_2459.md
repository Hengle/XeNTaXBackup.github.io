Anyone know what file could possibly hold the textures for animals and models in pro bass shops trophy hunter 2007? File types include the following: r.XML.meq and .kmf. Curious if mutliex will be supporting this game later on also. Thanks for any help with this possible in advance.

Not sure what you expect to do but the datafile is often determined by it's size. A big file suggests it holds somthing. Other times a name suggests it. Like Sound/SFX/SFX/Mus/etc.. would suggest a sound datafile. Main suggests the main data. Etc.

Well posting a datafile allows people somthing to work on because not many may own the game you speak of here.
