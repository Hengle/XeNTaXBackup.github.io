Hmm, I'm just wondering if any one of you guys are interested in opening these files up. Magic tag on header is "«IM2M3G»", but I'm not sure about the rest, other than a few strings that may indicate some dummy or car part.

If anyone wants a sample file or two, feel free to PM me.

Yeah I'm actually looking for someone who can import M3Gs to Max. They seem kinda' high-poly from what I can observe.

I really hope someone can finally do that, since M3G format is basicly universal
