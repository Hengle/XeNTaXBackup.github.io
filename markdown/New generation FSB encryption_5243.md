- Post Title: New generation FSB encryption

any progress on this? i suspect the one have to check original (undecrypted) xen's, cause it might be already decrypted wrong.
hsc'c tool guessfsb.exe can't find a key in it, so to me the problem is in XEN encryption itself, not FSB.
here is a 6-ch example from game: [http://dl.dropbox.com/u/5646108/cryin_2.fsb.xen](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/5646108/cryin_2.fsb.xen)
