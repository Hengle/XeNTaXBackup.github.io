This error is most likely WEIRD to say the least. It looks like it is trying to connect to the xentax website for support, but fails to do so and then exits. This should not happen! Even if it did try to connect, if it fails it should resume normal operation. 

Are you connected to the internet when you try to start it?

What type of internet connection do you have?
