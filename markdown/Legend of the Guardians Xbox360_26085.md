I extracted some files from this game they firstly paked in rkv file format in this game but some of them after extaction is in MDG, MDLB, TEX and BIN formats i tried Noesis and JSRF mod Tool to just see 3d models, but Noesis just didnt read these formats and JSRF only see the BIN files but cant exrtact them or export in different readable formats. Here's the link to extracted files

Thanks a lot, Leshiy, I was going to extract the Legend of the Guardians 3d models, but I will try the shared file. You saved my time.
