- Post Title: Modern Combat Versus - Character Assets

Hey, everyone. First time posting here, I hope this is ok.

I'm looking to extract models and their respective rigging/textures from the game Modern Combat Versus. You can find it on Steam here: [https://store.steampowered.com/app/7237 ... at_Versus/](https://store.steampowered.com/app/723780/Modern_Combat_Versus/)

When I searched around before, I was able to find this thread: [https://zenhax.com/viewtopic.php?t=7199](https://zenhax.com/viewtopic.php?t=7199) which had a script to deal with ".f" files.

So I downloaded the voxarch.bms, but all I can really get out of it is .wav audio files, which are voiceovers/announcer clips, while I'm looking for models. I've attached some .f files, the larger ones, to see if there's any way to get the models I'm looking for. Help would be appreciated. I've also attached a screencap of the quickbms window error it gives me (seems to be looking for "bres", which I know nothing of.)

Thank you!

that script you are using is for sound assets only. there is a second script in that thread you linked. use it to get texture assets and some other .dat files from the game. unfortunately there are no scripts to extract the rigged models from the game yet.

I see, that's unfortunate. Thanks for the info, hopefully scripts can be developed in the near future!
