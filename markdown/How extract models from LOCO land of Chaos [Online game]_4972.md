I would like to help you, but could you test the FoxLady mesh and tell me if it works and either way upload that too. This will be very helpful. Also the major character file you uploaded is not compressed which is good because compressed Unreal models awkward to work with.

Since we already had 2 topics in two different forums, why don't you post your problem in the Umodel Forums? You know, the place where the 'AUTHOR' of the program might be able to do something about it...

Hi AceAngel, thanks foer the hint, but in the gildor's forum he says only:
"It looks like LOCO developers has changed package tag (1st 4 bytes). Can't say anything particular about other data structures.
You can use umodel with older LOCO version."

The problem is that the first beta release of Loco online seems disappeared from the web long time ago.

To get the models to load in umodel open the mesh using a hex editor and change the first 4 bytes to "C1 83 2A 9E"
Send me a pm if you do not know what a hex editor is.
