Not many people would help, since you attached xored sample. At least, please attach here (copy paste), bms script for de-xoring. Anyway, here's main part of your model.

I made a basic maxscript to import your samples, I think you're interested only in weapons? Since you're uploading only them, not characters. And for future, please upload more model samples, on any filehosting you desire (5-10 will be filne, but in generally more you upload better)

Here's maxscript for your files. Don't expect much it's a raw, alpha script but should work for weapons. Don't try other models like characters, they will not work I'm sure of it (if you need them to work, upload them too).

UV's yes working, didn't check them 100% because there was no textures, but it's easy to fix if they will not fit. But they looks okay. You will need 3ds max 2009 and higher btw
