Just cause an older version used csv doesn't mean the new version will.

Well the good news is you can find almost all of the strings in the .dat file as well, so that would suggest it is the same data just stored in a different way now.

Guess you'll have to ask the server guys to go grab a copy of the new parsers, or write your own dat --> csv if you must have it in csv.

Yep it's just new file format. EVP file format changed too. For example data.evp can not be extracted with using EvpTool.
