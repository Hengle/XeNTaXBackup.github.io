- Post Title: What are .mtl/.cgf/.chr files?

Could somebody explain what are .mtl files?
From what i figure is they are some kind of image files - however i have absolutely no idea how to open one of those buggers!

Also im trying to figure out the meaning of .CGF - NOT CFG!! - files - i cannot find anything about them!

And last but not least - how would i go about opening .chr files?

If you could give me a hit that would be ever so greatly appriciated

only the extensions usually are not enough because games use a lot of fantasy extensions and even those used for other purposes.
maybe specify also the game.

For CGF and CHR I'll refer you to this post -->> [here](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=2912)

MTL I can only assume a material file of some sort detailing the textures and settings used for those textures.

more specifically those files appear when i was going through textures for Crysis 2...

for example for weapon Scar_V2:
scar_fp.cdf
scar_fp_screens.cgf
scar_fp_screens.chr
scar_fp_screens.chrparams   - this one is WTF i have never seen an extension so long >.>
scar_v2_camo.mtl

The textures i CAN open are fortunately in .dds meaning i can actually save them back into the game - the only thing im concerned about is weather i need to edit for example some of the .mtl files as they appear alot throughout the file and I wouldn't want any of them compromising my texture :s
