- Post Title: custom NBA Street Vol. 2 music always corrupt.

I tried adding custom music to NBA Street Vol 2. for the XBox.
The music is .asf format, just like most EA games.
I used DittyImporter to convert an .mp3 to .asf format, but when loaded up in-game it never works, I always hear high-pitched, corrupt sounding tones.

Does anybody know what I'm doing wrong?
(also, any help on modding NBA Street Vol. 2 is greatly helped)
