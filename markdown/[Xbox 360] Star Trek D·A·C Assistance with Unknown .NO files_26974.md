Hi.

Star Trek D路A路C has largely undocumented asset files associated with the game. The game was discontinued and or removed from storefront some time ago and there doesn't seem to be much information about the assets and other interesting things about the game.

The only thing I could find about decompiling the game is this steam discussion on a thread about the game and nothing more.

If someone wouldn't mind helping with trying to extract the sample files provided, that would be great.

Thanks.

There's also the ObjectFiles folder which features the entirety of the folder.
