Nice one but I have a problem, I cant load archives. Choosing the "Load Archive" option results in... nothing  Besides that I noticed that the filters-option (*.*) is enabled but filters are deactivated. Activating and deactivating filters again solves this problem.

Keep it up.

I like that Reimport button. I think it will make working with BMS scripts much easier for many people.

since critics are better than good things that's my list of negative critics :)

BSM? is it a typo or what does it mean? I guess it's a typo by reading the About
if you plan to continue the development I highly suggest you to make a homepage where hosting it, maybe ask to mr.mouse for the space
personally I would prefer to keep quickbms.exe out for various reasons included the fact that I update it very frequently so it will avoid lazy people saying "it doesn't work" because they are using an old version (you can't imagine how much times this happens due to the various jurassik mirrors!)
you can add drag'n'drop
you should avoid to use Reimport/Extract if no script, archive and folder are specified
the operations to set script, archive and folder should be available also as buttons
here when I load a script it takes lot of time (almost 30 seconds for zip.bms) and cpu
Load Archive doesn't work at all
open source! :)
anyway I plan to add an internal GUI in quickbms in one of the next versions of QuickBMS, don't know when and how but in any case it will not conflict this one so it's all ok.

Sure. Do you need some space? Like on qbmsgui.xentax.com or something? May also want a more kinky name for it.

I hope you don't remove the line command option, cause I'm a game translator and I use quickBMS.exe inside my installers to process the game data files. If you kill the line command option i'm fu**ed.

2 more things
1 - There's no 'Undo' command
2 - If there are spaces in the path to the Output folder, it doesn't extract anything.

Not work on every script or game archive. If archive is divided on chunks then most likely it is not possible to use reimport function.

I understand, well I would like your help if possible.
I extract the file contents Data00.packed with the script posted on the forum, but I'm not sticking to import the content back.
Would have to create another script to import the content back?

I'm always using the "cmd way" to use some tools (not only for game resource archives/file unpacking), and it's because this is the more easy way for me, but sometimes this tool can come in handy. 

Well made tool, michalss!

@michalss
Please don't include quickbms with your gui.

People need EVER the latest version of my program so it's better if you launch their browser on [http://quickbms.aluigi.org](http://quickbms.aluigi.org) if quickbms.exe is not available in the tools folder.

I plan also to add a command-line option (like -u) for performing the update of quickbms so that would be easier to check if there are new versions.

I think is necessary add a option to select multiple files, because in game Seven Souls, have 17k textures, just imagine select one by one to unpack them, is a pain in the ass.

really no need to use the gui tool in this thread, the Quickbms version is also outdated, grab the latest from here
[http://aluigi.altervista.org/quickbms.htm](http://aluigi.altervista.org/quickbms.htm)

Quickbms is easy enough to use by itself, just follow the on-screen prompts and 
you can select as many files as you want to run a script on

Hi there,

haven't been here for such a long time (YEARS...)
I'm really interested in extracting the game's music files, since no official soundtrack exists.
I can provide samples of the .pack files inside the common\Wolfenstein.II.The.New.Colossus\base\sound\soundbanks\pc folder.
I barely remember a program in here that let you gather the necessary file information from the beginning, middle and end of the file, so that you don't have to upload hundreds of megabytes. What was the program's name? I'll upload file samples if you tell me the name of it again.

I wanted to write a little script today so I came back here to get this tool.
There was a little syntax highlighting problem with it but not only the author didn't leave any source code but also slapped an obfuscator on it.

So I ran it through de4dot, modified a bit with dnspy and also added missing keywords to the ini file (and removed the many duplicates).
Also fixed the highlighting of multiline comments

This is my application, i left it coz i dont have time to manage it anymore. If you would just ask me i would give you a source code, this is wrong way to to do such a modification. There was never my attention to do any obfuscation on it as to help ppl. Next time ask before you gonna mod someone else application.

Nah, I didn't do anything wrong at all. It's publicly available, free and looked abandoned.
Plus I didn't put my  name anywhere to claim that I made it. I even include your original exe in the archive.
It's still your software, I just edited it a little to fix small bugs. Also your last version was from 2012, I didn't even bother asking because I didn't think you still remembered this, let alone still had the source code.

Also I suppose you applied the Crypto obfuscator because you wanted to do it. I don't think it's something automatic or accidental....
(unless your IDE was somehow set to use it on all projects)

Yeah releasing the source on github or something would be cool too. I'm sure other people can improve it even more.

Thanks  michalss for the GUI.
