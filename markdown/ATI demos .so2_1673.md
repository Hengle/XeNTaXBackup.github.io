Here's an .so2 extractor:

[http://www.geocities.ws/dawn3dmodel/ruby/index.html](http://www.geocities.ws/dawn3dmodel/ruby/index.html)

It doesn't seem to work on Win7 though, I had to switch to XP to get the model.
I think the textures with the model are in the .sa2 files, though the format is unknown.
Reading up on ATi tech., I'm thinking these are actually socalled "PRT textures"

[Edit]
Anyway, the textures can be extracted using 3DripperDX v1.8.1
