Well I only know the extractor: [http://psx-scene.com/forums/content/pkg ... ctor-2117/](http://psx-scene.com/forums/content/pkgview-v1-3-ps3-psx-psp-pkg-viewer-extractor-2117/)
Why do you want to learn about the format? Modding?

The PKG files alientech is talking about are within the PS3 PKG format. The only thing it shares is the same extension.

If you guys want to unpack EDAT files from this game, you guys need to grab RAP file that contains RIF keys,

and EDAT can be easily decrypted with KLIC KEY and RAP file on these days,

try to find this file on the internet, "EP0002-NPEB02097_00-DSTPUBLICBETAP30.rap" this will do the trick to decrypt NPDRM EDAT files 

Of course you guys need EDAT Decrypter as well, Jikkyu's EDAT Rebuilder 1.45 c works really well

The PS3 files are "off limits" for me. It appears that they are encrypted (most likely) or are using an unknown compression. The Xbox 360 beta files can't be obtained due to the file system they use, it has not been figured how to obtain the direct files from GoD based games.

I'm guessing we'd have to hope that the PC/Xbox final releases do not use this (they most likely will)...

I have the files for the Xbox 360 beta. Convert the GOD file to ISO, then extract the iso to get the contents.

Now that the game is out, I'm curious if anyone is working on the .pkg format for either Xbox 360 or PS3?

I bought the game and am enjoying it so far, it has some really fantastic art, textures, music and UI that it would be great to be able to extract.
