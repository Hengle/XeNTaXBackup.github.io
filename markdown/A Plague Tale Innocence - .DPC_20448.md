Hello

I'm trying to extract the fonts from the .DPC archive, but it looks like it need a special tool for extracting it,
so could someone please provide such a tool?

*here are the font files:

Does .dpc also apply to the sound files?

I believe aluigi has a bms script that extracts .dpc files. [https://aluigi.altervista.org/quickbms.htm](https://aluigi.altervista.org/quickbms.htm)

I tried both scripts available at that website, both doesn't work with this game.

(both scripts are meant for "Ratatouille" video game, released back in 2007, developed by the same studio, and uses the same archive format .DPC, which kinda means, these scripts might need just a little edit to work with A Plague Tale Innocence, however I don't really know how\what to change.)

Maybe this post is repetitive, but there have been several topics for this game, none of which have been successful. I hope this is the last topic and that all my friends, including myself, will solve this problem. Please, someone help me make a tool that can add game fonts to the dpc file.  Extract it and pack it. One of my friends made a tool. Unfortunately, after packing, it gives an error and the game cannot be used
