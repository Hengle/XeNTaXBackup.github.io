Need help with extracting audio from this. 
I got an .ACB and .AWB from the .CPK file, and managed to extract multiple .HCA files from those using VGMtoolbox.

If I listen to the .hca, it comes out garbled.

Here are two examples:

Thanks.

How were you able to extract the two files?

I also tried to extract audio, but from another game(JoJo's Bizarre Adventure All-Star Battle). Exactly the same problem, don't know what to do.

You need the correct decryption key for the decoder to work.
