- Post Title: Man of Medan localization

Hi,
i would like You to ask for little help. Could tell me how to extract "pak" file from Man of Medan? I want to make by myself a polish cinematic version of game (because no PL version available), but don't know how to "unzip" file. Already try UnrealPak.exe , but after using command prompt it's throw me Critical Error.

I will be very appreciated for some advice or maybe instruction how to get in this PAK files. I really want to translate a game in my native language.
