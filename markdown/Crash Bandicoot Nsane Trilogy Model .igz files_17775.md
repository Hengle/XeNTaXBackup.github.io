- Post Title: Crash Bandicoot Nsane Trilogy Model .igz files

So I have managed to extract data from the crash bandicoot nsane trilogy .pkg ps4. I am trying to get the 3d models, textures, and other music files from the game. The files from the extraction are mostly .pak files and I used the quickbms script called marvel_ultimate_alliance_2.bms from here: [http://zenhax.com/viewtopic.php?p=12694#p12694](http://zenhax.com/viewtopic.php?p=12694#p12694). 

Most files from the .pak extracted fine but now there is this .igz format. I looked into some old threads of someone that managed to make a noesis plugin to read the .igz but it doesn't read the format still. The MUA_PC.zip has the noesis plugins at the bottom of this thread: Ihttp://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?p=121800#p121800. I also tried to use the use the marvel_ultimate_alliance_2.bms script to extract from the .igz but it also didn't work. If there is anyone who could help me with this I would appreciate it. 

Here are some sample files:

never count on scripts for one game to work with a different one. those scripts were designed
for a different game and platform with almost no chance of working with your samples.

Ok just thought there would be a chance to work since the bms script could unpack the .pak files. 

Here is some sample .pak files:

I've actually been meaning to get at the models from this game for a while, so I'll see what I can do about writing a MaxScript.

Thanks guys. Not model related but I found some music data in the .pak files. They are in .snd but all you need to do is change the extension to .mp3 or .wav and it works. Been wanting some clean music rips for a while. The bonus round music is seperated into two parts and I'm putting them together with audacity. This one is just a sample file of the music I found.
