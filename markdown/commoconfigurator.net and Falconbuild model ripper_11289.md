- Post Title: commoconfigurator.net/ and Falconbuild model ripper?

hello forums.

 I am american who is in love with Australian Muscle cars,sedans,wagons,utes. a fellow pointed me to the two sites mentioned above and I've started to inspect them for elements that might lead me to a model format with which to ask you all for help translating into a useable format.

 but I am hitting a bit of a wall here. and for the record, as always these models aren't simply just going to be converted. I have nothing against converters at all I just like to make or remake the models myself so that I can take some pride in my work that would be available to the community.

 anyways here's the sites any help or greasemokey scripts would be greatly appreciated. I'd offer money but sadly I don't have anything for now but I'd be willing to work my ass off for whomever can make the dreams of not just me but many others a reality.

[http://falconbuilder.net/](http://falconbuilder.net/)

[http://commoconfigurator.net/](http://commoconfigurator.net/)

 any help would be greatly appreciated as these are cars who's days in gaming are long over due. thank you for your time.
