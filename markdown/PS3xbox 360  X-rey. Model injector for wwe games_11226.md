What does the program do?:

- Opens yobj model files (New format for now. Older format opens but is buggy)

- Previews sub objects of the yobj file

- Applies textures to preview (png, jpg and bmp format only)

- Import edited wavefront object files from 3dsmax (allowing you to change the shape of yobj files)

- Import texture coordinates from wavefront files

- Export to wavefront object format

At present most I am still coding some of the above functionality and will still need to test everything. I have tested imports on my Benoit mod and Goldberg mods already.


What the program does not do:


- Open pac files or extract yobj from pac files (you should use X-Packer, quickbms, etc for this)

- Convert old model formats into the new format. I will be looking into this later but for now consider this impossible to do.


Pre Requisite Software:

You will need to install the SlimDX toolkit as a pre requisite for this program to work. The toolkit can be downloaded here: [http://code.google.com/p/slimdx/downloa ... 012%29.msi](http://code.google.com/p/slimdx/downloads/detail?name=SlimDX%20SDK%20%28January%202012%29.msi)

Here are some screenshots:
