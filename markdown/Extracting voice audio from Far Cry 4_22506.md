I'm having a really difficult time extracting the voice audio from FC4. Can someone help me out with this issue? I have the Far Cry 4 sound.dat and sound.fat files and I unpack them with the dunia tools and when it extracts from it it's only .sbao files and I have no clue what to do next. Am I supposed to be able to open these files or convert them or extract from them?

I also tried Ravioli extractor tool and it only extracts .ogx files which VLC player and foobar cannot play so I have no clue what these files are tbh. There are also 15k+ files (just named after numbers, no names) and some are broken when extracting with this tool and no clue if it's normal. Extracting from any other file did give me audio files but less than 4k and it's just NPCs.

The wwise unpacker is not compatible either so I'm at a loss here.
