- Post Title: .wem to .bnk files?

I have changed a sound from a game and used Wwise to convert from .wav to .wem

The sound files are extracted from a .bnk file, how do I repack the .wem back into the .bnk?

I really don't know how to use Wwise aside from converting to .wav/.wev

I have looked for tutorials but nothing this specific.

If it matters the game is Mafia Definitive Edition.

I made tool, try it. Run it in cmd, pass path to bnk and paths to wems or directories with wems. It looks in bnk for such wems and replaces them if found. Make sure wem names are their original IDs. I tested it a bit in DOOM 2016 and it works. Still, it may fail if bnk structure somehow changed with different wwise versions or your wem is differs from game's (I tried just swapping some game sounds), so make sure to backup your bnk. Hope it works, [Link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ROrsbpW_Rw0iiefyXLEfQz0X7dEZHCwM/view)

Love to hear if this works as I'd love to replace the boring "Funiculi Funicula" in "Fair Play" with the Spider-Man 2 rendition.

Also [this](https://github.com/hpxro7/wwiseutil) looks promising

I actually tried that on Mafia Definitive Edition audio files recently, and opening them PCKs gives me an error. That ought to be updated to support MDE I must say.

Ok I updated tool, now it can repack bnks and wems into pck. Once again tested with DOOM 2016 and it works but no garanties. Try it and tell me if it works. Link is same in few posts above.
