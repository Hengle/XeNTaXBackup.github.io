Hello guys, Here i have provided information in a rar file regarding the XBOX2_def file for audio in this game. I have attached a 15mb cut off the beginning and a footer which has the filename tables. I could not upload the file as it is 1.28Gigs big, i also included audio that has to be a Mix of PCM and XMA, which has the LIPS header information before it.
