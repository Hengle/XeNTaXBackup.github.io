- Post Title: Invizimals: The Lost Kingdom .PAK, .PAC, .BLI file help

I have extracted contents from Invizimalz on PS3, the only folders in here are all Level folders or Other which have files like Globals.psarc, i have no idea where the models are actually stored but every file seems to have .PAK, .PAC, .BNK, .BLH and .BLI (which may be textures since there is 1 as textures01.bli) anyways I tried any tools I researched on .pac or .pak, couldn't find much on .bli format at all so I figured I'd ask for help here, these files were in globals and it is the name of the main character, idk what they contain or what they are, anyone here able to find out?
