- Post Title: .bin files from Bandai Namco Ent game

I need some help in decompressing/decrypting .bin files I got from an RPG game made by Bandai Namco Ent so it has readable strings.
In the given dropbox link you can find a folder containing character.bin and character_old.bin file.

The character.bin is a new file which has some sort of compression applied to it, but last year the game does not compress these files, so character_old.bin file is the old file from last year that is not compressed and I think this may help us know more about the .bin files' structure.

I also included the lib folder I extracted from the game's apk files that I think may help?
Dropbox link: [https://www.dropbox.com/sh/ugcw9ixlmcoq ... 4pvYa?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/ugcw9ixlmcoq35z/AABbLmBalgZ764J7v8Lf4pvYa?dl=0)


Can someone help me with this problem?
Note: The game originally has a CCZ encryption (by cocos2D IIRC) (+zlib) which a guy called uFalox helped the community decrypting it, so the .bin file's compression is actually the second layer of compression.


Thank you.
