- Post Title: Folklore .SGD_

Since Folklore models are finally able to be extracted, i was wondering the same about the sound files used in the game. I've gotten a bit of help with this before but then again, it wasn't that much. From what i could gather, Folklore uses .VAG files for it's sounds and there's a string mentioning MYPACK v1.1.3 at the top of the encrypted files. So i'm wondering if you people could help me decrypt the compression format used.

Here's a link to a zip containing the format.

I forgot to include this before hand but I'm going to post a link to the other .SGD_ someone else extracted for me. They ran into an issue in which he could only get about 34 of the listed 37 .VAG files in the archive, so I'm a bit concerned if this is an issue with all .SGD_ files or just that one.

EDIT: Fixed link. Old one was the same as the first post
