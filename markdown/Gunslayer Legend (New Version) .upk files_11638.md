> viewtopic.php?f=16&t=8879&hilit=Gunslayer+Legend
There was a thread called "Gunslayer Legend" here,but after the day Gunslayer Legend has been updated a lot,and the umodel no longer support the game.I asked Gildor a few days ago,and he said unfortunately packages are encrypted,the execution file too.
Does somebody interested in it,anyone can help to extract the files?

btw,this is my first time to make a thread here,my english isnt good enough to chat with your guys well,and if the thread is violation the rules,plz delete it,thanks for the help!

This is some characters files you can download at attachment

PS:If someone want the execution file,I will upload it to other online disk
