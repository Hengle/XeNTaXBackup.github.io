- Post Title: .mesh format similar to diablo immortal models

high-poly mesh that looks similar to diablo immortal III formats
in the header instead of 
```
P3F�Q4H_T2H_T2H
```
, 
```
P3F_N4B_T2F�T4H_B4H
```
 is used.
File samples provided(diablo.mesh as a reference, but the queried mesh is foralltimes.mesh). 

The game is foralltimes, messiah engine

It is the same format, with one minor difference. Triangle indices are stored as DWORDs instead of WORDs.

Is there possibly any script to parse it based on diablo tools or any way to edit it to make it work?

I have no idea.
If it weren't for the point clouds:

For me it doesn't make much sense to use such complex meshes as a starting point. Don't you have simpler ones?

Thing is the game just started using 3d models for collectables and most of them are quite detailed, I’ll try find something smaller though

This script should already be able to do it:
[https://github.com/TaylorMouse/MaxScrip ... rtModel.ms](https://github.com/TaylorMouse/MaxScripts/blob/master/GriffonStudios/Diablo/GriffonStudios_DiabloImmortal_ImportModel.ms)

See, what it's doing.  It's checking to see if there's more than 2^15-1 indices, and if there are, it reads in INTs instead of SHORTs.
But, I think this is buggy, as nobody stores negative indices here.  I think it should be checking for unsigned shorts, which are 2^16-1 (65535).
Unless someone can find a mesh file with vertices between 32767 and 65535 that clarifies this issue.

        local nTotalVerts = readLong stream
        local readshorts = true
        if ( nTotalVerts > 32767 ) then readShorts = false

        for f=1 to nTotalIndices / 3 do (
            if readShorts then 
                append faces (_help.ReadTris stream)
            else
                append faces (_help.ReadIntTris stream)
        )


foralltimes.mesh has vertices over 100k, so the script would read in INTs instead of SHORTs.

Haven't worked with 3ds max in a while but will take a look when I install it back! Thank you so much><

Thanks for that smaller sample, looks very "organic".  
In the midst seems to be the uvs:

Complex one is also simple:

*(the Noesis plugin also works, but it will be slow for your files. (you need to change the loading method, parsing attributes, etc, but I'm too lazy))

It worked wonderfully, thank you so much! 
Also, not a big problem but the uv seems to be flipped? Anyways thanks again><
