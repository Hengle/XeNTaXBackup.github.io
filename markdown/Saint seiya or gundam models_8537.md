- Post Title: Saint seiya or gundam models?

Looking for any model from these 2 game series (either for ps2-ps3 or Xbox).

Anyone successfully got these? If not is there a simple tutorial about how to achieve the ripping and conversion process?

Thanks!

Bump

Nobody? Guess there is no way to rip these models from these games?

Try using the search, it was raised a few weeks ago, for papercraft purposes.

That was my first step 

Found a thread, but there were only questions without a single link to the models, nor to the way and tools to rip them.
