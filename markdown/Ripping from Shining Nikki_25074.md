- Post Title: Ripping from Shining Nikki?

Hey there! Recently I've been trying desperately and failing to get a full file dump from the mobile game Shining Nikki. I've gone through every folder on the storage in Nox android emulator that I can but I haven't been able to find the full number of files that I know are definitely in the game. I can only ever manage to get a handfull of things, definitely not the 900mb+ of files the game downloads on a clean first launch. Does anyone know how else I can do this? Should I try messing around with Fiddler to maybe download the files directly from the server? If so does anyone have any advice for that? I've only ever used it to get IMAS files with the help of a tutorial so I'm not really sure how to adapt that method to other games...ty in advance for any help!

the 900+ thing it downloads are the costumes an stuff. you just can't load them cause you need to delete the first 7/8 bytes of each file and save it as unity3d
rigs are messy, most times absent and not all models have textures.
