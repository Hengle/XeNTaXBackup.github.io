- Post Title: Child Of Eden x360 Models

Hi, I want extract models from this game.
I think enemies models are in files like this one:

[http://hotfile.com/dl/127210469/fd35c3c ... y.rar.html](http://hotfile.com/dl/127210469/fd35c3c/ene_bty_02_mdl_body.rar.html)

I can extract texture with File Scanner by Turfster
