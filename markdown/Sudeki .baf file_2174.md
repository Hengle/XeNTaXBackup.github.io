hi, i was wondering if you were still interested in this game

i did successfully extract some textures from this game....
using the hex editor.... by extracting the data directly from the file...
the textures use the one of the DXT texture formats (cant remember which)

not sure... but i think they have a modified DXT header... 

thou i didnt try to figure out the structure of the BAF archives
i know that its uncompressed thou
just need to figure out the headers (and if they exist tails).....
because i know that i would be interested in modding this game also

i could probably take a look at it when get back home
