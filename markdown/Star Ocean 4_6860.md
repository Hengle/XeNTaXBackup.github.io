I am working on star ocean 4 and am nearing the end.
I just thought i would post some screenshots to show the progress.
This game has more vertex types then i can count so it will take me a little bit to get all the models with uv's (if someone good with models wants to help that is even better ).

Awesome, you got back to it again.

Any tips on how to sift through all those files that the quickbms scripts extract, to get the main character files? Also, I haven't ripped the game yet but Resonance of Fate uses the same engine, do you think they would use the same file formats for the archives and models/textures? I remember someone (probably you) saying that it's encrypted.

Nice.  Could you post the tools you used to rip the models? ^^"

EDIT: Will this script work to rip the models from the PS3 version or Xbox 360 ISO?

EDIT: I managed to extract the contents till we get .unslz and ADTS files but,can you tell me that how can i extract the models from unslz files to view them on 3DS Max? ^^"

Any new updates on this? I managed to get a copy of the game from a friend who was done with it. I'm really keen on messing around with the models!

Bones,weights, position of objects are still not finished.
Hello. Any updates about the UV and objects position? I'm more interested in the correct UV's, some of the main characters don't have UV for some parts, like Myuria hair and torso.
Thanks in advance.

Updated script
Now it will load bones and position the model pieces correctly.
Note that bone loading is experimental some of the physics bones are wrong but you can still get a mostly good main skeleton if you manually delete those bones.
the script will throw an error message on static objects because there are no bones but it will still import the mesh fine.

Cool!
Also, I noticed some models' bones have negative bone parent IDs.

That text only list of bones at the very end of the above mentioned file corresponds to bones in the file for Meracle's body
and in the same order. I'm guessing since her claws have the same bone layout as her hand (which makes sense) it's just re-using those.

I follow TheDude video tutorials and are amazing clearly, but bad for me he made the tutorials with PS game and i have X360 game, in the lasts steps he go to the unpacked folder content and he have .ASF files, but i have  .UNSLZ files, then he import with the chroxxx maxscript but of course i cant coz the script its for .ASF files, something idea abouth how to fix this and convert UNSLZ to ASF or unpack?. thanks


P.D. Please dont tell me download the PS game version, its 21 GB and i have only 72kbps.  

Updated, its fixed the problem its this its the last line of TheDude:
Open a command window to use xbdecompress.
Example: xbdecompress 15.unslz 15_out
he forget put 15_out.ASF (ASF FORMAT)
Thanks to TheDude by this greath Tutos he made.

I'm not sure, but that might give everything an ASF extension (regardless if it's an ASF file or not).
Of course it doesn't matter as long as you know what files you're after.

This its a folder with models and textures, chroxxx made the importer for max but this its not finished coz load textures doesnt work, btw nobody made a texture viewer or converter, then i put here the files necesary to test, maybe this can work in Noesis, models and textures have .ASF format, i put also the conversors and this its the lines to convert models and textures to redeable format, only textures need be fixed.

Open a command window to use xbdecompress.exe, write xbdecompress.exe 15.unslz 15_out.ASF
And u get the files, someone hare .ASF models and others are .ASF Textures.
