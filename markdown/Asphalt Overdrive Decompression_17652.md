- Post Title: Asphalt Overdrive Decompression

An experimental BMS script for AO archives.

Features: 
Decompressing .pig & .tga files from the PKZip archives in the dlcs folder.
Converting all .tga files, including all files in .tga__alpha format, to ordinary pvr textures.

Usage:
Select any supported type of files as input, or just type in *.* for all files in the target folder. The script will filter them automatically.

You still need PIG2FBX to handle those PIGs. Have fun!

Nope. I think I've just had enough of racing games. Plus, those models make no difference to me neither.
