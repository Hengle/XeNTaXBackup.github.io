Nice for Unrigged Mesh Data. Wondering how to get the Textures. TetureFinder Kinda works but the Colors are distorted.

Some Textures come out fine others don't it's as if some texture are different formats.

edit: I think it because they should have an Alpha channel.

To extract the textures you need the PVRTexTool and configure it as in the image below. Credits for method of extraction of the texture by Bigchillghost.

Actually you don't have to do it manually. 
I've already posted a probable structure of the texture sample in your previous thread. The reason why I showed you these methods is to 
let you help yourself. With a little bit patience, you alll can manage to do it. But seems not everyone has the passion.

You're right, I had a bit of trouble in your tutorial but finally I understood the procedure, it works perfectly. I thank you once again for your help.

you upload more .texture samples for comparison so a script can be made.

surely you have more than 4 unique .texture files in this game?   
anyway here is Noesis python script to open those based on Bigchillghost's findings

Is there any way to convert the .prefab files to .fbx? With the armatures, if possible?

this could be an animation file - maybe there's a separate file containing the skeleton?

It's also possible that the skeleton data is at 0x1C8230.
But wait, I don't see waist there, so: no.

bonenames:
JointRoot/Hip/Waist/Chest/Shoulder_R/ArmUp_R/ArmDown_R/Hand_R/HandArm_GRG00_R_A/HandArm_GRG00_R_B/HandArm_GRG00_R_C

JointRoot/Hip/Waist/Chest/Shoulder_L/ArmUp_L/ArmDown_L/Hand_L/WeaponHandTip_L

well, the skeleton is at 1A5C79-1A5EA5, I guess. Maybe some of the following VIS__ bones belong to it, dunno.

Should be possible to build the hierarchy manually (didn't find the parenting ids so far), it's a few bones only, 16 if I didn't miss one.
