- Post Title: War1 Graphics (anyone able to share some info?)

Well, I'm quite aware of the fact, that this game came out more than 10 years ago, still I would like to see its graphic files displayed, since when taking a look at its executable I've found some interesting references, but whether or not the related graphic exists is currently unknown to me.

(Dragon and Catapult Crew are the two references, that I would like to check, the Catapult Crew is a concept, which was resurrected in early Warcraft 2 days, their purpose was, surprise surprise  to move and operate the catapult --> when killed the catapult fell into the hands of the enemy, if he decided, that it's of use to him of course)

So would by chance anyone be able to help me out there?

I would definitely greatly appreciate it... (as I do not even know for sure, which of the files are the graphic-files that info is useful to me as well)

P.S. As a matter of interest.... (changing topic)... there are non-stormlib-using MPQ-extractors, which are compatible with every game, that has ever used that kind of Archive.

The most popular one (as it has a namebreaker integrated as well --> extremely useful, when it comes to the decryption of file-names) is Ladislav Zezula's MPQ Editor (current Version 1.7), which is available at the download-section of [http://www.zezula.net/](http://www.zezula.net/) (select the english website version if you're not fluent in czech  )

The source-code can also be downloaded there as well as a in some cases complete Listfiles (Listfile = textfile, that contains the filepaths for the related MPQ-Archive) for Diablo I Beta/Retail + Hellfire (all complete), Diablo II + LoD (complete for 1.10), Lords of Magic SE (nearly complete), Starcraft + Broodwar (nearly complete for 1.10), Warcraft II + Exp. (nearly complete), Warcraft III (complete for 1.13) & World of Warcraft (complete for 1.2.1) --> you can always use the namebreaker-tool to discover some more filenames  ... I could share a Listfile for the Diablo PrDemo, which is a 1-Level Demo using a late Alpha-Built Interface and the Starcraft & Broodwar Beta.

P.P.S. I'm trying to create a site, which pretty much shows everything, that didn't make it into the first two Warcraft-Games something like my starcraft-themed partner-site, which is going to be updated quite soon: [http://home.planet.nl/~aggel005/alphabeta/index.html](http://home.planet.nl/~aggel005/alphabeta/index.html) (a diablo1-themed site is also in existence, but it just isn't as complete to go public right now)

Also the offering of Blizzard-Betas is planned... so this really is a serious request.
