- Post Title: DUST 514 PS3

This game is only released at PSN, and downloadable to PS3 only, Free to Play.

This is made with Unreal Engine, so we can try UE Viewer for this game.

But how to get the files into PC ?

PSN doesn't allow to download the game to PC.

And I am not able to find this game any where else.

Any body knows, how to copy the downloaded game from PS3 to PC? (But I don't have PS3 so no way to reserch.)

If any body interested on this game, then please share what we can do.

Or if anybody have the game downloaded to PS3, can try to Copy the files to PC and help us.
