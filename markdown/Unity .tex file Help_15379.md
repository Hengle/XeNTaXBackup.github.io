Look dude. Begging people for this stuff isn't going to help. Especially since you never were one to thank others for something, at least, verbally.
If you want it so bad, I'd at least suggest learning how to code Python or even learn how to code with BMS.

Hi PhillipGamer3264 no need to be demanding. I understand your frustration that nobody has responded. Please understand it may take some time. It usually helps if you provide as many details as possible (i.e what game etc) as it may interest someone. Also, Unity is a known engine I would suggest searching around (maybe someone already made a tex extractor). 

I will be keeping an eye on this thread.
Cheers.
