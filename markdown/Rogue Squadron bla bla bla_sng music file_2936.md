- Post Title: Rogue Squadron bla bla bla_sng music file

I extracted files of this type from ROGUE.DAT using watto studios Game Extractor. I this a type of .sng file, just without extension? I researched something about the format being MuSyX. Is there a generic player or converter that can make this into a soundcard playable file such as midi?
