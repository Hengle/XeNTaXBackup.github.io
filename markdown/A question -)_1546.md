Well, they are sort of archives, yes, but also installers. Self-extracting to be precise. 

Installers can have protection by registration codes. In that case it would be a violation of copyright to retrieve files without consent.

Hi mate,

We can have a look at them if you like, however the problem with installer archives is that they love to make up their own compression algorithms rather than using standard ones - so at best we could probably get the compressed files, but we wouldn't be able to decompress them unless it is a standard type.

If you want us to have a look at some files, perhaps try to find us some small archives. Or even better would be if you could make up some small archives yourself in each of the different installers.

We will help if at all possible - I'm not sure about the registration code things that Mr Mouse mentioned, but we obviously won't be writing any code to break apart protected archives or what-have-you.
