So from aluigi's site I see this tool. I also saw him referencing it in the password-finding thread.
From the description it seems like something really cool.

No, but it sounds like something useful if you like to work with raw PE files. Something similar I've been using is CFF Explorer, which has support for .NET assemblies.
