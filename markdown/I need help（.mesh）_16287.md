It sounds funny, you don't know which program uses your file.

Where did you find this file?

Oh, my friend, my English is not good. I used the translation tool. The result of translation is not my original intention.
I know the source of the mesh file. I mean, I don't know what tools to use to open these mesh models. I saw the tools you released. Can you help me?  
Here is the game's website and the download address of the game

Hi ~ my friend, because BMS script without access to the file name, can only view to identify mesh in the form of text file, the mesh file header information is consistent, can identify by file size may be mesh format file

This is a game, this game with BMS script can perfect get the name of the file, the game model with the same format, there should be a help to open the model.

Use this a lot of game engine development, these games model format is consistent, but I don't know what to use to open them

If the 3d model looks like this, I must flip the model horizontally.

I added the NetEase Games *.mesh/gim/mtg file format load modules to my program (3D Object Converter v6.508) and released it as a web update.

How to get the latest version of 3D Object Converter:
Please download the 3D Object Converter v6.50 from [http://3doc.i3dconverter.com](http://3doc.i3dconverter.com) and install it or download and use the portable version.
After it use the Help/Check for updates... function to get the latest version of the program.


I converted the .ktx files (Khronos Texture, [https://www.khronos.org/opengles/sdk/tools/KTX/](https://www.khronos.org/opengles/sdk/tools/KTX/)) to .jpg file using the PVRTexTool [https://community.imgtec.com/developers ... vrtextool/](https://community.imgtec.com/developers/powervr/tools/pvrtextool/) from the PowerVR Tools.

Unfortunately the .mtg file has wrong texture file extension (.bmp instead of .ktx).

Workflow:
- I changed the Tools/Options/Import/Default texture file extension (from .bmp to .jpg)
- I opened the .mesh file.
- I used the Tools/Set the default texture file extension in the material table function (to change the .bmp extension to .jpg).
- I exported the model to Wavefront .obj/mtl formats.

Cool. Thank you, Karpati.This is a great job!
Texture is it a JPG?JPG stickers don't have transparent channels, and PNG might be better if it's PNG.

You can convert the .ktx file to .png also using the PVRTexTool.

Thank you very much~! Karpati.
I have been KTX file conversion, MESH format have some problems at present, some MESH format file cannot be open, because there are other affected format to identify parameters of things?  
In addition, the terrain used by the engine is generated by lightmap, the file format appears to be a chunk file, and does your tool support the loading of the terrain?

Netease many games use the same engine, so their MESH format is the same, but some MESH files cannot be loaded, such as this one.

I tracked down what was the problem and I modified the NetEase Games *.mesh format load module and released it as a web update.
Just use the Help/Check for updates... function to get it.

The load is perfect, but when I export the model to the OBJ file, the exported model is broken, something like that.

As you can see from the graph, the position is disordered.

It is normally, because you are using the program in demo mode.
I think you did not understand completely the message before Wavefront export.

Wow, that's the reason. Does 3D Object Converter support the playback and export of model skeletal animation?
