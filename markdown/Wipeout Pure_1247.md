I have downloaded the file and will take a look at it soon.

Attached is a Game Extractor plugin for this game. This plugin will work in the basic version of Game Extractor, however it will not be able to repack the archives. If you have the Full Version of Game Extractor, please email me and I will send you a plugin with repacking support.

Have fun. Just unzip the attachment into your plugins/ directory.

That's right. But if it's opening of those files you want, you already can. 

Oh wait, perhaps you are trying to evade a possible registration ...!

I have already made a plugin for that game - it is available to full version users. I don't think it will work with the basic version - most plugins won't without me editing them into the old format.
