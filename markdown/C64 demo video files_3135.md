- Post Title: C64 demo video files

I've been capturing some stufff, including this demo.

[http://c64.xentax.com/media/demos/deus_ ... medium.avi](http://c64.xentax.com/media/demos/deus_mpeg_divx_medium.avi) 

Deus Ex Machine is rated #1 at the CSDB ( [http://noname.c64.org/csdb](http://noname.c64.org/csdb) ) 

Note that the captured signal includes areas normally invisible on-screen as the resolution of the C64 is 384x272 and the captured area is larger (PAL). 

I intend to do some more capturing of classic demos. 

Cool stuff that happens in this demo include:
- Full borders opened and used
- FLI graphics (allowing more than the 16 hardware colours of the machine)
- Sync to music 
- Vast array of grafix tricks only possible due to professional coding and full exploitation of the C64s limited capabilities. 

Enjoy!

lol, cool.  I personally think C64s should be used more often in University CS courses.  It would help new programmers to limit their memory usage and what not.  It would be great for game programming ^_^.  This is really cool.  Wish I had a C64 :(.
