《Tiger Knight》 is a "and《Mount & Blade》 similar instant pass game
Game model is great, but I can't use umodelGUI to extract them.
Is there any tools to extract it? I need help
umodel -game=？？？（How to know the parameters of the game name?）
Game:[http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/f ... =230422589](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=230422589)
