Hi guys! Here's maxscript to import PC Lost Planet 2 models with bones (3ds max 2009-2012)

[](http://piccy.info/view3/6247187/4a19e77b1b18f172bd8a4cbca187b36b/1200/)[](http://i.piccy.info/a3c/2014-04-16-05-49/i9-6247187/744x574-r)

P.S. Report bugs, I tested a lot of models, but because of lack of HDD space, deleted the game. It's possible,  that some models could cause troubles - but if you report them, I'll fix script ASAP.
P.P.S. If there's an existing tools/script for Lost Planet 2 - delete this thread  Didn't find them on xentax, but maybe they exist?

Zaramot - Thanks so much for this! I was waiting for this for so long. I tested the script and it works great. 

Do you have a method for converting the textures as well?

use texturefinder  check the *.tex files and with a hexadecimal editor just add a DDS header in the file

The only script I know of for the lost planet games is the one for the original game, there was also a .tex to .dds program as well but I have no idea if it works on the newer file versions. It probably doesn't though.

no idea if this is in any way active anymore, but the script still doesnt work with some of the models, like the one i've included
so if by any chance that anyone still has any interest in lost planet 2 stuff, any help would be HIGHLY appreciated!

for this special mesh there's a very simple workaround: substract -1 in script line 151:

update: darn, i might be doing something wrong, but it's still being wonky for me, and giving me this error:


update 2: nevermind, it worked, i just managed to make a typo and realized it after double checking the maxscript
