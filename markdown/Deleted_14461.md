let me understand.... 

you can view the textures ((YES - since you posted them, but you cannot convert to other formats? ))

i think you may need to go to a new forum and research the basics of model extraction etc, before jumping into something you have no clues on how to proceed with..   maybe try software called PVRTexTool - use google to find it, or search xentax forums for the links. its not hard to find. 

aside of mod disagreements, its good to see you searching the right places for education etc 

welcome to Xentax
