bump 

well, now is possible import x360 models, but textures cant be opened yet.
I attach here 3 pairs (dds-xtx) of textures. maybe is possible to do something. I know nothing of coding, but I can see that xtx textures are kinda bigger than the same dds.

This is a must have imo.  I changed the header and nothing aswell. 


Hopefully someone can solve this.

@shadowmoy: Thanks man, works like a charm. 

If you allow I could upload it to my rapidshare account so its not limited to 10 downloads, I could also do mediafire. Just let me know and ill do it.   
-------

Some of these textures from the Ferrari DLC and comparing over the left over textures on the PC version, I can see they have made badging 512 x 512 on Xbox 360. The F50 GT also has a new badging texture, they also touched up the textures alot more comparing the California badging to the PC left over textures etc. Done very nice job on touching the quality also explains the size most likely.

it works great, im so thankful for your great work. It's amazing that it can also convert forza 3 textures  respect!

the only minor problem i see is that it cuts names and lack of batch converting, but it doesnt bother me at all

Nice work 

Any chance of open-sourcing this or possibly separating it into a dll so I can integrate it into my application?
