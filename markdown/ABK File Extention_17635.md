- Post Title: ABK File Extention

Hello, I am trying to extract or convert an .abk file from NHL 14, a game made by EA for the ps3.  Any idea on how to convert it so I can hear it and replace it with an mp3? Maybe using a BMS script?
Thanks in advance!

Hi! maybe you've tried it already, but using PSound (sound extractor for PS1 games) i was able to open .abk files from MOH Frontline. Although for some reason it doesn't show all the sound files in there e.g.: if there are 20000 sounds inside the .abk, PSound only shows you like 40 or 50 of them or maybe less. I've also tried an NFS_decoder but it crashed everytime i tried to extract the sounds files.
