- Post Title: Offzip doesn't work

I tried to decompress some unity 3d models using Offzip but it just gave me an error (no valid full zip data found)

I was not able to get the static and animated meshes, only textures load with AssetStudio

I'm looking for someone who can help me decompress/decrypt this Unity game 3D models.

Please someone help me.

This is amazing! Can you show how you get the meshes?

this is a manual mesh search, you can use hex2obj or MeshFinder (Android)
I also made a plugin for Noesis. (mesh, uv, weight(skin)bones without parents. )
