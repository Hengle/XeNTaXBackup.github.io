- Post Title: anybody got experience with reversing codecs,esp. EA codecs?

I've been trying to figure out B&B's speech codec for ages.
[viewtopic.php?f=17&t=2756](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=17&t=2756)

Anyone got any tips for finding the function where it gets decoded?
I tried everything, searching for magics and constants that appear in the header etc.

We have a thread for the EA codecs here: [viewtopic.php?f=17&t=4068](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=17&t=4068)
Someone wanted to reverse it, but I think he isn't trying anymore. I don't know. =/
There you can also find some information about the codecs.

Yeah, I know that thread. Doesn't seem like there's much progress though.
