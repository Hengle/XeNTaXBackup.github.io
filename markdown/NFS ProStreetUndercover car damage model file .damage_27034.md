- Post Title: NFS ProStreet/Undercover car damage model file .damage

can anyone look at NFS Undercover .damage model file? I heard that some of reverse-engineers in nfs modding community can't touch/edit this file as these are hardcoded with the game exe.

Sample damage file: [https://mega.nz/file/hPZkmAYA#bBTHhMxA8 ... ap21l6GimM](https://mega.nz/file/hPZkmAYA#bBTHhMxA8Eyh8T1z6rDXdYCFB3SaGqgWPap21l6GimM)

Sample geometry files as an example for correspond to the carname: [https://mega.nz/file/1C5xWS7Y#TKIvQFkMV ... 4WcKWMs5fk](https://mega.nz/file/1C5xWS7Y#TKIvQFkMVylaFUrid_YaN9TohKMPKHFc74WcKWMs5fk)

Since I'm making an addon car mods for Black Box era nfs games, it needs to duplicate the vanilla damage file and rename it to carname. maybe you may have any luck for this one.

EDIT: as for my addon car mods, is it possible to create our own damage model for the specific geometry.bin without copying the original/vanilla files and rename it to addon carnames?
