- Post Title: Resources for learning about Animation Reversing?

Hey guys. Throughout the past several years I've encountered several unexplored animation formats, yet my attempts to reverse them always seem to be halted by the complete lack of documentation on the subject - as far as I've been able to figure out, there are a select few who simply have the knowledge required to reverse animations specifically, and no sources I've been able to find for learning said knowledge.

Anyway, I'm posting here to ask if anyone knows of a "beginner's guide" of sorts for working with unknown animation formats? Writing an importer is something I can do on my own, but nearly every format I've come across has some plaintext at the beginning (typically a version number and/or animation name) with no pattern that I can pick up on beyond that.

Any help would be appreciated. Thanks,
Solaris

I think the best way to learn it would be by example.
Find some animation formats people have already figured out and written code for
and map it all out in a hex editor.
