- Post Title: Autolegends USSR .ovd (Moscow racer)

Hello everyone!  

This game contains unique (and indeed,very nice) models of USSR cars and I found a couple of topics on it on xentax.
Getting the textures out doesn't seem to be a big deal(I used the ninja Ripper to do it) and there's a script for it(as far as I get it right) but the models are still encrypted.

Every single 3D model in game is in .OVD format. 
Here's an example of a car and I included all 4 files that make a car(I beleive,they are camera positions etc.)

I hope that someone can export this format!  

Moreover,I don't think that a tiny Russian game should have complex encription
