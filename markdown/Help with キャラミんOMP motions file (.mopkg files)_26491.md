- Post Title: Help with キャラミんOMP motions file? (.mopkg files)

Hello, Nice to meet you, I need help for extracting the Mopkg files for Charamin OMP ([https://www.charamin.com/](https://www.charamin.com/))

I am lacking code knowledge, I want to extract these .mopkg files to see how they work. 

(Even convert to them to MMD .VMD format to see how they were animated)

Link to the file if this can help you analyze it. : [https://mega.nz/file/MSwRnSAT#beMCYTOZJ ... jkPVsIk2AA](https://mega.nz/file/MSwRnSAT#beMCYTOZJUUr9M_ecDvz_yfDG27STxBJ2jkPVsIk2AA)
(Xentax won't let upload the files, too big apparently)

Thanks to anyone who are willing to help
