[offtopic] Hey, Strobe, good to see you back, and you released a new JN! ! Happy new year! 
There has been the issue of someone suggesting JN is infested with some kind of worm/trojan, have you seen this thread? No need to worry, but the discussion was there some time ago...  [/offtopic]

Hehehehe, yes, ive looked at the massive trojan threads  , Thats why i currently use no compression whatsoever on
anything in the exe! There never was and will never be anything malicious inside JN. Its totally trojan,virus,spyware,malware
free, atleast when it comes from [http://www.jaedernaub.com](http://www.jaedernaub.com) =D
