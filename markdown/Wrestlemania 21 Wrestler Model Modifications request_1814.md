I have dwnloaded those files before, and looked around to find some informations about the gmae. It appears that it is port of the game from Xbox and there is forum discussing some modding. But mostly mods are by changing the textures on models and not models itself. To put it in the other words - "k" 3D format appears so far to be a big mystery.

I said in another thread that I had originally went through it before on another forum. Unfortunately the interest just wasn't there so I dropped it,

writing up specs for models and animation is no small task. So unless I'd see some actual use come out of it then I wouldn't touch it. This goes for any game.
