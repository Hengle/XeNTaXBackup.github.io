Same format as Revelation Online. You may be able to put this script to use : [viewtopic.php?p=126589#p126589](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?p=126589#p126589) You will need to properly change the file extensions to ".visual" and ".primitives".

Speaking based on the blender script, your samples are all ".primitives". You have to find the ".visual" files for those. It might be hard since you seem to have no extensions. Check the files in the hex editor. I have attached examples for .visual and .primitives.

Too hard，I don't know how to difference them in the hex editor.And I don't  know how to use .primitives .visual in blender... 
Through your files，I find .dat in the hex editor have many message such as "biped""bone"....and when I change the file extensions to ".visual",I Still can't open it.I don't know WHAT .primitives IS，and how to use his method to import     

Oh!great!I find one .visual!It is successfully to import!but...how to use .primitives?

Don't try many tools  Just use this blender script : [viewtopic.php?p=126589#p126589](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?p=126589#p126589)

You don't load the primitives directly. .primitives and .visual are a pair, meaning each primitives have a visual file. So you find those pairs and give them the same name like : "test.primitives" and "test.visual". Then you just load the .visual file, and it will load the primitives automatically. Finding the correct primitives/visual pairs is up to you.

ok，I think I understand.Thanks.
......but files is tooooooo many!Do you have good ideas to difference them？
Or，because all files has been renamed，and I think also have many files in .bag not get.Have better one to unpack .bag?So it can be difference.

In fact,I can't  find any prompt to tell me this .primitives and .visual is a pair in the hex editor  ........all files has been renamed.
Files is toooooooooooooooo many!

Can you successfully decompress? I also need to extract the Netease game. This is the .dat file. You can try to extract it

First of all: why the heck did you open a second thread on X-Heros? I'll ignore it.

Finding the pairs? Guess it can be done using the vertex count value.
