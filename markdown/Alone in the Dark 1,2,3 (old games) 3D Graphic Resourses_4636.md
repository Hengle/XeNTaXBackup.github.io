I remember the Mac demo for this in 1995, more than 20 years ago, and I still have the disc.....
Near the beginning of the file is a 4ByteInteger representing the number of Vertexes, then about 6 bytes later (this might vary slightly) are the vertexes which are stored as 2ByteSignedIntegers. The rest of the file needs some more close examination, which I will do in a little while.

There's an open source remake of the engine, once abandoned but now relocated at [http://code.google.com/p/fitd-reloaded/](http://code.google.com/p/fitd-reloaded/)
Whatever information you need to read models is in there, though it's gonna take a bit of sifting through the sources.
