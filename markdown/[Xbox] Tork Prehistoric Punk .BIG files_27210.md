- Post Title: [Xbox] Tork: Prehistoric Punk *.BIG files

Hello XeNTaX community,

I'm trying to extract music from the Xbox exclusive "Tork: Prehistoric Punk". While I can extract audio with Audacity by analyzing the files in raw mode, I'd like to have direct access to them.

I'm absolutely clueless how to extract these files and game extractors don't work with the *.big format (probably compressed/encrypted?). The game works with xemu (the LLE Xbox emulator).

I've uploaded the files on this MEGA folder is anyone is willing to take a look.

Thanks in advance!
