The only help I guess I could be is to tell you that games with custom fonts (one of the few that doesn't use custom is half-life 2, it just uses Arial renamed and stored as a standard ttf) normally only store the relevant letters for the launguages it supports in the texture/image files, normally as a sheet of letters. You'd probably also need to modify the textures and such. How? I haven't the foggiest.
