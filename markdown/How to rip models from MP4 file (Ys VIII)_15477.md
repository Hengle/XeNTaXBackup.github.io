- Post Title: How to rip models from MP4 file? (Ys VIII)

I'm trying to rip 3D character models from the game "Ys VIII" just released few months ago for PS Vita.
I have a set of files(link below) consisting of .vpk and .mp4 files, which PSV users use to run on their devices.
since .mp4(3.3gb) is much bigger than .vpk(few mb), i'm pretty sure all the core files - including 3d models - are inside rootast.mp4, but I have no idea how to convert it to any unzippable format or to extract 3d model files out of it.

The guy who shared the file mentioned that the extension of rootast.mp4 file should be changed to .xai before put into vita device. This could be a hint? Never heard of .xai extension though, lol...
Any help is appreciated.
