Hello, i wanted extract some audio files from this old game but have a problem with their format. I found only one program that can see them but even in that case it says that its not .wcp or file has errors. I suggest that this file is coded but i have no idea how to open it. To be honest i have this problem on all audio files from this game  Maybe some one figure out how to open it. I just need some voicelines from there.
I left the link on file below so you can download archive and watch this format:

Will be very much appreciated if you figure out how open it

Ah sheesh figure out. Import this files as RAW in Audacity and it seems that it works. I try this method with other files and say work this on all of them or not.

Also .wcp files seems not work well but .sbk files perform sound as it should be.

Problem is still has place. Audacity can't correctly play Raw data sound some sound play good some not and causes blood from my ears. For example if import .wcp file for replay you can hear the sound it maybe very slowed. And in sound lenth you can see some sound artifacts. I solve some problem with decoding choose variants but still sound has sound glitches.

Upd. The sound is relatively clear on Signed 32-bit PCM encoding but still has audio artifacts. At least already something.

The files in your link don't contain any audio - the wcp file is very small (and compressed) and the sbk file is blank.

Thanks. I found some audio files in .str format and it seems they work fine. But some of files stored in .wcp and .sbk they played with scritches and artifacts when i launch them here new source [https://mega.nz/file/PMtDjAKT#ABYQjd8sJ ...
