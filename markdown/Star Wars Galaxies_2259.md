- Post Title: Star Wars Galaxies?

Well I did a google search for the TRE opener and I found a thread on this forum, I downloaded everything there was to download but I have absolutely NO clue as to what to do. I'm a texturer and I need those for an EMU server. Can someone please explain how do I get from all of those .zips with folders, to textures in my texture folder?

EDIT: I spoke too soon, I think I know how to open it, but when I try to it tells me Run-time error '9':
            Subscript out of range

EDIT: Ok I found something in a thread, copy&pasted it into the eul.txt and now it works, NOW can someone please link me to a DDS opener? Because that's how the files are.

You mean Microsoft DDS? If that's the case, I'm sure another Google search will turn up an editor.

As for the TRE viewer documentation, you're not the first person who'se asked about it, it's all rather spread out here, isn't it?

Hmm I did a google search and nothing came up, mainly clans and other random things, I found a tutorial on how to be able to get DDS opened with Photoshop 7.0 but I have 9.0 (CS2) and it didn't work.
