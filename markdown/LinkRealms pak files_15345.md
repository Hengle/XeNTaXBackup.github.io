been digging around and was able to pull all the item id's by exploiting the Map Editor files and replacing the ID numbers, also i realized while i was doing this that the Editor had access to the pak files so i loaded it in Olly (i can't read asm) but i did find 1.1.4 Mark Adler and googled that its from Zlib and im doing some more digging if anyone wants to help that would be awesome!
