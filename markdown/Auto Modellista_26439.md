I know nothing about coding so I'm really hoping somebody can help me extract the handling data files for this game so I can fix the notoriously bad car handling in this game. It has such great potential with those excellent cel-shaded graphics and there's nothing else like it in the genre. I've even tried hiring a programmer but it seems like they don't want to touch it even though it's abandonware at this point.

Apparently the game has a debug symbol left behind, which I've heard can aid in extracting the files.
