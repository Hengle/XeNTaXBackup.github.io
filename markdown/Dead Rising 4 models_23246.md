- Post Title: Dead Rising 4 models

Been trying to extract some specific models from Dead Rising 4, more specifically, the Amaterasu costume that comes with the Capcom Heroes mode so I could have some characters of mine wear it. I already have the textures,  I just need the model itself. I had the most success with Ninja Ripper up until i went to view the models in Noesis, where I found out that the UV maps were messed up. There is a 3DS max plugin for importing the game's .mdl files, but I dont use 3ds max (I use Blender FYI), and I dont feel like searching for a compatible version of 3ds max right now all for one model, because apparently it only works with 3ds 2009 - 2014. There's also some modding tools for the game somebody made that can extract models, but instructions for using them are non-existent and I'm stuck not knowing how to use them.

So yeah, at this point IDK what to do. Maybe somebody can convert the model for me? I have the .mdl file itself here. I'll also link the 3ds max plugin.

You can use Model Researcher if you just want to export an .obj file, with these settings for vertices, faces and UVs:





I'm not sure if there are other meshes in that file or not ...

Thanks man, I really appreciate the help. I've got the model imported into Blender with proper UVs and textures. Now I just need to get the rest of the models obviously, but I can do that myself.

I just realized that the costume was in a few seperate meshes. I uploaded the rest of them to google drive.
