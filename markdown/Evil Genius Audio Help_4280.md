Hey

Can anyone help, I got this file out of the evil genius .erb and me, OrangeC and Kataah all agree that this is something special.

Any news?   

P.S. It's already 6 years passed and extractor still doesn't exist?! Holy Christ!

I think I'm going to resurrect this thread  

I've created a program to decode the audio from this game (I like to call the codec 'TSubBand'). You can download it at [this link](http://www.box.net/shared/zznvixe27b). I can't say it's fully tested, but it should work. After extracting the files from the .erb resource, run it with:

```
DecodeTSubBand InputFilename.wav.TSubBandResource.bin OutputFilename.wav
```

Edit: Added external link

Thanks, Zench!

I, also think many other things so long for it waited.

Once again thanks!

Apologies for necroing this thread once again, but it seems that the download for this tool has been lost. Anyone have a copy they can host?
