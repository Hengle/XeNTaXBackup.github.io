- Post Title: Ninja Ripper: Harry Potter models messed up

Hi. Lately I have been having problems with Ninja Ripper. When I try to rip models and convert them to .obj or .fbx they will either appear as a square, stretched out, or random shapes. I am using a PS2 emulator called PCSX2 and the game I am using is Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone. Ninja Ripper had never had this problem before but now it is. The key I use for the models is F11. I also  have a feeling that some people will recommend 3D Ripper DX but that doesn't work for me at all. Any advice is appreciated.

Its a problem with PCSX2 i believe, in the way it renders things.
