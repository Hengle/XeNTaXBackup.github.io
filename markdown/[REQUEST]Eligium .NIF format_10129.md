- Post Title: [REQUEST]Eligium .NIF format

Hello guys *--*

Well, I tried to use NifSkope to open some *.nif files from Eligium ( Magic World Online 2 ), but i can't see any model    . So when i searched for Nif file format, I found one list with games supported by Nif tools, and, unfortunately, Eligium isn't in this list =(

So guys if someone help me (convert the *.nif format to use in 3DS Max) , I will be happy *-* . I will upload a rar file with 3 models. ( 3 folders, with contain *.kf, *.kfm, *.nif and *.h file ).

I think someone should provide an easy-to-understand guide to updating that XML file.

Parsing the format probably isn't difficult since the main structure is pretty much given (well, there will be a bunch of unknowns), but all that matters is being able to parse what's important right...?

> So guys if someone help me (convert the *.nif format to use in 3DS Max)It's Nif version 20.5.0.0. Don't know why NifSkope 1.1.3 doesn't display the model, so here is the skeleton.nif converted to a Wavefront-obj:
