Hi everyone,
As the format seems to be identical to ONE PIECE KAIZOKU, is anyone up to extract all these awesome models? This should even cover up if devs locked more content on disk as well!

Thanks

if anyone wants to try i can send anyone a buildable build of my source code for one piece and the HLSL shaders from dynasty warriors 7. i just don't have the time and the fact that even reversing the shaders lead to nowhere to solve the cloth problem (you still need to know what constants are being sent to the shader and it's [HLSL ASM](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/hh447232%28v=vs.85%29.aspx) which isn't very fun to look at).
