- Post Title: Naruto to Boruto: Shinobi Striker (Trying to extract Audio)

Good Evening, I'm trying to extract the Audio files from this game and I'm guessing they're in the PAK files (pakchunk0-WindowsNoEditor and pakchunk1-WindowsNoEditor). I've downloaded 'Game Extractor' but when I try to open them the app says "No plugins were able to open the archive". Anyone have any clue about what I should do or if these have already been extracted? I'm trying to get the English audio.

According to google, this game runs on Unreal Engine, 
which means it probably uses standard UE4 PAK file format described here [http://wiki.xentax.com/index.php/Unreal_Engine_4_PAK](http://wiki.xentax.com/index.php/Unreal_Engine_4_PAK)

You can try to use some tools listed in the "Compatible programs" section
