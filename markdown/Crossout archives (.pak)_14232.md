- Post Title: Crossout archives (.pak)

Hello! 

I've been trying to open the Crossout ([http://crossout.net/en](http://crossout.net/en)) data files, all neatly ordered and name (.pak, file names are very descriptive: Gamedata, textures, etc.), but none of the ready-made tools such as Dragon UnPacker or GameExtractor work with this specific .pak format. 

Anyone have pointers or ideas on where to start?

 if it's anything like the quake III .pak format then the .pak is just another compressed archive format. try backing up all the files. then copy one to a new folder. rename it a ".zip" or ."rar" format and then extract it. then you should have the true file format that the files are in IF this is the same .pak format as found in quake III's .pak files.

 try that and let me know it if was opened that way.

I wouldn't be posting here if I could do that. 

I though it might be the same thing as FOT a while back, but no dice. 7zip doesn't cut it, Dragon, Game Extractor, etc.
