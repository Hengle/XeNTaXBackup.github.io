- Post Title: Tsunami 2265 .mef importer

I have added the Tsunami 2265 .mf loader module to the 3D Object Converter.
Just use the Help/Check for updatesâ€¦ function to get this version.

The textures are in the .mef files also, my program extracts these into external .bmp files (with reserving the filenames) automatically during the loading time and assigns these to the models based on the Options/Import/Tsunami 2265 .mef parameter.
