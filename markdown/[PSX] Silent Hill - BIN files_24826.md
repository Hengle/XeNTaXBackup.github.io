- Post Title: [PSX] Silent Hill - BIN files

Hello everyone!
I apologize to everyone in advance for my text, I am writing through a translator!

Recently, I decided to realize my childhood dream - to walk through the streets of "Silent hill" and look at everything that is in this city from the first person (and not from above or in camera angles set by the developers).

I'm having difficulty "removing" the map from the game. I searched all over the Internet, but I didn't really find anything. All I have at the moment is the nickname of the person who was able to get the card from the game (Giromancy).

I couldn't find the information to contact him either. The last hope is for you. I ask for your help! Below I will attach the information on working with game files that I currently own!

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I downloaded the image (Silent Hill [SLUS-00707]) and unpacked it. After unpacking, I received several files:
>HILL
>SILENT
>SLUS_007.07
>SYSTEM.CFG

After unpacking the files [Silent Hill - Tools] I got the following:

It looks like the map is stored in the VIN folders in files with the extension .BIN and I can't even imagine how you can get it from there.

Here is a list of tools for working with game files that I could find:
