- Post Title: LocoRoco *.ARC archive

Hi!
This is my 1st thread on XeNTaX.Like others,i have also come here with a view to exploring many resources.(and no,not gonna do anything illegal)So,lets start with a resource for which i have been dying hard to break through.This Game is of the PSP console/Details--
Game : LocoRoco 2 (DEMO)
Region : USA
Compressed : Yes (probably)
IDString/Header : GPRS...GARC
Similiar Games using this Format : LocoRoco : Midnight Carnival
Similiar Resources : GPRS...GARC (Uncompressed) [LocoRoco 1]
                     GPRS...KKBF (LocoRoco : Midnight Carnival DLC)

However i can't provide you with the similiar ones(GPRS...GARC (Uncomp.)-Im not interested)(GPRS...KKBF-Not legally distributable)
Here's a legit link to the files---[https://mega.co.nz/#!JVcClKiL!f9UfeB0Z- ... yyqNCTRRcI](https://mega.co.nz/#!JVcClKiL!f9UfeB0Z-rJYujKkWG1bZH3LaeonoIV8JyyqNCTRRcI)
there are 2 resources in the demo(30MB).
according to aluigi-"compression not so complex,but not luck with my scanner"
as far as know,there are at3 files with the RIFF header in the archive.
