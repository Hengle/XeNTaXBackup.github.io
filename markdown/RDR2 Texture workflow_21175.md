- Post Title: RDR2 Texture workflow

I've done mods with PBR textures from a few games, but I am a bit baffled by the RDR2 ones I've seen.  For example, I'm not sure how to apply the _Ma or _Mb textures (in my experience those sorts of textures need to be decomposed into their constituent shaders like metalness and roughness, but I'm  not sure if that applies here.

Thanks for any tips
