- Post Title: [PSP] GOD EATER package.rdp

Hi all,
just stumbled upon the package.rdp of GOD EATER, a japanese Action-RPG that has just been released in Japan.
I am wondering if somebody could take a look at the package.rdp that seems to contain various file types like:
- GIM Texture
- GOM Model
- AT3 encoded WAV
- PNG Images (for savegame)
- obc, sps + blt files (don't know their purpose... seem to be game specific)

It starts with an ELF header and contains simple text like Item names and dialogues as well. So a all-in-one package.
BTW: I stumble upon 4.0.4+allegrex-2.2.3-psp-2.9.0 pretty often, maybe sb knows what this is.

Due to my slow internet I am sorry to be unable to upload that 1GB huge file   
Maybe sb who owns this game or got it otherwise wants to take a look 

greets

That will help if you have a slow connection. So you can provide files too.

Download Watto's Filecutter from here:

[download/file.php?id=2762](http://forum.xentax.com/download/file.php?id=2762)

In the line where it says "Archive To Analyze" click "Select" and choose the file you want to be analyzed.

In the next line it says "Output archive name", here you can rename the name of the output file or change the path where it gets saved. Best thing is to leave the standard path which is chosen automatically.

In the third line it says "Amount of data to copy", click on the arrow to open the drop down menu and choose "2MBs".

Now you only have to click on "Create Analysis Archive".

After the program finished cutting the important parts of the file, close the programm and upload the archive the program created to sendpace.com
