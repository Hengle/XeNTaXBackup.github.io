- Post Title: Marvel vs. Capcom: Infinite .uasset

MVC Infinite's audio/movie files are separate from it's unreal 4 .pak archive. Individual files seem to be encrypted and many of them are split between having a .uasset file and its original file with the same filename. (.usm video, .acb audio archive, etc) 

5 files from the game: (.usm video with matching .uasset, .acb archive with matching .uasset, and .uasset that has no matching file)

Desencriptaste ambos paks con el ejecutable de godskin??.

Veo que hablas español, a mí me funcionó bastante bien después de desencriptarlos o tus archivos están corruptos.
