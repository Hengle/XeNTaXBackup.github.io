- Post Title: Corpse Party English (PSP) Font Bitmap Extraction?

Does anyone know how to extract the font bitmap file from the PSP Corpse Party games (Either Corpse Party or Book of Shadows since they use the same font.

I've attempted to unpack the game's files but it doesn't appear in the image.bin archive, and I wouldn't know where to begin looking in any of the other files. Can someone help me?
