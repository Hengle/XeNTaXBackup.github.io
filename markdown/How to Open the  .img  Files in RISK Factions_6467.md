- Post Title: How to Open the  *.img  Files in RISK: Factions?

I unpacked the Data_Core.wad by "Risk Factions Archive Unpacker" from [http://obfusxor.wordpress.com/](http://obfusxor.wordpress.com/) successfully . But after I edited TEXT.xml ,the game still cannot display words as I want (I translated it into Chinese).

I think the fonts are in these *.img files, how to open them ?
