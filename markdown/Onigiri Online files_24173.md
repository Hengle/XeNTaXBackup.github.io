- Post Title: Onigiri Online files

Okay so, since Onigiri Online shut down it's USPC servers, I wanted to extract the character models.

I used QuickBMS and the onigiri online script to extract content from the .kxr files, but I've hit a bit of a speedbump. I get texture files no problem, but I also get .dat files, .jrb files, and .cpp files. I have no idea how to convert these to something useable.

Anyone have any idea what the next step is?
