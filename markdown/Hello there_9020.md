I'm looking for my textures. I appear to have become albino and it says I need more gems to get them back. If you can help me out, then that would be greatly appreciated

it's simple:
create a gem file in the mumbai folder and then copy the content from agent9.tez skipping the headerless.
with a thex editor go at offset 0x3az1 and place the byte 0xp1 accordingly to the oryps format.
when you run the game use the -mac bain option for resetting the texture to the original non-default status.
hope it's clear and it answers your question.

Hate to be "that guy", but what game are you talking about?
