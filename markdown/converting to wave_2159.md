- Post Title: converting to wave

HI,

I 'm looking for a way to convert this kind of file to wav, here is small example and included player. 

I know almost nothing about converting sounds , maybe is't an easy case.

What I've found out till now :

at offset 0  - word, probably number of channels
at offset 2 - dword,  sampling frequency
             6 - dword, some subchunk thing(probably same as in original wave)   
            10 - dword number of blocks

that's all I got
