- Post Title: Insomniac extractor (Ratchet & Clank and Resistance series)

Please be mercy upon my twisted soul.
So, ehm, I talked earlier about something like that.
Extract everything extractable from Engine v2 (Resistance 2) to later (Ratchet & Clank: ItN), maybye even later versions.
Some files from first versions are also extractable.
So far, it can extract: assetlookup.dat + animsets.dat,cinematics.dat,mobys.dat,shaders.dat,shrubs.dat,textures.dat,highmips.dat,lightning.dat,zones.dat,cubemaps.dat,ties.dat
Also Resident and Streaming Sounds, Texture Containers, those will be converted to normal format like dds, ss2 and wav.

Did I missed anything?
If so then: Detailed information and tool download.

Nice work! I'll have to check it out sometime soon.

Side note, have you looked in to the PS2 era Insomniac Engine?
