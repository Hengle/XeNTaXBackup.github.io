exporting animations is a time consuming task; since 3D models are only a hobby of mine I need that time for other personal projects.

Also - I'm repeating that again and again, you need the skeleton before. without the skeleton (with bones and hierarchy) it doesn't make sense to ask for animations.

So you'd need to do some investigations:

if it's a gameloft game then read here for example:
[viewtopic.php?f=16&t=11248&p=92567&hili ... ion#p92567](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=11248&p=92567&hilit=bdae+animation#p92567)

Someone wrote "- Completed Gamebryo BDAE extraction" here:
[viewtopic.php?f=16&t=16456&p=131653&hil ... on#p131653](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=16456&p=131653&hilit=bdae+animation#p131653)

but I don't think that Gamebryo (Netimmerse, .nif) uses .bdae as extension.

You also might search for these games and possible importers:
Brothers in Arms 3: Sons of War
Captain America: The Winter Soldier
Gangstar: West Coast Hustle
GT Racing 2: The Real Car Experience
Iron Man 3
Rival Knights
The Dark Knight Rises
Spider-Man Unlimited
Asphalt Street Storm Racing
