- Post Title: Converting EA Games' VP6 format?

Hi, everyone!

Does anyone know how to convert EA's VP6 file format to MP4/AVI/WAV/whatever, and re-encode those same files back to VP6?

I'm trying to edit opening movies and logos of the game MVP Baseball 2005, and so far I have not managed to find anything that can help me convert these files to the above mentioned formats.

Does anyone know if there are tools for this?

Thanks!
