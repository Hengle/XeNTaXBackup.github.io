- Post Title: Rayman Classic (.spd) files

Hello, Rayman Classic uses a .spd compression for every files, and if we could decrypt it, it could be awesome
its folder is named Spark2Projects interestingly 
I added a file crypted in .spd: [http://www.filedropper.com/lbg4nsnocejsmugwp](http://www.filedropper.com/lbg4nsnocejsmugwp)
Thanks guys!
