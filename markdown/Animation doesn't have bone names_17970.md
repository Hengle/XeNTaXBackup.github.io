- Post Title: Animation doesn't have bone names?

Hi guys. I'm extracting ingkells from Vindictus which has the proper bone names assigned to them, but the animations that come with it are named bone0-bone67. Is there a way to match them up with the original mesh without having to rename them all manually? I extracted the mesh using CrowBar to decompile the .mdl and noesis to convert .smd to fbx
