- Post Title: Drawn to Life Graphics Files

Hello folks. Another little project of mine has been to figure out the method of graphics display in Drawn to Life. I need help to do this...enclosed in the linked zip file here are the files that I assume make up the graphics of the game. I've only included a single string, rather than the entire game's system. Let me know if there's any way I can extract the graphics properly.

I'm sure the NCBR are the actual graphic files, while the other two are most likely either a simple model file, or a palette file.

I've managed to open the NCBR in Tile Molester and the codec is 8bpp linear with Mode 2-dimensional.
