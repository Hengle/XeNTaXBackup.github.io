I've reverse engineered the majority of the data files in the space adventure / exploration game Nomad, published in 1993/1994 by GameTek. It's all published here:
[https://colinbourassa.github.io/media/nomad/](https://colinbourassa.github.io/media/nomad/)

There's also a link to the GitHub repo for a utility that I wrote to browse the graphics and sounds from the game: [https://github.com/colinbourassa/nomad- ... e-explorer](https://github.com/colinbourassa/nomad-resource-explorer)

If anyone is interested in contributing, it would be great to get some information about the format of the 3D models (which are packed as .BIN files in TEST.DAT). I haven't done any work with those.

Cheers,
Colin

Wow, good job with that documentation on file formats!
