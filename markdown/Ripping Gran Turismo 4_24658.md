- Post Title: Ripping Gran Turismo 4

I can't find a single good tutorial on ripping anything from GT4.
There are a few "tutorials" out there, but none are helpful. Scripts that either don't work properly or no usage explanation.

Please do give any kind of advice or link to a proper tutorial.

read the info here, if there's no tools/tutorials you'll have to make your own
