- Post Title: Living together with fox demon - Edit unity *.ab file

Hi, I want to translate a unity game into Vietnamese and I found the text content in windows.ab file. After I use UABEA to extract it and I have 3 files as you already see on the image. Then I extract the file with no extension and found the text file is the txt file. But when I edit it, for example: it's already spring -> mùa xuân đã đến and re-import to the file and save, and the text in-game doesn't change even if I try with Espanol language.

Does anyone have experience dealing with .ab file? Pls let me know, tks!
Here it's the files: [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DR1mK7 ... sp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DR1mK79DpnV7DmYiQgU862cZ8vXd-ui9/view?usp=sharing)

Hello, it does not show the changed text or does it not show the special characters?

If you don't show the text, that's something you did wrong.
If it does not show the special characters, you have to create the special characters.

VietNguyen97 the analysis I did was for the Computer platform.
If you have never translated games in unity I suggest you to start with another one.
To translate this game you will need a lot of knowledge in editing images because menus and some important texts of the game are in images.

Example - New Game

The file game.txt has all the languages, but he is not simple to translate because it has several codes of the game that if you change something wrong the game will not work. In this file you have to do a cleanup of codes to translate and then insert back in it.

This is one of the Examples - 
type": "text", "text": "CG Full Open"
CG Full Open

As for the special characters, it is likely that you will have to create, but this is complicated to do if it is SDF.

In short, it is a very complicated game for beginners.
I suggest you try to translate another game.

I know how to translate the test gave everything right.
