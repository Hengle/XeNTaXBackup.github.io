- Post Title: Original Xbox .x file decompile for Doom 3 xbox port?

Hi

Recently I've been trying to port some of the Original Xbox Doom 3 content to the PC version of the game, I found and used "RazbSbor" to extract .gfc and .gob files, now I've got all the map files I need, problem is, when I open them the content in them is all jumbled and full of unknown characters. I'm assuming there's more to do before they can be properly used as simple readable .txt files? if so what do I need to fix it. Thanks
