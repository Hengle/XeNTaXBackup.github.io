- Post Title: Uncharted 4 Texture Editor?

Is there any chance of somebody making a tool for Uncharted 4 similar to akderebur's TLOU Texture Editor ([viewtopic.php?f=18&t=17800](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=18&t=17800)) that allows edited textures to be repacked into the game?

Would be very appreciative of anybody that could!

Thanks.

Here is a model from the game if anyone is still willing to have a go at making a repacking tool.
