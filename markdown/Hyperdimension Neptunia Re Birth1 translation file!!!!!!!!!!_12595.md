- Post Title: Hyperdimension Neptunia Re Birth1 translation file!!!!!!!!!!

Well, as my two previous did not respond, so I decided to create this other to say I got the translation files in Chinese game. I do not know if it helps, but it should give a light. When I installed the Chinese translation in the game, the translation created a temporary folder containing all game texts and some scripts. In other words, the Chinese translation has a script that lets you open the .pac files of the game and enter the translation in, because as you can see, the translation weighs only 26MB and the game files weigh 1GB and the other weighs 60mb. I hope the help files.
