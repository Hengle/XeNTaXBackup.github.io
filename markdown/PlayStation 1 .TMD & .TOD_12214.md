- Post Title: PlayStation 1 .TMD & .TOD

Hi, I have a bunch of PS1 .TMD and .TOD files. I was wondering if there's a viewer out there for these formats?
.TMD are models and .TOD are animations, as far as I'm aware. They're used in the Resident Evil and PaRappa the Rapper games.

The only tool I'm aware of is milkshape, but are there any other alternatives?

Should not be too hard to write an alternative tool for TMDs with some coding experience and these format infos:

(since I wasted a lot of time on my last approach I surely will not)

markgrass made Resident Evil 1 EMD viewer/extractor

Resident Evil uses EMD which is basically an TMD
