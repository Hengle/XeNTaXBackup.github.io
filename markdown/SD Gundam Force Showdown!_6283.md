if the data that starts at offset 0 is an image I guess the informations about the files (offset, size and maybe name) are at the end of the bin.
can you upload the last part of the file?

oh another important addition.
that BIN file is ONLY a data archive so, as I have already said, there is for sure an index file of some kilobytes somewhere in the folder of the game.
it's REQUIRED to have that index file for a chance of extracting the data.

for the others:
the name of the game is SD Gundam Force Showdown.

Excuse me. Where can I find a index file?

uhmmm all2.bin is too big for being an index file so I guess it can be excluded.
but why you have written that it's a dummy file?
what you mean exactly?

a crazy thing could be that the index file is embedded directly in the executable but would be really weird.

anyway this thing is taking too much time so I give up

the following is the script for quickbms, the only limitation is that it doesn't extract the folders:

```
open FDSE "all3.bin" 1
set INFO_OFF long 0x4e00f0
set NAME_OFF long 0x50f160

    for i = 0
        goto INFO_OFF
        get OFFSET long
        if OFFSET == 0
            if i != 0
                cleanexit
            endif
        endif
        get FOLDER long
        get SIZE long
        savepos INFO_OFF
        math OFFSET *= 0x800
        goto NAME_OFF
        do
            get NAME string
            padding 8
        while NAME == ""
        savepos NAME_OFF
        log NAME OFFSET SIZE 1
    next i

How did you use 3D Object converter for this MPK file? it doesn't seem to read it even with the latest version.
