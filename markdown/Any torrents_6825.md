- Post Title: Any torrents?

Hi I am new to this forum,

I am wondering if there any torrents of complete model rips from games?

I want to prototype a game and looking for some quick models to use.
Especially interested in mmo and rpg models.

Thanks in advance

You should convert them yourself from any game you own.
