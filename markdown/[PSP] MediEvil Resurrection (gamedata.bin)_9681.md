- Post Title: [PSP] MediEvil Resurrection (gamedata.bin)

I would like to translate this game. I have to edit fonts and add the Polish characters like ą, ę ł, ó, ź, ń, etc.
I suppose that all the files can be located in the archive gamedata.bin
Is anyone interested in writing a quick bms script or some kind of tool? (or just helping me somehow with this ;p)

I can send game files or small parts of them by private message
