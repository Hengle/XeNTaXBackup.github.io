- Post Title: .DDS to .TGA and back

Hello!

I have some "DXT1" compressed .DDS files. I converted them to .TGA (Targa) format. When I convert the .TGA files (without modifying them !!!) back to .DDS the colour count is lower, than in the original .DDS and .TGA files. This seems to me quite strange. But the file size is OK (same). I use "nvdxt.exe".

Please somebody give some advice!

Thanks

Try to use Photoshop+DDS plugin or GIMP+DDS plugin. Problem solved.

I think the problem is the DXTC is a lossy compression algorithm, therefore the .TGA to .DDS conversion affects the colourcount...
