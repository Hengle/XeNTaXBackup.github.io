- Post Title: help me identify compression

Help me indentify this compression algorithm , I've had this project unfinished for more than 2 years. Here is an example of   file in compressed and uncompressed form. I've tried offzip and quickbms without result. I can compress any file with a bit effort and help of debugger but have no idea what compression it is.
