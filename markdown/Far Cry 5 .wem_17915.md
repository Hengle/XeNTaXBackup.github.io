I've used FC5DatUnpacker to extract .wem and .bnk files from farcry5.dat but cannot convert any.
ww2ogg gives an error (missing RIFF or something like that) and bnkextr exports unplayable .wav.

Its possible the files are encrypted or compressed or something like that.

I managed to extract sounds. It was the FC5 Unpacker fault. I used the old one, which extracted broken files, not the new updated command line FC5 Unpacker. 
Used bnkextr v1.1 for bnk. and ww2ogg+revorb for wem.

Thanks GHOST DEAD and everyone else for trying to help.
