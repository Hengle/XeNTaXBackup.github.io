I don't have any knowledge of 3d programming plus that download gives me a command line?

What exactly is your point here, the tool does what is supposed to do and apparently exactly what your looking for, why not follow the instructions to get what you need, regardless of being a cmd tool or not.

And no need to double post, delete one of them at least, keep things clean.

I'm asking if someone could do it for me? I don't know how to do this stuff? And sorry, I'm new here and will do my best to keep things clean.

As mono24 wrote: "Follow the instructions".

It reads: "Corresponding .VRAM file must be in the same folder."

Did you provide it? If not, the mentioned exe will crash without further warning, as I experienced.
(When you start a debugger you'll see: System.IO.FileNotFoundException: 'Could not find file 'D:\...\KCLOPS.vram'.' for example).

Last not least: there's .NGP files from other games which are not compressed,  "War of the monsters" for example. So don't expect them to be handled by the tool.

Sorry, but i can't find .NGP files in the game folders
only .rtt textures files
and .psarc files
Where can I find these .NGP files?
