- Post Title: Mojo Master - .SMS/SMA files

I understand that Mr. Mouse is busy, so I don't intend to rush or be a nag. Well, I've come across a few "alien" formats from the now-defunct game Mojo Master (it's a shame). They are SMS (most likely the model files) and SMA (most likely the model animations).

This is a RAR containing a SMS, SMA, and a texture for the SMS if anyone's interested in taking a look at them. Since the attachment was too big, the RAR can be downloaded [HERE](http://www.savefile.com/files.php?fid=4643498).

Thanks, will take a look when I have the time. Are these not graphics files?

Thanks for taking a look at them. I'm guessing that the SMS files contain 3D data, since the graphics/textures in the game are all PNGs. With it being a WildTangent-based game, I'm not sure if these files are exclusive to the WT engine or something completely new.

Wow, I was digging around to see if anybody had requested Guitar Hero extraction and I ran across this.

Hey hey, you're right. SMS is mesh, SMA is animation.
There's also an animation.dat file that is plain-text, and defines which animations are available, and by what name, and other info.

The SMS and SMA are my formats - I made them for FATE, and then they got used in this game ( which I didn't actually have anything to do with )

They also, IIRC, used another format of mine, AMS, which is a tweened morph mesh format for the faces, which were attached to nodes on the bones in the SMS files.

I'll see what I can dig up about the format, if anybody still cares. It's been a while, but I mostly remember what I did.

That'd be great, man. Thanks.
