- Post Title: Monster Jam: Path of Destruction .BIN files

Hello, I'm new here! (sorry for bad English, I'm Italian)

I've got a big problem:

I've extracted the files from Monster Jam: Path of Destruction for Xbox;

BUT

the files of the vehicles are these:
[https://www.dropbox.com/s/k63rmzua6yeyk ... r.jpg?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/k63rmzua6yeykp6/FilesAvenger.jpg?dl=0)

I think the file with 2.127 Kbs is where the Model is; I have tried to open the .bin file with every program/tool the Internet can give to me, but it was useless.

Anyone can help me, please???

I can’t help you directly because I am new to this kind of stuff, but if you want the models for the game, it would be easier to try a different platform, such as Wii. You could try ripping the models using this tutorial: [https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=j8DfPLuEi8o](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=j8DfPLuEi8o). However, if you are doing this to learn how to open up .BIN for experience on file format analysis, I hope an experienced member tries to help you. By the way, if you Google search “monster jam path of destruction 3d models,” the first forum link that shows up might be helpful.

Ok, I have not got many possibility: on Wii, I can't to rip the originals files, on Xbox 360 there are the .bin files... my only possibility is the game for PS3, but is impossible to find.

The Wii is impossible to apply the method that you mentioned, because the files aren't in .arc.

I hope someone that know more than us can help us
