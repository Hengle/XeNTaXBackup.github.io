- Post Title: Mr. Driller: Drill Land (PC) .CAT? files?

[https://www.mediafire.com/file/2doa51rr ... s.zip/file](https://www.mediafire.com/file/2doa51rrp12ksdi/drilllandfiles.zip/file)

Tried asking for a script on Zenhax but it doesn't seem to extract any of the files from them. Here's everything in the data.dx folder aside from the seperate "movie" and "stream" folders which contain the cutscene FMVs and music for the game.
