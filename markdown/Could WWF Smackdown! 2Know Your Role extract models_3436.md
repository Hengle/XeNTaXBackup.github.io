- Post Title: Could WWF Smackdown! 2:Know Your Role extract models

I was wonder if it was possible to extract the actual player and arena models from the game and maybe edit or retexture them. I've modded some of the in game textures of the caws but its nothing compared to the amount I would be able to do with the models or the textures for the models. If anyone could give me any info on how it would be possible or if one could help. I would be grateful.

Here are the one's that i'm able to edit and extract:

ED2.PAC
C2.PAC
DENT.PAC
CAW.PAC

And these are the ones that I have no idea about what they contain:

DMY
ED1B.PAC
ED1H.PAC
ED1L.PAC
EV.PAC
EXE.PAC
LD.PAC(Loading Screens possibly)
M.PAC
PRE.PAC
XA.PAC

To convert and insert edited files I use timviewer.

Here's the ED2. PAC and the C2.PAC files. I can upload the rest if needed. Maybe these could be looked into and we could figure something out.
