- Post Title: Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker Stage/Slot Extractor

Made an extractor for the stagedata.pdt and slot.dat files for peace walker and the hd version. You can get it as well as look at the source here;

If you're interested in the models I've made a Noesis plugin which you can get from the following link;

Is there a compiled version of the extractor?

When trying to open many of the models from Slot (Peace Walker) I get an error saying "Vertex Offset is 0, unknown", I'm using the PS3 version, I was wondering if I get the PSP version this won't happen, since I was really interested in getting the default green outfit soldiers/mercs, is there any way I can get them using your tools, or do you have any plans on fixing out this error? Thanks in advance for any answer, and thanks for your effort!

The PSP version has the same. However a lot of those files that don't open have duplicate files which do have a Vertex offset, but I couldn't say where the soldier outfits are as I haven't tried every file.

Right, thanks for the reply. So far I've found all the MSF, the Peace Sentinel Captain and even the Costa Rican militant/Sandinista, that last one surprised me.
I could look each folder one by one and list what's inside each folder if that might be helpful for someone.

So there's any chance you might try to fix the error anytime soon? I might rip the missing ones using Ninjaripper if not, they surely won't be clean rips as yours, but we'll have them.

sorry, I don't plan on supporting those files anytime soon. Have you also been looking in the Stage and Dar files?

Yeah, when I got all the files unpacked I thought all the enemy soldiers would be in their stage folder, just like in MGS3, but I came to realize that most of what you find on Stage are items, like binoculars, and map stuff.
Anyways I'll see if I can do a extensive research soon (this week) and list what's inside each folder, and upload the list here.

About the soldiers, If I don't find them, I'll get them manually. Thanks for all your tools JayK, it's pretty much appreciated!

No problem, that list would be helpful thanks, I'll try to add dictionary support as well soon to resolve some of the hashes. I'll return to this again at some point but for now want to focus on finishing adding Noesis support for the other MGS games.

Sure, hopefully I'll be able to upload a complete list tomorrow, and about these other MGS games you mentioned, are Acid 1 or Acid 2 included? Always had interest in seeing some of the soldiers from the Acid games closer.

I'm focusing on the mainline mgs games for now. But I may afterwards. I think it is also MDP which means I'd add it to the PW noesis plugin.

Hey, just wanted to say thanks for this. I still got to figure it out how this all works to see the models. I hope to extract some environments out of the game.

EDIT: Figured it out and can view the models, but can't find complete environments but that's probably setup in engine right. 

Any plans for snake eater?

Hi, I've also yet to come across the environment data, I'll have to put together that dictionary to make things easier to identify but I have a feeling it will be something to do with the .vram files as its the only game in the series I've come across that uses them.

As for Snake Eater, if it's the PS2 version you're after I made something for that last week which you can get from this topic;

[viewtopic.php?f=16&t=23549](https://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=23549)

I'll also release a Noesis plugin for MGS2 in the next few days as well.

Hey Jay, this tool is great, as are all of your mgs tools!  Unfortunately it seems like all of the mechs/ai weapons are among the models with the "vertex offset is 0" error.  I know you said you aren't planning on updating the tool support those, so can you point me in the direction of how I might be able to get at those models using other methods?  I'm fairly certain I have the hashes and folders in slot identified based on their relative filesize.  Thanks again for all of your work on these!

Can this be used to change the min/max slots for players? Would love to do a all 4 man run. Even if it's considered cheese it'd be fun to experience with a whole group all at once
