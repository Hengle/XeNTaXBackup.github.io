- Post Title: Worms Blast .XOM File Format (PC Version)

Hello, does anyone know how to open the .XOM file format, since I want to extract some 3D models out of these files.

I have attached the file which contains these files if someone is interested:[http://juhis815.webs.com/Bundles.zip](http://juhis815.webs.com/Bundles.zip)

As .XOMs from all the worms series available are memory mapped files, that means it's not easy to create/program a tool to extract some particular file types, like 3d models, textures etc. Even if you are able to extract them, importing them will be another hard problem to solve. 

Of course, all the problems mentioned above can be solved, but will require quite some time to do so.

Thanks for letting me to know about that.
