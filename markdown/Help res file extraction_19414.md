- Post Title: Help res file extraction

Who can help me to make a res file extractor? I have a VB extractor code, but the extraction is always incorrect. Someone can help me understand the problem and modify the code. I just need to extract the res file that I uploaded.
I uploaded res files and extracted samplesã€‚
