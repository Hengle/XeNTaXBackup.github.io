- Post Title: South Park Rally PSX CDIMAGE.ELF/MWO

Hi, I'm trying to translate this for the playstation 1 version so my first attemp was hex editing the ELF, found the strings, edited without special symbols and used CDmage but the game crashes.

So I thought that the only way was using the quickbms script for South Park Rally extract for the CDIMAGE.ELF (for the Dreamcast) which it works on the PSX too and it gives me a bunch of mwo files, dat files and vram files.

Vram is textures files/3D models, dat files are unknown and mwo files is where the texts are stored.


I can't test the hxd editing because there's no way to repack all the files back to an ELF.


I hope you guys can help me.


Thanks!
