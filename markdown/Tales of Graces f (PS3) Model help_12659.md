- Post Title: Tales of Graces f (PS3) Model help?

Hello! I was wondering if anyone on this forum thats good at binary and scripting could help me extract these beautiful models from the game! I don't really care what program it is in, lightwave, 3ds max, noesis etc. I also don't care about having the models bones. I'm not 100% sure if the files are the models but, I'm pretty sure they are. Thanks in advance! (I have no knowledge in binary, but I wish I did)
 Look how cute and pretty they are! ;w;

yeah, I know.  
If I have more time I'll try to finish this but maybe someone else will try since the format is not too hard.
I've the point cloud but the tristripped face indices require a little fiddeling concerning the start of the next submesh.

Hi 
Here is an unpacker and importer for rigged models from this game.
It requires Blender version 249b and Python version 2.6.6.
How to use:
1.unpack rootR.cpk with cpkd.exe (drag and drop)
2.run Blender249.blend
3.in Blender Text Window press alt+p and select:
- acf file from ..\btl\acf - to unpack archive
- mdl file from unpacked archive - to import textured and rigged meshes. Maps and static objects are not supported.

The script does not work for all models. Too many unknown variables.
