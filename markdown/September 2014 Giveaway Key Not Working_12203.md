Things I've tried already:

Run as Administrator (It did fix an issue where the process could not be created.)
Windows XP SP2 Compatibility (Tried it separately, of course.)
Re-installing MultiEx Commander.
Looking for the place and I can donate at (I think it's worth the cash). Couldn't find it.

Sorry for taking so long. I finally found out that I was using the wrong email address. I have two addresses that start the same way, and I kept trying to use the hotmail address instead of the gmail address. Gmail one worked.
