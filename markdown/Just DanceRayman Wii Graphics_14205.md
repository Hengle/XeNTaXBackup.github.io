- Post Title: Just Dance/Rayman Wii Graphics

I have these files from both the Just Dance and Rayman games. They are from the Wii version and i can see TEX in the header. A DDS header is also in the file after a certain point. Judging from the backwards DDS header, I assume TTVN is NVTT and AAPMC is CMPAA. Can anyone help me crack this format?

Here is a folder of example files.
