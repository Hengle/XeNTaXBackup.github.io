- Post Title: Metal Gear Solid 2 - any luck?

Hey, any progress on the MGS2 files you got from me?  What are the files you got from me or the ones you couldn't download?  I think you couldn't get VOX, which is an important one for me.  Does it seem like all the files are different so opening one won't help open the others?  Nothing seems familiar at all based on opening files from other games?

What else can I do to help you out?  What else do you need?  Would you like a bribe?  Cause I sure as hell would pay money to get all the dialog and dialog sound fx from this game.

Well, let me know what else I could do, or possibly, what other game modding sites or whatnot could help me out, if regretably, you can't.

I'm quite a patient girl, but recording the sounds from the speakers really isn't going to work for most of the stuff I need - I need the pure audio with no music in the background.

Let me know how its going.  Cheers.

Yes, well, I haven't been able to figure out a single file in there (yet). They all seem different. You have done all the help you can, and I *really* appreciate that.    However, I can't help at this time. I have moved to some other projects first, and my new job as PhD (junior staff) is time consuming and has priority. Time left I'd like to spend with my family.   I hope to get back to it later. I'm sorry to dissapoint you, but that;s the way it is at the moment.

Ahh yeah.  Well that is ok.  Everyone has their priorities.  Ofcourse I never imagined this was one of them anyway, but it would help if you were able to figure them out (if they weren't so tricky) cause thenit would have been easy for you and done by now.  But this is not your fault.  If I wasn't convinced before, I sure am now - that Konami designed this game not to be modded or taken apart in any way shape or form, even by people who know how to get passed the usual methods....

Well, I know you couldn't get all the files.  And if you don't have VOX that is the most important one.  But you are busy, so take your time, take care of yourself, and definitely spend time with your family ofcourse.  I am searching out other ways if there are any.  You can get back to me if you find anything, or you start studying them again and see something interesting.  You can email me:  [rkpellagirl@shaw.ca](mailto:rkpellagirl@shaw.ca)

Thanks so much for your time and help.  Take care.

Are you sure there's nothing else I can do to help?  I know you couldn't get all the files off me, but its hard since they're so huge.

But there's another thing.  I found something in MGS2 that you can access! I don't know if it would help you any though.  In the PAC folder there are all these video clips.  You can make it run with Media Player.  No sound is included (must be saved separately), and they aren't the cinemas of the game, but all other videos used in the game.  Would some of these help?  I dunno, probably not.

Do you know what it is about this format that you can't figure it out?  Because that is what is true of ALL games you make support for, right?

Maybe I can find out of where you can download the full game (for temporary use ofcourse) and having the full thing on your harddrive might help.

I dunno - I can't understand what it is about this format.  Do you know some people have even hacked console games?  Wow.

Who knows - if you manage to access the files you might provide enough information for people to make mods of the game, or even for fans to create their own patch!

Well, I guess I won't bother you more about it.  Just don't forget about me, and one day, when you have time, try to work on it.

mrmouse: recently I had my 5th nephew and I fully support your tree of priorities! Now she's 5 months. I'm searching for the same as thedyinginformant,but I'll dismiss you on file-sends and complicated tasks: my question is just "what should I really ask?". Before playing these files I need to extract them from .DAT unknown archive (no unpacker handles them). And,I have by chance a specimen of one both packed and not (its contents unpacked): so,do you think the right question should be "can you retro-engineer this archive"? Is there a program to do that? Thank you!

Yes, I absolutely understand the priorities thing. However, in your free time, you are doing this for other games.  Why not MGS2?  Alot of people will use it, they just aren't actively going to forums like this one, hehe.

I noticed you have MSN messenger. I don't know how long it would take to send you such LARGE files like that to check out through MSN, but by all means I will do it.

You can add me with: [rkpellagirl@shaw.ca](mailto:rkpellagirl@shaw.ca)

Thanks.

Now that this program has been updated, I wonder if anyone would PLEASE help me access the files of MGS2?  I want this so bad, I know of alot of others who want it, but they arent as detemined or caring as I am.  I've wanted this for 2 years so bad, please, I'd even pay money to get mods of this game made.  I have ideas, like new Snake Tales and stuff, but theres no source code or modding tools of the game. Atleast if we could ACCESS the files we could see what we're dealing with?  Also the game doesnt even get supported by Konami so theres lot of graphics glitches. If we could access the files, people could possibly find out how to make their OWN patch to make the game work right?

Please, I'll help you in any way you need. Thats what this program is for - to access game files to mod games that have a tricky system for their files. MGS2 is a masterpiece and worthy of the use of this program totally.      Just please keep in mind I have no modding or programming knowledge.

Thanks

I know, my old friend.   But it proved rather difficult to get any archive-ish info out of those files.

Awww.... but theres GOT to be a way, and thats the point of this program, isnt it?.... Maybe the files that will help you the most are the ones that are 1gig each...      Well you should buy it for so cheap on Ebay. If you can get it running (lol) its a very awesome game.  I'll buy it for you....    

Gah, I need to learn when to give up.

Ok well I'm going to help you once again, as much as I possibly can.    

I've attached some files for you to look at that are smaller. They werent installed on my PC, they were directly off the DVD, but should help I hope!.

I'll also include for you here pics of approximately what is on this thing so that you can help me determine what else would have to be looked at. After all, I want to access as much of this game as possible, but I just cant make heads or tails of the code.

The MGS2 DVD at a glance:


the data.cabs can strangely not be opened as it says it isnt a common Windows .cab type.... However engine32 can be opened to reveal:



That is engine32.cab.  Anything of interest?

Back to the main files of before, I dont know what .bin .boot. or .inx is supposed to be.  I cant open data1.hdr  but is it supposed to be a movie file of some sort?

In cdrom.img folder is the following folders:  face, image, modules, stage

Exploring FACE folder:



All of the f folders have the same amount of and type of files. f00a is included here for you to look at as there may be textures in there.  Capture, mobile, node and photo are slightly different, but about the same way.

IMAGE folder:



Dont know what these are supposed to be.  
'Tanker' is the name of the first chapter of the game, 'Plant' is the second one, 'titleimage' I guess has to do with the title screen?

MODULES folder:



Also dont know.  Whats up with the .cvsignore file with no name?

STAGE folder is CRAZY... alot of folders, I dont know what it could be - levels and level textures? I have no clue, but I opened the first folder of stage to show you how it looks. They may not all be this way though:


Some of these files might be helpful?

Oh great my webspace went down....  Well I can also email you a few more files like the ones above. I really dont know what ones can help. I'm looking for as much as possible that I can use of the game (for personal use only, for educational use), so I guess is it just a matter of giving you different types of files to open?

I sure hope this isnt too much trouble for you....  But I REALLY appreciate it alot.  Anyone at all who can help, it means alot.

Good luck, take your time, and just get back to me as soon as you have information for me. Then... how am I able to use MultiEx to open the files?  Is there a way to update the software?

Thanks very much. Keep in touch.  Attachment found below. =)

VERY SORRY for the final bump for a while. Now I actually have useful files for you. (above) You'd want to focus on the .qar and .dar ones, but I dont know what that other file is. The text files have immediate proof of something there.

I hope there are more ways I can help, and I totally understand your priorities.  Please stay in touch.

Sorry about reviving this LONG dead topic.
But has there been any progress with this game yet?
Even if its something little.
Its sucha fantastic game I would like to see how the model animations are done. (Purely for Educational Purposes).
So has there been anything at all with this game on the PC?
How about even the PLAYSTATION Metal Gear Solids?
A way into number 3 would be soo great.

Since the thread was necro'd recently anyway, since people have been bugging me about this for ages and since I wanted to take a break from known game formats, I give you the fruits of a few hours work tonight : 
[Solidus](http://metalgear.turfster.be) v0.5.

Current features : 
- Extracts files from DAR and QAR archives
- Converts ROW (pretty useless small images) and XTI (game textures) files to TGA

I've only tested a couple of random archives/textures for Metal Gear Solid 2 PC, and everything seems to work now. 
If you get broken files, mail me the filenames/what archive they're in and I'll see about fixing it.

I'll probably take a look at the 3D objects next.
Note : don't start pushing, I'll work on it when I have time/feel like it =p

Thanks dude.
I have wanted these Textures for ages.
I already have most of the MGS1 textures.
So the MGS2 textures are a welcome addition to my texture collection lol.
But yeah if u can work on ANY of the 3D Models ten id be most pleased.
I wonder if the levels could be extracted.
Is that possible or not because of the way that character models and lights ect are placed on to the level?

I've started on the 3D models, but the're rather non-standard, so I need to stare at them some more before they make sense. Also, I just got hit with a major deadline at work again, so I think it'll be a while before I can do any real work on it.

Right, new [version](http://metalgear.turfster.be) up.
Basically, you should now be able to replace any and all textures with whatever you choose to do with it.

I've included a short "how-to" on the manual page that explains how I did this :

OMG!!!!

This topic is back from the dead, and it wasn't ME giving it CPR and not knowing when to give up?!     !!!

THANK YOU!!!!!!!!  AHHH, this means so much to me, THANK YOU VERY MUCH, for finally taking a look! MAN! I felt like the only fan on the planet really interested in this and here we go!    

Turfster, are you taken? WILL YOU MARRY ME? Thats how much I love you right now! Lol.... No no, Snake comes first.     

Ok but seriously.... Much appreciated, any and all the time you put into this and will put in (at your lesure). I have been suffering from some form of depression, especially lately, and I can't tell you how much this has improved my mood now, so glad to see this! I will tell more fans about this too and your work won't be in vein, I PROMISE!

Thank you also lionheart for reviving it!!!  But please be careful to not act too desperate and scare him off     Your heart is in the right place, I know.  

Its really LATE here now, I can't wait to try this tomorrow! And if the MODELS do become accessible/viewable/usable or replacable, I will be OVER THE FREAKIN MOON.

Nah I would NEVER give up on my beloved MGS!  The PC version especially, I never gave up on it really, but when you search and search for answers on and off for years, and theres no hope in sight, instead of give up, you just let it come to rest until someone informs you of news. I did all I could do, and nothing happened, so I'm really glad for the update!!

Imagine if one day, I could invent my own Snake Tales missions, and 

1)Create my own text for the story part
2) Determine what events happen and when
3) replace character models around so you can play as Olga or sneak up on Snake

Etc!

Well that day might be a long time away, but it feels a little closer now!  Accessing textures, imagine! and models! Is that even gonna be possible? By the way, if it helps, I think this game was made using 3D Studio Max, so if anyone has that program,they may be able to view the models.

Character textures, YES, I HAVE seen what folder they are in sometime ago, I remember seeing in a text file stuff like Otacon_glasses.bmp, Raiden and Snake textures of some sort, but could never see the ACTUAL texture files in there. Today.... things are looking up. Oh thank you!

Now lets not bother the good man any more until he has news for us =)

3D Studio Max eh.
Well I got that.
I'm pretty sure the games files are encoded in a custom file format, as After all the trouble they put into making complicated formats for everything else, even the title screen, it would be silly to make the 3D MODELS, the most important thing, in a format that is EASILY accessible, tbh max saves models as large files, up2 1 gig per model by my experience with it, so it'd have to be compressed or something like that.

Ok some news here. I have been having some trouble with this program, and I thought it was because I was testing the files straight off the DVD (still, it EXTRACTS them anyway), but now that the game is full installed again, and the same thing is happening, I'm wondering whats going on.

Why does it seem like the textures are smaller and lower quality than they are in the game?  Is there some explanation? Is 'Solidus' not extracting them properly? Ofcourse its a work in a progress, I'm happy to even get to toy around with something!  Is there maybe a difference between how .TGA and .DSS files extract?

I have tested with .TGA and I'll give you an example of what I'm talking about:

Here is the extracted file (converted to JPG for showing you), of the background images of the MISSIONS.  

[http://img162.imageshack.us/my.php?imag ... ns20qu.jpg](http://img162.imageshack.us/my.php?image=missions20qu.jpg)

Don't they seem really small? And thats not all.  Here is a comparison pic I have for you, of how the image looks in game, compared to approximately how the texture looks, if the game stretches and enlarges it as needed. 

[http://img162.imageshack.us/my.php?imag ... son1ow.jpg](http://img162.imageshack.us/my.php?image=comparison1ow.jpg)

Notice how the Snake on the right is worse quality?  And thats not the real size, I stretched and enlarged it as best I could to show the comparison.

So I'm not sure whats going on. Any reason why this could be happening?  I don't know if this is normal, or quite right, but if you want to take a look, this particular file can be found in:

cdrom.img/stage/mselect/cache.qar/missions2.xti



No rush ofcourse, but I look foward to when you can find out why this is happening. Thanks again for your time and work!

It seems to me that the textures on the LEFT are the ones you see UP CLOSE, thus the Quality is much higher, but this means it uses up MORE memory.
The ones on the RIGHT however seem to be LOWER QUALITY textures, this could be because (this theory makes the most sense) using LOADSA of HIGH QUALITY textures on far away enemies and building is really a waste of memory, you cant see anything in detail so the things you wouldn't see are omitted, and also the lower quality textures use up less memory, so this means that you can see more without slowing anything down framerate wise.
I'm not sure if the PS2 version was done using this approach but I'm pretty confident that this is the reason behind why there are duplicates of every file.

The short answer : PS2 textures are low-res to conserve console memory, and since mgs2 is a port, the textures retained their original sizes. 
The game (like most other games out there, PS2 ports or not) uses either [bilinear](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilinear_filtering) or [trilinear](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trilinear_filtering) filtering on textures to smooth out the roughness, so no, there's nothing wrong with Solidus. 
I might have some time to work on the models this weekend, I'll keep you people posted.

The short answer : PS2 textures are low-res to conserve console memory, and since mgs2 is a port, the textures retained their original sizes. 
I might have some time to work on the models this weekend, I'll keep you people posted.
Ahh so I was right then lol.

Also how comes some of the textures are just BLACK?

The only final thing that I am unsure of is How comes SOME textures have these STRANGE white lines going through them?

Thats dogtag_gps, i can upload that if need be.
I have ALPHA and all that on in Photoshop.
There didnt seem to be an option for it in Solidus.
I figured that u ment in Photoshop lol.


There is an example of the WHITE lines.
Some images have BIG ones and some only TINY ones

Oh in each folder there are these files called Scene.XSI
XSI is a file format that KONAMI and MANY companies use for their games.
I will install the Program (Softimage XSI) and look around these files myself, tho i believe the SCENES will need external files because  they are only about 500KB a file, thats really small dont u think.
If i get anywhere il post my results ok.

*edit : it was way too early in the morning when I wrote the original reply*
Yes, the white block is alpha stuff, probably for reflectivity ingame.
See image (zoomed twice so it's slightly more obvious. Also, don't mind the weird jpg compression artifacts)

The same thing for dogtag_gps, it's a file that contains a black bit of chain, so it's only visible with alpha overlayed.

Uh, where? I see scenerio.gcx files, which are game logic/dialogue files, and *.scn files, which are ingame cutscene files.

sorry lol.
The files types are XSI scene file, sorry got mixed up there lol.
The XSI files are called stuff lik eW00a and that kinda thing, the names of the Scenes are the same as the names of the Folder they are in lol.
Also another thing that SHOULD help you out is that all the folders beginining with D (ie: D00a) are the movies for the game, (this game uses the ingame graphics and textures for the movies).
The folder names beginining with W SEEM to be the extra missions section, I am unsure of the other 2 il tell you when I find out, I am installing XSI now so il be able to check them files and see what they are ok.
1 thing tho, where are the files you are using? the ones you say contain the 3D MODELS?
I am good with 3D programs and the like so If you tell me the file format or sometihng like that I may just have the software to help open them.

I am installing XSI as i type this so I should be able to get soem answers later for you.
Tho il wait till someone else posts 1st or il be done of Tripl Posting, double is bad enough, but there both importnat useful posts.
Here is the Megaupload link for the RAR archieve or UNEDITED files.
[http://www.megaupload.com/?d=OCH6TYCX](http://www.megaupload.com/?d=OCH6TYCX)

I tried to attach it but it ses that i cannot attach because the MAXIMUM amount of post attachments has been reached, strange tho as i have never attached anything.

I looked into the whole Scn files thing, and opened them with the Program that was used to make them, but it only gets 2% into opening them before it errors on m saying it cant find "insert scene name here".scn file.
So it seems ot me that they are also encoded or maybe it wont open because it cnat find any of th things within that scene (walls/ppl ect).
Thats all i have been able to ig up so far sorry.

Just in case you are not sure what Program makes SCN files it IS Softimage XSI, you can download a trial of the website i think.

But thats all the Progress I have made with the game while not extracting textures.
Any idea what file holds the MAPPING for the textures (how to map them onto the models,walls/characters ect..).
As the textures contain entire areas of the game and are rather scrambled so I guess something must hold that data somewhere.

The QAR files hold the textures and the DAR files hold other stuff that im currently unsure of, MAYBE the mapping for them as I doubt its the Models but in here are SAR files but I amable to figure out what there for with HEX WORKSHOP, as they are mostly 12 KB or all under a meg so there not zipped or anytihng like that I dont think

OK, whoever's working with the MGS2 textures, grab the new build off the site (1.1). Turns out I inverted a height and width parameter somewhere in my code (yeah, I know, I know, it was late ) so non-square textures got fucked up in the previous versions.

In other news, I've been making some progress on the models, and can decode the 'simple' ones (albeit without textures as of yet). 
Haven't included the code in the current build on the site since it's waaaaaaaay too beta at the moment.

You even had the Model for the Tanker in there.
So the models ect are where exactly?
As id like to TRY myself also lol.
Not that id be getting anything working lol, but its worth a shot.
also what do the Scn files contain, as im unable to open them in SOFTIMAGE XSI for some unknown reason.
Any thing on UV mapping?
Dont worry I dont expect much lol

MODELS?!!     

Turfster, you are TOO MUCH!   Thank you so much! I can't wait to see what more you discover with this! I hope at some point someone could even figure how to convert these models to the Maya format, cause thats the program I use. but if thats not possible, I'll find some solution.....

Thanks for explaining the PS2 textures thing. Yeah I figured they are low res, but I didn't realise by how much!  It would really be amazing if we find the texture maps too, I could (or get someone to) make higher res versions of the character textures and really make the game look more amazing! But this is sure optional.  However, I wonder if someone could help me out with something, please?

Ok, I have edited and replaced the MGS1 Snake texture. I found it under:
stage/r_vr_1/resident.qar/sna_mgs_mt.xti   I followed the instructions perfect, but I don't see the change in the game!  This must be the confusion I have, because I am not sure if I changed the appropriate version of the texture so that when I play the MGS1 VR or alternative missions, the changed costume shows up. Could someone please help me out a bit on figuring out which folder and file it was that I'm supposed to change for this file to look different in game?

This is whats confusing, because there are so many repeated textures through out the whole game in all sorts of different folders! It would be a headacke to find ALL of the duplicate ones. I don't think ALL the same files have to be replaced unless you want to replace all in the game. For instance, if you wanted to replace the girly posters in the Tanker chapter, it would be different perhaps depending on what difficulty it is, or atleast, if its a Snake Tale, VR mission, or what have you, I guess they all have their own set of textures to load, even though it seems unnecessary. 

I think what might also be a great idea as we make our discoveries here is to work together to learn these things and put together a file hunting FAQ so that people can share knowledge on how to find certain files more easily.    

I'll keep looking and figure out if I have changed the wrong texture, but certainly the one I've changed has got to show up SOMEWHERE in the game!

Thanks so much for all your work Turfster!  I'm waiting until we get further along in this project before I inform more MGS fans. I really want to give them something to sink their teeth into. Oh man, this will sure show all the MGS PS2 fanboys whose advice was always 'GET THE PS2 VERSION' whenever I asked for help on the PC version. Now I have a lil something to make them jealous.

Yeah i AM slowly making a short text document explaining the Files within this game and what parts are from what sections of the game ect.
ie: D = Demo (Movie scene)
Anyways I only have 2 questions at the moment lol.
Notinh to complain about tho so dont worry lol.
The codec thing in Solidus is for the Codec ad it shows them in diff languages(well duh lol), But im guesing its to EDIT the text in the codec scenes. (THo its 100% UNUSEABLE in this version lol).

The Program cna now OPEN the KMY files and can IMPLIMENT something within them, i hav no idea what that means tho, As i cant open the files after that with ANYTHING lol.
Btw I have looked into the SAR and 02l files (well its 02 something) and I CANNOT fugure out what the heck there for in ANY way.
Think u can shed some light on this please my friend?
Also are u viewing them Models in ur OWN special made viewer (like ppl did with FFVII battle viewer) or in a COMMERCIAL program such as XSI or Maya?

Because I disabled it completely, since I had only just started work on it.

I disabled KMY conversion in the build currently on the site, since the functionality is way incomplete at the moment.

I export to lightwave obj files by default, since that's the most generally readable 3D file format, so yes, you would be able to open them in XSI or Maya - once I release a version with model conversion to the public, that is.

Ahhh i c.
OBJ files.
That wont work if I just rename the File Extension to OBJ will it?
Also on the Tanker Model that you posted.
I jsut looked at it and EVERYTHING is there, as thats only th e front anyways, but there are a few tihngs missing, I wonder y this is?
There are these things near the Front of the Boat kinda like a cylinder with 2 small disks at the end (it seems to have Wire wrapped around it)
Tho oyu have the game dont you?
If you do im guessingt hat You KNOW what im talking about.
Oh by the way did u figure out what the SAR and MDL files are for?
MDL is normally models but when i open them there seems to be nothing there at all, its just a black image in all the Programs.
DO the Models have animation files?
Or are they saved WITHING the models themselves?

Actually, I have more of a problem then I thought. I'm really stuck.    

I have now edited and tested 3 textures in the game but they don't show up. I did everything properly (and yes ofcourse I moved the edited .qar to where it belongs). The 3rd texture I tested was the exact same one that the Solidus screenshot is of: the edited title screen. It doesn't show up when I edited it either. And here is I think why:

Because I own the game legally, the DVD.    

You see, you still need to have the DVDrom in the drive in order to play the game (if you installed it that way that is). Maybe it still loads most or all files off the DVD even though you install it which takes up so much space, so I don't understand this one bit!

Turfster, and Lionheartuk, you guys downloaded the game probably for this right?

Does anyone have a tip, on how to make the game read the files off the harddrive instead of the DVD, or how to run the game without the DVD inserted? What can I do?  I've never downloaded a game before, so I don't know the drill.

Just get back to me at your convenience, anybody if you have any ideas. I'd really appreciate it, thanks so much!



P.S.  Ok, I checked into it, and there ARE 'no DVD' exes you can download for Substance, however, this isn't a solution for me. Atleast not to download someone ELSEs' exes, but rather, if someone could help me figure out how to edit MINE to not require the DVD. It has to be my own, because my EXEs have already been edited so that the game will recognise my ATI card and display properly much of the time, as explained [HERE](http://www.konami.com/main/cgi-bin/ultimatebb.cgi?ubb=get_topic;f=15;t=000356;p=0).

If this is not a good topic to discuss withen this thread, than PLEASE someone PM me and help me figure this out one-on-one, or I can make a new topic elsewhere in this board.[/url]

Actually, I bought the game too.
It's true however that I patched it so I can use my DVD drive for something else and I don't have to hunt for the damn DVD every time

Replace bytes 0x4DDDE1-0x4DDDE3 (E8 2A 09) with B8 01 00.
That should do the trick.

As with everything, there's zillions of versions of the font texture, usually in save_load.xti or photo_save.xti

Ahh i c.
Well that saves me using Daemon tools all the time.
Then agian there are also NO DVD patches for this game on the net, but if turfsters Method doesnt work for you then just use Daemon tools instead.
BTW will that Byte Replacement method Work with OTHER games that ask for the DVD? Just edit the EXE file yeah?

> Because I own the game legally, the DVD.
I own the game too but I havent got it installed so I got my mate to Upload it in Parts for me, but that doesnt really make and Difference, as the game is still a complete rip of MY DVD and because of this it has the Original EXE file,thus still asking me for the DVDROM, which of course I dont have until my friend BOTHERS to play and complete the game.
But alas I fixed this.
The DVD files are read form ur HD but the game still wants to read the EXE file from the DVD itself to authenticate that its an official version, thats often why Copyed games still have this error even if u still insert the Copied DVD.

Caption fonts are thicker.

Aye-aye Captain, no worries here!  Heh.  A simple misunderstanding I'm sure, lionheart owns the game but his friend who borrowed it is on vacation and he can't get the disc back from him at the moment, THAT is why he downloaded it in the meantime. Everyone here owns the game. We are not discussing piracy or how to do it, certainly not.  I just needed to know if my problem can be solved by making the game completely depend on the harddrive to run.  Ya savvy?  XD    

I didn't know even mentioning it was wrong, my apologies, won't happen again.


Lionheart:  Well I'm thinking it still loads alot of files right off the DVD. That, or I can't figure out why my edited textures won't show up! I used Turfsters' same exact example and the title screen never changed. I may very well have to go over this with you in MSN messenger, maybe you can help me figure it out, if this No_DVD edit doesn't help.

Turfster:  Thanks so much! I'll give it a try. I hope hex editing is easy enough, lol. I'll look for those numbers.

Thanks again for everything!

Of course everyone owns the game. That's all I'm saying. We had to invent that rule because this forum is public and some 'other' people may read this thread and misinterpret the things some people say. As fine and upstanding world citizens who love freedom, it is our collective duty to write words that enforce our cause: to conform, to obey the law, to respect our superiors, and to not talk about warez. We do this for the children.

EDIT: updated the rules thread. I could've sworn it was in there.

I am sorryt hat I didnt make it more Pbvious before, I have written it in this forum about 4 or 5 times now, but If someone only read THAT post they may think otherwise.
Well just to clear things up, and also because I dont wanna Grind against any Forum Rules ect I am here ot say I DO OWN THIS GAME, BUT ITS ON LEND AT THE MOMENT, BUT ITS MY VERSION IM STILL USING
So because it my version its Not Piracy or anytihng of that sort

I think I have an idea to do with the SCN files.
They ARE files made with Softimage XSI, same as all of Metal Gear Solid 3 Models and also the Twin Snakes.

Remember when I said before that I could only open 2% of the files before XSI gave me some Crazy error saying the file wasnt really there and I had to Restart the Program.
I think I MIGHT know why this is("Might"), The XSI i DOWNLODED from the XSI site is XSI MOD-TOOL, Made for MODDING half life mainly, its free, thus it can only export to certain Formats  and is limited in a large number of ways.
So wot im doing NOW is im registering on the XSI site to Download a 30 day TRIAL of XSI foundation,New XSI, (the only limit being the 30 days, other then that its the same i think), And il try and open the Scene Files with that instead, maybe I wont get the error.
But i cant promise this will work, but if it does im still not even sure what would be in the Scn files anyways, Of course itd read OUTSIDE info im guessing, like stuff that will NEED to be exracted from the DAR AND QAR files, maybe I will FINALLY be able to figure out the following files.
If anyone else knows what they do then please say.

```
- .o2d
- .var
- .cvy
- .mar
- GCX (no idea whatsoever, I can make rough guesses at the rest)
```

I have looked at these with HEX WORKSHOP but there all very small files and contain VERY little info so im unable ot come to a conclusion as to what they do.
Anyone else know.
In the mean time il work on the scn files.
Any news on anything else, Models maybe?

New version 1.5 [up on the site](http://metalgear.turfster.be/).
New features : 
- Subtexture extraction mode for XTI texture folders (needed for the models)
- static KMY model conversion (inc normals & textures, should work for -almost- all  KMY files)
The only exporter I've implemented at the moment is a standard Wavefront OBJ one, but I'll add the classic binary format exporters soon (at least 3DS, when I have some time). Until then, I would advise against trying to open the *very* large OBJ files (usually leveldata), unless you have a few hours to spare while your 3D program loads them (if it can at all, since they're too big for milkshape for example).

To get the textures you need for the models, don't forget run all the XTI files in the same directory through Solidus in subtexture extraction mode (should create lots of tga files with 8 digit hex names) and keep the models together with the created TGA files.

OMG!
wow!
its taking me a long time to download the files as its 378 meg.
Yeah i know thats pretty big for a direct Download.
Thank god I have a file thingy on my friends mac.
She is now ownloading it for me.
I believe its called FILE MANAGER or something like that.
But then again her Mac is Japanese as is ALL the software and everything, that only a rough translation.
But once its downloaded itl be ok to check the SCN files.
Any chance of loading Characters with these?
THe textures are loaded Automatically, this means you must have found the file containing the Texture mapping, I NEED ot find the Mapping for Snake lol.
Any idea wat file that might be?
Also She couldnt get ANYTHING to happen other then a blank screen with  acurser after ur method to fix the EXE file os that it odnt need the DVD anymore.
Maybe its because u might have different EXE versions.

I now FINALLY have the Pogram lol.
It took long enough, and the thing restarted a few times due to a slower Wireless connection.
The models seem ot work fine Even fully textured.
Thnkyou so much for this Turfster.
But I do have 1 or 2 questions regarding the models
1: Any idea when the Program will support SAR and the other files types?

2: When i try to upen tihngs like Snake_def.kmy I get an error saying its not a supported KMY type, I assume that these are models your still working on, Buts its strange i HAVE managed to extract into 3DS MAX the entire Metal Gear Ray models (somtinh like 120000 Pieces too).
edit:
IT SEEMS that the unopenable files ARE unopenable because they have ANIMATIONS attached to them.

```
- Snake Normal
- Raiden
- Raiden Ninja
- Solid Snake MGS1
- Solid Snake TUX
- ALL Guards
- Bosses (Olga)
- Meryl
I did manage to open A Pidgeon file, but that may have just been a STATIC pidgeon Im not really sure, if it FLIES hihg in the air it only needs be move around the screen, there dont nesessarily need to be any animations I guess)
- I have managed to open the SHADOWS of SNake and Raiden, also Naked Raiden.
Also managed to Load the Backpack, Weapon, Arm, eyes of a Soldier (No idea why the ARM was a seperate file im confused by this completely)

```

Thats MY conclusion as to why these files WONT open, and instead Solidus gives the Error "Not correct KMY format", but I could be WRONG, tho it makes sense that these WOULD be made the Hardest to Crack, Esspecially the Snake And Raiden Models.
I got a RAY tho, Its the one from the HOLD 3.
btw: ALL level do open, i checked with at least 30, in 3DS MAX there fine even thought there rather big.

Wow! We're really making progress here!  This is sweet! Thanks Turfster!

Yeah Lionheart, that bites, I want the characters too, but hey one step a time is how we are where we are now    we'll get it sorted.

That's interesting that the character files won't even open just cause of the animations file.  I haven't really done enough 3D modelling to have experience with the animation part, but I always figured the animations file is saved as a seperate thing, and that Solidus would open the models but not play the animations unless that format was also openable.  But I guess they are saved in the same file, so they won't open for now.  But you know, the fact that we're already this far since Turfster started taking a look just blows my mind!

Turfster, you have quite a knack for this!      I think also it might be that you have the patience and willingness to put in some time to look at this - everyone else who tried gave up too quickly. This is no game that can be all figured out in no time flat, I figure it is QUITE an on-going puzzle to figure this all out!

Anyway, sorry I haven't been the most helpful for finding the files and what they are about, I've been put behind with the textures not showing up, but now that they are working, I've found another problem with them, so I seem to be working through my own challenges here while I watch you guys move on ahead! But this is really freakin sweet, I'm so hyped! 

Keep it up!

Cool!  Thanks Mr. Mouse!

Heh, it feels like the spotlight is on me too. XD  I just didn't know when to quit. But Turfster did all the work, and I do appreciate that you were trying Mr Mouse!  And lionheart pointed me back to this thread, when I was pretty sure it was a lost cause.  I was so in awe that someone had figured something out!

Thanks everyone for your interest and support, and mad props to you Turfster.

I realise i have said this many times but "thankyou Turfster", you have made GREAT progress with this game.
Although I have posted as much help with files and Directories as Possible I dont tihnk that I have really been any help at this point.

Tho I do believe its a little Early ot be Celebrating, there are still quite a few things that are still undone.
Unless Turfster has decided that this is all he wants from this game, If so I thank him Greatly for his works upto this Point.
Oh and Turfter, Im still compiling all the Data about these Files into a little Guide as to whats what with this Particular game.
Ie: What files are what, What they hold, How the files were Originally Compiled, What Program they MAY have been made with (XSI im sure of it) and more.
TheDyingInformat doesnt really have me to thank for showing her this thread again, I also thought it was gonna die until Turfster came from the Heavens to Revive this long dead topic (While i was accidently Necro-ing it).
So thanks to Persistance and MUCH hard work, I think il donate now, that will be something I have done in Return.

Turfster in your Post you showed 3 images, Ak47, Suit case and a Helicopter, Would you mind telling me what folder Helicopter was in, As id like to look at this MODEL, maybe play around with its textures.

Upped a new [build](http://metalgear.turfster.be/) (20/07) that should now convert *all* kmy files without problems. If you find any that give random poly-soups or crash Solidus, mail me. Note that I know both raiden and snake's hair is messed up. This is (most probably, 99%) NOT my fault, but due to the Realistic Wavy Hair(tm) in the game.

It's hh60 in the d001p01 dir (first part of the plant intro demo).
There's also kck_504 in the d00t dir if you want the kasatka from the tanker intro demo movie.

Thanks man, I wondered what it was from.
Have you had a chance to look into the character Animations yet at all?
So far we have almost EVERYTHING FROM THIS GAME.
So i made a 10 second list of what we have.

```
- MODELS % - 99.9%(Only cos of the hair)
- MODEL TEXTURES = 99.9
- Codec text% - 20% 
- Music% - 0% 
- Character Animations% - 0%
- Other% ?.??%

```


btw: this is kinda off topic but Have u EVER tried ot hack the Metal Gear 3 game? I looked and found some codec stuff but NOTHING other hten that. 
I wonder if you made SOLIDUS search in files(.DAT) for USEABLE files 
would it be DAR/QAR aswell, i know MGS1 for PC used DAR and UR tool opens them.

Very useful info file Lionheart! You really explored well. Too bad I haven't had much time to, since getting ready for the trip I'm leaving for tomorrow.

I will help in letting you know that the PAC folder contains all of the ingame MOVIES (not CUTSCENES), such as all of the TV monitor displays, all of the artistic and 'flashback' parts of cutscenes to fill in information, all of the 'how to' videos that show you various basic gameplay moves and 'what this mission is' videos which show up when you select a VR or Alternative mission.  These are readily playable in Windows Media Player, but I'm not sure how to convert PAC to another format else (or vise versa).

I will also let you know that it is crucial to save newly made texture files as DDS rather than TGA. I'm not sure why this is, because TGA looks like it contains the alpha transparencies for hair and such, and also the 'shine effect'.  Or atleast, I'm not sure what is this they add to textures, to Snake for instance, he will have his face shading or something on a seperate area. in TGA you can see this if you make a new layer, move the original layer to the top, and then colour the background with red or something, u will see a 'negative' photo effect there, but I'm not sure what that is.

Anyway, when I saw some weirdness with my saved TGA file, I did a test and just extracted Snake's MGS1 costume textures in both TGA and DDS, and I didn't even TOUCH them, and then i put them BACK in the archive file to see the difference. The first thing I can note is that the filesize of the archive INCREASED even though I didn't add any new information to the textures, so I thought that was weird.  The 2nd thing is important to note too. Take a look:

[http://img86.imageshack.us/my.php?image ... atsdp5.jpg](http://img86.imageshack.us/my.php?image=fileformatsdp5.jpg)

Saving as TGA for some reason causes various problems. Strange coloured seams and lines in the hair, a slight overall discolouration of the whole texture, and slightly blurrier.  While the example on the right is exactly like how it looks by default, so you want it that way.

Again, I'm not sure what that extra shading is in some of these character textures. I will have to find out more about this when I come back.

I'm excited that all models are viewable now! I can't wait to play around with this.



If you want to know, Turfster, what more I want to see happen in future versions (again, at your convenience. Life happens =P ), it would be the following:


-I wish to be able to create HIGHER RES textures than what the game currently allows. this would probably have to mean larger texture maps as well. Are these editable yet?

-and to be able to have a Asymmetrical texture on a mostly symmetrical character. You know for instance, a character may have only one instance of their arm texture cause it just repeats it for the other side? Well what if I want to do something different for one side than the other side, for instance, random cuts and wounds?  I think this requires editing of the texture map too, because it has to map for one arm and then another arm, rather than one texture for both arms.

-I wish to edit and replace models back into the game,

-and to view and edit their animations

-I want the script to be editable one day, so for instance, we could make Olga playable in a new designed mission,  or Snake could be desquised as an enemy - an edited Snake model with the enemy AI even though his own attack and movement animations apply, and he'll have custom voice clips that can be supplied, meaning the appropriate DAT file has to be editable (I think its VOX dat).

-if we can access DAT files that would be great cause then we could take a look at MGS3 as well.


There's plenty that can be looked at, and I appreciate everything thats been done so far, so please don't doubt that!  In fact I still have much to play with of whats been done so far, but now I'm away for 2 weeks, so I won't be much help in that time, so I thought I should post first and let you know some of my ideas and confusion.

Thanks everyone!

Thanks everyone!
Thanks.
I comiled everything i have/ remember, But yes il make an update with the PAC folder informaiton.
Also the turorial on replacing textures WAS NOT written by ME it was written by Turfster himself.
To avoid any isses I have explained this in the Faq itself.

- Replacing the Models huh, Sounds to me like itd be reverse enginering of the CURRENT extract code.
Tho I have yet (if ever) to view the Source of Solidus so I cannot say for a fact b ut thats what id imaigne it'd entail.

- SCRIPT!! OMG! this would be VERY cool, but i dont think that its ACTUALLY possible, as the general things owuld be locked away so tightly u may never find them, this i KNOW will be the hardest thing to gain access to, IF its even possible itl take a long time and will be very complicated and will most likely require a WHOLE NEW program (Maybe a child of Solidus ie:Solidat (for dat files).

Access to the DAT files huh..
Hmmm.. I can look at the Snake Eater ones with the HEX edior and have even looked around for QAR and DAR archieves, I have FOUND many instanced of those letters used but i cannot determine if they are mearly coinsidence or ACTUAL archives, If we ARE able to access the .DAT fiels of MGS2 im almost POSOTIVE that they WONT b anything like the MGS3 ones, this minaly because a PS2 reads things differently and certian things have to be emulated, adn you cant really make the PS2 support new file types, you have to include the code to open them along with the game

Replacing game sounds: I DONT think this would be too hard i GUESS anyway, Just figurung how to extract them, then some reverse engineering is all, but  i can state that they WONT be in NORMAL formats, also the sounds for the GAMEPLAY CONTROLS and everything are held here NOT inside the movie files I ODN TIHNK, that exaplins y when watching some of them movies the sound can repeast but the VIDEO is not affected.

These are NOT 100% deffinate, they are just logical assumptions is all,

That's normal, I don't trim "empty" textures down to their smallest size like the Konami developers did.

Thanks for bringing this to my attention. It was all due to a stupid typo in my loading code -_-. Grab [build 1.5a](http://metalgear.turfster.be), where I fixed it.

Added this to the new build. You should now be able to use higher res textures without problems - keeping the same aspect ratio of course. Note that I'm not sure what the maximum texture size the game engine supports is, so it might be best to stick to 2048x2048 and below.

This'll require both texture and model editing, so it'll prolly take a while (if it ever happens).

This is probably next on my list, at least for the simple stuff (objects) to start with

Beh, I haven't even started on animations, since they're always a bitch and so depressing to try to figure out (The main reason why I stopped working on the Bloodrayne tool is due to the damn animations).

Script editing is a very, very, very big maybe, since this is one of the hardest things to figure out.

DAT files are probably not the same format in MGS 2 and 3. Hell, they aren't the same format in MGS 2.
* codec contains the codec text streams
* face contains... all the data in the face dir, only dumped in one big file without easy file indexing that I can see 
* the rest contain audio streams in some kind of ADPCM format.

Since I don't have a PS2, I don't have a copy of MGS3 and can't check.

Sorry, I never ever give out my code (mainly because it's fucking ugly and uncommented). I'll add the KMY format to the xentax wiki later, tho.


Also, I've added version 1.0 of a milkshape KMY import plugin to the site (mainly to see how hard it would be to port the code). Note that it suffers from the standard Milkshape "oh noes, too many vertices/triangles aaargh crash" problem, so you can't open the level data, but all the other models should load without problems.

Cool dude.
So you PLAN to go all the way with this game then?
Like get as MUCH as you can before it becomes a Burden.
I dont own/have Milkshape, as I use 3DS MAX instead (THIS loads ALL the textures AND THE FULL LEVELS).

Yeah i didnt expect youd let me take a look at the SOURCE, it was just out of chance lol.

Also i havent YET looked at the models in HEX editor so I am UNABLE to understand HOW the animations WORK.
THo i do have ONE important comment id like to make.
 - When I export the MODELS (CHARACTERS/GUARDS/HUMANS ONLY), It seems asthough the LEGS are ONE model and the TORSO/CHEST is another, BOTH ARMS are 1 model, and the FEET seem ot be seperate form everything else but still one model.
I am not sure IF this is how it was actually made or if its how you have CONVERTED them.
Thou i have JUST thought that maybe they are a group(the arms i mean, everything else is its OWN group) so maybe THATS why when i select 1 arm it also selects the other.
I will look into this, tho I am sure i have checked it before.

Is the SOUND in ANYWAY exportable? Or maybe CONVERTABLE if its exportable?

I usually keep working on stuff until I get bored/distracted/run into a brick wall, so I'll see how far I can get.

Yes, I know, but it's easier for me to write plugins for milkshape 
(also, I don't have max, so I'd have to use gmax, which is a pain to use)

This is due to the conversion, yes. I basically group objects per material when extracting to OBJ, since they're all static objects anyway.

> Reply from lionheartuk

exporting shouldn't be too much of a problem, but then I'd still be stuck on  converting it to anything *useable*. The PS2 ADPCM format has eluded my comprehension for ages (since I worked on the prince of persia trilogy, basically), and I haven't made any progress since. Guess I'm more a graphics/3D man than a sound man.

Think you could somehow CHANGE this man?
As i animate the models and learn programs while making cool animations. So if there is a way to leave the MODELS in their ORIGINAL state can u maybe try and look into this PLEASE man.
It'd be REALLY cool, as its harder to have to break models up in 3DMAX ect, as it takes a while depending on the model.
If u can do that then its a step closer to animations, as you will NEED to do this i guess if u ever start looking in to animation section.

1 question tho
 - I have looked TIRELESSLY for the RAIDEN NINJA model, I have located the texture several times, but NOT the models, I even found the HELMET he wears, CAN ANYONE point me in the direction of the MODEL itself?

Oh yeah i almost forgot, any news on the CODEC text at all man, tho i am unsure WHY anyone would wish to edit the codec text, as the voices wil just say the same thing anyways, I doubt id use it for MUCH tho itd be cool to mess around with ie: "Colonel this is Raiden! iv made it onto the shell" Colonel:"Um.. WTF! i dont care im trying to propose to my goldfish here, cant u see im busy!", BAD example but just a joke lol

Well, the current models are all *static*, so they're not *supposed* to be animated, but you can grab a shareware copy of milkshape and my plugin, load the model you want and export to whatever format you're interested in. The plugin loads the models the way they're stored.

Probably one of the non-statics (I'm guessing the evx files), which I haven't looked at yet, so you'll have to wait.

Haven't done anything with it lately, it was basically a request from someone so they could translate the codec text into their own language.

Oh i c, il try it then, i guess i'll have to Download milksape shareware then.

Probably one of the non-statics (I'm guessing the evx files), which I haven't looked at yet, so you'll have to wait.
Oh so THATS what the EVX files are for, Ohhh that makes sense now, I'll look into a few of them with the HEX VIEWER and se what I can tell you.
Tho tbh is doesnt make any sense if the EVX files contain MODELS "WITH"animations, It would make more sense if the EVX files contained the BONES/VERTEX animation coordinates(ie tell the LEG how much to bend ect,il see if i can find a program that opens the EVX files for you.

Oh i c now lol, THo itl stick suck a bit if the game speach is still in ENGLISH, UNLESS its NOT for that version.
I wonder... I know japanese has its own Voices, But im not sure about anywhere else, I tihnk its only the subs.
Am i right?

Sorry dude.
I cant find anything within any of the other MGS2 files.
The EVX files are a complete mystrey to me, they just seem to contain the Alphabet at least 100 times lol, just loads of ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ one after the other, not even gaps).
I downloaded Milkshape 3D but it just ses the version has already expired, I cant even IMPORT any KMY files at all, only ofical ones such as OBJ.
I cant export anything either, KInda sucks, Is there anyway to get around this?
I dont wanna have to pay or anything.
I dont mean like Pirateing the Software or anything, Just some way to make saving avaliable again without Registering or Paying.
If you could make a plugin for 3D Studio MAX or XSI then thatd be great (3D MAX preferably as im still not good with XSI yet).
thanks

New build [up](http://metalgear.turfster.be/), now has 2 object exporting options, either the old way (concatenate by texture) or the way the milkshape plugin loads the model (stick to submesh definitions).

I can just EXPORT it the way it was made and it'l be in whatever format, ie: OBJ

Yeah sorry i couldnt find anything on the EVX files man.
I looked at a few and nothing.
Have you gotten any more news on anything OTHER then exporting>
Ie: Replacing Models, Animations for Models, Music.

Hi all.

lionheartuk
If you need a registered Milkshape, download the official Medal of Honor: Pacific Assault MDK (v1.1), install it (need .NET Framwork 1.1), and you have a registered Milkshape 1.7.1.

Turfster
I found a bug.
If I replace the first file in the qar (cache.qar->2Dtex), the new qar file is bigger, as the source qar. (2Dtex== new 2Dtex)
If the replaced file is not the first, no problem.

[Solidus Xp mainfest](http://evin.uw.hu/solidus_man.zip) Extract to the Solidus.exe folder.



Oh, and anybody know, where is the Life bar textures?

Weve all found this.
But its NOT a bug.
The game still READS the file in the SAME way.
Of course if you are to replace textures with HIGHER RES trxtures like we are doing then it WILL get bigger.
Alos WHAT exactly does you atachment do?

If I extract the first file from the cache.qar, and replace the extracted file(no editing) with the qar first file, the qar file size is bigger. And just then.
I'm not create high res textures.

Sorry, if this is not clear, but my english is weak.

This is just an external XP manifest for XP style support.

Hello People, This is my first post ever on a forum and I just wanna say this has to be the BEST forum topic to ever be formed! This is exactly what i've been searching for since I played MGS! Really is a dream come true! Thank you, Thank you so much!

Now all the introductions are out of the way...


Turfster:

I've got a couple of ideas to make Solidus easier to use, could you add a heading to the lists that are extracted from the DAR and QARs to show the size of each file, like in explorer when you do view by details, and gives you options to view by size, name type etc. That would be much appreciated and would make it a whole lot easier to find the files.

Is it also possible to extract the files and make the tga /dds and obj files in one go, rather having to extract them and choose them again to extract?

I'm sorry if this sounds like i'm demanding a lot, its just to improve the searching speed to find the files quicker.


Lionheartuk:

Excellent document on getting started with 'Solidus'. Could you list some of the folders where you found the main character and vehicle meshes and textures, that would be great!


TheDyingInformant:

I'm a crazy graphics artist, who's also a MGS freak, and I was looking to create a few hi-res textures for mgs. Wanna start something? I'm pretty good with characters and environments ( well, so I hope...). I'll post some of my work if I can. This would be excellent for my portfolio and also us MGS fans. Let me know what you think.

So far i have found the following Models and Textures:
Snake
MG1Snake
Tuxedo Snake
Raiden
Raiden Diving swim suit
Raiden Naked.
Raiden With Wigs
Solidus
Fortune
Vamp
Submerine
Fat Man
Olga
Colonel
Otacon

Rats.
Metal gear Ray from tanker(Experimental) and Mass Production
ALL Soldiers.
HH60
F19 (I THINK its an F19 i cant remember)
ALL Hostages
Navy Seals.
Tanker residents (Dead of course)

There are a LOT more I have found, but I dont have the time to list them ALL right now.

Thanks lionheartuk,

Yeah i'd like the models and textures for the following please:

Snake
Raiden
solidus
vamp
Metal Gear Ray Tanker
All soldiers, (apologies if this is a long list)
all the MGS 1 models, does it have Liquid Snake?

any interesting levels you have found. Sorry this vague.

BTW I have 3D Max and I import the models into MAX but then I have to apply each texture individually, using the dropper tool and then going into the diffuse maps and then choosing the texture. Is there a quicker way to apply the textures to the models on import?

Snake = ALL the Tanker scenes(fiels with D in them, NOT the ones with P)
Raiden = MOST files but the D03p type ones are the plant demo data so he is in them.
Solidus = hmmm... TRY the FINAL folders with d__p in them
Vamp = d055po1 (Yeah Raiden and a SEAL are here too)
Guards = MOST folders to be honest (names like TNG and stuff NOT named GUARD1)
Ray Tanker = the FINAL tanker cutscenes(look at my guide)
MGS1 models? there only SNAKE and Ocellot(why wud there be any others, LIQUID isnt even in the game AT ALL except in 3 images that are flashbacks)

> any interesting levels you have found. Sorry this vague.
Well HOLD 3 was a nice one, i STILL have it in MAX noq but NOT the textures, Arsenals belly was a ncie one too, MOST are OK, i prefer the TANKER ones tho.

> Is there a quicker way to apply the textures to the models on import?
lol, this annoyed ME too, just open the OBJ files in MAX, THEN jsut RENDER the image, then the textures will appear (or itl tell u there not there), they DONT appear in PERSPECTIVE view, ONLY when u render them.
3DS MAX DOESNT support external files correctly so there only there when rendered, but u can ANIMATE and everything and its all fine.
I hope that helps.
Read through my guide again to check wat files hold WHAT ect...

one question, is it possible to extract the lights for the scene aswell? or is this still work in progress with the animation files?

MGS has still got top notch GFX even though its an early PS2 game!

If so the NO sorry, Why would you want this anyways?
Oh yeah if you SOMEHOW run across the Ninja textures or Model, PLEASE TELL ME WHERE U GOT IT.
I been loking AGES.
Actually MGS graphics ARNT that FANTASTIC, it RARELY uses REAL shadows, MANY of the shadows are just  DARKENED areas of a texture.
I thought this game had FANTASTIC graphics but overall its pretty standard if you ask me.
Then agian ALL games would look bad if they never had FANTASTIC textures i guess.

I know this manifest is nothing, but somebody need it. Maybe...

I just few thing know:
The xti files is dds file, just the header different. (not the content)
And I translate the game to other language, and I know the non english case.

XTI files I had already understood due to Looking at them with Hex EDITORS ECT.
I am not really all that interested in textures, now animations YES.
Any chance you could look into how THEY work or at LEAST what files hold the data.
Even if you CANT figure out hwo they work or anything MAYBE u can find out enuf info to post here to shpow us and WE'LL try soemthing form it, Or maybe TURFSER will do it.
I not sure where he is now, Tho i dont imagine he quit or anything, Maybe takign a break.
Who knows tho maybe he not sleep ano more from trying this game 24/7 lol.

I was asking if it was possible to extract the lighting because that would help me understand how the lighting is done for each particular level, eg, the tanker level outdoors, night scene or the indoor scenes etc.

The animations would be extremely helpful too! Let me know if there are any developments.

Well I am back, and excited to play around with this more.   But I did find a problem with trying to create higher res textures now. Turfster, when you come back around, maybe you could answer this one for me?

Added this to the new build. You should now be able to use higher res textures without problems - keeping the same aspect ratio of course. Note that I'm not sure what the maximum texture size the game engine supports is, so it might be best to stick to 2048x2048 and below.

Well I'm thinking the game code is strictly written up to not allow higher res textures in. I can't seem to create higher res textures without the game crashing.  I have tried to make a texture double the resolution and also triple, but the game crashes. So for instance, a 256x256 texture has to remain the same resolution.

Is there any way we can figure out where this limit lies and how to get around it? That would be great.

Animations yeah, I think animations are usually the hardest part to figure out in games.  Take Sims 2 for instance. People have been able to edit almost every aspect of the game so far, but the animations have been the most difficult to figure out, there for it hasn't come a long way. I doubt MGS2 is any easier.  Consider this if you are bored one day or if you really wish to figure it out.

Also Turfster, I really thank you for doing all this, but I want to make a suggestion to you now.  The guys who were previously trying to modify Substance gave up on it and in addition, didn't even share their findings with anyone else. Should the unfortunate situation come about for you one of these days that you don't want to work on this anymore (   )  please share your findings so that someone else may continue your work. That would be great of you.    

But ofcourse, there's no rush anyway. I'm just glad this is all happening.  I can't wait for when we can modify and replace models, cause I'll be having a lot of fun with that. But I also wish I could create higher res textures - although I'm not much of a texture artist yet, I was definitely going to continue practicing with it for this.  But for some reason it crashes!

I think, the qar file is the size limited.
If the qar is bigger as ~14800KB(n_title), the game not run, on me.

Finally I find the Life bar, and the HUD text. 

I have a tip, to the xti->dds converting.(if not 256x256, 512x512...)
Need the texture width. This dimension the Solidus read out from the xti.
Theoretically, here is the width dim.: 71h-72h (but this is not for sure)
This is the formula:
( [xti full size]-[header size] )/[width dimension by Solidus]=[height dimension]

Hey there folks, I came across this solidus program, it looks really cool, but I'm having some problems with it. Everytime I export a KMY file, and then re-open it, it gives me an "1.000 is not a valid floating point value", also, milkshape does not seem to like it when I import it via the importer, it crashes regardless with every kmy file I have extracted ( so far ). Anyone got a clue about this? Tried e-mailing the author, but havent got a reply from him.

This HUD text is in the .EXE:
Life, Weapon, "Weapon list (Grenade, psg-1...)", Equip, Time, Time left

Overwrite the Life text (sample: Lifa), and you see in the game.

I don't no what is the Kenshinsx.

So did you guys say the models are broken into pieces? Like, humans are broken into limbs or something? Is there any way to view a complete character?  Are their textures attached, or you can load them up, onto the character?

What programs can I do this with? Will it work with Maya 5?

Sorry lol CURRENTLY we DONT know what the .02d files are for, we have our ideas tho, thinking, i DONT think its the animations tho.

> Every model I try to import crashes Milkshape.What am I doing wrong?By the way,it says on Solidus site that you can convert KMY models to OBJ with Solidus.How can I do it?
one you select you models to EXTRACT (with solidus) it'l OUTPUT the file, just OPEN the NEW file with SOLIDUS and it will CONVERT it to OBJ instantly.
btw you CANT import the LEVEL models as milshape CANT take that many polygons and it screws over on you lol.

Maya.. I think so, tho im NOT sure if itl work PERFECTLY (WITH textures), EXTRACT the textures as the SECOND option and itl work FINE, I use 3D Studio MAX and the MODELS import fine but the textures ONLY show when you RENDER (no idea why lol).
Yes the models from this game are split into MANY part(arm,leg,head,ect).

Also i FOUND the ninja.
NEW version of MGS2 SUBSTANCE FAQ in Progress NOW, added 20 models so far, UPDATED MOST locations, things are a bit more in depth ect.
If anyone wants to know anything else or has any OTHER questions abotut his games file then PLEASE tell me and il inclde them into the FAQ

Just one more offtopic shot : 

Here's an image of the aquired Metal Gear 1 for MSX computers. I remember playing this game to death at a friends house. His dad bought all Konami stuff when it came out, and I was dead jealous. But man, did we have fun playing that game. And now, finally, it is in my possession!

I did it now,but it gives a error (same as  Kenshinsx)
Hmmm...
Well the models seem a bit big anyways with this size output so change the value in SOLIDUS options (FINAL tab) to 0.0005.
If THAT doesnt work then maybe change it between the two export options Sub mesh and Texture Mesh.
THAT SHOULD FIX UR PROBLEMS PEOPLE.

lol, I never completed number 1 lol only number 2, tho i have never played it in english as the translations were a bit off.
Yes, i am fluent in Japanese (My 2nd language)) so THATS how i played it lol
Back to Topic:
Any news from Turfster?
Is he continueing this Project, I knwo he was tihnking of working on the animations, and he always ses "The animations are the one thing that makes me hit a dead end and i beign to lose interest in it" ect...
I hope he hasnt stopped.
Id like to se more Progress on this myself.
If he HAS left, hypathetically, then any chance YOU could take a look into this game at all?
I know MOST of the relevant information for the files ect if you needed my help at all.

Hmmm.... This looks a tad confusing (no offense Turfster cause I really love Solidus! Err.... the program not the character! =P  )

But yeah, it may be a handy idea Lionheart or Turfster to add the model export instructions (and all that is related) into a help file, so that people understand what works, what doesn't work, how to do it. That would be great!  Oh yeah and how to make high resolution textures.... because that doesn't seem to be working for me either.



Mr. Mouse: 
Wow, cool!  OMG, didn't that cost you a fortune? lol.  Handy for really serious collectors I'm sure. I'm a collector too, but not in general, just of some things Metal Gear - for instance, the artbooks, soundtracks, and I have the $300 MGS3 Snake figure. Its REALLY badass.  But yeah, Metal Gear 1 and 2 are included actually in Metal Gear Solid 3: Subsistence on Playstation 2, which I highly recommend to ANY Metal Gear fan, its packed full of fun content. Hah, I still have yet to check out the original games! Awwww I bet they're cuuuuute...   


Oh yeah and don't worry about Turfster I'm sure. Whats 3 weeks compared to three YEARS?  I'm happy about all of this, he can take his time since he's blessed us with this. Hah, now Lionheart, don't go scaring him off with animation requests! I'm sure he'll look into it if he really wants to, but maybe that will be a task for someone else.

Ok then il ake a little HELP file for SOLIDUS, Il include it in my GUIDE this time.
I dont understand WHY so you all have this error I have never seen it before.

> I'm sure Turfster will be back. Holiday slum perhaps.
Im sure your right.
Theres still a lot of work for me to do anyways, with FILE TYPES and guides fro the Program and everything.
So il be busy for  awhile anyways.

Ok here is  a quick guide I created on how to extract the Metal Gear Solid 2:Substance models.



1: Select the options you want.
Conversion Modes:
Concentate By Textures = Groups the models vertexs by what textures are used (Ie: Arms are count as 1 object as they use SAME textures often)

Stick to Submesh Deformations = Export the models in their IRIGINAL mesh, as in EXACT to the way that they were made( arm = 3 parts ect)

Scale Factor =  How much you want to scale the model BEST to use 0.0005 or 1.0000

Single Texture Extraction = Extract the texture MAP exactly.
Subtextures = Exports the texture maps in parts (NEEDED for texturing models)

2: Select the KMY file you WISH to extract and EXTRACT IT.

3: Now you should see YOUR extracted model(SHOULD have the SAME icon as solidus), See mine GBS_hand_def on the left.


Open your EXTRACTED .KMY file with Solidus and you should get all this stuff at the bottom tellign you what action Solidus is performing, a few seconds later your model SHOULD have extracted.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I dont think that there is really MORE to explain, if ANYONE is unsure of anything then just ask and il help.

NOTE: you CANT export WITHIN the game DVD you MUST copy the folder 1st (for some reason i bet SOMEONE isnt doing this simple thing)
NOTE: if you CANT get it to work STILL then tell me WHAT file you are ATTEMPTING to convert and send me it, Maybe its ONE file that errors up, I have converted 90% of the game and am YET to encounter ANY errors whatsoever.

Note 3: your ALL using the most UP TO DATE version Of Solidus yeah? as the 1ST version that exported MODELS only exported SIMPLE ones, NOT anything with over a certain number of POLYGONS, tho NOW the NEWEST version is unlimited and can be found HERE http://metalgear.turfster.be/
 I hope Turfster doesn mind me Linking to his little space (I forgot what there called lol), if he does il have to remove this link I GUESS.

Thanks very much for that Lionheart!

Question for you though. You said you are exploring the models with 3D Studio Max right?  So does that software support KMY or the OBJ files, or did you have a plug in that converts them?

I'm asking because, I'm about to reinstall Maya for trying this, and then I went back to read Turfsters' message that he has yet to make a conversion for that program. Obviously you can not answer about that program if thats not what you use, but I'm wondering how come you got it to work in 3D Studio because it isn't designed for that program - so find yourself lucky I guess! I just wonder, what program do I need for these models at this point?  Do you think Maya will work? Well maybe there is a conversion plug in I can find. I'll take a look. 

You also say the models are in seperate pieces, so if say, I want to view the entire Solid Snake model, does that mean I have to import all the limbs and pieces together? lol
Does anyone know what program MGS2 was made with? MGS3 was made with SoftImage but MGS2 might not have been the same case. I'm just curious. I wish I had 3D Studio if it works great for you Lionheart! Ack! Why are there so many dang 3D programs.... why can't the companies just merge together to create one all-around powerful and user friendly program?

MGS was also created with softimage XSI.
As for th emodels in PARTS what i mean is:
say u export "Snake_def.kmy" its the FULL model of SNAKE itl just be in parts when u open it is all, itl all be arranged correctly its only in parts so thats it easier to animate and stuff.

MAYA WILL import .OBJ files,(you need to go to IMPORT tho NOT open) the same way as 3D studio max, no PLUGINS required, almost ALL 3d programs USE .OBJ as its the simplst and SMALLEST file format that is easiest to convert with out ERRORS of anysort.

Maya and 3DSMAX have converted BTW, now there ONE and the same company, ALIAS took over MAYA, now the two programs are merged to create a better Program, tho i tihnk it still has the HORRIBLE MAYA GUI (i hate that its so stupid)

Even with that guide I still get that floating point error, with 0.0005 and 1.000, with the exact same file you are using. So it does not work. And I'm giving up now, I tried everything, it simple does not do what people say it does.

I used the same settings as you have, and I used the latest version of solidus too.

Please could you UPLOAD the file that DOESNT work.
Also are you SURE you ahve followed my tut exactly?
Only KMY files can be converted.
The REST were unsure of what they do, im slowly trying to understnad the rest of them.
As im rather confused as to WHY this problem has started to spread.
I have NEVER tried this Program on ANYTHING other then XP so if ANY of you are using OTHER operating Systems then this MAY be the CAUSE.

well, if you look at my screenshot, you will see e:\program files  , I don't use it from my dvd, but from the installed game itself

E:\ doesnt always have to be a dvd drive if you have more then 2 harddrives you know ;P

system OS is XP sp2, and now that I know that im not the only one with the problem, I'm more then sure that it lies with the problem itself. Floating point errors come from the program itself. Perhaps you'r using a diffirent version then the rest of us

Hm...
I have the SAME version as you, judging from your screenshot anyways.
Hm...
I am unsure atm.
Can you PLEASE send me or ATTACH one of the FILES that doesnt work, be it a .KMY or another file.
Btw i thought that MAYBE you had 2 Hard drives but i just assumed it was the DVD drive.

Thanks very much! OMG this really works!!!

Hey, but I need to ask for further assistance (if you don't mind).  

Where can I find the HIGH RES Solid Snake model? Because even when I check in the Stage the D folders, Snake has a lower res model.  It's usually called 'sna_def.kmy'. But I need the one where he has more facial details, and eyeballs. Also, where do I find the higher detailed hands (has seperate fingers, looks more realistic)?  For instance, there would be a file called 'sna_def_addhand' and it ends with .evx  so I'm not sure what that is.

I also want to see the high res Pliskin model, without headphones on, and the one where has the balaclava on.

I also found the Raiden model, but he doesn't have any hair! He has an open skull-lol.

Well, I'll play with this more and see what I can find out. But any help would be great, and thanks for your help so far!

This is soooo damn cool!!


P.S.  Oh! And how do I get the textures put on?  I know it will be different in Maya, but how did you go about it Lionheart?

Well the STAGE folder are for INGAME so they dont REALLY need higher res models, you BEST bet is the DEMO folders, they hold the info for the CUTSCENES.

> I also found the Raiden model, but he doesn't have any hair! He has an open skull-lol.
Yeah that is a problem caused by the fact that the hair is controlled seperatly as its made so realistically. you should extract rai_hair_bounding (or sometihng like that) and it SHOULD work ok then.

> P.S.  Oh! And how do I get the textures put on?  I know it will be different in Maya, but how did you go about it Lionheart?
Well make sure for 1 that you export the tetures as Subtextures (NEEDED).
2: open the model in MAYA (also its BEST to change the PERSPECTIVE view to textured to see if that helps), then RENDER your SCENE and see if you can see them then.
In MAX i can ONLY see the textures when I render.

> Folders d001p1, d021p1, r_vr_b. Example of r_vr_b included well I jsut TRIED it and it works FINE perfectly for me, Maybe you need ot UPDATE some Drivers on your PC (OPENGL or DIRECT X perhaps).
Also if oyur PC is OLD that MAY effect something, tho im not sure its just  a guess.

Hm...
Well the files I was sent by YOU work FINE for me.
Are you SURE you only have 1 solidus file on you ENTIRE PC, as the files MAY be reading from an OLDER version.
DELETE ALL solidus files and REDOWNLOAD vthe NEWEST version, all SHOULD be fine then.
But anyways HERE is the file you sent me.
I have EXTRACTED and CONVERTED the files to OBJ as i ASSUMED that you wanted them anyways lol.

Well the STAGE folder are for INGAME so they dont REALLY need higher res models, you BEST bet is the DEMO folders, they hold the info for the CUTSCENES.

Yes. That's where I looked. The DEMO folders all start with D WITHEN the stage folder, remember? You said it yourself in your FAQ:

"Stage - many folders named:	- D--t and D--p-- ect, these contain demo data. T =tanker P = plant
                                  : -- is the Demo number which the folder hold the info for.
Example files are  D001t (Tanker 1st demo), D001p01(Plant)"

I know I'm looking in the right place. But why am I not seeing the headphone-less Pliskin with detailed hands?  This is what I found:

iro_def_sh_mt.kmy

This is the full-res Pliskin (his face) wearing headphones. Also with the blockier in-game hands.  Even though it is in the cutscene after Emma goes across the oilfence (in the computer room with the parrot. I won't say spoilers =P )

Then I also see these:

iro_takeoff_mh_mt.evx
iro_takeoff_addhand_mh_mt.evx

That might mean to me the take-off headphones head - a piece of model from elsewhere. And same idea with 'addhand' I guess.  But these are not in .kmy format. So I'm guessing you have not seen what these are either?  Does this mean that not ALL of the models are viewable?

Have you even seen the high-res hands from withen gameplay levels? Cause you know how in first person view, they show their arms and hands in higher quality (model and texture).

Take a screenshot for me of any of these things please.    

> Yeah that is a problem caused by the fact that the hair is controlled seperatly as its made so realistically. you should extract rai_hair_bounding (or sometihng like that) and it SHOULD work ok then.

Well, I tried that and it didn't work.  But I will worry about Raiden later. One thing at a time I guess.


> Well make sure for 1 that you export the tetures as Subtextures (NEEDED).

Yep. Did that.  Extracted the textures with that option enabled, and in the same directory as the models.

> 2: open the model in MAYA (also its BEST to change the PERSPECTIVE view to textured to see if that helps), then RENDER your SCENE and see if you can see them then.
>
> In MAX i can ONLY see the textures when I render.

I tried both. Nothing is working >.<  First I press the button that shows textures on the model, but all I got was this shiney white colour on the model. Then I tried to render, but frankly, I have never done that before and I don't know how to do it.... I tried 'render current frame' but I'm not even sure if this does anything for a model before you set up animations and lighting and effects and stuff.  I'm quite new to some of this stuff....

Additionally, I tried also the demo version of 'Polytrans for Maya' which allows you to convert to and from many formats.  .OBJ was there, but as you said, Maya already imports that so thats ok. But still, I tried this, and there was an option to also import the .mtl  texture files.....AHA! But not really..... It gave me an error and nothing showed up >.<  I'll have to email them about that.

I guess it would help if I wasn't so rusty with Maya (and I only learned principles of 3D modelling, not much of texturing, and nothing of rendering).  

Please! Can anyone familiar with Maya help me out here?  There must be a way for these textures to show up on the model, if the .obj format is importable....  Maybe the .mtl isn't compatible with Maya?  What is that file anyway? Texture mapping?  And I'd also like to find these other head and hand models for Pliskin!


By the way, thanks for the new Filesexplanation text! You still forgot to add that PAC contains all of the little video files in the game.  You don't have the DVD at the moment, but are you saying you don't have these files?  I wonder if you don't see any videos inside Substance...

Anyway, thanks so much in advance!

Ok!  I solved one problem, though I am still working through more.

Maya users!  What happened for me in Maya 5 is this:  The textures wouldn't show up on models, because for some reason the program saw the textures with a period in front of their name. For instance  .002375696.tga (or whatever), but its not supposed to have the period. I have no idea why this happens but its very easy to correct it:

1) Go to Window > Rendering editors > Hypershade.

2) In Hypershade, click the TEXTURES tab.

3) Here you should see several empty boxes. Click the first one, and then go back to the main window so that you will now have an options box on the right.

4) See where it says 'Image Name' and it shows where it found the texture file?  See how it has a period in front? Simply delete that period, press enter.

5) Now go back to hypershade and keep doing this in every black box, which represents a texture that isn't showing up.  Once you fix the texture, it shows up there.

6) After you fixed ALL of them, NOW when you press 6 on the main views it will display textures!  Or alternatively, if you already pressed 6 originally, then every texture you fixed will show up.


Now this is still a work in progress because I don't understand why the textures look like CRAP (worse than the game), also the alpha/transparencies of the textures aren't showing up.  I haven't touched Maya in many months and I was already a noob with texturing back then!  So if anyone has any other ideas and suggestions on how to make the textures appear as NORMAL, I'd really appreciate it!

And I want to know where the heck do you find the high res hands of the characters....  and why does Pliskin not have his TEETH, etc.  It is strange that some of these parts are elsewhere, hmm?

OK, I'm pretty sure I know what the problem is.
Your regional settings use "," instead of "." for decimal point, which was supposed to be trapped, but apparently fucked up for the scale input.
Anyway, try the new build on the site and see if it still croaks.

You're right, stupid delphi quirk. Should be fixed now.

Is it also possible to extract the files and make the tga /dds and obj files in one go, rather having to extract them and choose them again to extract?
Quick-fixed, new "convert" option.

> Well I'm thinking the game code is strictly written up to not allow higher res textures in. I can't seem to create higher res textures without the game crashing.  I have tried to make a texture double the resolution and also triple, but the game crashes. So for instance, a 256x256 texture has to remain the same resolution.
I've tested it with my trusty friend node_title_tex, and I could scale it up to 1024x1024 without problems (original is 512x512). Dunno why it doesn't work for you.

Latest build can be found on the [site](http://metalgear.turfster.be/), as usual.

thata ok man.
I TOO have bene swamped with WORK lol.
So your work ISNT as SWAPMED anymore?
Any other Progress other then the little FIXES?

Have you read my FAQ for this game?
If so im wondering what if any the mistakes are, like What certain folders contain ect or what certain files do.
I have encountered a CERTAIN mgs2 file that ocntians something VERY unexpected when i viewed it with the HEX editor.
It may ACTUALLY offend people so I cannot POST the image here as it contains MANY offensive words and a racist word.
NOTE: i DID NOT write this into the HEX editor myself, it seems to be that way, i tihnk its VERY odd indeed CONSIDERING THE NORMAL text BEFORE it.
REQ: In your tool for Tomb Raider Legend you made a small model/texture view at the side of the Program itself, would it be possible to include this into the Solidus Program at all?
As its VERY oftent hat we are all mislead by a file name and it turns outt o be something USELESS like a pole or a fence lol, or a hand.
I thought THIS might make it EASIER to find your CORRECT model.
Any thoughts on this man?

Thanks Turfster, now the program and the MS3D plugin works smoothly.
BTW, Can anyone tell me where's Raiden with the swimming mask?

You mean the Diving costume i take it.
Look in my FAQ itl tell you where MOST of the models your after are located, and what folders are what ect.
But for the Raiden one your best to try the EARLY d00p01 and them EARLY files BELOW 5 and youl find it soon enough.

Welcome back Turfster!  Thanks for the update!    

I have a question maybe you can answer for me.... I think I've figured out why I haven't been able to display the transparency textures properly in Maya (such as Snake's hair). Sure part of it has to do with Maya what I can't understand, but part of it must be the way the MGS2 textures are saved and this is what I want to know from you....

See, this doesn't make much sense to me. it is like the MGS2 textures have the alpha files built into the same file, or something.... You see, you know how in Photoshop the transparent type textures, in TGA format, are shown in just ONE layer - the main texture viewable, and everything else around it is clear, because nothing is supposed to show there.  But, in a different image program which I guess displays TGA differently, this same file will just be a completely coloured texture, showing the details of the hairs but also everything surrounding it is visable.

This is interesting and baffling to me because, when I export Sims 2 textures for instance, you get atleast 2 seperate files: the texture, and the alpha channel - what is going to be shown and what will be hidden - as a seperate file. but the game uses BOTH during the game. And ofcourse, if there is a bump map texture, but that's a different story.

ANYWAY, so I'm just wondering, does MGS2 seem to include the alpha file built into the same texture file, and some programs can't display it properly?

Do you have access to the seperate alpha files? For instance, if we had the texture of the parrots' feathers, then we would have another file to go with it - the black and white alpha file, showing what is meant to be transparent. MGS2 doesn't include seperate files for this?

I just wonder Turfster if you could explain that a bit, and if we could have access to the alpha files too, that would be great.

Oh yes Dyinginformant can you plese come on MSN as soon as possible, I need your help with a few things, and there is SOMETHING i want to show you regarding one of the files from this game, a most Unusual find i must add.

Has anyone found any cool things within this game yet?
Ie: cool levels ect,
Also Turfster, i think that you have most likely NOT begun the Animations or maed any more Progress on this Program but still il ask anyways.
Any news? Animation wise or even for ANYTHING else, maybe MODEL replacing.

Uh, the textures include alpha yes (standard 32 bit RGBA, after all).
It would surprise me if Maya didn't support textures with transparency out of the box, but then I've never used it. Maybe you have to explicitly set the fact that it's a transparent texture somewhere in the texture options?
I guess I *could* add an option to export the alpha info to a new file, but I don't see how that would help much. Alternatively, you can view just the alpha layer in photoshop, select all, copy this info to a new canvas and save it to get your alpha info separately (I'd rather you test it first before I start adding options nobody really needs, if it's the same to you)


In other news: there is no news 
I haven't really done any coding the last few days apart from the fixes, I just don't feel like it at the moment

does anyone know of any programs that can unpack files from a ps2 dvd? if there's a chance mgs3 uses the same file types, it would be a wonderful thing, but aside from that there's always the document of mgs2 dvd to consider. there's no pc equivalent and i'm sure that stage and character models are organized much more conveniently on that disc, therefore making extraction much easier.

Well the Document is just the same as the OC version everything is the same.
But in the PS2 version things are HARDER to crack into bcause they are better Encrypted and stuff.
MGS3 DOESNT use th same file formats, I have been looking into it for a few days now.
MGS3 uses a totally different type of file system, not to mention the fact that its so well encoded, everyitme i think i found something it ends up as at LEAST 20 something @ symbols ie: @@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@, theres no way i cna think of to sort this out, I need the help of a more xperianced person at HEX EDITING to do it.
Also please do not post MGS3 stuff here I have made a topic for that already.

Well actually, see the actual problem is that I do not see ANY alpha channel in the transparent type textures. I wonder if it is cause I have Photoshop 7. The files are just a transparent texture, single layer (which Maya doesn't support that way, it needs an alpha channel). I go into the channels box of PS and only the RGB colour files are in there, but no alpha mask.  Nope, I do not have to make a seperate FILE for the alpha mask, but I do have to include an alpha WITHEN that file.  Which is simply done by selecting the texture and making it into an alpha channel.

So anyhow, don't worry about it. I have the work around. And besides, I'm gonna be creating all new sharper textures for the characters (although I still have yet to see it working for myself), so I don't really need to worry about the current ones. Just to use them as a reference really.




Now then, I looked through some of the .dar files in the D/demo folders (in stage) once again, and I can tell for SURE that .EVX is some model files and will be very handy to get hold of (I know I want it).  But, much to Turfster's dismay, I think these files may have something to do with animation.

I have included a few files as an example, and files I want access to.

These were found in the cache.dar of  stage > d010p01.  These are Pliskin with his balaclava mask on, without it on, and with the hands on ('add hands').  Now, I don't understand why these are seperate files and not .KMY models, but it could be because animations are ALWAYS associated with these .EVX files?  Whether it is facial expressions or hands animations, or the fact that they add these pieces on seperately especially for cutscenes - I dunno.  But interesting to note is also if you look in the FACE folders for the codec.  See any KMY models there? Hardly anything.  You see information for Snake, Otacon, Raiden etc, and they are of .EVX  Maybe because these are not full models but head and shoulders (I assume because of the colonel model in The Document), which also have a face set up for animation.

Anyhow the POINT is, if Turfster, Lionheart, Mr Mouse or anyone else for that matter could please look into the .evx models and make them usable in 3D software, that would be GREAT!   But there is no rush ofcourse. Just at your convenience. I hope the attachment helps too.     

I also don't know what .cvy and some of those other files are. But we may not really need them either.

That's weird. The copy of PS CS2 I use at work loads them fine, with RGB and alpha channels separate. Have you tried using [this patch](http://www.adobe.com/support/downloads/detail.jsp?ftpID=1544)? I don't know if it'll help, but I don't know what else it could be.
I'm 100% sure the problem isn't the TGA files, anyway.

Yes, I know =p
They're next on my list, don't worry.
I'll get to them one of these days when I feel like coding again and have the time, maybe next week.

cool.
Im looked at a few of them but I couldnt find any usable information fomr them, I mean not even a friggin GRAIS, then again my HEX skills need improving, Im working on MGS3 atm so i dont get much time.
But if i find anything in this game il mail u instantly ok Turfster.

Thanks for that patch. I'll try it.

Well I checked again for some more models and we aren't just talking a lack of hands here or something. I can't find Ocelot, Liquid/Ocelot, Olga from the plant, but I DO see them there as .EVX.  So yeah, that will be great whenever you get around to it when you feel like it. No pressure.

lol i havent found LIQUID ocelot yet.
Tho i have found NORMAL oceltot at least 30 times,Olga fromt h plant I have found aswell.
Just keep looking is my advice i know there in there.
Tho i dont think Liquid Ocelot is, Liquid ISNT even IN the game at all, other then his arm lol, so that explains y u cant find him then.

> could someone plz upload snakes head 
>
> and is it possible to have the head textures seperate ?
Look through my FAQ (its actually AMAZING how many of you dont), Its made SPECIFICALLY for this games files, itl explain where to find SNAKE, and YES the head is detachable and NO you there isnt a seperate HEAD texture, well except for the Higher Res one.

NEWS!
Since being FIRED from my job I have gained more time to work on this games files.
so PLEASE tell me what you all want me to add to the my FAQ adn il ad it and upload as soon as.
I am not sure what else to put int here anymore actually, so thats why i havent touched it in a while.

Liquid - I wasn't trying to be SPECIFIC and display spoilers for anybody, haha!  Yes ofcourse thats what I meant. What kind of a fan do you think I am?    

You found Olga of the plant and Ocelot? Hmmm.... I keep looking and looking to no avail! You are looking through the D folders right?  I guess I might find them eventually. This is sure annoying! lol

Actually, I may be able to help you add more folders to the FAQ, because for all I know, you could be missing many because you don't have all of them, right?  The problem is I tell you, MANY FOLDERS are just so confusing as to what they are for!  For instance, I found a folder that contains Fatman for that particular cutscene, but it also included the dead guards holding their crotches as seen in one of the unlockable alternative missions!  AND, when I looked in Raiden X's folder, I have no idea why it also included him in his Ninja form, AND in his soldier form which is story mode only!  Combine this with the very odd naming of some of these folders, and I think its quite confusing as to understanding what some of these are meant for.  I mean some of these seem to be rather disorganised, all over the place. Amazing how you can create a game with such file chaos!

Oh yes, there IS a seperate head texture actually, you misunderstood him.  See, if you check off 'subtextures' or whatever, what you need to do to put the textures on the models ANYWAY, they are all seperate textures. the head itself isn't just one texture though. You have to find the textures for: His face, bandanna, 2 different hair textures, eye, and lashes.  So those are ALL seperate but included when you extract ALL the subtextures as well, so you won't use the other ones if you just want his head.  Just find the ones you need then.

Oh and Lionheart, I'm sorry to hear about your job!  Or perhaps, congratulations? lol. Its different for everyones situation.  But yes, look on the bright side and enjoy your freedom for a little while before your next one!

I guess me or the DI could send you soem of the files from the game.
DO you own ANY mgs games for PC?
or are they all on console?

I don't know.....

If you want to use the models for something, you should go and buy a copy of the PC game. Its only like $5 online these days I think.

And you don't have to worry about making it for other games, because I am working on Snake, working on his textures and everything anyway. I might put him for some other games, but I don't think I can. There are no high res textures yet to speak of. the textures on the PC version are the same, if not worse (not sure why) than the PS2 version, so there aren't any high res textures until we make some. And I'm working on it. I'm a perfectionist so I'll make sure he has some perfect textures on.

I also don't think we would be allowed to take the OFFICIAL models and put them anywhere else. I had known about a MGS mod for Jedi Knight 2 that someone made from SCRATCH, but because it encorporated MGS characters and gameplay, someone from Konami came along and asked him to cease production on it.  How mad do you think they would be if they see any of their OFFICIAL models anywhere else?  It's too risky....

Once Snake is completely renewed and remade, I will think about what options I then have. I was thinking it would be great to play him in some shooters. But, you can't just ask for models without the game and for illegal use. It might not be a good idea to put models into other games, because Konami is one of those companies who will catch you and won't be too happy with you.

This Solidus program is of great use to everybody who already owned PC Substance and wanted to have something truely unique about it from the console versions, especially after having put up with all of the graphics errors and other problems.

If you're a huge fan, that's great! But you should buy the PC version, and then you can explore all the models and textures as much as you like.  AND, you will be able to enjoy the game with ENHANCED models and textures, making a brand new MGS2 experience! But  you really have to keep them for PERSONAL use because we have to be quite careful here....

I hope you understand.

Good point.
Tho HE has shown he is a true FAN by owning the PS2 version, which is actually BETTER adn has no graphical issues unlike the PC version.
So i am not sure yet if we have any reason to not give him the files.
Tho if ONLY we had the Solidus source code (no, i asked he said NO) because then we would be ablet o add a SEARCH function to it, so if the PS2 game used the same formats itd be easy to extract them.
Tho i doubt it to be honest.

> ive got them all on console they are my favorite games and i would like snakes head plus the texture for converting into other games so if u could send it to me i would really apreciate it
lol, maybe youl find a use for my snake eater tool if i ever finish it, or actually release it/make progress with it.
YOU CANNOT USE MODELS OR TEXTURES IN ANYTHING ELSE, IF KONAMI OR ANY OF ITS AFFILIATES WERE TO FIND OUT THAT YOU DO NOT OWN TH EPC GAME AND THAT YOU AHVE STOLEN THE MODELS, THERE WOULD BE SOME SERIOUS ISSUES!
Just a warning.
I guess you could be free to MOD them, so that they only make REFERANCE to the MGS2 stuff, that way once its modded itl technically be your own work, tho this is still borderline.

Oh thanks dude.
I was thinking of making my OWN tool for Previewing XTI lol.
Guess i dont need to now eh.
Extended Search Functions? What like search in OTHER archieves for files?
Model viewer would be FANTASTIC.
wondering tho as id imagine it WOULDNT have textures.
Any progress on them Evx files at all dude.
Yeah some models sem to ONLY be in EVX, ie high poly ones or soemthing, I cant remember now, but Dying Informant said it in an erlier post i believe.

Thanks Turfster!

Well, I can't seem to get the preview feature working. How do I use it exactly?  It isn't doing anything for me.   Like, if I open up a .qar file to see some XTI texture choices, viewer doesn't do anything there. And if I open an XTI texture, that would mean I'm already converting the textures before I know whats in it, and still viewer doesn't do anything.

This feature has to go back to the drawing board.     

Thanks though for trying. Maybe next time eh?

This feature has to go back to the drawing board.     
Thanks though for trying. Maybe next time eh?Ha Haaaa
This this is so easy to use.
Simply select the XTI you want and right click Preview and then when you go to thePreview window itl be there.
THATS how it works, also its now possible to use Drag And Drop with the program.
I dont know if this was a Previous feature but its here now And saves us exiting all the time and opening NEW archives everyt 30 seconds.
Also please mayeb try and edit your last post, He is doing this porgram with NO gain from anyone other then US and its for FREE, if we were paying for it then YES we can comment on its features and say "No i dont like that", but seing as we ARE NOT paying for it we cant really say whats not good about it, or he may just simply go "Well WTF can you say abotu it, I dont HAVE to do this you kmow"

Sorry for soundindg so serious btu I recently got asked to join a popular Japanese Fan Subbing group (Fr TV Shows) so i know how it feels when you work on someihng for ages and a person talks to you like they have a RIGHT to get the newest release ect, it piss annoying il say that much.
Tho you are good friend of mine so its not ME you should maybe think of appologizing to.

OMG. Yeah I totally forgot to check the right click. What an idiot eh? *smacks forehead* Sorry about that Turfster. Thanks for the update, and thanks Lionheart for making me look like an idiot - I mean helping. XD. Nah really, thanks for pointing it out.

But I do want to mention here.....

What are you talking about? YOU'RE the one always posting the most going 'any word on this yet?' Even more than I do. I am always the one going 'at your convenience' and 'no rush'.  I totally appreciate this program and every second of time he puts into it, most ESPECIALLY if he's not even a Metal Gear fan ( I don't even know where he stands there), still putting in effort for us because no one else could.  But I do admit I was quick to post in disappointment when I thought his new feature wasn't working at all. 

I'm really sorry about that Turfster. I thought maybe it was a late night for you and you found some time to change the layout of Solidus but forgot to put the code in for new feature, when it was just myself who couldn't remember about the right click menu. Sorry, and thank you as always once again. It's so much appreciated.

Sorry for the misunderstanding everyone! lol *hugs all around*

lol.
Yes i did seem to fly off the handle a bit, I was in a stress cos Me and Ai_Mai completed subbing the 1st episode of Densha (japanese tv) and tis guy was like, "When is the next one, I wanna see it, oh btw, I noticed 10 spelling mistakes in your Subtitles, I ahve listed them here, are you english, if so why the mistakes", i was all like "WTF U FOOL, I AM ENGLISH, I SWEAR TO GOD IF U START IM NOT GONNA RELEASE THE 2ND EPISODE, SHOW SOME CONSIDERATION like the wonderful Katsune, BAKAYAROOOOO". erm.. yeah sorry about that Long post thats rather unrelated.

Oh YAY i got a hug,  (Y do i imagine thats not the correct smily)

Yes all is quiet after my rather random freak out.
I am happy today as I have JUST this second obtained the newest episode of "PS Rashoumon", the episode was only aired on Japanese telievision last night and I already have it, ahhh so good,of course if any of this show gets Liscensed in the Uk then I guess il have to delete my stuff to stay in line with the law, but currently its allll good because its not yet liscensed.

I've been getting some help from people on a russian Metal Gear [site](http://www.metalgear.ru), so expect to see new additional functionality soon.

Anyway, sneak preview of the next build : 


No ETA on the public release, could be tomorrow, could be somewhere in the middle of the week (there's some more stuff I need to fix)

Ahhh Audio.
Actually i found something on converting the PS2 ADCM or whatever it was called yesterday lol.
I have looked into the EVX AND THE CVY fiels a lot recently, But there are obviously differences between each DAR, but i cant actually tell what they are FOR, all i know is that i have found HUNDREDS or maybe a smaller nnumber actually, of CVY files contianing DEAD GUARD FOR SUB.
But thats a common find.
Wonder wahtt hey mean.

Right, new [build](http://metalgear.turfster.be) up, now with bgm.dat extraction. Comments, suggestions, etc welcome as usual.

EDIT : for those of you that got the 1.6 build, get the new 1.6a build. It includes a new libvorbis.dll and writes 4channel ogg files that actually *have* 4 channels, instead of 2 stereo channels and 2 channels of silence

As usual dude great job.
I personally dont think il find MUCH use for this part of the tool BUT the Dying Informant should be over the moon.

After looking at the UVAG extractions I have noticed that MGS3 uses codec seperatly from the rest of the audio (though this IS obvious), but I have YET to rip a section of speach that ahd MUSIC in the background.
So im wondering if this does that because I dont see why they would bother to make say "Snake noooo" speach seperate fromt he slow music in the background, though i dont know much about this games formats so i cant really say myself.

Any news on the OTHER files found within the Archieve, it seems asthough i can LOAD the .SCN files BUT it doesnt matter as it ses it cant find any of the files that it needs and crashes XSI anyways, so im assuming that they used soem sort of Plugin to export to KMY as its not a normal XSI format at all.
THough after looking at the SCN files with a HEX VIEWER it SEEMS like they MAY have been made in a program called "Virtual" something or other (I cant remember right now) after a google search I ofund NOTHING on this program anyways..

Any other things you plan ot add to this tool dude?
As so far it does all the things I want lol, well actually id LIKE to understand them CVY and EVX files, but other then that Im content with the tool thus far.
I believe the Dying Informant has already posted her list of things she would LIKE support of.
hehehe, any chance you could lend ME a hand on the twin snakes topic?
I chaecked out that RUSSIAN forum, but alas i cant read Russian an even when I translated it i found nothing of real interest, well nothing to do with the files anyways, except a guy who was translating the game into russian with a Patch he made.
You can read Russian?

And another small [update](http://metalgear.turfster.be), this time I added the KMY model preview - both wireframe and flatshaded mode. They look kinda shitty due to the degenerate triangles etc, but hey, it's just a preview, right?
Also did some more code cleanups/optimizations. 
Tell me if I broke something 


3D preview window controls are the same as always :
LMB : rotate model
MMB : zoom (increase step factor with slider below the 3D view)
RMB : pan model (slightly)

Thats great dude.
Whats actually LEFT to look at now though?
Oh yeah i remember now, the Animated Models, EVX and CVY, well thats IF they are models lol.
Maybe they oculd also be the Higher Resolution models.

say hello to our friends Otacon 

and Snake


Anyway, these are some teaser images of the current progress on the EVX files. I can pretty much convert all the face dir EVX's to a static model, ignoring the bones,and a few of the simple other ones (Including raiden's hair). Snake's EVX however is another matter, so I'm not releasing the current build to the public just yet.

OH...
There HEEERE!   
Theres BONES in the newer EVX files?
Please DUDE if you cna figure out a way to export the bones ALONG with the OBJ files (I assumed ud export to that, but i have no idea).

So what DO these files contian exactly?
High Resolution Models? Or High Res models with Animations (please god export animations, Il be so happy).

Snakes EVX might be harder, for a few reasons.
- His beard isnt always a texture (simtimes its a sort of model right?)
- The Bandanna moves when he talks (I guess that makes it harder).

Is there any chance of relesing the File information (Headers,identifiers and such, so that the rest of Us can maybe add suport in our tools for XTI files, I of course need it for MGS3 and MGSTTS, but still Itd be nice to understand the models Propperly)

So these files are all from FACE dir EVX files then huh.
Hm... I wonder how hard it would be to move onto the Stage and Demo EVX files.
And what about the CVY files and the SAR ones, I dont expect support for them, but i wonder what they are for at least.

OMG!!!  Turfster, are you sure you don't have background experience as a MAGICIAN?    

Wow, music files and now EVX are coming!

Well to be honest, I don't think I need anything from the BGM folder right now unless it has dialog in it, but I think that's found in VOX.DAT. Still, this is great! I will take a look at whats in there and see if anything is new.

One thing I would wanna do with music actually, the idea is very simple but the process probably is NOT because it would probably require the source code or something. I would take that 'Countdown to disaster' song, and make sure it plays uninterrupted the whole time - where as in the game right now, everytime you step outside, the music stops.  It pretty much takes you out of that "oh crap I better hurry" vibe.  Another thing, ofcourse, maybe someday, would be if I could make my own missions, I would include some new background music to play there (taken from Acid or something).

But no worries! This all comes later or never. but I am very impressed with your work here so far!

Yeah I understand, if you include the bones that could make things alot more complicated for you. I mean maybe bones would work if you had the same 3D program they used, but I don't think thats very convertable to other programs.  That would be AWESOME for me, then I could pose the characters right away and not have to set them up first, but that's ok.  From what I can tell sometimes, MGS2 characters could have used more joints and better deformation in some scenes.  So making a skeleton from scratch is a good idea anyway. Plus, I needed to learn it.  It's very easily actually in Maya, but I still want to edit some of the characters before I rig them.

And there we go, accessing EVX now too!  I am not sure what CVY is, I think in some cases that looked like files that associate textures with the models - new textures that would be placed on that is, like when a guard bleeds.  But sweet! EVX is definitely gonna give us access to more models. I think that should pretty much take care of that whole 'high res hands' for cutscenes dealio.

Thanks so much Turfster! I really really appreciate your time in this.  My hero! lol

Oh and lionheart, Snake doesn't have a model for his beard. its very flatly on his face. They just have the two types of textures: beard and no beard, and then another 2 versions of those for when the camera is farther away.  Yah the bandanna is a seperate piece and moves. I guess that is also why Raiden's hair is a seperate model, because it has to animate in its own way. In MGS3 Snake's hair animates, but only in the cutscenes.

I think all hair and cloth types of things are made into a seperate file. Where as ammo clips and stuff they are part of the main model, even though they bounce up and down.   I knew that EVX must have had something to do with animations, and now I know its true since he mentioned bones. Also, the codec and cutscene characters have facial animation. I wonder what files those might be in? Well, not that we could do anything with that. Probably not.

He he, I thought ud be happy with the release of the music till I remembered you wanted the VOX voices anyways.

NEWSFLASH!
I KNOW WHAT THE 02D FILES ARE FOR!
Explanation: For Menu, Game over and ANYTHING that isnt ACTUALLY ingame THE GAME cannot use 3D models (itd be a waste, not to mention a memory drag)the game uses 02D files, these act much in the same way as a piece of CLEAR paper, you just whack an image on top of it and Walla ur done.
Of course you have to set up several to make a Menu.
Maybe il paste how to make a menu screen in a game.
As i have odne it MANY MANY times in Ruby script

I have a quick Question.
The actual INGAME snake Models are just KMY files right.
And the EVX files are the Higher res onces for A:Close Ups and B: Cutscenes.

But im SURE in the NORMAL Ingame snakes eyes didnt look as bad as in the exported OBJ files.
This MAY be because of the fact that there not rendered Once Exported but its all Rendered Slightly by Direct X(whatever number) during actual gameplay.

THo Turfster you have already said that the EVX files are most likely NON static models.
Meanign that there models with Animations, So WHY if the other models wernt ANIMATED would they be in the game?
I dont remember seeing any STIL snake models anywhere (well actually using action replay on PS2 version YOU CAN get the model of snake ingame as a STATUE, he doesnt move he is just as when he is an OBJ file).

Woah, cool! Wait wait.... You mean we didn't already see these in the texture files? Do you mean you know how to actually create a WORKING menu screen? I thought you had to have access to the script/programming of the game to be able to change any of it. But there were guys previously able to change TEXT in the game. The names of the dogtags to be collected. I assumed this means that the menu screens could be changed too.  If you make a guide, that would be great! Include screenshots too, that always makes it easier to follow along.

This is wonderful you guys! It almost feels like nothing is out of reach in this game, that its just a matter of time for everything to be possible. But don't worry, I won't place THAT much pressure on you guys or anything! I'm just really happy with the progress thus far!

I'm not quite sure what you are referring to here. For one, I think I already told you that there are many models in the game, including Raiden and Snake, that have a higher and lower res models - that is, more polys in one than the other one.  this is particularly noticable in the FACE.  In gameplay for instance, when either Snake or Raiden is farther away from the camera, their head switches to a lower poly head. One which doesn't have round eyes but just slight pits for eyes with a eye texture pasted on top.

So there are two models of Raiden and Snake that you will find, I forget what the differences in the filenames are right now, it was something like Sna_def_sh_st  (I probably got it wrong), but you will notice there are two versions of them.

HOWEVER, even if you find them in the cutscenes folders, they still have low poly hands (not what is shown in most cutscenes), and they don't have teeth, so those specialised models must be in the EVX files.  I'm pretty sure the models don't have any other differences.

If you mean the TEXTURES for the eyes, well, in general I noticed the textures don't look as good as in the game. I'm not quite sure why, but I think the game renders it a certain way.

I hope that helps. Otherwise, maybe Turfster has more answers about that.

Well you dont have to change the programming to replace the 02D files.
It should be able to be done in the same way as replacing ingame textures.
Well ACTUALLY u onl have to REPLACE the textures anyways, because the 02D files are just floating clear sheets of data.
The texture would go on top.
But thinking about it, We did really already know this.
As in the Solidus Tutorial Turfster explained how to replace the main menu texture.
SO its jsut the same as that lol.

I actually ment I understand what they are for, As i never really realised before, though it was kinda obvious.

And in this week's [build](http://metalgear.turfster.be), we bring you :
* (static) EVX to OBJ conversion
No bones yet, but at least all files should convert now
* stage, face and slot.dat file extraction
I've coded up some stuff that *should* allow you to extract files from the above dat files in the PC, PS2 and GC versions of the game. Note that I've only been able to test it on the PC version, and a 2 meg partial of the GC file, but it seems to work as intended. I'd appreciate it if people with the other versions could test it (for the PS2 files, you'll need to check "treat DAT files as PS2 files" in the general section of the options).
Also note that just because the extracted file has a known extension (kmy or xti), it doesn't mean Solidus will be able to convert it - so no, Solidus can't convert the GC files (yet).

YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY  
Il test it on MGS2 and MGS3, Maybe the GC version aswell.

Any chance maybe before the next Solidus release(if there is one) u cud work on them GC files
As i learned that there a different Endian But im currently not good enuf to understand HOW to convert and stuff.
If i have your space or soemthing to upload to il do as many fiels as you need.

Turfster, your work is really fantastic! I'm trying to develop an indie action game, so look into the archives and see all the level geometry and models is really inspiring.
It's incredible to see how simple are the textures, the geometry, the lighting on geometry level is drawn directly on the textures! wow, simple is always better! 
My main hope still, is that we can extract and export the character animations, I mean the in-game animations. Your work on evx files is a great progress on this way. Keep up the good work! 

A note about the evx conversion into OBJ format. I think  there is some problem about vertex order in the OBJ file because the faces are correctly ib place but some of these are turned in the weong direction. I post some screen to let you understand (taken from milkshape but the result is the same also in Deep Exploration).

You're right, that's... odd, since I use the exact same vertex swapping as I use in the KMY converter, and there it works without problems.
I'll look into this.

You're right, that's... odd, since I use the exact same vertex swapping as I use in the KMY converter, and there it works without problems.
I'll look into this.Ahh yes lol.
I remember now what i found out lol.
The problem with the TGA exporter is back lol.
When i export the EVX files the hair has white bits in it, almost a as if it was a collection of paper with lines on it lol.
Also is it just me or do i need to EXPORT the EVX files before I can COnvert them.
The fact that the EVX files do not have the ability to be viewed doest bother me lol.
Yes the Twin Snakes STAGE.DAT works fine, I eported several things from it, Of course the.MY files canot be opened and the .textures files are the same with Solidus.
Il try the NEW VERSION out on MGS2 and MGS3, tho MGS3 i dont expect to work cos STAGE.DAT and most of the dats other then VOX.DAT are all encrypted.
And i cant get past it, was hoping MAYBE you could tryit some day in the future lol.

Wow, I'm really impressed with the progress of this "project".  I've been having some troubles though with Solidus though and I was wondering if one of you guys can clear it up.  Everytime i try to convert a model file(KMY/EVX) into and OBJ file using the option to stick to submesh definitions i get this error:

```
Acess violation at address 0049F44E in module 'Solidus.exe'.  Read address 00000000
```


Any ideas as to what causes this and it I can fix it?

Whoops, my bad, fixed in the [new build](http://metalgear.turfster.be).
Also in the new build :
* faster gamecube data file extraction
* one gamecube texture type decoded (couple more to go)



(don't mind the crappy jpg compression)

Edit : well, decoding isn't 100% correct yet (note the black marks on the left of the snake/otacon picture)

YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEES!!!!!!!!!!!!
HA HAAA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
ONE TEXTURE TYPE? HOw many types are there then?
Hm.. How odd.
Thinking about it, shoulding u change the SOlidus Blog thing from "Mgs2 tool" to soemthing else, As it also does MGS1 dars lol And no GC game aswell, Doesnt do the PS2 anyinth though, but most likely because there all encrypted.

I think  there is some problem about vertex order in the OBJ file because the faces are correctly ib place but some of these are turned in the weong direction..Actually Yes I have noticed that on MSOT of the models at least 1 -6 faces are flipped the incorrect way.
Of course I always fix it myself in the program, though I did notice that the EVX snake was much more flipped then the rest.
---------Sorry for Double POST-----------

I have used the New Solidus on the MGSTTS Texture files(Many actually work, yay).
Though all of the ones Have converted to TGA correctly soem are just ODD looking, Wheras allt he Character Textures are perfect and Object textures also look perfect, It seems to be only the LEVEL textures that are still OFF looking(Well they LOOK like level textures its hard to actually tell).

And another new [build](http://metalgear.turfster.be) up.
This build fixes the decoding errors in the previous GC texturetype and converts 3 more texturetypes, including 2 types of luminance/intensity textures (so yes, the greyscale stuff is supposed to be greyscale =p)

I think I found just about all the texture types the game uses, but if you get a "currently unsupported image type X" message, drop me a line (and preferably, include an example file).


Look ma, no freaky blocks!

Ahhh cool.
Id liek to try my own hadn at this while making my new game engine, I wondered just HOW u managed to edit them CG textures ENUF to work in TGA format in Photohshop.
Me and Strobe managed to replace some data but still the images were screwed as you saw a while back.
Any chance youd be able to Make a list for all the Formats from MGS2 and TTS like how U worked them out, this is next best thing down from Source Code to Solidus(Which I understand you wont ever release), Tihings like what needs to be changed in headers and what part is dimensions and stuff.

Oh btw: I notice that your Solidus tutorial is only for extracting and replacing textures, Would you like me to write a seperate one for Model conversion/extraction and subtextures and Audio ect?
In return for the Info i have requested, If not then Maybe il do this anyways if you want me to as a thanks

Edit:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You said NOtify you of errors
Well its from AREA01 I uploadded that files stuff zipped up for you to look at.
I still get this though

I noticed i have now got 7 RANDOM greyscale Solid Snake images, and 1 of something i cant even tell, WHY are they greyscale exactly? A transpanrency thing maybe?.
Heres the link to the Files, WAs 1 meg too big to attach to my post,(Man Maybe i should ask MrMouse if he could make the Attachments for RAR bigger, Its rather inconveniant to so many peopl sometimes.

Is the mysterious texture some sort of pink/ grayscale with other colours? That are reflection maps/bump maps. Since the GC is better in graphics than PS2, there should be more layers of textures for details like that.

If you mean the stuff I posted then No that seems to be an accident as I can ACTUALLY tell what they are But the colours are really off.
If you mean ones such as the snakes normal costume texture but silver instead an undetailed then Yes i think this is something to do with Reflection or lighting, Its not Alpha im pretty sure of that, UNLESS the alpha was saved separatly that is lol.

Yes, it's a freaky system, no, I didn't design it =p
Also, alpha isn't stored separately, check the files.

Nope.
There is a way to extract MUSIC fromt he MUSIC.DAT
But Sounds nope sorry.
But there easy to get with a program such as Jeader Neub or XA extractors.
Maybe he will add support for these if you ask him, tho the gun sounds in this game are nothing more inpressive then in most others to be honest

New [build](http://metalgear.turfster.be/) up. 
Couple of small fixes here and there + added type 3 decoding.

BTW, I'm pretty sure those "strange" textures in the area files are lightmaps containing (low-res) lumel data, so yes, they're supposed to look like that.

Ahh great dude.
What IS type 3 exactly?
what ARE the files contained in type 3?
You havent BY CHANCE looked into the GC KMY model files at all have you?
If not then i dont want to rush you or anything.
But if so then GREAT.
If onyl Snake Eater wasnt so stupid and have to be ENCRYPTED .DAT files, id send a piece of the .DAT to you to see if you wanted to undertake the challenge lol.
Thanks dude

MGS2 textures formats are most likley TIM2.
But the MGS2 STAGE.DAT is encrypted.
And i CURRENTLY STILL havent gotten it back off my mate.
So i cant check as i only have the MAKING OF disk atm.
Maybe Turfster will add Support for the MGS2 stage.DAT.
but I cant say, ul have to ask him.
Make a CUT PIECE for him and post it here and when he comes he will maybe take a look at it.
Texture with fronts??

Hopefully this doesn't come too late - the "1.000 is not a floating point value" error is perhaps something I can help with - for some people.  I came across this same issue a while while writing some Soldat stuff; it turned out that people with that problem were in Europe, and their version of Windows was set to use the comma as a decimal separator.  If, in your regional setting you have it set up so that, say, "1,000" means "one point zero", when some compilers (notably Delphi/CBuilder) will not convert between the two.  The solution?  Change your region over to US while running the program.

Lol the problem was sorted out anyways.
Just set the "," so that it was CLOSED away.
Not sure HOW it worked but the Problem was fixed.

What/
PC version has resident.dar(in STAGE directory) that include keepfont.row - fonts textures (format like DDS).
Looks like PS2-version used another fonts  And STAGE.DAT has unknown compression...

yes the PS2 Stage.dat is Encrypted lol, Unfortunatly.
So far no1 has been able to get anything from it.
But if oyu have the PC version why would you ever want to extract formt he PS2 version, they are identicle really, Except the PS2 version has the other add on disk The Document of MGS2(with making of, levels, documents, art and such).
Id like to get stuff from here, ESSPECIALLY because it has the SUPER EARLY Solid snake model(shinkawa touch) and Metal Gear Rex, Il put up a Snipped fromt hat and se if Turfster can work with them actually.

 - Stage.dat hold MODELS and textures
 - BGM.dat holds BGM in 4 channels.
 - Demo.dat holds cutscenes made with the game engine~(ie:normal movies, opening is a good example)

- Movie.dat holds the Movies(ie: Flashbacks, REAL VIDEO)

- Vox.dat holds the sound effects used INGAME, soemtimes CODEC and movie aswell.
- Codec.dat Holds the CODEC text.

ingame text like subs. btw, been trying to extract something from ps1 mgs via demo and stage, using nova, i manage to extract 3ds files and generic form file. wonder what could that be and how to view it? 

btw, mgs 3 mpg1 illegal bit stream that i managed to extract via nova, took at least 1gb of file. however i haven`t fully seen the video yet, but it`s quite nice although no sound.

btw, i`m confused in using the UVAG file. can u tell me of how to use it actually. thanx in advance.

if using mfaudio to test the sound files for vox and demo, the file option will reveal compressed but the sound is kinda "fast".

The super fast sound that yous peak of is because the ripper does not know the HERTZ of the sound its ripping so it will attempt to rip it at its default HERTZ.
It would be faster to help you with the UVAG over a program such as MSN messanger, if you have that then please PM me your hotmail adress and il add you right away and help as much as i can.

yes il try that instead then.
I tried ot add you just now and it failed.
Il email you instead explaining UVAG and stuff.
I have not heard anything on Solidus New Build yet, I am not sure if there even IS one.
But we have to wait for Turfster as the man obviously does other stuff, he isnt a MACHINE(as far as i know).
Some one other then me should work on things to help out.
I know the dying informant is out of commision to to getting a NEW PC
Ie:Im doing a Solidus Help file.
Also i made the MGS2 SUBSTANCE PC file Anaylisis guide, Though I do need to update it soon enough.
Maybe you can think of a way to help out so not EVERYTHING is stuck on Turfster.
You dont have to of course, same as i dont have to help out when i can, Just so happens I want to is all.

Well my NEWEST version is here in the forum.
Currently working on a SOLIDUS help file in HTML that should be of some use to everyone I hope.
I havent updated the Guide in a while now but still it serves its purpose well enough.
Please feel free to ask any questions or suggestions regarding the guide, as Im not sure WHAT its actually missing and stuff   
I have attached it to this post anyways, as it seems that you havent looked through the other pages of the topic (Which i recommend you do).
though CURRENTLY it has no .EVX help as thats all done identicle to the .KMY stuff anyways except it looks better lol.
Il add support for these in the HTML version of the FAQ.

First off I would love to say thanks to everyone who made this tool possible for all of us to use. Its quite fun exporting textures and seeing how they used them in game.

Also I have a question. I am wanting to get Snake VR MGS1 model into milkshape. I've looked in a couple resident files trying to find sna_mgs1 but can't locate it. Could someone point me in the right direction?

Thanks,

Finally recieved MGS2SUBSTANCE PS2 back from my friend  .
It doesnt have a BGM.DAT after all lol, though Snakea Eater does and When i load that into Solids it ses the number of Audio Channels is 4 but then ses it cant do it for some Unknown reason.

Also as someone has PREVIOUSLY stated there APPEAR to be some PROBLEMS with the EVX to OBJ converter, MANY of the normals are INCORRECTLY flipped and the HAIR on the snake model has all them WHITE parts that were a problem in the ORIGINAL TGA TEXTURE EXPORTER.
Im not sure if this is the same with .DDS though, as I need to get the MAX .DDS plugin.
Any news by the way dude, On any files I sent'ya or on MGS2 Bones and stuff?
il send the help fil esoona sits 60% done now, as I bin VERY busy lately with Uni.

Have you tried to read the second layer? PS2 Disks have the second layer so hidden you need to make a ISO then use a program to extract second layer data into useable files.

no i never knew that actually.
il make an ISO of it then I guess.
Think Win Image would suffice for that?
Btw for anyone reading this Backing up OWNED games with OWND programs is perfectly legal ok.

Sorry for the delay.
You need to make a ISO image (ISO format exactly), then find a program called Apache 2, with it you should open the iso and look for an option to get the Layer2. With it you can make another iso of the layer2, then you can extract the files.

BTW you should know that the disk is double layered since Windows only reads the first layer, but ISO programs (I used DVD Decrypter I remember) makes ISOs larger than a single layer disk size.

Ah thankyou my friend.
Though I wonder if this would help with MGS2 as not ALL PS2 disks use Hidden Data, Some FFX for example DO hide almost everything but MGS2 itd be a wate to hide BGM.DAT but not hide STAGE.DAT OR VOX.DAT as there the things most likely to be hacked, People will jsut DOWNLOAD the music off th einternet themselves.
But i will make an ISO of MGS3 anyways and see if anything NEW pops up from it, Maybe some Hidden FIles But i really doubt it to be honest as all the files seem to be there anyways.

I made an ISO file of MGS3 and one of MGS2 but it apears that neither of them are DVD9.
So they dont CONTAIN a second HIDDEN layer after all.
Only DVD8 CONTAIN HIDDEN layers.
So I gained nothing at all from Makign an ISO of my MGS2 and 3 PS2 DVDS

YES THEY ARE MINE AND ARE LEGAL.

Well either way I already ahve all the stuff off of the PC verison Of MGS2S so the PS2 version Doesnt really matter tbh, THOUGH there IS a metla Gear REX model in the Document of Mgs2 that I would like to have.
And idea if THIS is double layer or not?

Hum I did not read this thread entirely, but is there a way to extract sounds from VOX.DAT ? I have extracted BGM.DAT thanks a lot to solidus and its maker, but VOX.DAT seems not to be a supported filetype.
I tried Extractor, I don't if there is any other program to extract this file.
Any idea ? Are the SFX sound I'm looking for in another file(s) ?

Indeed VOX.dat contains Sound Effects and such.
Your best bet at the moment it to use Jeader Neub(however you spell it) by Strobe and scan it with UVAG scanner, I got allt he sounds this way, But i dont know a way to convert them to WAV or MP3 at the moment, and I havent really looked into it.
Alos you could try the PSX sound ripper, I forget the name of it, but that will do it i know it does As i used it a few years back.
PSOUND is what its called sorry.

I looked at a few EVX files and they ALL seem to have some CRAZY unflipped normals, Of course its no energy to flip them for me, But others i had to explain it to for days on end.

Here is an example image of what im talking about.
Its Snake.

I can't even deal with the normals problem yet, now that my new Maya is more finicky about .obj than ever before, it doesn't like the fact that these Solidus/MGS2 files contain seperate texture map sections. It only wants to open up SINGLE mesh polygons, not something that acts like multiple objects. I can not comprehend why the newer versions of Maya are like this, nor can I understand why my robot character when turned into .obj, opens up, but is turned into a single MESH, while MGS2 .objs instead won't even OPEN at all, it just REJECTS them. Unless I can somehow get my hands on them ahead of time and convert them to become single mesh, single object.....

Anyway enough of the technobabble here.  Sorry about that.    

Basically what I need to ask is, Turfster, if you wouldn't mind, next time you make a new Solidus upgrade (if you do, and I hope you do   )  I wonder if you could please add a third choice under "conversion mode":  "single mesh only"  and it doesn't seperate the texture maps at all. I don't know if this is possible for you, or worth the trouble. Darn you, Alias!

Well, thanks very much as always for your continued support. Twin Snakes' textures now?!  This gets more and more exciting!      If only I could experiment further...

Of course it does.
But Solidus supports MGS2 TS STAGE.DAT anyways.

i dont see why its so important to Support the PS2 version of MGS2 when it already does the PC version of Substance.
There is no difference.
if anything you could have at least asked for "The Document of MGS2" to be supported as THAT would be a cool feature considering its got rex along with early models and stuff on it, Not to mention UNUSED backgrounds and the HIGH RES Heliport from MGS1.
I swear you have the PC version anyways man?

What...
Why not just do that with the PC version?

What im trying to explain is that the PC verion is upported so havign the PS2 version of the SAME GAME is very unlikely to happen, MAINLY because chipping the PS2 is illegal and I doubt Turfster will want to help support this.
OF course your free to email him and ask i guess.

That version is a month old (see the build stamp, 06/10/06 3:40), it's the last build I did before I went on vacation  
Before you ask, no, I can't really remember what's new in it, probably just some code optimizations and finalisation of the GC texture types, but I'm not sure.
Anyway, I'll probably go start coding again next week somewhere.

Here is an usefull tool: [http://upx.sourceforge.net/](http://upx.sourceforge.net/)

You can decrease with this, the exe size.

But delphi and all the programmign languages allready compress(and normally encrypt) there exe files anyways.
Have you used this on a file before and its made a difference?

Not all. The uncompressed prog.files can edited with ResourceHacker, Exescope..., but the compressed not. (The libvorbis.dll is compressed)

I try out this tool with some .exe/.dll files, and work fine.
Normal Solidus size: ~800k
New/compressed size:  ~300k
(script: upx.exe -9 solidus.exe)

Ok, I know, the 800k is not too big, but if the Solidus size in the future is bigger, than maybe usefull the UPX.

Actually I don't know of any programming language that does this by itself.
Usually these steps have to be added manually so they're executed after the Exe has been compiled.

For a commercial tool I made, with UPX, the Exe size was reduced from 2 MB to about 500kB.

Oh ok then.
Maybe its because every program i make tends to do something little anyways, so it desnt take up much room.
Graphics and shit are waht normally make large EXE fiesl i tihnk right?

But yeah your the 2nd person to mention that the newest solidus seems to export textures wrong.
Me i havent really got the tiem to try it out at the moment.
But everything was workign fine for me a while ago on C.
I sent some guy C and still he had the same problems.
Maybe its your computers settings.
I remember before that regional settings seemed to efffect certain things.
Im sure turfster is fixing this anyways.
Just gotta wait till the next releASE I GUESS.

thanks dude.
Would you mind if i were to ask what your are working on now for Solidus.
Ie: mgs twin snakes, MGS2, MGS3?

I wonder what it was that caused the error in the D solidus then lol.
Just a simple spelling error?

Nothing much at the moment, I'm afraid.
X_Tra is working on the MGS3 decryption. 
I could use some more TTS kmy files to work on, if you want me to do that next.

Yeah sure if you want the  TTS kmy files then il email you some as soon as i can dude.
Yeah i saw the "header decoded" file that got thrown out when i texted mgs3 stage.dat.
in this version of solidus MGS3 BGM.DAT seems to KINDA work, it cant extract or convert unfortunatly though i guess il send you a cut part of the file to check out within the next few hours.

Il also give you the TTS bgm.dat to see if you can get anything out of that, seing as thats the game that the Soundtrack was never released for.

Im nto too bothered about the MGS2 animations but i think that the _D_I might want them.
Also seing as the newer mgs2 .obj files dont work in maya the two of us are thinking of a way around it, she doesnt want to learn Maya scripting and i just dont really have much time recently to give it a go.

So if you could somehow change the .Obj conversion thatd be pretty darn cool dude.

il send you all the giles i can in this topic i guess.
soon as i hope.

Sorry man.
Gone out drinking il post them soon as i can ok.
I dont think the TTS BGM.DAT really matters after all because all the normal music can be taken as its all in seperate files but the BGM.DAT is still there so maybe it contains the music for the Demo scenes form the game.
So mayeb il  post it after all then.

Oh yeah i KNEW i forgot to ask him about soemthing.
But tbh its not exactly ahrd to jsut flip them yourself, though so many people want to use the models but dont understand very much abotu 3D software that it might be handy if Turfster had a look into this little Problem.

yeah the .EVX fiels take much longer to edit indeed.
But blocky? what are u talkign about there man? if your using an unregistered program then normally it only lets you have a model of SO MANY polygons, that might be your problem.

> since i cant find a kmy of solidus
ive got no idea what you mean by this one man?
If your on about the MILKSHAPE .KMY importer then i dont know how often thats updated, but im pretty sure it has been pretty recently aswell.

But unless your on about that then i honestly have no idea.

And yes i emailed turfster and asked him if he knows whats causing the mass unflipped NORMALS on the .evx converted files.

ok then.
As for the SOLIDUS CHARACTER jsut simply look for it, its in the later folders obviously, and also in many of the PLANT DEMO FOLDERS.
best thing to do is go abck a page or 2 and read my guide im sure i put his location in there u know/

Strange.
but then again. Solidus is always a nice model so maybe he doesnt HAVE a kmy u know, because in the scenes where u see him he always is an EVX files and in the FINAL BATTLE he is also higher def aswell if i rmember the files correctly.

Hello all!

Been a long time since I caught up with the latest version of Solidus and whats been happening here.

Anyway, Lionheartuk, I got a question for you. 

I've managed to make iso's of MGS TTS from my GC and streaming it to the PC. But now how do I access the files to get to the textures and models?

Everytime I open the iso with winrar, it says the file is damaged or corrupt. Am I supposed to use some other program to get to the files on the iso?

Thanks!

Keep up the good work Turfster! I was hoping you could also work on Resident Evil 4 when it comes out on the PC! That would be a dream come true! I think RE4 has the best graphics EVER! ...well for the current gen consoles. Either way I'd greatly appreciate it! Thanks Again!

yes Solidus DOESNT support the ISO, only the STAGE.DAT inside it.
Ul need to use a program called erm...  GC TOOL.
U can get it here.
But i dont really want to get into rouble advertising or nothing.
so youd better hurry and get it dude jsut incase it counts as advertising or something 
Thanks!

Short interim update for the current [build](http://metalgear.turfster.be) : 
I polished off most of the problems with the effects code, so now you should be able to extract (most) soundeffects and enemy speech from the SDX files. There are a few files whose timestamps differ from the others that aren't converted correctly, but most of them should work (there's also a *lot* of doubles, but you'll have to find those yourself =p).

Next up on the list are GC KMY files (lionheart sent me some more test files, so I'll see what I can do with those), and I'll take a look at the weird EVX normal problem too.

Great work dude.
Any news on the animations or on MGS3 decryption?
Just wondering if you might need more files to look at is all.
Thanks for your work so far man, has been great.

From Solidus 1.8d, the xti->dds(single) converter is bad. The dds dimensions is bad, like in the older version. I think, the 1.8c is work fine.

Weve all been pretty busy recently but i just thought of it today and decided to ask about see if anytihng was done yet.

REAAAALY cant wait for news regarding the MGS3 STAGE.DAT decryption either.

But i can imagien thats a LONG way from beign able to EXTRACT anything from.

I haven't touched a single line of code since last year due to being overseas and having a total work overload, and I don't see it happening in the near future to be honest, so all current projects (including solidus) are on hold indefinitely. 
MGS3 support wouldn't have been ready anytime soon anyway since as far as I know, we haven't finished figuring out the encryption on the data files yet.

Awwww noooo!

Well, I understand Turfster. I've been busy too. But actually, I was busy with a few things, one of which is a 3D project not currently directly related to Solidus and MGS2, but will be eventually. 

I really appreciate what you've done for us Turfster. You've opened the doors for us for new possibilities and new ways to play around with MGS2 and learn from it.  I really appreciate all the time and hard work you put into this Solidus - you must be an extremely bright and talented man.  I understand if life finds you now too busy, and if as well you lost interest in this. I just hope you will consider coming back to help us more in the future (we are lost without you!). But it also might be cool to let someone else continue your work too.

Thanks for everything, and yes, I really appreciate all those sound files! I still haven't checked it out (my bad), but these are really gonna come in handy for what I have planned.  I appreciate everything you've done, but please come back to us eventually! 

Take care of yourself.

Well PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE try and help me to get these Solidus .obj files to work in Maya. I can not understand or figure out WHAT is the problem here!  Truth is, I need to atleast LOOK AT, if not USE several models of MGS2 for reference to help me with the MGS projects I'm trying to work on now, and this problem is really getting in my way. I've looked at the models with DazStudio and also Hexagon2, and they work there, but see, they aren't very presentable there. It's only in Maya that I know how to fix the messed up UV map and normals, and actually tinker with the models. It's what I know and am comfortable with, and as its an ALIAS format (isn't it?) Maya of all programs should work the best! But I've not had troubles with any other .objs in Maya, just these Solidus ones.... What gives?

Please, if somebody can figure it out, please post or PM me. I need the help with this.... If its something we can actually track down withen the files, perhaps if we ever get a new version of Solidus, the objs can be fixed.

Oh, since I got a new computer recently (FINALLY!) I also reinstalled MGS2 and I have some really weird bugs now!  A quarter of the screen has the effects cropped out in a square shape, and it shows up all over the game, and its plenty distracting, so I can't really let this one slide.... Such a shame!  Wouldn't it perfect if one day, we could use Solidus to correct bugs in the game - make new patches?  Alot of PC players of MGS2 (not many probably play it anymore though), are probably more concerned with having the game LOOK right than to rip apart its innards to be playin with.  

I shall have to seek out my answers as best I can, but there are no guarantees in the PC world.

Now see what I was saying before? A high bed really can be dangerous. Next time, don't spring up so fast just to answer the phone =P  I hope you're alright now.

4 interviews? WHAT? After you left you mean?



Well, back on topic, the obj files I don't understand! Its really a weird problem, it seems like not alot of Maya users get. The search on google I did for the problem led me to the solution of: Try to find a Maya user who can view those files, and turn them into .mb for you.  There was literally no other answer or work around. So I hope you can help, or anyone here? I'm using Maya 7 currently.

I have some pictures to show you what I'm talking about.


So both the .evx and .kmy source models don't work as .obj in Maya7 for me. I try to import it, and I get the Error: Line 1: Index out of range for face creation. Now maybe for the .evx files with their weird normals this may have made sense, but neither do the other files work.

[[img=http://img340.imageshack.us/img340/6590 ... om6.th.jpg]](http://img340.imageshack.us/my.php?image=mayaerrorom6.jpg)


But several examples show up just fine in Hexagon 2. Too bad I don't really know how to use this program at all.  Exporting them as .fbx doesn't work either, or I don't know the compatible settings.  I attempted to re-export as new .obj files, but they still won't work in Maya.

[[img=http://img340.imageshack.us/img340/5818 ... pe1.th.jpg]](http://img340.imageshack.us/my.php?image=hexagonpe1.jpg)


Yet isn't it strange how other objs work just fine in Maya, as shown here.

[[img=http://img340.imageshack.us/img340/6315 ... pg2.th.jpg]](http://img340.imageshack.us/my.php?image=objfilespg2.jpg)

And stranger yet how the MGS files used to work in Maya for me - version 5. It seems there may have been obj glitches or generally pickiness happen from 6.5 onward. That or there is something weird about the MGS files that I can't figure out, but only Maya hates them?  Here you can see I  once used to be able to use these figures in Maya, and the only reason I still can, is because I had saved them to the Maya Binary format. That is only 3 models! I have more I wish to work with that I never saved before.  And I don't want to go back to Maya 5, because I have now version 7 files I've worked on - the program is backwards compatible, not forwards compatible. Your files will only work on the same version or higher.

[[img=http://img340.imageshack.us/img340/4633 ... tc5.th.jpg]](http://img340.imageshack.us/my.php?image=mbfilestc5.jpg)


The problem here too is that I'm a little bit nervous about asking for help with this on Maya forums, because I did this once, and he wanted to see an example of a file. Well, I want to keep this MGS2 hacking really hush-hush, cause you can easily find developers and people on those sites who really have a problem with you modding games that weren't designed for that originally.

If anyone has ANY ideas, please PM me or post here! Really I'd appreciate it!

Well i dont expect anything BACK frmo most of the palces i applied to..
But as for my cuts...
I slept on my arm.. (causing a DEAD ARM) so seing as i have a very high off the floor bed i normally just use my arm to flip me up and out fo bed..
Though.. this time my arm was dead.. so it didnt suppost my weight for very long.. i got to the MAX HEIGHT of my flip.. and my arm gave way(causing me to fall ON MY FACE..).
So right now i got this big cut on the side of my head...(though the way i did it is actually rather funny story)
Right nwo ive got the Dying Informant trying to get me to wear a Bandage lol.

DYINGINFORMANT:

in Maya 6.0 + the .OBJ importer doesnt realy like Groupign so much..
I tend to ahve to import INTO 3D MAX or blender.. then export into maya from there (Via NEW OBJ again lol).
its not raelly so bad..
You should use Blender though as its free and small and pretty damned simple to use.

Ok well, the Blender thing completely didn't work out for me... Luckily I managed to reinstall Maya 5 on a different computer, where I converted the files into MB. Man, I am so GLAD I got it working!  This is the first time I've ever had access to the EVX files, lol. And I had to play around alot with those to fix the normals, but I figured it out I'm sure.... Soon, I will be able to send you an updated FAQ for Solidus.  

Also, soon I'll have to post/show my findings with the troubles of replacing textures. It doesn't necessarily work too well, but I need to look into it some more.

In the meantime, can anybody help me out finding certain things?  I have no idea where to find the weapons, items, or player characters for the story mode.  Well there are items like rations and magazines and stuff.... Where would I find the box for instance?  For the story campain....  I'd really appreciate it.

Nope.
Doesnt have that feature.
That feature was removed from the INTERFACE.. though it may still be in the code.

Ul have to wait for Turfster to reply.
But as far as i know this project seems to be either VERY dormant or just plain DEAD.

Hi all. I'm a MGS fan and I have some to try. Playng Ninja in MGS2 and using NVG we can see:

My wish is play like ninja with close face without use NVG.
Using Solidus I found the kmy files:
...stage/r_vr_b/resident.dar-->rai_nin_face_open.kmy
 
...stage/r_vr_b/resident.dar-->rai_nin_face_close.kmy

When I use Solidus to replace them it send a lot of error messages. "Something went wrong" and all files under the replaced file are "corrupted". Someone has any idea to replace these files? 
My apologize for my english i need improve.

Thanks to Turfster for the genial Solidus. Thanks to lionheartuk for the FAQ. Thanks to TheDyingInformant for the post. And thanks all for read me 

GL & HF

(i only got thanked for the FAQ...not helping decode the MGS TTS files...and sending results to be played about with more).
Anyways.
This is a BIG request...your talking about replacing the game Geometry here...
Or at least editing the scripting to make it sou that it reads a different KMY file...then itd have to read new UV and texture locations
and a whole new TEXTURE map...
Basically speaing Without turfster...i alone cant do this. its too complicated.
I could even work out the animations in the game.

My excuses. It is difficult for me to understand 19 pages in English. Often I do not know about what one is speaking in them. It has not been my intention to devaluate your achievements. 
Thanks now for your help decoding the MGS TTS files and sending results to be played about with more. Thanks for to answer me too.
If replace kmy files is too difficult may be we can do replacing the green texture of NVG by a neutral texture. It will be possible?

It fine lol.
I was joking.
I dont really mind as turfster did most of the work.
Hmm* Perhaps if you can find the NVG's somewhere then you might be able to change the texture in the view..
But im not sure if the game does the colours of the view with a texture...as its just as easy in a game engine to change the screen tint and RGB levels...sou im not 100% sure if this is possble.
But chances are if it IS then itl be a simple case of replacing the texture is all.

I have a question. What is the function of idlist.txt? In ...stage/r_vr_b/idlist I found "5668626
rai_nin_face_open.kmy	=> 0x0077fa05 :  7862789
rai_nin_face_close.kmy	=> 0x003d69b3". But I try change that file with no results in game. Even when I erase all idlist the game continue running. Is then a dummy file? Thanks for your help.

I also have almost no idea what the IDLIST.txt is..I think its the locations of the models/textures in the program itself.
As in like...sou that the developers can find things easier for themselves.
Either that or the file is automatically output when the game is finished..sou that instead of checking over everything...the creators can check over then and see if anything is missing from the output...and maybe if its missing from the output then its missing from the file.
Just an assumption but it does make sense to me at least.

I have been reading through this topic.
I am very interested in what you have here.
I have explored the textures with the solidus program. Very good I must say.

Thanks ^_^.
Its been a long time since someones posted in this topic and the project SOLIDUS seems to be closed.
Everyones too busy to work on it.
I have dissertations, Nadine dissapeared from the face of the earth a dfew months ago, hope she is okei though, and Turfster the main person in this just does other projects and im assuming he is a really busy man these days.
Though i would like if someone was able to continue the work for the MGS games, would like more stuff from the twin snakes and INDEFFINATLY mgs3 and 4...but 4 is a bit too much at the moment and 3...well..we decoded a tiny bit of the header displaying locations but then nothing since then as around that time is when we stopped anyways.

Why let a good topic die?
I have quite a bit of time between college and work, I should be able to work on it. I have used that Solidus program, it seems he spent quite a bit of time on developing that. I guess you need to show him that you have intentions of finishing the project? If you are, count me in. 
Although, I will need to learn quite a lot fast.

Well its not really a matter of interest in the topic its more that turfster might not have time or he just doesnt feel like it anymore, i mean he was working on this for fun afterall kinda so eventually it stops being fun, or perhaps he hit a snag somewhere that made him loose interest in the project.
You can continue on if u like, il help you all i can, but tursfter made the program and only he has the source code and a real understanding on the files.
Not sure what else there is to get out of this game though, animations is all i can think of, and everyone seems to really struggle with animation extraction apparently.

Initially, I'd just like to say a tremendous ''thank you'' to you guys, and what a privilege it is to be here on XeNTaX - how could I have ever lived without?

Having read throughout the thread, I've given it a go but have encountered a number of predicaments with the MGS Tool which aren't addressed here - here I go:

1. Textures. The XTI files won't extract/convert because of the error: TProgressBar property out of range

2. OBJ files missing diffuse maps - whatever these are. I guess relating to textures?

3. I saw somewhere about a FAQ, potentially explaining the location of character models within these archives. Please could someone let me know where to find this?

I'd be immensely appreciative for anyone's help regarding these issues.

PS. Wowzers, am I late to the party?

Scrap my previous post! I sorted those queries. Now I'm back with one more still pertaining to textures:

As opposed to having named textures such as: ''002375696.tga'' I have TGAs with the same name as the KMY/EVX/OBJ files instead. But when importing the OBJ files inside of any 3D application, it asks for the 002375696.tga-type texture files.

So I'm trying to ascertain why this is happening (where are the proper texture files?)

Thanks a bunch.
