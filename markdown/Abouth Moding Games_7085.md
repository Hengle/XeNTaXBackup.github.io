- Post Title: Abouth Moding Games

A this time i only know only 2 Games its posible put models inside, one its Mu Online and the other its Ran Online, bad for me the games are old, the last year y try put inside of GTA IV the Barler of Lineage (3 or 4 Meters heigh) Like a Big Monster of course this with replace system cause of added thinks its a very head pain, i replace one of the bad boys of the game by the Barler, but i fail in something point cause the animations crashed the experiment.

Its good know wath games can be moded, also know in wath games its posible take the 3D models from one game and input in another game, only curiosity.
