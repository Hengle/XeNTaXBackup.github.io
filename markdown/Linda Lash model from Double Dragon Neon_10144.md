to try to make it easier here is the .pak file I have no idea how to open, cant find a tool

here is for linda.pak (I think is the main model and maybe textures)
[http://depositfiles.com/files/kevtoy104](http://depositfiles.com/files/kevtoy104)

this is for linda_p.pak (I think this includes the variants like textures)

Ok, I have been reading the tutorials and aparently the game models are with the format GR2(granny maybe) 

checking with a hex editor(I am using bless in linux)the linda.pak file mention it contains the following namefiles

linda_2.gr2
linda_2_alt.gr2
linda_2_alt2.gr2
lindahead_alt1_emotions.gr2
lindahead_emotions.gr2

and the linda_p.pack mention a big list of .anb files(the names correspond to animations) and a .pfb(fx_linda) file some files seems to be inside directories, couldnt find the textures

someone have some experience extracting files? 

if the files are really in granny format then its not a big problem to obtain the model but I dont know how to extact the grn2 files from the pak

please help
