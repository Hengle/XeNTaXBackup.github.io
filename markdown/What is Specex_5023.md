- Post Title: What is Specex?

While poking around in STO file formats, I encountered texture files labeled as "Default_Specex_Lumi_Alpha."

Now luminosity and alpha I understand, but Specex isn't something I'm familiar with.  Google didn't give me any useful results either.  The file it was referring to is just your average .DDS file.

Does anyone know what "Specex" means in terms of texturing?
