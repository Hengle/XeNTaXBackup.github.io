Hello, i extracted MHGU game files and want to load .mod files and .mrl file with 3dsMax + MT Framework script, sadly the script can't load mrl files, i search a way to convert the file to the file extension .lmt/.tml or load the mrl file with 3dsMax, i saw the file extension .mrl in other Capcom games, anyone knows a way to convert or load these files?

Thanks in Advance
