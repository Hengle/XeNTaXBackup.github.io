Is there currently any working method for unpacking and REPACKING Visionaire engine files?

Tried vis3ext with Deponia The Complete Journey and it works but how can I REPACK files and edited xml?

Please could somebody update BMS scripts? 

Thank you

Did you try to use unpakke for repacking?

And this script [http://aluigi.org/papers/bms/visionaire.bms](http://aluigi.org/papers/bms/visionaire.bms) don't work for you, right?

Yes already tried all that. Thanks anyway 

Guess I could roll back updated game files from Steam and then scripts would work again but I would like to find something that works with updated ones.
