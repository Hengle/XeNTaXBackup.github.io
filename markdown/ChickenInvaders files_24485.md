- Post Title: ChickenInvaders files

I was messing around with the game "Chicken Invaders" and I was able to extract some files of the exe file using the program called "resource_hacker".

here is the links of the files:

In case the .cur or .ico files aren't showing in your pc, I converted them to jpg
