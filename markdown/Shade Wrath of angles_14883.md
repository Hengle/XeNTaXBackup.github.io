Thank you for help!   
The game files is saved in one file. 249 MB it's too big.
I saved it on this page -> [https://uloz.to/!8GxrV4813/data00-res](https://uloz.to/!8GxrV4813/data00-res)

OKay. data0.res is just a ZIP file. However, you must change the first 4 bytes into 50 4b 03 04 (hexadecimal values). Then you can open it with any archiver that supports ZIP, also change the extension .res into .zip

Perhaps you can then mod it, repack it and change back to :
