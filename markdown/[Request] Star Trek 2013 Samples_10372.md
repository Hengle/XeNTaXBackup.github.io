Hahahahaha wow, you guys see the reviews for this game?
I refuse to pay $49.99 for this badly reviewed game lol. Maybe if it comes down to $9.99 I'll get it but until then...
Did anyone buy this game and can send me sample model files?
If so, PM me (or if you can't register here, PM me on sticklove forums).

Thanks!

yes, please, i would definitely like them. if they are extractable i might even pay for a $50 crappy game and get the rest of the files lol.

so, is it really as bad as the reviews say lol?

Sad to tell, but yes, game sucks so bad. As for models, after extraction they have .fbx extension, but they are not in .fbx format   I guess they are compressed or even encrypted, do you need sample textures too or just skel meshes?

looks like it's encrypted, but not compressed. they compress again really well and there is a lot of repetitive data. you can also still see well-defined patterns in the data. doesn't look xor-ish (i don't see the same repetitive pattern through the whole file) so will have to wait till someone else figures it out.

thanks for the samples zaramot, you saved me $50 .

You are welcome   To say truth I bought Star Trek because I thought it could be a normal game and because of models, wanted to lay my hands on them, no luck with that

From what I can tell, the engine is the same as in warframe and the darkness 2.

But in the very least, the game is rippable from.

For a licensed movie game it's quite good. It's definitely a console-first game, though. Supposedly the PC has tons of bugs. Had a great co-op experience on the 360. The only issue there was when I'd play single player -- the AI hero was none too smart.

All in all, well written, great concepts. But I'll admit it needed a few more months in the oven to iron out the remaining issues.

I could confirm that models (and I guess textures) from PC version of Star Trek 2013 are encrypted too.

no new news really, but game does use some kind of byte flipping encryption algorithm (from the names in the EXE) and it uses LZF compression after that. if anyone is good at reversing assembly language i can send you what i think is the assembly routine for the encryption algorithm.
