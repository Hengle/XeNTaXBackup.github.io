This is a FMOD bank file using ogg vorbis as its codec.

[You will find all the tools you'll need for this endeavour here](https://mega.nz/#!QBVRiTrR!MsMEK1sznQyrYfzE9ERrBxm-eKuN-ZX2i0OWPdO10Po)


1. Remove everything before the "FSB5" in the file using a hex editor if you're doing this to just one bank file.

But if you're doing this to multiple bank files, use VGMToolbox's advanced file cutter.


1a. Run VGMToolbox and navigate the following:

VGMToolbox > Misc. Tools > Extraction Tools > Generic > Advanced Cutter/Offset Finder

1b. Select the FSB cutter in the presets window.
1c. Click the "Load" button to load the preset.
1d. Make sure the "Cut to EOF when Terminator Not Found" is ticked at the bottom.

1e. Drag and drop any bank files onto the "Files to Search" box in the top mid-left hand corner of the window.

1f. Move those .fsb files into the 'FSB Splitter' folder.


2. Run the Batch.bat inside the FSB splitter folder to separate the FSBs and then move them into the FSB Audio Extractor folder.
(This step is optional. If you just want the converted files you can skip to step 3)


3. Run the FSB Audio Extractor.bat inside the FSB Audio Extractor folder to convert them into .wav files.


Additional note: They are extracted/converted with the original hash id's so if there's an .xml file that has these hash id's somewhere in the game files you might be able to get the plain-text filenames.
