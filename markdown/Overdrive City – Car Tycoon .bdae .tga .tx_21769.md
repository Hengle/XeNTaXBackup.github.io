Use a hex editor to view the header files.
When the file has a header equal to "PK", use 7-Zip for extracts or rename the file extension to ".zip".
When the file has the header "GCBF", use this [script](http://aluigi.org/bms/gcbf_versus.bms) with Quickbms to extract.
After the files were extracted, rename the file extensions:
The textures for ".ktx" and the models for ".bdae".
The texture can be opened by several programs, such as the Mali Texture Compression Tool, the model is more complicated, Ultimate Unwrap3D can open them, but to save them it is necessary to buy the program.

Hello everyone, I too have been looking for help with extracting cars models from this game. I noticed awhile ago Ultimate Unwrap3D was mention to import the car models, yet the tool didn't support the model format. Same with Mali Texture Compression Tool, I couldn't open the textures with it. Any help would be appreciated

.tga files are not plain .tga files.  They are compressed by GameLoft with GCBF header.  See Quickbms script posted above to decompress them.

Sorry for the little bump, but I have the same question. The textures are tga with GCBF header. I haven't ripped those yet. I got the bdae ripped but it is another bdae.
