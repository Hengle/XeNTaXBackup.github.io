- Post Title: Kingdom Hearts 1 Custom Models

Hey there,

I have been working on a tool to convert the Kingdom Hearts [Final Mix] mdls files into Collada dae files and back to allow for custom models to be imported into the game. I recently posted a couple of videos about it on my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnCA8GH3A7D61W_8TxS6j5w) and just wanted to spread some awareness about it here.

Hope you all have a great day.
