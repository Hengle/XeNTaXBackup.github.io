- Post Title: Damage Incorporated Extraction/Reader Utility?

Okay, I bet no one got this one down yet, despite a 90s production date. Can anyone find a way to open up the .ddo, .dim, and .dmu file from Damage Incorporated game? The other sounds and shapes/sprites I got, but I need to get the other two files.
