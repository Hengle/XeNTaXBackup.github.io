- Post Title: Dragon Ball Z Budokai Tenkaichi 3 using Dolphin ?

So, I've been researching on how to rip Dragon Ball Z Budokai Tenkaichi 3 models in T-Pose using Dolphin
I believe this is possible, as I've seen at least 2 people done it before
Well, actually I've got some of the models, and I'm pretty sure the author used 3dvia Printscreen + Dolphin to rip the models in T-Pose
I tried doing the same, with many different versions of Dolphin, but failed to get them in T-Pose

Would anyone kindly tell me how to do the same thing ? :S

Here is the sample picture I've got from the 2nd person who ripped it


PS : I'm unable to contact the first author, as the forum has been down since long time ago, and I've got no track of him/her.
As for the second author, I believe he was a member here before. I tried contacting him through MSN, but he doesn't give a **** and ignored all my chats.

Too bad the authors wont send you a reply back.
But, most of the authors doesn't give [...] to reply back.

I've tried with GameAssassin before, but it doesn't rip any mesh at all

Is game uploading even tolerated here ?
