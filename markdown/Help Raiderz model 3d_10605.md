Hey, this is my tool ([https://github.com/x1nixmzeng/z3ResEx/](https://github.com/x1nixmzeng/z3ResEx/)) which can only be used to extract the files.

The 3d model format is largely unknown, but there is a Blender import script for some versions here - [http://forum.ragezone.com/f245/elu-ani- ... er-488857/](http://forum.ragezone.com/f245/elu-ani-blender-importer-488857/)
