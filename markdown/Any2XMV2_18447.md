This was a tool/script I whacked together to convert virtually any video file to XMV. It can handle up to 10 videos at a time and is surprisingly fast. It uses a combination of FFMPEG, XBOXADPCM and XMV ENCODER (XDK) to accomplish this. As of yet I havent had a base video format it couldnt convert to XMV and Ive tested WEBM, BIK, SFD, AVI, MP4, MKV, MPEG2, WMV, FMV, TS, VOB

You can see videos of it in action here

If you are converting less than 10 videos it will end with an "error" but this can be ignored. The error is simply caused by it looking for another file to convert and not finding one. Simply ignore it and close the program

Here's a new location for it and several other conversion applications:
