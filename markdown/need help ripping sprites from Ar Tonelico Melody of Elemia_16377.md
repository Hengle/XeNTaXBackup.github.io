- Post Title: need help ripping sprites from Ar Tonelico Melody of Elemia

based from this thread: [viewtopic.php?f=10&t=3510&p=30143](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=3510&p=30143)

hello, i'm new here.

i currently need help for extracting sprite file from game Ar Tonelico, which is mainly from RPK.BIN file. but the bad thing is, almost every tools that needed extract RPK.BIN couldn't be found in internet nowadays (even can't retrieve some of them) like Rpkextract.rb. Only the survived tools is exar2rpk which is from [http://asmodean.reverse.net/pages/exar2.html](http://asmodean.reverse.net/pages/exar2.html), but the downside is it's only work for Ar Tonelico 2. i need help from you if it's possible to ripping this game currently.

Btw, if any of you still had rpkextract.rb (this taken down from internet  ), can you spare this file to me, because i really, really need it for my project.

if anyone want to helping me, I thank to you so much.

Can you upload RPK.BIN file?

I also tried to find this ruby script, but without success, sorry.

here it is: [RPK.BIN](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0ByJM2JTS0bYOVk9Rby1Va2JXcUk)

i know it's impossible to retrieve this kind of file from today's internet (maybe because taken away from online), so that's why i was asking question here.
