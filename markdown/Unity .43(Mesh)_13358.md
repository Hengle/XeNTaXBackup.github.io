- Post Title: Unity .43(Mesh)

Hello!

SO... Is there a tool some where that can get the mesh info from a .43 file I got from a Unity game?
I have searched for a bit but cant seem to find anything!
Thanks for the help.

Thanks for helping out there!

I downloaded Noesis and placed that Plugin, now when I try to open any .43 files it gives me this error:
[http://prntscr.com/8kcgtl](http://prntscr.com/8kcgtl) some times this one [http://prntscr.com/8kchjd](http://prntscr.com/8kchjd)

Is there anything I could be doing wrong?

THANKS!

It probably doesn't support that model file, since there are lots of versions of unity and some versions change the format.

So, is there any way I can get mine unpacked? Is there some one willing to make this for me?
I am able to pay.

Model import just fine for me but they are Flipped because his shift car holder should be on his other hip. also no rigging. Unity3d ver "4.6.5p"
