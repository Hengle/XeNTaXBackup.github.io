- Post Title: Red Dead Redemption .cvd files

Hello everybody.
I am trying to extract the models from Red Dead Redemption, but I can't figure it out yet. 
I know about Noesis with rage_engine.dll but this plugin does not extract sub meshes.
I uploaded some examples, if someone can help, I appreciate.
