- Post Title: Noesis and fpk folders

Hi,i am new in this forum but i was sent here after i was doing a research about noesis by google XD. After i saw by accident that program(noesis) i tried to find psp games so i can import the models in 3ds max. After i downloaded noesis and some games i found an obstacle...there is no fpk files.The only files format that i have after i mount the iso file is .bin files.Can someone explain where arre the fpk files??i might have downloaded the wrong games but i downloaded the ones that i could find....Any suggestions?The games that i tried were dissidia 012 and bleach.
