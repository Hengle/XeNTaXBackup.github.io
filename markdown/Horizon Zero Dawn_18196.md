Hi there!
I'm trying to get the audio files of the Horizon Zero Dawn game for PS4 but I can't find them in the extracted files. Could someone help me with this??

Thank you.

The audio extraction is NOT supported for now, that is why you can not find them anywhere.
Assuming your talking about daemon1's tool.

Rename the .wav files to .at3 and they will play in Foobar with vgmstream.
