- Post Title: .ipu and .ips compression

right, here's the thing, i'm a huge fan of the shin megami tensei series and their spin-offs
so, i tried to rip some of the movies from the ps2 game dvd..normally i have no problem with ripping movies and audio from ps2 games, and any game for that matter, as long as they don't have .dat or .bin files...or .pac or .arc or whatever archive has special directories and such...and even if i find some i can ussualy still rip some stuff with tools like jaeder naub (thanks strobe, you're my hero)
so, on topic, the movie files in the game are compressed, probably...
their extensions are .ips and .ipu
their names also suggest that some of them may be split into parts...
i've uploaded quite a few interesting ones in a rar (163 MB)
i've also uploaded the disassembly log of one of the "single" ips movie files
and i've included the zlibchunk .dat files i got from using jaeder naub..all for your convenience )

here are the links:

edit:
the game also has 2 .dat files one 100mb and one 200mb
it also has an image and a ddt...
i think i also included the ddt file, i can't remember, because i thought it had something to do the time i was archiving the contents...the ddt has probably to do with the .img file in the game

new stuff!

it seems the pcsx2 emulator for the ps2 can play .ipu files with their recent updates, I found this while searching for any additional info:

[http://www.emutalk.net/showthread.php?t=17296](http://www.emutalk.net/showthread.php?t=17296)

the pcsx2 ps2 emulator is open source so if anyone can find out how to open these files from the source code i'd be really grateful  I don't really care about converting them, just watching them is okay, I guess...

the latest source code is here:

Here is an interesting part I saw when hex editing an ips file, the same thing exists both near the end and the beginning of the file:

Also being an SMT fan I have been investigating these formats.  It seems that .IPU is a video format (without sound) and .IPS is a video format (with sound, Sony ADPCM + IPU video).  Since I do not know anything about video content and desired only the sound, I have begun by de-interleaving the sound and video from .IPS files.  Perhaps someone else can provide info on the video end.

About .IPS files:  From the pic in your post or looking at a file in a hex editor, we can see some interesting things:
0x04: Complete IPS file size
0x08: IPS0 magic bytes
0x14: Frequency of audio
0x28: APCM magic bytes (same as used in the .ADB files found elsewhere in the .DDT/.IMG archive)
0x34: Interleave of audio file? (possible)

So, not very helpful on extracting, but helpful for playback.  

Extraction Strategy: Checking out the file we can see that the data is broken into 0x1000 byte chunks.  Unfortunately, there is not a pattern to these chunks except that some are audio and some are video.  The "chunking" also seems to begin with some audio chunks followed by a video chunk (identified by the "ipum" magic bytes for IPU video, often at 0x5800).  The video data appears more "dense" to my eye.  Looking at the audio chunks reveals that for every 16 byte strip, byte 1 (in a zero based array) contains the value 00.  So the strategy is to look for a number of these 16 byte strips in a row that begin a multiple of 0x1000 bytes from the "ipum" magic bytes marker.  After some experimentation I found that finding 10 of these special rows consecutively seems to work, I had one case where only 5 gave a false positive.  We then just pre-pend the APCM header content found before the "ipum" magic bytes to our data.

Listening and Enjoying: To listen to the extracted audio, you'll need the [vgmstream](http://sourceforge.net/projects/vgmstream) winamp plugin.  You'll also need to add some headers to the extracted files using the [Generic Header Creator for vmgstream](http://manakoat.chapso.de/generic-header-s411952.html).  You can find the needed values for your header from the offsets above.  The only missing one will be channels, and I have found that these files are always 2 channels and have an interleave of 256 (0x100).  For header skip, you'll want to count the number of bytes that will get you to the row of zeroes before the first chunk of audio data begins.  I have found that 2016 and 4064 are common values here.  The File Format would be "0x00 PlayStation 4-bit ADPCM".   And just click "Use File End" for your loop point, since these are movies and don't loop.

Attachments:  I have attached my extractor (with source), some GENH headers (premade for use with vgmstream), and a batch file to extract and combine the output with the headers to make it listenable.  The batch and headers are premade for use with the Nocturne Maniacs Chronicle Edition IPS movies.  They will probably work with the US Nocturne movies too, but I cannot confirm that.  If not, you can look at the batch file and see how to call the extractor and toy around with the Generic Header Creator using the info I provided above to make your own files.  Just extract the zip to a folder with your IPS movies in it and run the batch file.

Using my source code, someone can probably modify it a little to extract the movie chunks as well, but I don't know what it would take to play them.

hey thanks for replying, i had kinda given up on this topic, there being an audio extractor at least is a step forward, i got annoyed when i couldn't find a tool to work with these files, so thanks

Hey guys. I've found a very rudimentary IPU converter floating round the internet. Only problem being that it does so in a tiled pattern, leaving the video hardly recognisable. Just thought maybe someone on here might know how to tweak it. Anyway the app is below.
