- Post Title: [REQUEST] Tool to edit .mes-files of DQM J3 (Nintendo 3DS)

Hey Guys,

today I checked the files of [Dragon Quest Monsters Joker 3](http://gematsu.com/2016/03/13-minutes-dragon-quest-monsters-joker-3-gameplay) for the Nintendo 3DS.

I'm able to edit the scripts completely (uncompiled squirrel scripts) but I want to translate it together with some friends of mine.

So I checked the .mes-files of the game. This files are... simple... They should be easy to edit. 
Editing the files with a Hex-Editor is kinda annoying because I've to add/remove bytes + Modify all pointers after edit.
I really need a tool which is able to edit this files and which modifies the pointers directly while editing the text.

I've uploaded a few of this .mes files.

Hopefully someone could help by providing a simple editor.

Thank you!


Here's a example file where I found the pointers for every string:

Editing Files works great with this tool (translating text + modify pointers)! 
Thank you a lot!

Will try the modified files ingame when I'm able to.

@WRS would it be possible to add a "Search"-Function to this tool?
A Function to ADD new strings would be awesome, too!
I'm able to edit the scripts completely so I'm able to add new stuff to the game.
[Editable Scripts, yey!](http://abload.de/img/scripts3tues.jpg)

Would be awesome!


BTW, here are some translation tests
