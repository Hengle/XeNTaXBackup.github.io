Hi.
Sorry for the necrobump, but I've been working on those WADs (Harry Potter and Croc 2 atm) for several months now.
I have written scripts and a documentation on textures, models, animations & audio.
Here's the URL of the repo : [https://github.com/OverSurge/PS1-BRender-Reverse](https://github.com/OverSurge/PS1-BRender-Reverse) ([https://github.com/OverSurge/PS1-BRender-Assets](https://github.com/OverSurge/PS1-BRender-Assets) for the extracted assets)
