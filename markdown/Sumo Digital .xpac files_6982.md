- Post Title: Sumo Digital .xpac files

Okay...so I've come to find that a lot of Sumo Digital titles have these .xpac files. They appear to contain a lot of the game's data. I haven't found anyone who's managed to extract all of the files they contain. I saw a post on here regarding Virtua Tennis 2009, and the files from Sonic & SEGA All Stars Racing use .xpac. I would upload a file, but it's late and uploading would take awhile. Smallest .xpac I have is 151 megs. I'm hoping someone here can offer some help with getting into them. Thanks in advance for any offered help.
