- Post Title: help with PS3 swizzled DDS 2d texture

I've extracted several dds images from a .phyre file. The dimension, DDS type and indication if the image is swizzled are not is on the phyre file and just ripped the image and added the recreated the dds header. Most images that is not flagged as a swizzled textures are just fine but some images are like just static or scrambled or from what I've googled swizzled is there any script to rearrange them to viewable/editable images?

I usually encounter a few of this on other games as well.
