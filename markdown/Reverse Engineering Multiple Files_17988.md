- Post Title: Reverse Engineering Multiple Files

Hello everyone, I am trying to figure out how YGO: Legacy of the Duelist links all of it's card files together, I've managed to make some progress on figuing out how the game works, but I am a bit lost on how it links the cards.

The IDA dump of the function I think loading them is here: [https://pastebin.com/Vcs1nBZw](https://pastebin.com/Vcs1nBZw)

The files are here: [http://www.filedropper.com/xen](http://www.filedropper.com/xen)

Could someone explain how it's linking all of them or if you need more information, I can't seem to find anything, I've renamed some variables in my IDA dump to make sure I remember what they all do so hopefully they help.
