i noticed most of the audio was xored with a very easy to spot xor key. i think the other files are xored also but i did not look to much into it. if you want to research the models and other things i recomend using a jtag 360 and dumping the memory of the modles you want.

you mean the most recommended way to go is to search stuff from a X360 disc?
PAL or NTSC?

no I mean if you want a model you dump the xbox 360's ram while th emodel is loaded in the actual game.
this will give you the un encrypted model and texture file.

if you have MGS HD Collect PS3 version, you can extract the resources with PSARC.EXE.
The [models](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=9106) and textures of MGS2 / MGS3  seem to have the same format, while MGS Special Walker keeps the same file system on PSP.

possibly because it requires a Microsoft framework?

As was mentioned before, you can extract some files using psarc, it seems from it you can get cmdl model files along with textures, there's no way currently to read these cdml files though.
