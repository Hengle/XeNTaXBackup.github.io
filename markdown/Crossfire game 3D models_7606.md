- Post Title: Crossfire game 3D models

Hi.
I need help extracting models. I want to use them in my clips or movies. The easiest way to do it would be program called 3D Ripper DX. But the problem is that I must have a bypass for the anti-cheat called x-trap (if anyone would have   ).
It can be also done by extracting models using Hex Editor. I got extracted a couple of WEAPON models. But I can't find the data of character models which are most important for me. It's way to complicated. If anyone would help extracting the models from ".REZ" files I would be thankful.

Well, in order to extract the rez files you can use hex editor and macro recorder (google it). Whit the editor you can make the actions for  1 ltb... whith the recorder you can repeat the action as many time you need in oredr to extract the models. In the englishversion the player models are in the first 25 -30 ltb files you extract from the game. 
There's however another way to get the models extracted from the rez archives...

(well, i that extractor isnot working, but i have pointed what you need to do in order to make itwork)

about the textures onthesame forum there's a tool for extracting them, and about the ltb files.. there's a tool ltb2x. 
I can tell you about a program that could be used for better editing the outcame x files.. but still, I think you allready might know it.
