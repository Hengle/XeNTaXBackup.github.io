Hello All,

Thought id start this as not much has changed since Shift 1. The .bff format is the same as shift 1 so QuickBMS and the Shift 1 .BFF script is the way to go. There is a post on zmodeler for Oleg for the model files and do somewhat import into zmodeler already, including materials; So I do think Shift 2 will be modifiable within couple of days or at least hope so.

[](http://img641.imageshack.us/img641/9797/31211498.jpg)

Does anyone know if this game can be run unpacked? I don't exactly know where to start, I made a small batch file just like shift 1 but there is a few new more files. I couldn't find the original creator for the Shift 1 unpacked batch file so I am not sure if they written every file down or did they get a program to copy the names.

Sample: (Porsche 918 .bff Extracted)
[http://www.gamefront.com/files/20169182/Porsche_918.rar](http://www.gamefront.com/files/20169182/Porsche_918.rar)

If anyone needs another file or something to figure it out, sure. In the mean time I will be seeing what I can do.

Tested with -loose Commandline like for Shift 1 ?

( shift2.exe -loose ) or whatever the name of the Shift 2 executable is. 

Even it is in German you can clearly see what it is

Unpacking is easy I managed to make a batch file that extracts all .bff files, however the game refused to load once the "-loose" option is put on. 

I do thank Jdoug and Action over at NoGripRacing forums for the tips and also progress they are also doing.   

This is my batch file >>> [http://www.gamefront.com/files/20170313 ... Shift2.rar](http://www.gamefront.com/files/20170313/game_unpackShift2.rar)<<< Extraction requires the same as Shift 1 extracting.  You need QuickBMS *Latest* and NFSShift.bms script put all and my batch file in the main directory and it should start.   

There must be something else blocking it.

Further research turns out CRC errors can occur if you have a out dated QuickBMS. So Shift 1 .BFF script does work however running the game with "-loose" fails to either read or find the files.  I ain't a .exe or pro coder so I couldn't tell. 

Its just a big confusion at the moment.
------

Here is my updated batch. This fixed the problem skipping vehicle files and tracks also few other folders.

[http://www.gamefront.com/files/20170313 ... Shift2.rar](http://www.gamefront.com/files/20170313/game_unpackShift2.rar)

Make sure you have the newest QuickBMS otherwise CRC errors will happen.

So how did you achive that?  Did you create a new way to extract correctly .BFF or are you developing a new tool to do it right?

Nice to see some progress guys.
I'll definitely be watching this thread.
I'd love to get my hands on fixing up some of their models to a bit higher resolution.

EDIT: It seems the import filter for ZModeler was released. Does anyone know where it can be downloaded?

here is a first release of both the scripts:
import car or track!
please read the top of the script for know bugs/limitations!
car script is not totally complete yet, it doesn't import all cars, will be working on it.

have fun using them, and always remember, the models are property of EA games 

many thanks to chipicao for helping in the long research of the files!

It seems that it should bring up a folder selection prompt window when the script is run.
I'm currently running 3ds Max 2011 x64 - When I run the script nothing seems to happen.
Am I doing something wrong?

EDIT: I even, in futility, manually changed the J:\etc file path that was within the script to my personal one, but to no avail.

Did you evaluate a few times before you ran the script?

Open the script listener (F11) and show us what errors you get.

I ran the script (tried both the car and the track) within the MAXScript Listener, but with no luck.
It just remains completely blank as if the script was empty.
There's no sign of any initialization.

If I open the script in the editor itself, highlight everything, and hit enter, the Listener does show a bit of population.

Great tool, Thanks 

Works well for me, on Max 2011 x64 bit. Only issue is some parts appear doubled but with no mesh. Anyway no biggy at all.

One request though, could you make it import the meshes from the cockpit .bml too please

Follow the tutorial for installing a maxscript for TDU as posted above, make sure to hit ctrl E about 4 times, I was getting same errors until I done this, I hit Ctrl E 4 times and then it imported fine (Pagani C9).

Script working fine here. Everyone you just gotta make sure you choose the right folder to import.

I suspect those empty meshes are deformers for damage etc.

What folder are you recommending?
Every folder I've tried has given the same error.

Please everyone, before posting the same problems repeatedly please read everything i write in my posts, i said it won't work on all cars, it won't import all objects from tracks. and since maxscript is really slow and bad sometimes, i'm planning on a 3rd party software tool to convert any car to obj, which can be imported to ANY 3d editing software. it's going well till now, and works on all cars. you'll have it in a few days when it's mostly done. just be patient and remember it's still test season 

Edit: No, i don't plan to sell it like zmodeler,
        and no, it won't to export back to shift 2 i don't have much time to look into the full details of the game files

Sorry for the very long absence, i've been too busy with work and other things in life that really slowed down the development of the tool! i wanted to post some shots of it but the attachments weren't working...

anyway, good news is i want to put more effort in it, so there's already an obj export function, and now trying to handle hierarchy and changing textures/materials, also export to .X format that supports it, then i added support for TDU2 cars/meshes import, with automatic 2db->dds texture conversion, as soon as something is completely ready i'll post it! there might also be plans for importing pssg files from DIRT 2 and 3, but i'll see if i have more time for that.

i'm developing this along with chipicao who's testing it and helped a lot, he's free to share any kind of screenshot he likes on any forum
