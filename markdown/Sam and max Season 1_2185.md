The VOX and AUD files are Speex and Ogg Vorbis files with a special header, just like in Bone and other Telltale games.

The ogg's in the aud files can be ripped straight out with any ripping program or [Telltale Music Extractor](http://quick.mixnmojo.com/software#telltalemusic) (just a 128 byte header from memory).

The speex data in the vox files isnt in an ogg container though, so needs putting in one to play them back/dump them. I'd be very interested if anyone knows a means of playing back/converting raw speex without an ogg container.

It took a while, but I finally sorted it:

[Telltale Speech Extractor.](http://quick.mixnmojo.com/quick-and-easy-week-day-3-telltale-speech-extractor)

I'll post the specs for the VOX format in the Wiki soon.
