Hello Com, 

I've been playing Age of Wulin downloaded and can open the models with "xmod" file. But the gm2 files not. My question is, if someone is an importer for 3ds max XX gm2, xmod and the animation has. The animation is very important. 
Sorry for my bad English. 

Greetings
Meister Keule 



EDIT: Please i need a plugin for Noessis ( xskt -> Animationfiles from Age of Wulin). And the gm2 Plugin dont work!  Please i need HELP!
