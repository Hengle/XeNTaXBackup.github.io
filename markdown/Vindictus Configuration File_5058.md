- Post Title: Vindictus Configuration File

Attached is the config file for Vindictus, (config.cfg).
The game is based on a modified Source engine.
This file is somehow obfuscated.

Any help converting it to plain-text, and possibly even back after making any modifications to it?

I'd like to see if it's possible to tweak some of the game's settings that aren't in the interface.

Thanks.
