Hi, im new.. Im searching operator model from wf and I know that you can freely access the head model. But i thinking, some have a model to basic operator body?. If it does not exist, what program and tutorial can I use to extract it?. I just need that. If nobody has it, i need help with the programs and tutorials to extract it. Thx

I made a maxscript for this game long ago, but you know warframe is updating very often. Last time I made script - client even was without "war within" lol So, obliviously there was no operators there, but there's a tool for evolution engine .cache files. you could extract files with it [blog/?p=1081](http://forum.xentax.com/blog/?p=1081). After that someone should make tool or update at least my script, and here you could find something for warframe .png textures (which aren't .png file lol), or grab them with NinjaRipper
