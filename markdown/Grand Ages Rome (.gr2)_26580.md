I was a bit curious so downloaded the demo and installed.
Used hpk extractor to get the files from Assets.hpk
A quick look tells me all are compressed with Oodle2 compression.
May do an 010 script to scan them all to verify that. They also seem to use only 2 Sections where many GR2 files use 8.
There's 010 Scripts posted in the SWTOR treads that can be adapted for that. I deleted most of that stuff years ago!

As to decompressing them? One could get the basic code from Epic since they bought Rad Games and the Oodle source code is available that way.
Not sure how they allow you to get that source code from Github. Don't really care.

If you want a very basic exporter? I can provide that.

So just for giggles? I did some work and got the GR2 files to extract with Jayn23's exporter.
There is a flaw in his script that looks for more sections then a given file might have.
He could add a resection file call as a simple work around.

Here's a quick and dirty exporter for the 3D meshes.

This was written years ago! And so far as I know? It will work with most GR2 files.
I'm not saying it will give you proper textures names and will not extract the AO UV information.

You may need to edit the mtl file and flip the texture file on the vertical plane.
Some Games are weird that way.

05SpeedMaster, Thank you so much!

Excuse me, is it difficult to write a script that also extracts unit animations?

I'll have to go through my backup drives to see if I still have something that will work.
Most of the code I had for the GR2 format was lost years ago.

EDIT:
Think I found something that will work but I'll need to run some tests first.

OK. Test works.
This preview is with Noesis and Jayn23's plug in for GR2 files
