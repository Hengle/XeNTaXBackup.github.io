- Post Title: Lego Ninjago: Shadow of Ronin files?

(i posted this is the wrong place so ima copy and paste it here sorry) Im not sure how to go about this, im trying to get the rigged models from the lego ninjago moble game and im struggling with converting and what files need to be converted. I found .fib files but it seems those are audio files from some posts here, there are 22-LFH.dat and 23-NAM.dat files but there all less then 100 bytes exept 2. There is a few .glprog files but i have no clue what to do with those. Oh I sould mention that this game is a apk moble game for android.||| I found the glprog files there all named  somthin like this "0a81044012000040.glprog" and they are the right file size to be the models. But im not sure what to do with them.
