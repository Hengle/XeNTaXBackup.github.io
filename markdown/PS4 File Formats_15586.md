So since now we can extract files from PS4 as they did from PT, is there a way online or something on how the procedure is done?
even if it involves buying a new PS4 or anything but is there anything online on how it's done!?

Only PT, Fifa 14, PS4 VR Playroom and Driveclub are available to analize, all other games still encrypted.

For decrypt games you need a ps4 sdk console.

the game also needs to be < 3.7 firmware and has to already be downloaded to your sdk console.
