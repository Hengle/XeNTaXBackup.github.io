Can you upload example IGB and TGA files? 

And can you post a link to the "Alchemy Finalizer" program?

Well, it seems that it is not the first topic about IGB files on the internet. 
I did a little research and some modding communities already exist, people were able to replace textures in IGB files.
There are some tutorials already, please try them first, maybe one of mentioned methods will work for you.
I have also prepared a wiki page for this format [http://wiki.xentax.com/index.php/Alchemy_IGB](http://wiki.xentax.com/index.php/Alchemy_IGB)
It is complicated format with nested objects, so more research is needed on this.


And here are the tutorials and other important topics I was talking about:
