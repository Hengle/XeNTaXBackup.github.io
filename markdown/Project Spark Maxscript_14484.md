- Post Title: Project Spark Maxscript

The script is somewhat incomplete. Meshes and bones with no parents import only. I don't think I'll be able to complete this so I figure I'll share what I have now and maybe someone in the future will help and solve these issues. I have some example files linked for those who don't want to download the game.
