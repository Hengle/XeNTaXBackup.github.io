- Post Title: [PS2] SOCOM Combined Assault PSS File Editor

Hello, i got a gamerip of SOCOM CA from a website and it included cutscene (PSS) music without the other sounds, I was wondering how would i edit a PSS file to only extract or obtain the music and not the sounds, heres the file I want the music from. I want the other cutscene music files as well, perhaps someone could show me how? [https://ufile.io/zxtxv](https://ufile.io/zxtxv)
