FYI the alpha that is on said torrent site only has 3 or 4 cas files while the alpha had 7 to 8 cas files so you aren't getting everything you want out of it.

Also what version of python do i need to run Frankelstner script?

I see nothing wrong with this many games during alpha and betas get their files cracked opened and people release the content so what makes this game any different.

Battlefield Hardline was available before official release, and people absolutely tore it apart with no fuss. 

Same with World of Warships. Same with many other games. Why all the hullabaloo now?

Battlefield Hardline, World of Warships, The Crew, are all AAA commercial games that were ripped open and spread around [on this very forum](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=12567) before official release, and nobody said a word.

I'm just saying, it makes no sense to kick up such a fuss about this game in particular when this exact scenario has already happened many many times.
