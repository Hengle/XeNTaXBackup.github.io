- Post Title: Leaue Of Legends Model/Animation Problems

I noticed the for far latest tool taken from this thread:[viewtopic.php?f=16&t=8630](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=8630)
Still can't export certain character models without breaking some parts of a few animations.
I initially posted about it in the original thread but I just noticed that doesn't bump it here, so I thought I'd post it again:

> Oh man I hope this thread isn't too dead yet, but I still have the problem with the seperate animations. I can specify it this time, though:

> That happens with every champion that has a certain way of animation: If you look at the animations it is made that they are 2 seperate ones. One is just the champion in basically t-pose with only the axes moving and they are spinning, and the other one is just his idle. I presume the game somehow overlays them to make it look smother so that his hand moves without his entire body pose resetting.

> I really hope theres a fix for this since it makes modding for some champions completely impossible, I would greatly appreciate it if anyone was able to figure it out!
