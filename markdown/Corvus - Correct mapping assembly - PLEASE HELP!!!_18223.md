- Post Title: Corvus - Correct mapping assembly - PLEASE HELP!!!

Hey all... Does anyone know how to assemble correctly the maps they used for the Imperial Corvus Raider in SWBF2?? So far it's flying over heads at  FacePunch, so I thought i might ask you guys!?... Its seems they have taken it up a notch at EA in terms of their texturing pipeline... Not your typical UVunwrap wham bam thankyou maam!?

Please anyone!!! I have the files to give for anyone who is willing to give it crack!!!
