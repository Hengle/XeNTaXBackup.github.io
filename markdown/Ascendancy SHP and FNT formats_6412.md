- Post Title: Ascendancy SHP and FNT formats

Hello,

I just registered on this forum and I'm hoping to contribute a bit.
I'd like to start with the SHP and FNT formats of the Ascendancy game by The Logic Factory.
I see that the wiki is still linking to an old webpage of mine for those formats. The server the links point to hasn't been on for quite a while and while I'd like to get it up and running again, it might not be reliable enough to host that information without it being hosted somewhere else as well.
I still have the pages the links point to and I don't mind them being added to the wiki directly.
How should I go about having the information added?
