Where can I find a Nintendo Gamecube sealed? Where can I find a new/sealed Nintendo Gamecube? Nintendo gamecubes are hard to find lately. And so are the games. I have checked ebay and amazon and I haven't found a sealed Gamecube. I don't want to buy the Gamecube used because used systems turn out not to work properly. Also please don't mention Craigslist because I don't trust the site. Thank you.
