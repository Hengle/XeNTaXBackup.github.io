Hi,
Anyone has any idea how to read and edit this kind of file (attached)? This is from a .cpk archive file named "mtzkn_pt.cpk" which contains character bios. I'm sure of it because I used process monitor and the game accesses this particular .cpk file when loading a character bio. 
I guess it's a text file because when you read the memory after starting the game, you can edit the text in memory.
My goal is to edit some of the character bios and repack "mtzkn_pt.cpk".
Thanks
