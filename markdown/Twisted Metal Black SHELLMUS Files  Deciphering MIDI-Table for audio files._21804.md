- Post Title: Twisted Metal: Black SHELLMUS Files | Deciphering MIDI-Table for audio files.

Could anybody here please help me out with the audio tracks that I have extracted the SHELLMUS.BNK file, I need to know where to find the MIDI-Table to decipher how the audio files are played out. Or do you have to make up a MIDI-Table of your own.

Here's a download link for the folder containing the SHELLMUS files, already extracted:

[https://drive.google.com/open?id=19HGd5 ... VaybyKsZzd](https://drive.google.com/open?id=19HGd5BP75-di1WCCVLJqbpVaybyKsZzd) (May have to copy and paste link in google search)

I really need your full support here with this topic please.

Please, could anybody just help me out here! 

All I'm wanting is to figure out how to convert the SHELLMUS.BNK file to play out the main menu theme for Twisted Metal: Black. What MIDI table/file do I have to make, what do I have to do in VGMToolbox to make the .BNK file play out correctly? Could anybody just please help me out here!?!?
