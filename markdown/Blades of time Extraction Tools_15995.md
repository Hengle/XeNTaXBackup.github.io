(I won't care for models where solutions already exist, sorry.)

Hi Shakotay

The blender script which you had provided me is not working on some model files of Blades of Time.

I am sending those model files as a sample  [http://www102.zippyshare.com/v/MauJe8oS/file.html](http://www102.zippyshare.com/v/MauJe8oS/file.html)

Please update the blender script.

Thanks in Advance

Paps.

Hi Paps,
I'm not the author of the script, Szkaradek123 is.
Also python is not my preferred language (in fact I really hate it  ) so I can't help to patch this complex script, sorry.
