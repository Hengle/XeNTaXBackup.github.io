I just looked at [http://wiki.xentax.com/index.php?title=SCAR](http://wiki.xentax.com/index.php?title=SCAR) and made a little script. I cannot guarantee that it's working.

```
Get FILENUM Long 0 ;
Get DIRX Long 0 ;
GoTo DIRX 0 ;
For F = 1 To FILENUM ;
Get FNLN Long 0 ;
GetDString TEMP FNLN 0 ;
Get FOFFSET Long 0 ;
Get FSIZE Long 0 ;
SavePos TEMP 0 ;
Math TEMP += 13 ;
GoTo TEMP 0 ;
Log FOO FOFFSET FSIZE 0 0 ;
Next F ;
```


Either compile the BMS yourself, or use the attached one.

I have released the tool for extracting (and consequently decompressing) the files from any MIX archive which is compatible with both the old and new file format:
