- Post Title: Need help with Sandlot Games .pak files

I'm trying to extract these archives with QuickBMS, but realized that they don't work with the existing pak scripts for other Sandlot games as they use a different compression header? I think. 

I'm trying to extract the assets from Tradewinds Caravans and Odyssey.

Here are the links:
[https://www.mediafire.com/file/f3uezf4b ... n.pak/file](https://www.mediafire.com/file/f3uezf4b6wpvbxc/caravans-main.pak/file)
[https://www.mediafire.com/file/ye8wszuf ... n.pak/file](https://www.mediafire.com/file/ye8wszufr1ahkoh/odyssey-main.pak/file)

They are over 100MB.

wanted to check if the people who downloaded had a chance to see how it's composed.
