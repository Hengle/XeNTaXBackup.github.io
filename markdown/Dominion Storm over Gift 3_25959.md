The following zip contains a bunch of image files. I do not know the target bpp format, nor the used compression. But its likely to be an indexed color format.

The header of the files is as follows:

```
uint height;
uint flags;
uint offsetX;
uint offsetY;
uint id;

```


The flags can either be 0 or 128. Its no problem to read the 128 images, so i have omitted them here.
All images however with the flag set to 0, i have literaly no idea, see attached zip file. Any help would be appreciated

There is no zip file attached to your post. Can you upload it again?
