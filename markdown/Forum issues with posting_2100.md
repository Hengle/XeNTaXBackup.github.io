Yes apparently the errors were going all the way through yesterday.
We were able to POST successfully, but we get this odd error about wrong word or something.
Then if we went back to that topic our post would be there, PM worked PERFECTLY as a few of us used them to commonicate instead, the main tihng that didnt work was File Attachements.
THough it all seems to be soted out now.
