I know i have ripped sounds and stuff from SH3/SH4 and RE4....
and i dont think it was too advanced  
(all sounds from SH3 should be in both WAVE and ADX format,
and hopefully totally rippable with Jaeder Naub),
i did however only test jaeder on the PC Version!! 

but i have to check when i get back home, im currently
in a place with no direct game support and/or analyzing tools

Since Strobe never told me about what he found out( I can understand though,dude) I tried to rip all games via Psound.

All games worked on it except fatal frame... meh, it's okay.

Kingdom Hearts 1 and 2 will eventually block via 7 %

I figured out that if you split the IMG.file via HJsplit,then you can break over the wall (between 190 and 194 MB)

It's worth trying it out.

I can get my hands on fatal frame 3 (called project zero 3 where I live)
if you want I can ask my friend to lend it to me for some time (I want it anyway), I'll tell you what i find 
I'm not a programmer and I don't know the first thing when it comes to encryption and such...but at least I'll try and in the end, that's all tha matters...
I can't find 1 or 2 though...only 3

okay I've found some jpgs too but I couldn't extract them (isobuster's free edition can't do that  and bitmaprip didn't work)
well I managed to extract the audio files 
I just used a program called PSound, it found 132 audio files, they are 722mb so I won't upload them, do it yourself

I'll have to get it again, subscribe to this topic so you get notified when I post the results...
I'll try to get them out of the archives like I did last time but just to make sure, you want the soundtrack files or the audio of the videos?
just to make sure, 132 is the number of files, not the extension, right?

I was actually interested into the Sound Effects (short SEs) of the game.
It means it contains all possible sounds inside this game, Music included.

For example the menu sounds,but...meh whatever, just give me all you could dig out.

Just out of curiousity, as you scanned it, have you got the whole 100 % or did it stuck between 1%-99%?

i only looked for the videos the first time i scanned so now i'm gonna look for the sound files, also my game ripping software is neatly organisized and updated now, in contrast to then

Thanks... but about the 85 %

It's easy to skip it by splitting the file. Just calculate how many bits 85% should be and you got the skip... it would take some time to find the skipping spot, but you get the drill.
