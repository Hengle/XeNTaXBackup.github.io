Hi, I came across a request on another forum from someone who was looking to extract some of the sounds from Biohazard/Resident Evil 4 and noticed something that may be of interest to the folks here. While packing some of the sounds I accidentally dragged one of the dat files into notepad and noticed that the header started with GCAX which I have seen once before and remembered to be an obscure Japanese archive format. The GCAs (.dat files) are clearly not compressed because the total byte count of the extracted contents is smaller than the files themselves plus some of the contents includes long strings of NULLs.

The English version of GCA can be found at [http://www.emit.jp/gca/gca_eng.html](http://www.emit.jp/gca/gca_eng.html) which will be useful for anyone that wishes to extract sound/texture/model files from RE4 but unlike the program above it can also create GCA archives potentially allowing you to mod the game. Of more interest to coders will be the [SDK page](http://www.emit.jp/gca/gcasdk.html) which contains libraries, headers and sample code for this format, unfortunately the documentation is in Japanese but the sample application should be easy enough for an experienced C++ programmer to understand.

As a sidenote the sounds themselves are unremarkable in so far as they can be ripped from ogg.dat with any tool that handles OGG Vorbis files, I used Nova Extractor the first time around then reripped them with GCA to maintain the directory structure.
