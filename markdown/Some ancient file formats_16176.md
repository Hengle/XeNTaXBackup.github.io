- Post Title: Some ancient file formats

Hi there folks, long time lurker, first time poster.

I'm looking to recreate an old 1992ish game in Unity and was hoping to rip some assets out of the game. I've used Watto's game extractor to empty a DIR/001 archive. But I can't find info on the following formats:

.SHP (DOS Shapes file?)
.R3S 
.R3D

The S and D files came from two separate games on the same engine, I think one was a sprite file and one is a 3d model variation. But i'm not sure.

I flat out have hit a dead end on this. I can't tell what programs opened these 3 file types, r3d seems to have been repurposed by Red One for their camera tech, and I can't find anything on r3s and r3d.

Since most of these are sprite or pseudo3d, I was hoping to open them natively thorugh their originator programs in DosBox or Dosemu and capture the contents to move across the Unity. Worst case, if I knew what their structure was, I could probably write up a program to translate them to 3ds or something more modern.

Any help would be appreciated, thanks.

Hi, could you upload some sample files?
