- Post Title: Crunch Compressed Texture

Hello fellow gaming enthusiasts. I extracted some 2d png textures from a mobile game. They have been compressed where the images are broken apart and even stacked ontop of eachother. I beleive it was done through unity using their crunch compression. My question is, is there a way to decompress the texture and/or extract the individual images. Or a tool to render them how they would show in game. Thanks in adavance

While the Unity game engine does use Crunch compression for textures, decompressing these textures without the original assets can be challenging. The Crunch compression algorithm is proprietary and not easily reversible without access to Unity's internal workings.
