- Post Title: Broken Sword 1 .clu files

I would be really pleased if you could take a look at BS1 .clu files.

I tried to extract the files with Game Extractor that support Broken Sword 2 .clu files, but somehow it's different.

here's a link to the sample: [http://nexuspc.hu/~methos05/train.zip](http://nexuspc.hu/~methos05/train.zip)


thank you

You cant open this file at all with an Archive reader.
because there is no index. All files are just stacked ontop
of eachother. By just hexxing the file i see a couple of WAV files,
there are maybe other files too.

Jaeder Naub would be able to extract everything from it. (i guess)

=o

Edit:
There are only a few WAV files in there.
Most part of this CLU file consists of a unknown format
for me called RLE7, which seems to be a videoformat of some sort.
(atleast when googling), at the end of the archive there
are a couple of files starting with "JIM" , and i havent got any clue what
these are. Jaeder Naub IS NOT able to extract either JIM or the RLE7 files.
only the WAV files.

Wavs can be extracted with GAP123 (Game Audio Player) from the clus (all the speech an music), but they're not fantastic quality.

Well, you could always look into the ScummVM source code. They support Broken Sword 1 and 2.
