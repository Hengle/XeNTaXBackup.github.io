- Post Title: QuickBMS script doesn't work on most Wizard101 WAD files

Hey, so I've been trying to just open and convert the .WAD files from Wizard101 so I can use them in MMD, using this QuickBMS script[https://aluigi.altervista.org/bms/wizard101_kiwad.bms](https://aluigi.altervista.org/bms/wizard101_kiwad.bms) since it's the only thing I found that seems to work. But it won't open the new version of Wizard City, any of Wysteria, and won't open a pretty good chunk of Marleybone either. (So far I know it'll open the airship station, Ironworks and I think I also successfully got Scotland Yard to open too) I remember hearing somewhere that this QuickBMS script is pretty old and that the format has been changed quite a bit since it was written. Is there an updated version I could find somewhere or a process I can go through to patch it myself? I should probably mention I have minimal experience with hex code and stuff like that, but I'm definitely not afraid to try that and learn how to do it- in fact I'm more than willing to learn processes like that. Thanks y'all!

Could you please upload some samples? The best option would be to have some samples that work and few other samples that don't work in separate directories.

Here, hope this helps   
There are screenshots included of what it looked like in NifSkope in the link, the files were too big for Xentax to support as attachments.
Some of the textures will be missing there, that's because some of them are in the WorldData files and I didn't feel like waiting for those to load because they're big files lol
The Marleybone one works just fine, as shown in the screenshot, but the Wysteria one doesn't show up. It has nodes and doesn't give an error but it just refuses to appear.

Maybe it's because you are using some old version of Nifskope.
Both samples extracts just fine with QuickBMS and both NIF files
loads fine in NifSkope 2.0. See the screenshots below:

That would probably do it, my Nifskope doesn't look like the one in your screenshots. I'll download the latest version and let you know if I'm still having problems. Thanks dude!
