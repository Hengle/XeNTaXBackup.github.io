Hello everybody! 
I wonder if Luigi could 
create a bms script to open the bin file 
the game Awakening 5- The Sunhook Spire Collectors Edition. 
I translate games in Portuguese 
forum of which I am a member. 

The file in question can be downloaded from the link below:

Excuse me for bad English, because it was 
translated by Google Translate ...

It did not work, unfortunately. 
When the file is edited, the program strangely 
saves it in half the original size, and texts 
are wrong in the game ....
