- Post Title: Need guidance with MSF voice file

Hello, this is my first post. Nice to meet you all, I hope I won't be bothersome with my posts! 

I've extracted voice files from "Dai-2-ji Super Robot Taisen OG", where the format was in MSF. Luckily, I was able to convert the MSF files to AT3
using MSFtoAT3 QuickBMS script. The result, however, yielded positive and negative:
the AT3 file is playable (POSITIVE) but it's sped up by default and is kind of distorted, not sure how to describe it (NEGATIVE). 

I would love some guidance on how to rectify this problem as it has been haunting me for the past year.
The MSF "untouched file" along with the converted AT3 version of it are included in an attachment.

Also, if you need any details, please ask and I'll do my best to give a concrete answer.
I thank you all in advance for reading my post!
