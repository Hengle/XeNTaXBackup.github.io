Photoshop has trouble opening them, and the ones that do open are just a black and white noise pattern.

These are from an android game.

- Post Title: Does anyone know what these .raw textures are?

what is the game name?

15 byte little-endian header followed by zlib compressed texture data

header
2 bytes - unk (always 0x7bd)
2 bytes - width
2 bytes - height
1 byte - format
4 bytes - uncompressed size of texture data
4 bytes - compressed size of texture data

this bms script will decompress all but one of your *.raw samples  

```
string NAME + "_dec"
get COMPRESSIONTYPE short
get WIDTH short
get HEIGHT short
get FORMAT byte
get SIZE long
get ZSIZE long
savepos OFFSET
set MEMORY_FILE binary "\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00"
putVarChr MEMORY_FILE 0x0 WIDTH short
putVarChr MEMORY_FILE 0x2 HEIGHT short
putVarChr MEMORY_FILE 0x4 FORMAT byte
putVarChr MEMORY_FILE 0x5 SIZE long
log NAME 0 9 MEMORY_FILE
append
if COMPRESSIONTYPE == 0x7bd
    comtype zlib_noerror
    clog NAME OFFSET ZSIZE ZSIZE
elif COMPRESSIONTYPE == 0x8bd
    comtype zstd
    clog NAME OFFSET ZSIZE SIZE
endif
append

```

the script also places a temporary 9 byte header in each file
2 bytes - width
2 bytes - height
1 byte - format
4 bytes - data size

to decompress "champ_result_640_960.raw" and "champ_result_640_960.raw1" you have to
append the data of *.raw1 to the *.raw file, then you can run the result through the bms script.  

there is still the issue of figuring out the various formats, but at least this is a start

These are for [https://www.catsthegame.com/](https://www.catsthegame.com/)

I saw another topic of the zeptolab .raw files you posted in and I got them open with offzip and trial and error of guessing the width and height of the image and opening them as .raw with photoshop! Is there an easier way to open them without having to input the width and height manually?

This is some wizardry! I can only assume though the stickers are weird colors due to them doing something with the colors in-game?

And anyways, thank you so much!

what color are they in the game? do you have a reference photo for comparison?
i might need to switch the color channels around in the script.

the compression on your new sample is zstd instead of zlib,
i have modified the bms script here to decompress both types now.

Hello Acewell!

Thank you for your return, I was looking forward to it! 

It works ! thank you very much ! 
Little question, in the APK file, there are .pb files and .zst files (see my zip file)

Do you know what these files correspond to? is it animations, prefab or other? can I integrate them into Unity or extract them with another particular tool?

Thank you again for your help !

i don't see any zst files in the zip, the zps files are 
text files and i don't know what the pb files are for, sorry.
