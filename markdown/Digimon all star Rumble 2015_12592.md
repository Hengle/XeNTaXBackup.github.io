- Post Title: Digimon all star Rumble 2015

hi I am having difficulty in the last part of extracting the models of Digimon All Star Runble ps3.
I tried to follow this tutorial [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJ-VoUnGdB0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJ-VoUnGdB0)
here the link to donwload game iso torrent 600 Mega [https://mega.co.nz/#!XkwyRJpL!LdDZbPesy ... 0YdebT9U4E](https://mega.co.nz/#!XkwyRJpL!LdDZbPesyL1lmleyBarIzCuaBZSeiVJu70YdebT9U4E)
i used CPK Unpacker [https://mega.co.nz/#!3tRlySZB!nm_qrRk84 ... yxkVkMcIjc](https://mega.co.nz/#!3tRlySZB!nm_qrRk845I_NqTGGRYu7kyTJimYTNJ8KyxkVkMcIjc)

1 after downloading the iso extract the files with winrar.

2 go to folder BLUS31441-[Digimon AllStar Rumble] and go to folder  PS3_GAME and go to folder USRDIR and go to folder GameData and go to folder GCM now you can see all files cpk. .

3 is very easy to find the file of digimon that you want to extract the model.

4 extract the file CPK+Unpacker.rar and open the folder CPK+Unpack.

5 now copy one of the files of the folder GCM of digimon all star runble and paste in folder CPK+Unpack.

6 now drag and drop  cpk fil of you digimon in the cpk_unpack.exe it will extract the files in the format bin.

this step by step and equal to the tutorial video I posted  My question is you can see in the video the guy say the bin file even after extracted the cpk it is still encrypted Anyone know how to decrypt the file bin.?
