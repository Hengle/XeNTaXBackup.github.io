- Post Title: Tricksteronline Image Files ^^

Heya There,

Trickster uses different files for every picture with the extention NRI. But the headers are the same, and all contain the words NORI and GAWI.

If I identify them with Trid, it says '100% Autodesk Flic File'. But I don't know how to open that, and I'm kinda sure Autodesk doesn't accept those files because the header is not from Autodesk.
But here, allright, are some Attachments:
