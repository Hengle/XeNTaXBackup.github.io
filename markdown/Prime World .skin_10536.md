Here is a noesis script for this.
[http://en.playpw.com/heroes.html](http://en.playpw.com/heroes.html)
reads the meshes but I did not parse the xml so some textures are not mapped only 3 textures per mesh so no big deal.
Bones not yet read matrix is weird.

Hi, I used your script and was able to access some files, but I'd like to open animated files and bones (.anim), (.skel). They are created in Maya, but not open. Append the script if possible, please. Thanks in advance. Here the required files.

if someone want to import models and animations with Blender, here is a importer for this software.
Most python code i got from Noesis script by chrrox.

How use:

You must INSTALL Blender version 249 and Python version2.6.x (both 32 bits).
Unpack zip and in folder "Blender249[PrimeWorldOnline][PC][skn][anim][2018-02-11]" double click file Blender249.blend.
In Blender Text Window press alt+p and:
1: for model select *.skin file
2: for animation select *.anim file. You need select armature first

After unpack zip archive  try for skip problems with long filenames, rename it to shorter.

@Szkaradek123

Could you make a video tutorial of the whole process? From installing the script to see the actual mesh and animation in blender?
This would help a lot and would really appreciate it.

Thanks
Kind regards,

I found several file formats that can be interesting. Most likely, these are FX files, as well as grid files.
Look, and help, if it's not difficult)
The screenshot in the archive shows a model without maces and the way it should be in the finished model.
Perhaps the maces are stored separately in the attached file.

Hello, can you tell me please how I can import changes into a ".skel" or ".anim" into blender?
