- Post Title: And Then There Were None background files

Hi I need help on trying to get the files from this old point and click game made by AWE. I've tried contacting multiple people from the company who worked on the game but to no avail. The question posed is how to get this encrypted file un-encrypted so that I may use the raw image files to use for a GoldSource project I'm working on. If needed I'll put a link to a mega with the files cause file size is a teeny bit lower for the files I got. Thanks!
