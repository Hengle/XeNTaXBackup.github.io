- Post Title: [Wii - Naruto Clash of Ninja Revolution 3] .SEQ files?

Description of the file

Hi everyone I would like some help understanding/decompressing *.seq files in this game. They're found in chr directories with the respective character names abbreviated for each directory. I believe them to be character data. (Health Values, Meter Values, move sets, etc...). My reasoning behind this is because other people seemed to have cracked GNT4(another entry of this series made by the same company) and their SEQ files hold this kind of data.

[https://github.com/NicholasMoser/Naruto ... ats/seq.md](https://github.com/NicholasMoser/Naruto-GNT-Hacking/blob/master/gnt4/docs/file_formats/seq.md)

Furthermore, I did a search for some hex values in Dolphin cheat manager and found out the health values seem to be 2710 (10,000) and a quick search in the seq file produces a few 2710 values. Overall, I don't really understand reverse engineering all that well and would love to learn more about the process as well.

Example Archive

I'm not too sure what archive is supposed to mean in its entirety. Is it just another name for directory? File? Multiple files?
Anyways, I'm attaching the file in question if you need more please feel free to ask me.

Dolphin emulator can run this file, wiiscrubber can 'unpack' the iso I guess but not decompress the files in question. Also there is some tool set that I've been trying to mess with but have been unsuccessful so far here: [https://wit.wiimm.de/](https://wit.wiimm.de/)

Hey. 
I know I'm extremely late, but I've been modifiying Rev 3 SEQ files lately, and they are not really the same as GNT4. If you wanna chat about it my Discord is Goldy#9588
