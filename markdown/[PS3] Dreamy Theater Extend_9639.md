the files are encrypted need to wait for the eboot to be decrypted to reverse the encryption.

And it only seems to be the .FARC files in the "objset" folder, too, considering the fact that everything else is able to be unpacked/previewed just fine. Think Sega might've caught wind about the model script and wanted to make sure nobody could get their hands on the new models?

once someone hacks it for 3.55 it will be possible to get the models by dumping the ps3 ram.
idolmaster2 can be dumped from the 360 no problem using the ram trick.

i don't think the files are encrypted. i think they use a new file extension witch is .a3da and NOT .gz like dreamy theater 1/2nd so if some one can wright a quikebms script to open the file extenuation or convert it then i think it will be possable to rip. im saying this because im playing around with the files is a hex editor and i noticed a few things.

they are still gz files.
there are some archives that are small and unencrypted containing gz files.

Well and progress are stopped because unknown encryption and compress aglo. I guess it's like AES / XOR because all Sony FS use this.

EBOOT - AES
PSARC - AES
PGD - AES + XOR

and .ect

The files from Project Diva F are the same way, except they have a different header -- 69173ED8F50714439F6240AA7466C37A. I'm almost certain that Sega put the encryption on the files on purpose so that people like us can't get at them.

Don't mean to dig up old treads, but has anything been discovered on decrypting the .farc files? I've seen decryption keys posted in a couple of places, but I'm unfamiliar with writing a .bms script.
