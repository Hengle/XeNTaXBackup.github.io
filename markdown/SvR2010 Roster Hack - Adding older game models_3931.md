Wanted to keep everyone informed on my progress of adding LOW and SvR2009 models to SvR2010.  Here is a video so you can see what I am working on.

Man this level of hacking is crazy. I have been trying to learn the basics of this I was able to replace wrestlers with no problem but, I'm still questioning the model compatibility i understand the furtherest back you were able to go was 2008 but i was wondering do you think on the PS2 which most games share the same graphic and polygon formats that we could import some Wrestle Kingdom models? Also i have been trying to figure out the whole Downloaded Wrestler thing i noticed the wrestlers i DL their headers contain (##( - ( #( where my own creations have number in those void filled by ( can you maybe shine some light on that?

I was hoping to have the roster hack released by Christmas, but it may not happen, so I will start taking applications for those that want to beta test what I have completed so far.  You will get the latest update that I have, and I will send you periodical updates as I get them finished.

There are a few things that will happen if you beta test:
1.  You can not share with anyone else, I want to know who has my hack.
2.  You must provide feedback, and try to help, i.e. assist in making movesets for added wrestlers, comment on stats, help make entrances for added wrestlers, etc.
3.  You will get no explanations or tutorials on how anything works at this moment, I will give you files that will work, you just test for me, and enjoy playing the game, tutorials will come when the final hack is released.
4.  You must have a copy of LOW and SvR2009
5.  You will get credit for helping in the final hack, as a tester.

To sign up to beta test, add me on AIM, username "brienj", send me a request when I am online and tell me how you can help out and if you have the means to test it, i.e. you have "Free Loader" or the ability to make a custom game iso.  There will be no help on how to play the game with the files, either you know how, or you don't.  I would suggest using "Free Loader", as that is easiest way to play the game with the extra game files.  Helping out will just entail making the movesets or entrances, then sending me your save file, so I can add it to the hack.

If I am at home when you send the request and I approve it, then I will transfer files to you.  If I am not at home, I will get ahold of you the next time I am there.  The best time to get me at home is on Friday or Saturday evening, but you can request at anytime.  

To prepare for the roster hack, I would suggest downloading some kind of hex editor (most people here should have one already) and also downloading this program [RAD Video Tools](http://www.radgametools.com/bnkdown.htm) so you can reencode the LOW titantrons, which sometimes do not work properly in SvR2010, and also download [PPF-O-Matic V3.0](http://www.afterdawn.com/software/cdr_software/cdr_tools/ppf-o-matic.cfm), as you will have to patch some of the game files, mostly the model files that are added.

I have put in 2007 models as well, they are just not part of the roster hack yet, they will be done last.  

I am pretty sure the Wrestle Kingdom models are compatible or could be made compatible, the problem is that I do not have the game.  If #a.b.g.x ever has it again, I will get it, or if someone wants to send me a copy for Christmas, that will work too.  

I haven't even fully looked at downloaded wrestlers.  There are protections in place to keep people from changing them.  Energy would be better spent on creating new models for the game.

RVD is now added!!!
[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYx1g7K7DWg](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYx1g7K7DWg)

BTW, see, I can fix any glitch on the models, once I figure it out.  A simple texture fix on RVD and he isn't bald.  

After I made this video, I did a quick color change on his singlet to try out.

What dir/folder are the character menu pics located in 07 & 08? I've extracted the entire iso, and they must be in another format than dat/dds. 

I can easily find them in 09/LOW & 10.

Yeah, and is was a pain in the ass to do.  That's the last one I make.  

I haven't found them in 2007 either, so anybody that wants to make them for the 2007 guys, go ahead, I can use them and add them in.  

No, I got the base pic from some dudes page with all the 2007-2010 wrestlers' full body pictures, I don't have it bookmarked on my laptop, can't give a link right now.  The reason it was a pain, is that the background was white, and not some off color, like pink or purple, so I couldn't do a bucket fill or color replace for the white.  I had to get an alpha channel made, so the background was transparent, or it looked like crap.

I'm already trying to make some menu pics for guys like Goldberg, Sting and Lesnar, in the event that we can do some texture replacement...I'll try to make as many 07 and 08 guys as I can that aren't in 09-10.

let me know the exact format ect you want them saved in...since i'm not exactly sure what you needed to do to the image to insert them into your game.

here's a hogan i made with an alpha channel, let me know if this will work.

I don't have Photoshop on my laptop, will check it when I get home.  I never anticipated having to have it on here.  

Just extract the selection pics out of DLC_HD.pac on 2010 and you can see the exact size the three have to be and what each one should look like.  I think I had to customize my bms script to automatically rename those ones to .dds, look in the folder 100 after extraction and see if the three files have the dds extension, if they don't, then add it, and you'll have three examples for the Rock.  Do the same for the other folders 101 and down to see other examples.  It's using an alpha channel to make the outline transparent.  Remember, three textures, one of a full body shot 256x512, one of a 3/4 shot 256x512, and one of mostly the head 256x256.  

Oh, and I don't need Hogan, unless you mean Hollywood Hogan or something.  

Edit: The sizes have been corrected.

This Hogan is from the 07 menu, (found character art for 07) but probably can make it into Hollywood if this works out ok.

Checked the Rock dds files but used DLC_SD as a reference when I did the Hogan (the HD images look distorted/stretched), and they show up on SD as = 256x256 waist up/head shot, 256x512 full body shot, and a 256x512 stretched 3/4 shot...so the one I gave you is the 256x512 full body....but the size is easy to fix.

I noticed that the Angle picture you put in the menu matches the size of the other menu characters, while other images you put in from LOW are much larger in comparison, so whatever overall size the Angle pic was seems right on. 

Some people probably don't care if it's perfect, but i'm picky that way.  

I also saved this pic as a psd, because it allowed me to keep the outlined alpha channel,and you probably can still save it to whatever format works for you (couldn't figure out which NVIDIA dds settings to use).

You are correct on the sizes, I accidently doubled the widths when I posted that, I posted in a hurry.  I will fix that post. 

The reason the LOW pics look big is that is how they are in the DLC_HD.pac file in LOW, and I am using them straight from that pac file, so I didn't have to rebuild a whole new one.  They are EXACTLY the same size as the 2010 pics.  It is just the way they made the pics.  

I really don't understand the problem with those selection pics, it's not as bad as everyone makes it out to be.    

If you make up some selection pics, it might inspire me to go ahead and rebuild a new pac file, but I need EVERYBODY, from 2007 - 2008 not in 2010 included in the package of pics.  If you make new LOW pics, you have to make them for EVERYONE in LOW.  You don't have to worry about 2009, I can use the pre-made ones.

After the pac file is rebuilt one time, it is a pain in the ass to have to rebuild it again, understand?  And also, I have not filled all the slots I am going to fill, so I do not necessarily know the "wrestler number" that each extra person is going to be assigned.  It's easy to pre-assign the 2009 and LOW ones, because they have assigned numbers already that coincide with the 2010 format.  However, 2007 and 2008 use a different numbering scheme and I have to arbitrarily make up new numbers for them.  

Edit:  After thinking about it, I think I will just decompress all the selection pics and make a new pac file for 303 slots.  It will make the pac file pretty big, but I can insert the pics as I get them from you, and as I insert each wrestler into the game.  Don't worry, if they are in my hack, you will get full credit for making them.  Thanks.

Some people probably don't care if it's perfect, but i'm picky that way.  

I also saved this pic as a psd, because it allowed me to keep the outlined alpha channel,and you probably can still save it to whatever format works for you (couldn't figure out which NVIDIA dds settings to use).
You are correct on the sizes, I accidently doubled the widths when I posted that, I posted in a hurry.  I will fix that post. 

The reason the LOW pics look big is that is how they are in the DLC_HD.pac file in LOW, and I am using them straight from that pac file, so I didn't have to rebuild a whole new one.  They are EXACTLY the same size as the 2010 pics.  It is just the way they made the pics.  

I really don't understand the problem with those selection pics, it's not as bad as everyone makes it out to be.    

If you make up some selection pics, it might inspire me to go ahead and rebuild a new pac file, but I need EVERYBODY, from 2007 - 2008 not in 2010 included in the package of pics.  If you make new LOW pics, you have to make them for EVERYONE in LOW.  You don't have to worry about 2009, I can use the pre-made ones.

After the pac file is rebuilt one time, it is a pain in the ass to have to rebuild it again, understand?  And also, I have not filled all the slots I am going to fill, so I do not necessarily know the "wrestler number" that each extra person is going to be assigned.  It's easy to pre-assign the 2009 and LOW ones, because they have assigned numbers already that coincide with the 2010 format.  However, 2007 and 2008 use a different numbering scheme and I have to arbitrarily make up new numbers for them.  

Edit:  After thinking about it, I think I will just decompress all the selection pics and make a new pac file for 303 slots.  It will make the pac file pretty big, but I can insert the pics as I get them from you, and as I insert each wrestler into the game.  Don't worry, if they are in my hack, you will get full credit for making them.  Thanks.

So i assume eveything was ok then with the psd file...if so I'll start making them.

If you want to PM me any specifics like, where you want me to send the files as i finish them or anything else.

There are some pics from 07 that i haven't been able to find like masked Kane, but i might be able to take a screen shot, and work with what i can from that image.

Well, actually I said I didn't have Photoshop on my laptop, so I hadn't had the time to look at it yet, and now I am on my computer, so I can look at it.  

Ok, that looks perfect.  BTW, is everybody stealing their internet access, is that why nobody has any webpsace?  Or is your ISP crap?  

Man I hate filesharing places.
