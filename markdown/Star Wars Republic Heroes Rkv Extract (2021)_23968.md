- Post Title: Star Wars Republic Heroes Rkv Extract (2021)

Hello,

I would like to extract the models from the Game Star Wars Republic Heroes

I see the archives seem to be .rkv format

I looked at some threads on this website but I didn't find anything still available for download

Are there tools to open, browse and convert those files in 2021?


Thank you very much!

I extract some models with ninja Ripper but it seems some of them are not in t pose and needs to be open rightly, by the way it take not all correctly.
