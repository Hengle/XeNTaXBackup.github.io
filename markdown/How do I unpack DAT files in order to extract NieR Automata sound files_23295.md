- Post Title: How do I unpack DAT files in order to extract NieR Automata sound files?

I've recently been trying to extract sound effects from NieR Automata. So I looked into a steam page dedicated to it. I followed the steps, extracting the cpk files eventually getting to the point of having to unpack .dat files. 

The problem is that the instructions tell me to go on one of the Xentax forums: [http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?p=128926#p128926](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?p=128926#p128926) and use the tool "nier-sound-extractor.exe" by Atvaark. When I clicked on the link it just hits me with an error 404.

If anybody knows how I can download "nier-sound-extractor.exe" or a substitute to unpack .dat files. Please let me know.

Maybe it was deleted by author, who knows.

Here is some other tool for sounds

Thanks for the tools. I think I remember seeing this while looking for an alternative. However, I'd be embarrassed to admit that I'm not too sure how to use it. There doesn't seem to be an exe. file of any kind.

Do you know how to use it?
