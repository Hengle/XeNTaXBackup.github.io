- Post Title: Artdink's Playstation Vita .mdl

If I may ask, would it be possible to make a script of sorts that could work on games that Artdink made on the PS Vita, or does such a script already exist? I know that there are a few scripts out there that work for the PS4 version of the games, or at least Dragon Ball Z: Battle of Z. I've tried to use the existing scripts that I could find on the Vita version of Battle of Z, but it clearly requires more then a few hex changes on the game's file and swapping some of the script's code around to make it work, at least from what I can understand of it.
