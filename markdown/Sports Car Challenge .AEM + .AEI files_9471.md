- Post Title: Sports Car Challenge .AEM + .AEI files

Well this could be tricky. 3D Models are stored in .AEM formats. Meanwhile, .AEI files are textures.
Anyone willing to give it a try? It's a blast if someone does manage to make a .bms script out of this to make it importable on modeling programs like ZModeler 2 and 3DSMax :3 (Or even just an extractor or plugin...)
What i need from this, are the car models and textures. From the looks of it, this (might be) easy to crack.
