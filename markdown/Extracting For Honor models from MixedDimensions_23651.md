- Post Title: Extracting For Honor models from "MixedDimensions"?

It has been ages since For Honor released and sadly nobody has been able to grab models from the game without re-creating them and having poor textures/meshes. I was wondering if anybody could try ripping from their website? [https://merch.ubisoft.com/for-honor-figurine/](https://merch.ubisoft.com/for-honor-figurine/)

Ive tried using ninjaripper myself but I cant get it to work so this is my last effort to try and get these models

I was able to get something with Chrome Cache or you can just use F12 and convert the .gltf to .fbx. Textures are .png.
