- Post Title: Diabolical Pitch [Xbox 360 Kinect] (.file)

I cannot figure out how to dump the files within this .file of the entire game [https://www.mediafire.com/file/76l6ue15 ... F6458/file](https://www.mediafire.com/file/76l6ue159rf0z9l/0E967C3576EB8B90695A76D30E95FB3477DACF6458/file) any help? UPDATE: I just found out this game is on unreal engine 3, I am still unable to figure out how to dump the iso/file UPDATE 2: Friend of mine found a tool that rips this game [https://digiex.net/threads/wxpirs-extra ... ners.9464/](https://digiex.net/threads/wxpirs-extract-content-from-xbox-360-demos-video-dlc-and-arcade-game-containers.9464/)
