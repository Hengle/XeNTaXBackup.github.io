- Post Title: iDOLM@STER Mobile i model rip request

Sorry if this should have been posted in the existing im@s thread instead, but it seems pretty dead, so I thought it'd be better to make a new thread about this.

Anyway, I'd like to rip the models from the free iOS app iDOLM@STER Mobile i, but I have no idea have to go about doing it. Thankfully, the files themselves have been extracted, but they're either compressed or encrypted, and I don't know how to make them usable, but if you can, you can download the files from [http://www.mediafire.com/download/769zr ... bile+i.rar](http://www.mediafire.com/download/769zrzy48nnwgq0/im%40s+mobile+i.rar)

I should note that the base game only contains Haruka's model and all the other models have to be downloaded in-app. As a result, Haruka's model is its own file (model_ha2.dat.eci I believe it's called), while all the other models seem to be in their own container.

Thanks in advance!
