I've already started a project(plugin) for these files.  The files themselves are password encrypted, so if we added generic mpq file support, you would need to know the password to unencrypt them as the just about every file has a different password.

Normall all Blizzardgame archives are compressed with MopaQ and files inside can be easily extracted/replaced with MPQview... all you need is to find a list of the files inside but some fans sites have one...
