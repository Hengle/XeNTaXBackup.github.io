- Post Title: Help with PS2 game textures GioGio's Bizarre Adventure

In some of the files I saw text referencing the TIM2 format all over the place but no trace of TIM files anywhere that I can see. 
some example files are here.

I've found standard SJIS text in japanese in a lot of the files that can be edited fairly easily using a hex editor. (some of the .pzz files)  and some of the .snd files contain raw audio.
otherwise I have no clue what to do.

Hello, I saw the english translation of this game and gave a look at the files, I think the TM2 images are compressed, they are located in the AFS_DATA.AFS archive in the .pzz files, here's the press start screen TM2 image decompressed and the compressed one with the relative .pzz file containing it:

So if someone can write at least a script to recompress the TM2 we are done, since we can already get the decompressed ones.

How did you obtain the uncompressed textures?
