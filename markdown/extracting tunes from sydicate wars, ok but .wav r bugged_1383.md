- Post Title: extracting tunes from sydicate wars, ok but *.wav r bugged?

hey all o/

i was trying to extract some sounds from the SOUND.DAT file of syndicate wars. i thought hey.. your lucky.. syndicate wars has one of the already supported game files! so i opened the .dat file with multiex with "Syndicate Wars (Sound" ... i got a fine list of .wav s.

but after extracting my luck faded :/ i can't open the files i extraced... it says "invalid file type" if i try to open them with winamp or wimepl or audiorecorder.

i tried to open it with the one called "Syndicate Wars (SNDCREDS" but that led to the same end.

any ideas what this could be?

on the other hand if i try to open the "SYNCREDS.DAT" it works without a problem.. (yes its spelled that way SYN.. was wondering if SNDCREDS used to be SYNCREDS)

Hi and welcome. 

Are they large files? Could you give me the one that doesn't work for you and one that does? 

If I remember correctly they shouldn't be too big, if you can't attach them here, perhaps you can email them to me. ?

Thanks! 



PS. To be able to attach anything, you'll need to register first (free).

Okay, the sound.dat that doesn't work has a different format. There's the same type of table at the back showing filenames and offsets and sizes, but the sizes and offsets do not match the actual files in there. Looks like the sounds have been enhanced (they're bigger in general that what they should be). The titles of the sounds do fit them. 

For now, you can open them using for instance the No One Lives Forever .REZ format. Just type *.* after you selected those and you can point to the .DAT file. They have no names, but you can extract them anyway.

Thanks. When I have time I will see if I can fix a script for the altered format.

I've found this download site for old Syndicate Wars game:
[Syndicate Wars download](http://free-game-downloads.mosw.com/abandonware/pc/strategy_games/games_so_sy/syndicate_wars.html)
