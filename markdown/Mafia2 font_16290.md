But this is a char mapping, not a font itself.
The font is probably a DDS image or something like that.
Or are you trying make ingame fonts smaller?

I'll repeat, this is not a font, this is a character mapping, this is used for characters coordinates in some texture file, you need find that texture file.
Forget about this char mapping, it's boring work with this and could cause many problems in game, just replace some useless chars on texture by your special ones(I don't know what is your language).
For example, in Brazilian Portuguese, we replace things like "ä" and "ö"(useless in Portuguese) by "ã" and "õ"(very used in Portuguese), after just needed replace all occurrences of "ã" and "õ" by "ä" and "ö" in translated texts.

Edit: The font texture file of this game is the "pc\sds_en\text\text_default\fonttexture.dds"
