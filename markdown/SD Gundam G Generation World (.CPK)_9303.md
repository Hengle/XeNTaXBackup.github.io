- Post Title: SD Gundam G Generation World (.CPK)

Been trying to get this CPK file open forever. I can get a few programs like UTF_Tab and the Cri File Maker to put out 13,000 unnamed files but I can't actually open the .CPK itself or extract anything from it besides that. I was curious if anyone could help me out here. (Yes I've tried Noesis, CPK Maker, UTF_Tab, CPKUnpack, and QuickBMS)

I guess it's different from other CPK files because it seems to have a unique encryption to it. Also I believe it lacks a TOC which could be throwing off most of the programs.
