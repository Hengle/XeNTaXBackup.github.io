- Post Title: [REQ] Chinese Paladin 5 bone and animation

**NOTICE: if you don't trust the viewer(Pal4_role.exe), 
please run it at a virtual machine or don't run it. 

I know finale00 had already made a script for this old game, but he didn't add bones.
And he is not active now.

[ChinesePaladin5_dff.py](https://himeworks.com/redirect.php?type=noesis&name=ChinesePaladin5_dff)


I put some pal 4/5/5q files in the [Pal_dff_anm_SAMPLES](https://mega.nz/#!ufgWyQRK!gd0jCeU9kWQyTHuk4dZ0gmYILKeHtImcRuGKCrPiWXE), they all use RenderWare engine.
I also put the **viewer in each folder, for checking the model(.dff) and the animation(.anm)

Also, it is much better to export the animation.

Internet. Many people(including me) have been using it for years.

My mistake, if you don't trust the viewer(Pal4_role.exe ), please run it at a virtual machine. 
I have no idea whether it is a virus.
