- Post Title: [PSP] Indiana Jones and the Staff of Kings "pathcache.bin"

Hello everyone,

I want to extract the music from the psp game "Indiana Jones and the Staff of Kings". The problem is that all files from the game are stored in a big archive called "pathcache.bin". Somebody told me that i could use a hex editor to extract the music files but i have no experience with hex editors.

Thanks in advance!
