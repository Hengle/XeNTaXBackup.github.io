- Post Title: Medal of Honor - Airborne *.xxx

I found some music files in the pc folder cookedPC for this shooter. All audio and graphic files use the same .xxx extension. Also each music file is preceded by a fakewav file.

eg AVA_FAKEWAV.xxx
AVA_MUSIC_TRACK.xxx

 I tried opening the music files in AUDACITY, but I get noise only. Has someone devised a tool for this yet?

All the .xxx files are precompressed with LZO

Hi.

Does anyone know how to extract the following file: [http://www.megaupload.com/?d=F2Z7L6AH](http://www.megaupload.com/?d=F2Z7L6AH)

It's Ava_Pes_Cinematics_LOC_int.xxx file in Medal of Honor Airborne.

I've read the topic indicated by Savage, but I can not extract the Medal of Honor Airborne files.

Thank you for your attention.
