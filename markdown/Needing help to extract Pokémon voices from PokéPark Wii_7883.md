Hello everyone.

Does anyone have any knowledge to open .brsar archive, as I want to extract Pokémon voice samples from there.

For what I understand, this uses the same format as Super Smash Bros. Brawl, but all that I want that someone knows the specs for this one that it can be opened without too much effort.

I have archive here just in case if someone is interested:
[http://www.sendspace.com/file/q5wnr0](http://www.sendspace.com/file/q5wnr0)

Also, I decided to use .7z format to compress the archive, as the .zip archive was way too big to be uploaded, so if you don't have 7-Zip in your computer, then download it under this link:[http://downloads.sourceforge.net/sevenzip/7z920.exe](http://downloads.sourceforge.net/sevenzip/7z920.exe)

Edit:Oops, I kinda goofed up what fileformat I was preferring, so it is .brsar, not .brres, after all.

Edit2: Added more information what fileformat is about, maybe this will make it easier to understand.

One of my brsar tools sort of works, but it fails midway through: [http://hcs64.com/files/ripping_mama01.zip](http://hcs64.com/files/ripping_mama01.zip)

If someone else wants to take a crack at it that source may be a place to start. I don't intend on fixing it myself.
