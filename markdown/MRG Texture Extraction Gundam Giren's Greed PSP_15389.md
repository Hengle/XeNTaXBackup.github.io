- Post Title: MRG Texture Extraction Gundam Giren's Greed PSP

Hey all,

I'm having trouble understand this graphics format for Mobile Suit Gundam Giren's Greed, I have the Decompression routine for the SD0
container, but I'm left with MRG files. From research it seems like they are a variation of the MNG 
format that used to do simple animation.

Does anyone Have any idea's on how I can get the images out of this file, they are all marked 'TX' and 'PSET'
sets the dimensions of the image.

I'm attaching the BMS Script, The Packed, and Unpacked version of the file

Also I've looked inside of the MRG files and I think I've identified the following.

is this an old game? i see CMP0 in there 11 times and i found this in search
[viewtopic.php?f=18&t=3470&p=29702&hilit=CMP0#p29702](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=18&t=3470&p=29702&hilit=CMP0#p29702)

the mrg file looks like an image archive with possibly compressed images, might 
be easier to run the game through an emulator and dump the textures with it.
