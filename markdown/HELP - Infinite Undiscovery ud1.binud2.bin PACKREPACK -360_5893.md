Do you just want the models or do you want to change the texts and then repack the files?

No, I'm not interested in re-packing stuff.
But if you're not going to re-upload files until someone expresses interest, people might be passing by cause there are no samples that they can quickly take a glance at.

Hmmm....
QuickBMS crashes and xbdecompress gives a wrong version error or something like that.

Not really sure. You could try using something like grepWin to search inside all the files.
I tried searching for a few strings that were in the game and couldn't find anything.
It could still be inside the bin files outside of the file/MRON00.2 blocks somewhere in a compressed form.
