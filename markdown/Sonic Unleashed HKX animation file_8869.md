- Post Title: Sonic Unleashed HKX animation file

I've gotten the Sonic Unleashed model into HKX format and into Havok Content Tools, but the animations, when imported, give a "wrong platform for packfile" error. Does anyone know how to convert these files to get them working in Havok Content Tools, and/or how to export the as kf files/into 3ds max? Thanks.
