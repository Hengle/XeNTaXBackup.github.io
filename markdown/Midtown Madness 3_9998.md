Hey guys,

kind a outdated game, but could somebody please check the *.cmp file. looks like a archive with an information of a *.mb file - which is a maya mesh file

*.cdds is the texture file - there is a tool in the xentax wiki
[http://wiki.xentax.com/index.php?title= ... s#CDDS2DDS](http://wiki.xentax.com/index.php?title=Game_Tools#CDDS2DDS)
somehow it doesnt start here because of an 'mscomctl.ocx' error

thanks for your reply and help
