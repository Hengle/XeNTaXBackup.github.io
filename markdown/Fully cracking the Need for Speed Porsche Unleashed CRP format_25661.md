- Post Title: Fully cracking the Need for Speed Porsche Unleashed CRP format

Hello, I'm a Need for Speed Porsche Unleashed modder and there have been some ideas I wanted to make, but couldn't, because the current tools don't support all of the games' features  .
The only tool for editing CRP files is the CRP filter for zmodeler1.07b, which is very old and doesn't support a lot of features, such as single sided polygons, car customisation, drivers and animation keyframes and fully functional damage models (as opposed to 2 damaged and not damaged stated for each object.)
What I want to do is make a tool or plugin that makes it possible to add these features to custom cars.
My question is: where do I start?
Thank you in advance.
