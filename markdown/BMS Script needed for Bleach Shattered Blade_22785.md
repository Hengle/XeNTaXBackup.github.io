- Post Title: BMS Script needed for Bleach: Shattered Blade

Does anyone know how to create a bms script for Bleach Shattered Blade? I need to extract audio files from the game cause I'm making english dub mods for Jump Force and need some more voice files. I'd prefer to take ones from this game over Blade of Fate (the DS counterpart to this game. The quality of the audio is most likely better on a console game). I can't believe no one made a bms script for this game already. 

Any help would be appreciated amigos!

Opening like one file for instance with hex editor, the encrypted coding starts with gcax... etc etc. Yea I'll open one of the files up and show you what it looks like;

No, no    

I meant actual upload to some hosting server (mega, google drive, dropbox etc.), so we could open files in hex editor and analyze them.

No, sorry. I can see some structures inside those files, but I haven't noticed any file offsets or file sizes to properly extract files.

That's gotta be the sound files tho, no? 

It was in the sound folder. 

What can I do then?

To be honest, I'm not sure. Someone needs to figure out full archive format and sound data type.

I wish people could learn how to use google. Found solution in ~15min, tested on the provided samples. Bms script and vgm header created by  DKDave.

Im sorry man. I had no idea? Ive been googling for days. What I think I learned or assumed was every game encrypts there files differently based on what program they used when making and using the files. 

So I assumed every game needed its own bms script. I have no idea. So your saying Sonic Unleashed's bms would work to open Shattered Blades?

Yes, it seems [GCA](http://www.emit.jp/gca/gca.html) (gca / gcax header) is being used in many old japanese games, including some from Sonic series. The script was originally posted here on xentax forum, btw. Extracted files will be compatible with [vgmstream](https://github.com/losnoco/vgmstream).

It worked. You are a god, good sir. A god. Now these Bleach characters are as good as done being dubbed and modded for Jump Force!

You need eternity audio tool or foobar to convert them after opening the characters up with that sonic bms script. 

If you still need help join my discord Jump Force Dubbed and ill help you there. I barely am on this site

I'm trying to pull the audio from the same bleach game. Except I get a "failed opening (file path)" error when I try to convert the .dat file using vgmstream. It seems to work fine with other .adx audio files found in the game iso. Am I doing something wrong?

Here's an example of a file that gives me the error:

Look, im not gonna post again after this cause I hate having to return and remember the password. So final update. I have the Shattered Blade files stored away on my pc so instead I could just give you whoever you need (and they open with bms script sonic unleashed) which then can open with foobar, eternity audio tool etc. 

My discord to ask me for the voice files: [https://discord.gg/YAzddYbJ](https://discord.gg/YAzddYbJ)

If it expires just type in Jump Force Dubbed on Discord search. 

Peace ✌
