Hi guys! Here's maxscript to import PC BlackGold Online models with bones+weights (3ds max 2009-2012)

Script to extract files by Ekey
[viewtopic.php?f=10&t=11471&hilit=BlackGold](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=11471&hilit=BlackGold)

1. Run Black_Gold.ms
2. Select t_pose.xskt file (bones, it's importand to select t_pose file, since others are animation)
3. Select model file .xmod, you want to import
4. Select .mtl file of model you imported (have same name as model)

Done!

P.S. Report bugs

It's a weapons, since they are static (don't have weight/bone information inside). You could you this script to import them. It could cause error with some weapon/static models, since I didn't bother with them much. I'm focusing on characters/monsters/npcs

I'm happy to find that this script also works with 3DSmax7 and 3DSmax 2008.
Importing doesn't show any memory error, except when then script enters an infinite loop (occurred once in ~20 tests).
More than half of the tested models imported flawless (eg. 'qh_con_mount_0001', 'boss_0121', 'bg_bear').

Other model imports typically fail on these lines in the script:

```
str += bit.intAsChar (ReadByte bstream #unsigned))
```

and:

```
.. = (Readshort f #unsigned + 1)
```

Then there are also cases where the script reads a file beyond EOF.
I'm not sure which file (xskt / xmod / mtl).

I have a few questions as well:
- Why read the .mtl file when the imported model doesn't have (a) material(s) assigned?
- Would it be possible to make the script more flexible? (eg. "Import skeleton Yes/No")

I also tried to import all separate parts of a playable character.
Parts already loaded got distorted, especially when importing boots, although the same xskt file is used per import.
I guess it would be nice if the script could recognize that the skeleton is already loaded..

Yeah, it's possible. But I'm working on other games now, I lost interest in Black Gold, so if someone would like to finish it - please, be my guest. Otherwise you should wait some time, for me to return to this format research. About materials, yes it's very important to read them - since they pointing how much textures model using, without this info model import will crash! Honestly, all errors you're getting, because there's much types of materials, and I can't cover them all for now   That's the reason some models would crash, especially from newer version of the game/patch/update. It's very weird format as for me, especially animation
