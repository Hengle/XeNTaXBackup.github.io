- Post Title: Tomb Raider Underworld Font File?

I'm now able to alter all the texts in-game (thanks to the sephiroth's translation tool) but I also want to make some changes on game's font file and add special characters of my language onto the file. Is it possible to extract and most importantly import the file itself? I've searched everywhere and though I found a few modding tools, all I could do was extracting, there was no way to import them back.

I found a file with .dds extension but it's not just that, right? If I add a gylph to this file, how will the game identify its position? Help me please

You're awesome!! Thank you so much. If only we were able to see the data file that coordinates glyphs but replacing will do it for us too.
