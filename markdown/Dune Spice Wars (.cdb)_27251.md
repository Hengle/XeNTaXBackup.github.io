- Post Title: Dune: Spice Wars (.cdb)

Theres a 5MB data.cdb file in the res.compressed.pak. I think this file may have what im looking for. I dont know what type of file this is. Im assuming QuickBMS can handle this file?

If someone wants to take a look, I can provide the file here If you need it.
