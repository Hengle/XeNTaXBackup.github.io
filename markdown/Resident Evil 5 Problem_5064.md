I really can't run the setup.exe file inside the DVD.
It just hangs there, and say that the application's configuration has error.
Setup.ini can't get opened either, but the only thing I don't know is that, it works sometimes.

Confusing...  my setup.exe file has no icon sometimes... it's like being blocked by some kind of program.

Look, this is not that kind of forum. We try to edit the files of the game to make mods or translation.
Your DVD or the files are corrupted. Donwload it again or go to the store and buy it if it is a warez copy.
