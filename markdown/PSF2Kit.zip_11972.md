Neill Corlett used to have information about creating PSF2 sound files on his website, but his site has been down since April of this year. While many of the pages have been archived in the Wayback Machine, any link to a file leads to a 403 error page . Does anyone still have this file or any other PSF2 related tools? I'm hoping this isn't gone forever, becuase I have a feeling his site won't be coming back.

Thanks.

I was able to get PSF2Kit.zip from the April 20, 2006 snapshot on this page:
