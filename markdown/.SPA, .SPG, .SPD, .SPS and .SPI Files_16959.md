I am looking to get my hands on models, animations and effects from and old game (Turf Battles).

I am wondering if anyone has any knowledge to how to open these type of files?
The Game is made in UE2 if that is to any help.

Files are as following =   .SPA   .SPG   .SPD   .SPS   and   .SPI

Thanks for your time ~
