Hi!

Just entered this game called CANHEL and i can see in the archives that they have .nif files. .nif file are my favorite files right now but I have no idea how to extract them

luckily seems that the executables are not needed, take a look here:
[http://aluigi.org/papers/canhelpaczip.zip](http://aluigi.org/papers/canhelpaczip.zip)

the tool does also the inverted job, from ZIP to PAC
remember that the tool modifies the input file so probably you want to backup your PAC files (or copying them in another folder so you can modify them without problems).

the only strange thing I have seen has been with the method used in the archives which is usually 1 (almost all the uploaded pac files) or 2 (DTdata_map_a_d03.pac) but in both the cases seems good to force the "deflate" method.
