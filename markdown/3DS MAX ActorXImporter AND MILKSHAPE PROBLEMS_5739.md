- Post Title: 3DS MAX ActorXImporter AND MILKSHAPE PROBLEMS

DOES ANY BODY KNOW WHY WHEN YOU IMPORT PSK MODELS IN 3DS MAX, USING THE ACTOR X IMPORTER, IT IMPORTS THE 3D MODEL POLYGONS AS A SINGLE MESH.

THE BONES ARE MESS UP TO, THEY DON'T LIKE THEY ARE CONNECTED. BUT I DO KNOW WHEN I SAVE IT AS A AUTODESK FBX FILE  AND IMPORT IT BACK IN TO 3DS MAX ITS LOOKS CONNECTED.

MILKSHAPE APPEARS TO DISPLAY THE 3D MODEL POLYGONS AND BONES CORRECT. I TRY TO EXPORT AS 3DS MAX FILE AND AUTODESK FBX FILE , BUT EVERYTIME I IMPORT AS 3DSMAX FILE THE BONES ARE GONE. WHEN I TRY TO IMPORT IT AS AUTODESK FBX FILE THE 3D MODEL IS GONE AND THE BONES ARE ON THE WRONG SIDE.

Hi. Why not asking this in gildor's forum? I think people from there can be more helpful.

Anyway, psk file don't support several objects separately inside one file, never. I don't know about bones in your model. You can send me file that you have problem with, just attaching to this forum a link.

p.s.: and please do not use BIG CASE for typing here.
