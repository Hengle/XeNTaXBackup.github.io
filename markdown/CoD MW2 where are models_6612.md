- Post Title: CoD MW2 where are models?

Hi, I have read other post and I have extracted all file from CODMW2 and find wav sound, bik videos and iwi textures but where are the models?
I wish extract the character of "Price" and "Shepard" for use in 3dsmax (mdl model are ok).
thanks, bye

FF files have the models in a compiled (not the same type as the one that comes with the COD4 Modtools) XMODEL format of some sort, nobody's been successful with it.

yes, but the ff files have only names of maps not characters (except common.ff and other small files); I will try to extract with xmodel.
thanks for response. bye

edit: xmodel not work (don't see files)

What.. Xmodel is a format unrelated to whatever tool you used. and its compiled so its not like the xmodels seen in the modtools.  its not possible at the moment. and the map named ones don't have many models in them, aside from level specific geometry. the ff file that would have the weapons inside (but unobtainable) would be common or common_mp (.ff)
