- Post Title: Armored Warfare compressed DDS

It probably was normal before. Now it uses encrypted DDS with different numbers (dds.6, dds.7, dds.8, etc). 
Here is sample: [http://www.mediafire.com/download/s6a3w ... _Sample.7z](http://www.mediafire.com/download/s6a3w48n5y8l55j/T-72_Sample.7z)
It contains old HD texture (I didn't find normal one, probably overwrote it) and normal and HQ from new version.
