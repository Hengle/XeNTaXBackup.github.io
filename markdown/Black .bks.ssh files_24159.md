Can someone rip audio from the Black game?

Well, you can listen to the .bks audios and convert them using MFAudio tool, which you can download here:

Although, I tested with the sound files here and they loop at certain points (like A-B loop), and unfortunately I do not know how to solve it.
All sounds seems to have a frequency of 32000Hz and they are all mono channel.

Here is the Intro.bks converted to .wav:
