- Post Title: Diablo 3 3D Ripper DX

Does anyone know if the latest diablo 3 build is compatable with 3d ripper dx? Official website says its compatable only in windows xp global monitoring mode, I downloaded vmware and installed windows xp sp3 but 3d ripper global monitoring mode did not capture anything at all.

If someone has it working would you be able to do me massive favor and extract 1 model for me, I need an outdoor grass scene like this:
