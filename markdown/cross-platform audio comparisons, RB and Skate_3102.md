- Post Title: cross-platform audio comparisons, RB and Skate

i was wondering whether you folks might be able to advise on which of the following releases has the best quality audio (i'm only familiar w/ *.mogg files extracted from RB on the xbox, hence all the "??"):

rock band, xbox - *.mogg [36 kHz, 72 kbps]
rock band, ps3 - *.?? [?? kHz, ?? kbps]
rock band, ps2 - *.vgs [?? kHz, ?? kbps]
rock band, wii - *.mogg [?? kHz, ?? kbps]

skate, xbox - *.mus [?? kHz, ?? kbps]
skate, ps3 - *.?? [?? kHz, ?? kbps]

any help filling the blanks would be greatly appreciated!

Skate for xbox360 uses XMA inside the MUS container, thats all i know.
