I was trying to find some information on this type of files on the internet but failed. Actual header starts on 0x2d (everything before that is just some rubbish needed for a game). These files are encoded in a CMPA format and I also believe they are Little Endian. Here are some samples: [link](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B2wXEaIcyofbY2ZvcTBrbDUwT2M)

DDS format, compression DXT1, everything looks like it's backwards. 
That's all I got:

I have more examples! (I'm not the person who sent this but I know them lmao)

It would be appreciated if you could find out how to get these kind of textures as extracting wii textures for Just Dance is only possible with Dolphin texture dump.
