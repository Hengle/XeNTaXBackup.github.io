- Post Title: Gran Turismo 3 music.inf music.seq and music.ins conversion?

Hello everyone, I am working on converting Gran Turismo 3's music.seq and music.inf into usable files (such as MIDI). The main difference between these and ADS are that ADS are just compressed audio files while the SEQ is similar to a midi, with the instruments being stored in the INS file. Help will be appreciated greatly, thanks!
