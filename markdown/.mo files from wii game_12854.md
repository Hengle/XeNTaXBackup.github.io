- Post Title: .mo files from wii game

Hi! 

Please, help me with some unknown format of file - .mo, it is from wii game 'Now That's What I Call Music'. I think it contain audio and/or video itself. Is it possible to extract from this .mo file ? Thanks!

U can only demux with VGMtoolbox(Stream Tools->Video Demultiplexer). Than add header(GENH - PCM RAW (Little Endian)) to audio and play with winamp plugin in_vgmstream.

I tried these steps, but in the created file only noise present. Are you tried to convert this file? Was it successful?
