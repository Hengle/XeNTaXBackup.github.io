- Post Title: Craft The World Translation Help

Hi.

I am translating Craft The World into Turkish. I found the text files, they are already in the folder called lang and in CSV format. For example, when I translate the text "Resolution" to "Çözünürlük", the first language, Russian, is displayed. The reason is that it contains Turkish characters. The solution does not exist yet.
CSV files are separated by , as you know. A column called "turkish" so that I don't have to change the English text.
