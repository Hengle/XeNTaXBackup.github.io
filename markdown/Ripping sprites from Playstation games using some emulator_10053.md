- Post Title: Ripping sprites from Playstation games using some emulator

Played star ocean 2 again recently and it was great.
Now I want the sprites lol

I looked at the contents on the disk but couldn't come up with anything useful so I figured it'd be easier to approach it a different way.

Which PSX emulator can I use that will make the ripping process easier?
What is the general process behind it? Maybe someone can provide an example with any game of their choice.

Or links to guides that might be on PS related forums.

Just use either 3D Ripper DX, NinjaRipper or DXRip, they all will output some of the textures (pretty much only the ones you see rendered on screen - only for 3D Ripper DX), while the others could output all. 

The other way is PSXVRAM (a bit slower, but easier to get all textures) - simply open a savestate made in either ePSXe, PSXFin, PCSX etc in it and try to find the palletes, get it - [http://www.solidfiles.com/d/6035ecddbe/](http://www.solidfiles.com/d/6035ecddbe/)

And finally, use PSicture and scan the disc drive the PSX image is opened/inserted in (sometimes it works with unknown compressed files and stuff - example for pretty old PSX games it works flawless). You can additionally also try "open as raw" using it aswell.

Good luck!

I am interested in ripping 2D images so not sure if the tools listed will work (since I have seen them used mostly for 3D)

I will look into the two tools mentioned.

Yep, atleast one of all these tools can work with any PSX game emulated via ePSXe

Found an explanation how to work with save states and put something together from star ocean 2



A pretty tedious process lol maybe I'll throw 3D ripper at it and see what it gets...

Getting results from 3dripper is really time consuming
