I have the PS3 iso extracted.
If anyone needs my resources, I can upload them.
Is anyone working on the format of model files? 
They have the .edgemodel extension and i think they are different from previous MT framework's .mod OR .dom format.
I have some good info on .mod format but unfortunately could not extract this shitty new format.
I know some guys like surveyor and codeman that have great contributions in extracting .mod and .dom files. I hope these guys and others like them help us to crack this new format like the older ones

Is it possible to make this script working on X360 version if someone makes it on PS3 version? If model format is the same?

I think so. And what about X360 version? Someone works on script? I know nothing about it so I can only upload files from disc.

Even if the PS3 archives were extracted how will you unpack the textures for the models?

I've tried the GTF2DDS in the SDK and it doesn't work, maybe they're encrypted good luck. Just get the Xbox version no need for PS3 for now.

Chrrox why the model is in milkshaped format?
Is it beacuse of the miss of textures OR becasuse you just haven't extracted the UVs yet?
If it has the UVs, can you rip the bones too?

Soroosh the model shown in the above image is just the 3d mesh without the textures, using the Noesis program (he is not using Milkshape).  As for the bones system and corrected rigging of the model... chrrox (or another) would have to be able to identify and then be able to correctly interpret the information, which as I understand it can be more complicated to figure out in comparison to identifying the model itself. Note, the format used for the 3d model is different from the previous games, because the game is made by different developer.

Jodan. Thanks for your kind attention dear friend. but believe me, I know what noesis is and chrox has not used the milkshape3d. if u look at my post carefully will see I wrote why the model is in milkshapeDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD format baby not why u used milkshape to rip it. 
Anyway, I am a hardcore RE modder that have workd on many titels so far and for now are working on porting RE5 Gold edition to PC(yeh its possible but infinitely hard to deal with). To make RE5 more interesting I am planning to replace almost all of the enemies with zombies and other bosses from RE:ORC(if possible) and to do so, I really need the models and if someone can rip them all boned, my challenge    would become a lot easier.
So, I beg you chrox to rip the models boned.
Thanks dude   .

Hey Sorosh, not sure what you mean then about "milkshaped" unless you just meant because the posted image lacked textures, and just reminded you of milkshape... guessing that is what you meant (since milkshape file format is *.ms3d and orc uses *.edgemodel). 

I also wanted to point out, that if you plan to mod for 5, then the orc's bone system, would not be needed (you would have to remove it) since you would need to rig the models to work with the re5 bone system or you would have to create a new bone system that very closely matches that of the resident evil 5 model(i.e. similar construct, but it would be best to use the original re5 bones to reduce potential problems).  

The process would work very similar to modding the re4 game in which a modder uses the bone system of a specific re4 character and then properly weights the mesh to the existing bones...  
 followed by then exporting it back into the re4 format and testing the new file in game.  Currently, for 5 we can rig a new model using 5's bone system, but we have no method to import it back into re5's mod format.

The benefit of having orc's originals bones system would be to use it to mod orc itself, or to use it in a 3d modeling program and use it in a mod that was not dependent on a existing animation system... such as developers tools that permit open access to the game engine (i.e. SDKs).

To get more on topic regarding this file format, I was wondering chrrox (if anyone else who knows the answers to this can reply) will your script be written to read both the mesh and the textures to be properly displayed in Noesis? Also when I first saw luke and flightsuit among the files I was thinking Starwars... it's funny that it actually is the Jedi himself; I wonder if they plan or had planned on making that a dlc thing or if it was simply just a test file.

Jordan thnaks again for your attention and kind description of the character porting process, but believe me I know what I say. A guy nick named codeman are working on importing boned models into re5 and has almost finished it. as  mentioned in my previous post, I know how to port new models into a game. All I need is just the ripped models - better to be boned for ease of the porting process. 
So guys lets just motivate the master chrrox to rip the models faster(and also boned if possible)   .
I will start by offering 100 bucks to chrrox. Isn't anyone else out there with a higher suggestion?
3 ....... 2.......... 1......... 
Congratulations chrrox. Youv'e just won the platnium prize of ripping REORC models. The whole amount of 100 bucks.
Inorder to claim your cash just finish your script and post it on the form fasssssssttttt.
Delayed claims are not accepetd    .

No, the necessary LZX fix was implemented back in Noesis 3.856. And again on that note, if you extracted your data with a pre-3.856 Noesis you need to update and re-extract it.

Yeah, I figured that was the fix in question. I am using your most current release as of me posting this.

Hmmmm. I am sure Chrrox will come through... I am really looking forward to the model script being released!

I am going to wait for the pc release to do any more on this format.
Here is the 2 py scripts you need for the models with uv's.
the first script lets you import the .edgemodel
the 2nd script is basically the same script mr adults did except its a little easier to edit and has all the options listed int he script in case they are needed.
almost all textures except hair are dxt1 hair is dxt5.

Thanks a lot for that script, works like a charm 

It's just that i  cannot figure out the right texture resolution for hair =/ 256x256 seems wrong and 512x512 doesn't work..
would be grateful if anyone who maybe figures them out shares that information^^

Image resolution can be easily discovered according to the image size and ofcourse some trial and error. anyway, below is some image resolutions I have discovered so far : 

Image size---------Resolution-------DX Type
17k-----------------128 * 128-----------DXT1
33k-----------------128 * 128-----------DXT5
49k-----------------256 * 256-----------DXT1
65k-----------------256 * 128-----------DXT5
97k-----------------256 * 256-----------DXT5
177k----------------512 * 512-----------DXT1
193k----------------512 * 256-----------DXT5
353k----------------512 * 512-----------DXT5  
689k----------------1024 * 1024--------DXT1
705k----------------1024 * 512----------DXT5
1377k---------------1024 * 1024--------DXT5
2737k---------------2048 * 2048--------DXT1
5473k---------------2048 * 2048--------DXT5

As you can see the image resolution is tightly proportional to it's size. you can guess the resoultion of other image sizes that are not addressed here according to this reference table  .

Chrrox, the ssg extraction script of MrAdults could not extract all models of levels ssg files. it just extracts the first model file and skips the rest and then extracts the whole textures. 
would u please tell me what is wrong with the script and how can I fix it?

@ lllccc, currently, there is no repacker and no one on this site has mentioned that they are working on such a tool.
@ ReFan, good eye on identifying the correlation of the file size to the images' resolution...

I was curious, if anyone here has experience with python scripts... I want to edit the released xpr script (by Mr Adults) with a set of instructions that will check a selected xpr file (when it is clicked on in Noesis) size and change the values (height, width, and fmt) depending on that file size. 

example without the correct commands...
--------------------------------------------------------
def registerNoesisTypes():
   handle = noesis.register("Hackity Hack Hack", ".xpr")
   noesis.setHandlerTypeCheck(handle, noeCheckGeneric)
   noesis.setHandlerLoadRGBA(handle, hackLoadRGBA)
   return 1
def hackLoadRGBA(data, texList):
# (CHANGES To the script would begin here and look similar to the following...) 
# (fileSize = actual file size of *.xpr w= width h= height fmt= NOESISTEX_DXT1 or NOESISTEX_DXT5)
# 33k size file uses the following...
if fileSize == 33k  then w == 128, h== 128, fmt == NOESISTEX_DXT5
# 17k size file uses the following...
elif fileSize == 17k then w == 128, h == 128, fmt == NOESISTEX_DXT1
# 353k size file uses the following...
elif fileSize == 353k then w == 512, h == 512, fmt == NOESISTEX_DXT5
# repeat this file size process until all varibles are covered..
# changes would end here... would possibly need more lines to explain how the script checks the selected file's physical size and what to do when there is no match to the file size...
data = rapi.imageUntile360DXT(rapi.swapEndianArray(data, 2), w, h, 8 if fmt == noesis.NOESISTEX_DXT1 else 16)
   texList.append(NoeTexture("hacktex", w, h, data, fmt))
   return 1
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Anyone's help or thoughts on how this script could be rewritten to do this would be greatly appreciated... I did do some research online but did not come across anything that would do what I mentioned above... currently I can manually change the script for each condition but it takes more time that it should...any help would be appreciated.

The archive extraction script and the model import script works fine... However the texture import script does not work... All I got are broken/twisted/grained images... and I doubt that the original textures are like that...Can someone explain how to get the proper textures from the xpr files? Thanks.

open the texture scrip with the note pad, follow the textures chart (you can find it in the previous page). you can see that every textures have a size, you have to edit the script for all the kind of textures you want extract..
for example: the texture have size 2737k you have to edit the lines in the script with this: imgWidth: 2048 imgHeight: 2048 and in the compression field you have to write in this case: dxt1.
save the document, restart noesis and you can see the correct texture displayed.. for the different sizes, you have to do the same, but change widht and height and compression as shown in the chart.. btw is this:

Image size---------Resolution-------DX Type
17k-----------------128 * 128-----------DXT1
33k-----------------128 * 128-----------DXT5
49k-----------------256 * 256-----------DXT1

Yes, that chart was posted by REfan, earlier to help explain how to fix the textures (definitely something worth pointing out again as fil1969 has done)... but doing this manually is time consuming, hence my above post to create a script that would take into account the file size and then based on this, correct the image width/height and format accordingly.  

Also it is important to note that while most textures adhere to that chart there is a small percentage of them that do not... so for those you will have to mess around with the height, width, and format to fix those.

Basically we need a script edit that looks at the file size of the selected image first (this is the part that eludes me; I've been looking at different scripts that can do this) and then applies the correct h,w, and dxt format before displaying the image in noesis.

Master Chrrox, I heared that you are working on PC version of REORC. It seems that the PC models are endian swapped and thus your code can't show them. Is it possible to chage your code so that it can show the PC models too? And what's up about the skeletons? have u succeded in extracting skeleton info?

here is the quickbms script for this game it works on compressed ssg files and uncompressed ssg files.
it does not work on some of them that have compressed and uncompressed files in them because it is to much work to bother coding it if someone wants to add to this feel free.

Thanks a lot. Works fine for me. But there is another problem: It seems that .edgemodel's from PC are way different and bigger than xbox ones (they has different headers too) and old scripts for noesis won't load them.

Thank u so much master. You did an excellent job as always.
Have a question for u. Did you solved the problem of negative compression size in your new ssg extration script?
The script of MrAdults could not extract the files with negative compression size and he told me that he don't know how to figure it out? did u find a way to solve this problem?

all files are extracted even negative size ones.
the files that are not extracted are a few stage ssg files that mix compressed and uncompressed files. I know what is happening in those archives but i am to lazy / not that interested in adding support for those. If someone wants to code it i can send them what is happening.

I have a request from u master chrrox and please before u loose your interest like mradults, if it's possible for u, do it for us.
Would u please try to extract the bones too? it's like each .edgemodel file has a coressponding skel data in .ssg format that at it's end all the bones are listed sequentially. is it possible for u to take a look at them and try to extract the bones too? ofcourse it's not a request OR order just a favour from u master to our community like always.

well i have extracted for example the garbage container.. from street detail folder, and simply the uv are flipped, you can fix that using the option "flip uvs" in Noesis.. and works perfect 

also all the vehicles and sceneries..

That should do the trick, look for his post on page 4 I believe it was, Nick. However, i'm still trying to figure out why the material(texture) doesn't seem to be loading with the models, I seem to be stuck with the standard white model. I've placed them in the same folders, ect. Any help or advice would be appreciated, thank you.


Edit: Oops, i'm dumb. xD, the textures are just flipped, ect. However, i'd still like to know how to load them in the Noesis viewer.

Why did chrrox leave it? if he is no more interested maybe you can take his job  . please don't give up and try to complete his unfinished mission whenever u had some extra time my friend. and another thing : chrrox's .edgemodel script extracts the character and object models perfectly but some of the stage models had minor UV problems. can u please take a look and fix it? if u need proof, I can show u some images.
have fun  .

What's up codeman? did u fixed the wierd rotation of skeleton? I think that the skeleton structure is stored in a seperate .ssg file located in the skel folder and the vertex weights are stored in main .edgemodel file. so inorder to extract the whole model with skeleton, you need to process these two files together. am I right?

you can just edit the swb2 file of the character to unlock every weapon in the game no need to swap anything around.

the weapon names in the characters section they are the same names listed int he csv file you edited. just add the weapons you want them to be able to equip in that slot in the right section its very easy to spot based on the existing weapons in those sections. but this is not a 2d / 3d model question more of a modding question.

Chrrox I have a question. Why when a guy that don't know how to edit the files asks a question, u reply immediately but when I ask u that have u worked on extracting skeleton data and u can simply say "NO, I'm no more interested", refuse to respond. if u really are no more interested, like what u did for the ssg extraction script, at least tell us what's happening about the skeleton data so that an interested one can continue your excellent job. please respond my friend  .

Quat??? Please describe more about vertex weights and skeleton structure? Where the skeleton structure is stored? in a seperate .ssg file in skel directory? 
in main .edgemodel file, tell me what addresses contain the vertex weights? How the weights are arranged and stored in .edgemodel file? what is the first address of vertex weights?I think have to wait for a year to recieve your response? can't you tell me about my questions?

If you think that writing a script that extract models from game with bones is a simple thing then do it. Your messages every 2-3 days are unnecessary. You don't help so don't hustle.

It's simple, if you're not polite with whatever you're requesting and you have no patience and let yourself caught 
in despair and for that it seems you're forcing someone to do something, you can get banned. As simple as that.

Don't push the people to get the script-program faster, They can get tired of you and then the guy who is gonna louse here is you. Your way of asking seems to be quite rude. Try to be more polite in order to be considered seriously.

Alright!!!! I thought that here is a game reaserch forum NOT a SCHOOL OF SOCIAL BEHAVIOUR. Thanks for your advice guys. for now I don't have the time to ask anymore for anything. So, don't bother yourself to be a behaviour teacher. If the guys are working on the script, OK, let them do it.
I have nothing to do with them and hope that they successfully finish their awsome job. I GOT ITTTTTTTTTTTTTT. For the last time, I don't care what u think, So please don't tell me how OR what to DO ANYMORE.

Pretty random question but does anyone know if there is any traffic cones or road barracade prop models in the game? I would like to rip them but not sure if there are any

Something like this what you see under Leon's arm

To all guys, I finally did it myself. my tool now supports full bones and textures. if you like REORC models, can easily enjoy them using [THIS TOOL](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=9821)

Have fun using my gift  .

There's not a bone in my body (pun intended) that believes you actually wrote that yourself.

If it even does anything, seeing as how you don't even know the difference between debug and release.

so, I extracted the edgemodel files from the ssg files using the quickbms script posted here.  Most models show up in Noesis using either of the two python scripts here, but many of the main character files, Ada Wong, Four Eyes, etc. are not recognized.  Anyone else having the same problem?  I have the latest version of quickbms and Noesis.
Thanks

Hi
For Blender 249 users here is importer for rigged and textured models from PC version of this game.
It requires Blender version 249b and Python 2.6.6.
For edgemodel and compressed ssg files i used the scripts done by chrrox and aluigi's quickbms.exe.
How to use:
1.run Blender249.blend 
2.in Blender Text Window press alt+p and select from installed folder: (e.g. adawong)
- adawong.ssg from ...dlc\pack1\Characters 
- adawong.ssg from ...dlc\pack1\Characters\skel
- move adawong from ...dlc\pack1\Characters\skel to ...dlc\pack1\Characters\adawong\models
- adawong.edgemodel from ...dlc\pack1\Characters\adawong\models

Hello there. I don't mean to unreasonably bump this thread, but I only ask for more detailed instructions on how to use these tools, as I didn't quite get how to use them. When I do the Alt + P command I get an error, is there something i must change within the Text file?
If anyone else knows how to get this to work properly please let me know. Thank you.

(And don't blame me if it doesn't help - as you didn't tell WHICH error you got.   )

- Post Title: Re: Resident Evil Operation Racoon City

so 3 years ago I asked whether it was possible to get the game's animations into a 3d editing software, and after getting tired of dreaming of them for years, I can present you the ultimate blender script for RE:ORC!
what started as a port of [Szkaradek123's script](https://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?p=104219#p104219) to the latest blender version, ended up expanding massively upon it, supporting animations and LODs for models!

[EXAMPLES (GIFs)](https://imgur.com/a/gfdspIx)
[DOWNLOAD](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FfGga7EJZ5YW1Eu_oOHCknnOSRvakR9Y/view?usp=sharing)

before we go any further, here's what this script CANNOT do:
- ssg unpacking: this part of the original Szkaradek123's script was left out due to it being pretty much unneeded and very low priority;
- asset exporting: you cannot export anything with this script, which wouldn't even make sense because you wouldn't be able to import anything back into the game, as almost every single asset is inside an .ssg archive, for which not even a reliable extractor exists, let alone a packer;
- cutscene importing: it is unknown how to get their files as any existing SSG extractor corrupts data from cutscene archives, and I also have a suspicion that slant six games used a completely different file format for cutscenes, unrelated to PS3 SDK;
- importing console assets: simple, console versions of ORC have different asset endianness and potentially even slightly different file format from my short comparison of PC and PS3 + X360 assets

slant six games used Edge v1.1.1 as animation and skeleton format, which is publicly available (underlined as I respect the rules of this forum) PS3 SDK format, so after figuring out what it was, it became much simpler to work with; animation importer is coded in a way similar to how the PS3 SDK handles it, so in theory this animation script might work with any game that uses the same format, but this is not guaranteed, because while the original format has data compression, RE:ORC doesn't use it thus it isn't supported in this script
the animation importer might very well be optimized to work faster, but as it was my first time working with both blender scripting and python, I simply wanted it to work, it didn't matter to me whether it was particularly fast or not
unfortunately, despite models having an EDGEmodel extension and sony's file formats being called Edge, model format is most likely made by slant six games themselves (its header is S6MF - slant six model format?), which means model importer isn't as reliable as skeleton or animation importer and might fail with some lods or some particular models, as it was manually reverse-engineered by other folks
I have a feeling that it is because PS3 SDK has animations and skeleton code not only for PS3 but also for windows too, while models code only exists for PS3  

importing models:
as per Szkaradek123's script, to import a model you need to open an .edgemodel file, you can get one by extracting .ssg files within the game folder (one example would be dlc\packN\characters folder, that consists of every single character in the game, including monsters and humans)
if you need it to be skinned (have a skeleton), you need to also extract it's skeleton file (for characters that would be dlc\packN\characters\skel) and placing it in the same folder as the .edgemodel, making sure both skeleton and model have the same file name!
currently, LOD4 has broken rigging and potentially materials and it is unknown whether it will ever be fixed or not

importing skeleton:
if you need to import an animation or you simply want to import a skeleton without any mesh, you can do that too: simply get a skeleton file and import it using the script

importing animations:
now the most interesting part 
to import an animation, you need to first import the skeleton or a skinned model you want to apply the animation to and make sure that the armature object is called Armature, otherwise the animation importer won't do anything!
go to Animations\Projects folder of the game and extract .anims.ssg files (for any humanoid characters aka players or npcs that would be Trooper.anims.ssg)
then you find the animation you need, at the end of the animation file name you will see -- and after that there will be a skeleton name that this animation must be applied to, you import the animation you need and after that you will see a file importer window again, this time you must select the skeleton file that was referenced in animation file name (so for example, pm_stand_fp_rifle_injectself_upper--player_male_skeleton would need player_male_skeleton skeleton file, you can get most of the skeletons in skel folder of the game)
after you select the correct skeleton, you're done!
PLEASE NOTE: if your animation has a pistol and rifle version, the pistol version will most likely look broken! this is because in some pistol animations, only hands are animated, the rest of the body is animated in the rifle version, so you need to get the rifle animation, and then merge it's hands animation with pistol version manually!
