- Post Title: How can I get another copy of my registration code?

I had to reformat my computer a couple of days ago and lost the registration code I just bought 3-4 days ago. How can I get another copy of my code to have the full version of my MultiEx Commander again??   

Thanks for any help in advance.

Hmm... Well, do you still have the email that was sent with your code?

P.S. To Mr.Mouse and Captain: Perhaps you should make a sticky concerning registration key problems, it would be better than having lots of little threads scattered all over the place...

I don't.  I usually move important things like that to "saved" folders that are on my hard drive instead of sitting on the MSN server. The problem is I forgot to back those up when I formated.

Well, Mr. Mouse is on vacation right now (I believe he'll be back next week but he moves in mysterious ways). I'm sure you'll get your key back when he returns.

Looking into it this evening. Yes, I'm back from somewhere out beyond the snowcovered mountains in the distance.
