- Post Title: Grand Fantasia PKG Files Help/quickbms script does not work

Hi all! Do not want to bother,but I have a problem with a script to open some files.I know the script says it's for Eden Eternal and Kitsu Saga,but I read in other posts that also works with Grand Fantasia.

I open quickbms,load the bms script ( [http://aluigi.altervista.org/papers/bms/aeriagames.bms](http://aluigi.altervista.org/papers/bms/aeriagames.bms) ),then I choose the file I want to decompress from Grand Fantasia (pkg001.pkg for example) and finally choose the folder to which files go.

And I get this error.

-Error in src\file.h line 178: myfopen()
Error no such file or directory.

What am I doing wrong? I have the latest version of quickbms and Grand Fantasia.
Am I trying to unpack the wrong file?Does the script is correct?

If you need any images or more information to help me,just tell me.
I hope someone can help me because I have gone through all the possible issues with no results.I'm not a total expert when it comes to using scripts, but I have been a couple of years and it is the first time I have this problem, maybe it's just a stupid thing I have not noticed.Thank you very much ^^

Thanks Ekey,but I saw it before writing this post for help and apparently,even if you're registered on that forum,you do not have the full rights to download it if you have not uploaded useful posts and stuff.So I can not test the tool to see if it works.

But thank you very much for taking your time and helping me!

Oh thank you very much Ekey! It worked perfectly and I can now investigate the files and view them. I do not know how I can thank you.
