The file archiving for the .tre in star was glaxies has changed. I used to use MultiEx with the Xantax tre archiver but it now doesn't open anything from the publish 18 .tre's and above.

Has anyone had any luck or is anyone looking at it?

Well, they have indeed changed the format. Now they have not compressed a header. But they have removed the sizes of the compressed DDS files in the archive you sent me. Are there any other files that could contain lists of those? Are there files with the same name, but a different extension?

from same publish.

Beside main EXE file,

There is 4 files changed with this first publish those new format introduced to game.

patch_18_client_00.tre
patch_sku1_18_client_00.tre
patch_18_shared_00.tre
sku2_client.toc

Also interestingly, with publish 19, sku1_client.toc downloaded too. I guess names of these files are in those. 

But point is I don't know your email    I'll be happy if you can provide me an email to send 4 files total 2.5 mo's.

Do you have any of these?

patch_sku2_15_00.tre
patch_sku2_15_01.tre
patch_sku2_16_00.tre
patch_sku2_17_00.tre

Looks like the .toc file is a Table Of Contents of these files.

Yes I do.

They are each 5-9 mo's. If you need I will upload them somewhere too.
But those are already "extractable" with Xentax , they are in old format.

You mean with the TRE Archiver. Our "small organization"  is XeNTaX.  
Okay, so they are in the old format. Then the TOC may point to the location of files in the old formats to replace with new ones?

Oh yes, TRE Archiever sorry   

The files you pointed are old format and can be viewed by current TRE Archiever. 

I'm not sure what you mean by "TOC may point to location of files in the old formats to replace with new ones" actually...

You mean TOC may show new EXE who can read "new format" to find old files, that may be yes.

Header:
QWORD = TOC 1
DWORD = File number
DWORD = relative start of file summary, headersize+tre-list+this = file summary
DWORD = ? (not necessary for unpack)
DWORD = ? (not necessary for unpack)
DWORD = TreFile Number
DWORD = TreFile describtion length

TreSummary:
simple text seperated by hex(00)

FileInformation:
WORD = Compression (0 = uncompressed , 2 = zip)
WORD = Number of trefile which contains the file
DWORD = ? (never used them to unpack the files)
DWORD = ? (never used them to unpack the files)
DWORD = position of the file inside the trefile
DWORD = uncompressed size
DWORD = length inside the trefile if compressed else use uncompressed size

File names and pathes
just like the tre summary, strings sepperated with hex(00)

I have written a small utility that will read a TOC file and extract all files from the TOC's list of TRE files.

If anyone knows vb.net, let me know. I'd like to collaborate on making a nice GUI for it. 

I'd also be happy to work with XeNTaX to incorporate it into their application.

It uses the SharpZipLib library for the decompression routine. It actually runs pretty quick.

That'll be great. We could make it a MexCom plugin, or perhaps better still, an RPM (Rahly's Plugin Manager) plugin. It would be a test case for Rahly's manager, as that is brand new and will be released with the upcoming new MultiEx Commander. I'll PM Rahly about it.

Any response from Rahly? I've worked on it a bit and have an application similar to SWGInside for it. works great, albeit a bit slow in preparing for extraction when over 7000 files are selected in the listview. (some delay determining the filenames from all selected listview items). Other than that, it works pretty smooth and pretty quick.

I was able to extract all files from all the TRE files listed in all 3 TOC files within about an hour.

Well. I created my own source for everything except the SharpZipLib (although the source for the SharpZipLib is freely available, and I have not modified it).

The whole thing is written in .NET. My application and TOC/TRE file library in vb.net, and the SharpZipLib is written in CSharp.net.

I don't have the original source code for the SWGInside. I wrote my own off the basic behavior of their tool (Which BTW, appears to have been written in C++ 7.0, part of the Visual Studio.NET set, but has no CLI)

OK, I've used the above method to write something up to process the TOC file...

All the data (file info and TRE it is in) gets built and looks correct all for 1 value. The offset value (starting location of the file inside the TRE pack).

I feel I'm missing something somewhere, just do not know what....

Example :

File : welcome_e3_convo.stf
TRE File : patch_12_00.tre
Compression : 0
Start : 3235401 
Length : 1022

Now the length is correct but when I look at this TRE with SWG Explore, it indicates a Start location at 19210683 which is the correct point in the TRE pack.

Update....

I have seen the error of my ways... 

The file pointer info is correct for the Patch_13.tre file. So, after doing a full sweep and checking. I figured the problem in the coding. I was starting the TRE file index at 1. The number in the file info area starts at 0.

So, after changing a few lines...BINGO.

Unfortunately, I do not think this will be of much help to anyone since my code is in PHP. There are 12 specific files I need to extract then run through another PHP script to generate a Database for a Web Character Builder.

(PHP compiled with zlib, and I have to do 2 passes on compresses files because some respond to gzuncompress while others need gzinflate)

Basically, once my gaming machine grabs an update, run the PHP script on the server and it automatically extracts the files, parses them for the info needed and builds it's database automatically. Takes about 5 minutes for the entire process and the Web Character Builder is up-to-date on the latest version information.

This is kind of going over my head now with the programming talk. Is it any closer to getting into working???

If anyone needs help for a GUI I will more than happily desing and cut up graphics for it but thats about all I can offer as its only design and 3d stuff which I can do.

There are quite a few people out there able to extract the files but none have made a public release.  This is probably due to the fact that they have no workable GUI and they just extract every file at once.

So PLEASE don't stop working on this!  A dev has confirmed that stuff from the new expansion is already in the TREs so there are lots of people eager to start digging!

Its true, they are going crazy all over the forum. I hope its only a matter of time before they update one of the older programs with the new file format.

I believe so, and for thos einterested SWGExplorer comes with its source. [http://swgexplorer.dras.us/swgexplorer.htm](http://swgexplorer.dras.us/swgexplorer.htm)

ok the files are all seperated by hex(00)
now count which file it is from beginning of them starting at 0 or 1 
if you get the right number go to position after the tre file list and start to count. 24 bytes are one data unit like described in my summary, so you have to count 24 * [your number] bytes.
just look the following data and read the 2nd word and you will see in which tre file it is, which are listed at the top of the toc file (also remember where the data starts inside the tre file =) ).
now you should be able to find the right position

I am now also working with Maxitron to incorporate my TOC File/TRE File v6 additions into his SWGExplorer.

I have successfully completed the mods to read TOC files, and thus all tre files within them, and of course be able to view/save the files within.

I will next be adding a feature to auto-detect which format the TRE file is in, and pull the necessary index data from all TOC files related to that TRE file.

Lastly, I think Maxitron should incorporate a feature to batch extract an entire node of the treeview (or the entire treeview itself).

I'll help where I can.

Here is a preliminary update of SWGExplorer that lets you open TOC's, thanks to all the code additions from wzydhek.  Plan on doing a few UI upgrades later on, plus the stuff mentioned above, with a suprise or two thrown in.

You can monitor and download the project [here](http://savefile.com/projects/525958), and even subscribe to a mailing list that will notify you of updates.

The first download is necessarily large to include the Managed DX9c runtimes needed for real-time texture viewing, though future updates will not include this download.

Go crazy!

Just commenting. I have been testing it and I am able to get it to work.
It takes some time to open the SOC files, but it's better than nothing. I have been able to clear up some questionmarks already.

Thanks for your help.

snd files just contain the path to the mp3 or wav file.
just open it with a normal editor and search for the right path and file.

I use Ultimate Unwrap 3d with the plug in they have on there site, but it is a pay program. 

Also, i was wondering if anyone has made an extractor yet for V6 TREs

Hehe, well I guess people lost interest in this thread some time after it got posted. Most of the time it means that progress was difficult and then halted.

If you wish, you could attach some TRE file (new version) and we'll see what it's about.

Hi

I took the liberty of downloading and installing the SW Galaxies demo (thank's for the link btw, been thinking about trying this game out for some time) and making cutter files of a few archives.

I've posted what I think are textures, music and sounds since they might contain already known fileformats. Filenames are original.

Cheers

Sound = WAVE files
Textures = Havent got a clue!

however, if you are only out to rip out the music
and sound, the new jaeder would do the trick 

[http://jaedernaub.ath.cx/JaederNaubV1.8.2a.zip](http://jaedernaub.ath.cx/JaederNaubV1.8.2a.zip)
(dont use the 1.8.1d, it had an mp3 bug)

atleast it ripped out the first mp3 file from the music cutted,
so i guess it would take the rest :X

Thank's Strobe (Tackar )

Cool program man. Extraction of wav's and mp3's works just fine with these. Dunno whether the filenames are original or not (tried different settings for that), but I guess the important thing is you can access the actual sounds and music (in this particular case anyways).

Thank's again (mycket uppskattat).

Always a pleasure to be of any help =D
And I see we have another swede here aswell !

The program does never recover any original filenames
(and will probably never do) :X.

it just names them with the correct extension,
and other naming (like offset+length) if you specify it.

The Texture should be .dds 

and the mesh files should be .msh or mgn

Now if someone could just make a extracter  there is one for the verson 4000/5000 but not for 6000

The textures in the file that was attached are DDS and Zlib compressed. The sounds in the other file are NOT compressed. However, I don't see any information about offset and size of each resource in the TRE file. This is version 0006TRE (ERT6000) and I wonder if there are additonal files that do list the contents of each TRE file ? 

You should look in the directories, perhaps there are files there that could list this. On the other hand, isn't this an online game? It could also be that the game retrieves the lists from the SW servers. In that case, we have a bigger  problem.

There are a number of files in the directory, several logfiles with the ending .log and a few configurationfiles with the ending .cfg and a few .xml files. There is also one file with the ending .toc.

There are also a lot of files with non-descriptive names with the ending .tmp

Any idea on what kinda files we should look out for? I could post a screencap of the directory or I could post the contents of some of the files being in text format if it would be of any help.

There are also a lot of files with non-descriptive names with the ending .tmp

Any idea on what kinda files we should look out for? I could post a screencap of the directory or I could post the contents of some of the files being in text format if it would be of any help.

Cheers

xml is nice, and toc could be "table of contents"?

Confirmed! The TOC file that was linked to is indeed a table of contents! Now, let's see what i can find out! 


Could someone upload this file: 

patch_sku2_15_00.tre

Thanks!

Yeah, that's what I figured. There are also a number of .dll files I forgot to mention, dunno how important they might be.

Anyways, I'm attaching some of the files that might or might not be of interest. They are all the .xml files along with some .log files and a .cfg one. They might be worthless to you but I figured there's no harm in me posting them just in case.

Cheers

Oops, sorry. Missed this. However, I'm afraid I do not have a file by that name in my directory, probably because my 10 day trial period ran out and I never got to downloading that patch?

I'm posting a cutter version of the .toc from my install for reference.

If I'm not mistaken, I think a filecutter version of the file would prolly be enough? (please correct me if I'm wrong)

You can find the Mr. Mouse FileCutter [here](http://www.xentax.com/downloads/tools/filecutter.zip) and Watto's Filecutter  [here](http://www.watto.org/extract/download/cutter.zip).

You can then attach the .zip you get to your post.

This is becoming a real nusance. My Cutter worked well for everyone, until all of a sudden people report that the tool doesn't work anymore. But it still works at my computer. Odd, but irritating. It must be the tool. Anyway, use Watto's tool, until I have time to fix the damn Cutter of mine, if ever.

ok, with exactly I meant the exact number of total bytes. 
You can click on it with the RMB and selecting Properties will show the exact size (and the size on disk).

Ok thanks. It's kind of odd as that file is actually a 0005 TRE file, which should open with the TRE Archiver. But I can't test it, cause I don't have the whole file. The header of the file points to a tail, but that doesn't seem to fit with the size of the file. 

Also, these are all patch files, right? Does that mean that they are only addressed during a patching process? I could imagine that a sort of main TRE file would be updated during this process, and after the patch the patch.tre files would no longer be needed/loaded? 

I don't have the game, so I can't test things out thoroughly. 

In other news, I have updated the TRE Archiver to be able to open TOC files. What follows should be code that actually does something with this.

All I know is that SW Galaxies downloaded a truckload of patches in the few days I used the trial.

Among the SW Galaxies files I attached above, theres a file called "StarWarsUpdate.log" which seems to contain information about what is loaded and when.

If this file could be of any interest though, you probably need the one Byme has since those are the files you've used as reference.

Apologies if I don't make any sense with this (more than likely), I'm just guessing here.

I believe that all the patches are loaded when the game loads. It goes from oldest to newest, because if you look in the .tre files, all you see are what's updated in the newer version.

      Modding goes by creating a folder then the file to replace inside of it. (for instance ui\ui_styles.inc).

Right, so the patch_sku2_15_00.tre file can be opened by TRE Archiver already, I tried and it works. Like I said, its a version 0005 TRE. I guess then the problem is with the 0006 files.

Here's the new TRE Archiver. The Friends of MultiEx (version 4.2) can use the TOC feature.  Just opt to open a TOC file and see if the archiver could find the right TREs. Then click to open it.  

Interestingly, the number of resources referred to by the TOC file may differ from the actual files in the TRE referred. 

Read the readme.txt and the short manual.txt.

Thank's Mr. Mouse. 

So if I understand it correctly, if I can't open a .tre using this then and I'm pretty sure it's one of the later versions (i.e. post 0004), then it's safe to say it's not possible to open because it uses compression method 1?

Does this change if one goes via the TOC, or are the criterias of which types of files that can be opened still the same regardless? I would of course try this out and find out by myself, but unfortunately I removed the installation because my trial period ran out...only saving the .tre files.  

Thanks again

TRE 0006 should be opened via the TOC method, TRE 0005 should be opened using the TRE method. The TOC files refer to 0006 AND 0005 files, so you could also open those 0005 files via the TRE method. Perhaps I should include an option to identify a file  

Are there any 0004 files still around?

Aha...ok I see. Not so smart move of me removing the .toc file then.  

Regarding the 0004 files, I have no clue. I don't know how to identify them and tell them apart and I'm not sure how many of the files in the install are removed or changed when updating.

If I knew how then I could check the .tre files I saved from my install if that would be of interest.

EDIT: Ok I'm gonna come off as a complete noob now (newsflash  ), but I used a hex editor to open a .tre file and in the the beginning of the file theres this info: "EERT5000". Does this perhaps indicate the version of the file?

Cool. Then I shall add a ID option and all TRE files can be extracted again.  As Byme said, modding can be done by creating the correct folder and the right files, so for now I'm not going through extra trouble and make those TRE0006 adaptable; extraction should suffice.

Had a slight problem when using the option "Extract all files..." on the patch_15_02.tre file. It starts extracting and then I get the message:

"Run-time error '9': Subscript out of rannge"

Pressing ok exits the program.

So far that particular .tre is the only one I had this problem with. Will investigate some more and check out the rest of the files as soon as I get the time, have an dentist appointment today so I gotta go soon.

TRE Archiver is part of the MultiEx project now, and requires support. Time that goes into helping visitors of these boards is valuable, especially if whole programs have to be written (instead of BMS scripts that could be easily done). Figuring out formats costs time, coding programs cost time and then continued support costs time and the website costs time and money. Normally not a problem, but this is just a little too much time.  So a registered version 4.2 of MultiEx Commander is needed. Sorry.

I know I am bumping a old thread here but I am having a few problems with the program.

First one is when I access a .toc file and try to then open the .tre, the program is tells me this option requires a registration of MultiEx Commander. (Which I have)

The second problem is say I open patch_01.tre then extract it to a new directory. I get the following error -

"Run-Time Error 9 Subscript out of range" and the programs shuts down. 

Hopefully someone can help,
Thanks

Subscript out of range is a programming error, trying to access an indexed object (Array) with an identifier higher then the amount of entries that exist within the object.
