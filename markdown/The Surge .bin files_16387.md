- Post Title: The Surge .bin files

I've used the bms script supplied in the main archives forum to unpack the game, and it's done a marvelous job - however once unpacked I found the expected textures, meshes, and whatnot, but also there's a folder full of .bin files that I think have the data that the makes up the stats for the various weapons, monsters, and other game items.

Is there any chance I could get one of you wonderful people to figure out how to decompress/decompile these .bin files for me?
Linked is a rar with the lot of them (it's not very big, only like 9mb).
