For extracting the models you can use Nifscope 1.0.22 or blender with Niftools.
There's some trouble with the created obj file.

concerning your edit:
yeah, there's some trouble with the obj - my link showed a way how to fix it.

Give more informations on what you tried so far and what your problem is exactly.
Did you get the mesh? From your opening post I guess: 'no'.

Getting the animations is the last (and most time consuming) step in most cases.
That's the reason why anim requests are rarely fulfilled.

You really should start with the skeleton (assumed you have the mesh).
Just my two cents.
