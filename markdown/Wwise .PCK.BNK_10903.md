- Post Title: Wwise .PCK/.BNK

Sorry, I accidentally posted this in the wrong section last time.

Anyway, does anyone know any tools that can extract .pck and .bnk sound containers? I know that Ravioli Game Tools can, but the results are rather... non-optimal.

I recall reading a thread on this topic earlier but all the links were dead.

Hm, that's not really much better. Is there no way to get filenames?

The BNK script worked though, thanks for that. Also, both produce .wwise files. I tried running those through ww2ogg, but it didn't really work. Any tips on those?

The Wwise engine doesn't have any file names attached, just the CRC.

Have you tried ww2ogg with different parameters?
