[AlphaTwentyThree's FSB4 scanner doesnt work since there is no fsb files in the .xxx packages...](https://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=21&t=3673&p=171417&hilit=wheelman#p40285) So any other suggestions?

Can you upload a few sample files?

You can also post more details... what platform etc.

Hi,

Here's one, filename: [MUSIC_FMOD_Radio_American.xxx](https://expirebox.com/fpk5F) expires whenever. Is that enough to work on? Oh and platform is on PC, it's a PC game.
