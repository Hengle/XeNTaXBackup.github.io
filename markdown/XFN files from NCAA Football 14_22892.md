- Post Title: XFN files from NCAA Football 14

Attempting to mess around with shaders in NCAA Football 14 and come across this file(I've cluded two of the files and a screenshot of viewing it in a hexeditor). Just wondering if there would be a way to make this readable? Also the files have a ".DAT" extension because of the tool we use to extract files.

It's not archive, it is some shader file. Did you try to google it?
