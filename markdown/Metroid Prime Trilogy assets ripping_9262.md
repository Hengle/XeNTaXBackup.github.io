- Post Title: Metroid Prime: Trilogy assets ripping

I have Metroid Prime Trilogy for my wii, what kind of assets can I rip from the game? I'm interested, other than obviously the models/anims and the updated textures, also BGM (which I think have been upgraded from the GC versions) and sfxs if possible.
Any idea?

some insight, please?
Noesis can extract them but not preview them I think.

Nor is Other M supported, right?
