Since you aren't specific what is your looking for, nfsu360 has a CarToolkit you can get on his blog: [https://nfs-tools.blogspot.com/](https://nfs-tools.blogspot.com/)
If you want other assets, you might wanna try one of these two for other geometry from the game, rumor has it that works with assets extracted from game, not just cars, i personally never tried it besides on vehicles:
[https://www.nfscars.net/need-for-speed- ... view/6292/](https://www.nfscars.net/need-for-speed-underground-2/6/files/view/6292/)
[https://www.nfscars.net/need-for-speed- ... view/7762/](https://www.nfscars.net/need-for-speed-underground-2/6/files/view/7762/)
The executables are not identical, one should work for first game other for second.

Do not mislead people, such tool does not exist publicly, only screenshots have been showcased in the past, years ago, nothing else.
