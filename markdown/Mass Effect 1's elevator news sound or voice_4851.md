Mass Effect1 (Not 2) have speaker announcements such as usually elevator, tram or similar area.
These are news on business, political, war or science.
Nothing has been found at *.isb files in .../BioGame/CookedPC/Packages/ISACT.

Do u know what files have these contents and how to extract these from sound files?

I don`t know if you`re still searching but I found them. 

sp_news_vids.isb are the news in the elevators and this file contains a lot of banter too.

sp_follower_interject.isb contains a lot of elevator conversations. 

You can extract them with psychonauts explorer. You can download it here: [https://quickandeasysoftware.net/softwa ... s-explorer](https://quickandeasysoftware.net/software/psychonauts-explorer)
