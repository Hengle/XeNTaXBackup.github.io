Have you tried Ninja Ripper? It's great for getting models from any game. Version 1.7.1 is very good for this.

This version of Ninja Works for both older games (such as Dawn of War - Dark Crusade released in 2006) and newer generation games (such as Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain). I've tested it on both and it worked. I believe that in this game you want to extract the models will also work. Just select the correct game .exe and launch using Ninja Ripper.
