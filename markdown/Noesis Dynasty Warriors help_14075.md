- Post Title: Noesis Dynasty Warriors help

Noesis won't read from the Dynasty Warriors PSP versions LINKDATA.bin despite it being added to the list of supported games. It says "File could not be previewed", on trying to extract it says: "The file type could not be determined".

I can use Gitmo to extract the .GMO files and view them in Noesis, but they are missing textures and animations!

You'll have to dump the textures yourself using some kind of emulator like JPCSP or ppsspp.
