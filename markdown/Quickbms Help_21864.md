  offset   filesize   filename (?)
--------------------------------------
files 5
addr: 2048, size: 2343936
addr: 2347008, size: 2132888
addr: 4481024, size: 288
addr: 4483072, size: 1461936
addr: 5945344, size: 1174168

I'd suggest to insert (debug) print lines such like:
print "files %FILENUM%"

The third found file params (addr: 4481024, size: 288) lead to this:

Now you gonna have to insert a log line to get/log the files.
Good luck. 

btw: I assume chr_dat2 is not part of the file contents (not sure). You may read it and use it to name the file to be logged.
