- Post Title: New guy here!

Just want to say hi to the community, nice to meet you guys.

I'm here because I'm often disappointed with the games I have, most of them are obviously fully optimised and I can have 4K resolution, uncapped frames, anti-aliasing, etc. and then there's SOME games out there that don't even have features like that for PC ports, so I have to manually dig into those files and change some values and hex addresses so they work exactly the way I want them to.

Speaking of files, I want to pull apart my games and harvest whatever assets, textures, sounds, and movies I can get my hands on! That's why I'm hoping you guys can help out.

Right now, I'm trying to extract files from a couple of games I like, specifically Bayonetta and Catherine. Just because their files are heavily compressed doesn't mean they can't be fully unlocked.

Hope to get to know everyone on the site!
