Hey all, i'm trying to figure out how to extract the files within these files, they look to be an archive of sorts but I cant seem to figure out how it works, I've managed to extract .wav files because they're there in plain text but everything else is a mystery to me.

Here's hedz.hdz cut by WATTO's File Cutter:

And here's C_Dtown.cmp (First level in the game):

I have a feeling the answer might be in the exe file for the game so if anyone wants it, feel free to PM me.
The game should be considered abandonware anyway but just to be safe i'm not going to post it in this thread.

Edit: Fixed the links.
