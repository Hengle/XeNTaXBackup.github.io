hi,

i work with hcs on the in_cube plugins ([http://hcs64.com/in_cube.html](http://hcs64.com/in_cube.html)).
The wam format is allready supported by in_cube, but this one seems to be a different one.

we're working on supporting more stuff for various console (xbox, wii, ps2, psx, nds) and allready several wii formats are supported, but not this one 

i'll try to add support for this format in a future in_cube version.

thx for info & samples.

bye
