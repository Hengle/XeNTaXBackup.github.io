HCS CPK Unpacker doesn't seem to like the archive.

Your best hope would be posting on the HCS forums and asking him to take a look and see if he can modify his tool.

This archive has nothing to do with the existing cpk extractors it just happens to use that extention.

No i mean cpk is used in a specific console engine.
This game has never used the same cpk format in any of its versions so contacting him is useless.
this also looks like its just direct engine resources like a model and not a real archive to extract.
