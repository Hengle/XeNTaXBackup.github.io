Finale00,

I improved your great pseudo code:

chunkType $4101 --> Object Names
chunkType $4301 --> Material Names
chunkType $4508 --> Texture Filenames


For the bone (and other) objects:

Vertex Size=chunkSize / numVerts

Vertex Size 68:  Use the Vertex Size 36 structures and read the plus 8*4 bytes.


I released the 3D Object Converter v4.80 full/portable and update package now (with the improved .mmb loader module).
You can update your installed application (version>=4.0) quickly and easily using the auto-update function (Help/Check for updatesâ€¦).
