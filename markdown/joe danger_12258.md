Thanks shakotay2!
Works great! ...but I will study this tool because I think each mesh uses diferent values, I don't know how to set them. Seem so hard!

Once you've done the example in the tutorial things should become more clear.

Tell me if there are any indistinct parts in the tutorial - then I can try to improve it.
