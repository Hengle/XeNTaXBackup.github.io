- Post Title: [PS2] Dragon Ball Z Budokai Tenkaichi 3 "FOD" File

Hi All, First of all, I don't know if I'm posting this in the correct section, if isn't, please move it, and English isn't my primary language, so, I apologize for the grammar errors.

I have been looking inside the Menu files of the game "Dragon Ball Z Budokai Tenkaichi 3", I managed to decompress them and open with an hex editor, but inside the file there is a paragraph that contains the string "FOD.LIT" and manages all the images and parameters of how works the entire file, like the instructions "pad_false" or "disk_plate_in", I wonder if there's a way of modifying this file.

Here is an example of how it looks in the Hex editor:


Anyway, i will attach the complete file of this file that is inside the Ultimate Battle Mode (specifically the Disc Fusion section), for anyone that want to look at it.
