- Post Title: Tray Launcher Sharp v1.3

Tray Launcher Sharp is a dynamic, customizable, menu system for starting programs. It works in an inheritable fashion where command arguments can be concatenated on each level. It has been reengineered in C# and is supposed to be free of any bugs present in previous incarnations.
