- Post Title: .xmesh from a old chinese game!

Hello, I found a very old external disk, and I remembered that there I had downloaded some games (vmdk) from pan baidu, I just mounted the disk to be able to review one of those. I managed to find a folder called "mesh" so maybe this contains the 3d models. If anyone can take a look at it that would be great, thank you very much.

Where is the problem? I can see assumed (DWord) FIs and vertices, so what?

Try DWORD for FIs - and use floats:

(The funny thing is the FVFsize which I expected to be 20 at a first glance.)

Thanks Durik! it works for the weapons, but is not working properly for creatures, wings, seems like the models with bones have this problem.  Im gonna attach more models, hope it helps
