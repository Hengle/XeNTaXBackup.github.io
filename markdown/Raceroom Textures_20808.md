- Post Title: Raceroom Textures

Hello everyone

Formerly there was a script that worked with quickbms and with which we could extract the DDS textures from the raceroom racing experience game.
However due to the new encryption of the files this script no longer works.
Does anyone know of a new script that works with this new encryption and with which we can extract the textures again?

Thanks in advance
