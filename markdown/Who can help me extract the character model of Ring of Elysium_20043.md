- Post Title: Who can help me extract the character model of Ring of Elysium?

I've read many posts.But I'm sorry I didn't get a useful solution.

Now I'm using translation software to talk to you. If there are grammatical mistakes, please forgive me.

I want to extract the character model of Ring of Elysium,But I don't know what tools to use.

I love the model in Ring of Elysium very much.The tools I've tried so far are NinjaRipper V1.7.1，But that doesn't seem to work for Steam games.

So my plan was hampered.

I hope to get help from some kind people.Thank you！

Are you able to find files with models and send them as samples, preferably 20 pieces ?

Yes, of course. Thank you very much for your reply. I have packaged and uploaded 20 files with models. I hope you can help me. I hope I can learn how to unpackage them.

Hi, my friend！

 I am very happy to see your private letter. I just spent some time registering Google Cloud Disk. 

This time I changed the link of Google Cloud Disk. I wonder if you can download it.
