- Post Title: Models stored in .r3e

Hello everyone, i am a 3d artist and a fan of a game called RF online, i know is old, but i love that game and want to revive a bit that game community offering them client mods to everyone, i managed to mod a lot of the client " textures mostly" but i am stuck beautifying the maps. This is where .r3e comes handy. r3e stands for R3 = proprietary engine rf online use, e= entity, used to populate with extra props solo or instances in the maps. Some .r3e files also store effects for particles, but i am only interested in the model part.

Hope i am not wrong with my theory about .r3e ^_^

Example file attached to post, if anyone is able with a script for blender or what else, i have no idea how it works, i will appreciate a lot. Thanks!
