- Post Title: Rocky Balboa .neo textures

Hello,

Rocky Balboa for PSP is a very interesting game and I'd like to rip the textures and models from it, but models are a different story right now..

Rocky Balboa works on the YETI Engine. I was able to use a QuickBMS script to decompress a .BIG file container into thousands of dats/wavs/etcs. Neo files are also included in the bunch. However, I haven't been able to convert them to a useable format. They *are* textures, as you can clearly see a picture of some sort in TExtureFinder.
