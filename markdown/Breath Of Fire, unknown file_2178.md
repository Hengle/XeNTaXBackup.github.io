Why is the rar called KP btw?
Nevermind actually.
I looked at them for a bit but I cant get ANYTHING from them, I threw them at STUNS, but because there only 1KB to begin with stuns just throws out a bunch of OTHER 1KB files, but in HEX EDITOR the bytes just say ".9KB5" OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT, only like 5 bytes in each file, Its mad.

Well i dont really know about programing stuff but from your said that was kind a difficult?To be honest, It looks like we may have to paly the waiting game, That is waiting for someone better then I, Ie: Mr Mouse, Strobe, Xela, John_Doe or any others to notice the ropic and lend a hand.
Of cours i guess you could PM them if oyu really wanted to.
But either way i cant PROMISE there would be any progress on these files.

First, maybe i should help you with saying..."where is the graphics?"

the largest files in this RAR file contains VAG data.
(noname3 and noname7)

and the smallest files doesnt seem to contain either Gfx or Audio! :X

The only possible file i see that can possibly contain graphics
would be noname8, but thats just because i havent found anything
that looks like Audio in it.


har har!
