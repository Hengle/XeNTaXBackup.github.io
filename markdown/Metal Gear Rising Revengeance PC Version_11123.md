Metal gear rising: revengeance.

Hello, I am wondering if anyone knows what support exists for the PC version of rising. You can use bayonetta tools or Noesis to extract the *.cpk files. This extracts a whole lot of *.dat files, but this is where other tools no longer work.

Here is the thread for the console versions working [viewtopic.php?f=16&t=10147](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=10147)

Use tools from me: [http://games-gen.com/soft/DTT2DDS.rar](http://games-gen.com/soft/DTT2DDS.rar) (DTT2DDS and DDS2DTT)
Or tools from flatz: [http://yadi.sk/d/ITWXXzuoFtZ7X](http://yadi.sk/d/ITWXXzuoFtZ7X) (Updated 18.01.2014 16:23 MSK)

Well, it seems to extract .dat perfectly fine, but now the wmb doesn't work with bayonetta tools, and this bxm tool is asking for options that dont seem to exist

I assume this might be a system language issue. But is there a way to make ddt2dds not report errors on invalid dtts, in order to not have the constant " is not a valid integer value error one gets on virtually every single dtt file in the various folder? So that one could process entire folders, without having to babysit it more or less
