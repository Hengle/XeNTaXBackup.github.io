- Post Title: PC Evolve .skin/.skinm model import maxscript

Hi guys! Here's maxscript to import Evolve .skin/.skinm model with bones+weights (3ds max 2009-2012). 
If anyone will find it useful that's cool  

P.S. Report bugs. Notice, that this is for rigged models only (enemy ,npc, chars, skinned weapons), static meshes will not work (levels, props) unless you rename them to .skinm files and skip bone import part (.skin file)

Updated script for new character - Sunny, maybe some other models too (thanks to TheMask85 for sample and bug-report), also script will load bone hierarchy (if it's present), to make your life much more easier
