i as out of curiosity (i know nothing of coding fyi) but i am curios,  since PS4 games are able to be data mined i would assume The Order: 1886 would be a possibility

Yes, it is.

Google for the decrypted PKG and you will find a place to download.
Extract it and you will have the files.

sweet, can you provide a link perhaps (i tried looking for a pkg but to no avail)

also, is there a way to extract the models, as i am trying to do, but i'd just like to know (like a blender or maxscript perhaps)

I really hope daemon finishes his tool.
The graphics are amazing and exporting entire levels would be top notch. :p
