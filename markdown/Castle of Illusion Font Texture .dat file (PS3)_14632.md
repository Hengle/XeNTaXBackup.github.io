- Post Title: Castle of Illusion Font Texture .dat file (PS3)

Hello everyone. I'm trying to open the texture to edit the font file of the game castle of illusion PS3 version, which seems to be a dds file dxt 5 with alpha channel and mip maps, but should be otherwise. Could someone check for me, thanks.

Yeah they look the the same to me, both dxt5 2048x2048 texture data, just the ps3 dat file has a custom header.
you might could jst edit the pc texture and copy the header from the ps3 file and overwrite the pc header with it.

OK, I'll make the changes that you indicated.

Thanks
