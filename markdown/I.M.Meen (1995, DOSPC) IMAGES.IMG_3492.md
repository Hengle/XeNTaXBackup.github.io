Each IMG file contained within a RES**.LAB file contains an image container data file, one of which seems to be the container for all textures.

Dunno if I'll ever be able to convert the graphics but it's a data container format. This may also contain enemy graphics.

Also, I decided to give this it's own thread because I rather split them up.

This is what I've found so far. Deeper in however are what seem to be sprites that do not meet the same height/width criteria. I wasn't too certain where to put this since it is a container of graphics, thus relative to an archive. But it also details the palette and stuff... not 100% sure.
