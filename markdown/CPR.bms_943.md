- Post Title: CPR.bms

MultiEx has trouble reading Port Royale 2 files (only reads first 96 in one file)...but... Dragon Unpacker 5 is able to read the cpr files with PR2.  I tried to export the cpr.bms from the binder tool, but I get runtime error 438: Object doesn't support this property or method... so ... how to proceed (perhaps a fresh cpr.bms I could work with?)  Thanks in advance.

Yes, it probably should be a fresh one. I will look into it.
