I never could really figure out where those gorgeous models used in Chaos Theory are stored and how come they haven't been ripped yet. Are they in Chaos Theory\System\Echelon.u or dynamic-pc.umd?... Does anyone have any idea how to extract them?

I'm glad you're asking about classic models, I would love to see some of these too.  Did you check Pandora Tomorrow at all?  I know it's on the UEViewer list, but in a limited capacity.  

I found a physical copy of PT, but I haven't had a chance to dig around in the files yet to verify if UEViewer was supposed to work with Xbox vs PC.  My former attempts to find the Xbox files failed, so I didn't revisit it yet.

Why can't you just ripped it with nR?

Meshes are either very distorted, or are impossible to edit or even import to Blender at all... I can only view the models in Noesis, 3DS Max, but when I try to manipulate them in 3Ds Max it just behaves extremely weird. 

I uploaded my rips [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/j2d3ibd4ki1tge9/Splinter%20Model%20Pack.rar?dl=0) and I wish good luck to anyone that can export it for use in Source Engine...

Then it means my rips are broken? I can't even tell anymore... Can you upload your models?

Do you mean Ninja Ripper? I'm not familiar with nR.

Does this mean static models are rippable, and does it have to be while the game is running instead of from the actual files?

All models that are captured on-screen with ninja ripper are ripped. Problem is that depending on the angle you ripped from ingame, the models will be slightly flat or deformed. I just have issues with the .rip format as the 3ds max plugin imports them just fine, but editing them is a pain in the ass. Noesis can also view and export them, however Blender cannot even open the exported .obj's or .smd's I create in 3ds max from the original .rip files. It's very frustrating and all I want to do is port these models to Garry's Mod. I reuploaded the file containing all ripped models here so people can see for themselves:

I ripped chaos theory characters just fine with nR (yes, it's ninja ripper). Only the normals are broken — just reset them with normal modifier within 3ds max.

p.s.: ripped models have full info including weight data — you can even build a full skeleton. Use GIMS ninja importer to load that data.
