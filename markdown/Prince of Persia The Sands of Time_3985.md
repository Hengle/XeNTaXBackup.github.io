Peaple even do not ask how much I was searchin some details, BUT JUST NOTHING.

With friends decided to translate so prosperous game - POP... and to begin it from the fisrt part in 3D - SOT

So I've used our friend's Turfster's Persian Rug and got all files from the POPData.BF file, which ones are
that domned files in .mft format - fonts, examples attached.

What I just not tried, but no results, hope remains on you...
I think there is also one more game with such like fonts - Disciples II, for which was written [.mft font viewer](http://d2ext.gmirs.ru/files/D2FontView.rar), but it doesn't works on ones from POP.

I made translation to PoP: Warrior Within, where is almost everything subtitled. In SOT and T2T, just the tutorial and the menu.
In popww (the modified JADE engine almost the same in the first 2 games), the fonts are in menu....bin files, the texts are in fd...bin files. The bin files are compressed, and no repacker. So you need to set the new filesize etc. And if you make 1! mistake, the game wont start. This is good and bad thing.
(I had 2 weeks to fix every problem, the translation was 2days with checking)

I can give you the font file from PoPWW - dds image. (I didn't search the SOT and T2T font editing mode)

Since my last post I made editors to popww (pc, ps2, xbox, GC file compatible, I couldn't extract the PSP .bf file). If you need, I can give you too, to translating the texts.
