- Post Title: CVM and CCS(CCSF) Archive File Help

I was hoping that I could get some assistance on an archive file type that I am working with. I cannot find any information on it anywhere so I would have to assume it's a proprietary format. If someone here could take a look at it and give me some suggestion on how to go about unpacking these files, or at least give me a starting point since I am new to this, I would very much appreciate it.

Attached is one of the CCS files that should contain model and texture information.

Again, Thanks for any help provided.

Here is one that may be a bit more simple to look at if it helps. I believe this CCS file only contains one BMP file in it.

Okay so I have been racking my head with trying to learn to extract from this format for the last few days and fear I may have shot myself in the foot from the beginning.

These CCS files started from an original Munge(Big File) a DATA.CVM on my ps2 game disk. The DATA.CVM had a header of ROFS which with some research I believe stands for a Read Only File System which I assume is an encryption method for the CVM. Now since I still have only learned how to search for LBAs to get the file structure of simple archives this is going to take a lot of time for me to learn how to get past encryption methods unless someone is willing to help me out that has a bit more knowledge than I do at the moment.

How I was able to get the CCS files in the first place was by using the ISOBuster recovery tool, but I am not sure if it exactly recovered the CCS files in the way they should be if extracted in the correct way. but again I am only at the beginning of learning to look at archive files.

At any rate if anyone wants to look at the full CVM file let me know and I will upload it somewhere for you. I would appreciate any assistance anyone can give, I really want to crack the CVM's ROFS format as well as the CCS archive files inside.

If not I will keep people updated as I slowly move forward with this and pray that I don't run into a roadblock that I am unable to handle.

Well at this point it is safe to say I just don't get it. I have spent a load of hours over the last week searching through the endless sea of Hex trying to find patterns, sizes, I think a few times I may have come across a recognizable header, but none with a that had a address that would point to it so I could try and make an LBA table. I have been through guide after guide and while I have learned loads about simple archive formats, none of it has put me any closer to breaking through these archive files.

I have no choice really but to hope some one will help me, heck even give me a step in the right direction would be a nice change a pace rather than trying to do this on my own with minimal information to pull from. I have asked on a few other forums sent e-mails to people who take requests, but nada. I understand people have lives and are quite busy and I can accept that, so I will just leave it at this.

When or if someone who can do this has time, please get in touch with me via the boards e-mail or messenger. I would seriously appreciate any information anyone can give that can at least put me on the right track. This whole going around in circles not knowing if I am taking the right steps is a bit demotivating.

I felt the need to look more into the CVM file today since I was not even sure if ISOBUSTER recovered the CCS files in full. At anyrate I found some information that maybe useful for anyone who helps me and for anyone else who runs into the this method of Compression\Encryption.

I posted where I though it most appropriate.
