- Post Title: .BVH to .VMD

Does anyone know how to convert a .bvh file to .vmd (VocaloidMotionData)without using LiveAnimation?
Exporting from Blender to .vmd would be ideal.
Are there any ways to do so?
Sorry if I've posted this in an inappropriate section

However, in order for the application to run you must have at least corresponding names for the feet and head bones, because that's how the application calculates the model height and it will produce an NullPointerException and fail if it can't. You may also need the latest versions of Javascript, both 64 and 32(x86) bit.

It's a Javascript based converter. 
To convert BVH>VMD using this, you unzip the b-momi folder, open up a command line at the b-momi folder(shift+click the folder in explorer>"open command window here" in windows) and enter the command

b-momi.bat -bvh bvhname.bvh -map bonemapname.txt

Obviously, replace "bvhname" and "bonemapname" with the file names you're using.

The bone map is a text file that maps the bone names in the BVH file to MMD's bone names. Or, that's it's purpose, you can use whatever names you want. However, in order for the application to run you must have at least corresponding names for the feet and head bones, because that's how the application calculates the model height and it will produce an NullPointerException and fail if it can't.
