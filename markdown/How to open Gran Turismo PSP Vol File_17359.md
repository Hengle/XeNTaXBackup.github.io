- Post Title: How to open Gran Turismo PSP Vol File??

Hello everyone, I like to search stuff in videogames, and after find a proper way to load all the hidden tracks in the game, I want to go on and try to open the vol file of this game, because I think there's surely something hidden.
But here's the main problem : there's no way to open this file! 
Every GT vol opener won't work, hex editor gives weird characters, and use Cheat Engine to search stuff doesn't help at all.
Does any application exists which can make this file to open ? Even some Hex Editor which allows to explore archive files and see inside them.
