- Post Title: Games to extract maps/environments from

I went through the sticky up up there but that seemed to be about 3D models in general.

I prefer background objects like terrain and architecture, and having a large variety of them would allow me to put together all sorts of random things.

Maybe we can compile a list of games where maps can be extracted and imported to an editor? This would most likely be a small subset of games listed in the stickied thread.

I've gotten maps from Crisis Core and Dissidia so far, but that's it. Hoping to get more stuff to work with!

Surely backgrounds and landscapes are just general models..  if its possible to rip a main character from a game it should also be possible to rip the backgrounds and level parts from the same game.  its not very often  you have 2 different model formats in the same game. so i don't see why a separate list would be needed.

Probably, but I was going through threads like dynasty warrior 7 and although the models were ripped, none of the maps were.
And some games probably don't even store the maps as models, or maybe just have a million pieces and puts it together somehow. I was going through some MMO's and couldn't get any maps at all. They probably aren't even stored on the client side.
