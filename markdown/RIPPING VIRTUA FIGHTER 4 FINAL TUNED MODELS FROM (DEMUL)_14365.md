Hello everyone, am a noob at ripping so i need a little help to get these models.. I been looking for vf models on the web but can't found any of them.But the dead or alive 5 version models, so first i tried ripping for pcsx2 vf4 evolution using 3d ripper dx,texmod and ninja ripper it was a fail, but i would get the textures. The only problem would be the colors would be wrong, just to much work.. Then i remembered that a secret version dreamcast 2 and vf4 came out, called final tuned on emulator. Now ripping from demul is easy i had success with all the ripping tools i used on pcsx2. The best tools so far is the ninja ripper,there's just 2 problems so far,the 1st is after ripping then opening 3dsmax 2010 or 2012 (they both work),then using the ninja importer script to layout the vertex groups by texture number. The stage comes out just fine with all its textures, but the fighter models would be layed down on top of each other??
With no order why..

Hello, ELEMENTFORCE2000.
The topic is very interesting.  
Please tell me which version you use Demul?
Which settings need to be done in order to capture the geometry Demul using Ninja Ripper?

Did you manage to successfully rip the models with correct scale or flat models? With ninja ripper I'm keep getting flat model due to demul not having stereoscopic graphic plugin like nullDc had.

Ok, im back at it again, this time i found a few tools and plugins to help me get these models. ninjaripper plugins for noesis and blender came in good use but they still don't solve my problem. Noesis show the models with textures but the models are in pieces still arggghhh, blender show models but no textures why is this soo hard???  Ok back to 3dripper agian you get the whole stage and models but the textures just will not save in the same folder. So i came up with a solution am not that good with 3ds max but a learn basic use of things like materials and texturing. So i color each difuse part of the model a different color so i would know what texture map go were by color! OH THIS IS DEMUL32 0.5.6 AND DEMUL057, BUT I USE THE 1ST ONE

Since i all ready have textues from ninjaripper, i'll open up blender because i know more about texture mapping in blender, also i exported the model from 3ds max in a 3ds file. Blender has a plugin  for 3ds  import then i go to work on textures only problem know is poses the model in tpose.

I need someone who knows how to use cheat engine to find the tpose animation so the ripping can be right. AT the end of the day the only good  ripping tool is 3dripper so far.

How did you rip the models with correct scale? I tried by using demul0.5.6 and 3dripper, but still flat models.
Does it need any special tools or plugins? 
By using this way we can rip the models from other NAOMI roms,it is right?
