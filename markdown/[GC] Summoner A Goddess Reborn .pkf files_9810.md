- Post Title: [GC] Summoner: A Goddess Reborn .pkf files

I'm searching for some information of unused items but most of the files are compressed with a non-standard lzma (at least I think so because I couldn't extract any container), every item has such a file containing at least one .tga texture and some sort of .tpl file.

Can somebody look into it or suggest how I can unpack these files anyway?
