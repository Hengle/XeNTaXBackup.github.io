I'm sorry for my complete ignorance here, it's more of a question..

Some Wii U games are being shared already in the hopes of a homebrew or the wii U key, having these games ripped to a PC (ISO) means nothing at all?

I have the files, but I'm not good at exporting them.   
I would love to make Ouse (human) and Ren's best friend, but I can't get it.
