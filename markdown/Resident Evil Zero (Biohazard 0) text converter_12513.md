- Post Title: Resident Evil Zero (Biohazard 0) text converter

Since the [ALZ algorithm in RE0 has finally been figured out](http://hcs64.com/mboard/forum.php?showthread=36979&showpage=3), the raw data of lots of files can finally be viewed. This has allowed me to write a converter for the text in the game. It is a Python script so you will need Python to run it. The reason for the enormous filesize of it is because each release has different character mappings, so there's a character mapping table for each release within it.

You must decompress A/LZ files before passing them to the script, as it does not decompress.

If you find any errors or something that could be improved, please let me know.
