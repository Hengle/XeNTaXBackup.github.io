- Post Title: Cars Race-O-Rama Wii Characters .obj files

A couple days ago I started ripping .obj files for Cars Race-O-Rama for the Wii using Dolphin & 3D Ripper DX, focusing on some of the playable characters. Right now, I have no idea how to turn them into the right dimentions. I'm new at this.

Edit: I got the models ready, now I just need to know how to get the textures in.

Do you still have the models? I may be able to help with the textures.
