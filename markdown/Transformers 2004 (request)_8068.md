- Post Title: Transformers 2004 (request)

Hi everyone!  I have a request to make, if it's not too much to ask.  Im wondering if someone could please rip Megatron, Cyclonus and Tidal Wave from the Transformers 2004 game for PS2:  [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transforme ... ideo_game)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformers_%282004_video_game%29)

If anyone needs more info on which characters they are, I can post in this topic.  I really hope someone here can do this, I've been searching for a method forever and my searches led me to this forum.  Ive wanted these models for quite awhile and it is very very much appreciated
