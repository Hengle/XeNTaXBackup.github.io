This may sound funny. but you can use the "ArchiveTool.exe"
located in the root folder of Titan Quest to unpack the archives.

for example, place ArchiveTool.exe , zlib.dll, inside resources directory.
and run 

archivetool Underground.arc -extract "e:\game\titanquest\resources"

if your game is located at e:\game\titanquest, else change it to
the correct path, or else it wont work. but thats about it
