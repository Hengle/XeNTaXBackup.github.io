- Post Title: Strike Suit Zero DC - decompile level file

Hi guys.
I succeeded in extracting and decompiling about everything in this game... except for the level files.

I've attached an example. If anyone knows how, please tell me. 
Many thanks!!!

I'm not having much luck with this one...
I suppose the compression or compiling decryption is not known...
