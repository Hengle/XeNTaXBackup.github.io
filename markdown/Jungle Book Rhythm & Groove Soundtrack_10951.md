- Post Title: Jungle Book Rhythm & Groove Soundtrack

Hi guys.

I've been trying to pull the soundtrack of this for a while, since it's actually pretty catchy. It has some neat covers of Bare Necessities and I want to be like you.

I've figure out that the audio is contained in BLK files. I can open them in MFaudio but everything's messed up, obviously. I tried Snakemeat's tutorial on finding the offset for the interleave, and I've had no luck with that. I've also tried VGMStream and that doesn't seem to work either. Looking for something that can break apart .BLK files lead me to Biohazard tool, but I didn't find .BLK in all of its menus and it seems that was specifically within Driver.

Here are some samples if anyone wouldn't mind helping me out with this:

Thanks so much!
