- Post Title: Quick Question about QuickBMS

Hey everybody, ive just used quickbms and i found it very nice as a binary layered extractor.  but i have i quick question, i know that luigi is not making a compiler for quickbms, but is there anyway to compile it back again using quickbms which is very wrong because quickbms is made to be an extractor, if it is not possible. then are there any tools to compile these game files back?

thank you to whomever answers this

Well, Aluigi was busy implementing a rudimentary support for that in QuickBMS. 

MultiEx Commander (MexCom) allows you to do what you want for a large number of game archive formats already. MexCom uses MexScript (the "original BMS" (tm) ) and plugins, and many formats are also supported for file importation. Also, a new release of MultiEx Commander is planned that will implement EasyMod, the ability to create a stand-alone mod of game archives that you can distribute. 

MultiEx Commander has been able to import files back into archives since it's DOS time (1997)
