- Post Title: Persona 4 Arena - .hip format

Currently, there are some .hip in the game that work with the previous tools released for BB and a few other Arcsys games, as well as the QuickBMS script to extract them. However, there are also some files that are .hip, but seem to be unopenable with hipster and they don't extract properly with the Arcsys bms script. If anyone could take a look at these, I packed both an openable .hip and its .pac, as well as a non-openable .hip with its .pac. Also hipster just incase it is needed for some reason.
