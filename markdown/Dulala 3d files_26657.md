3d Unity game with unencrypted metadata and encrypted .data, some of which load an image but cannot preview/export. 
The unity .pkg in apk also looks different than files from in-game.
in game file data, dump.cs [https://mega.nz/folder/56BC1TAJ#QSKPlU85V2oDreSasLhYZA](https://mega.nz/folder/56BC1TAJ#QSKPlU85V2oDreSasLhYZA) 
(apk from [https://www.biligame.com/detail/?id=109958](https://www.biligame.com/detail/?id=109958)) 
all data is downloaded at launch, but I can provide an account if needed

Alternative english title for the game is "Go Lala Go". The package format is quite interesting, kind of archive with each entry consists of preuso unity bundle header and entry can be any file (actual bundle, audio file, etc) - which is implementation of PhysFS. Last entry in archive is index with obfuscated names (probably xored), wrapped in the same way. But even if you'll extract bundles, part of the header is obfuscated along with paths in directoryinfo, and data chunks are zstd compressed with dictionary, while some chunks are marked as uncompressed, but they seem like fully encrypted.

The following script can extract separate entries from pkg archives as-is (index is ignored though). It may be useful for at least audio package, since files are not additionally obfuscated there.
