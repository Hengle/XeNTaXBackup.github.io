It would be easier to just get the name of the songs (shown ingame) and find a place to buy/stream them  

If you want to hear your own music, put the ingame music off and play your music with media player in the background...

25 life sound files is *.ogg when renamed *.emt

you can rename emt to ogg and then play or convert with softwares when support ogg files
