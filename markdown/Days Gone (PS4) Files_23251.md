- Post Title: Days Gone (PS4) Files

Hello! I am trying to find a way to export Day Gone's 3D menu map as a 2D image. 

I've been told to use [Gildur's UE Viewer](https://www.gildor.org/en/projects/umodel) to extract the models/textures and then run a script to stitch the texture images together. But, I have no idea what/where the original file is that I'm supposed to put into Gildur's UE Viewer...

Any help?
