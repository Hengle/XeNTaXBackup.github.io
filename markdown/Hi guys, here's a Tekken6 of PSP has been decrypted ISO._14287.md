Hi guys, here's a Tekken6 of PSP has been decrypted ISO file, you can use HEX tools to find a lot of 'GZIP' ASCII character in this ISO, you can't find any like 'gzip' ASCII character in the past, because it's has been decrypted, it's true.

I just wanna get your help, to help me to decompress there gzip files out, and compress those again, somebody can help me please?  

Sorry my poor English.

Try using VGM Toolbox's GZIP compress/decompress feature.

[Download VGM Toolbox here](https://sourceforge.net/projects/vgmtoolbox/)

The GZIP decompress can be found under:

VGMToolbox > Misc. Tools > Compression Tools > GZIP Compress/Decompress

Just drag and drop one of those files onto the VGMToolbox window
