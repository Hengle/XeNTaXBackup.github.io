Tool has been updated. Drag the .pak file on PakDecrypter.exe and wait. File will convert as .zip file.

Heyo,

I found this tool just a moment ago and tried it on both Star Citizen Evolve. Sadly PAKs from Evolve get "converted" to ZIP files with a size of 0 KB.

Might be there a chance for an update?
