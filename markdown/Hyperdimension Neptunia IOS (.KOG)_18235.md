So, Good news and bad news - First off is I've been able to actually get a hold of a preserved download link of the English version of the App. The bad news is... All these file extensions save for one of them are unknown. 

TEST SAMPLE - WARNING: LOUD

all_pk.kog seems to be where I presume all of the basic assets are included in, While the stray CAF files that were included within the app archive are actually importable into Audacity (although demonic and ear-rapingly loud) I can clearly make out voices, They seem to be the "Nep Alarm" function in particular and played when your phone was in sleep mode. Does anybody know how to open up the allpaks directory in that case? Because I assume a few other files like this are hidden in there somewhere. I imported it into Audacity and I swear here and there I can make out very inaudiable sped-up voices.

Was imformed that my links were broken due to the post being copied and pasted. 

Here's a link to the archive for anybody who wants to take a crack at it: [http://www.mediafire.com/file/5zckl4ba3 ... nepios.zip](http://www.mediafire.com/file/5zckl4ba3kqnr7j/nepios.zip)
