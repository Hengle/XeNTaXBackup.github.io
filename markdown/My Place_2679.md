I thought to open a thread with some snaps of people's computer rooms/places. So we can picture them sitting there when they post here . 

To start off with, here's three of my base in 2002. 

One snapshot I had taken for a PC games website (cleaned up). 

This was in March 2002. The other snapshots are from May 2002. Those display more the natural habitat at the time.   I'm sure I'm not the only one whose "offices" at home look like that. Anyway, I had a small network at the time, with one computer acting as firewall/server (P75) and two others to work on (AMD 450 + Geforce 1, and a Pentium 800 + Geforce 2).  

You may also notice the Commodore Amiga (600) on top of the firewall's monitor in the May pictures. Across the room (not on the pictures) you would find another desk with a Commodore 64 set + TV.  

Perhaps I'll come up with new snaps of my current room  .

Hehe, nice pics. So you've got two systems there ready to start-up ? What's in them (hardware) ?

It looks rrreally tidy compared to my previous set-up (scroll up) and my current one (will make some pictures tonight). I'm now in the attic of our new house, and we've only recently moved in there, and attics are for, well mess. And so it looks like. But the next home project of mine will be "clear up the f*cking attic". 

So, you've just moved in with your girlfriend huh? You're a man, so you naturally you don't see the need to make a room "homey". Trust me, now that you've moved in with your girlfriend, you will soon see the need. Or indeed: *her* need.   (I've lived together for years now, talking from experience hehe).

Ah, and so I see assumptions are mostly wrong. Anyway, so it's a woofer, but should that not be on the ground for the bass effect? 

Ah.... those student days...you should cherish them. Mine were great! 

WTF is up with all those pricks playing Jack The Ripper in London, by the way???

kinda off-topic on a matter that's off-topic on the thread itself...

well not the original Jack, its about a murderer in NY that murders some prostitutes in disturbing ways and all of that, I have the game, if you want I can extract stuff from it and we'll all have jack the ripper avatars

That's my main computer, my video recording computer and one of my trusty C64s ready to go (with MMC replay + RR NET plugged in, connecting in to my LAN).

Very nice, and much cleaner than some of the other pictures!  BTW, what website is that, out of curiosity? It's a Dutch-language site, isn't it? (at least, that's what it looks like from the title...)
