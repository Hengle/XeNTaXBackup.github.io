- Post Title: Dark Vampires: The Shadow Of Dust "Decryptor"

Incidently flung open, here is a "decryptor" for this game:
[http://wolfgroup.de/neuheiten.htm](http://wolfgroup.de/neuheiten.htm)
There is a file named "data.v", which is actually a ZIP-file XORed with 55h.
Get a XOR-tool like this: [http://aluigi.altervista.org/mytoolz/xor.zip](http://aluigi.altervista.org/mytoolz/xor.zip)
or use the simple attached tool.
[DATAV.ZIP](https://xentaxbackup.github.io/file/2033_DATAV.ZIP)
