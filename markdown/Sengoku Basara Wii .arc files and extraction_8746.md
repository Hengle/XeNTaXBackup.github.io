- Post Title: Sengoku Basara Wii .arc files and extraction

Hey Guys. I'm having trouble trying to rip these game models out, they're in .arc format and it seems all the tools out there wont work. (I know, this game is OLD) but still, I really want the models! > 3<
I already encountered this post: [viewtopic.php?t=5252&f=16](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?t=5252&f=16), used QuickBMS and recieved no results in ripping them. Please Help! Thanks you

you can use Noesis to extract the files, and brresviewer to view/convert them.

after extracting the contents of the arc files in Noesis, youll find a bunch of tex and mod files open those in Brres viewer
