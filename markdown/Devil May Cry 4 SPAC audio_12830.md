- Post Title: Devil May Cry 4 SPAC audio

Hi!
Greetings to the members of this forum.

I need help for the voice files from the devil may cry 4 contained in:
ARC_uPlayerNero\sound\se\player\pl000 

it seems that the voices are probably in the spac files 
(Similar to spac files for RE6)

there is very little information on this topic, and all the tools that can help
to extract spac .. links are dead (if someone has a tool SPC Tool v2.0 please 
him to send it to me or give an correct link)

or advise any way how you can bring these files for use?
