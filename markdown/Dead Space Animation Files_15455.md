- Post Title: Dead Space Animation Files

(First off, if this is not the right sub-forum for this, any mod who sees this feel free to move it to the right sub-forum, thanks!)

I am looking for people who could convert these animation files into viewable variants that can be then applied to models from Dead Space 1-3.

I will provide instances from the 3 games here:

(I put the Brute from Dead Space and Dead Space 2 as well as the Fodder from Dead Space 3 in there along with their corresponding models, textures, skeleton and presumably the animation files.

For the skeleton to be opened, you need this script for 3D Max:

Preferably, I'd like to have a tool or something that can then be used on all the models from the games.

Thanks in advance.
