Sorry for resurrecting an old thread, but can vfs files be repacked (or is there a way to get the game to use them)?
Also, the DLC (Jungle Hunt) uses a new vfs file called "dlc00.vfs", can that be supported too (since I have the game, I can give it to whomever is interested taking a look at it)?

Thank you very much. So as of now, there is no way to make the game use the unpacked files, right (since there is no repack)?

Well here my simple packer.



And small test with edited language file



1.) Run VFS Unpacker
2.) Unpack files
3.) Edit files (Dont rename __Unknown folder and filenames inside)
4.) Run VFS Packer
5.) Select directory with unpacked files
6.) Select output VFS file
7.) Press Build
8.) Profit

Enjoy

Ekey, does your packer have command line keys? 
OneTwo means that he re-pack game resources for best compression. And in installation process all resources must be packed into original in silent mode, automatically.

1) Game not using compression
2) In Gui version exactly the same operations like in console (Select dir, select output archive, press build = done)

Anyway i dont want rewrite packer to console version.
