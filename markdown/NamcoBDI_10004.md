- Post Title: NamcoBDI

In the Nacmo.BDI (Found in Tales of the World 3 and Tales of Hereos), there's a header which reads "EZBIND". There's a QMS script that can extract files from ENZBIND but in the NacmoBDI there's multiple EZBIND headers. The BMS script seems to only extract the first EZBIND chunk and not the others. Is there a way to split the file at every EZBIND header? I'm trying to get the MDL, ANI and PPT files inside the NacmoBDI file. The NacmoBDI tools by CriticalError only extracts the .at3 files which I do not need. If anyone has any solution, let me know. 

The only way for me to split is by hand and the NamcoBDI file is over 900MB.
