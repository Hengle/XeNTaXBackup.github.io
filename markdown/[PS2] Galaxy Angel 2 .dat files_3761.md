Hi, I've cracked about 80% for both GAI and GAII games (all games in the series).

What is it that you're looking for? Movies, Games, or images? It would help more if you answered this.

It seems to me that actually 7/8 dats have files:

...dats you should not be interested in:
ADV and ADVMAT contains program files to run the ADV mode. (The talking faces and response selection)

...dats to look at:
SLG contains program and data files to run the SLG mode. (The battle simulation)
ALL contains tables and image files. (This file contains all the images.)
STRM contains all music file headers. (.mih headers)
STRM_R contains all music and voice files (Music=.mib Voice=1 file of .vag files).
STRM_R2 contains all cutscene movies.

...and IDX is just a list of all the files stored in those archives above.

You can use the RobotWarsPSP plugin with the MultiEX Commander program to extract files from some of the archives. If it doesn't work, you will have to do it manually with a Hex Editor. All dats are uncompressed.

I'm mainly looking for the scripts and graphic files. 

I'll try using the RobotWarsPSP plugin to see if I can find these files. Thanks.
