There's one simple thing a civilized requester should ever know: upload a sample. Unless you decided to leave it to chance that someone happens to know an existing tool that can do the things for you, which, if worked, would be a total waste of forum resources since you could have used Google. I supposed the days of silence on this topic should had taught you that.
