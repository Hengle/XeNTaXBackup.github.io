- Post Title: Help with Outlive resource files

Hello...
I'm trying to make a mod from a game called Outlive.
This game have one file that contains the resources (Outlive.dat).

I already extracted successfully the resources (look the print):


I need help to edit resources of this game...
I used the Trid program to scan some files, some of them are edited with a program called "Lumena Paint" (I could not find on the Internet). 

First, I need to know how extract the file "Campaign", which contains no extension... This file appears to be a container for files from the campaign of this game. The same to "Sound" file. The Trid program could not find the extension of these two files.

Links: 
Campaign file: [http://jumbofiles.com/ybm0662pgrrz](http://jumbofiles.com/ybm0662pgrrz)
Sound file: [http://jumbofiles.com/e7c2agtsl8zf](http://jumbofiles.com/e7c2agtsl8zf)

PS: This game is in Portuguese...
PS 2: Sorry my English, if there are any errors.

Any help is welcome.
Thanks
Daniel.
