I’m interested in porting too. But the textures don't work.     I wanted to port scenes.

Hello there. It seems PC PARC archives for characters were encoded. Is there updated quickBMS script to unpack them? Thanks.

I am also unable to extract the .par for the steam versions of Judgment and Lost Judgment.
Is there any way to get it to work?
When I run quickbms parc.bms I get the following error.
(The pars are extracted normally in Yakuza6, etc.).

signature of 4 bytes at offset 0x00000000 doesn't match the one
  expected by the script:

  this one: "nX"
  01 6e 58 e4                                       .nX.

  expected: "PARC"
  50 41 52 43                                       PARC
