- Post Title: Problems importing .MDL files from Neptunia Virtual Stars

Hi,

I got the game from Steam, discovered that it was made with the same engine as MNVIIR and also unpacked the archive files including the textures and the cl3 .

The problem that i'm having are the .mdl files that i imported in blender with these script :

I keep getting this error  :

Is there any way to import these strange .mdl files from the game in either Noesis and Blender?
