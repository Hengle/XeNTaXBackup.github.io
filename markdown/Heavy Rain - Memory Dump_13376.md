- Post Title: Heavy Rain - Memory Dump

Hi, I made a memory dump of Heavy Rain on PS3. Noticed all previous projects with this game ceased shortly and nobody had ever made any progress. Can any 3D model (Or maybe even texture) data be extracted from this?

Oops, that's embarrassing. Should work now.

You can easily find meshes by searching for "00 00 00 01 00 02 00" as hex
File's a bit big so it doesn't load into hex2obj entirely so I had to cut it up but they load fine otherwise.
