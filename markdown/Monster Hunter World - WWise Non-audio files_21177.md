- Post Title: Monster Hunter World - WWise Non-audio files

Hello, I'm trying to mod entirely new sounds (as in, not replacing any in the files) in Monster Hunter World, and everything I could gather about WWise tells me I should look for a SoundBanksInfo.xml, but that does not seem to exist within the game's files. There are, however, many other types of WWise-related files within the game, and I was wondering if anyone here had any more information about these files, and if any of them could be used for what I'm trying to do.
