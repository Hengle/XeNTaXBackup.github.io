- Post Title: help, text of Kamigokuto: Mary Skelter extraction

Hi guys, my english is terrible so i used google translate. I want to extract the text of this PSvita game Kamigokuto: Mary Skelter, but I can't export it normally, I observed that it may be encrypted or compressed, but I don't know how to solve this problem.
