- Post Title: ripping a ed model from a webpage

Hello to all of you rippers out there!

My problem might be a little bit different to the ones usually apearing on the forum but none the less Im hoping you guys might be able to help me out .

Basically there is this site heroforge.com. It allows you to create your own custom tabletop RPG miniatures. I was thinking : If I can see a 3D model right there on my browser, then there must be a way for me to get this mesh on my PC and print it on my own. So far I havent found a way to do it. I was wondering if any of you could offer some assitance

But can you confirm, they are free available, "for nothing"? If 'no', then follow the rules.  
(Maybe you'll get them after you've registered?)

The normal textures are easy to be found, anyway - maybe you know it:

Yes I was able to find the textures as well   
But the question remains .... is there really a way to get the mesh it's self ???

I have bought from this site several times, the reason I am searching for the mesh is to print a big version of my character that the site doesnt provide.

If any of you has any insight regarding my brain squashing problem I would be willing to make you my God for all eternity!

man that was 2 years ago   ,i don't think it works like that anymore.
anyway if you use firefox you can just use this
[https://www.nirsoft.net/utils/mozilla_cache_viewer.html](https://www.nirsoft.net/utils/mozilla_cache_viewer.html)
if you use chrome use this
[https://www.nirsoft.net/utils/chrome_cache_view.html](https://www.nirsoft.net/utils/chrome_cache_view.html)

edit
they are ckb files now in the url, titled "2.5.7" in ChromCacheView. 
for example

As Gepejantes said, they are easily ripped with ninjaripper, but sadly only with a T-pose. Someone suggested trying GLIntercept with the OGLE extension, but Ive been too stupid to get that to work so far.

Since you considered he was kidding you, then why even bother to ask?
Always watch your attitude when you ask people for help. We don't owe you nothing.

BTW, if you can only catch it as in T-pos, that means the model is skinned/rigged. 
And I don't think someone would appear much interests in extracting the bones/animations simply for several models. 

But you may, if you want to. It's up to you. Good luck.

Please make clear, I did not mean to offer any help.  Instead, I simply left you with two options: 
either to learn everything and do it yourself, or just give it up. I believe the latter would definitely be easier for you.

Probably you should ask more politely.

First of all I do not speak English fluently. I started Quietly asking someone to help us extract posing miniatures from heroforge and Acewell replied with something that does not work talking about Hex2obj for using ckb files ... Than Bigchillghost says his opinion for my simple "are you kidding all of us?" pulling in the conversation for no reason and not helping anyone in the resolution of the thread. I told him that his speech was useless and he gave me stupid, vain and I do not know what else after having even advised me to surrender, disrespecting my interests as if I were the last of the losers. Now am I to apologize? Ok I apologize. Now arrives Godblade1 showing a public model from heroforge? I repeat: are you really kidding us all? Funny...

Is there any competent person who can help the community to extract posing models from [www.heroforge.com](http://www.heroforge.com)? All we got is:
1 ninja ripper works only for T-pose
2 in cache files we found ckb files but seems nothing cannot convert ckb files to obj files (only Acewell knows how to do it)
3 Acewell doesn't respond for the moment
4 Bigchillghost can't help, he will tell you: "Give up, you're an idiot and blablabla"
5 Godblade1 has got only public model trying to send us all out of the way

Any new updates in 2019? I am a COMPLETE novice but while clarifying some of the holes in my knowledge on this area, it seems as though everyone is wondering how to convert .ckb files to .obj files, but isn't .ckb used for audio files? If so I cannot see how it would be possible for that to be converted into any visual programs (Correct me if I'm wrong). Is it an issue that the cache program is designed to only download audio and it takes any other data and converts it into extensions used to hold audio?

They might be using any format and they encode it to .ckb (or they just put .ckb at the end to throw people off). I think the only way to make sure is to inspect the javascript code that processes those files.

I think it is not possible to get a posed mesh using a program like ninja ripper. As far as I know, those programs intercept the data sent to the GPU and record that data. For rigged meshes, the final computed vertex positions are computed in the GPU (after the data is received); that's why you only get the T-pose.

In order to get the posed meshes you would need to get the data from javascript (before it is sent to the GPU). They are most likely using THREE.js library to load and render meshes, so it is only left to figure out how the geometries of the objects are represented in memory and export that in a format of your choice.

Keep in mind that in order to get a fully printable mesh it's a bit more complicated than that. A character contains multiple .ckb files, each representing a part of the character (head, body, ..). You would have to do a [boolean union operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_operations_on_polygons) between all meshes. This can be done in most CAD software.

Hey Gepejantes!

We encourage you to purchase your models directly from our website. This helps support our artists who work hard to create fresh content for the community on a regular basis.

The STL's only cost $4.97 however you can save 15% using code XENTAX to make things even more affordable.

Hopefully this helps   

Aubree

Hello people. If you really want these models for free, you can simply photoscan them using something like photoscan. Just save the screenshots in Heroforge and import masks from alpha. Of course, if you can get these models in T-pose it's probably easier to just pose them yourself with something like zbrush (since you don't need to make a rig), Because you will have to make alot of screenshots to get a better quality photoscan.
This is the small test I did:


Oh and I also found a heroforge ckb parser ([https://github.com/REDxEYE/HeroForge_parser](https://github.com/REDxEYE/HeroForge_parser)). Tried it, didn't work for me (I just ran the heroforge.py file with a downloaded ckb file). Maybe someone else will have better luck

Hey, until the heroforge 2.0 update I was simply using this obj exporter ([https://gist.github.com/jcarletto27/35b ... d78413f88d](https://gist.github.com/jcarletto27/35b19f811c657ec73b0238d78413f88d)) and everything worked with pose and all, but after the update the resulting model is either T pose (if commenting the bones code) or a complete mess

I successfully created a ripper capable of ripping with poses, but the models used in the hero editor are lower resolution than the one you get from buying the download.

Most of the details are baked in the textures, this chain mail is a good example:

[edit]
But this whole thread is against the rules, just wanted to say it is possible, but you won't get better results than this, since the hi-res models are not publicly available.

Could you extract the UV texture directly from the site and use them to add the texture to the model ? Also how did you achieve to extract them without the model looking like it exploded ? Just a hint in the right direction would be nice

I guess, the uvs are available, so some sort of estimate could be produced. First, you'll have to up the resolution of the mesh, maybe through subdivision, then use the uvs to displace the mesh, maybe simple by using the normals.

But you have to ask yourself if it is worth it? It might be possible, but is it feasible? And in the end, you won't get as good a model. 

I wrote the script to be able to move the axe he is holding 'up' so he is holding in the actual handle. But I still paid for the model but got disappointed/surprised when I saw the lower resolution.

I'm sure someone else also will make a ripper available, I won't. Again, I just wanted to make it clear that you could only get the low res model, before someone else attempts to make a ripper expecting good results.

It is worth it when you cant afford 8$ for one single model  Considering the fact that you can get a patreon for 10$ a month and get like 20 models its also quite expensive for a single model..

Hey there. I have a very similar issue with some item positions. Can you hit me up with a private message?

So I made an account just to ask how people got ninjaripper to work for t-pose models. I'm looking for the t-pose model but the newest version of ninjaripper and firefox (also tried chrome) doesn't work. I also tried ninjaripper 1.6 and firefox ver 47 like someone mentioned but its unsupported on heroforge. Could someone walk me through how to rip the t-pose and, hopefully, textures?

Did someone has find a way to get the moddels with pose and/or texture, or at least some kind of ambient oclusion map? I've used a scrip called Herosaver that works kinda nicely and I could export the .Stl file from heroforge, but it still on t-pose and some objects like the eyes, weapons and some clothes are weirdely placed (but can be reajusted in blender or another 3d editing software)

Here is the link for the script and instructions of how to use it, just open the chrome dev console and paste the code, then it should automaticaly start the download
[https://notnullgames.github.io/Herosaver/](https://notnullgames.github.io/Herosaver/)
And the github link if you're interested
[https://github.com/hero-saver/threejs](https://github.com/hero-saver/threejs)

Also there is the moddel that I could extract with herosaver, and on the right is the moddel that hakon has somehow extracted with the correct pose

Keep zoom and you will find the 3D t-posed model. but the Body size, eyes and others elements don't match the character.

Some news? or updates or herosaver?

Someone who understand Json files need to review the original code. Hero Forge changed the way the site fetch the mesh and poses. They got the subreddit for hero saver shut down so i cant track down any of the original developer..

What do you mean by "Keep Zoom?" I'm also just getting a cube, and I don't know how to "keep zoom" in order to fix it. Help please?

Delete the cube and keep zooming in and you will find a T-pose model
