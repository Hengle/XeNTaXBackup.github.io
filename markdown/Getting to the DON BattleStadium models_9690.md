- Post Title: Getting to the DON BattleStadium models

Hello Xentax! Time to come out of my lurker status. Just wanted to say how helpful this forum has been for me, thanks to everyone's helpful posts around here.

I had a question regarding a specific game, DON BattleStadium, and how to get to the model files, the DFF and TXD files of the PS2 version to be more specific. Initially I had tried my Gamecube version, the DFF & TXDs were easy enough to find in the games directories but those weren't compatible with Mario's script so that was out of the question. I noticed that someone had actually managed to successfully convert the models from the PS2 version here, [viewtopic.php?f=16&p=50878#p50878](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=16&p=50878#p50878) proving it's possible, so I investigated the PS2 version for the model files but I've had a bit of difficulty finding them, in contrast of the GC version. I was wondering if anybody knew how to get to them?

Here's an image of the root of the PS2 Disc of Battlestadium.



Now what essentially caught my eye was the DATA.afs which one would naturally think that's where the model files are at, so I extracted the contents of it via Noesis, and got a bunch of .raw files and some unknown file types with the words char in them:



This is where I'm basically stuck, the other afs packages are dead ends, and this one is the only one giving me what may look like the model files themselves, unless I'm supposed to open that DUMMY.DAT file, in which I have no clue how to. Does anybody have any clues about this? Help would be very appreciated. ;w; Thanks either way for taking the time to read this.

Gahh, that's all? Well it worked, thanks a lot, Youngmark!

Edit:

Here's the results ;o;! 

Had to add the outline effect manually here

Normal render


Thanks again and Mario too for the wonderful script
