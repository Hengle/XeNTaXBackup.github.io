- Post Title: Resident Evil: Mercenaries 3D LMT extract/convert to PC?

Hi guys!
I was wondering, is it possible to extract animation from LMT file or convert them for PC?

Maybe someone can take a look at RE5 LMT by wilsonso tool that supports this for PS3 lmt and add a feature from 3DS lmt to pc based on the same operating principle.

DL RE5 LMT Tool here - [http://www.mediafire.com/file/5n277fyfu ... l.rar/file](http://www.mediafire.com/file/5n277fyfucba9c6/Resident_Evil_5_LMT_Tool.rar/file)

Thx for any help and feedback!
