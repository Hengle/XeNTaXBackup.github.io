- Post Title: Danganronpa Another Episode Model Formats

I've been looking for a way to open Danganronpa AE model files

So far I've found 4 formats that might be related to models
.bnp - has PSCa in the header and what looks like bone names (for example: AC_FACE_NULL.HEAD.FACE_EYE_R.FACE_EYE_L.FACE_JAW.(No Group).pl00_ac_face)
.bnc - has PSCa in the first offset, where as with bnps, it's at the 0x20 offset. Seems to be an animation format, going by some of the filenames.
.bnb - has PSB7 in the header. All but one of the filenames of these kinds of files have "sky" in them, so it might be skybox related.
.bnm - has PSM9D in the header. Files of this type are all in the _map folder, so I'm guessing they're all level models.

I'd share some of the files, but last time I checked this wasn't allowed.

Any help would be appreciated

It's a matter of counts and size, imho. Should be ok if you uploaded a small sample of each filetype.

(But - as always in life - there's some guys who don't understand the rules and upload tons of copyrighted material.)

I see. Here are samples of each format: [https://mega.nz/#!gdkS3aRC!ryvTQlWNUwie ... WFMUZGrUjA](https://mega.nz/#!gdkS3aRC!ryvTQlWNUwiepVDyhBJ818Sh9ox6cYWzRWFMUZGrUjA)

I tried using your tool but I got kinda lost
As I suspected, this is the face of the game's protagonist

Have some of the textures too:
