So I tried using this Bad Company 2 import script:
[https://www.mediafire.com/folder/cy9wo46mzvm9h/BC2](https://www.mediafire.com/folder/cy9wo46mzvm9h/BC2)

But it does work on the BC1 models. Could someone help adapt it?

Here's a BC1 sample:

how did you run the script v0.3? Doesn't work for me nor in Blender 2.49 neither with newer versions.

I used the models on the BADCOMPANY2 MESHDATA.TAR download on this page:

this doesn't answer my question. Maybe you could read it again?

(You said that the  Bad Company 2 import script works for BC1 models so I'd assume you used that script, didn't you?)

My bad, I meant "does not", but typed does instead.

No, it does not work, that was a typo.

ok, then, did you try the Bad Company 2 import script with a BC2 sample successfully?
If so, then 1) how did you get it work?
and 2) could you provide a BC2 sample?

I got it working with the models in the link I sent to you.
When I tried extracting models from my copy of the game, the script did not work.
You want a sample of a model from my copy?
