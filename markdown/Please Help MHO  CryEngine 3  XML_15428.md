- Post Title: Please Help: MHO | CryEngine 3 | XML?

The file cutters on the wiki didn't work for me; one wouldn't run and the other link is dead. I'm uploading all the data files to [Mega](https://mega.nz/#fm/TxxXiZQB) and there's definitely a unique header starting with "nifs" and going for a few bytes after.

These are files from [Monster Hunter Online](http://mho.qq.com), a Chinese MMO. Inside are XML files with a bunch of game data. The idea is to get a script going to pack/unpack these things so an English patch can be made through unpack -> translate -> repack. Someone was doing this for the community before, but then refused to put patches out and demanded $500 for just the pack/unpack tools.

Here's a file I assume is inside one of these: [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Form1 ... lk.xml.dat](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Form1ca/Monster-Hunter-Online/master/Data/npctalk.xml.dat)
Here's a file I assume is a modified version: [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Form1 ... ta.dat.xml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Form1ca/Monster-Hunter-Online/master/Data/equipdata.dat.xml)

If there's anything else I can do to make this happen, let me know. I'm going to keep trying myself but I'm pretty new to this type of thing.

EDIT: Looks like some of the work has been done [here](http://aluigi.altervista.org/bms/monster_hunter_nifs.bms) and [here](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=12679)

..and [here](http://backup.zenhax.com/viewtopic.php?t=1976) where even aluigi came in and took a stab at it.

Thanks but this is completely unrelated to the question.
