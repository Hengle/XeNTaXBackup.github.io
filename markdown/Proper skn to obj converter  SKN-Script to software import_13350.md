- Post Title: Proper skn to obj converter / SKN-Script to software import

Hey there everyone. I wanted to ask you guys something...
I'm looking for some kind of way to extract the 3D meshes from LoL, but I'm specifically interested in the files that are after the Yasuo patch. For example, if I try to extract the .skn files with SIU, and then convert them to .obj with skntoobj OR Maya-script skn importer (import the skn and then convert to obj). For skntoobj I get a empty 3D model and for maya script sometimes their skeletons(if using the skl files). I get these issues for example: Braum, Tristana, Turrets, Yasuo, Ekko, Rek'Sai. Every release that was made after Yasuo.
Am I doing something wrong? What am I'm not considering?

Thanks in advance.

Well...I downloaded the FileTranslator for Maya 2015, but I'm currently having a annnoying issue. I've been trying to install Maya 2015 but for some reason, the installer says that it is already installed, refusing to continue the installation.
1- No, it's not installed. I've checked
2- Maya 2014's File Translator works, but as always, the newer .skn don't work.
3- Is it possible to convert the File translator from 2015 to 2014?
4- I'm looking for the .skn / physical location / .obj of the turrets from the new Summoner's Rift. Does anyone have it?

Thanks in advance.
