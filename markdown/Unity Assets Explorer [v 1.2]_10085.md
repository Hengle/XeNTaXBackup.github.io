How to work with the program:
1. Open Assets-file in program. To do this, click "Open assets-file" and select file.
2. Program will read the file and a list of files in the window.
3. To extract all the files you can use button "Extract All". Would extract the files in the program folder (the folder with the name of opened assets-file)
4. To extract a single file, select it in the list, click the right mouse button and choose "Extract This File".
5. To convert tex-files to DDS-files (when extracting), you must checked "convert TEX to DDS". (Works with extraction of all files, and extract a single file)
6. To import into the archive changed DDS-image:
    a) Extract image from the archive (with converting it into the DDS-format).
    b) Edit it in a photo editor. Make sure that saved it in the right format (the same as the original), and that the file size is the size of the original file.
    c) Put the modified image to the same location where the original image was extracted.
    d) Find in window of program tex-file, click the right mouse button and select "Import This File from DDS". Image imported into assets-file in place of the original picture.
    e) To save the new assets-file, click "Save as Assets-file"

Sorry for bad english =)

aaronindhouse, iOs?
Program was created to work with Assets-files Unity standalone PC version. (3.5, 4)
Most likely on iOS and other platforms Assets-files have other file-format.

It worked great, thanks.  
But when I open the .ttf, it said that it isn't a font file.
If it can import the en.xml and the other font files, that will be perfect.

Nice tool, unfortunately when .assets file is about 1,25gb it gives out of memory error, else works like charm.

Edit: Apparently .assets files of stellar impact game do not work at all (not find files) and resources.assets file freezes the tool in it.

Reason why u getting this error is that they are trying to load whole contents of the file in memory i guess  This is normal behavior. So more RAM can proccess bigger files

No, I have 6gb of RAM, the program itself can't handle than certain amount of memory handling more seemingly so afraid not more RAM is solution here.

Does this work for android games? (tekken-card-tournament.com)
When i tried existing extractors for android games they crashed.

In the web version the game only downloads 3 characters on your pc and the others seem to be saved somewhere hidden ( c:\user\NAME\AppData\LocalLow\Unity\WebPlayer\Cache\Shared)
Actually the game is kinda stupid and re-downloads the full game every time you play it.

> Reply from michalss

> I would more prefer to get unpacker for (*.unitypackage) files . But thx for this Is it possible to do it ?
I thought these could be renamed then un-rar'd?




Actually i think its an endian problem.  Some files were extractable but the images were mirrored and their colors seem a bit wrong. Even the files that extracted with unity names were unreadable by the engine.
Lastly a selfish request. Since I don't know what file the model's and animations are stored in i need to extract all 100+ files manually. This is pretty tedious and the 1kb files take long to extract. Any chance of a command line tool/ extract directory option.

I've extracted a file (from an Android game), edited it a bit and replaced that file (Import from original option), and now the game crashes. Also note that I changed the file, but in my .assets file it wasn't replaced, but it was put under the whole file.

So instead of replacing it (it was a text file btw), it added ANOTHER instance of it, and if I open the .assets file in Notepad++ I can see that the original text is in there, and what I modified is added to the bottom.

Is there a way to change the original and replace that? I want to translate an android game

Does anyone know how I can extract the attached maindata file? The unity asset explorer just crashes if I try to open it, however if I rename it to .asset and import it in to a unity project I can see all of the objects and resources but I can't extract them. 
I've also tried using unpackassets.cs script which works for the sharedassets but crashes on the maindata.

Hi Haoose 

You are doing a great job and i'm very grateful for this tool.
But my friend wants to make a full polish translation to a game on unity engine and i want to ask you about support ".xml" and ".ttf" files by your tool. It would be very helpful if importing these files would be possible. Can you do that? Please.

@Tabris: Which game's asset file is this? Far as I know, there are differences in file structures between older and newer Unity SDK versions. Maybe this file is made by an older or newer SDK than what the UAE can recognize.

Anyway, Haoose - I hope you're still working on this program  It'll be a real salvation for those who want to localize Unity games (like Anna EE and Kentucky RZ).

Hi,

The game is "Crasher" on PC. It was released in 2011.

Hope you guys we'll find a way to extract this file.

Thanks.

Which Unity engine version was this tool written for? I tried to load asset files for 2.0, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5 and 4.1, but none of them are read correctly.

I'm working on an Unity asset extractor by myself and I identified at least three completely different asset file formats. So far, it can read files for 3.5 and 4.1. I wonder if there has been any research on the older formats?

I don't mean to be rude, but an asset extractor is pretty much pointless.

First of all, depending on the version and game platform, you'll have different data structures for meshes, materials, textures or other assets.
Second, all assets are linked together via their indices from the preload table (which I assume you're using to get offsets and sizes for "files"). Furthermore, assets can be linked across multiple .asset files too.

By extracting assets as individual files, you lose all these pieces of information, making it hard to import 3D meshes and impossible to link them to materials, transformation matrices and scene hierarchy.
In order to import assets properly, you must keep them as they are in .asset files.

I have been working for some time on a maxscript for importing unity games, which you can download [here](http://kotschopshop.com/topic/5134976). For now it's fully compatible with Web and iOS games made with Unity 3.3 and 4.0.1 (possibly some older versions too).
I'm looking to test and add compatibility for other versions and platforms. Would you mind sending me some of those games you tested?

I'm aware of that. But while the surrounding asset file format is indeed pretty variable, the raw serialized object data seems to be very similar across versions. And asset files for Unity 3.5 even contain information about their own data structure, which makes it pretty simple to deserialize them.

My tool currently supports Texture2D, AudioClip, Font and Shader, which store their data in single unity objects with no dependencies. It also has a mode to export the raw serialized object data.

A SkinnedMeshRenderer, for example, is indeed much more complex. But I'm currently focused on the content that is relatively easy to extract or inaccessible from within the Unity editor.

On the few versions I've tested, I have seen differences in the raw data for the following asset types: Mesh, Texture2D, Renderer, SkinnedMeshRenderer. There are probably others too.
You may not have noticed it because from what I see you're only testing Web games. Try an iOS or PC game and you'll see what I mean.

Let me give you an example on how a 3D object would be properly loaded:

                    / Transform -> parent-Transform -> parent-GameObject
GameObject  - MeshFilter -> Mesh
                    \ Renderer -> Material -> Textures

If you're planning to extract only textures/sounds then it doesn't matter. But otherwise you'll be losing any means of linking assets together.

Well yes, I mostly tested some web games. But I also tested two PC standalone games without problems. Even if there are differences, it doesn't have to mean that they can't be figured out, right? 100% support for all Unity games that have ever been developed is a highly unrealistic target anyway. 

But I'd like to test a mobile Unity game... do you have an example? Preferably not from official app stores.

Ah, mine only supports 7 right now. These DDS color bitmasks for exotic RGB formats are a bit tricky. 
Do you maybe also know how to fix the vertical flip and convert AG to RGB normal maps?

That script could've saved me some time to figure out the archive format, but it somehow slipped through my Google research.

And the key to that are the file version and file "type", both of which would be discarded after extraction.
100% support for all Unity games is not unrealistic, it's my goal  Ok, maybe except xbox and PS3. Those use big endian data and would be better off with a separate script.

Yeah, I've been through hell figuring out which texture type is ARGB, which is RGBA or BGRA and so on. But in the end I didn't use custom bitmasks because for some reason the nvidia plugin for PS ignores them. So for the sake of compatibility I just switch image bytes instead 
There's nothing to fix, they are supposed to be flipped and they look as they should once applied to the models.

What do you mean by "AG normal maps", Alpha-Green? Maybe you just have the wrong channel order...

Well, I'll know when there are differences, because my program will start throwing exceptions.  And it's written in Java, so the endianness isn't a big issue in my case. It can easily switch between both during runtime without manual byte swapping.

Thanks! It mostly seems to work, just the PVR textures aren't supported yet. Hell, I don't even know how to read or convert these and the Wikipedia page about the format is a stub.

Oh, so I'm not the only one with that problem. 

The NVIDIA Texture Tools 2 can read the DDS files correctly, unlike the Photoshop plugin or ImageMagick. Really weird, since both the tools and the PS plugin are made by Nvidia...

Oh, ok then. I was a bit confused by the Unity editor, which flips the textures in the preview as well.

No, the color channels are fine. Unity 3 and higher encodes the normals into alpha and green for DXT compressed textures. Red and blue are simply low-quality copies of green for better compression, so the texture appears to be grayscale even though it's not a bump map. It's explained in detail [here](http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Cg_Programming/Unity/Lighting_of_Bumpy_Surfaces#Normal_Mapping_in_Unity).

Oh, and do you maybe have a mirror for your maxscript? I know, I could simply register on the forum, but I'm not a big fan of throwaway accounts...

It doesn't matter if your extractor knows about the differences, because whoever looks at the extracted data won't know. I'm talking about differences in the raw data structure (see below)

Hell, I don't even know how to read or convert these and the Wikipedia page about the format is a stub.Here's all you need to know about the PVR format.

I can see why it mostly works. The Web versions you've been working on are very similar to the iOS formats I linked. But have a look at these Web assets: [http://www.mediafire.com/download/a684a ... 378/tc.rar](http://www.mediafire.com/download/a684aruu36vu378/tc.rar)
The version is not listed, but I think it's 3.3.0. You're gonna notice some differences in the position of the preload table, and also the data structure of Textures, Renderers, SkinnedMeshRenderers and meshes.

Most games I've worked with have flipped texture coordinates and "regular" textures are flipped in the shaders. So I'm guessing unity takes it a step forward by flipping textures from the get go.

Red and blue are simply low-quality copies of green for better compression, so the texture appears to be grayscale even though it's not a bump map. It's explained in detail here..Ah, so it's the old trick used in Doom 3. If that's the case, then the solution is indeed moving AG image data in RG channels, and discarding the rest. However, you would have to know when the texture is a normal map and when it isn't. And the only way to do that is to go through material slots.

After inspecting some of the games you linked, I realize a universal and automatic script might be impossible. I'll have to do some more tests to see if I need to differentiate it by platform, and I';; post a link when I\m done.

Seems to be the [Scion car builder](http://www.scion.ca/scion/en/build-price/tc#build-your-scion). It uses version 2.6.1f3 according to the .unity3d file. And yes, my tool can't read these older 2.x and 3.3 formats yet.

Assets explorer works ok but errors out on some larger assets files.

Aluigi's BMS script apparently doesn't work on what it identifies as "Unity3d Raw" files, only works on "Unity3d Web" 

anyone know if the BMS script will be updated to open these "Raw" files?

UnityRaw is essentially the same as UnityWeb, just without the LZMA compression. Here's the fixed BMS script:

```
# script for QuickBMS http://quickbms.aluigi.org

endian big
idstring "UnityRaw"
get DUMMY long
get VER byte
get VER string
get VER string
get SIZE long
get DATAOFFSET long

goto DATAOFFSET

get NAME filename
string NAME += "_unpacked"
set PATH string NAME

get FILES long
for i = 0 < FILES
    get NAME string
    get OFFSET long
    get SIZE long
    set FNAME string PATH
    string FNAME += /
    string FNAME += NAME
    math OFFSET += DATAOFFSET
    log FNAME OFFSET SIZE
next i

```

hmmm, something wrong here. tried the new script on some of the Unity3d Raw files kicked out by the earlier script.  It kicked out a single file with a wacky name 
CAB-62d024b8560c18343a45fc4dff7f5562  and no file extension.

It's correct. The file is just a container for one .assets file (the extension is usually skipped in asset bundles for some reason).

Hello friends, I want to translate the game "Leisure Suit Larry Reloaded" to portuguese/br, and for that I'm using the "UnityAssetsExplorer-1.2" which did it's job well, it managed to extract all the files inside ".assets" with no problem.

However, now I need a tool to insert the modified files (.xml) back in.

Can anyone help me pointing me a tool that do it?

I take back what I said, it is possible 

The new script can be downloaded from the same place: [click](http://kotschopshop.com/topic/5134976)

It's compatible with PC/Web/iOS games made with Unity versions 2*, 3 and 4: 2.5.0f5, 2.5.1f5, 2.6.0f7, 2.6.1f3, 3.0.0f5, 3.1.0f4, 3.2.0f4, 3.3.0f4, 3.4.0f5, 3.4.1f5, 3.4.2f3, 3.5.0f5, 3.5.1f2, 3.5.2f2, 3.5.3f3, 3.5.4f1, 3.5.5f3, 3.5.6f4, 3.5.7f6, 4.0.0f7, 4.0.1f2, 4.1.0f4, 4.1.2f1, 4.1.3f3, 4.1.4f1, 4.1.5f1, 4.2.0f4

*2.5.0f5 is the oldest that I could find. If someone knows/has something older please let me know.

It works only with 3D models, however. Is there a working extraction / importing script for other filetypes within .assets files (eg. xml, ttf)?

*2.5.0f5 is the oldest that I could find. If someone knows/has something older please let me know.
The oldest one that I currently know is 2.0.2f2 from [here](http://www.idancerecords.com/games/MoonDragon.unity3d).

And would you mind to provide a mirror for your script that doesn't require an account to view the private thread?

@Rion Yes, because it's meant to be a 3D importer. I could research other asset types, but that would be pretty much pointless for a MAXScript. I suggest you wait for barracuda's extraction tool.

@barracuda Thanks, I'll look into it.
Here's a direct [link](http://www.mediafire.com/download/isrm248sbi7skay/Unity_AI_0.8.1.mzp)
For anyone interested, I strongly suggest downloading from the "official" [release page](http://kotschopshop.com/topic/5134976) to make sure you have the latest version.

Yes, it is possible to import the models with animation.
But it's something that I haven't done before with maxscript and I'll have to do some research first.

This program is very useful and I am glad it even works on Wine.

Could you make this program skip over 'bad files'? In one new game (Deemo) the resources.assets file has blank lines and it causes your program to have an error message "' ' is not a valid integer value" and then all extraction stops. So it basically is impossible to extract this file completely except by manually right-clicking to extract each one of after the blank lines (only if I sort by Type because then the blank ones appear after negative numbers).

Also, a command line interface to the program would be very useful.

I'm trying to import an image, but every time I save the file it still uses the old file. I followed the instructions and everything seems to work what am I doing wrong?

6. To import into the archive changed DDS-image:
 a) Extract image from the archive (with converting it into the DDS-format). DONE

 b) Edit it in a photo editor. Make sure that saved it in the right format (the same as the original), and that the file size is the size of the original file.
I open it in GIMP edit the part of the file I need to by copying another image onto it and anchoring it in the same layer. The filesize remains 1024x1024 although the mb drops from 5 to 4.

 c) Put the modified image to the same location where the original image was extracted.
overwritten the original file

 d) Find in window of program tex-file, click the right mouse button and select "Import This File from DDS". Image imported into assets-file in place of the original picture.
This works fine and I get the message "DONE" no visible changes though also not to the filesize.

 e) To save the new assets-file, click "Save as Assets-file" DONE

I start up the game and it still uses the old file. If I open up the edited file (it is edited because the save date has changed and it also works if I remove the file before I save) and exported the "edited" image I get to see the original image again.

Is there a way to convert the DDS to TEX maybe that would help?

Yeah I'm interested in writing a library for this myself, the source code / filetype spec for reference would be handy.

Just for information, a couple of weeks ago I released a quickbms script that should cover all or almost all the existent assets versions of Unity3d:

[http://aluigi.org/papers/bms/unity.bms](http://aluigi.org/papers/bms/unity.bms)

The format was easier than I thought, so the real task is being able to use/convert the extracted files.

Thanks for the extraction script!

Can we repack them at this point (suppose we manage to edit them somehow)?

The UI seems to be acting strange with non-standard desktop DPI settings.
Just set 125%, for example, then start the app and observe how it looks and behaves.
Should be an easy fix.

I think that there's a memory leak.
After opening the fourth/fifth asset file in a row, I got an error saying:

According to the task manager, UnityAssetsExplorer.exe uses ~952MBytes of memory.

Thank you for this tool.

I tried a lot of tools to export images from ios game (png crush, etc.) but no one works for me, except Unity Asset Explorer

But I have a problem. I would like to export images from an iOS game but the conversion Tex-> DDS doesn't work at 100%.
The game is 999: The novel [https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/999-the ... 73964?mt=8](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/999-the-novel/id741073964?mt=8)

So I launch Unity Asset Explorer 1.4 (I tried with 1.2 too) -> open Asset file -> and open "resources.assets" 
I export all (it stops beacause of a syntaxe error though) and I obtain a lot of file: .wav are well exported, but the images not.

I have all the character's portrait and some other images but the most of them are like that

or like this


here is a tex file i can not convert for exemple

I tried it out on some Android games, myself. One game (Nisekoi! Majikore - [http://apps.evozi.com/apk-downloader/?i ... oimajikore](http://apps.evozi.com/apk-downloader/?id=jp.konami.nisekoimajikore) ) has assets separated into .split# files, which it looks like should just be directly appended--no biggie there for me. However, there are various issues that clearly stem from minor errors, so I wonder if you could look into that. 

For example, this texture is juuust a little bit wrong when extracted. [http://i1097.photobucket.com/albums/g35 ... f2646b.png](http://i1097.photobucket.com/albums/g359/dpmm99/texture_zpsd0f2646b.png)

And maybe it's not true that the split files should simply be appended. This is what I got when I tried loading such a file after concatenating the contents: [http://i1097.photobucket.com/albums/g35 ... 3f13a4.png](http://i1097.photobucket.com/albums/g359/dpmm99/Appended_zps9b3f13a4.png)

Opening only the .split0 file: [http://i1097.photobucket.com/albums/g35 ... 61da85.png](http://i1097.photobucket.com/albums/g359/dpmm99/Split0_zps0b61da85.png)

I'm having the same problem as JohnHudeski, does it mean that the game is obfuscated or is there something else?

Nice work! it's just awesome...
But it seems i'm having a little problem.
I'm using this program for an android game and trying to export an tex to dds.
All other image that's in RGBA 8.8.8.8 works just fine but
whenever i export RGBA 4.4.4.4 format tex file (size512x512), there's only transparent areas in dds. 
is there a solution for this?

But when i tried to import the file using UAE 1.4, the dds file gets deformed... (colors and etc) any solution for this?

Standard DDS textures have channels in this order: A R G B.
Unity ARGB 4.4.4.4 textures from Android and iOS apps are R G B A.

My Unity Studio bit-shifts the data in order to get ARGB, which is why you get correct color information. But to add it back you would need to bit-shift it back to RGBA, otherwise the game will read the wrong channels.

I failed... it seems im doing something wrong in photoshop or somwhere else.
i changed channel, saved as with RGB 4444 (using nvidia plug-in) and tried to import with UAE 
and it says wrong size... i think the size got bigger when i mod the picture in photoshop.
But using Paint.net wont change it's size but i cannot change the channel with it.

anyway thanks for your great help.

You are probably saving that texture with mipmaps. Turn their generating off while saving DDS in Photoshop.

how about using Paint.NET for 'just' save to dds?
sometimes Photoshop doesn't work for dds.

You can work your texure on photoshop. just save it to .png
and than just load this .png file at Paint.NET AND save it to .dds

I was wondering if I could get some help extracting some textures from Transformers Universe
It's a Unity Webplayer game...

I've extracted some textures already but I am trying to find some maps, but am having trouble extracting the remaining files in the cache

How do I rip DLLs? UAE doesn´t extract them

EDIT: Ok, I think you mean the DLLs in GAME/GAME_data/Managed/ , but I have no idea how to find scripts in them. All I can read is this:

These DLLs include compiled code.
You don't get scripts.
You can try using Reflector (to decompile) a DLL, or, you can use Reflexil to modify a DLL "[inline](http://www.codeproject.com/KB/msil/reflexil.aspx)".

In Unity for developer we using use a NGUI font and choose the exact size where it will make it to atlas. 

There's are tutorial on youtube.

Save it in original format (DXT3, DXT5, uncompressed ARGB, etc., with mipmaps or without them).

Do you know how to tell what the original format is? I've tried every format and every compression rate and none of them end up with the correct file size. Haven't tried much with the mipmaps yet. I'll give that a shot.

Hey everyone. First I'd like to thank the OP for creating this program and everyone for helping test it.

I'm trying to replace a specific sound file (Impact_Club_01.ogg) from Shroud of the Avatar's resources.assets, with my own custom sound effect.

I successfully extracted it in both v1.2 and v1.4.

I can re-import the same file, and it's always successful.

However, when I try to import a custom file (which I converted from .wav to .ogg and named "Impact_Club_01.ogg") it doesn't work.

In 1.2, it gives me the result: a popup saying "ERROR"

In 1.4, it gives me the result: EStreamError ïîäíÿòà îøèáêà, ñ ñîîáùåíèåì : Out of memory while expanding memory stream


I have tried replacing SotA's sound .ogg file with my own custom one with the custom file size being:
A) Smaller file size
B) Larger file size

Always 10.0 to 10.8kb for both the original sound and custom replacement sound.
Very small file. However, resources.assets is VERY large: 671MB.



edit: SUCCESS! I used this program to do it.

Haoose,
I at least know that.
But it'd be great to see a note what's been updated.
Or, at least the fact that it has been updated.
Thanks for considering!

Где на скриншоте видно что они не отображаются? Все отображается у тебя.
А текста в этих файлах может и не быть. Если они переехали на новую версию движка текст могли переместить в какое-то другое место. Попробуй просто поиском по файлам поискать какую-то строку/слово текста. например "New Game" (или что там в игре есть). Так определишь assets-файл, а дальше уже в нем найдешь файл с текстом.
P.S. А вообще подобные вопросы надо задавать не тут, а на специализированном форуме (На [ZoG](http://www.zoneofgames.ru/forum/index.php?showforum=22)), т.к. это относится не к программе, а непосредственно к игре.

Спасибо нашел текстовый файл в resources.assets но есть одна проблема, один раз я его смог открыть, стало выдавать ошибку постоянно на нем ( resources.assets), пробовал переустанавливать игру, но безуспешно та же ошибка "out of memory while expanding memory stream", оперативки на компьютере 16 гигов
можно ли как нибудь избегать эту ошибку, и от чего она зависит.
и есть ли вариант перезаписи исходного файла больше размером чем он.
Заранее благодарен.

Hello, I'm having a problem when I try to replace a .tex.dds file. When I save it and import it into the resources.assets file, it tells me "ERROR" "DONE!". However, it doesn't update in the game? 

Does somebody know what I may be doing wrong?

Thanks in advance.

Hello there, just used the Assets Explorer and extracted a bunch of files. Long story short a lot of strange file formats came out and I'm mostly interested in script files and 3d objects. I've got *.43 | *.115 files. I guess *.43 files are the scripts and the *.115 the 3d files but how do I find the appropriate file extension or extract that content. Can somebody please help me with this?

I'm having a slight problem with extracting the sprites from an Android Unity game. It's not really a problem with this tool in particular, however, because DisUnity comes out with the same results.

Basically there's an Android game called "Godzilla Kaiju Collection" and extraction works fine, for the most part. However, I'm trying to extract the character sprites from the game which I believe are located in random files without extensions. However, extracting these files leave me with either a completely transparent image file (Unity Assets Explorer) or a Grey/White image (Disunity).

Any clue how I can extract these sprites?

From what I know the .43 are the 3d files. I found the program Noesis which can view the .43 files. [http://himeworks.com/noesis-plugins/](http://himeworks.com/noesis-plugins/)

Yep you were right. Also Noesis does work. Not all files work or open but that's okay hah, thank you for taking the time to inform me mate.

I really wanna check the code from the script files though, does anyone know of a program that can open 115 files? Really need this!

Excellent work, Haoose!
Please tell me whether your program from the command line just unpack all the contents *.unity3d file to disk? (as it does the disunity - but I do not like it because its requirements of Java)
If yes, please give the command to do it.
If not - specify a path where to dig, what to do such a task - from the specified file simply unpack everything on the HDD (and nothing else, no GUI, just unpacking).

(а теперь по понятному RU)
Отличная работа, Haoose!
Подскажи пожалуйста, может ли твоя программа из командной строки просто распаковать всё содержимое *.unity3d файла на диск? (как это делает disunity - но она мне не нравится в виду требования явы)
Если да, дай пожалуйста команду как это сделать.
Если нет - укажи путь, где рыть, что бы самому сделать такую задачу - из указанного файла просто выгрузить всё на диск (и больше ничего, без гуи, только распаковка на диск).

Заранее спасибо.

I'm actually not quite sure that this is right. The error is not because it's trying to load a legitimately large chunk in memory, it's because the format has changed, and it interprets it wrongly. What it considers to be a length is not, so it is trying to load too much. It's not just Assets Explorer problem, I'm getting the same error on disunity, with these newer assets. In particular, the section that is right before the externals section now seems to be different and require different parsing.

Has there been any progress on this issue? Trying to extract icons and such from Albion Online using version 1.5 but the bulk assets file can't be opened due to this error. 

Another issue is that it seems like of the files I can extract very few of them extract correctly. The colors all appear corrupted E.G. 


I appreciate all the work you've done for this program!

Hope it's okay to post here. Made an account specifically because I needed help. Whenever I export a texture file, it only seems to want to spit out colorful boxes like the ones bellow. In those pictures, I'm using Photoshop CS5.1 with DDS plugin but Gimp 2 as well as Microsoft Visual Studio all seem to yield similar results. Also, whenever I try to import from DDS, even if I haven't modified the file, I get "ERROR! Wrong size dds." I've tried opening .tex assets from a couple of different games and I get the same results. Any help is greatly appreciated!

[http://i.imgur.com/TU2FOFJ.png](http://i.imgur.com/TU2FOFJ.png)

The only exception is that some small icons seem to load up okay. So, I'm assuming it has something to do with the export shrinking my file?

I need some help. Or maybe an update.

I've been using this tool to extract the assets from the various Unity-based Angry Birds games (mainly Angry Bird Epic and Angry Birds 2), and it's been really great so far. However, the most recent update to AB2 uses a newer version of Unity, and it doesn't work properly with UAE.

For reference, the resources.assets file in the previous version of the game was 96.1 MB, and the program said it contained 152,788 files.
The resources.assets in the current version is 108 MB, but this time the program says it contains 244,477,845 files!

By the way, I use a Mac, and I run this program through Wine.

I seem to be getting a problem where the number of files in the .assets is -65536, which I can only assume is caused by the number being too big and wrapping around into the negatives.  Of course, no files are being displayed.

Привет! All the links are down, except the very old attached to the forum. Would you mind reuploading it to dropbox, yadisk or something like mega? Thanks.

PS. There is a copy at mega from [this post](https://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=10&p=109552#p109552), but its not current.

@justdownloading1, currently it's better to use UnityEx Ultimate. It has more features and it's more stable.
