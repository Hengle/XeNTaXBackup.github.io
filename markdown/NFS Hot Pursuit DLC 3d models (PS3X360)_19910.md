Hi! I extracted DLC files from NFS HP 2010 (PS3 and Xbox 360 version). But tools didn't work. One tool - Noesis with NFS HP plugins can extract only textures from PS3 version ([https://mega.nz/#!ylEwBKoL!NByp2XdBKoxm ... sWB2jFqSsY](https://mega.nz/#!ylEwBKoL!NByp2XdBKoxmfLBBTWhhfllA5GrICG0pwsWB2jFqSsY)) 
[http://www.mediafire.com/file/eqd4b6cnb ... ES+1.2.rar](http://www.mediafire.com/file/eqd4b6cnb223j3g/VEHICLES+1.2.rar) <- X360 files

I want extract models and I hope will transport DLC for PC version. Thanks for any help.

So what is that plugin you talk about, more info.
You need to learn to post more information all your posts are just for requests but no proper info, steps involved etc etc etc.

That's because he is working on something new, he ditched those scripts in favor to Blender tools for the Burnout Paradise Remastered, there is no confirmation that he will support NFSHP2010 or NFSMW2012 on the new tools for Blender: [https://youtu.be/IxGgD-cw7bs](https://youtu.be/IxGgD-cw7bs)
Its one of those waiting games to see what he will do/release.

btw, you should have posted whole link so others know where its from and by whom: [https://zenhax.com/viewtopic.php?p=41035#p41035](https://zenhax.com/viewtopic.php?p=41035#p41035)

That is old and outdated, you ONLY need one library for the game you want to work on, then simply download the updated scripts from the python folders, and use them in latest Noesis version, that 1.7GB is just all stuff included in one pack, I do not recommend it.

(fmt_HotPursuit_PC_Models.py is the .dat importer, isn't it? You might upload a working .dat sample to see how it works.)
Those which can be loaded (from NFSHP_Library_PC\51_00_00_00) are only 1k of size. So what?

It doesn't work that way.
You need to place all scripts accordingly, I do not recommend scripts for all games to be placed in Noesis due to some weird conflicts, lets say in this case scripts for NFSHP2010.
You first unpack any desired BIN/BNDL archive via Noesis, BIN=vehicle, BNDL=map/shaders/fonts etc. they are all same BND2 format just different extension.
Then you get file/folder structure of extracted model, similar to those in Library archives, the small file along side texture or model is the header information, while the larger one in size is the body chunk data.

Those Library files are NOT to be loaded, they are required by the scripts and nothing else. You need actual game files to extract and import inside Noesis, then export to what ever other format you need.

The script Packers are also usable to Pack what ever you modified be it texture or mesh data, unfortunately there are no proper tools to do that.

The scripts for NFSHP2010 and NFSMW2012 only support PC not the consoles, while BP/BPR does.

I hope it clears up a bit how they work.

I've started working on a Blender Importer addon for HP2010 (PS3 version), I might finish it soon. I would be grateful if someone could send me the SHADERS and VEHICLETEX files from PS3 version, right now I'm using the PC ones, but using the ps3 version would be better.

> Any news?I made a quick 'n dirty quickhack for XBOX _model.dat files, so don't expect too much:


 Make_obj-NFS_HP-XBOX.zip
(250.61 KiB) Downloaded 42 times



```

### Not to be used with PC _model.dat files! ###

You'll need Make_obj-NFS_HP-XBOX.exe and dlls from Make_obj-NFS_HP-XBOX.zip
 (and Hex2obj_0.24x.exe)
AND the files in hex2obj_0.24c.zip:
https://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=29&t=10894&p=142434&hilit=+actual#p142434

There's some superfluous vertices in some submeshes and I don't have the time to 
solve this properly because I'm too busy with RL concerns atm so fix it for yourself,
please - you may hate it. (If so then don't use this solution, please.)

(Three models tested only; for FF_CE_20_9D_model.dat some SMs seem to be missing.)

Here we go
-----------

- start Make_obj-NFS_HP-XBOX.exe and load a *_model.dat file
- H2O files 0 to x are being created (not obj as told in first line)
- close the app

------------------------------
- start Hex2obj_0.24x.exe and load the same *_model.dat as before
- File SaveAs Mmesh
  (it reads "Mmesh", not "mesh", well)

- read the pop window's text and do as you're told

- for each H2O file an obj file should be created

HTH
shak-otay


"importing to blender"
----------------------
import single obj with wavefront importer
or use .py script

When executing load_multi_obj_blender2.69.py in a blender Text Editor window 
make sure to have set "path_to_obj_dir" to YOUR NFS (with obj) directory.

(obj files in a maybe contained subdirectory are being loaded, too)
------------------------------------

btw:
- first ASCII line in 43_95_C3_AE_model_8.obj for example contains: 
  43_95_C3_AE_model.dat_16.h2o
(keep in mind that the numbers (8 and 16 here) are different, sorry for that)

Blender Import Addons
Importer addons for viewing models and collisions from Burnout Paradise (PC and PS4), Burnout 5 (X360), Need for Speed Hot Pursuit 2010 (PC and PS3) and Need for Speed Most Wanted 2012 (PC and PS3). It's an improved version of Noesis model viewer plugins with support for multimaterial meshes, multiple UVs and texture types.

Download
[DGI_BlenderAddons](https://drive.google.com/open?id=10DGQFPF6aeco2tUxp6MBfSidR-8lhNxe)
Download the following files "..._BlenderAddons", "..._Library" of the game you want to visualize the models and "nvidia-texture-tools".

Install
For installing it on Blender, use the option "Install from File" on the Add-ons tab and choose each .zip files (it's not necessary to extract the files). Then, active the addons on "User Preferences" at Add-ons tab. There are tutorials about it on Youtube and Blender wiki.

Usage
Firstly, unpack/extract the file (BIN./.BNDL) using the unpacker I made for Noesis ([DGI_NoesisPlugins](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B1NgOi5F1w1-UGpYMVgyVmFUdEk?resourcekey=0-WWEKhToSmDDEYO-fxzptVA&usp=sharing)).
After that, you go on blender -> File -> Import -> NFSHP/MW/BP. In the import screen, you can import the model by many ways, however the best way is importing the file that is inside the folder 06_01_00_00 (00_00_01_06 for PS3, aka GraphicsSpec), it will load the whole vehicle model. For map files (TRK) the equivalent file is in the folder 50_00_00_00 (00_00_00_50 for PS3, aka InstanceList).
So, in the import screen select the file inside the folder 06_01_00_00 and press enter.

For those that wonder, regarding post above, you still need Noesis and its required Unpacker of the game to extract assets first in order to use Blender add-on for importing .dat files for both VEH/TRK.

Hmm, I tested the addons on 2.79. I think the issue is an external python library LXML that the script uses. I'm working on a verification that will probably fix it.

Hi! I extracted DLC files from NFS HP 2010 (PS3 and Xbox 360 version). But tools didn't work. One tool - Noesis with NFS HP plugins can extract only textures from PS3 version (https://mega.nz/#!ylEwBKoL!NByp2XdBKoxm ... sWB2jFqSsY) 
http://www.mediafire.com/file/eqd4b6cnb ... ES+1.2.rar <- X360 files
https://mega.nz/#!3tVnACBS!YrOYJSLnXb-l ... 2PTwH52EA4 <- PS3 files
I want extract models and I hope will transport DLC for PC version. Thanks for any help.

Yes. I also want to help.

Anyways, it doesn't make sense for me to waste time with XBOX Need for Speed Hot Pursuit 2010 Models format (.dat)
while an 84k blender python script exists.

So interesing, when I had Win 7 and 3ds Max 2019, UV mapper was destroied but when I have Win 10 and 3ds Max 2020 everything is good. But some bugs is still avaible.. Smooth and glitch. Okay I can delete single poly but with smooth is too hard.

I updated the Blender addons some time ago, it should fix the issue with LXML library. Maybe there are other fixes, but I didn't remember right now. It probably fix most of the reported issues. Remembering that the addons is for the PS3 and PC versions, not X360.

Check if you installed the NFSHP Library available in the drive link, because I reproduced this error by deleting my library folder.
It should be in: C:\Users\username\AppData\Roaming\Blender Foundation\Blender\2.79\scripts\addons
or in Blender install dir.

Hey DGIorio

Was wondering if for the script that unpacks, can something be done for the audio to play as should with proper extension, for example.
For audio/soundFX:

```
	SPS EA standard Format: PC\81_00_00_00, Console\00_00_00_81 remove first 128bytes in order to play the sound
```

and once you give them correct extension, GIN for those with the 476E7375 after 4bytes, and SPS extension for those that have the following header 4800000C after the 128bytes.

And then everything can be played nicely in foobar2000/vgmstream combo, unfortunately no encoders out there to convert back to same format to mod sounds.

I guess maybe the bytes before the header can be saved same way it is for textures/meshes in a separate dat file and the actual audio file in a separate file with correct extension GIN/SPS, I wonder what those bytes before header really represent, maybe you know?

FrostyEditor can handle NFS Hot Pursuit (PC).
Frosty Tool Suite can ONLY handle the following Frostbite 3 engine based games, such as:
Need for Speed Rivals
Need for Speed 2016
Need for Speed Payback
Need for Speed Edge Online
Need for Speed Heat (currently in development)
Need for Speed Hot Pursuit (assuming is 2010 version based on Chameleon engine variation) that you mention has nothing to do with The Frosty Tool Suite, maybe it will be supported by someone else one day once the Frosty Unified Framework will be released, but that's still private for the time being, under development.

So... what are you talking about?

Oh that's my bad, i confused Rivals with Hot Pursuit. 
Btw GalaxyMan who make the FrostyEditor and the current Unified Framework now work at EA/Dice, so their developments have been cancelled.

You really need to gain some knowledge about what is going on, before spreading rumors as such, yes indeed GMan applied for a job at EA/DICE, and got approved, BUT he will not cancel the project, it will simply be handed over to derwangler and Cade will continue to support it starting Feb 1st, as he has done so far alongside GMan.

Thanks. Can you explain more clearly how exactly this entire process is supposed to work then? I'm a little new to this particular guide and your tutorial on page 2 isn't written very clearly. So do I have to extract the .bin files inside the VEHICLES folder in Hot Pursuit's directory using Noesis first? It's not letting me do that even with your noesis plugins you provided as it keeps saying "File type is unrecognized' or something.

Hey everyone! I am new here to the scene. So I was wondering, can anyone know how to do a simple swap in-game? Just a already existing car and change that for the hot pursuit game mode.

If anyone has trouble with the tutorial or still doesn't know how to rip cars from HP despite this topic I've made a video tutorial on it, hopefully it helps someone.

Hi! I’ve tried this tutorial but for some odd reason Blender does not want to import the model, I get an error message   
I don’t understand why, I’ve done everything exactly like in your video...

Everything goes well until blender gives me that error message.

Well I'm no expert on Blender and its issues, maybe you're using an incompatible version of Blender? Or the scripts weren't imported properly. Perhaps someone with better knowledge here might have a better idea.

Ok, thank you for your quick answer.
It is not the version of blender, I tried older versions and they don’t work either.
 I will keep trying to find a solution on my own then

Hey everyone! 

I succeeded to extract the models from nfs hpr and imported them into blender, now does anyone know how to import them back into the game? Didn’t see any information about this anywhere on the internet   

My aim is to modify or even replace the models, so I just miss that last (huge) step, to bring them back in !

The author of the scripts knows how to, i doubt he will ever share that information/tools/scripts, but if you look under his signature, he has a youtube channel where there's a tutorial about how he does it for Burnout, maybe its same procedure, very complicated though.

I've started working on a Blender Importer addon for HP2010 (PS3 version), I might finish it soon. I would be grateful if someone could send me the SHADERS and VEHICLETEX files from PS3 version, right now I'm using the PC ones, but using the ps3 version would be better.

.

Thank you! I have successfully decrypted with ikskoks's tool and Skyth's key.

Scripts doesn't work in 2.79, 2.82, 2.92. 2.77 up. for me. (Windows 10, x64).  I tried different versions x32 x64.
I install archive, but in menu import Blender only "Batch converter" and it not work. Then I tried to remove the batch converter from the archive, but menu has a tab "Need for speed HP 2010 Models (dat)" But when I select a model to import nothing happens at all...
