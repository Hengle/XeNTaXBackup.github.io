- Post Title: 3d files-noob help

Hello.Im new to all this hexing stuff.I found a tut from MultiEx page about unknown archives.However im more interesting in getting 3d models out of games.Im using Blender.but i never knew how 3d files keep information inside.I know they need to keep(probably) vertex coordinates,uv data,body weight,skeleton(armature),maybe animation data.But i dont know how they are stored in binary files.Thats why im writing this.Is there any tutorial or link that will help me in this?
Are most of them storing data like 3ds or x?Please help the ultra noob.Any information will be highly appriciated  .And even telling me how general files like .x or other binarys work will really help,too!
