- Post Title: [Tales of Graces f] Convert .tex to .dds problems.. (edit)

I tried to apply chrrox's toDDS.bms script [viewtopic.php?f=10&t=7330](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=7330) but the result was weird.
What's wrong..? Can some one edit the bms script to apply this case?
Here is sample file. [http://www.sendspace.com/file/b0srfc](http://www.sendspace.com/file/b0srfc)

 Information.


Weird result.

It looks like the start offset used is wrong that is why the image is skewed.
