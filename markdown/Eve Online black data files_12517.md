- Post Title: Eve Online black data files

Eve Online uses encrypted text files to determine a lot of the visual data on their models. Their old system was that each ship had its own black file and they could be decrypted into json files using this open-source utility.

Now the new data structure is that there is one big black file for every model in the game and black2json doesn't work on it and the creators have departed the scene. Could anyone else get this file decrypted? Thanks.
