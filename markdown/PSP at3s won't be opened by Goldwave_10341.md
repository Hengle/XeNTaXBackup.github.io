- Post Title: PSP at3s won't be opened by Goldwave

the at3 from the following games

Birth By Sleep Final Mix
Dissidia 012
Peace Walker 
Crisis Core

refuse to open in goldwave. I'd blame the extraction method but I have no idea how to get them otherwise (BBS modding suite and UMDGen for 012).
Any ideas?

I converted them to .aa3 with an utility that found somewhere in this forum and used Sony's Media Go to play/convert them to mp3s.

I tried that. but for some unknown reason the ATrac3plus tool does work only for some AT3s.
