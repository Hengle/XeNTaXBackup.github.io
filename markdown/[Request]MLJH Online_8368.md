Hello, ok a interesting game based in Unreal Engine 2, the format of files is .PAK, using a bms script of Xin Jian 3 Online I can unpack it but all files with numbers, no names, nothing, maybe somebody can take a look into files, ok thanks a lot for support I hope somebody can give me a hand.

PD: ok this file MLJH Online Archive Research (filecutter) is cutted first bytes and last bytes, because the size of file have 1GB.
      and this one MLJH Online 2D-3D Samples is what extracted with bms scripts.
