- Post Title: X360 pak extract aid :D

Hello all, I couldn't find an introduction section as to have as my first post, but here goes. ^^
I hope to not disturb you, but i'm trying to view models/animations in DBZ:UT in noesis, but i'm stuck and i've been trying to do this on my own for a week. 
I'm not a coder and i'm new at this, please excuse my slowness. I've gotten this far from google searches and YT... 
Here's what i've done that lead to me being stuck. 

1.) I successfully extracted the game (mounting the image)
2.) I used Game extractor to extract the .AFS file that contained the characters.
3.) It extracted battl files with no file extension, so i used a hex editor to see what the file types were.
4.) After looking at a few of the battl files I figured they were .pak files maybe? (looking at the Ascii)
5.) I changed the battl files extensions to .pak. 
I can't figure out how to extract them. I'm not sure if maybe i should redo all my steps, change programs, or maybe its my noobness, lol.

Any help will be greatly appreciated.

U can try revelation's dbrb plugin for noesis.  Not sure if it uses the same format though.
