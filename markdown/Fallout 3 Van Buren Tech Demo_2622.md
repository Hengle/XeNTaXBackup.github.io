[Leaked Tech Demo](http://www.nma-fallout.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=35970)

Model Format .G3D/B3D, .SKEL, and .ANIM

I've attached Hex Workshop structures for these formats. The G3D/B3D format is mostly done. The Skeleton and Animation looks to be compressed. I suck at compression stuff. Could use some help.
