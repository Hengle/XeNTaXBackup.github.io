- Post Title: bcstm plugin for vgmstream needed!

Hi coders!

The new Transformers: Prime - The Game for Wii has a little endian brstm variant. Almost the same as the old format, only minor changes plus the reverse.
Here are two samples: [http://www.gamefront.com/files/22623281/bcstm.7z](http://www.gamefront.com/files/22623281/bcstm.7z)
Can anone enhance vgmstream once more? This would be fantastic! 
Thanks in advance. 

Regards, Timo

Funky, I wonder if these are 3DS files; there's a CWAV that's quite similar to RWAV that I've already added support for.  Link seems to not work just now, I'll try again later.
