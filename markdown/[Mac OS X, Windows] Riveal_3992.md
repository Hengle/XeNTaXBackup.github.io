Riveal didn't extract anything from my Spelunx img.sit file. Do I need a MAC to extract from MAC files?

That is probably a StuffIt-compressed disk image, and Riveal understands neither StuffIt compression nor disk images. 

Generally, Riveal should be used on games that have been installed onto a hard drive. There are a few cases where it understands a game's installer files but Spelunx isn't one of them.

Unfortunately, that is true of many of the older (pre-OS X) Mac games, like Spelunx.

Is there a StuffIt extractor that will work on it?

Try [StuffIt Expander 2011 for Windows](http://www.stuffit.com/win-expander.html).

It always says it's been interrupted even when I have no other programs up and tells me to quit it. I installed StuffIt standard 9, but the files it extracts are a lot smaller than it says they will be, for example, all the SFX files that it says are 6-10 KB large are all 0 KB after extraction.

Here are the Spelunx files unstuffed: [http://homepage.mac.com/rshayter/SpelunxColor.zip](http://homepage.mac.com/rshayter/SpelunxColor.zip)

These are (of course) [old-fashioned multi-fork Mac files](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fork_%28file_system%29), so they look odd on a Windows system. Many of the files appear to be 0 KB, but that's just the data fork. Most of the content is actually in the resource fork. In a ZIP file, the resource fork is stored in a parallel set of files in the "__MACOSX" directory. The resource fork files all start with "._".

To save you some time, here is what Riveal (running on a Mac) extracted from Spelunx: [http://homepage.mac.com/rshayter/SpelunxColorRiveal.zip](http://homepage.mac.com/rshayter/SpelunxColorRiveal.zip)

I hope this helps.

Thank you! Is there any program that can open those kinds of PICT files? I've tried Quicktime, Irfanview, Xnview, and none of them can open them, so can any program view them?

Interesting. QuickTime could open PICT files a few years ago. I don't when or why they removed that feature.

Sorry, but I don't know of any other Windows application that can view PICTs.

Is there a converter? If not, can a modern Mac actually view them, or are they broken?

On Windows? Not that I know of.

QuickLook in the current Mac OS X Finder works fine. (Select a file and press the spacebar.)

The only app I have that can view and convert PICTs is [GraphicConverter](http://www.lemkesoft.com/content/188/graphicconverter.html).

I recently used Riveal to extract the sounds and textures from realMyst iPad, which worked so well I tried it with another iPad app made with Unity, The World Ends With You -Solo Remix-. This too was a success, except that for many of the resource-assets images, they were purple with a yellow background, perhaps because the program interpreted them as three-color images, rather than four-color images. It did not understand that the fourth color was transparency, so it shifted the pallet in an erroneous way such that it showed yellow in the areas in which the images were supposed to be transparent, or at least that's my theory. Is there any way to amend this error, or is it of no consequence because it is not a Cyan game? I only ask because Riveal 10.5.1 is the only program I know that can extract resources from Unity iOS apps.

Here are example images:
[http://www.brickshelf.com/gallery/mirro ... _rdm_f.png](http://www.brickshelf.com/gallery/mirrorman95/TWEWY/npcza_rdm_f.png)
[http://www.brickshelf.com/gallery/mirro ... splash.png](http://www.brickshelf.com/gallery/mirrorman95/TWEWY/unitysplash.png)
[http://www.brickshelf.com/gallery/mirro ... t_text.png](http://www.brickshelf.com/gallery/mirrorman95/TWEWY/esctoexit_text.png)

The last two images are from Unity's default resources, which were also in realMyst.

You have discovered an unannounced feature.   

I haven't tested Riveal much with apps other than Cyan's, so I'm not surprised that there is a problem with one of the 10 or so texture formats Unity iOS apps use. It also looks like different apps have different versions of Unity's default resources.

We should take this tech support incident to e-mail. I'm a guest here on XeNTaX and I think this forum is meant for announcements. Please [contact me](http://http//rshayter.net/contact). I will post an update here when I've fixed the problem.

I have sent you a message at that contact link, and hope you can respond soon. I didn't know this feature was unannounced, but I'm glad you're taking the time to look at the problem I am describing.

Sadly, it appears that Ron Hayter passed away earlier this year.

I'm reaching out to see if anyone possibly still has access to the PC version of Riveal. The Mac version appears to live on in several iterations, but all links that I have been able to find to the PC version go to the creator's page, which is now lost. Any help to those looking now or in the future would be greatly appreciated.

I used  to have the windows version but unfortunately I deleted it after some clean up of the older game version.
Now I'm forced to work in Mac which causes me some trouble...

I just so happen to have a copy of Riveal 10.5.2 for PC sitting on my machine that I downloaded back in March 2013. (Hurrah! My hoarding ways are useful!)

The dates on the program itself appears to be September 2012. 

I suspect this isn't the latest version released, but it might help?

I just need a place to put the file. I don't have a file host.

Hey Moleculor, I just signed up now to try and encourage you to upload your version if you still can. It would really help me out with inspecting the sound effects in Dishonoured and other Unreal games. I'm an avid sound designer and even do foley work for animation series, but I just love unique sci-fi noises in games generally, so I'd definitely appreciate it. I know that 4shared, MediaFire, Mega and Dropbox all allow free file hosting, though I think they all require a registration. Let me know if you ever get a chance anyway, I cannot find a working link to this application either.

Oh man, really? How did you find out? That sucks a lot, he was such a cool guy to create the program and even visit here for so many years updating us on the post. It's a bugger that I only just discovered his work as well, wish I'd known about it in 2009. And I agree, I'd be grateful to anybody who may still have a copy of Riveal available, it's just too useful to be left isolated.

I wanted to let everyone know that Ron's website for Riveal has been restored at a new domain name - the old domain name was .net, the new domain is .com. Please update your links:

[http://www.rshayter.com](http://www.rshayter.com)

The final version of Riveal, 11.1, is available on the site.

If a moderator can update the first post in this thread with the new domain name, it would be appreciated.
