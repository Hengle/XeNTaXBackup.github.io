- Post Title: The extensive audio header collection thread

Hello all!

I've worked with extracting audio formats and header manipulation for so long now that there's time to open a thread about this. Here I want to collect all the headers I know so far and that I know how to apply. 
The information I want to give here is not only the header and audio format but also upload samples to each one of them with tool suggestions how to decode them or manipulate the header in order to play/convert them!
Any contribution is highly welcome!
Next post will be the - hopefully growing list of different formats and headers.

Have fun!
