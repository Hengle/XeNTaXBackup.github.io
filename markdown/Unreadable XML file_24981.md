- Post Title: Unreadable XML file

I found some files in .DDF format, which when opened in my notepad look a lot like XML. Some things I can understand, but others seem to be in another language and others are completely unreadable

It's not an XML file, but a binary one. You'd have to open it in a hex editor to see the data properly. That being said, if this is a [standard DDS file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DirectDraw_Surface), there are plenty of viewers that can open it and display the contents as an image.

Aah, my bad. Apparently my brain stopped reading after ".DD" and autocompleted the "S".
