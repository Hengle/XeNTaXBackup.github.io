- Post Title: Looks like a MDX File. Need a little help

I was curios if anyone can help, I have this 3D Game file that appears to have a *.MDX extension. When I look at it though it appears to be different. I was wondering if anyone has any ideas? Thanks

Appears to be different? From what?

Looks like a simple model file. A bunch of frames (maybe) followed by vertex buffer and then index buffer.
Textures referenced are tga's.
