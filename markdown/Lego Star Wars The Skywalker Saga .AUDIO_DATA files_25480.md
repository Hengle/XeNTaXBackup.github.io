- Post Title: Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga .AUDIO_DATA files

I've been trying to convert the .AUDIO_DATA files from the new Lego Star Wars to no success, but a friend of mine on my Discord server managed to convert one using a Mac-only audio editor called Cog. I'm on Windows, so I can't tinker with the program myself. Apparently, Cog lists the file as being a Microsoft 4-bit ADPCM (mono/interleave) at a sample rate of 44,100, bitrate 178. I've tried using programs that supposedly convert this format to PCM, but nothing has worked.

Can someone help me out with this? Here's a link to one of the .AUDIO_DATA files.

Can you upload more samples? Engine sound is not a good sample for finding audio format.

Best samples would be:
- some character dialogues/voices,
- music
etc.

That file is the only one that doesn't work using the Cog program, I was hoping someone could figure out how to convert it if possible.
Try this file instead, the X-wing blaster cannon sound.

Not the best samples in the world, but I'll just post what I came up with and you can test it yourself on other samples.


So this is my script:

```
start_offset = 0x5B
channels = 2
interleave = 0x100
sample_rate = @0x0C
num_samples = data_size
```


You can save it with name ".audio_data.txth" and put it with other files.
Final effect should look like this [https://imgur.com/a/77dSsAV](https://imgur.com/a/77dSsAV)

Now you can install foobar2000 with vgmstream plugin
and you should be able to play your audio - just drag and drop your file to foobar's window.

This almost works. It starts off fine for a moment, but then after a few samples it just goes crazy. I changed the channels from 2 to 1 which works better. Other samples just play poorly all throughout. Here's an example conversion:

Actually I tried it again just using VGMStream by itself without Foobar as a frontend, and it works flawlessly... except on one or two files. I'll compare the data in their headers with ones that work and see if I can tweak the script to fix the broken ones.

EDIT: Update! My friend cu2 on Discord suggested a fix for the looping sounds! On one file, I used a hex editor to remove the 44-byte loop portion of the header, and now it plays perfectly. I think that solves it!
