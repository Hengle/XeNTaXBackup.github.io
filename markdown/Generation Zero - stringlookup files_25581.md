- Post Title: Generation Zero - stringlookup files

Hello, I have a problem with editing file with texts for game Generation Zero. The file with texts is probably "master_eng.stringlookup" (localized in "game11.arc" under "0000003c.dat"). 
How I edit this file? 
How I import it back into the game?
Thanks

--> The tools (that worked for MAD MAX or Rage 2) not working for the Generation Zero.
