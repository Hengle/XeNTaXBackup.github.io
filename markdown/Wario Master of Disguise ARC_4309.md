- Post Title: Wario: Master of Disguise ARC

Hello people of Xentax! I was hoping someone here could help me open this archive, as the typical ARC extractors don't do the job. ARC is a typical DS format, but something about this one seems to foul up the works upon an extraction attempt, usually resulting in a line of meaningless gibberish. Please take a look and let me know if you find anything!

Being a big Wario fan, I can really get behind this. If I had any programming knowledge I'd definitely try this one. Unfortunately I'm dumb as a plank when it comes to programming.

Anyone help us out?
