- Post Title: Granny models obfuscation

Hi, I wonder if someone knows how to obfuscate a granny model.
My game is metin2 and I want to complete obfuscate models.
I provided an example gr2 from another server which did obfuscate their model.

I'd be surprised if jayn23 told you anything.
The person that runs that Server asked him not to release a way to decrypt the files.
He honored that request and I respect him for doing so.

It's not that hard to break them. I did in less then 5 minutes. But I'll not tell you how.
