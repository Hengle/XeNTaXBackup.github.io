I was wondering if there is any way to open or convert this video file.

[VGMToolbox r870](http://sourceforge.net/projects/vgmtoolbox/), or greater, can handle split this file into .m2v and Sony ADPCM.  

You can then use vgmstream to convert the music to WAV and mkvmerge to combine the audio and video into a single stream.

Thank you so much for your help.
