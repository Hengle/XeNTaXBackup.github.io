Hey guys, I was able to extract the .aax sound files from my Bayonetta PS3 disc, however I'm not sure how to convert them to a playable file format. I've read snippets on this forum and various places on the internet about people successfully converting them into .wav files, but I can't seem to figure out how to do so. Can anyone help me out with this?

You need a Winamp plugin called [vgmstream](http://hcs64.com/files/vgmstream/vgmstream-r1019-test.zip)

This will allow you to listen to the .AAX files in Winamp

If you wish to convert the .aax files using vgmstream, just select the .aax files and drag them onto the test.exe to convert them into .WAV files

Thanks brendan19, you pointed me in the right direction. I also needed to download vgmstream External DLLs in order to convert them into .wav format. Found here:

I however couldn't get the .aax files to work with Winamp after having put the plugin that you provided into the Plugins directory of my Winamp folder. Do you know why that is?

The vgmstream.dll goes into the Plugins folder. All the other files go inside the Winamp folder as well as the external DLLs too.
