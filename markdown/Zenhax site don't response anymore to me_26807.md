This is my own problem or the site zenhax needs maintenance?

There are chances it will not be fully restored (maybe archived at best): [https://twitter.com/luigi_auriemma/stat ... 0640954369](https://twitter.com/luigi_auriemma/status/1664420720640954369)

Well, if ZenHAX dies, doesn't QuickBMS die too?

    "ZenHAX forum"
    "the official support forum for QuickBMS"

I think he created his forum to be a discussion place for his QuickBMS tool, and not necessarily a clone of Xentax. They just happen to have similar interests.

Why not just invite him here as a supermod and create a section specifically for QuickBMS? Pool expenses?

I notice this too. What about ongoing market jobs? Is that gone forever? Zenhax is the only place that had an active market section. Xentax doesn't.

I think we were born in the wrong generation.  Soon ChatGPT will be taking over as forum moderator for all forums (joke).
