I wrote this program a while ago to extract the files.  Hopefully it will work for you too!

Just put the .exe file in the same folder as GODOFWAR.TOC, PART1.PAK and PART2.PAK, and then run the .exe file.  It should create a folder with all of the extracted files.

thank you friend! Do you have a tool to compress the PAK file? I want to edit the game videos and then put them back in ISO

I tested it on the e3 demo version, started to extract it, but after a while, it kept loading numbers infinitely. The GODOFWAR.TOC file has a different structure from the finial version

I don't think this program is working, no folder where created after running it.
