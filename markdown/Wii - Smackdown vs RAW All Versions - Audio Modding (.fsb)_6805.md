- Post Title: Wii - Smackdown vs RAW All Versions - Audio Modding (*.fsb)

Hi, I'm an up and coming modder working on a modding the SvR series on the Wii. My problem is, I can't seem to figure out how to mod fsb files. I tried using aluigi's FSBEXT and the extracted files are in genh format. due to this, said program cannot reinject the files, be they original or modified. I also must compress the audio so that it does not make the game data overall go over 4.37 GB.

If anyone can help me out, I would really appreciate it.
