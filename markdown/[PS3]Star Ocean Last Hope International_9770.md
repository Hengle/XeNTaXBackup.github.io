Hello.

Is there any script of way to either browse or extract the huge aska0000.bin file? Its about 22gb.

I saw another thread for X360 but wasnt the same type of files.

the filecutter only gave me 2 blank error messages when trying to cut it. So i used winrar for with old volumenames and renamed one to .bin (works for videofiles/making samples).

Sorry to resurrect such an old thread but how did you manage to "decrypt" (?) the header of that file? The first few kb look like random junk and there's no file table/directory that I could find...
