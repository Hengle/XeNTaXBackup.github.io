I've never encountered this type of .vaff format before with regards to audio, if anyone has any idea how to go about decrypting/converting I would gladly appreciate your input!

It's just a container for a normal RIFF/WAVE file - you can either delete everything up to offset 0x68 or use any wave ripper.
