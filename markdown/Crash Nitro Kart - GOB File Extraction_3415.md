- Post Title: Crash Nitro Kart - GOB File Extraction

Hello. I tried using MultiEx commander to extract the contents of a GOB file from the game "Crash Nitro Kart" for the XBOX. 
I did not work.
Would it be possible to get support for this type of file?

There are 2 files, which i believe tie together.

ASSETS.GFC
ASSETS.GOB

From what i've found so far, the GFC file is the "map" of where the files are located in the GOB files..

Within the GOB files, there are "chunks" of data that start with STBL and end with ENBL

Attached is the first 256k bytes of data from the GOB file.
