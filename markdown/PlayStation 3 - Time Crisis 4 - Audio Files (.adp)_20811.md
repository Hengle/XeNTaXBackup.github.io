- Post Title: PlayStation 3 - Time Crisis 4 - Audio Files (.adp)

The .adp audio files in Time Crisis 4 appear to be different from other .adp files used in different games. I have attempted to convert them with vgmstream to no avail. Possibly because this is an updated version or a specific derivative for PlayStation 3. Nonetheless, help converting this format to a playable audio file would be greatly appreciated.

A sample of one of these files can be obtained here:

Thanks!

Your definitely doing something wrong, because it plays just fine, converts just fine.

It doesn't play for me. Just shoots up an error claiming an unsupported or corrupted file, even with the ADPCM decoders.

...unsupported or corrupted file...
Did you install the vgmstream audio plug-in?

Try installing the vgmstream component for foobar2000, which can be found here:

With it, like mono24 said, it plays fine.

I eventually did get it to play, but it's very crackly.
