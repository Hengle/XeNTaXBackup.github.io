- Post Title: Help ripping the game models from the Attack on Titan 2 game

Hey everyone! I'm really hoping someone can help me out here, I'm pretty desperate. 

I'm trying to use NinjaRipper. I've been trying to rip the character models from the Attack on Titan 2 game (it's on Steam), but for some reason it doesn't work. First, the game itself doesn't run, I'm not sure if it's because it runs through a launcher? Like it opens up then I have to confirm (like this: [http://oi64.tinypic.com/2w5kdgg.jpg](http://oi64.tinypic.com/2w5kdgg.jpg)). So, I run the program, "run" the game and open it from Steam because it's the only way I can run it. Not sure why it doesn't launch from NinjaRipper, even when I "confirm" the launcher. After opening it from Steam, I go to the model gallery and press F10, and the game freezes successfully, but it never unfreezes, and I never get anything on the output folder. I'm not sure if the game behaves differently because it's from a Japanese developer, but I'm desperate and really want these models. Can you please help me? I followed all the steps from YouTube and DeviantArt tutorials and even asked for help there, but I haven't really gotten any results.

Some info:
- NinjaRipper only creates an output folder with the log if I run it through the intruder inject. If I try with directx, nothing is created.
- The data from the game is in .bin format ([http://oi64.tinypic.com/zn2e7q.jpg](http://oi64.tinypic.com/zn2e7q.jpg)). Could I somehow rip them through that? 

If there's another program I could use, I'm also open for suggestions. I just want these damn models!!!

Thank you in advance.

I'm in the same spot, I've been trying to extract those models for a month, but I don't have very much success...

I tried Steven's Gas Machine, but it doesn't work for AOT2 and the author seems to have abandoned the project.
I also tried NinjaRipper, somehow the 1.6.1 works better than the 1.7.1, I can retrieve some models, but textures are darkish and 3d clothing are very buggy so unusable. Also the "All" function doesn't work and I have to use the "Forced" one.

I'd really love to be able to rip those 3d models, especially with the new DLC coming soon which will add quite a lot of new models...

Thank you !!
