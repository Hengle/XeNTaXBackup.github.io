- Post Title: D1 Gran Prix xxx.BIN 3D Models

After a script aluigi provided I managed to extract all the data in the game into preset folders, all decompressed (very neat work by the devs!).
D1 Gran Prix is a game developed by Yukes if that helps at all.

But still is the issue of a generic .bin file for car 3D models, varying from 1.7MB-1.4MB (accurate size for a detailed car model). Textures aren't a problem, can just be ripped from the emulator using Texmod.

AFAIK the models are correctly titled with the car names and all come with the same headers as seen here (code here is from the sample file aswell):
