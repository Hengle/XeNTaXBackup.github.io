I was wondering if anyone had found, or would be willing to find, the archive method used in the Sonic & Knuckles Collection.  I have uploaded what I believe to be the GRA  [here](http://www.geocities.com/ravynousdezign/SONIC3K_DS2.zip).

Simple format, I even managed to extract some DXT textures. I guess I'll write a small app for it.

Please do not repeat the same message so many times... I'll supply some more examples to make sure this gets completed.

Sorry I was gone for a while there, I got infected and had to reformat and whatnot.

It's the only *.DAT file in the installation, unfortunately.  If it's of any help at all, I'll give you the main EXE for it.  Matter of fact, it's right [here](http://www.geocities.com/ravynousdezign/SONIC3K.zip).

It wasnt sarcasm. I was designing the editor around a plugin system. I then relized if there are more .dats the plugins won't work. But since there is only 1 it will work perfect.

Ah! Thats good, and when you say editor you mean it'll be likely to edit the DAT file and it's contents? Not just extract?

Models? I was not aware there was 3D data in the Sonic games it covers... huh... maybe they did some enhancements for the special stages hm... I'll have to look into this. I thought they just ported and emulated each game with a built-in emulator, but this leaves me curious if they did more... O_o

Does this cover sprites as well? Sounds quite interesting.

Gotta be sure, ya know.  Also, if ya'd release either the specs or source, I'd be much obliged.  I'd like to learn a bit about GRAF hacking, might come in useful some day, ya never know!   

Oh, and as for the models, they might be for the various 3D background objects in the special stages, like the Slot Machine stage.

[edit]Actually, now that I think about it, the "verts" might be used for collision detection boundaries; it was a common (?) practice in the heyday of 2D gaming to utilize some 3D library functions to make their collision detection systems more accurate.

Crikey! Ain't she a beaut!?

Well, I'm actually curious too. I didn't know it was possible to change the graphics. I'm interested to find out if they actually remade it for the PC rather than emulate it. If that is so, then this will make modding it pretty fun. XD Only thing is missing is a script file that gives all character/baddie data, but what are the chances of that?

Oooh yeah, I'd love it if the scripts ended up being in there.  If not, they might be in the exe itself, or in one of the other files in the installation.  There's only 2 other files in the installation that might hold data, one's 2kb in size, the other's 13kb in size.  They can be found [here](http://www.geocities.com/ravynousdezign/Sonic3K_other_files.zip).

Heres a small app I was working on. It allows you to make plugins for each file in the dat. It has bitmap viewing and extraction, but sadly I never got injection working. It is in C# 2008. Note: Each plugin must be named "File" then the actuall File number ex 1, 2, 3 etc. One more thing, lets say your mapping out a file, and you come across a bitmap. Well you need to get the bitmap size and subtract it from the next offset. Example Bitmap offset: 2000, Bitmap size: 2000, next value offset: 4012, you subtract the bitmap size, so the next value offset would be 2012.



There are only 2 things I can think of that need to be fixed. But I'm done.

When I try the extract all option, I get the following error:

```
Parameter name : value.

```


It extracts all the files, I'm guessing, however, they have no extension.

Another thing, the file being opened is a *.ds2 file, not a *.dat; also, when I open the file, I'm guessing I'm supposed to get a preview of the file, what it looks like, however, the form remains blank.

I attempted to try and fix these problems, but your version of Visual Studio is apparently very different from mine (I'm using VS.Net 2003 Academic), and it throws several compile errors.

Well theextract all works, there are no extensions because none of the files have any.

Also this was made with C# 2008, so yea 03 is a little outdated.

It could be the .ds2 file that is messing up things but I don't know.

Thats odd, considering the .ds2 file I'm assuming you used is the one from my installation (obviously), and it apparently works for you, so why not for me?

Most peculiar...
