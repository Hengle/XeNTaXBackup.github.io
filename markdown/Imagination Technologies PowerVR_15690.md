In cross-reference I've come across many mobile games that utilize this engine/SDK which is becoming steadily more popular that have reached a seeming dead end in extraction (examples: TMNT Legends, Jurassic World, Spider-man Unlimited). I'm a weak coder but I believe that cracking this engine will lead to getting scripts for the games in turn. Fortunately it's all free and very comprehensive as well the free tool kits include ready built plugins/scripts for Blender, 3ds max and Maya. Here is some links to information about the engine in question:

*edit: Just adding I tracked back a bit and the .dat files for JW and TMNT are PowerVR .pod files for anyone wondering. If you open them in a text editor it's in the first line or so.
