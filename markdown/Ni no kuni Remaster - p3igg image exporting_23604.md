Well, here are some tools [https://github.com/wmltogether/Ninokuni-Images-Tool](https://github.com/wmltogether/Ninokuni-Images-Tool)
Also there is some script here [viewtopic.php?p=82952#p82952](https://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?p=82952#p82952)

So you can try to use these and if it doesn't help, then some adjustments need to be made.
