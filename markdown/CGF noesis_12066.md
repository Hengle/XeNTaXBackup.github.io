If you're trying to look at the Star Citizen game objects from the 0.9 release or later, it's using Cryengine 3.6+, which has a new file format and the cryengine.dll file won't work.

If it's for a Cryengine 3.5 or earlier, it does work for the most part, except some models get a bit exploded and it doesn't handle the .mtl files.  But you can still use them in things like Blender without too much trouble.

I don't know where the official repository is for the cryengine.dll file is these days though.

i have files from 3.6 loading with the same level of support as before.  still looking into the scale issues that causes some of them to look exploded.  will see if i can put a new version up in the noesis plugin repository ([https://code.google.com/p/noesis-plugins-official/](https://code.google.com/p/noesis-plugins-official/)) when i get the chance.
