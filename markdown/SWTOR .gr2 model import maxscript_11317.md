- Post Title: SWTOR .gr2 model import maxscript

Hi guys! Here's maxscript to import SWTOR models with bones (3ds max 2009-2011)

Instruction:
1. Load SWTOR_BONES.ms
2. Point it to a file like ***_skeleton.gr2
3. Bones will be loaded

4. Load SWTOR.ms
5. Point it to a file like ***.gr2 without word "skeleton"
6. Model will be loaded above bones

Done

Sorry for posting twice but it works great on Satele, but when I test it on Malgus he doesn't get every weight he should, he has Right Toe, Pelvis, Right Hip, and those bones are even weighted on the correct part (pelvis is weighted to most of the upper body)
Is this a bug in the script? Im glad that the script works great for Satele though

Hi, no it's not a bug in the script. Mine Malgus model I had to fix manually, because base bmsnew_skeleton doesn't have extra bones for cape, which Malgus model needs (those weights which you got importing Malgus model on base bmsnew_skeleton are default 3ds max generated)   So I guess somewhere should be skeleton for Malgus, that's the skeleton-finding problems I told you. There's a "my way" to fix this, but it's a little crappy lol

Oh I see lol. That's fine then, maybe Malgus' cape has a skeleton somewhere else lol.

So this script is for characters and creatures only? I'm getting some errors when i'm trying to load ships.

But anyway, it's wonderful script! I've been looking for something like this literally 2 years!

Hi! Thanks for sample, I fixed script to import Agent's ship. But it would be great, if you send me more ships to test.

I tested all model samples and they imported fine. Check first post for updated scripts.

Hi! Can you modify your script to import models with Z-axis up? Because it is a pain in a... rotating all the models (100+) I've imported, especially ones with bones.
