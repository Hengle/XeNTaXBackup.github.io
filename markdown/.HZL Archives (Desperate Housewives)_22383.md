- Post Title: .HZL Archives (Desperate Housewives)

Has anyone ever encountered this format? Judging by the results of a quick Google search, it's completely undocumented. The game was made by Liquid Entertainment, but I'm not sure whether any other of their games ever used the same engine.

Here is a link to the music archive (I hope this is allowed):

there should be a rule to upload files only to generally accessible file hosting

Files in .hzl archives are generally compressed by zlib. 
In case on music(.ogg) and video(.bik) not compressed at all.

Thanks! I managed to retrieve the music using an OGG extractor.

Tried to figure this out according to wikixentax: [http://wiki.xentax.com/index.php/H2O8](http://wiki.xentax.com/index.php/H2O8)

This seems to work (before using, put .lqr and .hzl files with the same name to one folder):

```
open FDDE hzl 1


goto 0x28 0
get FILE_OFF long 0
goto FILE_OFF 0
get ACTUAL_FILES long 0
get FILES long 0


idstring 1 "LIQDLH2O"
getdstring COMMENTS 0x227 1
get FILES1HZL long 1
get ACTUAL_FILES1HZL long 1
get DUMMY long 1
get DECSIZE longlong 1
get DECSIZE longlong 1
get DUMMY longlong 1


for i = 0 < FILES
	get TAG long 1
	get DirectoryNameIndex long 1
	get FilenameIndex long 1
	get ID1 long 1
	get SIZE long 1
	get ZSIZE long 1
	get OFFSET longlong 1
	get CRC long 1
	get DUMMY long 1

	string NAME p "%04d" ID1

	get ID long 0
	get CHECK byte 0
	if CHECK <> 0
		getdstring UNK 0x9 0
		get NAMESIZE long 0
		math NAMESIZE *= 0x2
		getdstring NAME NAMESIZE 0
		set NAME unicode NAME
		getdstring DUMMY 0x14 0
	endif

	if ZSIZE == SIZE
		log NAME OFFSET SIZE 1
	else
		savepos TMP 1
		goto OFFSET 1
		get CompressedLength long 1
		get DecompressedLength long 1
		get CRC long 1
		savepos OFFSET 1
		clog NAME OFFSET ZSIZE SIZE 1
		goto TMP 1
	endif
	
next i
```


Although at the moment I'm not sure if all the filenames are correct for unpacked files - I haven't written anything to check if file-IDs are the same.
But as for me, no problems appeared yet.
