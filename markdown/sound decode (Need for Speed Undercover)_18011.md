- Post Title: sound decode (Need for Speed Undercover)

Hello guys,
I desesperately need help, because I just want to extract / decode somes sounds from NFS Undercover (sirens, horns, skid sounds etc) but the tool of daemon1 is not working with this game, the encodage must be different and no tool currently exist. It's also the same for The Run, and ProStreet. There is a lot of exensions : .abk, .bnk, .tmx, .sbs, .dbr... I put a sample for anyone want to help me.

Ps : I don't know how to code, I just would like a tool.

Thanks. Yes of course, here you go. I put all sounds into this .rar : [https://mega.nz/#!uFFSSB5T!qYznb4emM4v2 ... 7jUGqE4X9Q](https://mega.nz/#!uFFSSB5T!qYznb4emM4v2K1aN1aKyusFHDjQJU8AMO7jUGqE4X9Q) (with all)
but if it's too much, here, just less samples : [https://mega.nz/#!zd0BnIwL!h8_NHPjybJSb ... qYF15qcZ1Q](https://mega.nz/#!zd0BnIwL!h8_NHPjybJSbD7bARTA59C-XJL-j2UKPFqYF15qcZ1Q) (with abk etc)

Just so you know, from NFS The Run, every single sound can be converted, because its part of Frostbite engine, every single documentation on how to achieve that is already posted in the forum, every bit of information, literally.

Ok thanks, i'm gonna take a look !  But if anyone can make a tool, it would be just awesome.

PS : Can you give me links about sounds extractions of NFS The Run ? c:
