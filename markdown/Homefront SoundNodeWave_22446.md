Can anyone help me unpack and repack Homefront SoundNodeWave files?
I tried many unreal_loc_int_import_INT au3 script, but no luck!

Please don't duplicate requests. You have asked about Homefront last month [viewtopic.php?f=35&t=22262](https://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=35&t=22262)
so I if you have something to say about localization for this game, please keep it in one topic.
