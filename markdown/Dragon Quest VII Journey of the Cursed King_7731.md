I'd like to know if anyone ever succeeded in extracting the contents of the data.dat and data2.dat files from DQ8. I opened them with a ex editor and I saw header information about music files and probably 3D meshes too but I'm not a programmer and I couldn't figure how to decompile all of these files. I'm mostly interested in the 3D meshes so if any good programmer has the game, it would be awesome to get some tips or a bms script or something to extract the contents.
