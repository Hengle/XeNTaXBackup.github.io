- Post Title: Quake Champions PCT files

After checking out the (kinda recent) Quake Champions PAK explorer, i found PCT files, in which it says its textures, however, i think the models may be stored here aswell.


Here's a reference file for study: [https://mega.nz/#!PcoHgBjD!gIXa_XqjWBv5 ... ESFRTHe27U](https://mega.nz/#!PcoHgBjD!gIXa_XqjWBv5KjA0AWJbPSqMflWXgiThOESFRTHe27U)

Hi Matsilagi!

I'm the author of QCPAK, and I'd like to introduce you the new tool - QCPCT.

You can download it from here: [http://www.moddb.com/games/quake-champi ... /qcpct-v01](http://www.moddb.com/games/quake-champions/downloads/qcpct-v01)

With this tool you can easily explore and convert any or all of the PCT textures stored inside Quake Champions *.pak archives.

Just open any PCT file and choose one of the available 3 formats to save:
1) TGA - simplest format that will allow you to use the texture in any other imaging program
2) DDS - more complex format that will allow you to save the full game texture with all of it's mipmaps and faces (if it's cubemap)
3) HDR - use this format to save those HDR textures from the game
