- Post Title: SpongeBob's Truth or Square Xbox 360 Unknown Texture Format

Hello once again!   

I have looked into the Xbox 360 version of SpongeBob's Truth or Square, and am lost on what the texture format could be. I know it for sure it is a texture file as my basic level editor I designed for this game can successfully extract known asset types. Any help discovering what they could be is greatly appreciated! I have attached some samples in a *.zip archive. Thanks in advance!

I have done some research of my own and have tried raw texture cooker with the Xbox 360 textures, and nothing but scrambled pixels comes up. Interestingly enough, I can't open the dds that is created with it. I am very lost so please any help is appreciated!   I have attached an image of what comes up when trying to convert it. I believe these textures could be headerless DDS textures, or something else headerless. Anyway, thanks for any help!
