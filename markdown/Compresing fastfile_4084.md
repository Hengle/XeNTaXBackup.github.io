Okay i assume you mean Call of Duty fast files. The only way i know to get them is to dump the memory and read them out.

Oh found that, [http://wiki.modsrepository.com/index.ph ... ile_Format](http://wiki.modsrepository.com/index.php/Call_of_Duty_5:_FastFile_Format). Repacking could be possible with the cod4 mod tool, or via zipping again?

I didnt look at the files, but the modtools for cod4! are aviable [http://wiki.infinityward.com/index.php/ ... on_History](http://wiki.infinityward.com/index.php/Mod_Tools_Download_and_Revision_History). I dont now if this will work with cod 6, but i think they will have some kind of protection, to stop people to run mods.

Compress it using zlib and re-add the header if it's an unsigned file. If it's signed you're fucked.
