- Post Title: American McGee's Scrapland (.sm3)

I don't regularly post here, so please pardon me if I sound a bit rusty.

So I recently got back into playing a bit of Scrapland, and also tried to see if I could mess around with the game's files a bit. Now I'm wondering how to rip models, stuff like the characters, ships, and whatnot, and sm3, I think, is what format the models are in. I was wondering if there were any scripts, or anything useful to convert them? Been wanting to port some of them to SFM, and I think there was already an SFM model of Betty at some point, or maybe Gmod, I can't remember.
