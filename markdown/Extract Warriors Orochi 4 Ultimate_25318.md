- Post Title: Extract Warriors Orochi 4 Ultimate

God blessing you, friends.
like the title says, i want to know that is there any method to extract models and animations of warriors orochi 4 ultimate ?
maybe it is not a hot game now or ever, but it is a treasure box since there are so many characters and unique battle animations.
hope someone can  share the method about extracting, thank you!
