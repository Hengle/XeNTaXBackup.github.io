- Post Title: For Honor SFX?

Has somebody got to extract the sound effects from For Honor? I think the sound effects (like Weapons clash sounds during block, Screams of the soldiers etc..) are now stored in .forge files because of how big those files are with the name "gameassets sounds". Though there's .pck files but they were small files.
