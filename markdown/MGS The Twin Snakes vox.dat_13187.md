- Post Title: MGS The Twin Snakes vox.dat

I still haven't found anything that successfully extracts the Vorbis streams from vox.dat. demux_dat_be will only recognize the subtitle data. I've heard that [Obscure Extractor GTK](http://sourceforge.net/projects/extractor-gtk/) works on vox.dat as well as extracts the VP3 format movies from movie.dat, but I can never get the thing to work.

Some tool will extract the files, but they'll skip chunks of audio during playback. [demux_dat_be.exe](http://www.hcs64.com/files/demux_dat_02.zip) extracts the Vorbis streams from demo.dat and \shared\movie.dat and they play correctly, but it doesn't work on vox.dat. I've tried cutting out the subtitle data at the beginning of the file, but it still gave me a read error.

Download: [vox.dat](https://www.dropbox.com/s/inbfby6ygx0dv1q/vox.dat?dl=0)

If anyone here knows how to extract vox.dat's contents to play back correctly, please let me know.

well, it's not that it's skipping around, that's how it's stored. it decoded fine. the game then splices together bits from each file once it loads them into memory. I don't know why they did it this way, but they did.

Should not forget this thing. So it's great if we could talk again.
