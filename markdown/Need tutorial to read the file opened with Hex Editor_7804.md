- Post Title: Need tutorial to read the file opened with Hex Editor

Hi to all,
I think before I can do any useful thing, I first need to understand how to decipher the outcome of hex editor.
Example
23 46 55 4E 43 01 00 00 00 31 46 49 4C 45 2A 20
In this case editor came up with
#FUNC....1FILE*

but the lines like this
9F 7B 30 14 9F 7B 30 02 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
editor 
Ÿ{0.Ÿ{0.........
does not mean anything useful !

Any help in this regard will be of great use for newbies.
