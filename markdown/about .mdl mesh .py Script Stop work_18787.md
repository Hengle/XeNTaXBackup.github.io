It turned out that my computer was out of order. I used another computer and stopped working. Instead, I had an error log.It says 111 a=g.i16.But the 111 place is 12, so if we change 12 to 16, we will succeed！！！！！！！！

Hello, I've got a question and I apologize if this appears to be random, but...

where did you get the blender script? Is it okay if you may link it to me?

Thanks :3, That seems to be it I guess, but I just have one more question, and I apologize if I sound like a noob, but how do I even load models with this? I can't seem to figure that out, does it have anything to do with the fact I have a later version of blender?

yeah you got to install Blender version 249 and launch it with the blend file 
that comes with the plugin, then press alt+p and select an mdl or anm file.

I got Blender 2.49b but when I press Alt+P it just tells me there was a python script error and to check the console, and when I check the console it directs me to the very first line
