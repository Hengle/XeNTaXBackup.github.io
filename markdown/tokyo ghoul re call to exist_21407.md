- Post Title: tokyo ghoul re call to exist

Hey. So i've been playing the new tokyo ghoul game and wanted to start ripping from it but have had some troubles doing so. So firstly i unpacked its .cpk file with something called CriPakTools and that worked but now i have all these .pac files and have no idea how to extract the models and such.
