- Post Title: Unreal Alpha *.ucx File

Hi. I was wondering if anyone could figure out how to open this file that's from a recent Unreal Alpha leak. I think this file type was originally going to be an Unreal package file, like *.u files are today. UTPT and UEViewer don't recognize this as an Unreal file, but that's all I know.

The file is uploaded [here](http://www.mediafire.com/?eccq2hzx50rjokz).
