- Post Title: Xdecompress Issues

Hi, I've been having issues with the XDecompress.exe form the 360's SDK

when ever i try to Drag/drop, it asks me if i want to replace the file i say yes and the file deletes...

i Used to have a BMS script for it but i cant find it anymore anyone have it?

i think it was called x_compress.bms?
