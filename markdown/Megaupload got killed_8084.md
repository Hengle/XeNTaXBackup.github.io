RIP.

Let's hope mediafire doesn't share the same fate.

Let us hope not, a friend of mine foolishly saved his only copy of a project he was working on there, and now he's scurrying to get it back

"I felt a great disturbance on the Net, as if millions of links suddenly cried out in terror and were suddenly silenced. I fear something terrible has happened..."

I feel especially bad for those who had paid accounts and stored nothing but legit files. No more files and no refund! This makes me wonder which file hosting site will be next, everyone should backup their important files on a flash drive or something just to be safe.

They didn't just kill it, they confiscated the servers.
Guess they will be knocking on more than just a few doors in the near future... 

I wouldn't worry about the legit file serving sites, they will do their own internal pruning.
Megaupload is different, it's owners were actively encouraging the authorities to prosecute them.

Filesharing sites all over the place are becoming just file hosts. Meaning, no sharing.
(Or they're just IP-banning america)

It's no different from skydrive or dropbox, except those are more useful for everyday purposes AND archiving.

Who knows when the next one might become target of the world police.

And the Sopa didn't pass really. Those guys didn't know in what they got stucked into, the anonymous group has been hacking gouvernamental web pages since then and also they're going to launch this new site:

Sony provoked a hacker community and had their PSN data base stolen, I don't know what could happen right now.
