This tool can export/import the texture data in .brres file.

bresdump: dump the infomation of .brres file.
bres2png: export the texture to png file.
bres4png: import the texture from png file.

you need the cygwin runtime dlls to run this tools.

Could someone please compile these for us? I can't figure out how to do so. I'm very uneducated when it comes to programming.
