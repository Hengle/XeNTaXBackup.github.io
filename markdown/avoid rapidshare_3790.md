- Post Title: avoid rapidshare

@mr.mouse: I don't know if this is the correct section

I wanted to make light on a problem regarding one of the various files hosters which is enough used also here on Xentax to share the files to analyze.
Seems that lately Rapidshare has increased a lot the various limitations for the downloads without accounts ("Free users") with the conseguence that it's really impossible to download the files linked here.

the first limitation is that "no available slots for free users" error which starts to happen often (like in this moment) and obviously if after 2 or 3 times the problem persists I say bye-bye to the file.

the other one instead is very shameful because it's a senseless limitation in the download rate.
many people should have noticed that although the web browser displays speeds like 300 or 400kb/s the files take ages to be downloaded.
the reason is very simple, rapidshare inserts a variable delay of 2 or 3 seconds after each second of download:
1sec_of_download/3sec_of_nothing/1sec_of_download/3sec_of_nothing/1sec_of_download/3sec_of_nothing/...
that's why a file of 10mb takes half hour instead of one minute.
this problem has been verified in Italy from different ISPs but should be the same also in other countries (I doubt that it's a limitation based on a geoip localization).

so please avoid to use this file hoster to share the archives/files to analyze.

instead would be cool to compile a list of file hosters that have less or no limitations.
for example if I'm not in error sendspace not only doesn't have limits in the time to wait (not that I care) but even doesn't require to have javascript enabled, so definitely a good one in my opinion.

I could not agree more with your post. I too have noticed that Rapidshare is no longer a good option. The idea to list "approved" hosts is excellent. Can you start a thread on that? I can make you mod if you like, so you can make the thread a sticky one.

the problem is that I'm not a good users of these services, if wasn't for the analysis of the game files provided by the people probably I would rarely/almost never used them :)

maybe for the moment is better to wait what the other users think about this idea.

other than for rapishare.com I have seen that a very bad/ugly hoster is netload.in which adds something like even 2 counters and was bad also for the performances... really to avoid.
then there is another one that I don't remember and luckily was used only in one post and it even required something that didn't work with firefox (don't know if was a activex thing or java or a particular javascript feature).

these ones were the most problematic, I don't remember so bad things with the other hosters, or in any case nothing to notice.

Very well. I will make a global thread for everyone to add his or her comments about file sharing hosts. We should be able to list a number of them that we can recommend. Sendspace is good indeed.

I agree with aluigi: [viewtopic.php?p=32542#p32542](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?p=32542#p32542).
Currently NEZLAOD.IN is the fastest download server for free users and even doesn't require JScript (with OPERA). Other download servers restrict their download bandwith to about 50~100kbyte/sec.

Yes. Restricted download speed to ~256kbyte/s.

Another fast server is SHARE BASE. To.
~150kbyte/s per file.  But if you have to download many files at once you can outsmart it.

Mediafire seems to be a viable option, as it has relaxed rules on downloading, like parallel downloads and stuff.

Very good thread  . I agree that sendspace is a very good hoster.. the only problem is, that files become inactive/get deleted after 30 days of inactivity (=30 days of not being downloaded by anyone). I think for this forum it is most important, that files are available as long as possible (at least that's more important than e.g. download speed).
I found one hoster ([http://www.crazysharing.com](http://www.crazysharing.com)) who claims to delete files not until 1000 days of inactivity...but with those small hosters you never know, how long they'll exist.
By the way: [Here's](http://birnchen.ath.cx/Filehoster.html) a list of  hosters... Holy Cow   -I never thought there were so many 1-click file hosters   !

in some sites enforce users that upload files first show a virus scan ( [http://www.virustotal.com/](http://www.virustotal.com/) ) , i just want to know whether it is important that this subject added in rules sections or not ?
this is an example of file i uploaded to [http://filecargo.com/](http://filecargo.com/) and the result of virus scan :

A list of good places to upload.

Hmm, a Drop box account would probably be best (Password protected of course), its easy to update, drag and drop no hassle.
Megaupload, this doesnt get utilized NEARLY enough, ive gotten so much good stuff from here in the past few years.
Zshare is a good one too, allows for large file sizes and there doesnt seem to be a download speed limit either.

Megashare (or something similar to that effect) is a good one too.

If I can think of anymore I'll mention them, im at work now so I cant really browse download sites.

I hate rapidshare with a loathing passion. IMO the best sites for file sharing are mediafire and 4shared, although I don't mind megaupload either. Anything but rapidshare. Download one file and have to wait like two hours for the next part? Forget that.

I find the mediafire and megaupload along with hotfile are good, if im trying to download alot of files with rapidshare though, id say fuck it, if its 1 or 2, sure why not.

Hi all of you!

So the main reason of avoiding rapidshare are:

slow download speed 
Deletion and inactivity of shared files   
bad and worst hoster

well i have used mediafire just small files downloading and the download complete within seconds but how long it takes for downloading big files?

Thanks

mediafire still as efective as ever   

I think dropbox used to be good too before it was nerfed   

Last Year I bought an Xperia Play and it came with a free 50 GB subscription to [www.box.com](http://www.box.com), which is like a ripoff dropbox but just as good and with no limitiations (yet) except the 100 MB file size limit.
