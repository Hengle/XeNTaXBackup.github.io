- Post Title: Problem to import the file

Here I am bothering you again.
When I import the file again he says it's bigger and it will not.
Screenshot:




How do you import the file back even though he was larger than the original?
Thank you for your attention.

That's the limitation of the import function: it simply tries to reinsert the modified file where it originally was.

To rebuild an archive you need a proper script or, for some complex archives, a specific compression tool.

Can you indicate some program that can recompress files with the CAPCOM ARC but for the PS3?
