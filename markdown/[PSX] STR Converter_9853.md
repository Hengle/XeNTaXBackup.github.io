- Post Title: [PSX] STR Converter

Description:
This tool allows fast and easy conversion of STR files. It converts STR to AVI and AVI to STR. It can also view Playstation videos in the built-in player.

It was originally a Japanese program by taka2 that was translated into Polish and English by ikskoks. All three versions are included in this archive.

In addition, courtesy of ikskoks, a useful tutorial describing using it in practice can be found [here](http://ikskoks.grajpopolsku.pl/art,id10,dodawanie_napisow_do_plikow_str.html).
