- Post Title: Extracting 3D/2D models from Gotham City Impostors

Hello!

New here.

I am desperately trying to export all 3D/2D models from GCI and import them into Blender. I have searched the posts here, and the only other GCI post I could find, it appears they also were not able to figure it out. I have also looked for posts from other Monolith games, no luck. I believe the files are arch01. Does anyone have any knowledge on a way to extract Blender importable files from these without having to take a GPU ripping route?

Happy to pay someone to do this for me. I need all the assets from this game for a personal project.
