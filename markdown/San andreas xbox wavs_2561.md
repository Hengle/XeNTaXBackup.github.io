- Post Title: San andreas xbox wavs

apologies if this has been addressed before, i did search the forum and came up blank.
 i am trying to inject custom sound effects into the GENRL archive for the xbox version of gta san andreas. while the tools for the pc version are adequate for extracting and swapping the existing sound effects, i have had no luck with my customs.

the wavs from the pc version are a standard wav format, they even play in windows media player. the xbox wavs give nothing but static, and are considerably smaller.

if anybody could help out, that would be great. 
i can provide samples from both the pc and xbox (if that is allowed)

The sample of xbox sounds horrible, but the info its:

```
Duration: 2.689s

```


and the PCM pc it's

```
Duration: 0.756s

```

If you see the duration, this is the reason the waved xbox it' smore smaller

Maybe bad dumped?

i've already tried EkszBox. it will extract the ogg files from the radio station archives, but nothing from any of the sfx archives.

although the xbox wavs sound horrible, when you re-inject them back into the GENRL archive with SAAT, they sound absolutely fine in-game.

heres a small video demonstrating this (swapping the rustler prop engine for the hydras jet engine sfx to complete a plane mod)
