- Post Title: The Legend Of Zelda Skyward Sword Encrypted Files

Hello,
Skyward Sword uses LZ and arc format that can be decompressed, however their are .endat and .entxt in enemy files that could be spawn points or other events. Their are also zev.dat files that could contain the enemy spawn.
Im not the best looking in files with hex editor so I thought I would post some files today that I need help figuring out.

Which are files for spawns? Are any of them encrypt? What do they represent?
