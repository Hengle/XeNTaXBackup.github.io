Hello everyone.  Nobody knows how to extract audio files from Battlefield 2042?  There are no .cat files like in BF V for example.  There are only .toc and .cas files.  Any ideas?

The format is different indeed, the author of: [https://github.com/NicknineTheEagle/Frostbite-Scripts](https://github.com/NicknineTheEagle/Frostbite-Scripts) is already aware of it, and he will add support for it at some point, keep an eye on it and who knows maybe in the near future it may happen, if not i guess based on that link someone skilled enough can take over, time will tell.
