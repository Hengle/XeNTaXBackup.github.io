- Post Title: Looking to get models out of two Xbox games

I would like to have extraction tools or Noesis plugins for the games Whacked! and ToeJam & Earl III: Mission to Earth. The former appears to use .str for its models, while the latter appears to use .funk for its models and .bmt for its textures.

Thank you for your time.
