- Post Title: extract audio from .int

I want to get the music and sound effects of a visual novel. Strangely, all the files in the game end in. int, such as movie. int, image. int. I tried using HXD and vgmtoolbox to get audio from se. int and music.int, but no success. If anyone can help this, here are the files: [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IwagK8 ... sp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IwagK8VFesRbAGWgwRD3ORj_wK_6D8RJ/view?usp=sharing)

Aluigi already created a BMS script for KIF files:

Or you can use the tools from the page below:

Probably commandline tools though.
