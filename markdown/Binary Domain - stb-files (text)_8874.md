If you simply replace the text, then this string is displayed in full, but the next will be displayed as a sign "&"
If you replace the text, while maintaining the length of the string, the string is displayed normally and all future will also be displayed.
So in the file starting at offset 0x017024 are either likely to bias lines in the file, or something else.
Lines in the file about 16 thousand. But the blocks with the size/offsets of about 20 thousand

We have the technology implementation of the text. If you want, I'll give you a text to translate. We insert it into the game.
We translate the game into Russian.
