- Post Title: Dynasty warriors 3d RIP

Yo guys, First off I want to say that I am aware there are 2 other threads about similiar Koei title extractions out there,
But I cant figure this out, and those threads seem to be dead.

anyway I am trying to RIP 3d models out of any DW title.

I found this:

When I run the .exe it opens a CMD box for half a second and makes the folder LinkData_BNS with nothing in it.


I found another guide posting about using offzip and another 2 bns type files, but the link was dead, so I downloaded 2 different offzip files off google and when I run any CMD prompt type window to get it going it just closes instantly, If I just run the .exe from the offzip folder it does nothing or crashes.



So any help here would be greatly appreciated. Thanks for your time.









UPDATE:

Hey,


No ripper or version of xentax seems to work for the version of the game I have.

When I run Xentax (unblocked and ran as admin) I point it to the right area (and made a folder called and LinkedData LinkedData_A) after the promts the CMD window runs for a split second then closes automatically,

I was able to catch a print screen of what it says and here it is:

I'm not sure why this is happening, it doesnt seem to be doing anything. Any help here would be greatly appreciated, I cant seem to get any responses on any forums >.<

Which Dynasty Warriors game is it? You'll have better luck extracting models from PSP ports with Noesis because I can't think of any way to rip the ones from PS1 and PS2 titles.
