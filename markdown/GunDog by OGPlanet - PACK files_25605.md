- Post Title: GunDog by OGPlanet - PACK files

Some years ago, I discovered this game on my old HDD, it appears there's no other source of this archive in the net.
So I decided to share it with you. The game was shut down in 2013 in open beta phase, and it's developer/publisher OGPlanet got defunct in 2017.

So whoever who is curious or nostalgic about this game, check it out.
Also, it appears that the archive gives out some malware detection, but I think it's false positive as nothing seem to happen to me.

Judging by main.cs file, the game uses // Torque Game Engine

And to unpack .pack files of the game, you need to use Offzip
