- Post Title: The Force Unleashed - How to extract .lp files

Hello all,

I recently got my hands on a copy of Star Wars: The Force Unleashed to try and extract some of the character models, and I was wanting to ask, exactly how do you go about the process of extracting the .lp files that the model files are encased in?

Any help on this matter is greatly appreciated.

Hello all,

... how do you go about the process of extracting the .lp files that the model files are encased in?Hello. No one can tell without having a .lp sample. (What size does the smallest one have?)

In terms of the actual maps themselves, the TIE Fighter Factory level (tiefactory_kota_act1_pc.lp) is the smallest, clocking in at 129 MB. The actual smallest lp file, however, is a costume pack (costumepackoctober.utf16_pc.lp) clocking in at 43 MB.

Here are those 2 LP files for you to analyze (I have also provided the Maris Brood boss fight from the Imperial Felucia map because Maris is one of the models I was wanting to extract):

So there has been a quickbms script for this game i think since it came out [http://aluigi.altervista.org/bms/star_wars_lp.bms](http://aluigi.altervista.org/bms/star_wars_lp.bms) here it is and there is also a Noesis plugin that if i remember right came default with it to open the models and animations but if it's not anymore here it is.
