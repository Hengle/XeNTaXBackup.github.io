The game uses JFIF, which I believe is Motion JPEG format, and isn't necessarily what is used when it creates a Titantron or Highlight reel, but more than likely is what it uses.  I haven't looked into the format, because I can use any BINK converted titantron I want for someone's entrance, including a CAW.  If you are wanting to make someone a titantron, then the easiest thing to do is convert it to BINK format, number it correctly, and put it in the titantron folder, no resigning or that crap needed, like there is with the Create-A-Titantrons.  When I release the new hack, everyone can have their own custom titantron, including CAWs:
