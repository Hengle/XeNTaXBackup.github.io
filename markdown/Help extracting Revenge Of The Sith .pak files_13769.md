- Post Title: Help extracting Revenge Of The Sith .pak files

So far no program can comprehensively open these files. However, I have it on good authority that the .pak files from the XBox version of Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith are not compressed so it is possible to extract things from them, and looking at the .pak file in a hex editor, it does look like this is the case. Objects can be converted into .obj format through hex2obj and textures through TextureFinder but it's a real task trying to find the parts in the file.
