- Post Title: Corpse Party Blood Drive models?

I`ve been trying to rip the character models from Corpse Party Blood Drive but I`m having a hard time figuring out where to start...I`ve dumped all the .asset files that I could but I can`t seem to find any of the character models? They might be in Resources.assets but I can`t get any Unity tools to open or extract it so I`m at a loss :/

Could anyone help me out?

They're in resources.assets, go through it with unity asset explorer (or disunity? whichever exports to FBX), i got them all a little while ago, so its quite fresh in my mind.

The textures should all be automatically assigned to the models, and they'll be in DDS format.
