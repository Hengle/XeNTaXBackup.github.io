- Post Title: Nicktoons DS Games: "Main.PAK" files?

Well, in accordance with the forum rules, I cannot post examples here properly. Though I can let you know how to get them yourself provided you have the means to. The easy part is extracting the ".NDS" internal files, as a program called 'dslazy' can do that quite quickly. Getting the ".nds" files themselves are a bit more tricky, and we all know the unpleasant yet easy way of doing so via internet downloads.

Anyway...that ugliness aside, let's get down to business. What I'm looking for is a method of unpacking the 'main.pak' files held within the NDS files. These are obviously the files containing the resources for each game. Specifically "Nicktoons: Attack of the Toybots', and 'Spongebob Squarepants featuring Nicktoons: Globs of Doom'. If anyone is capable of helping, please let me know as soon as possible.
