- Post Title: Quake Champions .PAK (Saber Engine)

I've received a bunch of .PAK files from a friend from QC, and I wonder if anyone here is able to reverse engineer the Saber 3D engine .PAK archives

Because my internet is super slow, and the files are on his cloud storage, would be providing what I think is the header of the PAK archive to see if it's the same format as older games using the Saber engine?

Already tried but can't find index file which holds offsets + filenames. It uses deflate compression. I used offzip on it. Some data are not compressed.

Well I just noticed something pretty strange
If you check out the BethesdaNet launcher, you can see that it is also populated with a bunch of PAK files.

This could mean that it's a totally different known file format used in the past with tools released for it, and its extension was just changed for whatever reason

You can use my tool to open any *.pak file from the game and extract anything from it.



You can download the file from here - [http://3d-orange.net/files/QCPAK_v001.zip](http://3d-orange.net/files/QCPAK_v001.zip)

I'd like to introduce you the new tool - QCPCT.

You can download it from here: [http://www.moddb.com/games/quake-champi ... /qcpct-v01](http://www.moddb.com/games/quake-champions/downloads/qcpct-v01)

With this tool you can easily explore and convert any or all of the PCT textures stored inside Quake Champions *.pak archives.

Just open any PCT file and choose one of the available 3 formats to save:
1) TGA - simplest format that will allow you to use the texture in any other imaging program
2) DDS - more complex format that will allow you to save the full game texture with all of it's mipmaps and faces (if it's cubemap)
3) HDR - use this format to save those HDR textures from the game

AFAIK: The old way to get models through PAK extractor don't work. Neither works QuickBMS extractor anymore, an least for now.
[https://zenhax.com/viewtopic.php?f=9&t= ... 658#p35658](https://zenhax.com/viewtopic.php?f=9&t=4360&p=35658#p35658)
There is one way, which works partially: grab models by using latest NinjaRipper, and converting by using latest Noesis. But most models extracted by this way don't have UV coordinates and are "squished". So only some textures and parts of models without UV texture coordinates are available.
If anyone have something on this topic, please share info

I like to know this too.
Right now I'm fiddling around with Ninja Ripper to extract the Nyx character model and importing into Blender.


It has a few issues here and there, but it should be manually fixable:
.Below was fixed with the option 'Set to Face' (Set Normals from Faces in Blender)

I'm using the following software:
- Blender 2.79b
- Ninja Ripper v1.7.1 x64
- Quake Champions (Steam)
I switch between Noesis and Ninja Ripper Import Addon to see different results in Blender:
- Noesis v4.31 by Rich Whitehouse
- Ninja Ripper Import addon by Dummiesman for Blender

For some strange reason, I can't register on the ZenHax forum.

I will post my results here.
This is my first time using QuickBMS, so let me know if I'm doing something incorrectly.

I pointed QuickBMS to the shared.pak file (using the Steam version of Quake Champions).
[ steamapps\common\quakechampions\client\preload\paks\shared.pak ]
After selecting the output, my console output shows this:

```

What do I do?

Someone please report this to aluigi.

I was able to use the new script with QuickBMS on the shared.pak(12.1 GB).
The extracted folders:
[database] (10.9 MB)
[hkx] (7.30 MB)
[sound] (446 MB)
[textures] (14.6 GB)
[tpl] (1.10 GB)
[video] (727 MB)

I'm looking for the character meshes, and I think they are in the [tpl] folder.
The [tpl] folder contains 803 files with the following file formats:
TPL
TPL_DATA
CDT

This is my first time doing this, and I'm not familiar with the TPL or CDT formats.
How do I proceed with locating the meshes and then import them into Blender?

Curtain, how exactly did you used new script on shared.pak? Is your version of Quake Champions latest? I'm using latest version of QC on Steam, and Quick BMS responds with:

```
- please insert the content for the variable SEED2:

```

Did you had such thing? And if you did, how you managed to proceed?

The error you had was the same 1 I had when using the script from aluigi's post.
I used the new script from z65536's recent post.

Thanks for checking out Curtain. I used all scripts on that page. I deleted all QC files and downloaded it again - extracts fine.
You mentioned [textures] in previous post, did you managed to extract PCT files? I tried from moddb "QCPCT_v02", but it gives noisy image.

I haven't tried using any of the available extraction tools for textures yet. I figured I would focus on getting the meshes first and then use Ninja Ripper to rip the textures in case the other texture tools don't work.
Have you managed to locate and extract the character meshes?

Did anyone locate the character meshes?

I believe the game assets in the Steam version are located here:
steamapps\common\quakechampions\client\preload\paks
- awoken.pak (163 MB)
- basic_training_map.pak (267 MB)
- blood_covenant.pak (541 MB)
- bloodrun.pak (243 MB)
- burial_chamber.pak (494 MB)
- cache.pak (172 MB)
- church.pak (447 MB)
- corrupted_keep.pak (150 MB)
- fortress_of_the_deep.pak (218 MB)
- initial.pak (625 MB)
- lighthouse.pak (381 MB)
- lockbox.pak (274 MB)
- longestyard.pak (117 MB)
- main_menu.pak (46.4 MB)
- ruins_of_sarnath.pak (318 MB)
- shared.pak (12.1 GB)
- vale_of_pnath.pak (112 MB)

The shared.pak(12.1 GB) has the following folders:
[database] (10.9 MB)
[hkx] (7.30 MB)
[sound] (446 MB)
[textures] (14.6 GB)
[tpl] (1.10 GB)
[video] (727 MB)

The [tpl] folder (803 files) doesn't appear to have any recognizable 3d mesh formats:
- .TPL
- .TPL_DATA
- .CDT

Anyone know what .CDT and .TPL_DATA are?
Am I looking in the wrong place?

In Aug 26th 2017, a forum member suggested the possibility of the meshes being included in the .PCT files:

PCT are only textures. TCIP header means PICTURE. Btw textures are easily convertable by Rawtex. You must just set start offset of raw data + sometimes guess compression. But mostly they are BC7 - RGB/sRGB
About TPL files they have a string S3DRESOURCE means SABER 3D RESOURCE. MESH maybe?... I tried H2O but no luck. Since i still don't know where starts VTBlock and which size has.

For the textures, I may just use Ninja Ripper, since I'm not familiar with Rawtex.

Is this something aluigi or other ZenHax members know more about?
I'm having some difficulty registering on the ZenHax site. I was hoping to share your post with them: [https://zenhax.com/viewtopic.php?f=9&t= ... 8&start=20](https://zenhax.com/viewtopic.php?f=9&t=4360&sid=79c38d030625f7d288bcb518d11b88c8&start=20)
-EDIT- Not sure if they need a sample TPL file.

Added model & texture files : ripped "Eradicator" Railgun, and same model extracted from PAK packages.
Maybe it might be helpful

Can someone please share sound.pak? Seems like they always changing encryption and there's no proper script to unpack .pak file.

Hi, sorry for the inactivity.
I received a few private messages while I was gone, and to be clear, I'm not the author of any of these scripts. 
I came across these scripts while exploring the ZenHax forum.
I don't know if they still work or not.

When Quake Champions finally leaves Early Access, I will make another attempt to extract.
Hopefully, by then, someone will have an updated script/program tool.

Possibly another necro but I have found a way to be able to get files from before the game files were encrypted [https://www.reddit.com/r/Steam/comments ... a_game_on/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Steam/comments/611h5e/guide_how_to_download_older_versions_of_a_game_on/)

Follow the instructions on this reddit post and you will be able to get old files from the launch of the game, and you can use the old tools from before then instead of QuickBMS and searching for seeds. The downside to this being that you won't be able to extract any files from the encrypted updates from the game.

Huge ass necro but I wanted to ask how someone gets ahold of the seed value for the BMS script.

"insert the constant number for NrRandom initialization, it depends by the version of the game like 0x412e2206 and 0x631A2028
- please insert the content for the variable SEED2:"

Just wondering how someone gets ahold of this value. Do I have to read out some HEX value from the exe or whatever? 

Wanted to extract the latest game version which obviously doesnt work without the SEED2 value and I found no other tools that can do it. Generally information is scarce on the topic but supposedly the game files are encrypted nowadays, thats why it needs that value.
