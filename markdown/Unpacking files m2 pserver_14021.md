- Post Title: Unpacking files m2 pserver

Hello!

I need some help with unpacking files(custom file archive format, [click to download](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0By-X6ETeyy1LeEhJMkE5NU03RXM/view?usp=sharing)). I've tried to identify compression/encryption algorithms already but without success. I think it must be compressed or encrypted somehow. Would be nice if you could explain how did you identify it step by step.
