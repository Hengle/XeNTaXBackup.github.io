Hello there! Although this issue has been a long time ago, but I still want to ask, your software development success? Maybe you can send a request and discussion to the author of Ninja Ripper, I used it so his interception of 3D model tools is very popular. Maybe you have some new development minds that will help you more. . I don’t know how to develop software. It’s a pity.
