- Post Title: Decompiling Aion pak files (2.1.x)

Hi, I'm new here, i have been looking for informations on decompiling the pak files of aion.
there where a tool developed for this in this forum that works with the older revisions of the client. I wonder if anybody has solved it for the 2.1 version.
