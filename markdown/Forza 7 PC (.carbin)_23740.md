- Post Title: Forza 7 PC (.carbin)

I've been running into some problems here lately trying to import .carbin F7 models into anything. I seen on 3dsim it can import F7 models but fails.

Im pretty sure this is the import file could be wrong though.

After that it brings up this dialog.

No matter what option i select i get the same results.

Nothing

I even tried to import it with the old tools for laughs with no result.

Can anyone tell me if there is a way to import these properly or parse the data a different way ? 100GB of game data wasted if not. Here are samples to my .carbin. Along with the original scirpt i used from Aluigi.

Thanks in advance for any help.

just as a test I used my old forza3 app (from 4 years ago) and was surprised, it worked (with unplaced meshes, though):

You need to create a Cars folder. Place the BMW_M6_10 folder in the cars folder.
For example,
This PC=>Storage(E)=>cars=>BMW_M6_10=>BMW_M6_10.carbin

View link in my sig (tool for forza 3, can't access that link any more so not sure whether the download is still valid).

But it was not designed to work with forza 7. Also the positioning of doors and huds is  a little bit tedious,
