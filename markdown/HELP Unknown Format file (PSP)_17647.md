I'm brand new here, but maybe it would help to know:

1. Which game it is
2. The exact filepath to the file
3. Why you think it's an audio file.

Like I said, I'm not an expert, but I couldn't see any human-readable header information in the file in a hex editor, and file type detectors gave virtually no results. Also, the file is only ~10kb, which I feel is way too puny to be a song.
