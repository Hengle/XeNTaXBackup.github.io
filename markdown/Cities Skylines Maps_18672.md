- Post Title: Cities Skylines Maps

Hello, dwellers of xentax, I've got some simple question right here : is it possible to extract cities created in Cities Skylines in order to use them in a 3rd party applications? the only file is created when the map is saved is a .crp file (the same format as when you create an asset is the game) so I should conclude that all the information about the building coordinates is stored in this crp file. There is a tool on github that allows extracting map preview textures from a .crp file but the rest of the information is stored in the .bin file and is not extracted. 
Furthermore, there is an ingame tool called modTools which allows extracting 3d meshes placed on a map (that I cant get working in game) but no coordinates will be saved to allow me recreate the map with these meshes elsewhere in a 3d application. 
I might have missed something, however, for now, no idea how to recreate the map, somebody has got an answer? I'll much appreciate it.
