- Post Title: Homeworld Remastered big files

Hi all,
the big file format did not change since the previous Homeworld versions so the [old tools](http://www.moddb.com/games/homeworld/downloads/homeworld-universe-mod-tools) do work, but the new big files come encrypted for some reason.
I found [this tool](https://github.com/mon/bigDecrypter/releases) to decrypt them in case someone's interested.
Hope it helps.

Here's a new build. Much faster.
