- Post Title: Xproject game - UnityFS files

After the game is updated, some files have no "unityfs" header, and each file seems to be encrypted differently

I guess an app should not encrypt different files in many ways, but the changed files seem to be completely different except for the first seven characters.

example:
[https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/ ... sp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Us85E4CIqdu4S1cQUTIRDg3YbPwFHpLx?usp=sharing)

File 1 has not been changed yet
The other two are changed and encrypted

Well, it really depends on how encryption method has been implemented by the developers.
If they had enough time and patience they could implement any encryption they desired.
So it's totally possible that this game has multiple different encryption methods.

BUT it's more likely that they have just applied different encryption methods with different game updates,
so you have  there old files mixed with the new files.
Similar situation occured in another chinese game  [Punishing: Grey Raven](https://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?p=178340#p178340).


Btw, it's good to put in your post a package name when you ask questions about android games.
In this case it is com.jgg18.xproject

These files are in the same APK package, and I don't have old files. If each file is encrypted separately, decryption seems impossible
