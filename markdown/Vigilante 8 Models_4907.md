I have been trying to get the car models from this game. 3D Ripper DX doesn't seem to rip the 3d models from it.

Does anyone know of a way to get them?


Thanks in advance.

it would be interesting how you made this.
And about what "Vigilante 8" you say. Vigilante 8? Vigilante 8 - 2? Vigilante 8 - Arcade?
