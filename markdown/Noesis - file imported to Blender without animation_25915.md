- Post Title: Noesis - file imported to Blender without animation

Hi, I am using Noesis "dragon_lumberyard" plugin which are able to read .motion files. I can preview the animation thats going on in Noesis. 

Exported the .motion file to .bvh file and then imported it in Blender. This is when the problem comes, the bones are there fine but the animation that I saw in noesis is no longer in there. Looking at Action Editor in Blender shows only one keyframe. Does anyone know why this is the case? 

Any help is very much appreciated, thank you. Attached are the .bvh file
