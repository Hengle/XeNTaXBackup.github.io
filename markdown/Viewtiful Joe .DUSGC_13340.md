I've been wanting to rip Viewtiful Joe models for quite some time but I've found no way to decode .dusgc files. From what I can guess, they're archives used for storing sound effects, models and images.
Here's a link that includes some .dusgc files. Along with a .evtgc file (which I have no idea what it's for but look into it anyway.)

Also, if you need more .dusgc files, PM me and I'll send an archive containing all of them.

There is a string right before the data part that says "runlength comp." which could indicate some sort of RLE. Either that, or it is a decoy message.

My best guess is that you'd probably need to reverse engineer the game to try and decode the files?

Still on the topic of Viewtiful Joe's compression formats.
[https://www.dropbox.com/s/zmg58z52p0t3j ... h.zip?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/zmg58z52p0t3jzn/No%20Runlength.zip?dl=0)
Found these files that don't have any mentions of runlentgh comp in them. Perhaps these might be of interest?
