Hey guys, i think these are model files but i haven't the damndest how to convert them, the game doesnt exactly have alot of content being a tie-in game and all but i'd love to get my hands on the characters 
here's a sample file from the game, i think its a retractable arm weapon.
they are P2M format which  i cant find anything on anywhere, the game was made by a company called bizarre creations so idk if any of their other stuff has been cracked yet, or even looked at. They made the project gotham series so idk.

I don't know about extracting PS2 models, but you can rip game textures using TexMod. Have you heard of it?
