- Post Title: Facerig .Arc

I have been trying to extract the facerig .arc archives for its models but have made no progress.

It does not appear to be a usual .arc file.

Thank you in advance.

Apparently this arc format contains no data structures but only zlib-compressed streams. You should look for other files that store the file records.

Ekey over on the ZenHax forumn pointed me to Offzip.
Offzip has worked for one of the .arc archives and extracted files with extentions but no names.

Textures are DDS and models are in fbm and fsb format, looking into those.

An unpacked .arc has been uploaded to the same mega folder along with more game files.
