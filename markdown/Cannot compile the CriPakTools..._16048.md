- Post Title: Cannot compile the CriPakTools...

Hi everyone,

I am a newbie, and I am working on extract files from Nier: Automata. However, when I use Mono to compile the CriPakTools, it shows that it cannot find the LibCRIComp... Is there any suggestion? Is there anyone who can help me compile it and upload here?

Also, I have another question. After I changed something, how can I repack it back to a .cpk file?

Thank you so much.
