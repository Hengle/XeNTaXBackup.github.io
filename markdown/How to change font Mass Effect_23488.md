- Post Title: How to change font Mass Effect

I want to change the font of game mass effect 1 to Vietnamese font. 
I followed the guide on this blog [https://jpmod.blogspot.com/2012/04/mass-effect-4.html](https://jpmod.blogspot.com/2012/04/mass-effect-4.html) by the Japanese guy but failed. 
Can someone help me? 
Sorry for my bad english.
