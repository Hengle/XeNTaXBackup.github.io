Any chance to extract the .PAC Files from WWE SmackDown Here Comes the Pain on the PS2? 

Thanks for taking your time

There are two *.pac files.

Hi mate,

I downloaded the file you attached, and will look at it as soon as possible. I don't think we will be able to open it up for you though, especially if it is the same as the *.pac in the other WWE games, but I will see what can be done.

I believe it is, I tried Game Extractor on it, got some .BBE files to show, bout it.

Yes, that may be true, but that could only be showing some of the files in the archive.

In some WWE *.pac files I have looked at in the past, I was able to jump through the *.pac file a little and pick out some of the files, but this was the best that could be done as there was no directory-like structure present in the archive. What this basically means is that Game Extractor can guess some of the files, but as soon as it hits an error it just has to stop trying from that point onwards. There is no other way to do this - the archives are not readable without the main program or something.

I will have a look at the pac you attached anyway, hopefully they have changed their structures so that I can get Game Extractor to read it properly without guessing. Fingers crossed
