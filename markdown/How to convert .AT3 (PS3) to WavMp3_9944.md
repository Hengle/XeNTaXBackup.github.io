- Post Title: How to convert .AT3 (PS3) to Wav/Mp3?

Hi everyone. I'm Nahu, nice to meet you all.

I open this thread to ask for help with some .at3 files I have.

I want to convert this .at3 (PS3, no PSP) audio files to .wav or .mp3.
I tried some softwares such as Goldwave, SonicStage, the Atrac Converter tool, and the PSP converter tool.
In all cases, the software said that the files were unknown, it didn't recognized them or said that the file it's not supported :S

Is there any way to convert this files to wav?
I know that PS3 at3 files are slightly differente from those from PSP, but even so, until today, there is some way to do it?

I also tried with dbpowerarmp Music Converter, but I had this error (after changing the extension file to wav, because the program doesn't recognizes at3 directly):

"Error converting to Wave, 'D:\Mis Documentos\bgm2_5min.wav' to 'D:\Mis Documentos\Mis descargas\bgm2_5min.wav'
   Error RIFF chunk unknown 'MSFC'  [clRIFFHandler::ScanFile]"

I tried to load the file on Goldwave and it says that it doesn't recognize the format file.

Yes, I have installed the Atrac3 codec
