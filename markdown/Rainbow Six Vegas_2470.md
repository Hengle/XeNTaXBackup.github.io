I am an absolute newb to hex editing, and re-encoding and all that, but I really want to rip the OST from Vegas. The music is in .SS0 format, anyone familiar with it?

I've heard .SS0 is just a glorified version of OGG. When I attempt to open an .SS0 file in WMP, it sounds all... weird. I think I've heard the sampling rate needs to be adjusted, but I'm not sure to what (I can provide an .SS0 sample if required)
