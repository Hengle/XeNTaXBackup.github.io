Apparently Modern Warfare 2019 uses a new engine. Isn't compatible with other tools.

However i tried using to ninja ripper but dosen't seem to support/work. I might believe that the game uses Directx 12 which ninja ripper dosen't have.

Use this software, it works for MW 2019, but you need a game to launch.

Can confirm that Greyhound succesfully works with Modern Warfare 2019 as of 8.1.2019

However, I can't get facial animations because some character models like Mara use blend shapesa and I don't know where they are stored.

It rips models, but does not rip "base" textures (not models)

i tried to use intel's GPA software, it got hooked successfully but when i try to open the captured frame that i took 
,if i remember correctly it gave me an error/crashed(3 weeks ago)
it might be possible if i could somehow disable DirectX12 to use ninjaripper for textures atleast
