uv data is contained in the created obj file (File\SaveAs mesh).
In case you have a texture file (.jpg,. png, .dds, whatever) simply apply it to the model in your preferred 3D application.

This script is unlikely to work with all files and it only loads one mesh.
I suggest that you split the file if you find out where the other sub-meshes start.
The .bms file extracts the .png textures from the file.

The .py file that you must put in the python folder of the [Noesis](https://www.richwhitehouse.com/index.php?content=inc_projects.php&showproject=91) tool, the .bms file must be executed with the [Quickbms](https://aluigi.altervista.org/quickbms.htm) tool.

I just exported it to .obj and opened it in Blender. 
Take a print screen as the model is appearing to you.

If you don't like the Administrative Privileges don't install it under the c:\Program Files (x86)\.

In your case just use the portable version.

I have released the Tree of Savior .3d loader module in the 3D Object Converter v7.032 (Windows).

I have add a new parameter to the Options/Import/Tree of Savior .3d:
Extract the .png file from the Tree of Savior .3d file after load (default=true)

The npc_gragina.3d file has 3 texture files.
The loader module extracts the .png files as npc_gragina_tex_1.png; npc_gragina_tex_2.png; npc_gragina_tex_3.png and assigns these textures to the subobjects automatically.

How to get the 3D Object Converter:
Download the 3D Object Converter from [ http://3doc.i3dconverter.com](http://3doc.i3dconverter.com) and install it or download and use the portable version.
After it just use the Help/Check for updates... function to get the v7.032.

If you have installed the program under the c:\Program Files x86 folder, you must have an administrator rights to replace files in the c:\Program Files x86 folder.

Why don't you use the portable version?

Hi all,

Could someone explain how we just recovered the link of the .3D file?
I don't know if this has changed since the 1st post, but today there is no option to download the file, just a sort of Model Viewer.
I also can't find a link by looking at the page with the devellopement option of google chrome.

Thanks in advance.

(If this is no longer possible today, does anyone know or have the possibility of recovering the 3D assets of TOS?
As it is an MMO I imagine that the game had to be patched and that it is difficult to recover the game files? I can't find much information on the web about what is possible to do on TOS today
