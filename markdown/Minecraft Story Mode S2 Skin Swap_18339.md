- Post Title: Minecraft Story Mode S2 Skin Swap

Hello everyone!
For a while now I have been trying to change the characters skin in MCSM S2 from the default to an edited texture. However noone has a tutorial on how to do it. I have been looking in RandomTBush's Telltale all in one model converter Fourm for months now but noone seems to be posting in it.
If anyone can post or DM me how to do it that would be great!
Thanks
Kaizo
