MP3 files is dialogues, music and sounds compressed.

Header - VSSF, 8 bytes, 56 53 53 46 01 00 10 00.
Could be heard with several settings (11025, Mono, 16-bit; ADPCM, 44100, Mono), but some noises will be.

Samples - [https://dropmefiles.com/0uZoY](https://dropmefiles.com/0uZoY)

Interesting in a way to convert or decode these files.
