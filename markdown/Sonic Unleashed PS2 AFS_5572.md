- Post Title: Sonic Unleashed PS2 AFS

This doesn't seem to be a start AFS format.

AFS Explorer can open it, but the files list all have "pro" the AFS itself is 1gb big, so year, don't think I can upload it. I think it's  AFSv2 type. PSsound extract it as well, but some the audio is fast or too slow. Anyway, I'm wonder if anyone knows if there's a unpacker for this.

I haven't tried it myself with that game, but hcs's lafs v0.3 works great on AFS files for me.  Grab it from [hcs64.com's Stream Ripping Tools page](http://www.hcs64.com/files/lafs03.zip).  According to the [Online DB for VGM Streams](http://www.hcs64.com/manakoAT/vgm_db/roms.php?system=21&set=2501), the game uses both ADX and AIX files for music.  Good Luck.
