- Post Title: FEIST - import font file to assets

Hi! I need help for this problem.

I want import TTF file in assets. I used many tool but I can't. Game always crashed. (maybe problem is font file, i don't know)

I import before language file and work but if I import modified font file game is crashed.
(import again original font file no problem too)

Here is the tools I used:

UAE_0_3(BETA_3)
UnityAssetsExplorer 1.4_HAOOSE.zip-27-v1-4

I found a lot of code on the site, but I can't use.

Here is the original/modified fonts and original assets file.

Original font is TrueType, and your modified is OpenType. That's maybe the reason of crashing.

^^There is 8 original font in sharedassets0.assets and I used other original fonts (instead of High Fiber) but crashed again.

BTW original .assets size 35.505KB and modified .assets size 35.553KB.

Original High Fiber size 47KB
Modified High Fiber size 49KB

I think it doesn't delete the old file. Maybe that is the problem.

How else can I import?

Thanks

You can import it with [UnityEX](http://www.zoneofgames.ru/forum/index.php?showtopic=36240).
