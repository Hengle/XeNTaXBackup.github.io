Used this quickbms script for audio and it worked perfect. Now just need the sprite data.

[Here's](https://gist.github.com/barncastle/be026bbbab5c469f4e9e1317e95276e9#file-soundsettings-cs-L17) the structure of SoundsSettings.zpbn, the only real benefit of parsing it is for filenames. Just a note to anyone not using C#, [BinaryReader.ReadString](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.io.binaryreader.readstring?view=net-6.0) uses a 7BitEncodedInt length prefix.

Textures are already documented on this [post](https://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=23434). In short; ZLib decompress all the zxnb files and run them through your preferred [XNB converter](http://wiki.xentax.com/index.php/XNA_Game_Studio_4.0_XNB#Compatible_Programs).

Also FYI this game uses a 48kHz sample rate opposed to the usual 44.1kHz - which is also what the script uses.
