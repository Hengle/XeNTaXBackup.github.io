- Post Title: Superstar: compression of files in SDF archives

Hi all, 

I was wondering what type of compression is used on these two examples of files I could extract from some game called Superstar (see request : [viewtopic.php?f=10&t=3305](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=3305) ).

That is great progress.
can you post a .nif file so I could compare it to a normal one and I might be able to get some clues.
I can try to rip these files from memory while the game is running if that will help.
