- Post Title: Final Fantasy XIII text files

I have the 57 GB version of FFXIII for Steam, and I'm not sure if it has the Japanese script files, 
but I don't even know where to look.

Can someone please help me extract anything that has Japanese strings?? Or does anyone already have those??
Just the dialogues is fine.
