- Post Title: Glacier engine TEX tool

Hello. I know there is a TEX tool already for Glacier engine games, but it only support up to Hitman: Blood Money. So i want to open, edit and modify Kane & Lynch TEX files, because the cutscenes are in textures, and i would like to translate them. Is there any newer tool or somebody could help upgrade the current tool for support K&L games too?

Same tool, same version which i talked about. It can extract the files, but the result is nothing just a mess, can't work with those files  This is why asked for a newer version.

Is there anybody who could help me and create a tool for import/export these .TEX files? As i said, the already available Glacier TEX Tool is only compatible with Hitman 3 and older Hitman games, it is not usable for K&L .TEX files
