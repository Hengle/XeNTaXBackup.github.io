I'm trying to get some files from an archived *.dat game file. The game's name is Edgar Torronteras Extreme Biker (also known as Moto-X 2000). It's a motocross racing game which came out about 18 years ago.

So far, I've had success in extracting graphical (bitmap) and audio data from a different .dat file using Dragon Unpacker within the game, but strangely, I can't get the complete resources from this other *.dat file using any archive ripping program including Dragon Unpacker. I've tried all sorts of archive extraction programs.

I know the archive contains the files with their appropriate extensions and types in the archive. Also, if I open the file using notepad, it tells me some of the file names. What I need are the race-track files (extension of *.wld) and the custom objects/meshes which were created by an old version of 3d Studio Max R2 (with a *.jm5 extension).

Back in the early 2000's, there were tons of websites that supported this game. Sadly they're now all gone (except for a few traces visible with wayback machine). It's one of my favorite games and I want to make custom tracks, but I need the object files like the stadium and the haybales. I know that .dat archive has it all. If I can just find a way to open the box and get my hands on them.

The file size is about 240MB. If anybody's willing to help out, the download links are below:
