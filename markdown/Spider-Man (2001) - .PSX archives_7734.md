- Post Title: Spider-Man (2001) - .PSX archives

Could someone please look into extracting the contents of the .PSX archives from Spider-Man?

The archives are found within *\data.pkr, an archive which is already extractable with Watto Studios' Game Extractor. Most of these archives are further contained within .kat files for each level, but some are not.
I have checked two archives from the source:
*\data.pkr\carnage.PSX (presumably Carnage)
*\data.pkr\superock.PSX (presumably Monster-Ock)
I own a copy of this game. My E-mail address is accessible from my profile on this forum.

There are also reference files included with the archives, which when opened in Notepad show information about those archives.

Thanks,
Friedslick6
