- Post Title: Mortal Kombat Armageddon PS2 KAF Modding

Hi, I wanted to know if there is any way to Hack Mortal Kombat Armageddon, with whatever means, in order to be able to do this:

1.Put fighting moves in KAF that are not originally in KAF
2.Put weapons in KAF that are not originally in KAF
3.Put Special Power moves in KAF that are not originally in KAF


KAF means Kreate A Fighter
