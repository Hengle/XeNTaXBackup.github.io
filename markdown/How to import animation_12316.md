- Post Title: How to import animation

Hello everyone. 

Because I'm japanese and not a good English, I'm sorry to be difficult to read. 

Please tell me how to import animation file exported by noesis. I extracted model files from Fate unlimited code Portable. But, this gmo file cannot animate. I think that mot file is animation file. But, this file cannot import by using maya and other 3D tools like lightWave.

Please tell me if it is can be seen something.

Thank you
