- Post Title: Corpse PArty Book of Shadow .FNT/FNI files

Hello everyone, I'm trying to translate Corpse Party Books of Shadow (in french), so I created a tool (that seems good) to extract text and reinsert them into the game, but I would have to reinsert the special chraracters, or I have found no way to change it.
Can you help me?
Thank you in advance.

Here are the files in question ( .fnt / .fni files and a. Bin file)
