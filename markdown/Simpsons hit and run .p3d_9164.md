- Post Title: Simpsons hit and run .p3d

Anyone found how to extract the models from this game? The .p3d files won't open in zmodeler and neither in 3dsimed. If you know how to please post here 

Also, how you can edit the .rcf files in the main folder?

Take a look at this BMS script: [viewtopic.php?p=72978#p72978](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?p=72978#p72978)
p3d files are normally audio files, VGMstream should open that.
