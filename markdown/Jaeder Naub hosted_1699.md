The mainsite for my tool is now at the given adress by Mr.Mouse which
makes it much easier for me to let the tool reach out for people.
however , the old site [http://jaedernaub.ath.cx](http://jaedernaub.ath.cx)
is up sometimes (but not always ofcourse), it may contain additional releases, or extra information which i didnt have time to send to Mr.Mouse
for some reasons.

Yeah, and soon you will find the new version at our pages. @Strobe: I had to do a complete reinstall of my OS this week, so I dodn't have time to upload the new version. But will do! I'm just glad i could install my coding stuff again and can now work some more on MexCom.
