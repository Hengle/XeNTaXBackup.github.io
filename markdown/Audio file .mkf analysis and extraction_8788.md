- Post Title: Audio file .mkf analysis and extraction

:::[ Who am I? ]
Hello dear XeNTaX Community! I presented myself already in this topic: ([viewtopic.php?f=10&t=6500](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=6500)). And thx to many people I got successfull in my translation patch, which became a beloved file for many gamers.

:::[ What's up this time? ]
Well, this time it seems a little bit more complicated. I try to not annoy anyone and give just the most important information for understanding (if requested I can give of course more). The situation is that there is a file (.mkf) which is in a proprietary format... so there are no specifications around. The .mkf files basically contains an .mp3 file and text.

:::[ What is the aim of this thread? ]
The aim is to "discover" (or better analyse) the .mkf file, in order to extract the .mp3 and possibly text it actually contains. Sounds easy hu?

:::[ Examples and info? ]
This link <link removed due forum rules violation> contains the following files:

```
4.284.125 Rammstein - Engel.mp3
4.281.860 Rammstein - Engel.MKFv1.5.mkf
4.281.860 Rammstein - Engel.MKFv1.2.mkf
```

The .mid file contains the audio specifications + lyrics of a song.
The .mp3 file contains only the converted audio stream without lyrics.
The first .mkf is version 1.5 of itself and the second is version 1.2 of this proprietary "encoded/encrypted" file.
Both .mkf files contains the .mp3 + lyrics.

:::[ Conclusion! ]
I really would appreciate a lot your help into recovering this problem. As usual really many people would be grateful and myself would simply gain more knowledge of this wonderful world. Please, all your help is much, much appreciated.

Warmest and best Regards to you all
Sincerely
KLseeker
