- Post Title: What should I check first if I want solve this path pattern?

Please excuse me for raising such a vague question.

Examples:
http://(some site)/resource/production/Android/Assets/AssetBundle/object/resource/0092/0092000005/6c83a6e2c27f9dd1819fb7c319ff51e6e4a4d67d

Problem:
There are hundreds of game images stored in these files.
They could be extracted with UnityEX.

The final part (e.g. 6c83a6e2c27f9dd1819fb7c319ff51e6e4a4d67d) is the thing I want.
I think it either follows some pattern, is some type of hash, or stored at some other master files.

I do not expect a full solution, please suggest some steps that I can try, so that maybe one day I can solve this.

Things I have tried so far:
- monitor network traffic at game start and loading of desired resources (e.g. image)
   > some text files with unknown encryption/encoding (... GlL65H/R1remLVp3eu7qCmiuYNTCaUOzPsR44Qo//U+GvFb2nL/ ...)
- open some files under /Android/data/(folder of this game)
   > most text files also stored in the way mentioned above
