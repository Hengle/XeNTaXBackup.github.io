Hi!   

Could someone please modify this noesis plugin to make it compatible with this version of models

[http://oasis.xentax.com/files/plug/alie ... 010_v2.zip](http://oasis.xentax.com/files/plug/aliensvspredator2010_v2.zip)

the engine is the same of alien vs predator 2010 from rebellion studios.
Here are some examples:

thanks

You can export but there's very limited edit functionality (I think rotate bones and hide mesh or something). Basically none. It's a viewer.

Just use a proper 3D editor for that.

Yeah, I'd so like to get Hitler from SEV2 for my Downfall parodies.

don't have my AvP resource connected right now to compare the formats.  Already have the changes necessary for the mesh format, just have to check if there is some way to tell them apart and fix the HSKN/HSKL reading.

I would really like to see this happen, I used the new Asura Quickbms script to get the models but doesn't seem to work in noesis.

Can you release an updated version of the script, people that needs AVP will download the AVP one then if you need sniper elite V2 you can overwrite it with the new plugin.

Do not have this game, or enough samples to ensure it works in all cases, so it may not be perfect.  Does not grab the joint names currently.

Hope its good enough for now.

I'm having a problem. The new dll is not allowing me to see the rscf files any longer in Noesis. Even my AvP files are gone. I reinstalled the original AvP plugin and the rscf files were back, but, of course, it didn't work for the sniper elite files. I then tried updating Noesis and using the new plugin but the problem remained.

Any advice would be much appreciated.

The textures in full resolution are in the file TheBlob.PC_textures(rename to TheBlob.PC) , use the asura.bms script for extract or use AsuraEngineExtractor.exe 
[http://www.terrybutler.co.uk/tools/asur ... extractor/](http://www.terrybutler.co.uk/tools/asura-engine-extractor/)

for the models. load first the .HSKL file in noesis then add the .HSKN and ends with the RSCF.

I figured out the texture problem shortly after I posted. I'm still getting the rscf problem though. With the new plugin, rscf files for AvP and Sniper Elite no longer appear as a known file format as they did before.

EDIT: *snipped old issues*

Everything is working great with the newly uploaded plugin. Thanks a million revelation. I really, really appreciate it

This is really nice! Thanks Revelation! Also if you add bones names and other things it would be nice if you could add them on the Noesis Website like the other AVP plugin.

Wonder if we can put them back to the game. Any more and we might end up making Fegelein the sniper instead of Karl.

I recently discovered that Rogue Warrior runs on the asura engine and that the bms script unpacks everything perfectly. However, the current noesis plugin doesn't support the models. Can I request that support be added for these models? No rush, I'm patient   

Here is a sample: [http://www.mediafire.com/?qad36au2p3e3rdo](http://www.mediafire.com/?qad36au2p3e3rdo)

Thanks!
