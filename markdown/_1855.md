Hello!

I'm sure we could help you if you could do a few things for us...
1. Calm down, please. No offense to you, but shouting for help won't help us any.
2. Can you provide the file you're trying to extract music from? We can't help much without the file to look at...

Lastly, you posted this in the wrong forum, you should have posted it in the Audio Formats forum further down...

YOU DON'T HAVE TO TYPE IN ALL CAPS to yell in a post. Often, it will have a certain mood to it, and the fact that the thread title was all caps didn't help the mood of his post much.

How about searching this forum for sb0 first before asking the question?
