- Post Title: Darkstar One .aim .screen .anim files (editing, decompiling or extracting)

Darkstar One from German game studio Ascaron contains some file that are mysterious...

In an folder called "scripts" it has .anim files with names that suggest they are actually images, not scripts or animations...
In that same folder there are .screen files that i likewise suspect to be images, but cannot convert to anything viewable or editable...
Then there is the proprietary audio file format .aim that I cannot seem to convert into something editable...

I've attached a zip with an example of each type of file.

Could anyone take a look and see if there's something that can be done to edit these files?
