I've checked it myself and files currently can't be played in foobar with vgmstream plugin or converted with fmod bank tools.

They may be encrypted or just not supported yet by those programs.
You can try to post a feature request on vgmstream's github page [https://github.com/vgmstream/vgmstream/issues](https://github.com/vgmstream/vgmstream/issues)
