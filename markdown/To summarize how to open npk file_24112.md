- Post Title: To summarize how to open npk file?

(It's my first time and I don't english well.. please understand if I mistake!)

I wanted to extract npk file in netease game.
(for 3d model, texture, bone..~~)

so i try  quickbms + nxpk.bms  -->  but every file is .dat

retry npkUnpacker   -->   ktx, junk, mesh is out.       (under this page - [viewtopic.php?p=154556](https://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?p=154556))
but can't open it with PVRTexTool..

but CyberConv was mentioned a lot(?)  so I tried        ([viewtopic.php?p=154556](https://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?p=154556))
put the mesh file  -->  3d model is out but rigging is wrong..

 


o no.

I've been very confused on the way here..
Is there any other way?     (or is blocked?)

(the file I want to extract)
