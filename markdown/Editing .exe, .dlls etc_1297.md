Hi does anyone how I could edit a .exe file, or .dll file. I've tried using a dissassembler but it just gives me a load of rubbish.

Thanks!

Well, a disassembler is certainly the first thing that comes to mind.

What kind of edit do you wish to perform?

I've tried editing the game using the .cod files, but it seems there is only so much you can do that way.

I really want to get into the heart of the game because I host servers and I'm trying to spice up the game.

There seems to be so many more things to change, so it must be in a .exe or.dll

Hacking exe files is serious business and takes a lot of knowledge and experience. Getting to the heart of a compiled chunk of machine code, even with tools, may take months or years. Are you sure you know the magnitude of what you're trying to accomplish?

Unless you get really really lucky and the exe turns out to be decompilable, you're stuck.

I would be willing to pay someone to do this. So if any of you hotshots think you can edit it in a way to give me results, then I will give you money.

The more exciting things you can do, the more you get paid. It's a simple as that.

I may know how hard it is but I promise you I'm not the right man for the job. If I were, you wouldn't have enough money to pay me.

The main question is "what are you hoping to accomplish?", just to do it? good luck.

there are many things you can do with an exe, are you just trying to change a windows exe's resource? use a resource editor

is it a game, have you looked to see if the game has a scripting engine? that would be easier for changing aspects of the game, by editing the scripts (usually in another file).

i've been debugging exe's for years, on the assembly level. in fact, Mr Mouse has been sending me exes that i've been looking at the assembly, so i can simulate things he needs (VB).

Yes I'm trying to edit a game. I'm trying to change things in the actual game. Things that are impossible to do with editing the .COD file. 

I assume it could be in the .exe file but it could be in the .dll files as well.

Maybe I should send it to one of you guys? And you can see what you can do. Then if you can do something, I'll pay you to do it.

I'm not after major changes, but basic alterations. Parameter changes, mostly likely just changes values, or changing 'Trues' to 'Falses'

It shouldnt be complicated.

Well I'm not sure what exactly is possible. It just seems some changes can only be made in the .exe, or .dll

Its just simple things like different default values and things like that. Just a change of a value from say 10 to 12.

If you can help me, I'll pay you. It shouldnt be too complicated

Tampering with EXE files can be a legal problem as well. If your dead set on trying then perhaps you can find your value with a HEX editor.
