- Post Title: Payday 2 Bundle files unpacker

Hey guys, just thought i would post about this, i found it the other day...

How to unpack the Payday 2 .bundle files.
Some nice guys over at JPmodfiles created a tool to open payday 1 files a while back and updated it to work for payday2 as well. You can both unpack and repack files, so it could lead to some fun modding potential.

Dead easy to use,  put the tool anywhere you like, run it go to the settings tab and set the payday 2 game folder ( if steam installed, then it will be /steamapps/common/Payday 2) 
Also set where you want to unpack the files ( it can be anywhere) Each "bundle" unpacks to its own separate folder...
On the unpack tab you can either choose to Unpack all files ( took a while to unpack nearly 20gb of data ) or you can choose to unpack just a single "bundle", which are found in your /Payday 2/assets/ folder. 
When extracting a single bundle, you may notice there are 2 files with nearly identical names, you need to choose the " _h " file to unpack the other file.
For example, you want to unpack 0a76b707eba65bc7.bundle (which is 64mb in size) So you will need to select 0a76b707eba65bc7_h.bundle (which is only 4kb)

Anyway.. Heres the file... [LINK](http://www.mediafire.com/download/82er22y5e3y5azc/payday_tool_v2.zip)
And thanks again to the guys at jpmodfiles.


Incidentally, i have a thread in the 3d models section regarding payday 2 models, located [HERE](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=10839) 
I have supplied a few examples of game models (ive already figured out the textures, they just needed renaming to DDS, yes really that simple lol)
Some kind soul has already taken a look at the model format.. He said its relatively easy to convert one, something to do with a float?? and he gave some numbers. 
I had no clue, so he pointed me to a tutorial chrrox wrote, but again that was way over my head ( it just doesnt sink in ) 
So im really hoping someone with a little spare time, could take a look at the thread and the info the other guy has written and see if there is anyway to streamline/ simplify/ automate the process. 
Ideally something like a very simple file converter or a max script or something like that, would be perfect for me    Just a simple file i can use, rather than having to go in with hex editors and things i dont understand.
Anyway, the info is there and apparently its fairly easy to convert a file, so if anyone is interested in helping me/us out please have a look at the thread and see if you can do anything.

Thanks in advance.. Nobby
PS the reason i want access to the models so bad is, i have access to a tabletop sized multi axis miller and possibly access to a 3d printer. Id love to have a go at making a mould for some of the masks and take resin casts of them...
