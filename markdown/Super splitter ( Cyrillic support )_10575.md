- Post Title: Super splitter ( Cyrillic support )

Hi guys i'm opened data.pak with winrar and edited Strings_en.XML from Super splitter game ( added some Cyrillic alphabet ).

But when i start a game it crashes! it didn't support Cyrillic so i have question from u guys ! is there anyway to add cyrillic symbols in the pak file?
