- Post Title: PLEASE HELP! opening Catherine .nif

Hey everybody, I'm having a big problem trying to open a .nif file in Blender. My goal is convert it to .OBJ to open in maya as the mesh is all I care about but when I import the the file all I can see are bones! I'm stuck and was wondering if someone could help a super ultra noob. Thanks so much in advance!

I'm using: 
Blender 2.49b
Python 2.6.4
pyFFI 2.1.4
NIF SCRIPT 2.5
