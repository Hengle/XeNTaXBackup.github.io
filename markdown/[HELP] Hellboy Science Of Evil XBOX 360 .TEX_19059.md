I was hoping someon could update Acewell's NOESIS texture plugin( [LOCATED HERE](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=14903) ) too include XBOX 360 .TEX support. I just came across this thread, and hoped it would work for 360 as well. The models show up in Noesis properly, but the textures don't. I've uploaded all 360 player textures too: [https://drive.google.com/open?id=1QZn9p ... Sj52sO-j6J](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1QZn9pSXlXPaWkMUo0ivrybSj52sO-j6J) as well as the original Noesis plugin( 1_tex_HellboyScienceofEvil_PS3_tex ). Thanks in advance to Acewell, for both these awesome plugins( model / textures ) and thanks in advance to anyone who can quickly update it. 

Regards, Ecelon;

It is similar problem where I am also stuck but many times it happened that there may be a problem in the hardware part.
