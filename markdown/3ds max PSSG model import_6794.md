This is a beta version of my pssg import script.
it will convert textures to dds , and import a model as an obj.
It may not work on every game yet but i know the problem and will fix it when i get some time.

Thank you very much chrrox.
Ar Tonelico is one of the games that don't work yet? I tried it and I get a runtime error "vertex index in face out of range: [1,2,3]" on Max2010 x64.

Edit: Neptune are importing fine. Atelier Rorona, some models import but the UV is messed.

Thank you again.

chrrox any chance you're gonna make quickbms script for shadow heart 2 covenant too,because i already used your script for shadow heart and it doesn't work but still shadow heart 2 covenant use the pack file too

Thanks a lot bro

I hope if you have time you will create it

Thanks a lot chrrox

I just discover this website, but Chrrox can you told me the name of the game where this model is extract???
And if we can found this model for 3dsmax and eventually the texture too ^^


It's very amazing, but I don't understand how to extract like you do :/

The character is "Noir", from the PS3 game, Hyperdimension Neptunia (Chou Jiggen Game Neptune).

Ok ^^
Thanks AntaresZwei, I buy the game when I was in Japan (the cover is sexiest ^^) but I haven't seen this girl yet...

I'm looking for some 3ds models of characters from games like this one, and like Idolmaster etc etc but I don't find any of them :/


(ps: Noir means Black in French, I don't know if their is a link, but...   )


Edit: and chrrox, I'm sure their is many of tutorials to extract from the game, but I have juste to find a computer witch can read Bluray to read my Japanese game, and use your script in max 2011 x64 to get the models and texture from the game?

(or it's very more complicated? ^^"")

If you have the "original game", the files have to be extracted from the PS3 ISO using a hacked PS3, the script works better in the previous versions of 3DMax. 

I hope to help you at least a little bit.

I'm curious, does anyone have an updated version of the script that also supports MTG: Tactics PSSG files. Sadly the one here doesn't do it.
It seems the PSSG files though are analogous though. Seems to contain textures will most likely be very similar to the ones in other games.

Did the test on 3dsmax 9 with the newest version of the script found here. The result is 

```
-- Type error: Call needs function or class, got: undefined

```

Also this line gets highlited

```
writestring s (toUpper TEXTURE_array[3])
```

Quick model example

Sorry to bump an old topic,

But I'm currently trying to use this script, and I've tried it using Max 9, and Max 2010 - I assume that this is something for a specific version of 3DS Max?
I get the same results in an error box as previously posted.

Any help would be much obliged!

Every game that uses PSSG uses some new/different nodes. Usually when a new PS3 SDK comes out, an updated version of PhyrEngine comes out too so it's just too much work and there are too many games to try and support them all. You can also try my Totori/Meruru PSSG OBJ export... but dunno if that will work. I don't have your game.

EDIT: Oh, ha ha ha just saw it was free to play. If it wasn't free I wouldn't look at it... but since it is free... come back in a few days I'll see what I can do.

Even if there are new structs or change existing structs, can the format be parsed so that you treat each struct separately?
Much like the gamebryo format with their 50+ versions and variations.

I would like to see samples for different games as well. Maybe put together a pssg model archive from different games. Getting PS3 samples is too expensive for me lol

Magic the gathering tactics is free on steam and contains a ton of pssg files. Mtgt has same nodes as totori and meruru plus 2 or 3 additional nodes. Everything else is same.

oh ok, I think I can send you some sample files if you want them. i'll send you my pssg.cpp source if you don't mind looking at C++ . be nice to see if somebody can extract the models from Journey, which also uses PhyreEngine.

Ripper for magic the gathering tactics. Currently incomplete. Sorry don't have time to work on it.
Has model and UV. Texture extraction works but for some reason something is wrong with it; they are dark and they only open in Ifranview. Somebody told me something was wrong with diffuse component. Even Microsoft Texture Explorer doesn't load them; not sure why. Some models have points all over the place; those are morph maps I think, which I save but don't load faces for. Levels don't look right for same reason as totori and meruru; there are transform nodes I don't traverse. Really, PSSG is a pain in the ass format as you really have to load the entire tree and traverse it to get everything right.

Instructions:
Extract all .PSSG.gz files into their own folders.
Place ripper in root directory.
Run.

- Post Title: Re: 3ds max PSSG model import

Source code for finale. Look at pssg.h and pssg.cpp.

File format is as follows:

First part of file is node descriptors. Contains name of nodes and associates each node with a unique ID. For example, node 0 is the root node, PSSGDATABASE. Also associated with each node is a bunch of properties like so. Each property (i.e. width, height, etc.) is also associated with an id.

```
// CHILD CHUNKS: YES
struct TEXTURE : public TREENODE {
 uint32 width;
 uint32 height;
 std::string texelFormat;
 uint32 transient;
 uint32 wrapS;
 uint32 wrapT;
 uint32 wrapR;
 uint32 minFilter;
 uint32 magFilter;
 uint32 automipmap;
 uint32 numberMipMapLevels;
 uint32 gammaRemapR;
 uint32 gammaRemapG;
 uint32 gammaRemapB;
 uint32 gammaRemapA;
 uint32 lodBias;
 uint32 resolveMSAA;
 uint32 imageBlockCount;
 uint32 allocationStrategy;
 std::string filename;
};

```


Some nodes have children, some do not. Look at pssg.h to find out.

Second part of file is just a list of nodes and data, each node starting with it's ID.
After ID is chunksize of data. Use this to skip nodes if you like.
After that is the number of bytes in the property table. For example, even though TEXTURE has 20 properties or so, a node may only use 10 of them.
After that is the property table.
After that is a list of children or a bunch of data; it depends on the node type.

The following code for PSSGDATABASE should explain what is what per node.

```
{
 using namespace std;
 if(debug) dfile << endl;
 if(debug) dfile << "--------------" << endl;
 if(debug) dfile << " PSSGDATABASE " << endl;
 if(debug) dfile << "--------------" << endl;
 if(debug) dfile << "offset = " << position << endl;

 // set stream position
 binary_stream stream(bs);
 stream.seek(position);

 // create node
 boost::shared_ptr<TREENODE> node(new PSSGDATABASE);
 typedef map<uint32, boost::shared_ptr<TREENODE>>::value_type value_type;
 tree.insert(value_type(position, node));

 // set parent
 uint32 parent = 0;
 map<uint32, uint32>::iterator iter = parent_list.find(position);
 if(iter != parent_list.end()) parent = iter->second;
 if(debug) dfile << "parent = " << parent << endl;
 node->parent = parent;

 // read chunk properties
 PSSGDATABASE* info = static_cast<PSSGDATABASE*>(node.get());
 info->chunktype = stream.BE_read_uint32(); if(stream.fail()) return error("Read failed.");
 info->chunksize = stream.BE_read_uint32(); if(stream.fail()) return error("Read failed.");
 info->propbytes = stream.BE_read_uint32(); if(stream.fail()) return error("Read failed.");
 if(debug) dfile << "chunktype = " << info->chunktype << endl;
 if(debug) dfile << "chunksize = " << info->chunksize << endl;
 if(debug) dfile << "propbytes = " << info->propbytes << endl;

 // validate
 if(info->propbytes > 1000) return error("Unexpected number of property table bytes.");
 if(info->propbytes == 0) return error("Property table expected.");

 // read properties
 uint32 bytes_read = 0;
 while(bytes_read < info->propbytes)
      {
       // read index
       uint32 type = stream.BE_read_uint32();
       if(stream.fail()) return error("Read failed.");
       bytes_read += 4;
      
       // data bytes
       uint32 size = stream.BE_read_uint32();
       if(stream.fail()) return error("Read failed.");
       bytes_read += 4;
       bytes_read += size;
      
       // find index
       typedef map<uint32, PSSGATTRIBUTE>::iterator iterator;
       iterator iter = attrlist.find(type);
       if(iter == attrlist.end()) {
          stringstream ss;
          ss << "Failed to find property for index " << type << "." << ends;
          return error(ss.str().c_str());
         }
      
       // read attributes
       const string& parameter = iter->second.parameter;
       const string& attribute = iter->second.attribute;

This is some great stuff here. Currently I have an app that opens pssg files completely but only supports exporting/importing textures and cubemaps.  You can find it here: [http://petar.outer-heaven.net/downloads/](http://petar.outer-heaven.net/downloads/)

I'd love to extend it to work with models, but the problem is that I have zero knowledge of models and the terminology.  If anyone has anything that can possibly teach how models "work" I'd be happy to learn.

Hi everyone 
I am try to open the PSSG model files from Supremacy MMA game on Xbox360 (need help please).

So far, the PSSG3.ms only extract the texture files (.DDS files), no model has import to the scene. 
So, after the script is finish running, I got the textures and the empty scene.

I also try the ripper.exe that posted here, it happen to extract the texture files as well as the model file into .lwo file.
Then I open the model with LightWave and export it into 3ds max. But now the problem is that the model dosen't or missing the UV map.
And when I look back at LightWave, there are no UV on the model as well.

Thanks:   ฝากรูป
I then try another ripper.exe from other post (like the one for [PS3] One Piece Kaizoku Musou post) but they did not do anything (no textures or model are extracted), not like the version that posted here. 

So I wonder if Chrrox or Howfie can update your tool to work with this game please!!!   
This is the file I am using for the model: [http://www.mediafire.com/?xi81g7e2b383kt3](http://www.mediafire.com/?xi81g7e2b383kt3)
Thank you for your help.

Yeah, my ripper only works on Atelier Totori and Atelier Meruru, and in another thread it also works somewhat on Magic the Gathering: Tactics as well. You can try that one too. Every PSSG game that comes out they change stuff. You should post a formal request here with some in-game pics (preferably females from the game) to help motivate those that visit here. When I think MMA I think buff chicks, so it's not that interesting to me. I was planning on working on the latest DiRT game but even the most hardcore DiRT fans say the new game sucks donkey balls big time.

BTW, every ripper.exe I release is different and is only meant to work on that specific game. That is why the one from One Piece won't work.

Also, if there is no UV data, my ripper should throw an error for any PSSG. PM me the resulting LightWave file and I will take a look at it.

> oh ok, I think I can send you some sample files if you want them. i'll send you my pssg.cpp source if you don't mind looking at C++ . be nice to see if somebody can extract the models from Journey, which also uses PhyreEngine.

Would also like to see Journey's PSSGs opened, and the models extracted. I can provide sample PSSGs taken from the trial version of the game.

> Sorry to bump an old topic,

But I'm currently trying to use this script, and I've tried it using Max 9, and Max 2010 - I assume that this is something for a specific version of 3DS Max?
I get the same results in an error box as previously posted.

Any help would be much obliged!

I used 3dsmax9 and it worked, put the *.ms file into the C:\Program Files\****\Scripts\Startup\ directory and boot the 3dsmax, it will ask for .pssg at startup. If you are using different versions, try put the .ms into any directory possible in the 3dsmax folder, it will worked out as the directory match.
