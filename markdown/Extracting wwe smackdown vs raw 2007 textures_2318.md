yes its possible of course.
But we dont know how YET because we havnt looked into it yet.
Of course if you upload a file from the game that you believe to hold the textures then we will take a look into it for you.

We will look inside the file to see whats inside it and then try and extract it as best we can.

But PS2 games are MORE THEN OFTEN encrypted, though we can decypt it seomtimes, the ammount of time differs greatly depending on the moethod of encryption and how hard it is to reverse engineer.

Still just upload a file somewhere or even use a fiel cutter to cut up the file and post it here.
If you decided to upload it then please try and keep the uploaded file size small as we dont all want to be downloading a 1GIG file jsut to find out its an audio file or seomthing like that.

Cool.
Well you seem to have it norrowed down a fair bit this time lol.
So yeah just upload parts of them .pac files, Who knows they may already be supported if there the same .pac types as in the other WWE.

Ok, updateing. I checked it out. College again and this time I am really hurting... -_- but I will say the archives are DPACs based on the header and I saw some TIM2 files. TIM2 is a standard for PS2 like TIM is a standard for PSX.

I do not know yet if this is textures or if it is just menu stuff but I'll see.

CH.PAC files are wrestlers...
and all files in CAB are for create a belt.. 

it's been the same since HCTP...

the only game so far to be able to edit wrestlers textures was SVR..

I hope u manage to do this as I was one of the guy who modded SVR..

I remember that. It is unfortunate that in some games you can only replace somthing to add somthing in. I'm not sure SVR's methods were exactly figured out. Hmmmmm... HOWEVER. Modding SVR2007 seems unlikely since it is a console game and well... console games of this type aren't known to be moddable other than extracting things. Otherwise it requires modification of the PS2 which is apparently illegal (for rather irrational reasons), then again location protection is obsolete as perfectly legal imports are on the increase as globalization occurs more, myself included.  But at the same time it would require burning to another DVD the modded files unless some way to work around this was made.

In any which case I would see no problem, and there should be no problem, in console modding as long as it doesn't conflict with laws, which it shouldn't. At the same time there should be no problem with an American wanting to play a Japanese game as long as he or she buys it. Or even vice versa.

The problem is with console games it is harder to mod than PC games. That is all. With PC games you can extract, and in many you can add to. But with console games you can extract but to modify the game one would need a way to store the modified information and to do that, one would need to burn the game an edited stuff to another DVD/CD with the only other alternative being emulation and in these matters... it isn't that great of an option.

It is just my advice to those who don't know how to do all this that they should not bother with it. Because it will involve some money and it won't be easy.

I've always liked console modding, although xbox with the hard drive is way better than burning dvds per mod.

Anyhow, thanks for the upload. These files do not look to be encrypted but rather compressed. The image should give it away.

 I believe BPE is the answer see [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte_pair_encoding](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte_pair_encoding) 

hope to get better info soon 

:Edit: Good Guess? lol

it is still a bit off but what do you expect from just downloading a source and running it. 

used this: [http://www.csse.monash.edu.au/cluster/R ... ress/bpd.c](http://www.csse.monash.edu.au/cluster/RJK/Compress/bpd.c)
knocked 16 bytes after BPE header.

Great work, Silver.  Rumble Roses also uses this type of file.  I would love to see the models from that game!  I can't devote any time to this right now (killer college classes!) but I hope someone can develop a complete PAC extractor from this info.  I worked with these files for awhile and never could figure out the type of compression/encryption.  Kudos to you.

Laters,

Well you need to compile it and then get the files ready.

Was really a guess, the decompression is not 100%, it decompresses fine for a chunk of the file and then something is there to mess it up. I noticed in a few files it begins to mess up around even the 2nd or 3rd offset. So I don't know if they did this in chunks or what.

P.S. Good Luck with the classes

As for myself I haven't looked at it since I last posted, I am also a victim of classes. I will keep you posted though.
