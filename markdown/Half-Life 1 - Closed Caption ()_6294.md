Hello there.
I'm interested in translating games, I already translated the HL: S but, I would like to import this translation into original Half-Life.

Is there anyway to do that? I found a tutorial on the web, maybe this can work. (I couldn't do anything, because I don't know any programming language.)

Thanks in advance.

Well, I almost finished my mod.

Also, it will support the other languages.
There isn't any supported language except English now, but if you'd like to translate, mail me, and I'll post the text file when I done: [qabriel@hotmail.com.tr](mailto:qabriel@hotmail.com.tr)
