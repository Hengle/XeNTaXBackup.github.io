- Post Title: Best way of combining thousands of MP3 files?

The game Heavy Rain on PS3 uses MP3 to store voice and sfx data, and while all of it is perfectly playable, it's stored in thousands upon thousands of MP3 files which are all separate, each being 1 second long. What would be the best way of putting them all together into a single audio file I can chop up myself in Vegas?

I could just import every .mp3 into vegas or a similar audio editing program, but loading so many files at once into a program often causes it to crash, so I figure the best way would be to combine them all and cut it up myself.

> best way of putting them all together into a single audio fileUse "Free MP3 Joiner 5.1.1" from "FreeAudioVideoTec Software". Split files for parts, each part can contain 1000 mp3 files per folder. Then add them all in the tool.
