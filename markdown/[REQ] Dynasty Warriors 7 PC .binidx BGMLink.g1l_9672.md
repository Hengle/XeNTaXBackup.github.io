Hello everybody, I'm working on some mods and translations with Dynasty Warriors 7 PC Japanese version. Game's texture is stored in *.bin and audio in BGMLink.g1l. I've already have tool for editting *.bin can't do anything with game's audio. Can anyone help me unpack/repack BGMLink.g1l file. Thanks in advanced. I also found bms script for BGMLink.g1l of Warriors Orochi 3 Xbox360 version, that has the same structure, but it didn't work.
