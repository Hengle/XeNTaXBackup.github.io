Nope, this is the only one.

I tried once a different approach by renaming the kit into an AFS-file and then using AFSExplorer but it didn't worked well.

The other option for you would be getting the PoP-games for PS2 and trying to rip them via [xpert](http://xpert2.blogspot.com/2006/12/ps2-dvd5-iso-shrinker-tutorial.html).

Else, stick to the Persianrug and hope it will be maybe updated by it's creator.
