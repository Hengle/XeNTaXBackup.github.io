- Post Title: Possible .png files package: .awb files

Hi, I am trying to get some images from a chinese game, I have managed to get a hand on the decrypted .awb files, checking the files contents revealed that it contains a bunch of png file paths. I have no prior knowledge with this and I am hoping someone in this amazing community can help me decompress/extract the files.
Thank you very much.
