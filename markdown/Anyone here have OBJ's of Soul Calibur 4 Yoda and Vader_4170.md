I don't know how to do it myself. I really want to check out the topology workflow on these guys. If it's uncool to ask for something like this. Could someone please educate me on how to do it myself. I couldn't understand the SC4 thread at all, since I've never done anything like this.

Thanks

I have Xbcompress and the 360 SCIV Extractor. I Dont know how to use either of them. SCIV opens a DOS black box which closes out as soon as it appears. I also have the Yoda spd model file. 

Please someone help me. I really want this bad. I've been looking for a way to get the yoda model from this game for ages. I search for it every so often and that's what brought me here. You guys figured it out.

Step 1. First use xbdecompress on the .spd files from a cmd line. (you will see it works because the file size increases).
step 2. Then use the extractor on the decompressed files. 

goto start -- run -- type cmd to open command line then type cd "name of the working directory here" to change to that directory.
then type the tool name for usage instructions.

you should end up with model and textures if you do everything properly

CMD'd in run

Did >CD to get to the folder containing Xbdecompress.

Triggered it. 

tried Xbdecompress /M R_ALL_011_360.spd

Typed in Yes

Said it couldnt do it.

But oddly enough R_ALL_011_360.spd was in my SCIV Extractor file.

Closed out CMD.

Run CMD'd in again. 

Did the "CD" till I got to the folder destination "SCIV" where I put the SPD_EX file and the new R_ALL_011_360.spd

Eventually I wind up typing this in CMD

C:\Users\Me\Desktop\SCIV>SPD_EX R_ALL_011_360.spd

and it tells me
-----------------------------

File Name  : R_ALL_011_360.spd
File Size    : 10626432 bytes.

And the comand line

"C:\Users\Me\Desktop\SCIV>" pops back up under it. So now what do I do??? 

Thanks for the help so far. Seriously

I have made a small batch to convert the files :

- copy all your .spd in a folder, COPY because they will be deleted !
- put in it your tools, found in the sc4 thread, unzip also my .bat files in it, change your regionnal setting to have "." for decimals (if it is set to "," like on my PC)
- execute the "go_batch.bat" file (and NOT the other one)

I hope this will help you

Ok, that was pretty easy, but it's not Yoda   Oh damn now what???? I own the game- I did a youtube search on ripping and wow that's just not something I can do. Modded External DVD drive, pre reading a DVD movie, ripping the top off of the DVD drive and putting the disc in.  needing that other software...

Thanks for the easy solution but I guess now I'm in different water. No yoda

xbdecompress: error: file was not compressed in native form
xbdecompress: warning: failed to decompress to file R_ALL_02b_360.spd.spd
-----------------------------------
File Name : R_ALL_02b_360.spd.spd


>>>>>>>>>>>>>
I manually renamed the file extention after that happened to see if that was the cause ( I did not see two ".spd's" in the file)

It still reported the same error problem.

Try just extracting it with the extractor, I think it is already decompressed.

Just wanted to say thanks..

I only tried ripping models from SC4 yesterday and now i have all the characters, weapons and stages extracted and ready to be loaded into a 3d app. 
It was all possible because of SPD_EX and the batch script, so id like to say a big thanks to the guys that did those.. 
 " Thanks ! "

What do you mean you cant seem to open it, what is it doing or not doing? You do realise it has to be opened from a command prompt. its not an exe you can just click and it runs.

And i would recommend using orbbu's Batch files he created, it made my life a lot easier.

have the EXE and the batch files in the same folder, then copy any spd files you wanna convert into that folder too.
Then call up a command prompt, navigate to the folder you have the exe and batch files in . then type " go_batch.bat " without the " marks. this will extract any of the files you copied then delete them after it is finished leaving just the extracted files. i know this works coz its what i did a few days ago and now i have all the models ripped.

Good luck.
