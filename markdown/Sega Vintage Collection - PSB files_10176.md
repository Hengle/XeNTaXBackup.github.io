- Post Title: Sega Vintage Collection - PSB files

hey guys,

I'd need a little help there.
On the Sega vintage Collection games, I'd like to get the wallpapers that are displayed behind the emulator screen. That is because they appear in great resolution with no elements pasted over it.

Look for example there

I downloaded a game (which I already bought on Xbox360) and managed to extract the contents with wxPirs and what I got where mostly .psb and .psb.m files.
I think I can pinpoint which files are related to the artworks and musics.

But the biggest problem is to determine what kind of files are psb (not related to Photshop before you ask) and how to convert them into a more common format. From what I can tell, psb files store pictures as well as musics so it's probably a special container format.

Anyone got an idea about this? Any help would be appreciated and files examples can be provided if needed.

Found this recently but it's only related to the sound files:
