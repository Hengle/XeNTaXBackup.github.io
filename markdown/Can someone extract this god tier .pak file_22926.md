- Post Title: Can someone extract this god tier .pak file?

I tried sooo many ways, tools and softwares but no one can open this -god tier - .pak file. Whereas this file is the file of a game dated 2007 named Hard to Be A God. Since the game is a very old and small production, I could not find its own forum style sites or topics. İf someone can open this file, i'll be very thankful to him. Who will also have proven her/his software skills 

The God Tier File  : [https://dosya.co/5j6ccnnv7cn9/Locale.pak.html](https://dosya.co/5j6ccnnv7cn9/Locale.pak.html)

Game's steam page: [https://store.steampowered.com/app/3910 ... _Be_a_God/](https://store.steampowered.com/app/391030/Hard_to_Be_a_God/)
Note: The game isnt made with unreal engine 4 as far as I understand

Methods I tried:

And all programs for extract paks (like 7zip, pakextractor etc.)

Ok, your file is encrypted and you need a valid AES key, so you have 2 options here

1. Ask for key in this topic [https://cs.rin.ru/forum/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=100672](https://cs.rin.ru/forum/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=100672)
2. Use AES finder tool and look for key by yourself

When you'll find a key, you can post it here for others.

I can't find a key for "How to Be A God" game, ı asked them but I don't think they will make a tool for such a small game.

While this game is not an UE game, indeed, the main problem is that it's too old and you simply can't find any release of it around. If resources are actually encrypted, you should at least provide main game exe, so people could try to find something from it. But I'm not even sure single exe will be enough, if they still have parts of their original DRM integrated in steam release.
Anyway, it's also worth to create similar separate topic on zenhax (if you didn't do that already) with the pak and exe samples.

Update: Found actually working tool (it has been [posted](http://www.xentax.com/uploads/author/itg/BurutPAKExtractorV135.zip) on xentax before). It's universal tool for extracting many Burut games. Also, code for decryption part is available [here](http://wiki.xentax.com/index.php/SpartaPAK) (it's similar tool, also compatible with the game).

Any idea of how to repack the files after modding them?
