- Post Title: How to view encrypted RE2 mod files with noesis？

This is a mod file for RE2, and I want to export it as a model in fbx format using noesis. But this file is protected by other encryption software. (Software address: [http://dataguard.bohaisoft.cn/](http://dataguard.bohaisoft.cn/)) I don't know how to decrypt it. Hope someone can help me, thanks!
