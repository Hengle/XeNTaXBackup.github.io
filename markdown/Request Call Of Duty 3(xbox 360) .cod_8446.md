- Post Title: Request Call Of Duty 3(xbox 360) .cod

I have basically no experience in how to view and extract game archives. What I have tried is Watto's Game Extractor 2 which has support for ".cod" files but when scanning any of the COD3 ".cod" files it says no files were found.

The game engine is called NGL and the developer is Treyarch. The only slight success I guess I had with it is opening it in IDA Pro giving me hex values of what looked like folder locations, which didn't really help me access any of the files themselves.(Maybe it would but I just don't know what I'm doing)

Game Extractor's support for ".cod" files comes from Call Of Duty 2: Big Red One which uses the same engine and same developer as Call of Duty 3.

Any help would be appreciated.

Since no one knows how to decompile .cod files could someone point me in the direction of a tutorial on what to look for to learn how to open an unknown archive format? I looked in the tutorial section but nothing really explains the basics of finding headers in a hex editor and stuff like that.
