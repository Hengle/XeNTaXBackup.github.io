I think you meant to type: Left Behind, so is it kinda like what they did with Serious Sam and Quake 3?

Hello, I'm new here and I've been attempting to access the LB files for some time. All of my attempts have failed from PAKscape to other means of accessing the compressed file. 

Mambox says that those files are "Pure Zip" What does that mean? 

Thanks for your time.

well i said pure zip but xored!!

you can use the excellent xor tool of aluigi

hxxp://aluigi.altervista.org/mytoolz/xor.zip

and xor x08c the files to convert it to zip format.

or maybe Mr.Mouse will make a plugin who do the work for beginner...

Ah...I was wondering what Xor was, thanks. I'll try and take it from here...

UPDATE: OK, I got the file and with 0x8c as the key:

Hex Key:

8C
read and xor file
finished.


But with the code as x08c:
78 30 38 63       x08c
Oh...and were you able to access the sound/music files?
