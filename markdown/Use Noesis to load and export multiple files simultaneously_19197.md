- Post Title: Use Noesis to load and export multiple files simultaneously?

I already know that it's possible to load multiple files into Noesis simultaneously by creating a Noesis scene file, but I can't figure out how to export multiple files simultaneously. Whenever I try to export from a Noesis scene file with multiple objects, Noesis only ever exports the first object. For example, consider the following generic template of a Noesis scene file:

```
version 1
physicslib ""
defaultAxis "0"

object {
	name "Mesh_A"
	model "Mesh_0001.dat"
	loadOptions ""
}


object {
	name "Mesh_B"
	model "Mesh_0002.dat"
	loadOptions ""
}

object {
	name "Mesh_C"
	model "Mesh_0003.dat"
	loadOptions ""
}

object {
	name "Mesh_D"
	model "Mesh_0004.dat"
	loadOptions ""
}
```


By creating a Noesis scene that follows the above format, I can load as many objects into Noesis as I want. But Noesis only ever wants to export the very first object. Is there some way around this? Like a batch export, or something?

Did you find a solution to this?

In my case I'm trying to export a model with multiple sub meshes but the export only ever contains a single model.
I found the -modelindex # paramter, which works but you can't chain multiple together, so still, only the first specified model.

Instead of Export chose Export from Preview, that will save all imported models as one.

Tried that. Didn't work.

Hey, I have the same problem.  Did you manage to find an alternative solution?
