- Post Title: GTA Trilogy - GTA3.UASSET/.UEXP

GTA Trilogy - GTA3.UASSET/.UEXP

On "Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy - The Definitive Edition" gta3.uasset and gta 3.uexp are containers that store animations (.ifp), collision data (.col), item placement data (.ipl).
With Hex Editor I'm able to extract and view the files using the modding tools for the classic games. And I managed to import back modded files into the game, as you can see here [https://i.imgur.com/vgmqAEQ.jpeg](https://i.imgur.com/vgmqAEQ.jpeg) , I managed to remove the collision from this house. But as you may know, the hex lenght should be the same as the original, so this is no good for modding.

The edition of gta3.uasset and gta 3.uexp is essential for GTA Modding and until now, no one has made a tool to extract/import the files.

I tried to make a quickbms script for it, but I faild. So I come here in hope that someone is able to make a quickbms script for the games.

Here is the file:
