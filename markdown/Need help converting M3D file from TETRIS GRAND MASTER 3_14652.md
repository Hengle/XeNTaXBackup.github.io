- Post Title: Need help converting M3D file from TETRIS GRAND MASTER 3

Hi, I'm modding Tetris Grand Master 3 game on PC. There are some M3D files inside data folder that I'd like edit in Blender.
I have not figured out how to open or convert M3D file in Blender.
I'd appreciate if anyone who have any ideas what's this file format and how to edit them?

Link to download M3D file
[http://www.filedropper.com/m3d](http://www.filedropper.com/m3d)

Thank you very much

guess this thread should be in the 3d models section   

i don't know what this is and it isn't perfect but here is the 2nd submesh of frame.m3d  



frame_m3d.png (47.94 KiB) Viewed 28 times



table for this submesh
0x4c0 - number of faces
0x4c8 - start address of faces
0x4dc - number of vertices
0x4e4 - start address of UVs
0x4f0 - start address of vertices
