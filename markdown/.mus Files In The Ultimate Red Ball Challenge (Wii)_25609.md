- Post Title: .mus Files In The Ultimate Red Ball Challenge (Wii)

Hello Everyone!

I was recently looking through the files of a Wii game called 'The Ultimate Red Ball Challenge' when I noticed that the music files are in a .mus format. I've looked high and low on google but I could not find any way of converting them to a .mp3 or other playable audio format. Just wondering if anyone knows if there is a way to convert them into a playable format, or if there is a music player that can handle .mus files. Thanks

So I have made a tiny bit of progress:

I imported the files into audacity where I found that they played, but with a lot of sound over them, would repeat several parts of the track and were pitched very highly. I could just about recognize them at 18500Hz, but the noise and the repeats still continue. 

Unfortunately, I am quite new to this sort of thing, therefore only have a very limited amount of knowledge about it, so this is all I have been able to do
