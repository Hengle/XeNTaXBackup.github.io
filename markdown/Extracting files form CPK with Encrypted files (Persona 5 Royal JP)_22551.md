- Post Title: Extracting files form CPK with Encrypted files (Persona 5 Royal JP)

I've tried every public CPK file extractor that i could find, but they dont account for file properties, so when they get to any encrypted file in the CPK, they error out and extraction fails, rendering the rest of the files in the CPK after the first encrypted file unable to extract.

Is there an extractor that can either extract the file without decrypting, or skip extracting encrypted files so that we may successfully get the rest of the files?

The game contains 3 CPK files,
- dataR.cpk (5.18GB)
- ps4_movieR.cpk (11.3GB)
- ps4R.cpk (8.67GB)

The game got an update/patch that added a smaller CPK (4mb), this CPK also contains encrypted files and thus has the same issue.

extracts less than 10 files before hitting an encrypted one and failing

You can check this one, it extracts files as they're found.

Unfortunately it doesn't seem to work even after enabling the Heroes Decrypt option.
