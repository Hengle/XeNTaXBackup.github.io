- Post Title: Lorelai Game

Hi,

I tried to translate lorelai game to my language (Arabic). The text are written in binary file so I need to edit it with hex editor. It seems that the game doesn't support Arabic letters because they don't appear in subtitles when I replaced the text. How can I add Arabic font to the game? Can anyone help?
