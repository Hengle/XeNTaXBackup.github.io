- Post Title: Digimon World Dawn/Dusk .PAK files

I've been trying for years to find something to decompress and access the image/palette files in these, with little to no real success!  I'm awaiting my download link for MultiEx and other things, but I don't know yet if it'll support them...

I have an example of one of them in here, I assume this is where the overworld sprites are:
[http://digistar.db-destiny.net/dump/MCHR_CHR.PAK](http://digistar.db-destiny.net/dump/MCHR_CHR.PAK)

I can provide links to the other ones, such as the ones that I assume have the battle sprites, mugshots and other palettes if need be.  But my hope is that this will be enough.
