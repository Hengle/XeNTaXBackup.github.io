- Post Title: Encoding .de2 (Falcom DEC RIFF) format

Hello!

I need help with the .de2 audio format. I've been translating Falcom's Gurumin to PT-br, and since I'm going as far as translating every single thing, even textures, transitions, etc. I figured I'd also translate the game's songs as well (since Falcom was kind enough to officially distribute the instrumentals to said songs). However, upon poking the game's files I came across this audio format. I know there's a way to decode it, as I've decoded the ones I have with vgmstream (using VGMGUI if I'm being a bit more specific), but I haven't found anything that can decode audio back to .de2. Is there any way to encode audio back to this format, or a way to make it so it's possible?

Any help would be greatly appreciated!
