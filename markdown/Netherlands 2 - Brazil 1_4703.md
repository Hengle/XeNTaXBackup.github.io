You know, to me the tournament has already been the greatest because of our revenge on Brazil. We kicked them home and out of the World Cup. Revenge is sweet. (1994, 1998).

That's odd, that is exactly how the world would describe the Italian team. The Netherlands don't make any more fouls than the average team. It's countries like Brazil, Italy, Portugal, Argentina and France that never seem to stop faking everything just to fix a Yellow or Red card for the opposing team, or to fix a penalty for themselves. Real actors, those teams. The way Brazil brutaly kicked Robben again and again right after the start is rediculously low behaviour. Brazil deserved to be kicked out because of that, but also because of Fabiano's hand-ball goals.
