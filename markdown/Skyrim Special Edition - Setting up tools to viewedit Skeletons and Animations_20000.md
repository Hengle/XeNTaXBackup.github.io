- Post Title: Skyrim Special Edition - Setting up tools to view/edit Skeletons and Animations

Hello, I'm hoping to get a bit of help here.

I got a bit of Skyrim Special Edition renewed interest, 

So, first thing first, I set up nifskope quite fine, but I would like to be able to view, edit and export nifs, skeletons and animations.

Which tools would you recommend I need to set up and how?

I tried installing this https://www.nexusmod...tab=description in my Student 3ds Max 2018.

It loads some models all right, and even some animations if they are baked inside the model. However, the animation appears to "decay" after a bit, and I have no idea how to fix it.

Any help is appreciated.
