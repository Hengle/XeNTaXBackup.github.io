- Post Title: Need help for 3DS Pokemon games!

Hi guys
I'm working on a MOD for pokemon. 
I found a lot of models, But there was no bones and animations.
Who can help me to export some of the pokemon game models and actions to import to 3dmax.
Such as:
3DS GAME: 
Pokémon X and Y 
Pocket Monster Omega Ruby·Alpha Sapphire
Pokémon Sun/Moon

Another way: How to export models and animations from u3d assets resources (the model is simple).
I can pay if need to.
thanks
