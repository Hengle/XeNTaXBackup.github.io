- Post Title: need help with .spr file

Hi, an old game called tibia uses .spr file to pack all the sprites together, there are tools to read and edit the .spr and the .dat file, however the custom server i am playing on has made some edits to the .spr structure making it unreadable to the available software. I would like some help with extracting the sprites from it (around 20000~ of them)

Heres the link to the .spr file  [https://mega.nz/#!vAsDUCQD!2aTyPlVxlwuQ ... cZPQjDGBNo](https://mega.nz/#!vAsDUCQD!2aTyPlVxlwuQwQcbX-1qMEYDWk76i3DaucZPQjDGBNo)
