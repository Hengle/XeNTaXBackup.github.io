I couldn't find anything that would play these files.  However, I added an Ogg Vorbis header from a working file, and just got lots of nonsense audio.

So it seems like these could be headerless Ogg Vorbis files of some sort, but without the proper header information I'm not sure if they can be decoded.

Where did you get the files?  If they're from a game, then there might be some other data that would make them playable.

I've had a look at that archive, and it's just one long .ogg file starting at offset 0x0028, after a short "XP3" header.  If you remove that short header, you can play the .ogg file - it's about 3 hours 24 minutes.

I can't see any other obvious info in the file (could be encrypted), so the game must have a lookup table somewhere that references this .XP3 file, to split it into individual sounds.

Ahh what a shame. I don't know how to do any of that, but I am very grateful for your time! At least now I know what I'm dealing with
