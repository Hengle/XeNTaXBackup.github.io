- Post Title: Extracting audio from Scooby-Doo! Case File #1: The Glowing Bug Man (The Learning Company)

Hi   , I need help extracting character dialogs or all sound files from this language version of the game (link to the MMP, MMA and MMS files): [https://icedrive.net/1/87b9ZVtUzW](https://icedrive.net/1/87b9ZVtUzW) I have tried using several programs (for example, Game Extractor from watto studios, which "supports" this game) and BMS scripts, but unfortunately none of them are compatible with this game in the series.
