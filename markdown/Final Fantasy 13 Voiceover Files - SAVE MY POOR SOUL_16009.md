I think i'm 5 hours deep into this whole mess, losing sleep big-time, and I just can't figure out where to find the voiceovers for the first FXIII game and then extract them so I can make them into a playable format. 

I managed to extract all the SOUND EFFECTS (character phrases included) easily enough from "white_imgu", but I want to be able to do things like hear Orphan's speech about slaughter and salvation without the BGM and stuff.

HeeeeeEEeeEEEeeeelp me so I can get my sanity back XD

PS3_GAME\USRDIR\white_data\sys\white_imgc\sound\pack\0350\

heartbreaking that the responses are so far and few between but while I appreciate the replies, they do not answer my question.

I have no problem extracting and converting the sound effects and phrases that characters say but I'm not sure where to locate the actual voice-over dialogues
In other words, I want to be able to hear Orphan's speech without Born Anew playing

Is this possible?
