- Post Title: Two Files which I need to edit for Fire Emblem If

Hey Guys,

I've two more files that I need to edit for Fire Emblem if for adding a Custom Chapter.
Right now, I want to add a few new entrys to FaceData.bin.lz (lz11-compressed | romfs:/face/FaceData.bin.lz) to add new NPC-Graphics to the game and I want to Edit th GameData.bin.lz (lz11-compressed | romfs:/GameData/GameData.bin.lz).

Both file types seems to be editable but I've no plans how to do that :/

I've uploaded both files.
Possibly someone could create a simple fileeditor for this files.
I guess that both files are similar.

Thank you for your help!
