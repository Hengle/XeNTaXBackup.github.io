- Post Title: [Android] Takt Op. Symphony .unity3d

Hi, i've been trying to dump files from these .unity3d files the game uses but i had no luck so far since they seem to be encrypted. I tried finding the decryption key in the il2cpp.so and global-metadata.dat files but they also seem to be either encrypted or obfuscated.

Here are some samples of the files

And here are some other files that might be of use (il2cpp.so,global-metadata.dat,assembly-csharp.patch.bytes,and this ab file with no extension that i think might be the file list)

Thanks in advance
