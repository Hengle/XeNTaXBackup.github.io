Please, do not ask for warez content, this is not the forum for that.

I'm not asking for the game, just the pak file that holds the models.

We can't extract game meshes anyway. We need to use 'RE3 Hook' tool to generate the log file but neither 'RE3Hook' nor 'RE2Hook' was able to create the log file at the moment. 

When I put the 'RE2Hook' or 'RE3Hook' in a folder and play the game, the game doesn't start. That's why I couldn't even create a log file. We need a new 'RE3Hook' tool. The tools that currently exist are for demo version.

We can't create log files with demo-version tools.
