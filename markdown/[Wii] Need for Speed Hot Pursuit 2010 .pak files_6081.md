Greets.

I used WiiScrubber to get [this](http://www.megaupload.com/?d=1L6S0PBK). It`s .pak file which I guess, has the needed 3D car models and textures (there are also .bnk files for sounds). By far, in the header it`s: 'KPXG'. Could anyone help me with a basic decompressor/extractor?

Got it extracted with 'Game Extractor', but received like, parts of that .pak file. Unfortunately, they`re just 'File 000001' without extension, as the header is the same - 'KPXG'. Help is greatly appreciated!

Thanks in advance.

Now, once we unpacked the .pak files, I have one question - how could we open .XGM model and .TWI texture formats? These are the major used extensions.

EDIT:
I had take a look into one .XGM file. It`s having 'XGSM' in the header, possible it`s the format extension? We really need this, cause imagine if Shift 2 for Wii will be using same format.

EDIT2:
LUIGI! The .XGM format seems like packed one. I`ve found textures in .tga format in it, do something possible unpacking it too!

Yeah, it does seem like that. I`ll post this in the right subforum.
