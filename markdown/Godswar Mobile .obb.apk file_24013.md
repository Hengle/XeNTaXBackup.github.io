- Post Title: Godswar Mobile .obb/.apk file

Heyo, so I'm fairly new to this. I've been able to download & extract .apk file for an android game called Godswar Mobile. I'm an artist and often draw game art. Mostly for PC games but this time I decided to draw some mobile game art. PC games are often easier to get access to and you can find their files all over the internet. Mobile games on the other hand are a bit harder at least for me since I'm not very good at this. I've been able to listen to some audio files but no luck in opening .png files located inside the .obb file. Is there a way to view them and what are the steps required?

Is there anyone that can help me with is or do this for me?

I downloaded the .apk from this site: [https://m.apkpure.com/godswar-mobile/co ... swarmobile](https://m.apkpure.com/godswar-mobile/com.igg.android.godswarmobile) 
But I assume you could get the .apk from Bluestacks 5 as well by downloading it from Play Store and then extracting it to your PC.

Most of mobile game are built with unity. So , unless are encrypted/compressed ( or aren't unity files) you could open them in AssetStudio [https://github.com/Perfare/AssetStudio/releases](https://github.com/Perfare/AssetStudio/releases) . First rename .obb in .rar and extract it, then open AssetStudio, click Load folder and select the folder in which you extracted the .obb. 
The .png could be enctrypted but the program will allow you to extract them, then post couple of samples and ppl could take a look  in case you are not able to open them.
