Hi, so the new MOBA game Jump Assemble (AKA Codename Jump) look really nice but all the assets is in .AB file format. I tried AssetBundleExtractor but ended in failure.
Just wondering if anyone could help extract it, so it would load on AssetStudio [https://github.com/RazTools/Studio](https://github.com/RazTools/Studio).

Yeah, when I asked Razmoth to support this game in Studio, I believed it's version 0.70?
Newer version must have different encryption. Will have to ask Razmoth to update it but since it's still Beta in the Philippine, I'll probably wait a bit longer until Released APK come out b4 asking or if you're in a hurry, you can ask him directly in the github page.

yeah i already did it on discord, let just wait for full release. obviously it will change every update . the encryption changed since 0.80 (may)
