I'm trying to use bundler.exe from the Xbox 360 SDK to make an .xpr so I can reinject it into the .ast using quickBMS, which requires the reinjected file be the same size as the extracted one. I think the issue is with my compression.

I exported the extracted .xpr as a .tga using Noesis, and edited it using paint.net. I've tried saving the .tga as 36 bit and 24bit, and even edited the texture in different ways, but the bundled .xpr is always the same size, which is larger than the original so it can't be reinjected.

I'm suspecting the problem is either with my .rdf for the bundler (maybe my compression is wrong) or using paint.net doesn't work or something and I should try using photoshop and edit a .dds. I've also seen posts about editing the hex to remove the header, but I've been unable to successfully do this.

If someone could double check that my compression in the .rdf is correct or if you have any suggestions for me, I'd really appreciate it!

Orginal .ast that I extracted the .xpr from:

In edited xpr created by bundler.exe data begins offset 0x80c and original xpr offset 0x60. You can simply copy header (0x60) from original xpr and paste it into edited xpr (0x80c) using hex editor.

Thank you so much for the example. That really helped me out!
