LAST UPDATE: Here

This will let you to load models and other kind of assets from Metal Gear Solid games.
Right now only works with MGS1 from PSX, but soon I'll add other games.

As my previous tools, works with Blender and is easy to install and update.


Load different files from MGS1 (PSX):
- Models (KMD, ZMD)
- Lights (LIT)
- Cutscenes (DMO)
- Collisions, cameras and flags (HZM)
- Animations (OAR)
- Extract STAGE.DIR with right structure
- Extract DEMO.DAT and VOX.DAT
- DAR works too
- PCX can be converted to TGA when loading a model.

Next update I'll add support other games.

Enjoy it!

You should mount the image and copy the files somewhere on the hard disk.

I've got it all extracted, and the stage.dir is also extracted, however I can't get the textures to work even though the dars are extracted for them.

Yes, because you need to convert manually the PCX textures to TGA, PNG or DDS, but soon I'll add support for it, so you can load them while load the model. Probably in a few hours I update the tool ;D

Updated the tool with PCX support.
Textures will now be loaded automatically when loading a model, as long as the selected format is TGA.

You can update the tool from Blender by activating the checkbox "Check updates" and hit 'Enter' or downloading the below file and installing on Blender through 'Edit' -> 'Preferences' and clicking in 'Install...' button.

What's new?
- Now textures can be converted directly from PCX when a model is loaded if you choose 'TGA' on the drop-down menu.
- Now you can extract DEMO.DAT and VOX.DAT.

Can you give more information?
It's very difficult to help you in this way, does the blender console show you any information?
You can open it from 'Window' -> 'Toggle System Console'.

I've uploaded it again because the last build has something wrong 
This doesn't affect those who have updated the tool through Blender itself.

You need to re add the link to the tool here since it's been removed.

Thanks.
