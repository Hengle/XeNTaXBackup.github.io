I realized that the files are encrypted. I have a little speed Internet, and I poured a small current file.

The game can be downloaded here:

uhmm it's strange because in the past the games that used starforce had their files all encrypted in an unique archive acting as a file system (disk image) and having a particular signature at the beginning, while in this case the file is just signless like directly encrypted.

anyway we will wait the next days to see if will be released a demo or a nocd

Maybe there is any 2-way cloaking encryption. Standard SF filesystem + some xor over final archive to remove header visibility. All I know there is SF + Online activation. But because there is Steam version of game, maybe there are 2 versions of game and 2 different protections

Hope i didn't get your hopes up, it's not a tool or a crack, just the basic steam version files to help others decode it. even the steam .s3darcs are weird or encrypted somehow from what i've seen.
