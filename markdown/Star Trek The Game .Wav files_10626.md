- Post Title: Star Trek: The Game .Wav files

UPDATE: BMS script worked fine. The .wav files are compressed. PM if interested!

I know that this game is very similar to the Darkness II's files ([viewtopic.php?f=10&t=8120](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=8120)) and I've successfully extracted the files but most of the files seem corrupted - especially the .wav files. 

I also had a couple of other observations:

- wav files about 1MB or less import into Audacity as noise and static
- some files have the music but play too fast with a lot of static
- There's an archive that's only 20MB and has the same file names (but only 1KB) of the archive that has the actual music/SFX. Viewing these in a hex editor makes them look like they're loop data or something of the nature.
- There's also a third archive that has 64.1KB wav files that have the same names of the main files. I'm not sure what these do.

It's a good thing I only paid < $10 for it - sure is a runner up for the worst Star Trek game ever...great music though.  



Anyways give me a PM if interested.
