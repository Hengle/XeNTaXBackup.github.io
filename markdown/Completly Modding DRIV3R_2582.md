- Post Title: Completly Modding DRIV3R

I found these forums by researching a user who had created a small utility for DRIV3R who I have only been able to contact today. Previously I hadn't been able to contact him as their was some form of issue with the emails I was sending along the way. Anyways this is not the point of this post.

As you can see by the title I am trying to mod DRIV3R, in fact I'm trying to mod every single possible element or at least work out what the files purposes are, I hope to achieve this and when I found this community I was so excited as I'll be able to work out what all the files do, currently I have done a lot of work to find out what files do what however I want to get the entire picture and work out what every single files purpose is and if it has any sub purposes.

I've taken a look around the forums and it looks like there are some very smart and intelligent minds in this area and I'm hoping to get your help. I would like to write my own tools as well however I merely have the knowledge of C\C++ and I guess at the present time I can do with a script for your tool. Also noting that I haven't purchased your product as I only have $5 AU dollars which is about US$8.75 dollars and I can't seem to convert these in pay pal so I'm wondering what my options are in purchasing these scripts if I have the chance.

So basically you know I'm trying to totally mod DRIV3R and if there are some impossible files, I would like to work out what their purpose in the game is. So my next question is what do I need to give to you and how to do this? (If this is any help, I can upload files from the full game just for you to download, I'll try to get one of every file type and I don't think it will take that it will be that big because there arn't all that many different types of files and there file sizes are fairly small, so one of each type of file could total up to somewhere around 200MB. Also noting that I have a host where I can host these files.

Sadly, I don't have much information on the game at the present time because I left it at home and I'm typing this up somewhere else however once you have answered a few questions in this post, I should be home to give you answers and even upload the necessary files.

Now before I go and finish this post I won't forget to mention about the information on these pages:

The user how I was talking about before created a tool to open these files. It was a good tool as it was the only one however it's quite hard to use and it takes a while just to move one texture into the archieve. I Contact him about the issue and see if he can do anymore to the program and if not maybe one of the archiving tools around this community could help unless it is possible for someone to create an entirely new program.

This is kind of the same as the above, so I won't worry about copying the text.

[http://wiki.xentax.com/index.php/Driver_3_XA](http://wiki.xentax.com/index.php/Driver_3_XA)

I know there is a .XA to .WAV converter however we can't convert the other way around so I'm hoping we can convert these the other way around from .wav to .xa.

Also side noting that I have in fact decided to create a website showing all the file information about all the files in the DRIVER series, however I'm starting off with DRIV3R as this is the main game I wish to mod at the time until Driver: Parallel Lines comes out.

So I hope you can help my project.
