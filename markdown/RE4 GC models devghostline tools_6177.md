- Post Title: RE4 GC models: /dev/ghostline tools?

I can't find these anywhere, they seem to have vanished off the net. Really, I've looked very hard. Does anyone around here have them?
The tools I'm looking for are: emdscan, obdumper, and txdumper.

However, as far as I can tell obdumper would only give me the raw mesh, which is not what I want, I'd rather have the skeleton and the animations as well. From what I've gathered, they are inside the .bin files which in turn are packed in the .dat's in the em folder.

It seems like the .bin files are slightly modified PMD files (from the PC version) but I can't find a tool to turn them into PMD's.

If someone more knowledgeable (as in, has live links, or goes by the name of MarkGrass or St. Vampire  [looks like they are the authorities on the subject]) would like to join in...

Just kidding.
