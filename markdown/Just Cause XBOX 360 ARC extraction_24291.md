I already tried BMS and several other ARC and Just Cause extractors but none seems to be able to handle the JC1 Xbox 360 version. Not even the JC2 Xbox 360 ARC script works. I was able to successfully extract both PC and PS2 version but no dice with the Xbox 360 version.

I wanted to do a Soundtrack rip and was wondering if the XB360 version has better quality since the other platforms have 22khz sources. I also know that the sound format here is XWB/XSB, because there is a file list of stuff included in the ARC archives in the iso, which doesnt really help me since I wasnt able to extract the ARC archives so far. There is also xbox360.tab file.

I uploaded all the arc and other files here: [https://mega.nz/file/RWxEzKoB#ogdySGynC ... vUzFnsOL2w](https://mega.nz/file/RWxEzKoB#ogdySGynC9oaFdyzic4r_sD6ilXrcg2YmvUzFnsOL2w)

Maybe someone know how this can be extracted?



UPDATE: Game Extractor by WattoStudios added support for this archive now! If you didn't know about this program yet, I highly recommend it. It is the best AiO solution for file extraction and ripping.

Sadly the XB360 music files are also only 22khz so I guess all platforms only have 22khz music files. Bit of a shame.
