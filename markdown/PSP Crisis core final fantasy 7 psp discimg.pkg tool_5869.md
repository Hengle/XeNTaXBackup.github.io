How to:-This tool will extract all files from Crisis core final fantasy 7 psp discimg.pkg[usa]file

1.Extract the ripkit folder (with winrar) & put your discimg.pkg into the same folder(extracted with UmdGen) and run the extract.bat this will extract all the files
2.Then downsample but keep the same name,but if the files are bigger it will not be added.(to downsample read the tutorials)
3.Run the rebuild.bat this will then inject the files back in!!(Put the new discimg.pkg back in using UmdGen or WQSG_UMD_R31)
4.When you cso your iso it will be smaller!!
5.Make a ripkit!!!!!

many thanks to Gnie and skybladecloud for the tools

So, would this allow you to create various texture edits then, similar to the various Dissidia ones?

I think Noesis can do this manually, now. Just open the ISO and select the pkg, and it'll rip out all the models.

Hi guys, the tool works well, but when i try to change the English AT3 files (Cutscene voices) with the Japan at3 (i want undub the game!)
then when i repack the discimg.pkg and put it back in the iso with UMDgen, the game crash instead...

I think that the problem is "discimg.fse" (maybe must be updated as well, but i don't know how to do..)

I would like to make a eur undub of this game... thx anyway.

PM me thx!
