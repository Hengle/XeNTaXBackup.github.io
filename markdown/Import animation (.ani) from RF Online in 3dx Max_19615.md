Hello to all!
Sorry for my English (google translator) I'm from Russia.

Is there a tool for importing into 3d max animation ".ani" from RF Online game?

I know about the existence of FatImporter, but as I was told that it is crookedly importing animation for RF Online.
It distorts the model when playing.
I was given one normal animation imported through another private program (they donâ€™t give it to me).
She's great.
