Maybe somebody can edit the frostbite.bms from aluigui to be compatible with this Game.

80% of the files extracted looks like this:
a20f7dcba33551a98b56ef2b6b6c57ac
5c683591b76e8b9218f3d67ac2ef7eb4
27fda4b863c22660252da98ec2470108

the header on 3 files its some like this:
file1: .....p~exÚl.w\.ÇûÇ.¦¢ØbÁ–¨Ø•Î.Üí-E8š.åb.%¶Ø.c‰AE
file2: .....p.ZxÚd.{\TÕÚÇ÷\¸¨¨(Šš.0¯€ .3.Ã.÷ÙÃ€÷£VïÑ.Vj
file3: .....pŽ&xÚ”.wTSÙ÷ö/.ì.pd¬XQ.i)·%¹.!¡.PgÔ±#vì:b.‘

maybe only need put extension to files and load with correct program.

I'd love to get these extracted myself...I'm wanting to see close-ups of the models for references and such, maybe a small fan-animation later.
