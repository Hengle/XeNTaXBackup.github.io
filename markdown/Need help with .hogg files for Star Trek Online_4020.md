I got a silly idea last nite and tried to use the "Pigg Viewers" from CoX in hopes that it might recognize the very familiar Hogg files... but no luck.

Here are the two pigg viewers incase you guys want to take a look.

and

[http://coh.coldfront.net/index.php/content/view/339/58/](http://coh.coldfront.net/index.php/content/view/339/58/)

Just thought I would post this incase it might help.

It's a different format than CoX's piggs (aptly named hogg).

I previously wrote an extractor for Champions Online, Star Trek Online uses the same format.

First of all I would like to thank you for this. Sadly, I don't know how to use it lol 

I open the file and it just blinks and closes. What do I need to do to get this puppy working rite?

Thank you ahead of time for your help and patients.

It's a console tool. You give it two arguments.

Gibbed.Champions.Bacon.exe <input hogg file> <output directory>

so I extracted the sounds.hogg but a lot of the files were corrupted and didn't play rite. So I thought I got a bad download/installation. So I just reloaded and reinstalled it, extracted the sounds again and it will still giving me corrupt files.

The extracted sound files look fine to me, how are you determining they are corrupt?

Edit: they load and play fine with fmod code, they're not corrupt.

So I found this thread and used the extractor on the .hogg files but I can't realy find what I am looking for. I am new to this type of thing and as such pretty clueless. Granted I got the files, I just don't know how to search many of them or what software I need to do that. For example, I would like to extract item names and attribute values and additionally the bridge officer abilities and the associated description from the STO game files. Anyone have any information on that? It would be much appreciated. I'm trying to make a resource web site without having to go in game and type all the information out a little bit at a time. I don't believe cryptic has provided any kind of API to capture this data from users either. 

Help!

Most assuredly none of that information is in the game files... Instead, it resides on the servers and is transmitted to the client when you look at your items.  The game files only include graphics, sound, and the code to display everything.

Any idea if it is possible to capture that data then? I know other games actually provide a way to get at and capture this type of information but I don't think STO does yet, but I don't know enough about it either way. Help?

I've been using the above tool to extract the information from Star Trek Online's hogg files, but I'm running into a slight problem.  For some reason, every time I try to extract info from to of the hogg files I'm told there are 0 files inside of the file, despite the fact that one of them is 1.69 GB.  I could've swore it worked before, but now (they just released Season 3) it just gives me that message.

Anybody have an idea why it isn't working right?

Thanks.

if you havent done so already, create an Output folder, then select the .hogg you want to extract and the output folder and drag them onto the .exe file and your done, the rest is automatic.

(I wasn't able to download the file in the browser but jdownloader worked. Backup link: [https://mega.nz/file/DJ0hkLRK#X6pkyT5tA ... QHdCiINhTo](https://mega.nz/file/DJ0hkLRK#X6pkyT5tAg2rusFFmYhOx470ENpn9oEggQHdCiINhTo) )

THANK YOU!

This actually works for neverwinter cryptic

It's a command-line tool, so you have to run the exe in the command line

```
Unpack a hogg file
usage: Gibbed.Champions.Bacon inputPath outputPath [/o]
    inputPath   input hogg file
    outputPath  output directory
    [/o]        overwrite existing files

```

I am attempting to extract some .hogg files from a NWO private server. When using the Gibbed Champions tool, I get an error "bad hogg version". Any updated tools to extract properly? Or is this possible user error?
