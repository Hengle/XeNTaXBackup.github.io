- Post Title: List of PSP games use GMO format

There's no sense in creating a thread, cause this information is on the wiki. I just added it today, in fact.

[http://wiki.xentax.com/index.php/Supported_Games](http://wiki.xentax.com/index.php/Supported_Games)

I see some additions in this list though. I don't remember if I had them in there or if someone else added them. Pretty sure "Bleach Heat the Soul series" wasn't in there, because I'm fairly sure a number of the pre-7 games didn't use GMO. If those additions are confirmed to actually have GMO files, feel free to add them to the wiki list.
