- Post Title: Elden Ring .smd Models

Hello, since many people were looking for the elden ring models, here I leave you all the characters that elden ring has, they are in .smd format but both noesis and blender open that type of file

here the links
Noesis: [https://richwhitehouse.com/index.php?co ... sv4464.zip](https://richwhitehouse.com/index.php?content=inc_projects.php&filemirror=noesisv4464.zip)

Blender plugin: [http://steamreview.org/BlenderSourceTools/](http://steamreview.org/BlenderSourceTools/)

and most importantly the models link: Mod Edit (Removed link)

Thank you very much for everything devilmayplay96, one question I am new in this world and I have no idea how to use the files you have passed.

Can you explain me what programs I need? With blender I can open and see the models?

Thank you very much for everything

edit: okay, it's quite easy to understand, you have to open the models in noasis

edit2: In blender I installed the plugin, but when I open the folder where the models are, it appears empty.

Hello. Thank you for the models. I'm trying to import a character model to elden ring, and my question is are the steps for that the same as sekiro and ds3? I've tried now multiple times by using the base female elden ring chr model, but the fingers never line up.
