Hello again.
I'd like to request help on this format. Tried to understand it for quite some time without getting anywhere at all. I'd like to know how the sounds can be converted or played on PC.

Here are some files for research:
[http://www.sendspace.com/file/7nkr36](http://www.sendspace.com/file/7nkr36)
It contains 2 sounds in .aud format, one .sam sound (with some additional files) and one stream file without any file format name...
Thanks in advance.

Good call. I haven't been able to decode these, either. The rest of the game's music stuff can be decoded with foobar2000 and the vgmstream plugin, though.
