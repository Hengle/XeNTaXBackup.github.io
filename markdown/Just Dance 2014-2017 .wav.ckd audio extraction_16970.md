- Post Title: Just Dance 2014-2017 *.wav.ckd audio extraction

Hello guys! I'm trying to extract the audio from JD2014 through JD2017 ]9because all of them have the same file structure) but i could find nothing about how to convert it to an normal audio file! I even searched the forum and used the Rayman for PC converter, but it didn't worked...

Someone have an idea what i can do to extract those files?

Thanks guys!
