- Post Title: How can I determine which normalmap format is used?

Hello!

I would like to create normalmaps for modified textures.
I found out that the original normalmap picture had only two channels (green and alpha) the other two (red and blue) were empty/blank/black.

I think I should create a common normalmap (with nvdxt.exe) from heightmap (I have to create it too), and then I have to swap/change/mix the RGBA channels.
But how can I determine which channels form the needed green and alpha channels?

I hope my question is clear!

Thanks
