Hi every one. In this file:
[http://www.sindii-soft.pwp.blueyonder.c ... Engine.rar](http://www.sindii-soft.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/GameEngine.rar)
Have a folder named data. In that folder have a file named

He didn't make the models or animations.
I've made a 3d mario game using Unity engine myself, it was on this games portal called Wooglie, and I didn't make the assets myself either.
The models and animations are extracted from some mario game, cant remember the name. I think it's for GameCube or xbox, can't remember which console but I was able to extract the assets and there was import script for 3ds max to import models WITH animations
