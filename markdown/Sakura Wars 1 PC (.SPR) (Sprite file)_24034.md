It seems that SPR file format is supported by Game Viewer [http://game-viewer.org/](http://game-viewer.org/)
with this plugin installed [http://game-viewer.org/plugin.php?id=50](http://game-viewer.org/plugin.php?id=50)

After installing the plugin, you will be able view images or convert them to jpg
