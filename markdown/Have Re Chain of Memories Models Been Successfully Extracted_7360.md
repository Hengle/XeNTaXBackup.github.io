- Post Title: Have Re Chain of Memories Models Been Successfully Extracted

I have heard that it is not possible to extract the models from RCOM, which is quite unfortunate. Has there been any success in getting them? I am interested since the battle quotes are found inside the models, if we are going by what happened in KH1 and KH2.

Not at all no. Not much point, you can get all of them from the other games, except for a few of them.

Well, if it is like the others, then the battle voice quotes will be inside the model. I really wanted to get the ReCOM models in order to have the rest of the Orgs english battle quotes, as well as Richard Epcar's Ansem.
