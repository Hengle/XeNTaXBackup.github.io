- Post Title: Aladdin Nasira's revenge PSx midi request

I want to rip the music files then convert them to mid, I've used VGMtoolbox with no luck.. the music in CSV format I can play them using PSound convert it to wav and using movie converter to xa.. but that's what I can do.. I wish if anyone can make this for me or tell me how should I rip psf or whatever to have sequence music.
