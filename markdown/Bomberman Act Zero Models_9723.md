- Post Title: Bomberman Act Zero Models

I know this game is terrible, but I'd really like to have the player models from this game. The iso extracted is only 453mb as 96 .DAT files. The first four seem to contain tutorial/loading screen text in different languages but the rest I have no idea. Any help would be appreciated, I've uploaded the first .dat file and all of them in one 7z.

Ah I forget it was case sensitive, the z on the extension needed to be lowercase, the link should work now.
