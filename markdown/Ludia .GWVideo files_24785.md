I need help modding Ludia games. Is there a way I can demux and mux .GWVideo files?

Well, this sample you provided is not really a video file.
It's some container for PNG files. 
You can extract them all using File Stripper or similar program

And when you'll put all files together, you'll see that they are part of some animation which probably is displayed instead of regular video
