Some meshes(.crf) seem to load fine into blender with [https://github.com/sbobovyc/JA-BiA-Tool ... d-objects)](https://github.com/sbobovyc/JA-BiA-Tools/wiki/Working-with-CRF-%283d-objects%29)

But what are those .caf animation files, is it cryengine format?
Or this: [https://github.com/mp3butcher/Cal3D](https://github.com/mp3butcher/Cal3D)
Any help/hints on this appreciated!

How did you extract the files? I can't find anything.
