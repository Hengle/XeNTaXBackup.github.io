I've managed to partially extract some of the svr pac files. Different pac files seem to have different file contents. Files contained have headers such as bumpmap, cubemap, dxt1, and dds. does anybody know of a viewer for these files?

I've uploaded a few files I've extracted. I've given the files .pac extensions as I didn't know what to name them after extracting. Any help would be appreciated.

These are just standered DXT textures, you didnt extract them right. You need to select from "DDS " to the end of the dds texture, then save it as w/e.dds and you can view it with most image editors.
