Import tool for Ratchet and Clank and Resistance game series.
You'll need my AllExtractor tool, to correctly use extracted files.



Detailed information and tool download.

Like I said, all games that can AllExtractor extract, that should be all game releases from Resistance 2 to last their Last PS3 game (Into the nexus I believe). Everything is already said on AllExtractors page.
