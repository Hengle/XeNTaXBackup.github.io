Dear user, 

If you really really really like MultiEx Commander, you may support us. As a return favour we will donate you a registration code for MultiEx Commander. But how? Here are some options!

1. Donating a little so we can maintain the website and keep up the work on the tool. We are also in the process of setting up a WIKI that will collect all the game archive formats we can master. 
Go to :
[http://multiex.xentax.com/donate/index.html](http://multiex.xentax.com/donate/index.html)


2. Send us 15 emailaddresses of news editors of game related sites (e.g. games in general, modding in general, or specific games) plus a reference to the actual site, so we can get into contact with them and know they exists. Send those to :

Please use "MULTIEX PRESS" in the subject line. 

3. Write scripts for MultiEx Commander, or give tips on how to add support for new games not yet supported, figuring out archive formats and so on. 
You can use our forums to help us. Also, when the WIKI is up and running, you can join the project there! 

4. Link to us from your own (fairly popular) game site and writing an article about MultiEx Commander. 

5. Any other way of cool support you can think of! 

Thanks VERY much, 

The XeNTaX Crew

It's like a website that anyone, even complete strangers, can edit and make additions to. You'll see.

Okay, so it's sort of like a forum, then... I know of some examples, but can't think of any...

Okay, well, PayPal is also supporting money transfer from a bank account. 

> Are you looking for an alternative to credit cards for your online transactions? If so, why not send money from your PayPal balance directly?

>
> To do this, you simply transfer money from your bank account to your PayPal account:
>
> 
>
>     * Click the â€œAdd Fundsâ€œ tab on the Account Overview page.
>
> 
>
>     * Copy the bank details that will display, including the special identification code, and paste them into the bank transfer slip/sheet from your local bank.
>
> 
>
>     * Within 3-4 working days, the funds will be transferred to your PayPal account balance.

So, you can transfer money from your bank account to Paypal and then to other Paypal accounts. All free. 

If you wish to directly transfer money from a Dutch bank account to ours PM me to discuss that.

Is it possible to get a serial number for this application by donating a similar but not the exact amount, all I have is $5AU Dollars and when I convert it using [http://www.xe.com](http://www.xe.com) it's $4.16USD or 3.07EURO. I thought it was the other way around, but I'm wondering if this is possible for now :S

This is really all I have and I'm not sure how to get any other paypal in there at the moment, or for at least another couple of months.
