- Post Title: Trine 2 b3d?

Hello, I've tried to import into Blender Trine 2's models, but... I couldn't. Models are in a "custom" b3d format apparently (perhaps compressed? files are like... 7-11Kb lol), and textures .fbi/dds. Any help on this would be greatly appreciated! 

You can download a demo of this awesome game here: [http://store.steampowered.com/app/35720](http://store.steampowered.com/app/35720)

(p.s: there are a couple of Trine topics... but they are really old and, not related)
