I'm uncertain of the format used here but it gets defined as a "multiresource" and seems to serve some function of data used in the game that gets in the way of further modding (adding new talismans and etc) so if an identification of this file can be made that would be cool. All I know is that each of these DAT files contain a CGSR header. I'm uncertain of a means to edit this but the game defines it as a "multiresource" which seems to indicate a kind of archive.

Ok I've figured out that all files in Revenant that have that header are a form of model. 2D and 3D. Hm... the problem now is that there is only an exporter (yet to get working) and no way to open the I3Ds/I2Ds/BINs.

Sorry to bump this old old thread but I have gained a renewed interest in modding this game thanks to being able to play it on my new computer. XD What I want to be able to do is insert new images into the gamedata.dat file. In particular, I want to import new "something"candy images to get new working talismans working. 

Update: Copying and pasting files breaks what it calls the "bitmap list" so still trying to figure out how to add a new image to the bitmap resource list. Apparently there may be some indexing here rather than just storing things by name value alone. As said, ultimately I want to add files to the list to enable the three locked talismans rather than hack the spells they are needed for. Any help is appreciated.  Apparently others are interested in tools/methods for Revenant hacking as well. I've managed a bit of it but the file formats are troublesome and tools are only way outdated exporters.
