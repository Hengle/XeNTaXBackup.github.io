- Post Title: Making a universal model fixer tool (Need help)

Hey all!

A friend and I made a mesh fixing script (1) for MGS3 assets.
The Jayveer plugin has some issues like vertex winding order, the script bruteforces the winding order and welds vertices by distance.

We want to make this into a dedicated tool, like how Materialize is a tool made inside of Unity. Though I lack a lot of knowledge when it comes to model exporting during runtime in Unity and my C# knowledge is still limited.

If you're good at C# and/or you're a faster learner than I am, ofcourse also have the time to help; Add me on Discord!   (Same username as here)

Please help if you can!
