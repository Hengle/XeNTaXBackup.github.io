- Post Title: MT Framework .mod Conversion tool?

I came across this tool that was able to convert PS3 RE5 .mods into the PC RE5 .mod format to make them usable on PC.
[http://residentevilmodding.boards.net/t ... ol-release](http://residentevilmodding.boards.net/thread/1225/ps3-mod-conversion-tool-release)

I was wondering if it would be possible to modify this tool to be able to convert other .mod formats.
Like for example, RE6 PC .mods into REVELATIONS 2 .mods, Or Vice versa.

Im not at all code savvy so i wouldnt even know where to start! But if anyone is interested maybe this will be helpful.

RE5/RE6/REREV/REREV2 mod file formats are extremely similar. It won't be hard for someone to do.

Why do you need to do this though? As far as I'm aware the same model files exist across all platforms thus there's no need unless you're trying to port brand newly created models by fans from the PC engine to other platforms?

My idea was Mainly just to be able to convert the PC .mods from one game to another to make them playable in that game. As if it was like a model swap.
