- Post Title: PlayStation 3 .pkg Files

Hey @lltogether,

I am looking for a way to decompress these .pkg files on the PlayStation 3.
You run into them when downloading from the PlayStation Network for example.
I'm including a link to content downloadable from the PSN for free.
([http://tinyurl.com/ps3pkg](http://tinyurl.com/ps3pkg)) About 4MB. Should contain at least a .p3t PS3 theme file.
I hope anyone can help me.
Thanx in advance

Tattva

To clarify, the content is encrypted and since the encryption keys are on the PS3 system, it's not possible at this time.
