It's better if you post the original file.

I used Alpha's "AT3 To AA3+Smpl" script to on the file you uploaded and then opened up the .AA3 file with Sony Sound Forge 10 Pro and it played back just fine.

I uploaded the converted .AA3 file and also a PCM WAV of the file as well [here](http://www.mediafire.com/?md72a6a64sc6kp9)

Well, the file you uploaded is a normal AT3 not even plus.  So adding the AA3 header is way to easy, brendan19 says he did it but I didn't see anything in the link he posted :S even going in with my own account.

What I like to ask is why are there so many fillin zeros at the end?

Your file specs are:

48kHz
Mono
128kbps

Anyway, I uploaded this one in flac and the converted AT3 to AA3.
