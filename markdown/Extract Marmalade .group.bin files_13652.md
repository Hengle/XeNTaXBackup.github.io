- Post Title: Extract Marmalade *.group.bin files

Long (really long) time no post!

I'm wondering if someone could help with the attached file. It's a .group.bin file from a game made with Marmalade. 

I think it just contains graphics, but have no idea what format they are in.

Thanks in advance for any clues!

Thanks. Silly me, TextureFinder should have been my first port of call.

*another edit*

Is there any tool that can automatically extract the textures? I've tried a couple and they don't recognise any files within....
