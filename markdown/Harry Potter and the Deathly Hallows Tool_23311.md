- Post Title: Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Tool

Tool for previewing/exporting skinned models from Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1. I haven't tested it for Part 2 yet. I might take a look at the maps later. Materials are also supported, but only diffuse and normal textures will be mapped at export.

Example exported models





How to use

Decompress
Models are in bin.gz files and these files are compressed. Decompress them first using [offzip](https://aluigi.altervista.org/mytoolz/offzip.zip). Like this:

offzip -a ma_malfoymanor.bin.gz outfoldername

This will output a single .dat file inside the given folder.

Load

DAT: Loads the .dat extracted by offzip. It will contain multiple models. Change between models using the arrow keys.
Export

NUX: Exports the model to a custom binary format (.nux), intended to be loaded by Noesis. Noesis script for this format : NUX Script
Textures: Exports the textures in PNG format.
Note : Models and textures will be exported into the folder Export.

Thank you very much for this! Hope you will implement map support.

Edit: Tested with part 2 but it doesn't work. The viewer doesn't shows any error, simply anything is loaded, just to let you know.

Can we use this tool to create a book accurate color mod? For example change Voldemort’s eyes to red?
