Yeah, okay, an infamous old game from the darkest corner of Point & Click hell as a request but heck, feeling worth a shot!

The main data files don't appear compressed, or complex. Inventory BMPs extract flawlessly as do sound effects, but actor sheets don't seem to. Using X-Ripper gives corrupt BMPs, however.
