Hi!

Is there any method to open/unpack OVL localization files in Jurassic World Evolution?

I want to translate the game into polish language.

Please help!

As a first step, I'd recommend opening them in your favorite hex editor and inspecting the headers (the first several dozen characters in the file). This might tell you more about their format, and let you search these forums and the web for tools to extract.
