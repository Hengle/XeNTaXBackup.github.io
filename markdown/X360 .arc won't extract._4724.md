Personally, unless someone actually tells the game they are working on, I don't even bother trying anything.  Just saying.

I thought I told you, I got the FileVersion and the NumberOfFiles backwards. Switch those 2 and you got yourself a deal.

Holy shit, I don't visit the site everyday...I rarely visit at all...

I told you guys how to fix it.

```
hd.FileCount = br.ReadInt16();
```


SHOULD BE

```
hd.Version = br.ReadInt16();

```


EASY FIX!

Now stop bugging me. I gave you source and exe...

Could someone figure out the compression?

I don't think that it's Xmemcompress or Zlib 

Please?
