- Post Title: Hitman Absolution [PC]

Hi, does anyone know how to encrypt/open these files from new Hitman game? [http://www.mediafire.com/?ja238z3u3j68fiy](http://www.mediafire.com/?ja238z3u3j68fiy) 
I tried to find some text, and these files are probably hiding the text stuff.

Thanks for any ideas.

not encrypted but compressed probably xmemcompress. I was able to decompress all files from X360 version but never had a chance to look for texts yet. Also you violating rules on this forum by your post of the archive!

I'm not violating anything, everyone who wants to share the important files with other members (not any crack files) can post that on this forum (maybe the others haven't these files on their pc)!!

You're posting your links on forum too and it's allright??? It's bit strange, isn't it?! You think you're a King of forum or what ? no, you're just a spamming machine, so get lost!
