When I was so young computer games feels like heaven but some years older , I found Xentax coincidence , when I learned how we can open archives then I ascended to higher level paradise enjoying all things in my life for few years period ...
Then falling in job , responsibilities , society ... Take me away so that now I am not only on the ground even I descended into dark underground !

I understand human life is too short even 120 years old .
I wish I could live thousands years ?

Just thank you Mike for making all the good times for everyone is here 

My post resemble biblical text ? 
God bless you all 

Your sincerely Fereydoon Shekofte
