- Post Title: Ultimate Spider-Man (PC) .WBK

Header: "WAVEBK11" / Ext: ".WBK", which is supported in "Game Extractor" by "WATTO" though for the Spider-Man 2 (PC) game and not working on this one, 
I have cut a partial 5 MB of the file so you guys can check it out whenever you're free and willing to give it a shot. 

Also I've provided a link to some other file I found in the same directory named "string_hash_dictionary.txt" it seems to have the complete list of everything, 
I read somewhere around here about these hashes or something, in this case there's that and it's filenames in it, hope it helps if not much at least a little bit!    

As for the .WBK  filename, I presume it is an audio archive, I hear pieces per few seconds lapses upon importing it ''RAW'' inside of Audacity. 
I'm not sure if this is the proper section I should've made the topic, so if required please move it to where it should've been, thank you.

I've been digging into this game recently. WBK format appears appears to be same as Spider-Man 2 except it doesn't contain file names. You can still use a QuickBMS script from here: [http://zenhax.com/viewtopic.php?p=3504#p3504](http://zenhax.com/viewtopic.php?p=3504#p3504) to extract it, just remove lines related to file naming, like this:
[http://pastebin.com/CFWHHhVZ](http://pastebin.com/CFWHHhVZ)

I've hit another problem, though, audio in PC version appears to use IMA ADPCM encoding but I just can't find the correct interleave. It's clearly different from PS2 version interleave (0x800). Any help with this? Here's an example file: [http://www2.zippyshare.com/v/sHOEm7fS/file.html](http://www2.zippyshare.com/v/sHOEm7fS/file.html) The sampling rate of all music is 36.0 kHz.

I've already extracted the music from PS2 version earlier using FastElbJa's ADPCM Player but I'm still interested in PC version.

For the PC version of the game... I wouldn't suggest you even touch it... just saying.

Also, there's a folder in the PC port where the music and sounds can be found. THAT's how SIMPLE the PC port of the game is.

P.S. DO NOT play/ take the PC port seriously. If you do so, then you'll regret that decision... It's a disgrace and a mistake, it's even worse than Sonic 06!!!

I was hoping that if you are successful, these sounds could be submitted to The Sounds Resource.

Figured I'd bump this because I've recently fully figured out WBK format in this game so I can extract all the audio files with correct names.
Would anyone be interested in a complete sound rip of this game (and, by extension, Spider-Man 2 since it's on the same engine)? If yes, what would be the best place to post it?

I'm interested, I also think the best way to post them would be on Google Drive. Make sure you send us the link.

Hey man this thread is deader than dead at this point but I'm currently determined to crack this open and try to overhaul the ingame cutscenes/audio. If youre still around and this offer still stands I would greatly appreciate it bro.

Good luck with that my dude!  I'm currently just personally interested in trying to get the music from the game but guess YouTube will have to do for now.

Whatever happened to this too? In my case, I am interested. Guess one person's interest at the time wasn't enough. :/

Also I gotta ask, what drugs is this guy smoking? Ultimate Spider-Man's PC port is alright aside from needing to use Steam's controller configuration tool and the first cutscene's small glitches. It's much better than Saints Row 2's and GTA IV's infamous PC ports for that matter. Sonic '06 is infamously bad but I wouldn't even compare it at all to USM on the PC since it didn't even get a PC port.

I am late but after so long, I have finally found out that they were uploaded over on the sprite database for whatever reason despite them being audio files and not png's and whatnot Lol: [https://spritedatabase.net/game/3208](https://spritedatabase.net/game/3208)
