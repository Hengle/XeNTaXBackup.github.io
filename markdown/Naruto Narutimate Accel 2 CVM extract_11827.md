- Post Title: Naruto Narutimate Accel 2 CVM extract

I have been looking for a way to extract the files within the games DATA.CVM file, but have had no luck what so ever.
I was trying to use the eeMemory.bin from a pcsx2 save state to retrieve the TOC, but for the life of me cannot figure out what I'm looking for.
If someone could look at my eeMemory.bin and see if they can find anything I would be very grateful.

Thanks for any help in advance.
