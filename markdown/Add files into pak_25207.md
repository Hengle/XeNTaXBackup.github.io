- Post Title: Add files into pak

Hello, I have the question, so far i can reimport edited files into pak using QuickBMS with script, but is there anyway to add new files into the same pak? Or just turn the entire folder into the pak. I dont know if anyone asked it before but thanks in advanced

That really depeonds on what kind of PAK format you are talking about.
You see, there are hundreds of games using this extension [http://wiki.xentax.com/index.php/Category:Extension_pak](http://wiki.xentax.com/index.php/Category:Extension_pak)
(only few of them are categorized on the wiki, but there are a lot more...)

So you need to specify few things first:
- What is the name of the game you are trying to mod?
- What is the script you are talking about? Can you link it here?
- Can you add a few samples of PAK files (if they are not too big)?
- Why do you need to add new files?
