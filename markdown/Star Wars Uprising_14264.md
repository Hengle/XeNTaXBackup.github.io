Alright so i've been searching and trying just about every unity tool and script released here an even google searching try and find something to open these files but nothing is working.

This game runs on unity 5.3.2f1 and a old version of it's obb i have i'm able to extract models and textures from it but there have been many updates to this game with new armor,enemies...ect and i'd really like to get some of those.

Here are 2 sample assetbundles for you guys to see what you can do with.
