- Post Title: Tales of Symphonia (PS2) .sfd

I decided to (try) ripping the cutscenes from the Playstation 2 Tales of Symphonia, however, i've run into a problem
I've managed to extract the .sfd files from the TOSMOV.cvm by using ROFS/CVM to iso converter, I can convert the .sfd's but no video....

-using sfd2mpg I've only gotten the audio
-Cube Media Player 2 it's the same thing, the audio will play, but it can't seem to open the video.

any help/ideas fellas?

EDIT: okay so by changing the .sfd extension to .mp4 i can view the video, the colors are a bit screwed up as well as playback, but they are somewhat viewable....still looking for a solution though.

I already had those files and the qube media player could play them (even convert them?, not sure),
which version of the cube media player are you using?

Edit: sfd video is just a standard MPEG1 stream which they tampered with (if I remember correctly) so
there was a way of extracting said stream (of course you have to convert+remux the audio)
the audio (which can be extracted seperatly if it isn't interleaved) is probably in the adx file format

Which version of sfd2mpg do you use? (is there any version information at all?)

Okay, i'm using v2.05.0117 of Cube Media Player, 

as for sfd2mpg, apparently the last time it was modified was in "2000/12/29" however there's a .txt from "2003/3/02", either way, there's a good chance it's an old version....

like i said before, i've already gotten the audio so no worries there...just can't seem to get the video out.


(Fake Edit): Heh, okay after playing around with Cube Media Player, i figured out how to convert the videos, for whatever reason i just can't play them through CMP.

EDIT: okay this is weird....the video converts just fine (i guess), but the color is really odd it's oversatured and bright, and somehow the hue seems to be off, when i try adjusting it in VLC player, i can't seem to get results that are any better. Perhaps it's the way i'm coverting it, i'll play around with some more options and post back later.
