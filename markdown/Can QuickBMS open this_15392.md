- Post Title: Can QuickBMS open this?

I've heard of one person unpacking this .TDB file full of in-game textures, but even after a couple of people asked, they never shared the textures with anyone. I've been trying to open it using QuickBMS with no luck - can it be opened with the right settings (am I doing something wrong)?

I can upload the full file off-site if needed. I'm showing the top part of the file only.

Woops, that info would help...

Fur Fighters (PC)
texdb.tdb

And I'm trying to create a script for it (which is why I'm wondering if it's something I'm doing wrong) since there doesn't seem to be an existing one for it.
