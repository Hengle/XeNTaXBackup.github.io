Hitman 6 tools.
Current state: all skeletal and most static models can be extracted with skeletons and textures. You must be able to get and check models now and start finding their hashes.

When run, the tool will output a model in SMD & ASCII, and a material text file with a list of all materials used by this model. All these textures will be extracted to corresponding folders.

To work, the tool needs rpkg.ini and/or rpkg_patch.ini - list of packages to look for models, you must edit it with your folder names.

1. run tool without parameters
It will output a list of skeletal models in all packages from RPKG.ini
So if you want only models from DLC5, delete other lines from RPKG.ini
For example, run Hitman6 > list.txt and it will create list.txt
This list has hash, size, number of materials for each model.
you have an idea, if it has 10 materials and its big, its probably character

2. to get one model, run the tool like   Hitman6 6D1BF1B36511FD
this will create hitman's tie

3. to get all models in a list, run  Hitman6 list.txt or drop list.txt onto the EXE

4. to get all models as game tree, run  Hitman6 all or Hitman6 alltxt



Cloth is weighted to the main skeleton

Well done!   

Does this also use data from any of the following?

MATB <- RENDER MATERIAL EntityBlueprint
MATE <- RENDER MATERIAL EFFECT
MATI <- RENDER MATERIAL INSTANCE
MATT <- RENDER MATERIAL ENTITY TYPE

The material setup looks accurately done

I'm not exactly clear which one you consider "Hitman 6".  The list of games is this:



If I go in chronological order, 6 would be Absolution. Is that what this is for, or is it another game?

Any chance that this can be updated to work on Hitman Sniper Assassin as well? It uses the same type of archives as Hitman 2016.

New version (first post updated)

1. Full game tree extraction

Run Hitman6 all or Hitman6 alltxt

This will extract all models from all files listed in INI files, and put them into folders according to game tree. For example, if some hitman outfit (or some NPC) consists of 9 models, they will all be in one folder. 

Warning: it will create a lot of duplicates, because naturally some models are shared between many outfits/npcs.

With "all" option, all materials will be put into ONE common folder called "materials".
With "alltxt" option, materials will be put into separate subfolder for each model set, and this will increase output size tremendously, because of even more duplicates.

2. Patch support

To support patches, new INI file is needed - rpkg_patch.ini
You can regulate what to extract by deleting lines in these files.
For example, if you delete ALL files in rpkg.ini - it will only extract patches and so on.

3. Static objects support

Most static objects will be extracted both with new "all" options, and old options where you can extract individual model or a list of models.

Hey daemon, did you look into getting the animation, the game has some pretty cool animations both crowd and player and object interaction that most game doesn't have. like dragging people, etc.

I know i bug you alot about animations. but i need animation from any game so i can create my own game in UE4. whether its quantum break or this game.

There seems to be a problem with some textures. Specifically the poison flasks (emetic, sedative and lethal) and the radio pickup where they show up like this:

Has there been any work to applying it to Hitman 2? It does not appear to work properly for the newer Glacier engine.

Here's the tool for Hitman 2018. Works the same as 2016.

I don't know what will work for season 1 from "both 2 seasons" pack, but one of the tools must work.

I don't know what will work for season 1 from "both 2 seasons" pack, but one of the tools must work.

The tool is giving this error. 

Unhandled Exception: System.FormatException: Additional non-parsable characters are at the end of the string.
   at System.ParseNumbers.StringToLong(String s, Int32 radix, Int32 flags, Int32* currPos)
   at System.Convert.ToUInt64(String value, Int32 fromBase)
   at Hitman6.Hitman6.Main(String[] args)

Is there a specific way to use it?

Not sure what you did wrong, basically you run cmd and then run the .exe from cmd from there.

Or you run cmd in that folder where you extracted the .exe and type in parameters such as "Hitman7 > list.txt" without the quotes of course. Make sure you also have the pkg.ini and rpkg.ini files alongside the exe just like the 2016 tool.

Yes i'm following the same technique. Actually i'm trying to convert TEXD files (they are .vap and .dat files).

This what i'm doing.

You'll need to download the Hitman6 utility as well, it includes some vital files you are missing.

My tool is not made to work with files extracted with someone else's tools.
It will NOT work.
My tool will extract all the models and textures directly from game packages.

Hi. Thanks for the tool, but as a noobie in this area, I can't seem to make the tool work. When I try to run the "hitman6.exe", it stays open for a couple of seconds and closes right after. The paths in the .ini files seems correct, but I can't find what may be going wrong. I've even dragged the exe to the cmd window to make sure it was running the right file. Could someone provide me with a more detailed procedure? Thanks

All tools by daemon1 are CMD tools for windows, you run them in CMD prompt, they will never work just by double clicking on it like a regular executable, basically make a new plain text file, in it write the commands mentioned above by daemon1 in bold text, and name it what you like from example.txt to example.cmd or example.bat, and then you double click that.

I'm using the Hitman7 tool along with the Hitman6 rpkg.ini and rpkg_patch.ini with the locations changed to my game folder. I open the hitman7.exe and it lists the hashes and stuff but when its done it just closes and doesnt create a list.txt, am I doing something wrong?

Thanks for your reply.
I do everything according to the instructions, using cmd created a list.txt file in it hash, size, number of materials, but as far as I understand, this list is only skeletal models. Next, I drop this file on Hitman6.exe and get models and textures, but, again, only skeletal, I never managed to find any objects in models or textures
I can't understand how to run this "to get all the models as a tree tree, run the Hitman6 alltxt" maybe that's where the static models are hidden, such as a sofa, a walls, a flower, etc.

Trying to use the asset tree method of extracting files, it works but there's over 2000 files it outputted and all are simple hashes. Does anyone have an easier way of identifying which ones are outfits worn by Hitman or something? I don't have time to go through so many files.

Has anyone managed to compile a list of assets such as playermodels only or a method of finding a specific playermodel? I'm looking for Knight from Hitman 2 co-op.

To double check, in Hitman 2 would the DLC numbers be the same? I wanna get the Colorado Militia outfits, so they'd be in dlc5.rpkg correct?

After trying every possible way to run the Hitman 3 exe, using cmd, powershell, whatever:

Unhandled Exception: System.IO.EndOfStreamException: Unable to read beyond the end of the stream.
   at System.IO.BinaryReader.FillBuffer(Int32 numBytes)
   at System.IO.BinaryReader.ReadUInt64()
   at Hitman6.Hitman6.Main(String[] args)

Using the command hitman3 > list.txt results in the same error and the program outputting an empty list.txt file to the same folder. The folder has both of the .ini files and the .py file included in the original download, and I've changed the filepaths in the .ini files to match the files I'm trying to access. How the hell does the program work?

Program works EXACTLY same as previous programs for hitman 1 & 2.
I have no reports on any errors yet.

Well there is this: [https://github.com/pawREP/Glacier-Prim-IO](https://github.com/pawREP/Glacier-Prim-IO)

It seems to have a list of models compiled by various people.

You need 3DS Max or Blender to import smd files, they both have plugins to import smd files.

I added a few batch files to make life a tiny bit easier!

How to Use 
Make sure you edit your "rpkg.ini" and "rpkg_patch.ini" files to match where your game files are!
if not the tool wont know where to extract from.
Thanks! 

You can get Hash codes by starting "[Bat0] New List.bat" and opening "Hash_List.txt" if the text file is empty then you didint edit your "ini" files correctly
once you have your "Hash_List.txt" you will be be given a list of numbers and letters

Example: 
   Hash Number      Size of Model      Number of Materials 
  5532EE9AC6F673        58368                  3 

The more number of Materials more than likely means its a character model

Just copy a Hash and Open "[Bat2] Extract Specific.Bat" and paste it in hit enter and in a few seconds
your Model(ASCII,SMD), Textures(DDS,TGA) and Hash Number just incase you forgot with Be in the "Export" Folder!

New tool version that supports Hitman 3 (2021)

Hitman 3 tool is outdated. Gives errors (such as "unable to read beyond the end of the stream") with most of packages. Been able to unpack only a few packages which haven't been altered with past year's patches. 
Hitman 2016 (Hitman 6) tool - works fine.
Hitman 2 2018 (Hitman 7) tool - works fine aswell.

You are one toxic fella aren't you? you see, that's YOUR problem what YOU want. If you want daemon1 to drop every project they are busy on just for you - ask them if they'll do a paid comission just for you, if they do commisions at all. If YOU didn't noticed everything and basically every author here makes tools out of curiocity and they make those tools mostly on full enthusiasm.
In the other hand questions asked by shitters such as you alike "Where the hell is that" - demotivates people completely.
Don't be a prick. Either politely ask or contribute or just bug off.
