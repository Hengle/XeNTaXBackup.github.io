Hi,

Until now I did not know that there is a tool like "Dragon Unpacker".
However its "File-ripper" is really slow and it only unpacks files(as far as I can see). Your MultiEx is great and it is able to add files to some "container files".

Well in future more formats should have "add-files"-support too. 

For example: all files that are listed and described on the mentioned page in the last message would and should have "add-file" support.

Well in future it should be possible to set the order of files in a "container file" via drag'n'drop too.

Yep. Back in the day, when MultiEx Commander was still a DOS tool, I wrote MEXSCAN, that would search files for ID-tags of other files (E.g. "RIFF" is a ID-tag of WAV files for instance, among others). That's basically how a file-ripper works, scan for ID-tags and rip them when found. I though about adding such a feature in MultiEx Commander, but decided not to do that. It would not really add anything, there are better programs that do that, and MultiEx Commander is focusing on replacement of files as well as extract. I hope to add more and more support for import/add etc.

Well I want not to help the team of "Dragon unpacker".

> "Until now I did not know that there is a tool like "Dragon Unpacker".
...is not really true.
I still remember that I send them file specs about "*.res->enoid, xatax..." and they did not answer and they did not thank.

After this time point I hate them and I will hate them in future too.

Well did you allready read my posts about "unknown compressions"? Could you try to use you great "reverse-engineering"-skill and knowledges to figure out the compressions, pleeeeeeeaaaaaase? 
(I allready tried google, without succes)
