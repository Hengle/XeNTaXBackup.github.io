I see there's already a topic about it, but for some reason my version of the game have all the Data files separated. However they are compressed, so I write a little tool that can crawl (also recursively) a given folder and decompress the files.
It can also compress them back to their original state.

The download link can be found on my site - [http://nullsecurity.org](http://nullsecurity.org) under the "game tools" section.
