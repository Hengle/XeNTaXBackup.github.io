I think there already exists a thread about Ragnarok, don't know if it was Ragnarok 2 though.
Their files are encrypted, I once tried to crack it but the exe was protected.

Yes, there is a old thread about Ragnarok 2.

The files are standard UE2(ver 1.29) apart from the headers were encrypted.
Here is the old thread: [viewtopic.php?t=2662](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?t=2662)

I didn't have any tools for that. I use winhex and looking for the import/export tables by my eyes! (Since I spend lot of time in UE2 in the past so I understand the tables format, that all, not secret!)
