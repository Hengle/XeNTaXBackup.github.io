- Post Title: FFXI modding trouble

Hello~
I'm quite a newb, I'm trying to follow some simple guide on recoloring for final fantasy xi online.

1) Open the .dat in ChangeTex
2) Extract the texture as a .dds
3) Open the texture .dds file in Photoshop
4) Do your coloring thing
5) Save as the same format (.dds)
6) Import the new texture .dds in ChangeTex

I need to mention this is a 2d file, using the same process with other files works but not on these UI/menu elements.
Seems simple but after I import the edited .dds and place the .dat file in the right folder its like nothing happened :s
I used ChangeTex to swap some cursor files I know it should work, 
I think it might be the way I'm editing or saving in photoshop that messes things up...


I also have Noesis 4-17 I can export to .dds but was wondering how to repack the dds files back into .dat.
Do I need some extra files for Noesis to work better with ffxi?

 Thank you in advance~
