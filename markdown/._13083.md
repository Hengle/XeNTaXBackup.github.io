the tool doesn't use a header, just the format.
Creating headers will be the next feature.
If you have any BC7 UN dds you could try copy and paste its header
and adjust width and height values.

thanks shakotay.
I don`t have a working dds file in BC7 UN format. And I can`t really find anything on the net that would generate one either.

I'm too busy with other coding atm than to solve this but I guess it should use a DX11 dds header.

Maybe search for "BC7" in this forum, too.

gregkwaste's dds in his post as of Sat Sep 13, 2014 is BC5 compressed:

width, height to be adjusted!

From what I know it uses a DX10 header: [https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/librar ... 85%29.aspx](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/bb943983%28v=vs.85%29.aspx)

(Maybe this leads you to your final solution?)

You might be able to use one of these to convert a texture to bc7 dds and copy the header.

thx. Seems to work - I used texconv, forcing a dx10 header:
(texconv -w 1760 -h 972 -f BC7_UNORM -dx10 textmaker_Noe.png)
