Hi mate, 

Yes, I havn't finished that script yet - all the *.asr files are different. The plugin in the last update only does the language files - someone wanted to do a translation of the game. I have the file that you attached, and have analysed it - I will put the support for it in the next version.

I know this is a very very old topic, but I just signed up, and was searching for some help on ripping this game, so if anyone is still around help would be nice.
