Does anyone have any idea what compression/encryption may be in use on the PC version of FF12 TZA?

The Nintendo Switch version of the game has no save-file encryption but it is using zlib compression. The PC version does not appear to be using zlib or it may also be using some obfuscation on-top of compression for the save files.

My goal is to be able to transfer a PC save-file to the Switch and vice versa. I can provide a sample save file upon request.

Thanks!
