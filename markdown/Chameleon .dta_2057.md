Hello everybody, I realy need some help with the .dta files from this game, the files are similar with Mafia or hidden & dangeros 2, but   I have read the other topics with .dta but I`m realy a noob with coding deconding in c+ or other stuff like that, so if somebody has an ideea and can help me, and btw my fisrt ideea was to use the MafiaDataXtractor but i need the rw_data.dll from mafia to overwrite rw_data of Chameleon and I`m not very sure if this will realy work.

Did you try that .dta extractor for mafia?
It is the same game engine in H&D2, mafia, chameleon

check this topic:

I used the mafia extractor but it didn`t work (the rw_data its not compatible so I think thats why it doesn`t work) and with H&D2 I tried but still no luck

Hmmm, you are right.
I looked at file structure and it looks similiar, but its improved version of LS3D Engine, that was used in Mafia
Maybe MassaSnygga could write some unpacker too?

btw: Chameleon is Slovak game (I am from Slovakia too), so I am interested in dta files to make some mods...
