- Post Title: Tales of Destiny 2 (PSX) wierd font format

Hi! (sorry for my english)
I'm going to translate game to russian. I unpacked archives, create texteditor, find font for menu, but font for ingame dialogues quite strange.
This is part of font [https://mega.co.nz/#!RJtwhKAT!ZRE7PJsUB ... Mjg7MzAQeg](https://mega.co.nz/#!RJtwhKAT!ZRE7PJsUBBGq1pkUDzK_8HQOAtY_Ps2S5Mjg7MzAQeg)
It has letters from "D"  to "Z" (I learned it by comparing to other language version of the game). Looking at the size of data (500 bytes), it is 2bit image (each letter 8x12)
it is a font  (game screenshot)
Somebody can help to understand a format of font data?
