- Post Title: Tekken Tag Tournament 2 Audio Files [Request]

I am having trouble figuring how to rip the audio files from Tekken Tag Tournament 2 for the Xbox 360. I have the game decompiled on my computer with the various bin files. I already know how to rip the models; however, I have no idea how to find the sounds. I mainly would like the character voices including, but not limited to pre-fight quotes, attack sounds, hurt sounds, KO sounds, and victory sounds. I know that it is possible to rip sounds from Xbox 360 games since Dead or Alive 4 and Street Fighter X Tekken sounds have already been ripped and converted. I really don't want the music since I can download the OST, but it wouldn't hurt much to have the ripped version. All I want to know is if I can get the files using a similar process as with getting the models and textures.

Thanks,
