- Post Title: EA Games Font Files (*.FFN)

I was unpacking .far and .iff files of The Sims Complete Collection in order to change the localization of the game, hoping it would support Cyrillic considering it has Russian slot which isn't used. Unfortunately, it doesn't support it. After some searching, I found an unofficial Russian patch for the game. I compared the two installations in order to find out which files are different, and I realized the .FFN font files inside "UIGraphics.far" package are modified. Considering my native language has some additional Cyrillic characters which aren't present in Russian, I would need your help with editing the .FFN fonts. I attached the original .FFN files and the ones from the Russian patch, hoping it would be easier for you to analyze them. These files are used in many EA Games, according to Google, hence the title.

Thank you in advance!

Good job! Can you share a script for decompressing/reimporting the files?

Cool, original font. It's you that's enough from a file? If Yes, then as now the figure back to shove?
