- Post Title: Arena Breakout Mobile - Texture Editing

Hello , I'm trying to change a texture of "ARENA BREAKOUT MOBILE" . The game uses Unreal engine 4.26 and texture format is ASTC . I've tried to inject a texture to main texture of the game using UE4-DDS-TOOLS & it injected successfully. But the format of the texture has been changed to PF xxxxx format. Then I have made a pak file using unrealpak tool and named it pakchunk-1-xxxxx-ASTC_P.pak(because Unreal Engine reads the _P files first) .But it didn't work. Also the main game file is encrypted but I didn't encrypted the pak file.
Can anyone tell me what's the reason that the mod didn't work?
