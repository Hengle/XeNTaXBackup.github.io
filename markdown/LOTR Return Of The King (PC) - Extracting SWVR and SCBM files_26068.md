- Post Title: LOTR Return Of The King (PC) - Extracting SWVR and SCBM files

Does anyone have any ideas on how to extract the files in the SWVR file format?
 Theres also a folder "player" with allot more files, two of which I know are audio files: bnk and samp, the rest however I don't know how to extract them or really know what they do. I think the models are in the SCBM folder but I also couldn't find anything about it. I really want to figure out how to extract the models and textures.

Can you upload few samples of SWVR and SCBM files to some hosting site like mega.nz, google drive etc and then share a public link here?
Can you upload main archive as well?

Also, what platform is this game for? PS2, XBOX, PC?
