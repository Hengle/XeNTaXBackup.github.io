Firstly, if you want to contact Luigi directly, he doesn't respond here anymore from what I saw.
He has his own forum at [https://zenhax.com/](https://zenhax.com/)

And secondly, try Noesis to extract any Unreal game that you have no script, I too extracted few months back Tekken 7 PS4 version and I used Noesis to do it.

I personally never had issues dumping both PC and PS4 versions of the game, and since I no longer have the PS4 files I have no clue why wont work for you.
