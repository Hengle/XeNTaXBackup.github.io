- Post Title: .lin / .sav from Double Agent PS2/Xbox?

I am looking to extract Unreal data from Splinter Cell Double Agent on PS2/Xbox 1. I was able to extract data from the .UMD format (used on Splinter Cell Chaos Theory PC/XBOX and Double Agent Xbox/PS2) but instead of getting Unreal files, I got .lin/sav files from the PS2 and .lin/.dlf files from the Xbox version.
It looks as though the .sav files from PS2 are actual savegame files (perhaps the spawning save?) as there are Unreal headers a fey bytes into the files, but the Unreal file does not start at the first byte. Also, the .sav file is rather small (about 350kb each time) where as the .lin file seems to hold the meat of the data.

Does anyone have any idea on the file format? Is this similar to the Linear Localization system used for Double Agent on PC?

If anyone can help with - would be awesome! The purpose is to attempt to recreate the Old Gen Splinter Cell experience for PC!

I can send a sample menu.lin/dlf (xbox) and  .lin/.sav from PS2 if it is allowed and someone would like me to.

Thanks!!!

At first sight xbox .lin files are compressed (789C header) but PS2 .lin file probably not.
