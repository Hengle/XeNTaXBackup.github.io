- Post Title: Ipod Game .ARM files

Hey all. I've been tinkering around with this blasted file for a long time now but other than extracting into a bunch of extensionless files via 7zip, there's no real way for me to open it. I'm looking for graphics as per usual.[http://www.sendspace.com/file/yt9dup](http://www.sendspace.com/file/yt9dup)
As far as I know this is a fairly common file format in iPod games...I've seen it a few times...so if we figure this out we'll have another one free!
