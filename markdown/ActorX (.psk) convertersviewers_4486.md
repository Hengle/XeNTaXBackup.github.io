- Post Title: ActorX (.psk) converters/viewers?

(posting in the right forum this time...)

Hey,

Is anyone aware of any open source programs to convert .psk files to other 3D formats?  Or does anyone know of any open source viewers/libraries for displaying the mesh and their textures?

Thanks!

Actor X Importer is a script, that means it is open source
