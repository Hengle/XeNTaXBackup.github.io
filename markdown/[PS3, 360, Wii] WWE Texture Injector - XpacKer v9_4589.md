This is what I got messing around with X-Packer and WWF SD!2



I used the ED1L Pac file (loaded under texture archive) I have no idea what to do about the encryption and how to extract the actual textures from the encrypted files.

V4.0 has been released. It now supports wii and xbox 360 pac files. 

@NMCM, I cantsee the pic you've posted. I've posted tutorials on my site on how to work with the different types of data contained in the pac files. I havent tried WWF SD!2, it's way too old
