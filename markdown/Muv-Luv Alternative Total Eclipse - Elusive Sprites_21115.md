- Post Title: Muv-Luv Alternative: Total Eclipse - Elusive Sprites

So this is a bit of a tricky situation. I've been using RioX to try and get character sprites from some of the Muv-Luv games, and has worked up until I tried Total Eclipse. The CGs and script files were ripped, but the character sprites are not being ripped at all. Some have suggested that they've been encoded differently.

For some background, the Muv-Luv games use rUPG as its engine, which is known for being one of the most difficult to work with engines. All files are encoded under .rio files, so its also the engine's graphic file format. Tools are hard to find as well outside of RioX, though some names that have been dropped are Westside's tools and riodecode, neither of which I've been able to find a working link to.

Any help would be appreciated. Thank you to those who took the time to read this.
