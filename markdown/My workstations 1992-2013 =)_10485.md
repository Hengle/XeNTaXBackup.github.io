I notice a certain tendency of increasing untidyness peaking at 2002 and then drastically declining. Must be age and responsibility finally kicking in after those frantic university years. Took me a while though. Or in smiley terms:

1992 -   
1993 -   
1995 -   
1996 -   
1997 -   
1998 -   
1999 -   
2002 -   
2005 -   
2008 -   
2013 -

1998 was a good year I see XD.

Very nice piece of history.
