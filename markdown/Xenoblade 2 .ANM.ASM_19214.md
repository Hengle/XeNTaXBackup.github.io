Pretty sure this is an animation format.

Mesh for Mythra:

Should be rigged. May have issues in Blender.

Extracted .MOT for her. Includes ANM files and one ASM file.

Ideally it would be nice to convert the animations to something like SMD or FBX.

I know Some1fromthedark will be start working on these formats after he managed to convert the high poly Kingdom Heart models and later the Kingdom Hearts animation format.

BlockBuilder57 is slowly working on a .ANM to .FBX/.SMD format now, I won't have to take Some1fromthedark to work on this format.
