- Post Title: Star Wars Battlefront 2 (2017) - How to extract files?

Hello everyone!
I am trying to extract files from new SWBF II (it is now in Trial), but unfortunately extraction tools for SWBF 2015 ([https://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=33&t=13145](https://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=33&t=13145)) aren't working. I am especially looking for localization files.

Could anyone look at it?

You can download the game files there (it is with first cas file in each folder only):

Thank you very much!

The game has changed since the beta and has ZSTD compression on it's cat/cas files but Python won't support that by default so you need a wrapper for it which you can find here [https://github.com/sergey-dryabzhinsky/python-zstd](https://github.com/sergey-dryabzhinsky/python-zstd) and [https://github.com/facebook/zstd/releas ... -win32.zip](https://github.com/facebook/zstd/releases/download/v1.3.2/zstd-v1.3.2-win32.zip)

Not sure how to apply these but i thought i'd post them for anyone wanting to try and edit the script to support the game. 

Oh you can find the script here. [https://bitbucket.org/Frankelstner/fros ... tlefront-2](https://bitbucket.org/Frankelstner/frostbite-battlefront-2)

Unfortunately I don't know how to use the script. 
It gives me this error:

I've only edited this: [https://pastebin.com/R3cscWiz](https://pastebin.com/R3cscWiz) in the script.

It won't work because it's still calling for LZ4 decompression with the LZ77 DLL, it needs ZSTD decompression so you will have to figure out a way to edit the rest of the script before it works.

Ever find anything out? I've been struggling to get it to work. I've been all over the web trying to find a solid ZSTD.dll file and supporting files to work.

There's a ZSTD dll from Aluigi that's compiled from the current (9th October 2017) source of zstd, that contains legacy algorithms available [http://aluigi.org/bms/zstd.dll](http://aluigi.org/bms/zstd.dll)

I haven't been able to get the scripts to work though, they go through all the files, creating folders but no actual files are dumped. Anyone else had any luck?

Nice! Let me know if you get this working. I'm personally only looking for the audio, I'll keep trying.
