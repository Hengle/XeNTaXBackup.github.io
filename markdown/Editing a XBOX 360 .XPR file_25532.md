- Post Title: Editing a XBOX 360 .XPR file

Hello. The game I’m using is NCAA Football ‘14.

I have a .XPR file that I would like to edit using Photoshop.

In order to get the file to work in Photoshop, do I need to use Unbundler and then one of the .TGA files or the .RDF file that spits out? Or do I need to change the file extension to something else using Noeisis? 

What might also help me is the fact that I have a version edited of the file I want, but it’s in .DDS format for PS3. Is there a way I can convert that file to use for XBOX 360?

Please advise.
