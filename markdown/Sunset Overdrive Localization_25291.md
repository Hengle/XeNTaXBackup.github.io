- Post Title: Sunset Overdrive Localization

As I love this game, I tried to look for any mods localized in Korean, I found someone who tried it, but it seems the project is abandoned.

Link below is the announcement for the localizing from "Team Freestyle".

Seeing the post, It seems they could change the subtitles and other stuffs.
So I tried to contact, but it seems the manager of the team has disappeared due to the personal reason.

So, I tried to make the mod, but the problem is that I don't know much about modding.
The only thing I found is the post below, and that "g05s000" file is the language and font file.

I tried to unpack the file using LZ4, but only an empty file appears.

Is there anyone who can help me?

Did you find anything? I installed 3DS Max to run script. But it seems doesn't work with localization files. 

Then I tried to find with binary and found it but couldn't separate the file.
