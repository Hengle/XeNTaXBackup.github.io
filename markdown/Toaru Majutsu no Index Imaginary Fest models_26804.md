Hello,i need help to decrypting files and getting character models from Toaru Majutsu no Index: Imaginary fest

im also find other way to decrypting files: use VGMtoolbox "advanced cutter/offset findler", and write in "Search String" 556E6974794653,(also ✔ Trear as Hex), and write same in "use terminator string", search string is it offset im use 0x00, (you can use .assetbundle format or other, anyway AssetStudio open it), (also you can ✔ "cut to eof when terminator not found" but i dont know what it do), you can export other models... but mainly its models random weapons and effect, not characters. And its not all weapons and effects. This is what I found by accident. I don't even understand how it works =). I am absolutely not versed in programming, just something similar was used for a different game with UnityFS. Although, I suppose, not everything files in imaginary fest is encrypted on UnityFS.
My method does not decrypt models that are decrypted .bms files from past dialogues about this game. But it is also impossible to decipher these models what possible get with my method, if using .bms method. Simply put, these two methods decrypt completely different files.
I also noticed that in different versions of the game - different models are encrypted. I didn't find some of the models that were in the old game cache right now, but I also found a couple of those that appeared recently. I would like to somehow get the very first versions of the game cache.
I hope the path I accidentally found will help decipher all the models, because there are a lot of amazing people who understand programming, while I absolutely do not understand programming. I'm just a little lucky in random actions. ^-^

It is a long but actually regularity xor. I already have an answer to this but will not share anything at the earliest as I am sick of so many trolls.
Hopefully someone will emerge who is more knowledgeable and will be able to solve this problem in a smarter way. Because even though I know the answer, my method is not very smart...

There are five or six different tables as patterns. I checked this around 2021, so it is possible that there are more or even different methods today.
The game has been increasing different encryptions over time.

Not sure about what you're talking about Trolls (I'm not aware of the situation, sorry), but still, I'd be interested to know your method, and what models possible can get with your method, even if you write it PM me. I think this is in any case smarter than what I did - I literally accidentally found a method, without even understanding programming.
Even if not in the near future, I hope a good decryption method will be found or created.
