- Post Title: (Wii U/3DS) Monster Hunter 3 Ultimate .quest files

Hi there xentax,

recently the free DLC quests of Capcoms Monster Hunter 3 Ultimate have been dumped. Was looking forward to create custom quests on their basis, but of course they're somehow encrypted... maybe sb can help out with this case 

Also, the text files containing description for the next weeks DLC  etc. are also encrypted. Probably they share the same encryption.

Some info that might help:
- encryption presumably works on 8 byte block basis
- the last 4 bytes always contain the file size 

Please take a look, I attached some quests + text files.
