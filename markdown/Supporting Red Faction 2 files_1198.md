I hope in the next release will support Red Faction 2 files

They are in the formats: *.CSC, *.rfa, *.rfc, *.rfe, *.rfm, *.peg

I also have those files in my computer as I have the game installed.
If you need the files for analyze, just let me know...

Yes, please. We would need them to take a look at it!
