So, I guess no one want to do it? Or is it because it's from the demo?

Would love a script for this as well

I see Sonic is using Havok. There is a 3dsmax script for DAW here [http://forums.relicnews.com/showthread.php?244744](http://forums.relicnews.com/showthread.php?244744). Would it be possible to edit it, to match sonic ?

Yeah they gave credit. To all the people that worked on it including Chrrox. Pretty awesome I must say though.

Originally they released it on Sonic Retro for people to mess around with I guess.

Seeing that a lot of people are wanting to mod Sonic Generations anyways. Pretty awesome stuff.
