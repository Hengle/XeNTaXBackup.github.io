- Post Title: Encrypted UMOD (Unreal Engine)

Hi Guys! Wanted to reach out to all the talent out there to speed things up.
I have a file that is encrypted with what appears to be some sort of simple encryption method.

Can someone take a look as see if they can figure out what method? The end result should be an Unreal UMOD file ( I hope)

Thanks in advanced for any and all help!
