Reminds me of when I manually copied and pasted the vertex data into Excel, using cheat engine, when running the game on the EPSXE emulator (this was in 2009). The thing is, if I recall correctly, the format of the models that are on the disc, are stored in a strange way, But when the game loads them into memory they are converted, into a very different but still slightly strange format. I have not seen either the raw file format nor the in memory format used in any other PS1 games.
Bloody Roar 3 for the PS2 also does something similar (and strangely enough on some emulators, both games freeze when you reach some menus, but when you do a soft-reset the game will then go past the menus without difficulties.
I just might be able to make a script to get the character models from the savestates, and then use that information to make a script for the raw files.
