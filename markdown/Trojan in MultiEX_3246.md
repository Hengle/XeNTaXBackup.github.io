- Post Title: Trojan in MultiEX?

What's up with this?

================================
Risk name:	     Trojan-PSW.Win32.LdPinch.bgj
Source:	     Scanner
Risk level:	     High
Risk category: Trojan

Advice: This is a high risk and should be removed immediately as it may compromise your privacy and security, make dangerous changes to your computer's settings without your knowledge and consent, or severely degrade your computer's performance and stability.


jaederstorm.exe
jn.exe


Name: Trojan-PSW.Win32.LdPinch.bgj

Type: Malware

Type Description: Malware ("malicious software") consists of software with clearly malicious, hostile, or harmful functionality or behavior and that is used to compromise and endanger individual PCs as well as entire networks.

Category: Trojan

Category Description: Trojan is a general term for malicious software that is installed under false or deceptive pretenses or is installed without the user's full knowledge and consent. Most Trojans exhibit some form of malicious, hostile, or harmful functionality or behavior.

Level: High

Level Description: High risks are typically installed without user interaction through security exploits, and can severely compromise system security. Such risks may open illicit network connections, use polymorphic tactics to self-mutate, disable security software, modify system files, and install additional malware. These risks may also collect and transmit personally identifiable information (PII) without your consent and severely degrade the performance and stability of your computer.

Advice Type: Remove

Don't be too suspicious about that. Be aware: such called "Anti-Virus"-programs are mainly designed to protect commercial software and the possibilities to change or to alter it - but NOT TO PROTECT YOU and your computer. The corporation which has programmed the "Anti-Virus"-software is probably involved with the creator of a program which has altered with MULTIEX and earns money with the creator.
Although I am not affiliated with MULTIEX, I don't think it is as dangerous as your "Anti-Virus"-program says.
Deinstall your "Anti-Virus"-malware and use another browser, e.g. Opera.

Used many many times and never any sign of trojan.

you've got it from a safe location?

If this site isn't safe, then what is?

This site IS save. I implemented the latest version of Strobe's JaederNaub, and I have absolutely no reason to believe he uploaded a Trojan version.

You should perhaps check the file with other scanners.

its actually quite disheartening to see how stupid most of the AVs on the market are...
oh well, what can you expect from a bunch of 0s and 1s...

It is only a matter of time until my Little Extractor Program (GOBREAD) will also become a "potential risk to your computer".
On the net I have seen many others people programs put on a black list.
The reason: Commercial game companies and their lawyers don't want their data to be explored and pay "Anti-Virus"-software-companies to try to rattle the users.

I'm not overly concerned about it. I just wanted to show you guys what CounterSpy v3 says about the program.

See this? Maybe it is packed with an executable compressor or even protector.
Modern malware uses them to hide their code from Antivirus programs.
Thus some apps cry wolf if they encounter a packed exe.

You guys are all looking at the wrong thing here. Most modern antivirus programs use heuristics to detect threats that haven't otherwise been discovered and protected against. One of the behaviors commonly checked for by these heuristics is deep-scanning and ripping behavior - exactly what JN does. It's not a problem with Strobe's ripper, and it's not a conspiracy between AV software developers and commercial software publishers, it's got to do with the heuristics used by the AV programs, and is likely an unfixable issue.

well whatever, just tell your antivirus not to treat it as a threat anymore, if it has that option...
if it doesn't then i really recommend getting rid of it ASAP

Just searching for the definition of heuristics I found this which is just all the more satisfying to this conversation lol:
 
> Heuristic (pronounced /hjʊˈrɪstɨk/, from the Greek "Εὑρίσκω" for "find" or "discover") is an adjective for experience-based techniques that help in problem solving, learning and discovery. A heuristic method is particularly used to rapidly come to a solution that is hoped to be close to the best possible answer, or 'optimal solution'. Heuristics are "rules of thumb", educated guesses, intuitive judgments or simply common sense. A heuristic is a general way of solving a problem. Heuristics as a noun is another name for heuristic methods.

Gotta' love what I highlighted in bold.  Now apply that to the way all these AV/AS programs are designed and you have your answer why they are finding "problems" with some of these extraction programs...

report it as a false alert, takes a little time for the AV Company to check and confirm it but once it has they fix it.

I just downloaded MultiEx Commander 4.3.1 from [blog/?attachment_id=72](http://forum.xentax.com/blog/?attachment_id=72) and Norton 2010 says that it contained "Trojan.ADH".

[http://www.symantec.com/security_respon ... 99&tabid=2](http://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2010-031221-0802-99&tabid=2)
"...If one or more files on your computer have been classified as having a Trojan.ADH threat, this indicates that the files have suspicious characteristics and therefore might contain a new or unknown threat. However, given the sensitive nature of this detection technology, it may occasionally identify non-malicious, legitimate software programs that also share these behavioral characteristics..."

Now, I have been reading in this thread about how there are still problems with Anti-V and their detection methods, however Norton says that it 'cleaned' the file. So now I am curious what piece of code has been erased from the file which Norton thought was malicious?

And I have also wondered from time to time, if a file is encrypted, how can an anti-v go in and still remove code? What is the purpose of encrypting your files if anyone can still access them?

That would be Jaeder Naub that has been deleted. In version 4.3.1 or earlier that is.
