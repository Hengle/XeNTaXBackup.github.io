- Post Title: Splinter Cell Blacklist Archive Reversing

Is nobody working on extracting resources from SCBL, 3D models / Textures.
.usx .utx are thse files split into chunks across

.umd
.ass
.asstrm

I noticed that of all the umd's

PEC-ADV.umd
PEC-Main.umd

The above files are not compressed like the others they have .SC6 instead of EPCK why is that?
