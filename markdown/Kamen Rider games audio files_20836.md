So here's a sample of what I believe to be Genm's voices from KRCW, it's in a .audio file that I have no idea how to make sense of. Anyone knows how to decrypt this?

They're Ogg Vorbis files.  I just renamed them to *.ogg and they seemed to play ok.

I've never dealt with .ogg before, only .wav

How do I play it?

Any audio player should play it - such as Foobar, Winamp, among others.

Thank you. Do you know where I can find the actual voice files? Since all I got were belt voices and not character voices.

Also can you make sense of this attachment? It's from Kamen Rider Super Climax Heroes PSP version.

EDIT: Forgot that there were attachment file size limit

Hi, I don't have the games so I don't know where the voice files are, unfortunately.

That last attachment is an archive of 34 CRI .adx files - if you have VGMToolbox, that will extract them, and they will also play with Foobar/Vgmstream.

Do I need to extract them with VGMToolbox first? Or rename the extension? Cuz I tried loading it into foobar but it didn't work. Or am I missing a plugin?

Sorry, yes.  Extract them with VGMToolbox first using the CRI ADX Extractor option.  The extracted .adx files will play in Foobar with vgmstream.

Thank you.
So I spent a few hours doing nothing but testing every single voice archive in Kamen Rider City War to find the voices. Apparently they don't label the voice archives by ID, no, that's only for the belts of each particular form.

I had to spend a number of hours testing each and every single voice archive to find out which belongs to which. There were duplicates, and some I just plain can't identify.

I had to test each and every one of the 94 voice archives. The first archive which is for Kamen Rider Ichigou is named audios_voice2_charabase_CB00001_1.zip  Which means they were probably labelled by the order they put in the characters and voices.

Here's the list of IDs I was able to identify


EDIT: On another note, has anyone been able to rip the voices of Kamen Rider Battride War Genesis?

EDIT2:[Here's a folder with the archives with the .audio files for the character voices in Kamen Rider City War.](http://www.mediafire.com/folder/ntwm2ijkj7i7x/Kamen_Rider_City_Wars)

I need help, none of the audio files are working. I'm only used to mp3 and wav. I tried to download Drive's files but I can't seem to hear it. I'm using a iPhone by the way. Is there a solution to this?
