- Post Title: Street Wars .fil archives

All game data is stored in fil archives.
I uploaded some of the sfx ones here: [http://uploaded.de/?id=k1p5hw](http://uploaded.de/?id=k1p5hw)
The first byte in the file seems to indicate which data it holds.
A demo can be downloaded here: [http://downloads.gamezone.com/demos/d1749.htm](http://downloads.gamezone.com/demos/d1749.htm)

Any help is appreciated. 

Edit: Uploaded the rest here: [http://uploaded.de/?id=3l189s](http://uploaded.de/?id=3l189s)
