Could a Moderator/Administrator move this to: [viewforum.php?f=21](http://forum.xentax.com/viewforum.php?f=21)

The problem is the compression-algorithmus of cas files.........

No, this is the correct sub-forum until it's confirmed the compression algorithm is unknown. Due to lack of evidence it cannot be confirmed.

Cheers.

I've uploaded some files as example (luigi did post a chunk file aswell in his thread, link below) : 
[http://eep.fifaplanet.eu/download/?dir= ... ad_FIFA17/](http://eep.fifaplanet.eu/download/?dir=GreyDynamics_Upload_FIFA17/)   (toc, sb)
[http://eep.fifaplanet.eu/download/?dir= ... package_00](http://eep.fifaplanet.eu/download/?dir=GreyDynamics_Upload_FIFA17/fifa_installpackage_00) (cat,cas)

I think luigi is a good source for confirming it too.

It was confirmed that the compression algorithm in use is a legacy version of zstd. [http://www.zstd.net](http://www.zstd.net)
