Hi! I am searching for people who can extract 3d models and animations from Chrono Cross. I found some describes of file structure of the game. Can you help?
I found a link where is few models and cpp codes. Also there is some skripts for blender.  So, from there I found all player caracters models and some their animations for blender (I dont know how to export them to 3ds maxor something else). Also I have almost every model of monsters without animations. I have some files at0 format wich are locatet in animations folder, but I don.t know how import them to models. I stil need some boses models: Aquator and Anemotor.
Here is the links with files what I found:

If you got models and animations on Blender, all you have to do is export them in FBX.
3ds Max or Maya will open FBX files just fine, give it a try.

Firts of all - models what I found I am not searching . I am searching another models, what I not found. Also I not find a 3d models of battlefields at all!. Another thing that there is animations not for all models, so I need animations too. 
In the links you can find all what I found.

how boring! Better close this thread.  It's useless.
Feel like someone is talking who's disappointed that noone in this forum helped him out and now hides his knowledge as kinda revenge.
Is this "the message" Mr.Mouse spoke of?

Maybe I'm wrong - then prove it.

just said, that it is hard  to explain to me in English) In few words you have to rotate camera om blender in the same position like it must to be in the game if it was a 3d location. and then you are recreating all models from the image.

So its basically a camera mapping technique to reconstruct a 3d model from a 2d image.

Wait, what? You are recreating the levels by hand? You do not use actual models from the game ?

Right you are.  I don't know the game, so I understand that the worlds in the game are sprites in a pre-rendered 2d background ?

Yes, the backgrounds are prerendered 2D pictures,  only characters have a 3D models. The same was in FF7

Speaking of fields (or locations), yes, they use pre-rendered backgrounds, plus, as far as I understand it, an invisible 3d canvas as a bounding box, some pre-rendered tiled graphics for overlapping level parts (like, let's say, fences, that hide player characters, when they're behind it) and small FMVs for animated level parts (like, for example, waving flags). Battlefields and characters, on the other hand, are 3d models.

OP, why are You remodelling levels? Are You trying to do a remake? If so, I warn You, that Square Enix tremulously guard their games, even really old games. Chrono Resurrection, a game, that supposed to be a free tech demo and a proof of skills, is a good example of their politics.
