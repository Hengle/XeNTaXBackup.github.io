- Post Title: Planetside

I am currently working on decoding the file format for the various packages that Planetside uses. There are a few file extensions, including .PAK, .UBR, .FDX, .FAT, among others. I just registered MultiEx Commander in attempts to try to use custom BMS scripts to extract these files, and any help is GREATLY appriciated. Anyone interested in helping me can contact me at [oneshoturdone@gmail.com](mailto:oneshoturdone@gmail.com) or on AIM at oneshoturdone. Or just leave a reply here. Thanks! 

The game is now free, and can be found at [http://planetside.station.sony.com/reserves/](http://planetside.station.sony.com/reserves/)

Here is a sample of one of the files I am trying to unpack. I belive there are DDS textures being held in here.
