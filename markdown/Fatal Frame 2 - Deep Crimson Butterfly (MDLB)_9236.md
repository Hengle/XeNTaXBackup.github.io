- Post Title: Fatal Frame 2 - Deep Crimson Butterfly (MDLB)?

I've been looking through the files I think the model files are .MDLB The game is for the wii.
But I also see .PPDB which I'm not sure what those are.

Does anyone know anything about the file types?
Id like to extract some of the models 

thanks in advance for any info and I can supply one of the files by PM if you need it.
