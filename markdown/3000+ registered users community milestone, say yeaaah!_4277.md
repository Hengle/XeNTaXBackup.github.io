Hey come on! This is *feel good* thread! You seem to forget that we all do this for free, and it is not always possible to spend time on this. We need to make a living elsewhere. Also, it may be possible no-one replies to your thread, because they have not figured out the format, or can't. Now, back to feeling good.

Oh come on Gocha. Don't be so grumpy. My request for a research of Waxworks is also without success. So what? I have a life beyond gaming and it goes on without this solution. So all I have to say is: Yeeeehaaaa from Germany!

It would be rather hard (but insanely cool) to get 100 million legitimate members here...
