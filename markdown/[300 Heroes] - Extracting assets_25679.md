- Post Title: [300 Heroes] - Extracting assets

There is an existing script to extract assets from the game, but the encryption has been updated, probably a different offset? Wondering if anyone has any knowledge, and can update the decryptor.

It uses QuickBMS, and the .jmp file works like a ZIP, but encrypted in some way.

Here is the .jmp (data file). There is 4 of them, but I attach one.

In attachments is the script, run it with QuickBMS, and use the 300HERO.bms file, or perhaps even 300HERO.txt.
