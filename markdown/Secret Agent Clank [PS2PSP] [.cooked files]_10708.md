- Post Title: Secret Agent Clank [PS2/PSP] [.cooked files]

Hello all, seeing the Gamescon videos for the new ratchet and clank sort of gave me the urge to revisit the old games and browse through their content in hopes of extracting 3D content.

Secret Agent Clank appears to be the only game I could find which has it's content stored in plain zip files so here are the extracted content which appear to be .cooked files I have tried looking at reversing however I can't seen to find a good way could someone assist?


Content Sample:

Example of one of the files open in hex editor


As you can see there are some references to texture files in there.

cra0,

Can you tell me where I can find the texture files?
(I did not find these files in the image.zip file.)

I uploaded the converted Qwark models in Wavefront .obj format.
