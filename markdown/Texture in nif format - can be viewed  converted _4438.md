- Post Title: Texture in "nif" format - can be viewed / converted ?

I have a few "nif" texture files from the free online game Wizard101. 
These nif-s only contains texture( not 3D model; witch is another nif).

Here is an example:
[http://www.megafileupload.com/en/file/2 ... t-nif.html](http://www.megafileupload.com/en/file/227836/street-nif.html)


My question is: there is a way to view/ convert these textures from nif format ?

Thanks for any help,

Lookup nifskope.  There is a great toolset out there for nifs.  I just checked and it opens this fine--right click the pixel data and choose export.
