- Post Title: Game client compilation

Lots of MMO's that are hidden behind login pages and stuff. Especially chinese/japanese/korean games that require you to sign up, which requires you to provide proof of citizenship as a simple way to filter out all the foreigners.

[http://wiki.xentax.com/index.php/Game_Clients](http://wiki.xentax.com/index.php/Game_Clients)

But most of the clients can still be accessed if you have the direct link, so of course it would be nice if we had a single place to put it.
Now go! Fill that page with client links!

Try to include things like game homepage, company name, and of course the client link. And whether the game is 2D/3D to make it more descriptive.
I say homepage because then someone might find other games that are of interest.

If a game is hosted by different companies (eg: global servers vs korean servers) err...we'll need a way to deal with that.

I would suggest indexing by the english name, and any variations in parenthesis, as well as links to different servers. Some people might have better speeds with one server over the other.

Filehosts? I don't know I guess it's ok.
