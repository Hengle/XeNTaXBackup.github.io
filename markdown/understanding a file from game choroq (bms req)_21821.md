- Post Title: understanding a file from game choroq (bms req)

Hi, I'm wondering if someone could help me with a BMS script with this file in question, from my understanding the file starts with 4 byte offsets then file size also 4 byte then padding 0. The file I think contains data of 3d model and texture, I can open texture probably with noesis script, model im not so sure. Either way here's the file: [https://mega.nz/#!dUVFmaxJ!cHdAonDTQgaM ... mSORdVbUhE](https://mega.nz/#!dUVFmaxJ!cHdAonDTQgaMunVrYxacYf2QcxsWHFe9bmSORdVbUhE)

thanks in advance

well, can't serve with a script but 3D data looks strange to me, would bet for animation data but not sure:

I've been able to see something, as I believe the first offset is for this 3d model: [https://imgur.com/a/xGXdRur](https://imgur.com/a/xGXdRur) 
and the second offset has something like this [https://imgur.com/a/MxgyQnq](https://imgur.com/a/MxgyQnq)

However I'm not being able to split or analyze the data from the 3 data offset onwards (even with your adjustion tips), im not sure how to split it, if someone can progress I would appreciate it
