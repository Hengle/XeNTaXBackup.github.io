- Post Title: Splitgate- UModel Help! "Bad allocation size"

Hello everyone! 

I saw some Splitgate models online and figured it was possible to rip from it. 
I'm using the latest october 4th update of Umodel, and basically tried everything on the program itself to try to get some player models out. 
Guns, jetpack, First person hands, textures, mannequin, even maps, extracted all fine. 

However, I'm needing the player models. Which are found in the 3rd person folder. As I want to do a halo vs split animation. 
I cannot get ANY of them to work. Which is a shame. The attached file is what I keep running into. 

Since I've seen a few models,  Is there a plug in or tool that could make the extract work? I understand valorant and some other games need special files to get them to work. Maybe a different program and method perhaps?

Any help or advice would be appreciated. Thanks!
