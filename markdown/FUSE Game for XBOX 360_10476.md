FUSE Game is out there.

Is there any possibility to extract textures and meshes etc.

I have not downloaded the game yet, but if anybody have interest, please reply.

I'll support this, I have the game and I could provide any samples. So if someone helps extract content from Fuse data packages it would be perfect, I'm planning to look at model format.

Yeah sure, I can upload samples. But, since Fuse content stored in big data archives I should cut them. 20-40 mb will be enough?

Ok, so here's sample of Fuse data.00 [http://www.mediafire.com/?y399ijkba3sce2z](http://www.mediafire.com/?y399ijkba3sce2z).
It's first 40 mb of the file. Hope it helps, if I did something not correct or more samples will be needed samples let me know.

Well, share some progress. Definitely I see textures and models inside Fuse data containers. As for textures I extracted few, but proper extractor will come in handy

Small update, I have some limited success with models. Here's part of Dalton's head, and his head UV's. Still I have some issues with the mesh itself, this format is so strange  I will upload new samples tomorrow, it would be so awesome if someone could help with proper file extraction.

Great progress buddy 

You are the only person who is interested in this game, and some how managed to extract texture and mesh.

I don't have programming knowledge, so really sorry buddy, I am unable to help you.
I am eagerly waiting for your release. Thank you very very much

Thanks for your interest OrangeC , sad that I have issues with meshes right now. Also, I have some news, I bought PS3 version of the game, and appears that large data containers there are not compressed or encrypted. I see straight data there - textures, meshes, animation. So I think PS3 version could be easier to extract, at least I hope so. I will post PS3 samples as soon as I can.

They are using some type of lz compression on the 360 files.
I tried using quickbms to extract them but it failed to create a readable file.

So, I'm back with samples from PS3 version of FUSE   I'm almost certain there's no compression or encryption here, with 7z I compressed 40 mb file into 10 mb. Here's the file [http://www.mediafire.com/?2fzrkx0yfm5qtp7](http://www.mediafire.com/?2fzrkx0yfm5qtp7)
Just let me know if more samples are needed

I'm also interested in opening these archives. 
Bough digital version of the game (PS3), transferred it to laptop using PSN Download Manager, and the contents are:


I guess ARC files are TOC files for 00 files.
