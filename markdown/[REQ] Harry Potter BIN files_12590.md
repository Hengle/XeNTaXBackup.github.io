- Post Title: [REQ] Harry Potter BIN files

Hello. I have no idea how to deal with these files. It seems that there is some kind of compression, but some words can be recognized like MEMORY CARD or CHECKPOINT. I can write tools, but first i have to know what compression is this and how to explore that file format.
