- Post Title: VBzip_control.ocx

Wanted to use Mr. Mouse's filecutter but I'm missing the above ocx file.
Actually I'm surprised I couldn't find one on this site (maybe everyone has it, or I have bad searching skills, or they searched for their own though I'm rather paranoid about downloading these things)

Can I get one? lol

It should've been included with the exe, if not then you can find it with this one:

Thanks.
Maybe I was looking at the wrong post.

That one should work. It has the dependencies in the same folder.
