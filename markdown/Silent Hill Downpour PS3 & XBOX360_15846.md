Hi everyone.

I want to translate this game but I can't open the language file.

Is there a tool that can open this file?

I tried these tools but it didn't work.

I want to translate it because I loved this game so much.

I'm waiting for your help.

I dragged the XXX file to the extract program. LOC_DIAGDEVILSPIT-ENG_SF folder has been output.

The above file Loc_DiagDevilsPit-eng contains the folder.

Is there a tool to open the LocalizationTable.LocalizationTable file?

At least export texts and import them back would be enough what we need.

Then we need a tool to import the LOC_DIAGDEVILSPIT-ENG_SF folder.
