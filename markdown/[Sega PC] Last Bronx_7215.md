- Post Title: [Sega PC] Last Bronx

Hello, I have done a little research on this game files.
It's a fighting game released in 1997 (I think), from SEGA. I am working with the PC version, and I wanted to extract all media.

This is a general info on every file contained in the "GAME" directory.

COMMON.IMG - I don't know whats in here, common stuff I guess
BACK0.IMG - Maybe this refers to the game backgrounds (there was more than 3)
BACK1.IMG  
BACK2.IMG    
MAN0.IMG  - This MANX.IMG files have to refer to game characters, there are 9 MAN files, and there are 9 game characters.
MAN1.IMG  
MAN2.IMG  
MAN3.IMG  
MAN4.IMG  
MAN5.IMG  
MAN6.IMG  
MAN7.IMG  
MAN8.IMG
STTEX  - This contains the game textures in BIN format, and I don't know how to extract them.
SCROLL - I don't know whats in here by the name of the files SRC8 SRC16 SKY8 SKY16, and the BIN format there must be some kind of images in here.
MOVIE - All ingame movies in AVI format (cool!)
WAVE - All game sound FX in WAV format (cool!)
DOC - Game help (useless)
LB.EXE - Game executable file     

You can find the unextracted files here:

Whats already extracted?
- Music (using sound juicer)
- Sound FX
- Movies

Whats not extracted?(And I am clueless)
- 3D Models
- Textures
- 2D Graphics (menu and stuff)

PS: Now that I remember, there's a PS2 port of this game. Maybe it's easier to extract
