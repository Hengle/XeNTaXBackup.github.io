Yeah lol.
I sat and thought on it for  afew minutes and realised that we dont have the SKA sound, well i already knew that btu i thought that maybe the game had SUKA (pronounced as ska) so i thought it was a typo lol.
Yeah i looked it up in google, i thought it was MAYBE a french language game but now i know its German lol.
Thankyou.

Downloading the German Demo now. i like these types of games :X

im also about to make a Generic Ascii Injector/Ripper. which means,
a scanner that saves special files for all Texts that it finds in a file, together
with offset and Length of the strings, and an editor where you can rewrite
those, and then later inject this file back to the other file. does that
make any sense?

archive "loca.spr" contains alot of files starting with SLZX and
those seems to be compressed. anyone know if this is a known compressor
or if its custom? , maybe a generic LZ could decompress them.
(im just not that good with lz stuff to do it myself  )

PS: LHA it's lharc, you can unpack with winrar o 7-zip (i think)

The LZX it's for CabArc , M$ compression (wel..really it's from Diamond )

too bad the SLZX exe files where amiga based ;D
*and the links failed on my browser anyway, i was
going to test it on WinUAE*

the SLZX+4 bytes longword contains uncompressed size though,
this value is always bigger than the next SLZX sign (which i guess is
the next file).

still searching :X

I did a little research of this game's files.

The game uses many SPR files - some kind of archives.
Those archives are not compressed, as far as I could tell.
The first file in each archive is not encrypted
(Like the first BIK file in video.spr - the intro movie. You can extract it from the archive by copying it out with a HEX edtior).
The other files in the archives are somehow encrypted.

I hope it helps you. If anyone finds anything interesting, tell me.

To point out. the archives themselves are not compressed. however, the archives contains some files that are identified by "SLZX" and these files
are compressed. but the archives also contains uncompressed files.

I guess the SLZX files are naturally big files, such as TGA or model
files. probably thats why they chose to compress those.

This is the second step.
The first one is to understand what those SPR files are.

I mean, it is obvious they are archives, uncompressed ones, but how can you know where is the end of each file in them?
There is always a header of 0x40 (64) bytes in the SPR files, and there is no seperator between the files (at least not a reapeting one)...

We must understand the file format if we want to be able not just to extract the files, but also to change them.

I tried the explorer and works great, but why use a slzx?   if the data are png's, grannny's and ogg  vorbis? maybe for a the instructions of every scene and dialogs texts?

Exactly. Most (if not all) of the compressed files are text files.
Pngs etc. are not compressed.
