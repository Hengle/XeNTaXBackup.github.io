All I can see in this file is binary data. "seal online data".. can you maybe tell us just a little more what this actually is, because it sure doesn't look like an archive to me.

Well, just get a hexeditor ([http://www.bpsoft.com/](http://www.bpsoft.com/) - hex workshop is a good one), and try to figure out what to change in the file.
