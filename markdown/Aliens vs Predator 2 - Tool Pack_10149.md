- Post Title: Aliens vs Predator 2 - Tool Pack

I have for you very nice toolset for modding and translating Aliens versus Predator 2.
You must install game Aliens Versus Predator 2 and then install game patch included in this pack to run the tools and
update to them.

Aliens vs Predator 2 Toolkit Update 2.0 includes:

DEdit, the AvP2 world editor (also contains texture and sprite utilities).
ModelEdit, the AvP2 model editor.
LithRez, a command-line program for packing and unpacking AvP2 REZ (Resource) files.
Softimage 3.7 exporters.
Maya and 3d Studio Max Exporters.
Sample level files.
Documentation (including step by step instructions for using DEdit and ModelEdit).
Links to on-line resources.

So we can without any problem unpack and repack all files from *.REZ archives.
It is possible to edit textures, models, scripts, sounds and texts.

Texts are in cres.dll file and they can be easy edited by Resource Hacker. Fonts are in AVP2\Interface\Fonts\ folder after unpacking REZ files.

This tool pack can be used also with Aliens vs Predator 2: Primal Hunt  

Enjoy
