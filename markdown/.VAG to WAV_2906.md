- Post Title: .VAG to WAV

I am trying to convert VAG to WAV.

I am an experienced programmer and binary doesn't scare me, but there just isnt any information on the .VAG format, even on google!!!

Does anyone have a link to a good explanation of the VAG format?

It is actually from Guitar Hero 1&2.  It stores the data as a VGS file, which i've then parsed into several VAG files.  As such, I cannot really upload an entire file because they are about 5 megs.  I truncated one of the files to be only about 17k and uploaded it.  Now, from 0x00 to 0x40 is the header data. That I understand.  As I understand it, the rest is similar to ADPCM.  I just need to figure out how to port it to MS WAV

hi,

you'll find everything you need here :

PS2 & PSX ADPCM are similar. they use the same codec (as wii use the same codec as found in gamecube).

Enjoy
