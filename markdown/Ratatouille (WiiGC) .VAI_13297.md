Hello! Is there a way to play the .VAI music files from the GC/Wii versions of Ratatouille? I think I don't have the right coefficients because the codec is Nintendo Gamecube DSP 4-bit ADPCM. Thanks in advance.

If you get any information on this please let me know, was looking into that format as well and couldn't find the co-efficients.

I didn't look into GC version but if you just need the music you can rip it from PS2 version, .joe files can be read by vgmstream.

I actually ripped all the versions except Gamecube/Wii version. I want to rip the GC/Wii ver. just to see if the music is in better quality.

Most likely not seeing how GC discs are much smaller than normal so some GC versions have lower texture quality etc. As an audio issue example, GC version of Over the Hedge has music in Mono while the rest have music in Stereo.
