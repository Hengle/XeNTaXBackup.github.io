- Post Title: Rumble Roses ".TXC" texture conversion?

Using the RRUnpack from the Rumble Roses and SvR threads, I extracted the models (.YOBJ, which I converted to .OBJ using the converter mentioned) and their textures (.TXC) from the Rumble Roses "CH.PAC" and "CH2.PAC" files.
The textures are not in a format friendly to any of my graphics programs OR to my usage of Maya and Poser 4...not to mention the fact that I can't load .TCX images in either one either, so don't suggest that).

Is there a program that will convert the TXC files to anything with an alpha channel like TIM or something? I would really like to experiment with the textures and it would be nice to have the bases covered first.
