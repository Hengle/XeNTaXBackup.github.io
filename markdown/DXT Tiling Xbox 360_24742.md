Hey guys,

Don't know about tiling but to untile you can check Gildor's code here [https://github.com/gildor2/UEViewer/blo ... e.cpp#L519](https://github.com/gildor2/UEViewer/blob/86bd93f1dffba6c98a3acc8f08a59e662e32ccd6/Unreal/UnrealMaterial/UnTexture.cpp#L519)

It does work with dxt5 tho? (I'm just asking because in noesis there is a difference between raw texture data and dxt)

@TKFRvision: UntileCompressedXbox360Texture will return untiled image (compressed or not), it's up to you to decide what to do with the result. Also, noesis supports untiling as well through the following functions:

```
{"imageUntile360DXT", Noesis_ImageUntile360DXT, METH_VARARGS, "returns untiled dxt pixel data. (Oiii)"}, //args=source image array, width, height, block size (e.g. 8 for dxt1, 16 for dxt5)
```

They are already available via api like this (example for DXT5):

```
rapi.imageUntile360DXT(rapi.swapEndianArray(data, 2), imgWidth, imgHeight, 16)
```
