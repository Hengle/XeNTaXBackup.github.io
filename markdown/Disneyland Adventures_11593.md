Can anyone assist me in extracting the data from this game? The format this games uses is .OVS which contains all the data.Below is a file from the game.Hopefully someone can help with extracting the data it contains within.

I hope someone can figure this out! I'm hoping to extract the models and textures from The Haunted Mansion levels!

The title has been released for PC. there are not only OVS files. There is another larger OVL and other smaller AUX. Can someone look at these files and see if it is possible to extract?

Is it also possible to extract the .AUX files with proper file names?
