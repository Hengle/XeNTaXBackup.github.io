- Post Title: Need help with extraction of this game's stuff! (:CLI & .SPR)

Hello, 

I need help on extracting files from this game. It is an old client of a 1997 game called tibia. 
There are CLI and SPR files that I would like to access, can anyone shed some light here? thanks a bunch!

Um, as I remember Tibia was hacked more than 10 years ago   
There are many sources for private servers on the web.
Look for phrases like "Tibia OTS", "Tibia YourOTS" etc. in google.

There are (or were?) whole communities where people were sharing their Tibia
maps, sprites and files.
