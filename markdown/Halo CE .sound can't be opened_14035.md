- Post Title: Halo CE .sound can't be opened

Some sounds for Halo CE can be opened/converted such as this one: [https://www.dropbox.com/s/zndnsdjovkgdd ... sound?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/zndnsdjovkgddie/alertfriend.sound?dl=0)
with Audacity. This audio file has two sounds inside of it.

However, some other files with the same filetype cannot be converted, such as this one: [https://www.dropbox.com/s/qt69g1wo0si2g ... sound?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/qt69g1wo0si2gvx/walk.sound?dl=0)

Is there anyway to convert these files to .wav?

Those .sound files need to be opened in a special program called "Guerilla". You can download the HEK (Halo Editing Kit) to get it, it should be on HaloCEmaps.org
Here's a link: [http://hce.halomaps.org/index.cfm?fid=411](http://hce.halomaps.org/index.cfm?fid=411)
Good luck with your future mods!
Edit: you can't export the sounds to .wav, your best bet is to record them while playing them in the program

@Pepsee completely explained it. Yes, you need to get HekPLUS, extract the .sound file you want, then you need Guerilla, to open it. (You can't extract the sounds, but you can play and record them with Audacity).
