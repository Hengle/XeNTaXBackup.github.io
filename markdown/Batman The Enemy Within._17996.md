- Post Title: Batman The Enemy Within.

I know that I could find this in here but I would like to get direct help . So I have a question because i try to translate Batman TEW to Polish and I have a few problems. I was using TTG tool by quckly but I dunno why it doesnt work for me anymore. When I extract Ep2_data.ttarch2 and decrypt boot_english.landb to txt and then when im done and trying to encrypt program stops working and crashes. Next thing is that I need to get polish letters like ąęó etc. and I dont know how. 
Im sorry that im opening next topic but im getting annoyed by scrolling like 50 pages and finding nothing that could help. Thanks for help.

PS: would be appreciated if someone post ttg tool that worked for him with batman the enemy within.

UPDATE
Im okey. Now I just need to know where I can find .font any ideas ?
