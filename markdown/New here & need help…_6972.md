- Post Title: New here & need help…

Hi! Well this my 1st post & my 1st time here, but I wanted to ask around get some advice. What I am interested in right now is finding programs that can rip textures/meshes out of a game with. Not that I can’t do it by hand, but I’m interested in getting the textures straight out of the Lego games to cut corners & to be as exact as possible so that I can make customized figures of my own that match up with the games. Here’s an example of a Captain America that I was working on a # of years ago –

The thing is that the mapping of the texture might be different in the game than what is needed to apply on a figure. And I just want to play with it a bit. 

The formats that I am planning on ripping from are PC, PS2, & XBOX 360… & the operating systems that I will be using them under will be XP & Win 7 (though mostly Win 7). I have done game moding in the past… but that was like 10 years ago. I don’t know what editors that are out there now that will do the job. Can someone point me in the right direction?

Thanks again!

Derrick
