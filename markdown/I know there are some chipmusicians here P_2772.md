Atleast i know Mr.Mouse have been making music somewhere
someplace, somehow , in the background,
we are currently holding a 3xTheme chip compo at [http://www.battleofthebits.org](http://www.battleofthebits.org)
supporting a big amount of different chipformats. (including SID, Sega Master System with more), so any chipper is free to join!

only one day left for submissions though 

i myself made NSF, XM, and Atari SAP entries.

would be fun to get even more people in there for chipping!

All current submissions!

[http://battleofthebits.org/depository.p ... l&comp=243](http://battleofthebits.org/depository.php?act=view&tracks=all&comp=243)

and i would guess that all entries by "Strobe" are mine 
when you click on a music link you will get to a specific page
to that track, there you can either download the original format file
or the mp3 render, the mp3 render should come to you by simply pressing the "Download" link =P

Hehe, how did you get to those computers, or were you using emulators?  

Sounds nice, real 8-bit-ish

There's no emulator that can capture the sound of the 6581 and 8580 chips. You need the real thing.

Well, some of us there uses GoatTracker (w32) for SID making.
(and some others use C64 software, like DMC and Polytracker.)

But ofcourse, for getting the REAL sound the track should be replayed on
a real c64

It should be composed on the real c64 in the first place or at least use the SID chips like HardSID etc. If you don't you compose with the wrong sound, and listen to a different tune when you do play it on a c64.

The SID chip doesn't allow it. There are multiple "issues" of the same type (e.g. 6581 R1, R2 and R3, plus the 8580) that are emulated not 100% or not at all, so a tune composed for the 8580 will sound totally different on a 6581, especially when bass-filters are used.
