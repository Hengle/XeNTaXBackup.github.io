Hi there!

Can anyone identify the file format of the Gears of War 3 videos? 
[http://www.gamefront.com/files/20976658 ... ngMovie.7z](http://www.gamefront.com/files/20976658/GoW3_LoadingMovie.7z)
Is this some kind of compressed bik file?

An help is highly appreciated!

Have you downloaded my sample file? Apparently not. The files are no bik movies.
