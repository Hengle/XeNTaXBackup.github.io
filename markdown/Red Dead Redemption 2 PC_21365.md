Anyone know anything about RPF8 algorithm or if someone can see the data in the binary file let me know.

What are auto faces ? That could be useful. And I see that it was just the file I exported. I was able to export raw.data now I have all the faces/uvs/vertex. Thank you for your reply.

I can't access the download link to your files.

Can you try to reupload them?

No need to, the extractor is already in the making I guess. Just found out yesterday.

Its finished and even has a thread in this forum from a month or two ago.
But its the PS4 release, it doesn't support PC release unless the format hasn't changed.

I'm sort of late but guys could you help me out please? I'm trying get into RDR2 Files to access 3D Models and Textures. I have experience with models and textures I just have no idea how to extract content out of the files.

I use Render Doc. Snap my image. Then in the settings of Render Doc, save content as RAW. Then you can open the files in Model Researcher. Thats how I was able to do it.

Do you use some special trick to attach RenderDoc to RDR2? If I run the Rockstar Games Launcher under RenderDoc (which appears to work), the game crashes on start for me... EDIT: Never mind, some combination of updating to the latest NVIDIA drivers and reinstalling RenderDoc fixed the problem. Sorry for the noise!

(My game version is 1232.17, RenderDoc v1.6)

GPU driver update can be a really good idea. Check the system on a latest updates. Or, you can try an easier way and use one of the free driver packs from this [thinkmobiles.com/blog/best-free-driver-updater/](thinkmobiles.com/blog/best-free-driver-updater/) review. This will help you determine the availability and relevance of all your drivers and update the necessary, respectively.
