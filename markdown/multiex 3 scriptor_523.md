- Post Title: multiex 3 scriptor

Hi,

I'm trying to create a script but whenever I try to save check or test a file I get the error:

Run Time Error '9'
Subscript out of range

Any suggestions on how to solve this?

I'm using multiex v 3.9.68 on windows XP and the scriptor is V 1.51

Cheers

Hmm, can you perhaps copy the script from the script editing window and paste it here, just before you wish to save it? That will tell me more.
