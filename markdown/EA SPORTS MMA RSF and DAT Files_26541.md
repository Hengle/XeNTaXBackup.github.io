- Post Title: EA SPORTS MMA RSF and DAT Files?

Hi, I am trying to extract the models and textures from EA Sports MMA. I was able to open the AST Files and find inside them RSF and DAT files. I am assuming the RSF contains the mesh and the DAT contains the textures. Is there a way to convert the RSF to OBJ/FBX and the DAT to a DDS/PNG?

The 3D Object Converter supports the
EA Sports MMA	*_GEOM 3d model files,
EA Sports MMA 	*_COMP, *_COL texture files for load.
