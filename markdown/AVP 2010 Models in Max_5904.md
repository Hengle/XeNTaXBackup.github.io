- Post Title: AVP 2010 Models in Max?

Seen a few of the models around on the net. Were they ripped using 3d ripper or did someone find a method? Looked around on here a bit and saw a few things about it, but couldn't put enough of it together to do it. Can anyone offer any advice on getting the models and textures please?
