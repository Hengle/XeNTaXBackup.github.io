- Post Title: realMYST 3D models

It's really old game. I've managed to extract .dni archives but I have no idea how to open models. Could anyone take a look at it? Sample file: [http://sta.sh/0fct0hffds2](http://sta.sh/0fct0hffds2)

In the 15 years since it's release, no one has publicly released any program that can extract the models from the original realMyst. But hey, realMyst Masterpiece was released last year, which has updated versions of all the maps and models from the original realMyst, and it uses the Unity Engine, so there are plenty of tools on XeNTaX that can extract models from that.
