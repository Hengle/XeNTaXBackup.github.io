- Post Title: Changing sprites in-game

Hi! I'm trying to change the sprites of an Unity game, I've achieved it before with games that have low or non protection in their sprites, we are talking of .png images or sounds etc. But I can't with this game, I unpacked the texture .tex.pvr files successfully with UnityEX and also successfully imported the .tex.pvr or images I want to replace with the old ones, but when I go in-game the sprite just doesn't change, yes it's an android game that requires you to stay online to play but again I've "changed" others successfully being online games.
BTW there are no errors or any kind of messages when I start the game so that's why I find it kind of odd.
