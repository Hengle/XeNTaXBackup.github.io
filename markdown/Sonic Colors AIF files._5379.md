That's because they're AAX files. AAX files are container file like AIX that contain multiple ADX files. Don't try to extract the ADX files from it. AAX files have an intro adx file and loop adx file in order to loop.

So, can they be converted to a playable format? the .aax files play fine using VGMStream, uthe _aif files and _wav files doesn't.

Oh I'm sorry. I misread your post. Yea, these seem unsupported right now. I'll see if I can figure them out and add support for them to vgmstream. These seem to have Nintendo DSP in them.

So, the files extract from the .csb can be played using GoldWave, sort of.


Both these work, but the VOX has more static and is louder.
