hi there, i was wondering if you guys could take a look at this file for me.
the file is from knockout kings 2001. I'd like to be able to edit the models and textures so i can add my own fighters to the game.

the identification for this files reminds me of "Rob Northern" Cruncher on the amiga.....=o ...dont know if this is available for PC though, so its probably not what i think it is, however the file is packed/encrypted.

Ofcourse it can be done. nothing is impossible. however it is harder
with packed files. especially for modding, because even if you manage
to unpack the files and modifiy them, you still have to repack them
again to use them in the game. and thats usually the part where
people give up. (i know i do =o )


but, the file extension with states that it is an EFS file, now i know that
EFS might be some kind of new texture format? i think ive seen
it around here somewhere. i hope someone else know what to do, because 
right now im kinda stuck. =o
