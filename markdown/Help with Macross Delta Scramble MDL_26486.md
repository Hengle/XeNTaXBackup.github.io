- Post Title: Help with Macross Delta Scramble MDL

Hi; i looked in other forums for this question but everything have failed; 

1. I've unpacked Macross Delta Scrambre with dragon_ball_z_boz.bms (artdink games script) from Luigi's gallery 

2. When i try to import the Mdl (from Macross Delta Scramble) to Blender with the Macross 30 unfinished script it don't works; also i've tryed noesis (it only reads the .gpx textures) 

I found a python script for Blender 2.49 but the textures and materials are lost and some models (SV-262) give an error. 

Can somebody help me?

Thanks in advance

Edit: Solved, thanks
