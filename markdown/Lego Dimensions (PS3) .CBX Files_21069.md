- Post Title: Lego Dimensions (PS3) .CBX Files

I have tried to find a method to convert these files, but I cannot find anything about them. For the files, I have attached the [folder](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1R_GvUX_O2VXdFHSFwnaO3SsVsgzuRY1r) for the Portal 2 DLC. I am not entirely sure that the .CBX files (located in the AUDIO/VO/DX folder) contain the audio; it could be contained in the .SOUND_EVENT files in the AUDIO/EVENTS folder, but I cannot find any conclusive info on those files either.

Does anyone have any info or better experience with these files?

I have DLC files from the WII U version. You want those?

Sounds great! Will this include the DLC's cutscenes, as well? I was going to try and convert the PS3's .MSF files after the .CBX's were cracked.

Not to worry. You’ll get your samples soon enough. If you got them already, I hope you have looked at them.
