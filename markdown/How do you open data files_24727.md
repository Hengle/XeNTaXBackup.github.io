- Post Title: How do you open data files?

I really need your help guys!

I'm trying to figure out how to get the IDs from these data/table files. Seems there are event names but no IDs to associate the audio files.
The file was in a folder called "db," but I wasn't able to open it with anything else except Notepad and HxD.

Can anyone help?

Here's the file: [https://mega.nz/file/O1tkVCqJ#8EdmsMV3Y ... MxC2MzbDRQ](https://mega.nz/file/O1tkVCqJ#8EdmsMV3YSiOLEanSeDKD1ZgLY-I8AkTJMxC2MzbDRQ)
