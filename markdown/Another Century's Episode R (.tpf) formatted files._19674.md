- Post Title: Another Century's Episode R (.tpf) formatted files.

I've been spending my day tearing through the files in here, which thankfully, a lot of the Dark Souls tools work perfectly since they share the same file format, but then I get to the .tpf files and none of the tools work anymore, QuickBMS tpf to dds doesn't work, noesis plugins for tpf don't preview or extract them, and any other tool made for tpf files (texmod, umod, etc.) only work when running a game (which obviously doesn't really work for a PS3 game)

I'll link them through my google drive since i can't seem to attach anything.

Has anyone had any luck with those formats?
