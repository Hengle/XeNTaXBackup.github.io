It's a nice pic, but totally useless, why don't you upload some sample file instead?

Is anyone here working on this?

I used the quickbms script found here [viewtopic.php?f=10&t=10557](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=10557) to extract the files. The 3D model files seem simple enough to reverse. Unfortunately that quickbms script doesn't extract files with names or folders so you end up with 10s of thousands of files named 1, 2, 3 ,4 and so on. Making it really hard or nearly impossible to figure out which files go together.

Anyone up for making a script which extracts files with full names?

I had a glance at .ldm using hex2obj (view link in my sig):

H2O file for 2nd submesh:

Vb0
0x0
0x7958 1911

0x0 255

(Looks like the test.obj window (SM1) shows the uvs for a part of submesh 2,
the small structure in the left lower corner.)

Guess someone with leisure and interest could build some nice mesh from the extracted ldm level pieces:

I was able to extract the data from cross fire by Howfie and the models were great. in some way Howfie seems to be half retired and I thought that may other high skilled user could keep on the extracting the gundam games.
