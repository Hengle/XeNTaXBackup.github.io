- Post Title: Dead Space .str (For translation)

Hi.

I am looking for the method of translating the subtitles of "Dead Space". 
(The language is Japanese.)


 SampleFile1.zip
DeadSpaceTextSample (114.75 KiB) Downloaded 80 times


A part of the subtitle seems to be included in the file"12F4D5F8.str". 
I think that I should replace the font file. However, I was not able to find it...


Does anyone have information?
Please help if it is interested. 

I'm sorry in bad English.

Thank you.

Wait...your trying to translate the subtitles FROM japanese? or TO japanese?
You could always just get the Japanese version of the game, or the english version, and just replace the files, from there its pretty simple I think.

Hello, in my case, I really need to extract the *. str files in the folder 'text'. I'm trying to translate into my language (Brazil). And then to build .str again.

I appreciate all the help possible. Thank's.
