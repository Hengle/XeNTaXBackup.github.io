I'm planning to start the biggest project of my game hacking life. I'm going to attempt to write a MaxScript that imports .XNO model files from Sonic the Hedgehog 2006 into 3DS Max. However, I am a complete n00b at MaxScript. I just decided that instead of requesting a script from one of the experts here, I would just learn how to do it myself.

Trouble is, I've found nothing that would give an inexperienced programmer any helpful tips for writing a MaxScript for this purpose. At minimum, I'd like each model to import with all textures and bones, even if the script is as bare-bones as that. Is there anyone here who knows where to start with this type of script? Also, is there a specific hex editor that would work best for the job, or are they all equally effective? I have XVI32.

This is something I'm determined to do. I'll probably be able to work on this in whatever spare time I have. If I get this scripting thing down pat, I'll probably never bother you again.
