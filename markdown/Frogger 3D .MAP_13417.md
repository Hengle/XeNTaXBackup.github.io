- Post Title: Frogger 3D .MAP

Hi, I was wondering if any sorts of 3D graphics can be extracted from these MAP files found in Frogger 3D for PC?
These are maps in the game.

Anyone? Can anyone help? Can't anyone do anything? Can't shakotay get down on his knees and service this person in a timely manner? Can't he be "helped" in finding his precious geometry? Is there no one left in this cold world that CARES?

> anything? anything I could do with hex2obj?you could search for point clouds - but from a first glance I don't see any (maybe you'll do if you search seriously)

you could search for structures; for example there are 28 bytes blocks with 44 43 30 FF contained in SWP1.MAP;

good luck

haha sorry, I often feel like my posts get ignored and buried by other requests and I figure they're usually very simple and it'd be beneficial for me to learn from other members who know what they're doing moreso than me. I don't post very often and when I do I usually can go on my own as soon as I know what to do.

If you've made an actual attempt on your own (unlike the vast majority of people that ask to have formats looked at here), you should discuss what you've tried and what/where you've investigated in the file to show you've made a real effort. I know I'm much more inclined to help people who are really trying to help themselves, and it's likely that so are quite a few others here. But I'm only going to believe someone's invested effort if they show it rather than just saying "I looked at this but I can't figure it out!"

Nothing? God damn it, this is such an injustice. Great game like this with a few things needing to be fixed such as traffic spawning, and it'd be easy to make a decomplier/complier, but nope.

The above is such a classic response from another thread that someone gave when a request to figure out a .LUA format wasn't met in a timely manner. 

What it means: It is an "injustice" that the person is not helped. Also, this generic car game needs just a few things to be fixed, so COME ON, hurry up already. Finally, it would actually be EASY to make a decompiler/compiler, says the person. 

One wonders why this person would need our assistance, when what it wants would actually be EASY to do. 

My response.

What's the point of all this banter lol. Yeah sure, people can seem a bit witty in how they word their requests, but who cares, right? No need to post anything if it doesn't help anyone or anything, just seems silly.

I agree, what is the point of all this banter about all this banter? What is the point of forums? What is the point of communication, or interacting with human beings in a sorrowful dance that can only end in the hedgehog's remorse? These are the questions we must ask in order to uncover the secrets of Frogger 3D, because like Frogger, we are destined to patterns of repetition which are fueled by an illusion of meaning.

The header of the .MAP files says: "Maybe this time it'll all work fine"

Very comforting mister coder, very comforting. 

Also, what has this thread come to? Kermit leapfrogged to the quintessence of Life, the Universe and Everything: Pointless Banter. And women. But without the women. 

But hell, maybe this time it'll all work fine.

Are we even 100% sure models are in the .map files? I'm only asking because the only other option, being .wad, seems like a common extension for archives on PSX games, even if the game was ported to PC, and for the record this is a PSX/PC game.

What I've got so far from both can be found [here (.map)](http://highwayfrogs.freeforums.net/thread/8/map-file-research) and [here (.wad).](http://highwayfrogs.freeforums.net/thread/7/wad-file-research) Unfortunately I'm not super pro on file reversing, so I can't get and give any more information.

Miles (OP poster) has some [additional information posted here](http://highwayfrogs.freeforums.net/thread/15/all-frogger-file-format-information) that is not in this or those topics.

Since the DL link in the OP seems to be disfunct, I've gone and uploaded a file of both specified files here: [http://www.mediafire.com/download/1zd34 ... nd_WAD.zip](http://www.mediafire.com/download/1zd34refyr7mudn/Frogger_MAP_and_WAD.zip)

Cheers!

i got a point cloud from your SUB1.map sample under the VRTX section   


i could not figure out the face indices though

That's amazing progress! 
You're probably the one who has gotten furthest so far on this anywhere, so I must encourage you to keep at it. Hopefully you can figure out the faces or get help with them.

This is what I get:

Seems to use quads for faces and needs face indices offset (74).
hex2obj uses both but not together, that's the problem.

I wrote a simple program that extracted the data and saved it without offsets, and was able to construct this:


I have a few questions:
a) How exactly did you calculate D190 as the starting address? Was there a calculation involved or was it just a bit of guess-work?
b) Any clue why certain chunks of the map are missing? I can't seem to find a pattern to this, except for the trees that likely aren't fully modelled.

Was there a calculation involved or was it just a bit of guess-work?it was just a little bit scrolling up and down in the editor (as always  ) Oh, I forgot, counting down 80 bytes each (which I think should be 40 only). If you go to 0xd140 you'll experiencea  maximum face index of 65323 which I just "felt" to be too big. Also there's a change in the blocksize in the lower address regions (reduced by 4).

Here's some pic using more FIs (9855) and an FI offset of 34:

(quads must be used instead of triangles)

yes, it's upside down (to show that interesting spiral at the bottom)

Huzzah! This looks a bit more complete.


Now to figure out how to texture this.

Ah. I see. When I tried that I thought that the data under "GRID" was what I was looking for. (Still a bit new to this   )

Interesting, I wonder if this is data to some "scenic" models like the leaves on trees.

EDIT: The spiral on the bottom is actually a bunch of rivers connected.

Been working a bit, and have an automatic extractor, along with most of the file format figured out. My issue now is I can't seem to get textures working in the .obj format. 

How would I format .mtl files (and obj) to apply textures like this?


I have the UV data but for simplicity's sake I've been using vt 0,0 for the time being. What changes need to be made to the files below to make the textures above work?

These files were my attempt to just get any texture at all to show. I'd like it if I could see a working example of any textures being applied to this model in different places. I can make the extractor automate everything if I understand the pattern.

In blender for example, in the uv image editor you can load a texture
(in newer versions of blender you may need to create a material before)
but you'll need a proper uv map for that.

With all vt being 0.0 0.0. in your FOR2.obj it's impossible to show.

Hmmm I think I'm misunderstanding the format then. Since this isn't a single texture for the entire object but each face using a texture from a list of tiles is anything different?

EDIT: Nevermind, earlier today I managed to get this:


The textures aren't right because the game has a hardcoded list of texture ids in its code while I just used them by their index. However, I'm unsure why the UVs don't work. I'm performing the same calculation I believe the game performs.
U = ((unsigned byte) Stored U Value * (unsigned byte) Texture Width) / 0xFF
V = ((unsigned byte) Stored V Value * (unsigned byte) Texture Height) / 0xFF
However, that doesn't seem to work, I get the image from above. I don't expect you to have an answer to this without more information, which I'm happy to provide.

Woohoo, I've figured it out.
While I still need to make by hand some manual data for each map to be extracted, I've figured out the format woohoo!


(I haven't finished writing the texture remap data so some places still have incorrect textures, but overall it works   )

Thanks @shakotay2 I would have never gotten this far if it weren't for your help a few months ago.

Working on a level-editor next.

It's been a while since I've posted here. Thought I'd give an update. We've made progress on our complete Frogger modding tool.

@shakotay2 Once again, thanks for your help back when. Just needed a little push in the right direction.
