- Post Title: Armored Core .flv's

I'm trying to get the models for the weapons from Armored Core 4A but I've gotten to the point where I have access to the .flv files (which are said to be the models) but I have no idea how to get the mesh data from those. I have seen people have some success with hex2obj but I have no idea how to use the program or navigate the hex code, does anyone have any knowledge or an easier way to get the models?

Some animations get broken and most of the Arms Forts crash out Max but otherwise great tool.
