File was Simple XBOX ADPCM with a riff header.

try this tool also its a command line so it should be easy.

xbadpdec -r "filename.str" "Filename.raw"

Finally got round to converting all the wav files from FF1. 

As there were over 450 files, the command-line method would have taken me ages so I installed the xbox adpcm codec and batch-converted the lot with Adobe Audition.

If anyone is interested I'll post the link for them.

How can you tell if your internet is good for xbox live? I have xbox live, but i was wondering, how can you tell if your internet is good enough for xbox live? I mean without lag. Like how can you tell if your internet is good enough to give you 3 or 4 bars connection to the host on xbox live?
