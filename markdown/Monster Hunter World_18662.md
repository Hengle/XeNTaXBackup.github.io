- Post Title: Monster Hunter World

Hello, Monster Hunter World PC version is out yesterday. I hope this is ok to ask in the forum.

I know is very new, but is anyone here able to share some information on how I can rip 3d model from Monster Hunter World PC or PS4 format? 
The game is using MT Framework.

I only have experience ripping model from the previous monster hunter game on 3DS example: Monster Hunter Stories. Hope someone can help. Many thanks.

I`m a sculptor, I would like to be able to rip the model for the accurate sculpt.
