- Post Title: Expendable (Millennium Soldier Expendable) PSX .LNG file

Hello, I have tried every tools on LNG that exist but this one looks like is compressed somehow by their custom software, is possible to hex edit it but adding new letters breaks the entire text in the entire game.

Here I sent a sample in possiblity to find a solution.

Best regards.
