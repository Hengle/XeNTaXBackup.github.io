- Post Title: Monster Hunter Frontier Z .pac files

i was able to get the .pac files from MHFZ for (what i assume to be) the Monters and wondered if the contents were accessible at all?

heres a link incase anyone wishes to have a look [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OyzPij ... MSZIn/view](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OyzPijXysozv-FbN3nKMUyMMkwrMSZIn/view)


EDIT: also i forgot to mention weather or not the .pac files would contain .mod files like many other Capcom games once decrypted
anyways beyond that anyone who wishes to have a look at the files do let me know what you find (i would do it myself but i possess no knowledge on coding and such)
thanks

I apologize for bumping such an old thread, but I am also looking into opening these files. Did anyone figure anything out from these files?

Nobody in their right mind will share a tool since this is an actively maintained paid MMORPG.

Well I am looking for someone who can give me a way to open these packages so I can try to open the models and textures inside. I have no problem in keeping any opening method private, I just need it for myself. Updates are not an issue either.

Hey, did you ever figure out how to open these? I'd really appreciate it if you could share the files too since it seems the original link expired or somethin:")
