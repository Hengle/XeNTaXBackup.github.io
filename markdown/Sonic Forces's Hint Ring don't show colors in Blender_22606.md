- Post Title: Sonic Forces's Hint Ring don't show colors in Blender

Hello ^^

Using [this](https://github.com/blueskythlikesclouds/SkythTools), I managed to convert Sonic Forces's Hint Ring into a .fbx.

Checking it with Noesis, it showed the spheres colors like shown on the pic below.



But when I open it in Blender 2.82a, there's no colors. Is there a way to fix that?

You can download the files [there](https://www.mediafire.com/file/iofytikl129o647/file).
There are the .dds and .fbx files, as well as the original .model and .material files in case they're needed
