you used the bms script from aluigi for extract files, unfortunately    the script only work with frostbite 2 compression not in frostbite 3 because the compression is a little bit different, maybe aluigi can take a look at the format

also....maybe you can obtain correct files with BF4 python script from bfeditor forum

hi,
welcome to the forum!  

You should consider to delete the parallel topic you opened.
(That's possible as long as noone answered there.)

btw: I simply ignore parallel topics because they tend to confuse everything.

I had a look at the opening post of this thread:
[viewtopic.php?f=21&t=11261&p=92871&hilit=+Plants#p92871](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=21&t=11261&p=92871&hilit=+Plants#p92871)

where I got a 4k sunflower_hand_mesh after executing frostbite.bms
on Installed_Characters.toc but no luck getting a decent point cloud handling the rectangled data as shorts or halffloats:
