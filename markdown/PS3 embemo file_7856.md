I have the Files here for Gemini Saga, EMO, EMB, EMA, 2RY, EMM, FMA, FBA, FCM, FDM, but I can't open them, even using piecemontee's program. It says Runtime Error and closes. What should I do? I want to export the model files to Pepakura format

There's nothing wrong except for the missing eyes part.
I'm not sure what's wrong.

You can get full rigged models with kensou's tool and emo2smd.

But again, how did you guys find the faces??

Well I'm sorry to bump into this thread again, but I want to explain how to get SS Shougeki textures in a proper way. This method can be used for some other games (aka X Blades for example) which use dds textures but they don't have a proper header and normally you extract them using zblib.

Programs we need:

Texture Finder
A hex editor (I'm using HxD).
Photoshop (or any image editor that supports dds format).
And Piecemontee's SFIV assets explorer.

My Skydrive with some tools if someone is lost:

[https://skydrive.live.com/#cid=FFBE4E57 ... 49FCBE!177](https://skydrive.live.com/#cid=FFBE4E570949FCBE&id=FFBE4E570949FCBE!177)

So here we go:

Open SFIV Assets explorer, check the Bin endian option for console files version and then open the .emb you need. Extract the files inside as raw files.

Open texture finder and open any of the files you extracted. For saving you the time to play with all the options, SS Shougeki are DXT1, DXT3 or DXT5 dds textures and normally they use these resolutions:

64
128
256
1024
2048

In this case we can see that the texture has a width of 1024 pixels:

[](http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/39/45521766.jpg/)

If we scroll down the texture we can see that the height is at least the double of it's width (until the mipmaps start).

[](http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/690/52510964.jpg/)

So the full resolution is 1024x2048 pixels as DXT5 texture.

The next thing to do if you don't have any source file from where to copy a header is to open your image editor and create a 1024x2048 files in RGBA mode. Save it as dds file with DXT5 argb with interpolated alpha:

[](http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/152/77675014.jpg/)

Now open your hex editor, open the dds you created and open the file extracted from the emb, then in your hex editor, copy from the first byte until you see the end of 0's and the info of the image starts.

[](http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/341/59045284.jpg/)

The final step you just have to paste the selection you did at the beginning of the extracted file and save as dds.

[](http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/222/31221605.jpg/)

[](http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/441/12480079.jpg/)

The result:

[](http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/15/ddsfile.jpg/)

Edit:

The textures must be uncompressed.

See ya.

Hey thanks! this had helped me quite abit. However I am having issues with EMB Extractor.pl getting "out of memory" when I try to extract the emb file.

While on Texture Finder I can only export bmp file (I can see bmp headers when I open in hex editor).

What did you use to extract the emp?

I hope someone can look at this again:

This is an emo file converted with kensou's tool:



When I delete this part in the hex editor I can get the eyes displayed:

If someone want's to take a look, here is the sample:

well the topic is really intersting, so my question now is how correct colors and UNWRAP? because the objects when you export to OBJ are multiobjects, as you can see they have no only 1 mesh, meshes are divided in parts, I mean helmet, gloves, upbody,lowbody, boots, here you have a example and really textures to bad quality and colors are not same as original texture, because gold set don't look like that.

Unfortunately, my face is this model cannot be complete and want God to develop an import tool. This is a classic animated story

No one is interested in this game. Someone knows how to get the face and some missing model parts and hasn't answered my Pm's (even though I explained how to get textures before), so forget about this crap.

Lol how can someone NOT like Saint Seiya?? they don't deserve to be so neglected,i also posted that i need help but i'm being ignored but i won't give up because i see all sorts of asian game models but no Saint Seiya,i don't think it's imposible to rip a perfect posable character,just needs a little work if they stop being lazy.
