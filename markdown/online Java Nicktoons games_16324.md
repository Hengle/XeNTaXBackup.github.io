- Post Title: online Java Nicktoons games

Normally getting online models or resources is a snap. Flash games in Firefox of course and most assets. Else search the code and find the file link. Or screen save a 3d model or image right? No such luck here though and I spent a whole night going through the code. Best as I can tell they externally link there stuff? Also ninja ripper failed me on this. No specifics needed, just want to grab whatever I can however I can and I'll work with it from there (for example I'll manually T-Pose em if I have to). TY in advance to anyone that comes up with anything.
