Model format same as (or similar to) Seven Souls Online.
Chrrox wrote an import script for the models: [viewtopic.php?f=16&t=6337](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=6337)

I think I was looking into the bsb format some time ago but didn't really get it.
Maybe if I look at it now I can parse the format.

Oh.

Hmm, maybe someone will upload it onto korean file-sharing sites.

How do we find links to the clients anyways? It seems like a lot of Korean companies like to use cdn services.

Would I still need to be able to create an account?

Like I went to the DL page: [http://ls.pmang.com/index.nwz?mKey=7&sKey=1](http://ls.pmang.com/index.nwz?mKey=7&sKey=1)
But don't see that in the source. Is there usually somewhere specific to look?

normally if you have an account you can look through the java script code and find the download page links I have done this for a bunch of games but it does not work for every site but most korean sites must use some standard template or something.
