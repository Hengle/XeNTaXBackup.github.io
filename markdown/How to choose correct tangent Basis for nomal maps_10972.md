- Post Title: How to choose correct tangent Basis for nomal maps

Hi,i want to talk about tangent space normal map format here.
There are so much engines caculate tangent basis,,like 3dsmax,maya,blender,,directx...etc
I usually use 3dsmax to render ,but there are all kinds of normal maps we ripped from games created by different engines.
(I'm talking about tangent space,,not world space)
So,,is there any principle to determine which method they used?
Or we can just only test it one by one,try and error method?
If we don't choose the correct method,,it useually cause ugly lighting problem especially in seam line area.
Could Xnormal covert different normal map basis?Or should we use photoshop's nvidia plugin ?
Thank you~
