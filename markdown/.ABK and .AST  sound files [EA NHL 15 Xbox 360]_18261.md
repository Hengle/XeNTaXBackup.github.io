- Post Title: .ABK and .AST  sound files [EA NHL 15 Xbox 360]

Hey guys, I'm trying to figure out how to extract and overwrite some sound files. I have found some information on the files, but I am not sure how I would go about extracting the files.

The file that I'll be using as an example with is a smaller one, the goal horns.

The ABK files are small, 4KB - 2000KB depending on what they are (horns, crowd, sfx) and have a header of ABKC (41 42 4B 43). The horns.abk doesn't have much to it, just a bit of data and at the end of the file it has some words, they look to be the state of the audio. 

The AST files are big, and as a matter of fact there is no 'horns' one, I believe they are packed in the sfx.ast file. The header is S10S (53 31 30 53). There is a bunch of data, no words.

I imagine the ABK file links to the AST file in some way, with the AST file being just data. 

Here are the files if anybody wants to have a look: [https://we.tl/3Oh5NSqeFN](https://we.tl/3Oh5NSqeFN)

Thank you in advance to anybody that can help

New info! I found a bunch of .abk files in a new folder, all are different files (horns/chants per each team). Awesome, now how would I go about getting audio from that file and replacing it

I also encountered a few AST files that I would like to try and get converted.

It's NBA Elite 11 for the PS3, so also by Electronic Arts. The AST files in this game use the same S10S header (53 31 30 53) as mentioned by clou14. I can provide a small AST file (between 1 to 4MB) via PM for anyone that wants to take a try at converting the file into an audio file for me.

Edit - I've just uploaded the smallest AST file here:

Thanks in advance!
