- Post Title: Gameloft .pig 3D models.

I've been trying to import .pig models that were taken from the gameloft TinTin game for iOS or convert them, however, it seems that all the tools that exist do not work for this version of the extension, and I was wondering if it would be possible to get a little help, these are all that I used:

-PIG2FBX
-Gameloft_pig_importer
-gameloftcustompakextractorgui_bin

and this is the model and textures: [http://www.mediafire.com/file/dwpdignkn ... s.zip/file](http://www.mediafire.com/file/dwpdignknr4fq1s/ch_thompsons.zip/file)

Using AMR:

The format is a bit different than those from the Asphalt games, but a few adjustments should do the trick.

Open your sample pig file through the menu File > Open. Fill in all necessary values aside from the default ones as shown in the screenshot. Press Preview to test your results.
