Hey,

I decoded all the music files, but those  that are multichannel wont play in winamp etc, or open up as multicannel .wavs in AUDACITY either. Is there another multichannel editor that will support this, in case i can seperate the channels to seperate 2 channel stereo wav files? EG coralsea.fsb becomes coralseaaction.wav. The corresponding .def file says coralsea tension, and coralsea action, suggesting 4 channels, two songs of almost same, one more ambient, one more action.

Can you describe the technique to decode the FSB files?  I'm about to start that task.

Mplayer has some multi-channel capability, to merge channels, etc...

Thanks, anyway.  I found that the Russian ToWav tool decodes the FSB files (music, dialog and sound) into two channel WAV files just fine.  I think I posted a link to this utility over in my HP post... Enjoy.
