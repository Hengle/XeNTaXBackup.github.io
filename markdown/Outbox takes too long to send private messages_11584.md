- Post Title: Outbox takes too long to send private messages

Hi guys, I was wondering if others have this same problem with this forum's private messaging system.

Every time I send a private message, it takes hours or days to leave the outbox.

could it be that it only leaves the outbox when the other user logs on?

I think it only leaves the Outbox after the recipient has read it, then it moves to the Sent box.

Thanks for clarifying.   I thought it had to be in sent items.
