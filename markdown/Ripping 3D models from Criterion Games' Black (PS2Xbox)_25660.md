stlevel.bin = character models
bg1_ak1.db = viewmodels
unit_01.bin = level models



While I was only able to extract textures with [Edness' Noesis plugins](https://github.com/EdnessP/scripts/tree/main/burnout) I'm still trying to rip all 3D models (stlevel.bin/bg1_ak1.db support skeletons/animations) from Criterion Games' Black (2006).

XBOX version; used a point cloud skinner because I'm too lazy to care for the face indices...
