- Post Title: Hot Wheels Velocity X's .xpc/ .xgc/ .xps archive files

Hello, I need a lot of help opening these archive files from Hot Wheels Velocity X that are .xpc on the PC version, .xgc on the Gamecube version and .xps on the Playstation version
I was able to rip the raw midi files that control the music, but that's all so far

ANY help is greatly appreciated

.xpc's available on request

Well it isn't the way you probably think I obtained it, but I got something working today:

So what I did is I found a version of the dolphin emulator that uses directx9, and booted it through the program 3D ripper DX (a geometry ripper for directx9 programs), booted into the GameCube version of velocity X that I had ripped, and ripped it all to obj and their respective dds textures. Went into blender and took everything but the car out, and it scales weirdly, but I figured out the exact values on how to fix the scaling issue, and that's the result! I'm in the process of doing that whole thing for each car, I've got 5 already

YES! Thank you! If it's possible, do you think you could do the same thing but with the audio files?

Can you post how you fix it so it's not slanted? I recently ripped some stuff form Harvest Moon: A Wonderful Life and am having a eral hard time with trying to fix that. I've downloaded plug ins for blender but can't find it. I'm not good with blender at all. But I can follow tutorials to a 'T'. So if you can provide a tutorial on how to correct the geometry of the ripped .OBJ models, that'd be great.

These files also apply to Pac Man World Rally and Snoopy vs. the Red Baron, any idea how to open those?

Is there a way to get the 3D data and textures directly from file? I don't like using 3D scene rippers since the model can be distorted.

Ninjaripper's 2.0 version ([https://www.ninjaripper.com/](https://www.ninjaripper.com/)) has the ability to import both Tposed and posed models, undistorted. I've tried it on games that were horribly broken before and I was able to get perfect rips. I started ripping HWWR track models, but their culling system is super jank. Only downside is you have to be a patron to get access to the newest tool.
