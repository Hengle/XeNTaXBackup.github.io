- Post Title: Dark Age of Camelot textures improvement .MPK and .DDS files

Hello everybody 

I tried to improve a bit some armors textures quality in the game Dark Age of Camelot.
Textures are .dds files in .MPK package.
With the DAoC MPAK Package Manager, I extracted and I modified one, reconverted it to .dds, and placed the file again in the .mpk.

But when I launch the game... new textures are just pink.
I thought it was because of the conversion or something like that, so I tried with an another original texture .dds, with just changing the name to replace another one.
And it happened the same thing... pink textures.

Can someone help me with this?
Do you think it is a problem with repackaging the file in the .mpk?
or something else?

thank you a lot for your help!
