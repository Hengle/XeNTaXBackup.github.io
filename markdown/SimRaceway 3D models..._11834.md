- Post Title: SimRaceway 3D models...

Hi, I am interested in extracting 3D models of tracks and cars from SimRaceway.

Now, I found Luigis QuickBMS Script for SimRaceway but donno what files except mas should I put through it, since right now the 3DSimED isn't opening anything when loading scn files to it. Did I miss something?

Also how to open mas files that are used for their cars?

Cheers and thanks

...a lot of things are bad when using 3DRipperDX, I know there is a way to open them in 3DSimED.

3DSimED's website does not list support for SimRaceway  

> Sim formats which can be imported include rFactor2, F1-2013 to F1-2010, NFS Shift, DIRT, GRID,  Race 07, GTR Evolution, STCC The Game, GTR2, rFactor, GTL, GTR,  Papyrus Nascar 2003 & Grand Prix Legends (GPL), Formula 1 2002 (F1 2002).
I recommend to ask your question on the 3DSimED forums, since it's there program, there business

xentax is about 3D research, so unless you want help writing a program then you're asking in the wrong forum

by the way there are no character models in that game, so deformation is not a problem. 3dripperDX should be good enough to get the models out

Game works on rFactor2 engine 

Yeah, no problem, I just asked if someone know why I cannot open those files. That is if someone already did this...

Thanks anyway...
