- Post Title: Wii ADPCM with RIFX header

Hi guys!

This one has buggered me a long time now and I've finally decided to ask for help here. I've worked with the Wii ADPCM format for quite a while now and since the beginning it gave me headaches. I haven't found a working header that I can use as a standard. As an example, I've uploaded some rifx wave files with Wii ADPCM data: [http://www.gamefront.com/files/20933584 ... i_ADPCM.7z](http://www.gamefront.com/files/20933584/RIFX_Wii_ADPCM.7z) 
The decoding coefficients are there but I don't know how to transform these files into playable *.dsp or *.spd (or similar) files.
Any help would be highly appreciated!
Thanks! 

Regards, Timo

It may amuse you to learn that vgmstream has long supported these, simply rename to .wav (or .lwav if you need to prevent Winamp's built-in thingy from grabbing it).

O_o!!!
Ok, that's really hillarious, lol. Didn't know about the *.lwav workaround but now everything's clear. 
Thanks.
