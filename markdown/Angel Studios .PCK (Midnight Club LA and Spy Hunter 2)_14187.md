Hi guys, I've been willing to import/extract some .mesh, .mesh.pck and .psppck files found in MCLA and Spy Hunter 2, but they appear to be compressed. I have attached some pck samples from these games. I'd appreciate if someone can help me out. Thanks!

There is working .mesh importer by Barti here (you can load the vroot_civic_sh_lod_body_h_nonpck.mesh supplied in the archive): [viewtopic.php?p=105226#p105226](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?p=105226#p105226)
