- Post Title: Burnout 3 and Burnout Revenge XWB Support

_EaTrax0.xwb and _EaTrax1.xwb, found in the "Tracks" directory in the popular games Burnout 3 and Burnout Revenge contain all of the music used in the game, which is in .wma form, and encoded at 160Kbit/s, pretty high quality in terms of WMA. Normally, .xwb files come with a similarly named .xsb, which contains important information, such as song name, artist name, and album (as per in-game menu of Burnout 3/Revenge), but it seems that there is no .xsb file in either Burnout 3 or Revenge, so that information is somehow handled seperately, possibly through the file in the Tracks directory "tlist.bin"?.

Even without the .xsb file, though, it'd still be great to have Extractor support for the .xwb file. There have been several EaTrax0/1 extractors written and published on the internet, but most report errors and problems with the extracted music. Fortunately, with a little digging, I found a program that can extract the soundtracks perfectly, with no apparently problems at all. The program is called "unxwb", which I located after searching through the following sites: 
1.) [http://manual.xboxmediacenter.de/wakka. ... GameCodecs](http://manual.xboxmediacenter.de/wakka.php?wakka=XboxGameCodecs)
2.) [http://aluigi.altervista.org/papers.htm#xbox](http://aluigi.altervista.org/papers.htm#xbox)

Whats so good about "unxwb", which is available on that second link (#2), is that it contains the original sourcecode, and is very easy to use.

Since other games that are supported by both MultiEx and WATTO's Extractor have their .xwb listed as readable on the site, it would be excellent if Burnout 3/Revenge was added, and maybe some official support in the extractors, though this really shouldn't be too difficult, since other games have their .xwb archives already supported. Thanks.

I'm not sure what you want, if the .xwb files are already supported, can't you open them as .xwb of the other games? If so, addition of Burnout 3/Revenge is easy. Please let me know.

I'll be sure to check it, sorry its taken a while. I need to re-extract the .xwb from the game, I've already deleted it off my computer because I extracted all the music. Still, it would have been awesome if I didn't have to go about renaming all the files myself.

EDIT: Checked, yeah, the .xwb files open fine with WATTO's Extractor. I'm curious how the game handles their naming information without an .xsb file, though.
