- Post Title: Star Wars Revenge of the Sith Movie Game

I found some subjects on the forums around the files of the Revenge of the Sith game. Has a anyone been able to do anything with the files game? I would love to change the model of the player and change lightsaber? Is this possible or maybe anyone who would help me do this? Thank you. Stay safe.
