- Post Title: DDR X Character Models

Days ago i've heard that some wrote an extractor specifically made for .DAT files from games made by konami
the thing is that i tried to extract some files from some dat files from a ddr game (the japanese version of ddr x to be more precise) but it seems that the extractor doesn't really work with any dat files from any ddr game (atleast the ps2 ones)

An interesting detail is that the arcades also seem to store their data in dat format (models, audio, etc.)

I would be very thankful (im p sure that the ddr community would be glad as well) if someone can find a way do extract stuff from these files ;__;

here's a sample file btw
