- Post Title: Bayonetta 3 PKZ?

Sorry if this is the wrong place, this is my first time creating a post, so if i'm wrong in placement please be kind Y_Y
Okay Hi everyone!
I'm trying to figure out what to do here, I'm a it of a noob but i've been trying to archive and tutorial how to rip animations and materials from games. 
I did a tutorial a while back showing how to get Bayonetta 1 and 2 stuff going.
So when Bayo3 hit, you know we had to jump on that. Get the materials start the extraction process and to my surprise
THEY CHANGED THE FORMAT!
In the previous Bayonettas the materials were in .CPK format.
Now It's in .PKZ T_T

I've never seen PKZ before, I did some research and people said they switched over to PKZ with Astral Chain.
I tried using AC resources to Unpack the B3 PKZ but no success.

Does anyone have any Experience in this format? any advice would be most appreciated and welcomed.
Here is a sample if anyone wants to poke at it.
Thank you so much for your time.

Okay Quick tutorial time for those who maybe stuck.

Step 1 is to extract the B3 romfs, I used Ryujinx since Yuzu wouldn't even entertain the idea of B3.
Step 2: Once the Romfs are extracted you should get a bunch of .PKZ files.
Step 3: Open the B3 tools and use the QuickBMS select the included script when given the prompt
When asked what file to decompress, select every single .pkz file.
follow the instructions and select the export location.
Step4: Once the .PKZ files have been decompressed you'll have a bunch of folders with . DAT and .DTT files.
Step5: Open up the included Noesis from the B3 Tools folder and run the program. I used the normal one instead of the 64 version.
(Side note: Although the folder i included already has the script for B3 included, this is where you can get the updated one, just incase my mega goes the way of the dodo :
[https://github.com/Kerilk/noesis_bayonetta_pc/releases](https://github.com/Kerilk/noesis_bayonetta_pc/releases)
take the .dll and place it inside the plugin folder)

Step6: Select the . Dat folders for the models and animations. Now it is worth noting that you will be prompted to select the animations when it come sup, press ESC and close the prompt. If the animation , textures, bump, are able to display, they will do so automatically. If they don;t then it just wont, there is nothing you did, or can do, that's just how it is.

Use Noesis as normal and export whatcha can, some files dont work again, that's just how it is right now, but who knows what'll change in the future.
Good luck! and keep the shadow Cast!
OH! special thanks to Meonpie and Ekey, for doing that out of the gate research that made this all possible ^_^

You have "some" image (not texture, logo, splash art, ect) in miscTex folder. But I have no idea how to automat the process. They are 6000 file there.
