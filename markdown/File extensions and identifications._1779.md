- Post Title: File extensions and identifications.

I am looking for the file extension site carrying searcheable database of files :by extension, by ID in ASCI and Hex, by keyword. Of course by extension I see many, how about file ID?  Will I be lucky to find one?

Well, while you may have seen many for extension, I'll post this one here anyways, since it's pretty much the holy grail of extension databases: [http://filext.com](http://filext.com).

I'm not sure about tags, but you could try this tool and see if it turns up a match (look for TrID): [http://mark0.net](http://mark0.net).

Good luck!
