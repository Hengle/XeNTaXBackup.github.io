Is there a way to rip models from this game?

I'm looking for Terry Bogard and Nightmare Geese Howard from KOF MI2.

First of All i dont know PC VERSION of this game, but if you have one PC version (not Emulator ps2) upload the files, if you have ps2 version see how to extract the files and post here, its the same way, 3dvia and 3d ripper cant extract T position models.

Look for the taito arcade rips. You can also play KOFXIII.

I downloaded a pack of female models from this game (don't ask for them), you can rip them using some max converter script and game extractor. I don't know how they were ripped, but the file was called "[Megafileupload]KOF-girls.rar" and I got that link from someone at some thread's ripping section, but I just remember the logo had something and dark in it. I found that over 4 months ago, and when I tried to get back to the site, it said it was locked or something, so I can't get back there.


All I know is that Game Extractor can read the KoF:MI models, but I don't know how and I don't know how you can use them (this is just to give you an ideal that it's already possible >_>)

This sounds like this, I found a script to load all the models and i have also all the models of this game here, dont ask by this, but i can remember the models are stored in one treadh i can remember in something page abouth models, anyway i cant keep out the models from the .rar file cause its encrypted all i remember its a something confused flowers and threes.

USEFULL? NA.

Share the files you have and this can be fine.

this was from darkmatter site that is now closed, the files are encrypted but can be decrypted with a maxscript (ask FatDuck for the decompression routine), i decompressed the files with chrrox and 3dhobby fixed the mesh then released the pack on megaupload long time ago...
i will not post the script because FatDuck ask me to not do it when he shared his work.

anyway here are the links to the mesh that you don't want to share with other and just stealed from dm :

this add some costumes

you got inside the maxscript to load the decompressed dff models in max, textures are txd and can be extracted using gta txd viewer (use google)

Maybe Fatduck can share the maxscript to load the decompressed dff, cause this its only woman models.  , other think i see its the models have 100 parts and divided in triangles, to fix this load the textures first, then export to obj back, and import in blender the obj file, then use the blender function in the UV/IMAGE EDITOR-IMAGE-CONSOLIDATE INT ONE IMAGE, export back to obj from blender and replace the file, in the obj export window in blender allow copy image, finally you get the parts are fixed in only 5 or 6 and you have only one texture file for all the model.

Well, here files extracted from the game to test the code writted by fatduck.
All have .pak format.

[http://www.megaupload.com/?d=VR3UQ459](http://www.megaupload.com/?d=VR3UQ459)

Also .ms (MaxScript) Writed by fatduck (doesnt work in Max 9).

[http://gameresearch.5d6d.com/attachment ... 0192&fid=7](http://gameresearch.5d6d.com/attachment.php?aid=232&k=b5af11cfbbd98533d7be88f46ff54705&t=1316730192&fid=7)

If anyone can fix this MS script can be fine.
