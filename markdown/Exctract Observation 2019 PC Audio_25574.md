Holy sheet . 
I finally managed to get the audio Files !! turns out that the files where complied inside the .bank files in the streamingAssets Folder so all I needed to do is use a tool called Fmod Bank Tools . the tool is extracting SFX per each episode since they are separated !

Were you able to locate the voice files for SAM though ?

that was quit a long ago tbh so i don't remember and my HDD is messy as hell but i did extract all of his voices. don't use Fmod there's far more reliable tool out there
