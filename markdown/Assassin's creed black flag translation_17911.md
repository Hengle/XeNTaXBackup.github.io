An amateur translation? Donâ€™t do this! If you need a quality result - use a quality translation tool. All you need to know about [game localization](https://alconost.com/en/services/game-localization) you can find here

I translated this games
Assassins creed 1 (voice and text)
Prince of Persia 2008 (voice and text)
Prince of Persia: The Forgotten Sands (voice and text)
Assassins creed  Unity (text) (i can edit sound files,  but cant repack .PCK files)
Assassins Creed Syndicate (text) (i cant repack .PCK files... But i can edti wem and bnk files)

Now... Who want to care about that?
I can edit assassins creed 3 font, but i cant decompress text and  its posible to edit voice... After all, please someone try to do that, Together We can solve that problem and then, we will able to Translate all of ubisoft Anvil games...

Font is not a problem becuase i can teach a way to inject your ttf file in game with any unicode...
Who want to help...
For now... I can help in sound and those game i said in top of text...
Let's go...

Thanks for answering. How did you extract text from Unity ? I think it is the same files as black flag
