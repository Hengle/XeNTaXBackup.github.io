does not work for me I try to create a 0_.ttarch file for editing my translation but the game does not display the subtitle I have edited ,, I suspect there is a linked file list android_The_walking_dead_301.lua, I tried editing and adding the list 0_.ttarch2 but the game was stuck when i press start episode button, can someone tell me the problem where?
or can someone help me in editing the translation for the android walking dead version?

hope someone can kindly help me, I attach some files that I think are concerned with editing the translation .landb
