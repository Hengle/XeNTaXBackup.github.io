Hi all, i try to get some models of a game, and i know Ninja Ripper is ripping them before the shaders and deformers take effect. My Question is there a way that ninja ripper is catching models i want with shaders i.E. a Character which has body morphs and some make up. Can i rip a scene as i see it on my screen?

Edit: i found almost another way to do this job via Intel GPA. I just have to find out how i can bypass the launcher or login in without this damn launcher. Maybe someone got an idea on this?
