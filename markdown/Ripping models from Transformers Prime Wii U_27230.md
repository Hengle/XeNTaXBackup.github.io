- Post Title: Ripping models from Transformers Prime Wii U

I don't need animations or textures, I just need the models, so it doesn't have to be perfect. Everything I've read seems to imply that getting models out of Wii U games can be tricky however, and not all of them even use the same file types for them. Anyone have any pointers or know how it can possibly be done? I'm a complete newbie to actually getting models out of the game myself, so not entirely sure whether it's even possible with this particular game.
