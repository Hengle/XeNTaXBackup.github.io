- Post Title: Extract stuff from the Dragon Age 2 erf files

Chorrox the forums has already thought of this, but only for 3d models

[viewtopic.php?f=16&t=6119](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=6119)

would someone take up the mantle and finish the script so that it extracts textures/audio as well? I tried to pm him but no answer was given.

I know, we are required to post a sample. but the erf files are too big  but some info on the DA2 erf format is here

thanks

erf files can be textures, models, audio, etc?

erf is the archive that contains everything. the toolset supplied by developers cannot open the DA2 erf file even if the information about compression has been released.

Devilot: You already posted specs of the ERF format. I shouldn't be that hard to create a lib/app, which extracts this format.
