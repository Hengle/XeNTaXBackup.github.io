- Post Title: Any hope for a .m4b file extractor?

Hello all.
I am somewhat new here, but being a fan of Mr. Mouse's work, I decided to join up and post a few Q's.

First off, Id like to congradulate Mr. Mouse on all his work thus far, as well as anyone who participated in assistance for the development of MultiEx commander. Specifically, the TREArchiver for Starwars Galaxies.

Now for my next question.
Is there any chance that a similar program can be developed / modified for Myst 4 Game files? They all appear to be extremely large.
The only clue I had was the zlib.dll in one of the data folders, as well as hints from other coders who claim they extracted .ogg files from the Myst 4 Demo.

Anyone got any ideas?
Mr. Mouse?

I've found a tiny binary file that extracts .m4b files, I can browse everything inside .m4b files even write in .txt files if I need but unfortunately I can't repack back.
