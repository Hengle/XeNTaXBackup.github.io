- Post Title: SAO Re: Hollow Fragment extensionless script files

I'd like to have a tool, that is able to export and rebuild the binary files in the script folder, and all people I had contact with recently have vanished or were unable to contact all of a sudden, so I'm looking for some help here. Mainly I'd need a tool to export the information stored at the end of the files first, preferably in table form so I can copy it into my master sheet for translation, copying everything manually is taking forever... Every help or hint is welcome.
