I'm starting this thread to post work in progress for a live action short film I'm working on using assets from video games like Titanfall, Blacklight Retribution, Hawken, Mass Effect and the like.

Feel free to leave any comments and suggestions on how I can improve the shots for those who know a thing or two about this sort of thing. Always appreciated!

Two quick questions: 

1. Is there a quick effective way of bumping up the resolution/quality of the textures?
2. Anyone know how to rip the game models from the ps4 game, Killzone Shadow Falls? Those models kickass.

Quick facts about these two shots, the models used are from Titanfall. The background image is actually some footage I shot at an abandoned building. I'll be uploading videos of these shots pretty soon, for now I'm just working on getting the images looking good.

Hope you guys like the effort. I'll be posting more as I find time to work on this project.
