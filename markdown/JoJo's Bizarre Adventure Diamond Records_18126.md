Mobile game made with unity engine

Can someone take a look at this archive here? 
[http://www.mediafire.com/file/4iz2wnwn8 ... OJO+DR.zip](http://www.mediafire.com/file/4iz2wnwn8qa8iaq/JOJO+DR.zip)

It seems to be packed or maybe even encrypted. Those files have JJEC header.

Would appreciate any help you can give me.
