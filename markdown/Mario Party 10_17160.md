- Post Title: Mario Party 10

Hello. I have a problem. I want to extract Mario Party 10 Mushroom Park model, and I'm using Random Talking Bush's 3D Max script for BNFM models, but there's an error trying to import bd001_bg00.bnfm, it says: Runtime Error: Face Index Out of Bounds: [49157, 49157, 49157] . I would like some help, for example if there were an BMS script for convert bnfm models to bfres, or something. If you know please tell it. 

And sorry for my very bad english, I'm spanish.

bye!!!

I'll see what I can do to fix that problem sometime later, once I've gotten some other projects finished up and out of the way.
