- Post Title: Ripping 3D Models from Xbox 360 games

So I have an Xbox 360 and I am big into 3D modeling.  I was wondering if their was anyway to extract models from xbox 360 to your PC.  Also I would like to know if they were textured or not.  Thank you for time.

Do you mean, how to backup an ISO or how to extract data from 360?
Don't think there are any nice tools that would allow you to extract arbitrary 360 games.

The games I had in mind were: Halo 3, reach, and 4 when it comes out-Gears of 3, Skyrim.  And i'm not sure what Finale00 meant but I want to extract data of the 3d models that the games i said have. Like the Assault rifle or halos mongoose, stuff like that.  And if possible I would like to also get the textures if possible. I have heard of some ways to do it but not really sure how.
