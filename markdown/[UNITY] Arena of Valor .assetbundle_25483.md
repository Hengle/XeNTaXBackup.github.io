- Post Title: [UNITY] Arena of Valor .assetbundle

This game runs on Unity so it should be a no-brainer to just open its files with AssetStudio. However, the .assetbundle files seem to have some sort of encryption despite the header being seemingly intact, so the software just throws an OutOfRangeException error. The files used to have no encryption a few updates back but that is not the case anymore, unfortunately.



I'm not well versed with encryption so I tried to get the models I wanted with Ninja Ripper as I wouldn't have minded losing the original rigging for these, but the models either come out as a vertex explosion or posed in the animation they were at the time of the capture.

The game is free to download on Google Play Store but I'll leave the samples of a character here in case anyone wants to give it a shot.

Any kind of help is welcomed, thanks for your time.
