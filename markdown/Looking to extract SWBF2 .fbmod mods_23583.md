- Post Title: Looking to extract SWBF2 .fbmod mods

I've read through some threads here on the forum regarding .fbmod files but nothing really explained to me on how to extract them, I've heard there is a private or secret version of frosty that would allow this on another forum but went no where with it.

Up, where can I get that Frosty Tool edit? or some another working extractor? PM please.

2017 game and We can't get the modding files while you have 10 tools for Fallout/Skyrim...Bethesda games for example. That's really no sense.

Maybe there is a way to extract with command prompt? 

Anyway I tried that one BMS script and it sorta worked but the Noesis part was what failed.
