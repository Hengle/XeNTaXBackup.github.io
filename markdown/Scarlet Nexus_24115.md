So i found out it uses 4.27 of umodel  and allows me to extract the textures but not meshes. Also heres the directory to the main character models [https://imgur.com/4Qk5kYt](https://imgur.com/4Qk5kYt)

Hello guys!

I also wanna try extracting models and sounds from Scarlet Nexus as I wanna make mods for another game.

I can't run Unreal Editor but I can use Quickbms. Does anyone know what bms is required to unpack Scarlet Nexus paks?

If anyone can provide me with any information or help, I would appreciate it   .
