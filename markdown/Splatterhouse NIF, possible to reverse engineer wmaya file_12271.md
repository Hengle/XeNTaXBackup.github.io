- Post Title: Splatterhouse NIF, possible to reverse engineer w/maya file?

So I managed to secure quite a few resources from Splatterhouse's original development, namely back when the game was under BottleRocket. That said the vast majority of the files are all in the original maya 8.5 format with the textures alongside, though a few compiled NIF files are also present in here directly next to their source files. Thus far working with maya 8.5 and 2015 managed to get the original models to load, sans their shaders and textures due to missing plugins.

With these resources, would it be possible to reverse engineer a plugin to not only fully read the maya files but also export their data as nifs compatible with the finished game?
