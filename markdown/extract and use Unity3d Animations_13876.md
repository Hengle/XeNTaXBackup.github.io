- Post Title: extract and use Unity3d Animations

Hi guys, I am trying to extract animations from a Unity game.

I do have the asset explorer, so I did extract the .ani files; but Unity does not read the them.

I did try to drag the ani clips in the animator but it won't work; I did create an animation object, but when I drag the ani file on it, nothing happens.

How do you actually extract animations that can then be used in Unity? I see no FBX in the asset file; just ani files.

So it is not possible? Then what is the point of Unity decompilers for resource packages?

For a while now I've tried to get the animations extracted from Unity games, the issue is that they are separated into a file in the resources packages and the actual compiled animation in the DLL files, and even after I decompiled the DLL files and looked through the code I still can't find a way to get them into a usable format.
