Here has decided to write program Wiki Data Base in which there are descriptions of game formats... All too most that on a site [http://wiki.xentax.com](http://wiki.xentax.com) ... The Program has the format of a file in which all to contain descriptions (Game Resource Archive Formats)... The Program still is not added... So I show so to say Release Screenshots

Hey, looks like a great program to me - can't wait to try it out.

You will have to talk to Mr Mouse or Captain about hosting the file or whatever - I don't have any control over this.

Thanks mate - looking good.

Hmm. I would first have to see if I can get Borland C++ somewhere. I understand, with the birth of your son, that you won't have much time on your hands to continue working on it.    

You could perhaps finish it when you have time again? 

Anyway, you can upload or send me the source code by email.

Yes, I noticed they were Delphi files too.   i just assumed they were C. 

Now, who takes on the job to create a release version?

I recieved the source at work, and was stupid not to send it to myself at home. Argh... ! But if Rahly wants to work on a release version, I will send it when I get back to my offcice.

We can host the files. Mr. Mouse is busy with his stuff, and I don't know Delphi. What's the problem with sharing the source for everyone so somebody else might improve on it?

Its a good project, I donno, because I don't have any source code, so i can't work with it.  I wouldn't think so because there is a perfectly good web interface.  If anything, i would work on that rather than a downloadable program, and just allow the user to get a .ZIP/.RAR of the current wiki. If you do finish it, allow the program to "sync" to the wiki.  I think a kewler program would be to generate headers for multiple languages directly through the wiki. a .h for a c program,  .pas for a pascal program. etc etc

I also have an idea for Mr Mouse, update Mexcom THROUGH the wiki 

I also still have to work on plugins.  Since requirements have changed for them @MrMouse
