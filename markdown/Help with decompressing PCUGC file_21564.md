Hi guys, could you help me figure out what compression method Frontier is using in their PCUGC files? It should contain an FBX model, PNG files and info about the UGC item. It seems that most of the info about the item is stored in plain text, but there are some weird compressed bits muddled in between.

Change the file extension to .zip. It is essentially a ZIP file.

Damn, didn't even notice that. Any help with getting data out of the OVL files? I aim to edit the model scale, and then pack it back into the PCUGC file in order to bypass the developers 8x8x8 model size restriction.

edit: I believe all the model data is stored within the UGCOVL#####.ovl file. I only really aim to edit the vertex placements so I can scale up my models ingame.
