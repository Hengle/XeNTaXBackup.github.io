Hi there!

This is an addon for Blender 2.8+ that lets you load models from "Monster Hunter Stories 2: Wings of Ruin".



Installing Blender add-on:
Go to Edit -> Preferences, click on "Add-ons" tab on the left. You'll find in the top menu "Install...". Drive to "seca_mhs2wor.zip" file and enabled it.

You can convert textures directly while loading models, just copy "texconv.exe" inside "archive" folder from the game.

I'll update the tool with support for all models and other features.

How to use "arc_tool.py":
ORIGINAL SCRIPT FROM SILVRIS
[https://github.com/Silvris/MH-Tools-and-Scripts](https://github.com/Silvris/MH-Tools-and-Scripts)
1.- Run "arc_tool.py"
2.- "root.txt" will be generated.
3.- Edit "root.txt" and write the complete path to "archive" folder. (Usually "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Monster Hunter Stories 2\nativeDX11x64\archive" in windows)
4.- Save it.
You can easily drag files into the application or drag and drop a folder containing the ARC files. Keep in mind all ARC files in subfolders will be extracted!! Total size of extracted assets is more tha 23GB.

An Update is available, just tick "Check update" while you're loading a model and restart Blender, if you already have it installed. Alternatively, you can download this new version.

Thanks for this script.

I ran it in batch to import and convert all the .mod models.

Of the 8623 models, 272 failed to import.
There were a few different errors, attached is a list of the models that did not convert.

The model ripping utility works great, but in terms of the included "texconv.exe" I haven't been able to get it to work, even once. It just quickly flashes through its initial prompt and closes. I'm mainly mentioning this because other tools haven't been able to touch certain texture file types used for things like clothes yet, and I'm not sure if this one could yet or not.

Yo, is there a way to convert it back into the .mod file?

If you haven't been able to get it to work, it's because you aren't following my steps. Try to place "texconv.exe" in the right folder, please, else explain a little bit what you're doing to know what's wrong or try to contact me on Discord

Hi.
Have you found a way to convert it back to a .mod file yet?

The saddles aren't part of the monster models. They're stored in \nativeDX11x64\archive\mod\sd

I had a poke around, and the IDs are as follows:
sd000 through sd021 are all leftover from stories 1 and have 256x256 textures.
sd100 - Rathalos-inspired saddle used by riders from Mahana, including the player, Kayna, and Red
sd101 - modeled after Kushala Daora and can be seen on the sleeping Paolumu in Rutoh, as well as on Alwin's Legiana.
sd102 - Nergigante-based saddle used by the mysterious riders you fight at various points during the story. Seems to be made of bone.
sd103 - visually identical to sd100, likely used by Kayna on Avmar due to the fact it's grouped with the rest of the battle buddy saddles.
sd104 - identical to sd101. Alwin's saddle, worn by Shaulk.
sd105 - Avinia's saddle. Matches her clothes, worn by Frostfang.
sd106 - Cheval's saddle. High-resolution version of a blue Hakum rider saddle, worn by Rathi.

There is no exe, its 100% python, python tools don't have exe's.
You might need to install python.
For the second part of the script,run the script through Blender.

Hi,

I'm pretty new at this and am trying to get this tool working. I am currently stuck trying to run the 'arc_tool.py' script in Blender (assuming I am doing it correctly).

I am getting the following error:

Python: Traceback (most recent call last):  File "\arc_tool.py", line 15, in <module>ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'Crypto'

I can literally see when the script first runs that Crypto and pycryptodome folders are created in the Python roaming folder. Trying to troubleshoot this I have also run a fresh installation of pycryptodome via pip command. Unfortunately the results are the same.

I would be grateful for any guidance provided.

When I've exacted some of the monster's models, the skeleton doesn't line up with the actual model and is using a different default (T-) pose, messing up the weights entirely. Is there any way I can fix this or is this how models are normally extracted?

Hi,

I followed the instructions like this:

- installed and enabled the "seca_mhs2wor.zip" add-on in Blender (v.3.0.0)

- put "texconv.exe" in the archive folder of the game

- ran the "arc_tool.py" script and put the path to the games archive folder in the generated "root.txt" file

But dragging the .arc files or folders to Blender seems to do nothing. Even if i try to do "File->Import->Monster Hunter Stories 2" None of the .arc files show up in the game's folders. I wonder what i'm doing wrong and i'd love if someone could help me find a solution.

Is this thing even supposed to work? Because when I drag and drop it into my notepad or blender, despite following all the directives, nothing shows up. Not even an error.

The instructions on this are really bad and the texconv step doesn't work, and just replying, "put it in the right folder   " when people are having problems is not helpful at all, tested the addon in multiple versions of blender 2.8 and it does nothing with the arc files despite having an option called "Extract ARC". The plugin only opens .mod files for the 3d models.

Now for anyone who is confused.

if you are just learning how to mod games, this game stores its assets in .arc files, you need to extract them to be able to use them.
the arc_tool.py script extracts the files, but the script doesn't run in blender, if its supposed to, it just doesn't work. 
you have to download python and install it, right click on the arc_tool.py script, go to properties, and set .py files to open with python like in this: 

Doing it in any other way doesn't work, you'll get a "SyntaxError"'

After the script runs the first time it will create a root.txt file inside the same folder where the script is located, open root.txt and type the path to your games "archive" folder and save.
Mine looks like this:


To extract the arc files run the arc_tool.py one more time and it will ask you to type the folder you want to extract, you can check the names in your "archive" folder but most of you probably want the monsters and NPC models, the folder that has all those is called "mod":

type the folder name and hit enter, it should start extracting all the files.

when you are done extracting the files, the assets will be stored in your games archive folder, the 3d models are .mod files, to open them in blender go to file>import and you should see a monster hunter stories 2 option if the addon is active.

The textures are .tex files but you need to convert them to use them

use this instead of the texconv step:
[https://github.com/Silvris/MHS2-Tex-Converter](https://github.com/Silvris/MHS2-Tex-Converter)

drag and drop a .tex on top of the MHS2-Tex-Converter.exe to convert the .tex to .dds

to open .dds files in photoshop you'll need this plugin: [https://github.com/GameTechDev/Intel-Te ... /ITW_1.0.4](https://github.com/GameTechDev/Intel-Texture-Works-Plugin/releases/tag/ITW_1.0.4)
