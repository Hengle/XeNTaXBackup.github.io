- Post Title: Virtual Tennis 2009 (PC) .xpac

So this is a little request. Help to unpack *.xpac file from Virtual Tennis 2009. I want trying to convert 3d models, and believe that model format similar to Virtual Fighters 5.

[other.xpac](http://www.mediafire.com/?t36t3buaxjaa9q2) - small file [about 4 mb]
[minigame.xpac](http://www.mediafire.com/?1phbvyzu34oa1e4) - big file [about 30 mb]
