- Post Title: with this software you can collect over 20000 models !

"3D Object Converter", a powerful 3d model translation and interactive viewing shareware tool that allows arbitrary 3d model data to be imported from external sources, exported to various industry standard 3d file formats with great accuracy and quality. The program supports 537 file formats. It is available for Windows95/98/Me/NT/2K/2003/XP 32/XP 64/Vista 32/Vista 64.
-------------------------------------------------------------------
this software can convert 3d files that used in some games like crysis,farcry,painkiller... to other formats (508 format) like 3ds I tried it . that is realy good because it can batch convert 1000s models and is't necessary to manualy work with each files .
MY idea is that we must support the creator of this programme to include more games to it like "half life","left for dead",and other games that their files decoded with some tools but that tools usually can work only with one files and for persons decided to collect all of models this tools are not excellence !
DO YOU AGREE WITH ME ?

Thanks for sharing this!

However looking at the supported Formats list, it seems like alot of modern day titles aren't supported, which is a shame   
The only 2 big titles i can find are the ones you mentioned, Crysis and Painkiller.
I know there are other programs out there to do these things, but even the Half Life MDL format isn't supported, and while the SMD format is, that is defeating the purpose because the SMD is what is compiled into a .MDL ...

I downloaded the program none-the-less, as it will be an invaluable asset to my Swiss Army Knife of tools

Yes 1, It's a plugin for Milkshape 3D but i'm not sure if it can do batch or not...

That's for Half Life 1 engine... umm your better off downloading the HLSDK (v2.3 or something) because it comes with all of the model sources that Valve used to compile the MDLs...  

Ok i just double checked, Milkshape comes with the plugin "Kratisto's Half Life MDL Decompiler" but it only supports 1 file at a time   , i strongly suggest getting The HLSDK which as mentioned above comes with all the Model sources..  

Milkshape is here [http://chumbalum.swissquake.ch/ms3d/download.html](http://chumbalum.swissquake.ch/ms3d/download.html)

HL SDK 2.3 is here [http://games.on.net/file/358/Half-life_SDK](http://games.on.net/file/358/Half-life_SDK)

As for Half Life 2, there is only 1 decompiler that i know of, and believe me i've searched for others (with batch support)
That's [http://www.chaosincarnate.net/cannonfod ... mpiler.php](http://www.chaosincarnate.net/cannonfodder/mdldecompiler.php)

Version 0.5 will support most HL2 engine games, including mods.
However for something like Team Fortress 2, you need to download the older version, Version 0.4.1 in order to decompile its models.

For something like Left 4 Dead, well i won't go into detail, but Alot of work needs to be done in order to decompile those models

Hope this helps,

So do i !

The only way i know of, is to use a Windows Macro to do this.. I have not been able to get it working but i tried for a long time to write a macro to batch decompile models (For left 4 dead) but failed.
I tried using VB script, then a program called AutoIt (which has a GUI for creating macros)

I think Cannonfodder is the only person on this planet to successfully write a HL2 Model decompiler 
He hasn't been active in a long time from my knowledge

hey jenx , what is your idea about using of command arguments instead Windows Macro ?
the developer of crafty told : 

> Hidden Features:
>
>

> Crafty is designed foremost as an object viewer, but it also contains several useful features that can be invoked externally. For example, Crafty's File System Browser, Material Browser and Model Browser can all be invoked with special command arguments. To view one or more packages in File System Browser simply use: Crafty.exe -fsb -mount [package 1] -mount [package 2] ... . To view one or more packages in Material Browser simply use: Crafty.exe -msb -mount [package 1] -mount [package 2] ... . To view one or more packages in Model Browser simply use: Crafty.exe -mb -mount [package 1] -mount [package 2] ... . For example, if you wanted to view thumbnails of the materials in source materials.gcf you would use Crafty.exe -msb -mount "source materials.gcf". If you are familiar with Windows you can also add shortcuts to these features in the system context menu.

is it possible , it has a Hidden command arguments that help us for batch process ! at least in an indirect way ?
but i dont know how can list all command arguments that may accepted by a netfamwork application ?
