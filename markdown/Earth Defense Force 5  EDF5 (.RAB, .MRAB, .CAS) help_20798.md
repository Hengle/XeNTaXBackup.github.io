Has anyone looked into cracking these files open?

[Some 4.1 files from the Xentax forum (old post).](https://www.dropbox.com/s/vkbgndrr8yart5h/MENUOBJECT.7z?dl=0&file_subpath=%2FMENUOBJECT)

The game uses .CPK files, which can be extracted with CriPakTools. I can extract the models and textures with Ninja Ripper. However, the UV maps don't seem to rip with it, so the textures don't apply correctly.

Possible file relations:
. SGO - game data file
- MRAB/RAB/CAS(animation?) - 3D models
- SHKT - textures?

Have you made any progress with getting all the models/UV Maps and textures? I'm looking to make a fangame with them!
