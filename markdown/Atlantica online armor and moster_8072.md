I can open all characters and see them. I dont see textures because they are coded, need to convert them but I see models. You must probably update nifskope

It may be a setting in nifskope that is not showing the mesh properly...

npc, monsters and heroes are all in the same folder I think. When it comes to weaps I see textures on them and you can extract them in nifskope, others you need to convert and it is easy if you know hex but otherwise a little hard.

You have to copy the beginning of a real dds texture and paste in the the texture of atlantica

In later versions of Atlantica they changed some things. There were added a lot of new creatures and objects, but all of them uses version 2.6 of gambryo engine, that is afaik cannot be wathed by nifscope or max plugin.
Also in some of the old meshes changed animation files, and even some old model files have changed too, again new ones uses 2.6 version and cannot be imported.
So till the niftools doesn't support this engine version it's better to find old Atlantica client version if you want to use models.

I can confirm that the client I posted works very well with nifskope, of course it does not have all the latest models but quite many

I need to edit this. The client is a closed beta from beginning of 2008 but still there are alot of 2.0.6 characters so not all will be able to be viewed in current nifskope. I found a python converter for the dds files. I just drag and drop the dds files onto the python so it basically converts a whole folder immediatly

20.3's from this game.
There's no guarantee that two models from the same version of the game engine have the same format.

The ones you uploaded are from 20.2.0.8g_as, whichever version that is.
Which would be useful also, but I want to see if my script can load the 20.6's
