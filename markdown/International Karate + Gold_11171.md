- Post Title: International Karate + Gold

Hi, let this be the first post about a mod for an ancient computer game, International Karate +. 
This game used to be two-player only (two joystick ports on a Commodore 64), but was modded to allow three-players to compete at once (instead of the third player always being the CPU).
