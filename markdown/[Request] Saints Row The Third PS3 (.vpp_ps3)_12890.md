- Post Title: [Request] Saints Row The Third PS3 (.vpp_ps3)

Any way to extract them? I'm trying to get some textures (stored as .DDS) and can't find any tool that deals with them 
Also managed to decrypt the .sdat ones witn npdtool so they have same header as .vpp_ps3 ones.

Gibbed's tools only extracts few dummy files and then crashes.
