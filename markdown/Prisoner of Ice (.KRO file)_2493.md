- Post Title: Prisoner of Ice (.KRO file)

Hi my friends. 
First i want to apologize for my bad english   
Second, i want to thanks for your great work at this project! MultiEx Commander is amazing!

I am looking for a way to extract subtitle texts from the game Prisoner of Ice, translate it to brazilian-portuguese and reinsert the translated text back.

After many research, i had no luck in finding a tool to do that. I also did not found any document that explains this game file format. The only information i could found is:
1. All the voice acting and subtitle texts appears to be in the file E_KLANG.KRO.
2. i read on another forum that the .KRO file is a compressed file that uses a modified version of zlib, but i don't know if this is true.

I made a sample of the file using the filecutter posted on this forum, so i hope it can help.
The sample made with filecutter can be downloaded here (1mb):

Im also uploaded the entire E_KLANG.KRO to my website, you can download it here (31,10mb):

I hope anyone can help me to figure out how work with this file.

Thanks to all! I hope I can help this wonderful work in the future!
