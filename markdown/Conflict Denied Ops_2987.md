Hey there! I'm wondering if there is any way to see the textures from the game Conflict Denied Ops or its model. Actually what i've find in the data folder are some files containing each level. for example:

m_oil.pc (DAT file)
m_oil.pc (SCH file)
m_oil.pc (DLL file)

And like that with each level. The smaller of these files is 200mb or such, so its hard to upload. anyway, here is the demo:

I dont know anything about all this stuff of files and such, but i like to learn

The files are really big at all. 100mb the smaller one, and the max goes to 300mb :/
