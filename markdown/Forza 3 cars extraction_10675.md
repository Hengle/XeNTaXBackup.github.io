Hello! I want to extract the cars from forza 3 for xbox 360. I did it before like 3 month ago, but now i don't know how to do it anymore.
On my cd are only these files: [http://imageshack.us/a/img826/6522/aoao.jpg](http://imageshack.us/a/img826/6522/aoao.jpg)
I know tha before i used forza studio to unpack the files if i'm not wrong. 
I search here on the website but i can't find how exactly to extract the cars.
Could please somebody help me?
