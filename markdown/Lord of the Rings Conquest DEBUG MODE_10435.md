- Post Title: Lord of the Rings: Conquest DEBUG MODE

Hello people) So I have tried to extract 3d models from this game with 3dripper DX, it wasn't that bad-almost perfect))) but there were few locations i couldn't get (i mean it was too high, or there were big walls etc.), few weeks ago saw interesting screen shot with game-it was launched in debug mode (there was flying mode). And now the problem itself-i have no idea how to launch it in debug mode, I mean I know how it suppose to be-you just need to type  -debug or -devmode, -dev etc. at the shortcut options so it would be for example like that      (/path to the game/lotr.exe" -debug) . But it won't start in debug mode. If anyone has any idea what did i do wrong and how start it in debug-that would be great    Sorry for my english ))) and thanks in advance.
