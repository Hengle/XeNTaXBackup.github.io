I'm already on it, I have some working demo stuff but there is enough differences in the float structures that only a hand full of the models make it through without crashing max. I will have to relook at the way the offsets are handled in the new files.

Ah thank you for a swift reply.
It's great to know that you're already on it and hopefully will make a working version for TFU2 
Cheers, I appreciate your hard work.

--DANGIT, beat me by 3 hours. One day I will figure something out first on this site, one day. 

@ Zerovisibilite

--Does this decrease the time it will take you to crack this code or were you already aware of this and it makes no difference in that regard? Thanks, love your tool.----Err, wait, not like that buddy

It appears as though it is only the models that were in part 1 that are able to be extracted with the tool.

No, the models that are new have different heads on the Vert Count and Face Count. These are models that were ported over from the olds game to use in the new. They will go through but like you see dome stuff just don't make it. The head was remodeled and anythin(most) new models will return 0 models found

Ah, thanks for the revelation. But as said above, only the stuff that was ported over from TFU1 works, new things like head meshes and completly new models etc don't convert.
I hope you can make an updated version of the ripper soon

Can you share a file that wasn't ported from the first game then?
I don't think the Starkiller Classic model displayed in my previous post is a good example of geometry not coming through the converter since there was no texture for the head included in the files provided unless you removed it prior to uploading. This indicates that the geometry wasn't there to start with but was being pulled from another gto file by the game engine so the developers didn't have to waste precious space by storing the same geometry over and over in multiple files which i thought was a benefit of using the gto format but this is purely speculation.

Yeah no problem, I'll upload it tomorrow since where I'm at atm I haven't got access to TFU2. Check this post tomorrow for links to a couple of non-ported-over models.

The point is to update the ripper to support TFU2 models, it doesn't work with any of the models made for TFU2.
It only works with the ones they ported over from TFU1.

Besides I've been asked to supply models that aren't TFU1 ports, so I did.

Yes, yes. Sorry. I misread your post at first and I did not read the request post. AND I thought you were posting that to me, haha. That is strike three for me in one post. I.B.Dumba. So much so I wish to erase it from history. SEE ABOVE


EDIT---No, I did not misread your post, so long as my use of the word port is the same as yours. But I did miss the request for it. Either way, my bad. But, by "port", you simply mean that it was a model in 1 that they placed into 2, right? I think I foolishly assumed that the crimesolvers on the gto case all HAD the game and, therefore, all of the files. But now I am thinking that there are probably too many games to download or buy(?#@?) or they simply dont giv a shiv about it, only the code to crack, so f an 8GB file.

Yeah it's a request of mine to the people that made the original GTO Ripper for TFU1.
I hope the talented people here can figure out and make a version compatibile with TFU2 models.
TFU2 has 2 different types of gto's.
Some seem to be using different offsets or something for the model data and that's the case with all the models made for TFU2.
The models ported over from TFU1 (As in, they took the original GTO's from TFU1 and simply put it in TFU2 to avoid more work) work fine.

Hopefully you guys can make a TFU2 compatibile version of the GTO Ripper

The gto formats are the same.  GTO does not use file offsets, never has.  Assuming the data is laid out in a consistent structure between models may get most of the files to work when that turns out to be correct, but as seen causes problems when the files don't.

Glad to see the progress.  i don't have access to any way to make changes to the current tools, or give any more information on why they don't work, but i may look into coding up the format specs i posted as well if i can make time for it.

Haven't gotten around to looking into the animation format fully like i wanted, but the information posted previously on the format was a good start from what i did get a chance to look at.

Will have to see if can get to working on the other data.

The LOD files usually contain the parts that are missing from the main gto file, just combine the different parts to make a whole character.

AceWell, none of those files convert for me.
Not a single one, it gives me a runtime error/no models found when I run it on them.

I'd really like to request the ripper you use at the moment, because clearly I seem to have some outdated version.

On a side note, yes I know the real .gto files need to be unpacked first out of the fake ones.

Rename first the gto file to rar then extract the file you will have a file 
without termination just rename the file to gto and the converter will
work.

You have to change your Windows regional settings, if your problem persists with all converted models which you try to import into max.
Go to windows -> Control Panel -> Regions and settings -> Additional Settings (bottom button).
In the Regional Settings of Windows, the Decimal separator must be set to "." instead of "," so that, when one use the GTO Ripper, data in OBJ files are written with "." (ie "1.20" instead of "1,20") so the import plugin should correctly recognize the vertex coordinates of the mesh .

Try to use GTO ripper, it should work fine now.

Wow... now it works perfectly, thank you very much.
What about textures for the model???
how could I apply all them to the model??? I found them but i can apply only one a time ad it's ORRIBLE!!!    nothyng like the original model!!! Even if I used the Multi/Sub-Object to apply more then one texture it apply only one!!!  
Tante grazie!!!xD   
So i looked at UVW and it's a confused mix of line!!! 

p.s.: if anyone have Rahm kota can give the model to me??? I haven't got the pc version of the games... i've the x-box one so I cant extract the models!!!
Thanks again

I have been trying to get what I can of models out of Star Wars Force Unleashed 2 but I'm getting an error with the converter I can't resolve.  Could anyone help.  I've taken the model folder for playerultimateevil and changed the .gto file > changed the extension to .rar and extracted that > then tried to extract that with the converter but it has an error of the following:

Run-time error '6':

Overflow

Could anyone assist?

Again i'm trying to figure out if you can get the character models RIGGED and TEXTURED out.  I've been able to assemble a few of the static meshes and put them in the cryengine but I'm trying to see if I can't get some of the hero models from cinematics.  Any help would be truly appreciated!
