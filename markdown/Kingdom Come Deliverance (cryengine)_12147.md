Has anyone got a .pak decrypt for this? I have the old decrypts for Crysis 2/3 + other Cryengine games, but i don't know how to get 'key' from them.

Kingdom Come Deliverance was released today.


Alternatively, could anyone point me in the right direction on how to find the rsa key?

RSA key must be in WHGame.dll.

Kingdom Come is unencrypted. Just unarchive with winrar.

have you tried the zip.bms. With the new reimport function without the size limit, you can rebuild it without problems, at least works in Crysis 3, and if the subtitles files, you can use AkelPad.

Sorry for the necro!

The pak files open with zip directly (no bms needed)
The latest version of cgf-converter converts everything I tested.

This is from the latest version of the game
