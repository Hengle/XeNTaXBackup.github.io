- Post Title: Files not appearing in explorer

So I'm having an odd problem.
I'm running on winXP .

On some applications, when I want to create a new directory or save a new file, they are created successfully but I can't see it in windows explorer.

So for example I might run filecutter and the output file should appear in the same folder as the input, but when I go there I don't see it. I try saving it on the root drive but it doesn't show up. In a folder, doesn't show up. Although when I save it on the desktop it shows up.

All of these are when I look for it using explorer.
When I'm working with 010 editor and save a file in some folder, it doesn't show up on explorer, but in 010 editor open dialog I can see it.

Though, when I'm working with notepad++ and save a file/create folder, the issue does not occur. So it's not like it's an issue with all programs.

Not sure what the issue might be. Any ideas?

I'm also not sure when this started. I recently installed avast, but it hasn't been giving me any notifications so I'm not too sure if that might be a problem. I see it has a bunch of "shields" like a file shield that scans stuff before writing, but turning it off temporarily doesn't seem to make a difference.

I get this now and then with Win7, Vista, and Win XP.
(To many systems running on My Network)
I think it may have something to do with the indexing or something.
I've never found a real solution except to reboot.
I use AVG Free so I doubt it's Avast.

Hopefully a restart will make all those files show up.
It's strange that it's just explorer that doesn't see it.

Maybe I should just find an alternative.

I've also wondered if it's the power settings on things?
Several of the HD's on this system are set to power down when I'm not accessing them.
So if I save to or try to open a file on them? I get a delay.
It's a PITA at times, but I can suffer that for a longer life on them. (I Hope!)

Well this is interesting. 

I moved the file from 010 editor's open dialog into my documents (G:\My Documents) and the file showed up, though if I put it back to the folder that I originally saved it to (G:\Image) it doesn't show up.

I moved it under G:\, and it also showed up.
Though when I moved it around and around and tried to move it back to G:\, it then told me that I couldn't move the file for whatever reason.

Seems like certain folders are being affected while others are not.
If I save it to my documents or desktop they would show up fine. And they're on the same hard-disk as well.
