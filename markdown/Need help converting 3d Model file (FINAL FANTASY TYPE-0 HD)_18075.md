- Post Title: Need help converting 3d Model file (FINAL FANTASY TYPE-0 HD)

Hi,

Most of the work is done, I think, but since I don't have any knowledge about coding or programming, I don't know what to do with these.

So, these are what I have (you can find all of that in this xentax thread viewtopic.php?f=10&t=13224):

- Decompressed model files in .bin format: Example [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1uNPcr5hg_CxC9z7DOmsRofitNvAGetI5/view?usp=sharing).
- Model structure template (info only): Post #4 of the above topic.
- How to open the bin file in 3d Software by EcheloCross:

> if you convert that binary template to any language most of the work is done. The models are grouped into separate meshes inside the model files, the textures reside near the end of the file and their info is in the toc. They're dx10 textures so I had to convert them with texconv after extracting them. Then I wrote all the vertex, uv, and face info to a .obj and referenced the textures in a .mtl. There are also material definitions in the file telling which texture to use for each group of faces.

The problem is, I don't have a clue how to "convert that binary template to any language", because I don't know any.
I tried Model researcher for days but still haven't figure anything out.

Is there anyone that can help me? Please, and thank you in advance!

Anyone? I finished translate this game into my mother language just a couple of days ago. And I really want these models to make extra contents promoting for the game and encouraging ppl to buy it.
