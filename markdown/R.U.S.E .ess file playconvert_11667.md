Hi

I extract R.U.S.E game archives and find .ess audio files.

I can't find any player or converter for this files!

I've made some research on this. Interesting algorithm. Anyone still need to decode this format?

Yeah, I'm interested. The more formats that are decodable the better IMO

ESS file decoded for the very first time!   

Its only one channel, and some glitches because of probably some errors in decoding, but they will be eliminated soon.

I only need to handle the final frame, which is usually shorter, and it will be ready

First release. Only STEREO files! Don't try it with mono.

Feel free to test it on all games using this crazy ESS format.
