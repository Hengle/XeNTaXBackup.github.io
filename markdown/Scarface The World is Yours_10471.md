- Post Title: Scarface: The World is Yours

Hello Xentax, 

I'm having trouble with Scarface: The World is Yours. I was able to extract the sound (.ogg) files from the RSD's using Scarface Extractor but for the hell of me I can't find any of Tony Montana sound clips. The sound library seems to be incomplete and only contains a few Tony Montana voice clips. (mostly mission-related, and even then it's only a few of his voice clips).   Most of it is police radio or music. 

If anyone knows where to get all of Tony's voice clips please tell me. I have looked everywhere but can't find them.   

Thanks,
Brian.
