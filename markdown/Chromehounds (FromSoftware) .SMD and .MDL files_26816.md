- Post Title: Chromehounds (FromSoftware) .SMD and .MDL files

I've recently been on a kick to relive my favorite childhood games and I've been fixated on Chromehounds for a bit now. I really wanna view the online only parts that are present in the game but now unable to be seen due to the servers being shut down a long time ago.

So far I've been able to open the .bnd's with Yabber ([https://github.com/JKAnderson/Yabber](https://github.com/JKAnderson/Yabber)) and I've gotten the .smd and .mdl files which seem to be the models (.smd is for sure as I've seen it be extracted on a previous thread: [viewtopic.php?t=17572](https://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?t=17572)) 

All I know so far is that these formats are originally based on others like from Source but have been modified enough by FromSoftware that they are not compatible with any methods of viewing or opening the original .mdl and .smd file types. 

It does seem possible to use Hex2Obj to open these but I'm so terrible at figuring out how that work's that it would take me ages just to get a single file properly modeled.

Does anyone have any ways to actually view these file types? I'm really looking for anything I can find to get that nostalgia back, I desperately miss this game lol.

Anyways, I've updated the thread you linked to with the parameters for the mdl version of LG_TL062.

If there's truly no other option that might have to be what I gotta do but man looking at a lot of the hex stuff is like staring into the Matrix, I just can't even begin to comprehend it at the moment lol. Really appreciate the work you've done so far though I'd be completely lost without it.

I made a plugin for Noesis [.*smd/*.mdl]
