Hi!
Is there anybody who knows anything about these files? The game stores everything in them, except music and voiceovers.

don't worry if you receive an error with some of the big archives

Can you help me please? When i try to reimport the files. It gives me "script invalid for reimporting, it uses MEMORY_FILEs" error, then exit.

No, there is nothing to do.
It's a limitation of the reimport technique with content that is not located inside the original archive (memory_files are like temporary files).
