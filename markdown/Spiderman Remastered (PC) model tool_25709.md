What is the process behind converting .model to .ascii?

Just drag the .model onto the .exe to convert.
Hello daemon. Curious if there will be a .texture support in the future perhaps? Seems like the models got a makeover with the pc version and as an artist it would be nice to get texture support for these new models

Real Quick Question: If we had edited a model, how would we be able to convert it back into a .model file for putting it in the game as a mod? If theres any way to do that, i mean.

After all the tests, I decided to release my custom model import tool, because it seems it will be very useful for the community. Before release I will try and add a few more most important features to it, such as multi-mesh support, and then release it.

Then I plan to look into PS4 Peter's head and see if it will be possible to port it to PC.

custom skeletons may be supported later.
Right now models have to be rigged beforehand with one of existing game skeletons. For example, player skeleton like on the pictures.

Custom model import tool v0.3 beta

It INJECTS geometry/skin data from ascii to model.

Usage:  spiderman_pc_mi.exe <model> <ascii>

The model used is just a template for injection. It better be original advanced suit (hero_spiderman_body.model), because i only tested it, as it has lots of materials and many vertices. After you mod it, you can replace any model with it. Also you CAN try other suits, but no guarantee.

It will also output a "check" ascii, which is a passthrough to make sure it work or not, also that ascii will have a list of materials used for reference.

Thank you so much for this!

Is it possible to export .ascii with more than 4 weights per vertex? For game mesh edits.

EDIT: What I mean is, some weight data is lost when porting back a mesh from the game. If I convert the .model I created and import it in Blender, all vertices show only up to 4 weights.

First of all, as i said, this was supposed to be my own test tool, that i made for reversing/testing needs, so i'm not surprised people are struggling with using it.

About materials.

Its different things, if you want to change existing model, or create a new one. I didnt expect people trying to use the tool this way.
The materials in the new model are assigned in natural order: 0, 1, 2, 3, etc
While in existing model they are assigned in the order devs did it. For example, for advanced suit its: 13, 10, 14, 7, 4, ...
Thats why it looks like they are "messed up".

4 weights is not the limit of the format. I just did first experiments with 4 to avoid possible problems. But when yesterday i tried to add more, i messed up something in my code, and it ruined the skin. So since i had no time to investigate the issue, i just reverted back to 4 for this beta release.

Thanks for the clarification. In the mean time, I'll try to limit my own models to 4 weights per vertex.

if I use this new version of the tool alone as a CMD it crashes the game upon loading a save
but if I use it with the GUIWrapper the game will not crash but instead suffer from very poor fps (around to 1-5 fps)

Version 0.41 beta

- LOD problem fixed again
- test output .ascii from model import tool now has "modout" suffix, to not confuse it with clean .ascii file
- added check for maximum vertex/face counts, in case of overflow tool stops with a message
- fixed some rare models (for example iron spiders legs)
- removed "face fail" message, we dont need it anymore
- direct material assignment on import

This last feature will be described in details below.

Direct material assignment
=========================================
In short, new export tool now exports text material list, and you can edit this file, and it will be used on import. Now if you just export any model and import it back, it will work, and materials will not be changed.

So the process is now:

- export .model with new spiderman_pc_model.exe
- edit the model or make a new one
- edit materials list
- use spiderman_pc_mi.exe tool as before

Now on a last step, if there is "materials.txt" file with same name as .model file, import tool will assign materials to meshes according to that list. Or if no such file, in natural order like before.

If you dont want to re-export a model, you can make such material list in text editor.
You can edit this file as you like, but don't delete the 1st line "Materials used:".
For convenience, you can delete lines, or move them above/below. Names are not needed, you can just set numbers. The tool only reads numbers in first list, everything else is ignored. Slots in 2nd list are only for reference.

Note that materials can repeat.

p.s. if  blender will still somehow mess up meshes order, you will have to rename them, but hopefully this will not happen, because tool now names them with leading zeroes and without underscore.

Version 0.45 beta

- supports up to 15 weights per vertex
- added a check for ovefloating weight buffer

The tool will now read all no-zero weights from the file, but no more than 15.
Then it will check weight sum is 1.0, and if not, make warnings.
After that all weights will be automatically normalized.

That means even if you're lazy, model will look ok in game.
But for experts i recommend to check what's wrong and correct it before import.

With cmd how do you inject a materials.txt file? I made it the same name as the model but it didn't work. Does the program automatically find it if it's the same name as the model, but has "_materials" at the end and in the same location? Or is it suppose to be something like this - "spiderman_pc_mi.exe hero_spiderman_body.model new_model.ascii hero_spiderman_body_materials.txt"

Depending what python script for importing the ASCIIs you have it can be either Noesis, or Blender. Blender recommended though, unless your talking about the import tool back in the game then is the one with *_mi.exe at the end.

Version 0.5 beta

- fixed all crashes / fps drops / lags
 (may even fix other unknown bugs/problems)
- submesh limit is now much bigger, all lods instead of just one. Example: 89 submeshes for adv. suit

Everyone is HIGHLY recommended to update their mods done with previous versions of a tool.
Already modded .model will do, but better used on clean original .model file.

i just want to know how to add the textures i tested things but no luck
don't know how to add textures to the model is there a tutorial for the whole process adding textures for custom model ?
can i texture paint the model in blender using stencil or something then export it as png file to use with SpiderTex
will it work ? ive been trying for hours don't know how to do it

- limited weights per vertex to 12

It was a mistake that this game supports 15 or 16 weights, its only 12 max.

I try to replace Classic suit. I can't get spiderman_pc_mi.exe working. I tried drag and drop 2 files (mymodname.ascii and characters_hero_hero_spiderman_classic_hero_spiderman_classic.model) also I tried with mymodname.ascii only and both options doesn't work. I can only change to ascii but not back to .model. Some tutorial would be nice.
I could import model in-game with ModelAsciiGUIWrapper.exe + this tool but there is big problem in-game - because imported suit will display in lowest resolution textures (512 i think?) in-game. It may change to high res only during certain cutscenes/locations but after loading save it will switch back to low res again : ( How to fix this issue? I can't upload my mod or even play it properly before it is somehow fixed.

I figured most of it out, this is what you do:


Find the model you want to modify and extract that model

- create a folder named "raw" and place the extracted .model there(only for your convenience)

- create another folder named "modified" (only for your convenience) or something and copy the .model, spiderman_pc_model.exe, and spiderman_pc_mi.exe there

- drag and drop the .model over "spiderman_pc_model.exe" and it will spit out a .ascii file

- use XPS tools to import the .ascii into blender or whatever 3d package you use

- if using blender export the model as a "V3 .ascii" overwrite the original file

- using cmd type [cd "path to folder with spiderman_pc_mi"] without brackets

- once the directory is changed, type [spiderman_pc_mi.exe "path to .model" "path to new .acsii"] without brackets and press enter
this will "inject" your modified .ascii into the .model in the "modified" directory
 note: my best results were found when I used the .model which is the same "modified" directory as the modified .ascii NOT the one in the original "raw" folder

- with the SMPC tool, right click the model you want to replace and choose "replace" and choose the .model we modified

- click "Test Mod" at the top to test it out

Version 0.51 beta

- limited weights per vertex to 12

It was a mistake that this game supports 15 or 16 weights, its only 12 max.

Hello! This is a really great tool, one problem I'm having is that the deformations on the mesh seem to be different with the re-injected mesh. Am I doing something wrong? i'm using the latest release of your programs.

I'm getting a " System.IndexOutOfRangeException" while trying to convert the .ascii to .model. To give you some context, I'm adding 3d raised webbing to the future foundation suit. I was able to add it to the torso and head, and import the models into the game without issues. But as soon as I add the weebing to the legs, or the hands, or the feet, I get that error. Any Ideas?

Are the webs on the hands/feet in the same group as the other webs? If not, I would try and attach them to the same group and see if the problem persists.

Actually I'm joining each webbing section to the corresponding body part mesh.
Update 1:
I've been doing a few more tests and trying stuff out, and now the error I'm getting is "Fatal error. Weight buffer overfloat".
I really don't know what to do with that, any Ideas?
Update 2:
I think the issue might be related to the poly count somehow, I tried adding the boots webbing first and I was able to create the .model file, then added the torso webbing and got the "System.IndexOutOfRangeException" error again.

Where are you getting the webbing from? I just added some random BS to a model with the wrong skeleton from the PS4 version of the game and it still successfully injected the model. Provided, the model was 100% messed up ingame, but it injected it.

As far as I understand, you can't share files from the game on here directly, otherwise id ask you to share them with me so I could give it a shot.

You need to create an exception in the windows defender settings, it always flags these tools that way for me.

I got a 3d model of the TASM 2 suit ripped the webbing and made quite a bit of changes to make it fit on the game's model.
I was able to inject into the game at some point, when the webbing was only on the torso and the head, i was able to inject and it worked fine, then I added the webbing to the lowe parts of the legs and then it started showing the error when converting the .ascii to .model

UPDATE: 
I solved the issue. As I suspected, the issue was related to the poly count, I used the decimate modifier on all webbing meshes, and now it works fine!

I'm not sure about some textures. Maybe someone could fix it.  

Is there any tools to export .Animclip to .fbx or something like that?

Hello! This is a really great tool, one problem I'm having is that the deformations on the mesh seem to be different with the re-injected mesh. Am I doing something wrong? i'm using the latest release of your programs.

i still had no time to check it, but i'm almost sure its because of blendshapes. On import, the tool switches them off.

Version 0.4 beta

Changes:
- support for static meshes (map assets etc.)
- support for almost any skeletal mesh if they have no more than 256 bones in their skeleton

I think there is an issue with beta 5 regarding the normal map display.
I think some data is either missing or not calculated in the same way the game expects it.

When importing my models into the game I figured the normalmaps looked inverted. 
So I tested flipping and switching the normal map channels - though when fixing it on one end of the model it broke on another end. 
So my guess is the model itself is causing this by either an incorrect tangents basis, missing binormals, some kind of modifications to the actual vertex normals or anything along the line.

Then I wanted to check back here and see if there's some information around and when I saw this image (again) it immediately struck me as it is nicely showing the issue:
The normals on the left side of the model (from the viewer right side) are inverted (up-down flipped) and one can see where both directions kind of meet on the vertical mirror axis of the object. 
Though I don't think it is as simple as "left side" it is just very apparent there but the issue is everywhere in some form.
It seems the UV-islands locations / rotations have an effect .. 
that's why I'm suspecting the tangent basis though it could also be something unique to this engine.

Anyways, thx for the great tool. Really appreciated!

So far i can't find anyone who knows how to calculate tangents for mirrored meshes with overlapped UVs.
There are lots of explanations on the net, but none of them work.

The best hint I can give is probably that [http://www.mikktspace.com](http://www.mikktspace.com) turned into some kind of standard in the industry. If Insomniac is using it is something entirely different though..

Version 0.55 beta of Model import tool:
- tangents/bitangent sign support
- fixed error message for weight buffer overfloat

Model exporter was also updated, to get proper NORMALS.
They were incorrect all this time. Not too far, but about 10% here or there.

As a first time modding tool for weighted actors i think once this gets solved: [viewtopic.php?p=187091#p187091](https://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?p=187091#p187091)
this will be the most complete mod tool for such options as otherwise the characters look distorted with out proper blendshapes during movement/action. Really impressive as always.

I think there are a few people around modding spider-man who do corrective blendshapes in their daily work or as students or similar. 
With blender they are actually quite easy to setup.
I haven't looked into blendshapes for spider-man but I could imagine exporting them es individual ascii files, importing them as shape keys into blender and vis-à-vis.
Or with a completely new char just setting them up, exporting as multiple ascii files and the tool builds the main mesh + blendshapes out of them.
Something along the line..

I think blendshape support would be really nice. I make them for custom rigs in 3DS max and it's not too bad. I understand though if you have no time to get to it!

Version 0.56 beta of Model import tool:
- lookgroup support
- _materials.txt is now expected as 3rd parameter, and not found automatically by the tool

Model export tool now outputs lookgroup data in _materials.txt
In the beginning of a file you will see a list, for example for classic suit:

```
0 6
6 5
```


It means model has 3 groups. Full model, body only, and head only. First includes 11 submeshes starting from 0. Second includes 6 submeshes starting from 0. And last one is 5 submeshes starting from 6.

You can edit it according to your custom model, and import tool will inject this data into .model file.

Hey I've been having issues with the SMP to blender model converter. I saw you said that you just drag the model file over your software's exe and it will convert, but when I go to import the XNALara/XPS model, nothing shows up in my files. I'm a complete beginner with this and I just really want to import smp models to blender

When you drag and drop .model on spiderman_pc_model.exe
Tool convert only to .ascii format
If you need using in XNALara/XPS studio, need make port, add texture, rename bones and etc.
Try search on Devianart, ported models

I've actually been having issues with the software even loading. It's meant to load up a menu when you drag and drop isn't it?

I've actually been having issues with the software even loading. It's meant to load up a menu when you drag and drop isn't it?

If you're talking about the .exe files I posted how to use them earlier in this thread. pm me if you have issues still

Usually there's not much difference between PS4 and PC assets, sometimes no changes in format, some devs might make some changes minor or major, you never know, but, you could try this: [viewtopic.php?f=16&t=23101](https://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=23101) and let us know if it works since you have the game
