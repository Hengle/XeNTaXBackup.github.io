Mhh i was wondering for a converter program for .3dc files... i have some shaiya's model but i have some problems with "flat" (it doesn't work on my pc and i need it as i red on [This topic](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=21&t=3739) ). Shaiya's models are in .3dc file, i have only 3d Object converter but when i try to convert it , Deep exploration can't see the converted files (also if they're in .3ds O.o) so i can't convert them in .x file O.O (i just want convert them in low/obj or 3ds files so i can reconvert them in x file with DE >.<). Someone knows other programs? In the while i'll search by myself =) 
In every case, thnx for the answers XD

Hi, I would like to recommend a [3D model search engine](https://www.yobi3d.com): Yobi3D.  You can search with simple keywords and see the results in 3D. It's useful to find some already made 3D models for prototyping.

Please check it out and any feedback is welcomed.

Thanks!

Dear ! look for games with purpose of "hunting simulator" like Cabela deer hunt series ... or low quality cartoon based 3d animal story games like zootycoon ... 
just first select which games have your desired graphics ?
then start a topic on it in Xentax then there are many professional to let you extract all models ... ?

No [Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com) site or [Yeggi](https://www.yeggi.com) engine for searching 3d models?    Well, they should be among the first to be mentioned.
Becides, more useful 3d models can be found here:

Recently came across a large collection of cars on the [Hum3D](https://hum3d.com/) website, they even have very rare models. It turns out they have been operating for many years, although I haven't seen them before.
