- Post Title: Neighbours From Hell TGA

Hello, I'm trying to make some adjustments to game textures and I have 1 issue:
I don't know how to convert game TGA to Photoshop readable format and back to game format.

I found that:
Animations have this format:
16 bit, 4A4R4G4B
The backgrounds have this format:
16 bit, 5B, 6G, 5R
-- [Original post](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=18&t=3730)

Is there any converters for it?

If you haven't noticed this, the samples on the old thread are not available anymore. We'd need something to try to work with tho.

And I made some improvements in your script, now it detects the mode ("b4 g4 r4 a4" or "b5 g6 r5").
