- Post Title: Farming Simulator 17 - l10n.xml as Mods ?

Hello! I extract all files from dataS.gar with [https://pastebin.com/raw/m7S33C8L](https://pastebin.com/raw/m7S33C8L) quickbms script. 
I've edited l10n_ru.xml in my language, but return of file back to dataS.gar did not work,because quickbms script does no have reimport.
Is it possible to use content of dataS.gar or only l10n_ru.xml as Mods ?

I found one user from an forum who claimed:

> I also wanna confirm that although reimporting doesn't seem to work, but putting back the extracted directory in the game dir works fine (move the original *.gar elsewhere). So, there's no need to reimport after you modified the files.

Is it possible ?
I wrote him, but this user does not answer me.

Sorry for my Bad English i use Google Translate.

It is possible, this method works for some other games. Just try it.

Bascally, this guy told you everyting that you need. Just extract files, put them in game directory and remove gar file. You can do such things in windows explorer or total commander.

If your archive file was "dataS.gar", then it seeems to be alright. Maybe this method just doesn't work on your version of the game.
