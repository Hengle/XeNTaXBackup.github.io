- Post Title: [PC] Starscape (.000)

Hi there again. The mr_robot_moon.bms script that was meant to decode files from Mr. Robot by MoonPod, doesn't work with Starscape by MoonPod. Does Starscape also have .jp2 images encoded in a single .000 file, just like Mr. Robot? 

Can someone edit the mr_robot_moon.bms script in the way that it can decode files from both Starscape and Mr. Robot? 
After that, you can rename the script to mr_robot_and_starscape.bms or moonpod.bms, I think.
