Your Program Is Give Me This Error_

the reimport option acts as a reimporter and so you cannot reinsert a
file if it's bigger than the original otherwise it will overwrite the
rest of the archive or cannot be loaded correctly:

new size: 6219 (6219 uncompressed)
old size: 6125 (6125 uncompressed)

do you want to skip this file? (y/N/force)
y will continue with the next file
N (default) will terminate QuickBMS
force will force the reimporting of the file

How Can I Fix This Error ?
