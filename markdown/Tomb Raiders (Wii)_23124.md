Hey, dudes. I want to make a translation for the Wii versions of games. Can someone help me with tools for unpacking files and translating text?

Each game has in most cases different set of tools, 
so you need to do a little searching.

Check our tools section [viewforum.php?f=31](https://forum.xentax.com/viewforum.php?f=31)
or tools blog [blog/](https://forum.xentax.com/blog/)

Also try to google it [https://www.google.com/search?client=fi ... r+wii+tool](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-d&q=tomb+raider+wii+tool)


You may also very often encounter situation where tools for some game just don't exist.
