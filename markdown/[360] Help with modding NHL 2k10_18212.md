- Post Title: [360] Help with modding NHL 2k10

Hello, I see there have been some attempts at modding the wii version of NHL 2k11, with success. I am here trying to mod 2k10 for the Xbox 360.

I have extracted the ISO file and I get 6 files from it. 
0A, 0B, 1A, 1B
These are about 1.7GB each, with no file extension. I was able to get 0A extracted using a quickBMS script that I found online, but the files are all .dat files that it seems I can do nothing to my knowledge with. I am not that great at reading hex, so I'm hoping somebody could help me with this  

default.xex

$SystemUpdate folder with 2 files

and a file that contains 4 images that are basically the boot art.

What I want to do with this is edit the in game textures. I would love to edit the audio files as well, but my main goal is the textures. Jerseys, Ice, Logo's, Goalie masks, Ext.

Thanks in advance to anybody that can try to help

Here are a couple of files. There are just about 2,400 of them, ranging in size from 0KB to 64,262KB. Any help would be greatly appreciated!!!

I would also love if this game became moddable. I guess getting anyone to jump on the challenge will be a challenge though...
