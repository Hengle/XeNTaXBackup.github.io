- Post Title: Mechwarrior 5 .pak extract

I'm trying to extract the contents of the mechwarrior 5 pak file, and apparently it should be possible to extract it with bms using th unreal_tournament_4.bms script.

However, when I try to run it, I get this:

 "Alert: Invalid command "2U`" or arguments (4), line 2
The script may use other supported languages and C structs, continue? (y/N)"

Trying to run anyway gives this:

- c_structs (4): "2U`" "6" "6" "I" "Zg|A#^g@Bs"

Error: invalid command "2U`" or arguments (-1), line 2
  coverage file 0     0%   0          10336      . offset 00000000

Can someone help me with this please?
