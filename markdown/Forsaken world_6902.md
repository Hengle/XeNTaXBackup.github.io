The items don't seem too hard to figure out.
The problem I'm having is the filenames: it's all in chinese!

How am I suppose to parse the names and then write it out exactly as it should be?
I'm using python btw.

Hmm it doesn't seem to use any special methods to deal with the file names.
I wonder if encoding will be an issue if I try to export it.

Using google to translate and find the model you want. Copy the folder to other directory and rename to English.
In the model folder, the .ski file and .dds are important. You can delete other file if you want.

That works.

Though, in this day and age, I want to be able to handle unicode as well. That would make it cooler.

Manually translating stuff just to get it to work would probably become less effective in the future as time continues to pass (although most MMO's still use ascii for all filenames and stuff, clearly there's some companies that deviate from it and start throwing in unicode just because they can o.O)
