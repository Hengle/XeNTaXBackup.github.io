- Post Title: PS2 King's Field: TAC TM2's

I've got some TM2's which aren't TM2's, but labeled as such in the files. This is pretty typical for FromSoftware, and usually they're easy enough to figure out but these images have some weird compression or something on them. I'm working to get a full suite of tools to work with the data of this game, and this format has been stopping me from completing that for a good year now.

I've attached some sample files, and a C# class which badly extracts a PNG from the file. Any information to point me where I should be headed is going to be much appreciated.
