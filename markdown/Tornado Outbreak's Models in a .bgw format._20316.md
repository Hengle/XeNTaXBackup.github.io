Is there any way to extract the content of Tornado Outbreak's .bgw files? [http://www.mediafire.com/file/2ufhw1jn9 ... k.bgw/file](http://www.mediafire.com/file/2ufhw1jn9xef739/trailerpark.bgw/file)

here, I was bored, it extracts some tga's, but not all of them are useful, so this needs more guessing than mine, have a nice day

oh sorry, I forgot, you have to decompress the file first, I did this for your example file, [see here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1lE4EsCzDMGdqdh2YsG2YLmgGVZmjJZlj), simply skip the first 8 bytes and decompress the rest as a single zlib blob

Is it possible to extract the .bmp files in the file itself?
