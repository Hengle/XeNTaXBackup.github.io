- Post Title: TrackMania Turbo (ManiaPlanet4) PAK

Could someone help me unpack this file?
I need to rip the car sounds of the recently-released TrackMania Turbo, but instead of making those files in a ZIP, they made it in their proprietary Pak format.


Here's the smallest file i could find: [https://mega.nz/#!5VknCb5D!QYWvXXd3DxF7 ... D0gffbqZPA](https://mega.nz/#!5VknCb5D!QYWvXXd3DxF7m4UhbMd0PiVchuDr_9g4ID0gffbqZPA)

I don't think the others are different, thanks a lot!

it's not hard to search too!

from the header this is a NadeoPak r18

pretty sure 1.57 would suppor this: [https://forum.maniaplanet.com/viewtopic ... 61&start=0](https://forum.maniaplanet.com/viewtopic.php?f=8&t=15761&start=0)

edit hmm tool tool reads the headers but shows no data?

Yeah, there are no extractors for ManiaPlanet due to the paks beign protected by a key (apparently its blowfish).
