Serious Editor 3.5 have option to export models and animations into fbx format (Problem there is that it doesn't export bone weights properly).
So far there is source code for Serious Sam over here: [https://github.com/Croteam-official/Serious-Engine](https://github.com/Croteam-official/Serious-Engine). I believe there is source file for .mdl serialization aswell.

Yea I made some few years later, now I focus more on reverse engineeing, it's much more fun.  

In SS3.5 when you load any model and are in model viewer there is in right column, up there a few buttons, there is export as fbx, and as obj I believe.
