the ARC script for quickbms seems valid for reinjection so take a look at section 3 of quickbms.txt:

then, just for your information, the author of the script is me and not that "sillysomething" who claimed the credits for the work done by other people (I refer to the final "print" he added to my script):

Oh sorry   , Btw wont the reinjection need the exact file size or something like this ? otherwise ill try it and see  
Edit : Yeah needs to be the same size ,this is possible using using Offzip too , but at least it extracts them to their right Directories , still we cant do anything like these mods on PC without a real repacker    .....
we really need a proper working tool   [http://z6.invisionfree.com/Resident_Evi ... 375&st=140](http://z6.invisionfree.com/Resident_Evil_4_PC/index.php?showtopic=15375&st=140)

The Biohazard 5/Resident Evil5 5 Extractor works partially on Code Veronica X HD collection (PS3). The Arc format must've been slightly adjusted, there is an issue with the name of the files? Don't know about a fix but I did extract and convert some textures.

Model format is not the same as Resident evil 5.

Yeah but it could be easily fixed to work properly , More important is that people still whining for a PS3 ARC TOOL FOR MODDING   ! . and still no response from anyone about it , will there was Mark but he is mostly busy , dont wanna put pressure on him
