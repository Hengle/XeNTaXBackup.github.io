I decided to collect my works into a single tool. There will be a base program that you need to download once, I will release small dll plugins for each new game. This should decrease the file size and also make it easier to manage.

How To Use

Launcher

Run the UniLauncher.exe first. It will show you all the game plugins inside the "Plugins" folder. Select the plugin you want to use and click the "Launch" button.



Program



Load

Model File : Path of the model file. Use "..." for file browser.
Skeleton File : Only required if the game uses separate skeleton files for models. Use "..." for file browser.
Load : Loads the model and shows it in preview window.
Notes

Game specific information.
Export

NEX : Exports the model in custom binary format (.nex), intended to be loaded by Noesis. Noesis script for this format : Nex Script
IQE : Exports the model in IQE format. Read here to see how to load IQE : http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?p=138153#p138153
Note  : Models will be exported into the folder Export.
Note 2  : Exporting might take some time depending on the game/model. Be patient with it.

Result




Game Plugins

Plugins are .dll files that need to placed inside the Plugins folder.

Very good tool. You are a genius.
However, in the process of extracting, I found that some of them could be displayed normally, while others could not. Can you see why?
I think it may be the problem of QuickBMS extracting script, some of which are normal and some are wrong.

That was my bad. I didn't do many tests with map files. They are working fine now. Also I have noticed that the meshes are loaded mirrored. That is what happens when you don't play the game and don't know what characters should look like 

Use the new plugin : [DoT New Plugin](http://www.mediafire.com/file/84x1yj7x8dwnoy3/Dawn_Of_Titans_U1.rar/file) . There is still a problem with "Clavicle" bones. Nothing too serious, but maybe I can try to fix them later.

Your Nex script can not be installed and used, nor does it support Blender2.8.

@xtiger Please don't double post that much . I appreciate you reporting the problems but better pm them to me instead of multiple comments.

I hhaven't released the tool for extracting the textures yet, I will do it some time.

Change the output size in script. In dot_bof.bms change value 10000000 to something larger, like 15000000.

Would there happen to be any chance of sharing the source code for the plugins? Would like to take a look at the Danganronpa Another Episode one and see how it works and compare it to a maxscript I was given a while back which can read the normals as well for the few models it worked with.

I won't be sharing the source code of the plugins.

You can take a look at the discussion of the .bnc format : [viewtopic.php?f=16&t=16463](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=16463) The plugin is more or less the product of this research.

I have never heard about the .nex format before.
Is it your own format?

(Or which program uses it officially?)

Ah I see, alright then. Any plans to add support to read the normals from .bnc files in that case then?

Normals are not inside the vertex blocks, they are stored separately for some reason. That is why I didn't bother getting the normals.

I can update the plugin to load the normals too. I will do it when I have the time.

For which game? I am guessing you mean Summon Night/Digimon. Those games use standard GXT format if I remember correctly. You should be able to load them with Noesis.

Do environments also load without issue?

I haven't even tried loading them tbh  Anything without skeleton should fail though.

I can add support for maps, it would just require a few changes. I will let you know when I update the plugin.

Updated FFT0 plugin to support maps, but had to update the base program again to add OBJ export. So download the base and the plugin again. I recommend exporting all maps as OBJ.

NEW GAME : Ty the Tasmanian Tiger 2/3 (PC)

I remember having fun playing this series when I was younger. The model format was also fun, but kinda troublesome  Probably because it was designed for PS2.

I tested this mostly with Ty 3 models, but Ty 2 seems to have the same format. Skinned models was the main focus. Still environment models should load fine too. They might not appear in preview, because of their scale.

MDG and MDL files are necessary, ANM is optional (for skeleton).

You can't. This is just something to collect my smaller personal works into a single program. It isn't a full-fledged model viewer with plugin support. That would be Noesis

Hi there, love the program here!

I was wondering if you wanted to add support for other games made by Krome Studios.

Details in a private message that I've sent to you.

The updates with the Type-0 Map support seem to work perfectly.
Thankyou so much for this, its really appreciated.
I was wondering if you have plans to support any other games in future via the same tool.
They're both PS1 games, Breath of Fire III and IV, nobody has been interested in the games enough to hack them open.
Coincidentally a number of Capcom games on Ps1 and Ps2 use the same file formats, so it could be an instance of supporting 1 game intentionally, and supporting 10 others unintentionally (provided they didn't change it, but from looking at the files they look similar)

I have plans to release other plugins for this tool, but I rarely do maps. Only when they aren't much different than character model loading. Like FFT0 for example.

PS1 is a bit too old for my taste. Also I have other games that I am working on atm. So unfortunately I won't have the time to look at the games you mentioned.

How can i create my own plugin?

You can't. This is just something to collect my smaller personal works into a single program. It isn't a full-fledged model viewer with plugin support. That would be Noesis

hello, i found 1 tool you wrote in 2016. Link: [https://www.reddit.com/r/blackdesertonl ... _explorer/](https://www.reddit.com/r/blackdesertonline/comments/434pl2/tool_black_desert_explorer/)
But I have an error, please help me

Yes, the reason being it was made in 2016 

Try out some of the more up to date scripts on xentax. Online game formats go through small changes over time, so anything old would probably not work.

I know the blender script, but there are many files that can't be opened, can you update? for both .srt files in speedtree how to open. I tried with ue4 but couldn't open it

NEW GAME : Valkyrie Anatomia (Android)

Finally had the time to release this plugin. Tested with bunch of skinned models, and it seems to work fine.

Unfortunately I haven't figured out how to get the textures working. So only models atm.

I don't remember the files of that game exactly. Mvgl seems like an archive. Maybe try this to extract it : [viewtopic.php?f=10&t=12666](https://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=12666)

It is a quickbms script. Search for quickbms on xentax, zenhax or google. There are probably lots of tutorials on how to use it.

Please help me.

It works fine for me. That nex file you uploaded isn't a nex model. It is a bof file. I don't know how it got that extension. Anyway rename its extension to bof. Then you can load it with UniViewer and export it as nex. Finally use the nex script for loading it in Noesis.

thanks for reply! so you tell me that UniViewer will only open bof? why there's bof unpacker then? do I have to use it?
whatever I do it gives me Error loading model

edit: I'm sure is it me. because I've tried several game version and can't load models from any of it. can you explain how to do it?

edit2: the issue was because I had both DLL and ZIP files of same plugin in Plugin directory. when I kept only DLL the models have started to working

edit3: textures doesn't convert properly with latest build of android (v1.39.1). I've checked DOT versions (android). somewhere between 1.3.4 and 1.3.0 devs did something with texture compression. so texture from version 1.3.2 should be convertible. I don't know the exact version but only a date for the build: 2019 july 18. keep in mind it was a year ago, many models could be added since then.

Hi, I was wondering if you also considered creating a plugin for the models from Ty 1?
