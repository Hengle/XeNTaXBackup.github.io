- Post Title: Deus Ex: Human Revolution .DRM files

I used Rick's Crystal Dynamics tools ([https://github.com/gibbed/Gibbed.CrystalDynamics](https://github.com/gibbed/Gibbed.CrystalDynamics)) to extract the DRM files from DXHR. It comes with an DRM Unpacker, but the output I get are all BIN files.

Here's some samples of the DRM files:
https://www.mediafire.com/file/2zbc0vbt ... a.drm/file
https://www.mediafire.com/file/szzfq4lp ... t.drm/file

And here's an example of the extracted BIN files: [https://www.mediafire.com/folder/64li4v ... e_a_unpack](https://www.mediafire.com/folder/64li4v46gebkn/drone_a_unpack) (I get the same set of BIN files regardless if I ran DRMDecompress or not)

I tried using this unpacker as well ([viewtopic.php?f=16&t=10765&p=160624](https://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=10765&p=160624)) which claims to be able to unpack the DRM files, but I'm getting nothing. While the second unpacker works to get the models + textures + bones, it's not quite organized (some textures would be in other folders) and the UV maps are broken (for both SMC and OBJ)

I tried files from both DXHR and DXHRDC but vanilla HR seems to work better with all the tools. I also tried TR9 tools, still nothing.

Help?
