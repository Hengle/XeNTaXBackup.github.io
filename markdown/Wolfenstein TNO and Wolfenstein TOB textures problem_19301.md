- Post Title: Wolfenstein TNO and Wolfenstein TOB textures problem

Hi everyone!

I think, I should tell about the things, that brought me here. I'm a big Wolfenstein fan and very like the universe, created by MachineGames. Especially I like the graphic design in Wolfenstein, such as in-game concepts and posters, so I'm trying to extract them from the game to enjoy their beaty in original resolution. 

The problem is - I'm not a computer guy at all.

Fortunately, I was able to find Wraith Colossus by DTZxPorter and id-daemon, so, I extracted the needed textures from the third game, Wolfenstein The New Colossus. 

Still, I couldn't find the same programs or solutions for extraction of files from Wolfenstein TNO and Wolfenstein TOB. For nearly half a year I was trying to find the needed files in Internet. Sadly, I found only a part of needed posters and concepts from Wolfenstein TNO and almost nothing from Wolfenstein TOB. So, desperately, I tried to look on forums, such as Zenhax and Xentax, for any solution for extracting the files. And finally, I found the programm, Unpakke it is called, and it is suitable both for extracting files from TNO and TOB.

I used it, and I think, succesfully - it extracted dozens of files, which I think, are textures but there is a problem - they have BIMAGE format and concepts have DCT format. I tried to use various methods and scripts for various programs, written on forums, but have no luck at all.

So, I ask for help in converting these files into some readable formats, like png. Or, if I shouldn't use unpakke from the start and should have used some other program or method - please, tell to me, what I need to do in order to get these textures. Because I really don't know - what to do.

P.S. Attached samples of files to post.
P.P.S. Sorry for any grammatical mistakes in post - I'm not a native speaker and only learning the language.

Hoping for help,
Koralan

I tried to use [Acewell's plugin for Noesis](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=18&t=12853&hilit=wolfenstein+bimage), but it cannot open both the Old Blood and New Order. (I inserted plugin into the noesis436\plugins\python and tried to open bimage file by using noesis). For me, it seems like I'm doing something wrong, or Unpakke somehow damaged files, when extracting it. May someone help me?

concept_uboat_hq_hg.dct is just a jpg file. But the data seem to be corrupted. The rest two are nothing but null data.
