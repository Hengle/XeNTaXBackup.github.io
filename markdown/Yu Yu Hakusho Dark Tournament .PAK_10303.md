- Post Title: Yu Yu Hakusho Dark Tournament .PAK

Hi, I was browsing through the files in Yu Yu Hakusho Dark Tournament and I believe the Characters are stored in .PAK format. It seems the most logical. Anyways I was looking through one of the .PAK file with HxD and I found instances of .Char, .MDL and .XML. I was hoping someone could add support for this game.

Unfortunately, I can't post a file because if I understand the rules correctly I'm not allowed to post links. But hopefully this image will help in someway.

Thanks for trying but unfortunately it didn't work.

I don't know if this has any important information, but I'm just putting it out there.

```
- select the input archives/files to extract, type "" for whole folder and subfo
lders
- select the output folder where extracting the files
- open input file C:\q\Hiei.pak
- open script C:\q\yuyu.bms
- c_structs: "clog" "NAME" "OFFSET" "SIZE"

Error: invalid command "clog" or arguments -1 at line 27

```


I could upload a file to MediaFire or DropBox but don't the rules state no links to file sharing sites?

I could PM you the link, it's only 2.49 MB?

Thanks, it works like a charm.  

Now, I just need to figure out how to convert the models to something that can be imported into a model program. I've added a .XML and .MDL file if anyone wants to look at the files.
