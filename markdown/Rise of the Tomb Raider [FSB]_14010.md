Does anyone have any ideas how to extract clean sound?

I used a script to extract the FSB files from the bigfile_ENGLISH.000.tiger. And got more than 8 thousand files. To extract the audio from the FSB to use fsbext. But too much audio interference - [https://yadi.sk/d/5xUqMRctnwxb8](https://yadi.sk/d/5xUqMRctnwxb8)
The [FSB](https://yadi.sk/d/stgriWDmpH2eT) file meets constantly this text -- ННННННННFSB4, and I think, because he had problems with the sound. But even if so, I do not know how to get clean audio.

Use this to demux the MUL files. Then decode FSB4 files as usual.

Anyone got a fix for how the audio tools sometime fail to convert certain audio files? Really just looking for the soundtrack
