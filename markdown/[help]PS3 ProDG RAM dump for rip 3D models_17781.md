- Post Title: [help]PS3 ProDG RAM dump for rip 3D models

I'm trying to get 3D models from THE iDOLM@STER One For All with ProDG like this video ([https://youtu.be/yLhB_dv5WHw](https://youtu.be/yLhB_dv5WHw)).
So I googled and asked about it to uploader of that video.
And I got ProDG.

My PS3 is in REBUG 4.81 DEX now. And ProDG worked well.. except kernel explorer.
There were nothing in that menu. Also I made debug EBOOT.BIN for game with make_fself.

So I googled again, tried reset to debug mode, just gray debug station screen pops up. 
When I try to exit that screen with 'exit game', my PS3 goes to black screen and freeze.

I can't do nothing for now. But I can boot normally with System Software mode. Game sill works.

What did I wrong? And is there anyway to solve this?
