I have modified and released the 3D Object Converter v6.520 as a web update.

How to get the 3D Object Converter v6.520:
Please download the 3D Object Converter from [http://3doc.i3dconverter.com](http://3doc.i3dconverter.com) and install it
or download the portable version and extract it into a folder.

Run the program and use the Help/check for updates function to get it.

I will release the updated i3DConverter for Mac and Linux versions later.

Use the correct extract script to extract the Raiders of the Broken Planet archives:

Hopefully this is fixable. Thanks!

 all of them, or some. or all, some are imported on the first try some needs many try, but not specifically some.. Example: 
[https://www.deviantart.com/oo-fil-oo/ar ... -759193246](https://www.deviantart.com/oo-fil-oo/art/ROTBP-ALICIA-UMBRA-OUTFIT-759193246)  for this i tried 20 times before Max imported her..  I have Max 2011 64bit, plus some Hair opacity textures are not working. But that is not your fault. Btw thank you very much for your efforts

the characters importing works good. Tested all of them. 
Only Aneska didn't, but you said that.
The weapons are perfect.
The sceneries no one works.

Hello, completely new here,
So I am doing some tests and each time when I extract the models from this game using the max script
I end up with no textures but a lot of weird colors, I am on a totally vanilla Max 2017, I don't know if there is something specific to setup for it to take the textures from the dds folder



I also tested with the model converter, same issue, I don't have the textures applied on the model
In hope someone will help me

In hope someone will help meI don't know how to parse materials so this is NOT an error this is not implemented feature. you have to apply textures manually.

Thanks for your answer ! Since I plan to do a web viewer to look at the characters of this game, extracting them all and applying the textures manually for each would take a lot of time,
Isn't there scripts to automate that ?

Also I am wondering if anyone managed to extract/convert animations out of those .cm3 files ?

Sorry if I ask a lot of questions haha

And thank you for all you did

Thanks for the script Tosyk much appreciated, does this rely on a certain version of 3dsmax? I have Max 2015 and all the scene/level/object files I have tried failed.

The characters import well, apart from eliteofficer. (haven't tested them all yet).
