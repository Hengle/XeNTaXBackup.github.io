- Post Title: Super Cloudbuilt pkdwin/pkiwin files

Hi I'm trying to extract the files from [Super Cloudbuilt](https://store.steampowered.com/app/463700/Super_Cloudbuilt/). It uses the format pkdwin and pkiwin to store its data and I can't figure out how to extract it using QuickBMS. 
The only other games I have found using the format is [PixelJunk Shooter](https://zenhax.com/viewtopic.php?t=997) and [Frozen Synapse Prime](https://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=13&t=4450&p=101700&hilit=pkdwin#p101700), both scripts I've found do not completely work.

Here are the data files I've zipped up of the game, If anyone could provide help with the script I'd greatly appreciate it.
