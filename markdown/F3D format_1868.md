- Post Title: F3D format

Hello
This is a bike models out of motoracer 3 its in F3D format, I knew a guy that was converting them back to lwo but he never released the tool and his site has closed now 
So any help with converting these would be much appreciated.
Thanks

If most of it is in French I donâ€™t think there is much chance of doing anything with them anyway is there?
But Thanks a lot for looking at them for me I appreciate it 
Thanks

I scanned the file before uploading it and it was all clear

myself...I strongly agree with that statement.

Here is what I came up with, should be more than enough to start working on a tool.  The attached file is a hexworkshop structures file.  Open it and create an F3D structure at the beginning of the file.

You'll see i figured out most of the major stuff in there, however i couldn't manage to figure out materials.  I have a feeling it has to do with the arrays marked "Stuff1", "Stuff2", and the bones.

(Blah, admins should really open up file extension restrictions.  Having to zip a 2k text file is just wrong.)
