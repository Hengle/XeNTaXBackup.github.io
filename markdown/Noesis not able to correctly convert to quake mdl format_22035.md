- Post Title: Noesis not able to correctly convert to quake mdl format

Hi guys,
I hope you're all alright with bad stuff happening outside. I'm trying to convert this 3d model:

its fbx format with 30 frames to quake mdl format for my own video game. But the matter is the uv not being properly rendered, you can see it there:


I've used the uvw Xform 3ds max modifier to divide all the uv pairs by 2, otherwise the model wouldn't have been usable. I've also tried the few mdl parameter commands, but none of them worked. That's the first time Noesis converted me incorrectly to mdl, maybe some you have any idea?
If you need the model, the bitmap I'm using as the material, request me. Thanks in advance!
