The 3D Object Converter has a NEX Model .nex loader module and the Wavefront .obj export module.
Download the 3D Object Converter from [ http://3doc.i3dconverter.com](http://3doc.i3dconverter.com) and install it or download and use the portable version (if you don’t have it yet).

Finally after a long time, someone answered my question, thank you.
But can that tools convert it back from .OBJ to .NEX format? and .NEX to .TPL format?
