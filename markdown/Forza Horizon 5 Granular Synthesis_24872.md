I wanna ask, has someone managed to extract the granular synth files in fh5? I wanna know since there's so many that I would happily use for my nfs sound mods but unfortunately they're in a weird .zip format. thanks in advance

I am having the same issues as you and i hope someone can make the necessary edits to the script.bms for fmod .bank and also the fsb aud extr. exe that will extract files with correct namings engine, exhaust, intake and rpms for each..... please if someone can look into it will be fantastic for all the other different simulation games this can be used for to multiply the entertaining value of all these games.
