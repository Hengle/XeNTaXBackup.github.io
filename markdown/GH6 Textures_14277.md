- Post Title: GH6 Textures

I'm looking for help understanding what form of compression this image format uses. I'd like to say it's some form of DXT*, but that's just a guess. Any body care to help?

Only things I could find were 4 bytes at the start which are present on all the textures, even from previous games which used .DDS & a header tag, which is 'tfos'.

Thanks,
