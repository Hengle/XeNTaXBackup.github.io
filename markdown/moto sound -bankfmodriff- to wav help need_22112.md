- Post Title: moto sound -bank/fmod/riff- to wav help need

Hi!

moto sound file: [https://www.coin-op.de/temp/motosound.bank](https://www.coin-op.de/temp/motosound.bank)

It is an fmod file, with extension .bank.
I checked it in the hex online editor "hexed.it".

It starts with RIFF.... "hexed.it" says 40% match an FMOD sample bank (RIFF)

I have already tried the instructions from brendan [viewtopic.php?t=15904](https://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?t=15904), but it does not work. Perhaps because its an RIFF file. An fsb was created, but very small (from .bank 3MB to 100kb) and unfortunately the other tools from his tutorial are no longer online.

Can anyone help convert to .wav? 

Dan

Can anyone view the file? Which type / format it is, that would surely help me to get ot to a wav, ogg or mp3.

Many Thanks!!
