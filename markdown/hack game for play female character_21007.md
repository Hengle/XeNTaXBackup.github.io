- Post Title: hack game for play female character

Guys, can anyone help with the game? I really want to play for a female character in the game "25 to life" in multiplayer. Earlier, when the official server was alive, I saw that some hackers managed to play for a female character. But I do not catch how they succeeded. This character is loaded only in a single player game through a script. In the character editor, it is not loaded. I donâ€™t understand how to make a female model in the editor load.




in this video, the hacker plays for the female character Mendoza
