- Post Title: Silkroad Online [BMS static mesh file]

Hi, first of all, I'm very new to this community, hopefully you guys will accept me with warm huggies 

For months, I've done extreme research on google for existing Silkroad's BMS to OBJ/OBJ to BMS converter.
But, every turns is just a dead end.

Here are the list of related topic discussed about the BMS file, as you can see most of it are dead projects, and only manage to convert from BMS to OBJ, not the otherwise.

But, yesterday, I found a topic on this forum, discussing about the BMS file

>>[Here](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?p=29712#p29712)<<

So, I've decided it's gonna takes forever for an OBJ to BMS converter, so I think it's fairly better if I make an effort of trying to code a BMS converter.

Here's the snitch, I only have a fair amount of knowledge of coding, binary files format or such.

So, if anyone is kind enough, I'm very interested to learn format converting, and very dedicated to learn.
