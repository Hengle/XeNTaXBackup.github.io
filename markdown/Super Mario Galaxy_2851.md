- Post Title: Super Mario Galaxy

There has been so much praise already written and said about Super Mario Galaxy for the Wii, but I'd just like to point out that most of it is absolutely true. 
It's a truly addictive, fresh and excellent 3D-platformer with a lot of new ideas and variety. 

Holy Cow!
