- Post Title: How To: Killer Instinct PC Sounds.

Just wanted to make a quick post on a way to get the sounds out of KI on the PC and make them playable.

I'm sure that this can be further scripted to make it easier and more organized, but this is a quick dirty way to do it to get people started.

Download this script pack. [http://www.filedropper.com/kisoundconvert_1](http://www.filedropper.com/kisoundconvert_1)

Grab your Global.pak from your install directory for the KI and extract that. In that extracted folder you will see the following directory: \audio\wwise\generatedsoundbanks\windows. That is where all of the character, global, and announcer sound files are located.

You will see all of the audio packs per character, announcer, etc in there with the extension .33. You will need to extract the individual sound file banks from those packs.

Just copy whichever .33 file (like Char_Cinder.33) you want to get the sounds from into the folder with the scripts in the pack I uploaded above, and run the bat file I put in there named "ExtractandConvert.bat".

It will first extract the wavs and then decrypt and convert them to usable wav files. Thats all.

Then you can listen to the wav files, or easily convert them to mp3 or whatever.

Easy Enough I guess.

in the process of extracting audio, the name for the audio files is lost....are some way to preserve it automatically?. when i'm open the converted wav file in cool edit pro, the program can't find any audio, but show the original name for the file inside the .33 file. Now i'm rename the files by hand but the process is tedious as hell (are  up 100 files in every .33 file). I'm attach an screenshot to explain better
