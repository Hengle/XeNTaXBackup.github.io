- Post Title: ttarch model swap

Hello,

I've been trying to model swap Elaena by Gwyn in TellTale GoT Game (Episode 5) in this scene: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJg2jlS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJg2jlS) ... &t=1h7m50s

I renamed all Gwyn's model files for Elaena's (including Elaena's "naked" model) but when I'm playing that scene isntead of Gwyn there's only air:



Some knows what I did wrong?

Ty!
