you could get models from just about all of them now.

except the tools for DC were lost, after tecmo went awall, I was never able to find them.

but you could use 3dripper in combination with nullDC+dx9 support. doa4, theres actually a few tools laying around here. and doa3, you would use the old doa3 exporter, or a viewer like greedxplorer

Thanks, been looking for that tool for ages.  Now if only I could actually view models... I have the discs (DOAU1/2, DOA3, DOAX), but GreedXplorer can't read the data off my discs, I can only see the fake layer with the VIDEO_TS folder.

I'm still trying to figure out how to view the models in the first place. :/ Do I need to rip my discs or can Greed view straght from the disc?
