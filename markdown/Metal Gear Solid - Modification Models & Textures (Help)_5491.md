- Post Title: Metal Gear Solid - Modification Models & Textures (Help)

Hi there, i'm actually on the modification of Metal Gear Solid PC, and i have succesfully extracted all the MGZ's files (efx.mgz, stage.mgz, stagevr.mgz, and tga.mgz) from C:\Program Files\Metal Gear Solid with Dragon Unpacker and now, i have 4 folders named efx, stage, stagevr, and tga.
In the stage folder, there are sub-folders (levels of MGS), with DAR's files. 
For exemple, the Tank Hangar is the s02a sub-folder and i have also succesfully extracted all DAR's files named stg_tex1.dar (Textures), stg_tex2.dar (Textures), stg_tex3.dar (Textures) and stg_mdl1.dar (Models) with Unmass and in the textures DAR's files, there are PCX files, i have modified some PCX's files, but the problem is, no possibility to repack all PCX's files in a DAR file.
So if anyone is working on Metal Gear Solid PC and know a possibility to repack PCX's files in a DAR file, thanks alot for your help because just this action is missing for complete the modification.

Hi Thunder, firstly, happy to know i am not alone on MGS modding   
I did exactly like you and i have the same problem, no way to repack PCX files in a DAR file for complete modifications.

I have used exactly same software as you :

Dragon Unpacker for extract MGZ files and Unmass for DAR files.

It's strange with Unmass, we can extract but no repack  

I want to gather the maximum of people who mod MGS for find a solution to repack DAR files.
I have found someone in the Mirex forum who has the same problem as us.

If someone can help us thanks in advance

the old MGS integral for PC right? I still have my discs somewhere. unfortunately, from what i've heard about MGS (zlib usage i think) it would be hard to remake new ones without modifing the game's executable. what i remember hearing is that the zlib compressed sizes are verified by the game, to prevent modifing. at least, thats what i heard. most console to pc ports get very little mod support, mgs integral is no exception.

Hello there,

I think we are not much to modding Metal Gear Solid.
Well same problem as you... no way to repack DAR files...

I think, someone make a software or script for repack DAR files but i tried Unmass created by Mirex and i have succesfully extracted DAR files.

If Mirex has created the script for extract, he can create a script for repack and the problem will be solved and we can repack DAR files.

I say Mirex but if anyone know how create Software or script, me i dont know how do...

But i have modified Biohazard/Resident Evil with BIOFAT and the style of script for repack files must be same.

At this time i think, the only software for Extract DAR files is Unmass and for this moment all we can do with MGS is:

Extract MGZ files (efx.mgz, stage.mgz, stagevr.mgz, tga.mgz) located in :

C:\Program Files\Metal Gear Solid\

And after, extract DAR files present for exemple in C:Program Files\Metal Gear Solid\stage\s00a
s00a is the Dock.

Files of C:Program Files\Metal Gear Solid\stage\s00a:
stg_tex1.dar (stage textures)
stg_tex2.dar (stage textures)
stg_tex3.dar (stage textures)
stg_mdl1.dar (stage models)
00a.hzm (Unknown)
00a.lit (unknown)
00a_r1.hzm (unknown)
00a_r2.hzm (unknown)
00a_r3.hzm (unknown)
null.hzm (unknown)
data (unknown)
demo.gcx (unknown)
null.kmd (unknown)
null.lit (unknown)
s00a.bin (unknown)
s0102a1.con (unknown)
scenerio.gcx (scenario of the level)

Some files of stages are unknown for me.

If there are news, tell me here

Hi all,

I have tried to launch the game after extract stg_tex1.dar from s02a (Tank Hangar) but the textures are missing in the game, i'ts black but other textures of stg_tex2.dar and stg_tex3.dar are present.

So, i think the game must read DAR files for show textures

Maybe possibility for the game show textures (PCX files) extracted and without DAR files?

Because i want replace the model and textures of Solid Snake by Liquid Snake for test.

I'm not interested in modding this game, but I would be if I knew how to repack a DAR. I'll be keeping an eye on this topic.
All I'm aware of is that Solidus is supposed to be able to replace images in a DAR file. Unfortunately, MGSPC DAR files are incorrectly recognised by Solidus due to some sort of data spacing issue...
Slightly off-topic, but have you posted what changes you are trying to make to MGSPC elsewhere Thunder?
I'm interested in what your plans are for this game.

Hi Friedslick6,

for Solidus, forget it for MGS, it work only succesfully with MGS2.
for this moment i work only with Dragon Unpacker for MGZ files and Unmass for DAR files.
Mirex will work on DAR file repacker and if he want on other stage files, Spinal gave it the complete stage s00a (Dock).

I have talk of MGS modifications only here and i keep an eye on the two topics created by Spinal in the Mirex forums:
[http://mirex.mypage.sk/RNR/rnr.php](http://mirex.mypage.sk/RNR/rnr.php)
[http://ffab.mypage.sk/viewtopic.php?t=135](http://ffab.mypage.sk/viewtopic.php?t=135)

Firstly, when there will be a possibility to repack DAR files, i will work on the Model and textures for make test.

Hm... Thunder, are you the same user as Thunder2 who made some gameshark codes for Metal Gear Solid by any chance?

Regarding text, radio.dat holds all codec dialouge, excluding what is displayed outside the codec screen.
All other dialogue is held within the .dmo files of the 'demo' folder.
Despite the name, this includes dialogue of scenes beyond Metal Gear Solid's demo release.
MGSI.ICD contains text from a Public Database file.
(The last line of this file reads the original directory: C:\mgs\source\MGS_Work___Win32_Integral\mgsi.pdb)
btw, I found no distinguishible text in brf.dat, brfvr.dat or face.dat.

It's been years but I can probably write up a DAR repacker. I'll look at it sometime this week. As for viewing KMD, I did some work on this, but again it's been years. Maybe I'll try doing this again since I'm a bit more experienced than I was then.

Like someone else said earlier, it seems to not act right if you re-zip 'stage.mgz'. The game will start and take you to menus but when you go to start a new game it says "Insert disc 1". I'll look into it, I'd done a fair bit of hacking around with it in IDA Pro years ago. I'll see if I can come up with a checksum patch or something. Whatever the case, as of right now, it doesnt seem possible to do this without some work. In the meantime(I can do plenty of coding at work but playing MGS would probably not go over well  I'll see if I can revisit the KMD format.

Give me news about that when you can
