- Post Title: [Extract possible?] Model from Unity Project with Anims?

Hey Guys,

I just try to build a Unity Demo Project an wanted to use Wind-Waker-Link Model (with animations) from a Unity Demo.
Link to the Demo: [http://zfgc.com/forum/index.php?topic=36964.0](http://zfgc.com/forum/index.php?topic=36964.0)

I was able to extract the Model (with bones) from this demo and used another Tool to get the anim-files.
Dunno if the anim-files corrupted but they won't work for me :/

I've uploaded the Model + the anim-files so probably someone can help me out with this?
I want to use these Animations for this model (Walk, idle and Jump).
Otherwise is it possible to extract the model + animations from the Gamecube or WiiU Game?
