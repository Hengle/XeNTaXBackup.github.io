- Post Title: Which multiplayer games you play

Do you play online? If so, which games are your favourite? 

I used to play Counterstrike and Unreal Tournament a whole lot, the first even in a clan for a brief period; two actually, DEO (Destructive Extremist Organization) and AO (Always Online), a fake all-women clan, that used the "Always" protective pad company logo....The chat-ups you get in CS when you're a woman.... 

I also played Battlefield, Return to Castle Wolfenstein a lot, and some C&C Generals. 

If you see someone named The Age Of Chaos, or The Age, that'll probably be me kicking your ass in some online game...
