Here is the Game Extractor (Basic Version) plugin for this game. Unzip it into your plugins/ directory. If you use the full version of Game Extractor, send me an email and I will give you a plugin for the full version.

Well the basic version of Game Extractor is version 0.94, and the full version is 1.02 . Somewhere between the different versions of the program, I made some adjustments that prevent the basic version using full version scripts, and vice versa.

The full and basic versions of the scripts do the same thing though, you will just need a script for the version of Game Extractor that you use.

Oh, and most of the basic scripts I write from now on won't have save support, because there were some bugs in the basic version that would not compile the archives properly. This is particularly important for compressed archives. However, the bugs were fixed in the full version.
