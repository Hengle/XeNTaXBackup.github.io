- Post Title: Saisei-Hen Audio rip tools

I'm looking for the tools that are necessary to read and rip the audio files for Super Robot Wars Z2.2 Saisei-Hen. I have managed to extract the .BIN files but I am absolutely stumped on how to decrypt and read the files.



Any help would be greatly appreciated.
