- Post Title: Graphics artists wanted for 8-bit pixeling

Hi! 

Are you a graphic artist, looking for something different to do? 

Every heard of the Commodore 64 scene? Check out [https://csdb.dk](https://csdb.dk) to see what kind of productions this part of the demo scene make. 

Fancy you can go 8-bit graphics in 16 colors (or with a little machine push some more actually) like the examples below? 
320x200 pixeling ? 4 colours out of 16 colour palette in an 8x8 pixel box? 

Then why not leave a message here, or send me a PM.  We're looking for our own gfx artists to beef up some scene productions. If you do well, great groups may want you among their ranks.  I hope some of you will see this as a nice new challenge. The scene is a great family. And has loads of parties to go to and present your work as well.
