- Post Title: RIDE 3 Modding 3D Models:

Hi People !!,,
So i try to mod the 3d model of the Kawasaki ZX-7RR it's ' chassis_323 ' but i'm a complete newbie when it comes to 3d models ... i attached a  very bad sketch where you can get an idea from what you have to do on the backside of the kawasaki, it's since my childhood i'm obsessed with that bike from a guy who lived the next village... 

If Anyone Could Help Me Please? it would change my life forever!!    (I like Ride 3 so much, and RIDE 4 is gonna be to hard i guess ...)

Kind Regards, and very very Much Thank You's
