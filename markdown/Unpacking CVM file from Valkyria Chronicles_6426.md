DATA.CVM fully decrypted, all tools for game's translation ready.
Also, russian version of game already on trackers (translated by our team).
For now, I preparing a special ToolBox for another teams which will provide them to translate Valkyria Chronicles to their own language.

Great work Ranger !

I wonder, if all files are decrypted, are there some which contain models skeletons ?

( Yeah, I know, I'm always blocked with it and in a fully year, I still haven't learned to create skeletons :p )

Ranger, how long do you think it will take to release the toolkit?
I'm not trying to be pushy or anything.
Just an average date, so I know when I (and or other people) can start making the translation for this amazing game 

And I have another question:
Will it be possible to insert another font?
Because each language has its own specific characters (I think that it will possible, if you translating this game into Russian)

Thank you for your time and answer(s).

I will release my "raw tools" next month if you want it. It's not a toolbox, but it is enough to translate the game.
And one more, you can start translation right now, all texts here: [http://turbobit.net/mhbxx338epel.html](http://turbobit.net/mhbxx338epel.html)

@RangerRus Thank you ranger plus for the effort of sending me the text for translation.

Unfortunately, it got deleted . Would it be possible to re-upload it?
Thank you

I also want to thank you for your time and efforts, that you give in order to make the translation happen  
I wish you good luck with this, and other projects you might probably have.
