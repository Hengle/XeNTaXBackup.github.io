- Post Title: Brink ccfmesh and ccfimage files

Hi everyone!

I was able to download Rick's tools for unpacking the Brink sdpk2 files and compile them into an exe that worked perfectly. The resulting files look like they could be easily deciphered and converted by someone with the necessary skill. I would be more than happy to provide sample files to any interested person. Here are some screenshots of the files when opened in a hex editor:
