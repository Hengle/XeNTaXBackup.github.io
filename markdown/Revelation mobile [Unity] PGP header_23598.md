- Post Title: Revelation mobile [Unity] PGP header

Hi guys   

Game name: Revelation mobile
Link: [https://www.tap.io/app/91974](https://www.tap.io/app/91974)
Sample: around 200 mb, I uploaded the whole archive, if you prefer me to cut them let me know. 
res_0 PGP header [https://www.mediafire.com/file/tea849qq ... _0.pg/file](https://www.mediafire.com/file/tea849qqn5aofn7/res_base_0.pg/file)
res_01 normal unity header [https://www.mediafire.com/file/ac262crt ... _1.pg/file](https://www.mediafire.com/file/ac262crtli9a3tj/res_base_1.pg/file)

After downloaded the game I extracted content from the apk(near 2gb) using APK Easy tool since  I can't install it because my device is not compatible.
In the archive I found resources organized in 17 .pg archive. 
The first one got this header:



The others from second to the last one got a normal unity header:




The problem is that when I try to open or extract the .pg unity header archives with assets studio I just got 1% of the content.

Get VGMToolbox. Download the attached rar, extract the .xml into plugin-Advanced Cutter of VGMtoolbox folder.
Open VGM -> Misc tool -> Extraction tools -> Generic -> Advanced file cutter -> Preset "PKG CH Game" -> Load, drop file, it'll extract all the UnityFS header files. 
Res_0 also have lots of unity files inside.

You can use this ^ method for some other games too.

OT Note: Strange for netease to use unity, they usually go with their home engine.

Thanks a lot it worked perfectly! It was a surprise for me too when I found out was using unity, but it's better so we could have skinnes mesh and animations working

Hi, can this really work perfectly?
I have created very many files after using this software to decrypt them.

After that I open it with asectstudio, the model can export obj properly but not fbx and bone skin, including animations.

And the textures are all wrong images

How did you solve it

The images are not wrong, they seem to be encrypted, for animation clip I found them. 
Anyway I tried with extracted .apk , I didn't install the game since my device was not compatible. Maybe if you install it would download more files...

So you also failed to export normal textures, and models with bones?

Now it can not be extracted from the file.
