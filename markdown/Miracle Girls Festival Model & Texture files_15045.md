- Post Title: Miracle Girls Festival Model & Texture files

Since it's possible to dump PS Vita Games, i've dumped my copy of Miracle Girls Festival i've ordered from Japan. I started off by using the PSARC Extractor to get the FARC files from the data.psarc. Then i started to extract the model files from one .FARC file to test them out using Noesis and the Project Diva F 2nd Plugin by chrrox (Shoutout to him). Every .FARC has a TXD, TXI, OSD and OSI file. The TXD files worked with Noesis, but the OSD files are giving me an error message (see attachment). Does anyone know how to open the model files? For example this Model here: [http://www.mediafire.com/download/b1yo2 ... PSVita.zip](http://www.mediafire.com/download/b1yo2naadkuf9b1/PSVita.zip)
If necessary i could link to a download of the Dump i've uploaded.

I can't upload for some reasons on Mediafire (due to some Upload errors). So i'll leave a link to a dump i've uploaded earlier. Just rename the .MP4 to .ZIP and you should find the .PSARC files in the rom folder. Extract both .PSARC files with a PSARC Extractor and you'll get the .FARC files.
