Is there any way I can export models from the new Serious Sam 4? I haven't seen much in the line of porting when it comes to the Serious Engine.

Probably no chance until Croteam adds support for SS4 to their Fusion Editor, if they're going to.

There is chance they could since they have all the other ones but I doubt it will be any time soon. It will probably be a few months for them to add support
