Who can help me edit fonts for the game Mars: War Logs. Or help them convert from PGZ in DDS (PNG) and back.

So far I only found a 256x256 texture at 0x1A71 - 0x41A70 (0x40000 bytes)
With a tga header it looks like this:

Change file extension from PGZ to PSSG and use for it Ryder PSSG Editor to export / import textures.
BTW fonts are made by BMF Bitmap Font Genereator from AngleCode.
