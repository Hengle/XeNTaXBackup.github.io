- Post Title: Detecting and extracting havok animation data

Hi there,

I'm wondering if anyone has come across a way to tell if animation data is compressed for the havok animation sdk?

I'm looking at animation data for Star Wars Force Unleashed and I can't make any sense of the keyframe data stored for each bone.

[viewtopic.php?f=10&t=3823&p=34905#p34905](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=3823&p=34905#p34905)

After some digging on the internet I think this game may use havok for animation and that the data may be in a compressed format.

I'm hoping anyone out there looking at animation data for other games may be able to provide an insight?

Fingers crossed

If you could upload the animation file I might be able to help.
