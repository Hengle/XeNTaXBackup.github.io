- Post Title: Kingdom Hearts model help

Hey everyone.

I've been attempting to extract the model of Monstro the Whale (not the map, the actual character) from KH1 but I'm having 0 luck. I've followed a few tutorials already involving Noesis and a khdump tool, and the model I'm looking for isn't even showing up in the list of files that were dumped. I attempted the same thing with BBSFM, and still, nothing. I'm lost.

I've been trying and wish I could find all the overworld models from kh1, but as far as Monstro goes, I have the version of him used in BbS mirage arena if this suits your needs at all? He's in pmx format since that's what I use but feel free to convert to whatever file type you need.
