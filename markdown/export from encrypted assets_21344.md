- Post Title: export from encrypted assets

Hi, 

I'm exporting unity assets from some projects, and I find the assets are all encrypted. There are only one file in the "assets" folder for each project. They are all named "data0.mp3". And unity studio can't export them.

And when I open them, I found they have different head, but have the same end:

> 0D 06 87 21 F9 A7 29 EE 41 6C CF C4 D1 66 E8 D5 B4 11 00 00

Is this encrypted by xor? or other method? Is there any tool or way to export it?

can anyone help me with the problem I seem to be having?

Any help is appreciate.
