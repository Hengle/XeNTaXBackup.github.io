- Post Title: help finding beta content on yugioh fm ps1

I do not speak English, I am using the google translator.
I am new to the forum, and I am trying to find beta content in the yugioh fm ps1, the game contains several files in MRG, could someone tell me if it is possible to extract them to see the textures or sprites of the game?
Here I leave the link of the game if someone can help me extract the files to see the images and textures
[http://www.mediafire.com/file/rf2n65cif ... ES.7z/file](http://www.mediafire.com/file/rf2n65cifrw5xad/YU-GI-OH_JAPONES.7z/file)

just open the bin file with ultraiso and extract the MRG files.
WA_MRG.MRG. (it is the file that contains all the cards of the game, characters and scenarios)
SU.MRG. (contains some images of the game)
MODEL.MRG (contains 3D models and maybe some junk files)

As far as I know, no beta content exists within the files of Forbidden Memories. Known unused content is listed at [The Cutting Room Floor](https://tcrf.net/Yu-Gi-Oh!_Forbidden_Memories). The best place to ask for help with this would probably be the [Forbidden Memories speedrunning Discord](https://discord.gg/ygofm).
