- Post Title: Time crisis 3d models

Anyone know how to rip arcade time crisis one models? This includes characters, maps, props, literally anything. Arcade would be preferred but playstation is always acceptable. I've tried to rip some stuff from playstation model rippers, but I have not had much luck. Any help would be appreciated.
