- Post Title: Unknown Raw Game Texture Format (TGA / DDS?)

Hello, I have come across an unknown raw game file texture format and need some help converting it. This is from a PS4 game, and I have attached two raw game file texture samples below. I'm not sure what it is but it could be a TGA file.

Texture Width (int16 2 bytes) seems to be at offset 0x38
Texture Height (int16 2 bytes) seems to be at offset 0x3A

Texture Data seems to start at offset 0x54?

Thanks for any help and anyone who could take a quick look, I appreciate it!
