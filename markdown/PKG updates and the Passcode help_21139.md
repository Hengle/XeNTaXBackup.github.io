- Post Title: PKG updates and the Passcode help

I'm sorry for my bad english for begging with it.
I've download a PKG file from ps4database and try to using with the the tool [PS4 Package Viewer](https://sites.google.com/site/theleecherman/ps4pkgviewer) made by leecherman and got failure to load content.
As I search, it was because it does need a Passcode for view update .PKG files, but, no matter were I search I cannot find much info about what exactly is a Passcode or how import it to the PS4 Package Viewer tool.
The PKG data I'm trying to view it is from the Monster Hunter Iceborn 


I'm not an user of PS4 or PS in general so I don't know much about how they work too.

That website is only for game patches and updates, not the games themselves.

Yes I know that, but for what the description says on the tool: it can read patch with the correct passcode. The problem is, it never explain how exactly import it or write it on the tool or let it recognize it.
