- Post Title: NFS Pro Street Audio Archives (TMX,ABK)

Hello everyone!  

I've managed to take a look at some NFS sound files (engines,skids,NOS,etc...) and found a program that extracts .ABK audio archives,but only for NFS MW 2005

The problem is - NFS Pro Street uses some sort of different compression.  

Here are the example files and as far as I know,TMX should contain about 10-18 audio files (And most likely they will be .WAV)

And here's the info about the exploration of MW 2005 ABK files (Might be useful)

It would be so amazing if you can make some sort of a tool for theese!  

Thanks in advance!
