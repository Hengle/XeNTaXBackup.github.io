I've seen people asking someone to mod this game so I decided to take up the task, But was hit by a brick wall when the files had no extensions and was just named 

1
2
3
4

yup no extension,  I was stunned how could 2K even do this?

If anyone could help this would be a god send!

Also let me know If I need to upload the files.

Other 2K PS2 and OG Xbox games have this same problem and it went to the ps3 with All Pro Football 2K8

If you can post one or more of the files, we can take a look at them.  Thanks!

I've had a look at that file.  I can't see any obvious file table, unless it's encrypted or compressed.  It may be that the file table is stored elsewhere.  I look into it a bit further ...
