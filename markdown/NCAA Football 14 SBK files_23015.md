- Post Title: NCAA Football 14 SBK files

Searching through some NCAA FB 14 files I came across these SBK files. when opened in a hex editor in plain text you can see SNR1 and SNS1(plus file type: SBKR) They are extremely small with the biggest ones being 426 Bytes. Ive inlcuded a Zip with 3 viles of the each of the 3 sizes. Any help would be appreciated!

These files may be headers for some EAAudioCore (EA Layer 3?) audio
