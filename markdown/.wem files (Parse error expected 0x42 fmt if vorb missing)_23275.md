- Post Title: .wem files (Parse error: expected 0x42 fmt if vorb missing)

Hello,

I'm trying to rip the audio from the game No Straight Roads to make mixes of the songs.

I extracted the .pak, found the audio, and tried converted the .wem files with divinity converter and ww2ogg.

As a result, I can convert some files to .ogg, but many are skipped over.  The only error I can find is the one in the post title suggesting the audio isn't encoded in vorbis.

My question is: how do I convert these other .wem files?

Any help would be appreciated.
Thank You.

Upload some of the ones that don't convert for others to take a look at

The site tells me .wem files are an invalid extension; I renamed one of the problem files .mp3 to post it.
I can only upload one file at a time as well, it seems.

Maybe I'm missing a setting for file sharing?

In any case,
Thank You

Upload it to a file hoster like Google Drive, OneDrive, Dropbox or MEGA

Try vgmstream, it can handle different wem formats
