.xfs uses technology developed by Digital image designs and was carried over into Rage software games.

Games known, to me, to use this format.
E-Racer, Rage Rally, and The cancelled Lamborghini for xbox. (Demo can still be found) all use this .xfs pack format. 

This is not to be confused with Xenesis File System format.

The E-Racer demo can be found at:

Lamborghini xbox demo can be found at:

Hello. I was able to figure out some values in this file format, but unfortunately 
it is not enough for now to make working extractor 

I have gathered all information we have in this article

I have great news! I was able to figure out whole file format,
you can see my documentation on this wiki article [http://wiki.xentax.com/index.php/Rage_Software_XFS](http://wiki.xentax.com/index.php/Rage_Software_XFS)

Also I have created extractor for E-Racer DEMO, if other games have the same file format,
it should work for others as well
[https://github.com/bartlomiejduda/Tools ... ls/E-racer](https://github.com/bartlomiejduda/Tools/tree/master/NEW%20Tools/E-racer)

I have put also in the same directory some goodies like hash dump, hook for E-Racer or hash function implementation,
it can be useful for someone in the future 

To decompress RA files you should use DecompRA from this link [download/file.php?id=10517](https://forum.xentax.com/download/file.php?id=10517)
