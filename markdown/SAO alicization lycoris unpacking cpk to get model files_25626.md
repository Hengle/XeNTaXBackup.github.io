- Post Title: SAO alicization lycoris unpacking cpk to get model files

Hello,
I tried to unpack the cpk files but it seemed that most of my files did not have their file type name. I guess I unpacked it in the wrong way.
I wanted to find some more information, but there seemed to be no more progress in this game model ripping.
May I ask if I can get some help with unpacking and ripping models of SAOAL?
