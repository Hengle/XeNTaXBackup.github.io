I know i'm not the best to answer, since i am kind of new to this, but decryption has nothing to do with the code you are using to decrypt the file.

As far as i know, and what i can see, the most common decrypted files here are 3D models, which, at first, maybe like you, i thought it was impossible but i am getting more or less how it works.

First of all you have to know what a 3D model is and how it is made, this is very intuitive and very easy to figure out how they are made, but in case you don't, this picture explains it very well, keep in mind we usually work with poly models:

Here are some guides i have been following all this time to get some clues.

If you are into MAXScript, this ones are great video tutorials on how to get models to 3DS max, the example from this video is Miku Miku Dance.

About other files, i don't really know, i would say that a decryption of a file is converting it to a file you already know how it works, so for example, if you are getting a ".asd" model, the best thing to start is to convert it to obj through C++, C#, etc.

I started using Maxscript since i get the results instantly.

I hope i helped out
