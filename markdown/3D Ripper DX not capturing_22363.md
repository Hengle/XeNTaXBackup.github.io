- Post Title: 3D Ripper DX not capturing

So I've been trying to use 3D Ripper DX to rip a scene from Deus Ex Human Revolution (On DX9 mode), but everytime I hit the capture button, the game crashes and I am left with a .3dr file.
When I import that 3dr file, it's completely empty.

I also have the export to obj box checked, but it does not export to obj
Is there something I'm doing wrong?

Same here, anyone figure it out. Besides 3d ripper, NinjaRipper rips models but the uv's are screwed up
