- Post Title: Disciples 3 problem

Hi guys,

I'm new to the forum, and the question I wanted to ask you (maybe you can help):

There is only a russian version of Disciples 3 as of today. But some guys at the disciples3.ru forums are translating the game into English.
Well, we thought, why not translate that English text into Hungarian, the texts are in plain TXT files.
Now that is our problem. Whenever we try é,ő,á,ó,ü,ö (common letters in Hungarian), in the game it shows up as random letters and signs.
YES, we tried to convert these letters with Diablo 2 converter, but same thing happens.

Is there something we haven't used yet?
Some help would be appreciated;)

Thank you in advance,
lostprophet

the font the game is using does not contain the character set you want it to use.
