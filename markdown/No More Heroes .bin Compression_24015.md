Can someone tell what kind of compression used in these files?

```
0x04 - Compressed Size
0x08 - Compressed Data
```

Solved. WOLF algorithm.

```
get ZSIZE asize
set SIZE long 0
if SIZE <= 0
    math SIZE = ZSIZE
    math SIZE *= 20
endif
comtype WOLF
string NAME p "%s.%s" NAME RSL
clog NAME 0 ZSIZE SIZE
```
