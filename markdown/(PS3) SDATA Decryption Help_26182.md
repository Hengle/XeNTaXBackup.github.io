- Post Title: (PS3) SDATA Decryption Help

Hello, I'm trying to decrypt files using SDATA 3.3.0 technology, I don't know much about it, so please forgive my ignorance. 

I did some quick research on this and found that there is some sort of program made for the PS3 that decrypts these files. Would I be able to do this on my computer or using RPCS3?
