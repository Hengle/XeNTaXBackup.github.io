- Post Title: how do you read unknown file formats?

Hi all, i'm gamedeveloper for 7 years and i wrote own file formats, but i don't understand how you reverse engineer them   
how do you read unknown file formats? is there any tutorials? 
i found 010 editor but still very hard to guess what data you get from there means.

take a read of our wiki -> [http://wiki.xentax.com/index.php?title=DGTEFF](http://wiki.xentax.com/index.php?title=DGTEFF)

essentially, with a basic understanding of data types, and a decent hex editor, you can start to block out data types and start making links between them.
