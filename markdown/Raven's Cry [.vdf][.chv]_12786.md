Hi there,

Requesting a script for this game format, if anyone has the interest and time, please.
The game has pretty nice pirate graphics. 

The textures are already in .DDS so no conversion for that is needed, the models are .vdf (static) and .chv (characters).
I uploaded many samples here (2mb): [https://www.dropbox.com/s/ic5jtvz77xcfm ... y.rar?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ic5jtvz77xcfmpo/RavensCry.rar?dl=0)

Thanks for your time!

Thanks shakotay2.

So, the format is simple?
Could anyone write a script for it? I'm really, really interested in this game.

lolwatt, you can extract models already:

1. unpack graphic.wd with this script: [viewtopic.php?p=103358#p103358](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?p=103358#p103358)
2. to convert models use one of the method:
      - blender script (with bones): [viewtopic.php?p=45899#p45899](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?p=45899#p45899)
      - noesis script (no bones): [viewtopic.php?p=100166#p100166](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?p=100166#p100166)

all thanks to authors [Thief1987](http://forum.xentax.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&u=39434), [Szkaradek123](http://forum.xentax.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&u=26056) and [deltaone](http://forum.xentax.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&u=33483).

Welcome to the RidersOfDeadHorses club!  
Yeah, those linked posts seem to have gone nowhere  . Here's the Noesis script from (Thief1987?, deltaone?, dunno).
"# based on Two Worlds II - model importer (.chv) by Szkaradek123"

Hey, sorry to necro an old post (again), I was wondering if anyone still has the other script, the blender (with bones) one. I would really appreciate any help, thanks!

The appended zip is for TwoWorlds II. I have no idea whether it applies to  Raven's cry, too.

Here you go (if Mariusz Szkaradek123 doesn't mind  ):
Remember that blender version 2.49b is required.
You can't use it with newer versions, nor with newer python versions > 2.62, afair.
Search the forum, it was explained about one hundred times for other 3D formats...
If you can't get it running you're lost then...
