I tried to replace cars in Need For Speed Hot Pursuit but it didn't work. I used Noesis with DGiorio's plugins. But I don't know how to replace a PC car with a PS3 car. Modders like DGiorio have created car mods for  both HP and HPR(BMW M3 GTR, Hot Rod, 2 DLC cars)and I want to do the same. Could anyone that knows how to mod cars tell me how to do it? 

Here are the PS3 car files: [https://mega.nz/#!ylEwBKoL!NByp2XdBKoxm ... sWB2jFqSsY](https://mega.nz/#!ylEwBKoL!NByp2XdBKoxmfLBBTWhhfllA5GrICG0pwsWB2jFqSsY)
