I was wondering if anyone had cracked the music files with in two Ubisoft related games

-Batman Vengeance
-Naruto: The Broken Bond

I have the actual files that contain the music files but I don't know how to crack them. Vengeance has this file name STREM.SM0 or in the xbox version STREM.SM2. I cracked most of the files from the PS2 version with Cube Media Player but some are still missing. Naruto has the files under a PK file format but its under these file names naruto_stream.sra and naruto_sound.sra. Someone had actually tried to rip the game before but only got a small percentage and gave up on it. I was able to determine that files exist by using the PK files through Foolbar2000 and contains some of the music and sfx with voice over cues. But again it wasn't complete.

I can PM them if anyone can take a look or could give me idea on how to extract them.
