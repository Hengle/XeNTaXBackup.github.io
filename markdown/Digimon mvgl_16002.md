Hi chrrox
I extracted Digimon mvgl files using your script, but I have no idea how to deal with the geom file.
I think the geom file is mesh? but Szkaradek123's guide doesn't work, error everytime.
Good news is, the anim file I extracted seems well in blender, so the geom file itself has no problem, I guess.
Much appreciate if you read thisÔºÅ
