- Post Title: Guild Wars 2 PF

Data archive files that are found inside of the GW2 dat archive. Presumed to be the successor to [FFNA](http://wiki.xentax.com/index.php/Guild_Wars_DAT).

There appears to be various different types based on the header (similar to FFNA). 

Anyone recognize anything about them
