Has anyone else been getting timeouts trying to access these forums? Since the end of October and until today (or some time in the last week - I don't check in every day) I just got a generic Chrome error page saying that the site was taking too long to respond.

I'm in Australia if that helps.

No, it's working fine for me. Maybe something is wrong with your internet provider?

Btw, you can try to change your browser to firefox or opera and see if it helps. :p

Ah good point - I didn't think of trying it on my phone instead.

Anyway, working now.
