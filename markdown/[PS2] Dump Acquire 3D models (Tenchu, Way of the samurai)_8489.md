- Post Title: [PS2] Dump Acquire 3D models (Tenchu, Way of the samurai)

Hello.
I've subscribed here a year ago reading and collecting all sorts of thing and it's my first time here trying to actualy dump PS2 files.
During a long time I thought this impossible before coming across this board and see that people achieved this goal.
The only problem is that it seems a lot of people here aren't just about to share models or how they actualy did to dump the files.

My try here is to extract 3D models from Way of the samurai 2.
I've been trying on other acquire games aswell and I find out that on PS2/PSP they all have the same files/archives.
My guess is that the 3D models are stored in the .DAT file that contains (for what I could read in some board) textures,audio and video.

Multiex didn't work or did Game extractor so I extracted the files with an old extractor software (I forgot the name its in russian)
and here is what I extracted so far:



And nothing seems able to read all theses files(yes I tried to import the .3Ds, without success)


I've seen people extracting models from Tenchu Shadows (Wii) but they don't explain how they do it.

Is anyone here able to help me please?

Thanks.

The 3ds files are just archives, not models.

Don't know, don't have the game nor the files.

You can rip from Tenchu Shadow Assassin using Dolphin and 3D Ripper
