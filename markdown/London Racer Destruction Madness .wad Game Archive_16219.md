Test unpack script for QuickBMS. Files extracting without original names, because i can't get any info from file, which can be pointing to filename strings. Strange format.

```
get dummy long
get namesSz long

goto namesSz 0 SEEK_CUR 

get unk1 long
get unk2 long
get offsetsCnt long

print "Reading offsets.."
for I = 1 to offsetsCnt
    get curOffset long
    putArray 0 I curOffset
next I
print "Sorting array. Please wait.."
sortArray 0

getArray fOffset 0 1

for j = 2 to offsetsCnt    
    getArray nextOffset 0 j
    xmath fSize "nextOffset - fOffset"
    log "" fOffset fSize
    math fOffset = nextOffset
next j

```


Format specification, how I presume:

```
int32 {4}  Unknown (dummy)
int32 {4}  File Names Block size (0x48EB0)

//File Names Block:
  // null delimited strings of filenames, folders, etc.

//Offsets Block:
  int32 {4} Unknown (0x00486D)
  int32 {4} Unknown (0x000912)
  int32 {4} Offsets\Files count (0x0000621C)
        //For each:
          uint32 {4} File Offset
#Size of Offsets block: 0x1887C

//Info Block
  # 16 bytes buffer for each file?
   bytes {4} Unknown #Offset to filename string? Almost all not exact point to start of string.
   bytes {4} Unknown
   bytes {4} Unknown
   bytes {4} Unknown (dummy)
#Size of Info Block 0x517F0

```


I don't have more ideas. Maybe somebody can complement.
