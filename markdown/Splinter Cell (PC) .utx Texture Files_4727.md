Hey guys,

Is there any program apart from Unreal Ed (I get a runtime error when importing) that can inject .utx files with edited images?

The .utx files are full of 24-bit bitmap images which I can easily extract but I can't get them back in.


Example file:

You cannot do this without re serializing the entire package.

If the game comes with ucc.exe (maybe under ..\system) you could use it. I think you can export an utx package, edit the files and recreate it with ucc but as iservealot says its not possible to inject it.
