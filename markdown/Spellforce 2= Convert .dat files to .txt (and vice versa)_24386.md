- Post Title: Spellforce 2= Convert .dat files to .txt (and vice versa)

I'm trying to translate Spellforce 2 Demons of the Past to another language. I've managed to extract the language files from english.cff files, using a tool I found in this forum.

The cuestion is that the .dat files containing the game dialogs are compiled and You have to edit them with a HexEditor. I discovered a guy that could transform these files to .txt, translate them and then transform the txt translated back to .dat file. 

I need a tool/script than can convert from between these two formats. I managed to find an example (attached) of the original .dat file and the decompiled .txt format.
