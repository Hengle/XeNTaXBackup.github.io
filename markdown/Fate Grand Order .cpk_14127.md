- Post Title: Fate Grand Order .cpk

Hello! I'm a freshly registered user of xentax, previously, when the registration required a 5$ donation, I was an asshole who used a free account of others, to get the stuff that I needed, I didn't leech them, just used them myself (being full asshole isn't good)

That was a brief introduction. The reason why I registered is to ask for help or most probably for an "education" I'm trying to get past the Fate / Grand Order .cpk files, the problem is that it doesn't have a TOC file, and the tool cpk_unpacker isn't able to do anything with it. I will attach screenshots of the .cpk in case someone gets interested. I myself only wish to get the sounds out of it, but mostly I want to know the ecnryption and a way how to deal with it.

Sadly I can't attach the file, as the limitation is 256kbites, but I will attach an external link to mediafire, I hope it will be okay.

As you can see, this is a CPK file, nothing wrong at the header.

Moving on we stumble on offset 00000800 and we don't have a TOC, meaning that the tool is unable to find any files without it.

Is that the full CPK archive or just a segment of it?

That is a full cpk file, a part of many. This one contains some set of sounds. I didn't want to pick the biggest one.

This is from alpha build, and the cpks are masked as cpk.bytes I can upload the whole package of files if you want 

Edit1: A correction to my own sentence, these file are from cache, aka I ran the game and extracted the cache where it saved all files.

if it downloads all these you can most likely just use a proxy and grab the direct links for the files then download them on pc.

Never actually done it, but most probably it's a go-to, as if there is a game -> cache -> mobile connection, most probably the data is getting packed from game side, but I don't really have much knowledge of it, that's why I went directly to the cpk files ;< But I see what you mean, thanks for the info
