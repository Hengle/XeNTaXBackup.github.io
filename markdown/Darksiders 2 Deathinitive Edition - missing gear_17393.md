- Post Title: Darksiders 2 Deathinitive Edition - missing gear

Long story short, I'm playing a Steam install of DS2:DE & when I tried to play the Abyssal Forge campaign, all of my gear is missing. I have my skills/equipment, but gear (soul splitter, etc.) is missing, so I can't proceed at all. I can't find ANY references to this issue on Google; THQ Nordic isn't replying to support requests; any help would be appreciated.
