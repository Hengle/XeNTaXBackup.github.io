- Post Title: Can't convert some .43 mesh files in KTANE

I tried to convert some .43 unity mesh files from Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes with this tool here: [http://www.vg-resource.com/attachment.php?aid=5617](http://www.vg-resource.com/attachment.php?aid=5617)

It worked with some, but with other mesh files it gives an error. For example, this file here: [https://www.dropbox.com/s/i3ygpm5as313c ... 00.43?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/i3ygpm5as313cjp/BackingPiece%28Clone%29%200.43?dl=0) cannot be converted, while this file:[https://www.dropbox.com/s/hmj6uhdng7yr7 ... 1.obj?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/hmj6uhdng7yr7tq/Bomb_frame%28Clone%29%201.obj?dl=0) can.

Does anyone know how I could possibly convert that mesh to obj? Any help would be appreciated.

unsure about uvs - maybe the twelve buttons are created by a bump map or something like that?

Wow, that's a really convenient tool! If it's not a burden, could you please convert this model: [https://www.dropbox.com/s/eaj0turgil7h2 ... 00.43?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/eaj0turgil7h2jb/Bot_case%28Clone%29%200.43?dl=0) to obj and send it to me? I know that may be asking a lot, but this is the only model I need. Thanks in advance!

(use File/SaveAs mesh to get the obj file)
