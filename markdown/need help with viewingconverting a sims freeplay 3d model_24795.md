- Post Title: need help with viewing/converting a sims freeplay 3d model

hello fellow humans
I need help either viewing the attached .m3g file from The Sims Freeplay &/or converting the mesh. I already tried [https://sourceforge.net/projects/wz-m3gvw/](https://sourceforge.net/projects/wz-m3gvw/) for simple file viewing & the m3g2fbx tool for actual conversions, but both didn't work. According to the other sims freeplay thread I can use hex2obj to convert the model, but I've got no skills or time to learn(hopefully both will change in the future).

Basically, does anyone know of convenient, easy-to-use different tools for viewing/converting m3gs?
I'd also appreciate help converting the model if you've got time, motivation, & hex2obj knowledge, but it's not needed, my main priority is the 1st bit.
Thanks
