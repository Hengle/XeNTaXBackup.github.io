It's the same format  (.bnk) except with the demo they have put all files in a .big format just for the beta.

Cause the directory for the beta is: (Example)
C:\Program Files (x86)\Atari\TDU2 Demo\Euro\Bnk\bigfile1.big

You mean there will be no .BIG in the full version of the game? Just .bnk as in TDU1?

Yes.   

Cause why would the TDU2 beta path be "C:\Program Files (x86)\Atari\TDU2 Demo\Euro\Bnk"  In saying they are using the .BNK, they may of changed coding of it to make any mod tools no longer read. I don't think it would take long to notice changes within coding if they have done such a thing.


Along in the beta they have a file dedicated to Shaders, these files are .SOB.  TDU1 I could never find their shaders but then again it was ruled by HDR and such.
