- Post Title: Syndicate @2012 - Text Repacker *.xcr

Can anyone please have a look on this files.
Attached are two files for example: 
STRINGTABLE_ENG.XCR contains the text of the game menu and journal; CREDITS_1.XCR - creators of the game. 
The file structure is similar with all the files *.xcr files Starbreeze engine.

You also need "All.xcd"! I've seen someone translate Syndicate, so it is possible, but maybe their tools are not public.

I know. For All.xcd I have a script in Python, made one good man. Left to deal with the *.xcr files.
