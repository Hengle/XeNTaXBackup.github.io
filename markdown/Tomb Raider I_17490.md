Hi, I want to translate Tomb Raider 1 (1996) into my language. I am able to change texts in the menu but I also want to add subtitles to cutscenes. Is it possible to add subtitles to cutscene.phd files?

No.
But someone actually managed to add texts to cutscenes in 4th game with reverse engineering, even though it didn't support subtitles. There is currently a language patch for Last Revelation right now. And I can't reach the ones who made it however as I much do want to ask them how they even did that.

It's nothing to do with level files. Cutscene subtitles are likely a script legend override plus binary patch.

Someone who translated the game managed to add subtitles with a filing system. I'm giving you the link of the patch in case you wanna check out. The translation files have '.bsrt' extension. I still have no idea how they are shown in-game or how they are syncronized.
