- Post Title: Fantasy life Online - issue with getting texts

Hello 
Can someone help me getting text assets files from a mobile game (Fantasy life Online)
I've gotten the texture2D files such as photos effects ect But I'm wanting the text files such as "This character buff %" 
I had someone in the discord show me these but they have since left and I'm to learn how to do these myself :L

First, you should figure out which engine is used by the game (is it Unity, Unreal or custom).

Then you should first find the texts in the game files (if they are not compressed on encrypted)
Here is a good tutorial for this [https://ikskoks.pl/searching-text-strin ... commander/](https://ikskoks.pl/searching-text-strings-using-total-commander/)

Then - when you already know which files contain text, you can open them in hex editor to examine them.
You can also post links to some samples here if you have issue with figuring out the file format of the specific files.
And then maybe someone will help you.
