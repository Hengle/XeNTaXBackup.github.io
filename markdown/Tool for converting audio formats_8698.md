- Post Title: Tool for converting audio formats

What kind of tools do people use for decoding audio formats? Are there any popular tools that support the addition of proprietary formats?

Is there a tool that does something like parse some arbitrary audio file, then export to common formats like wav, mp3, or ogg.
Kind of like noesis except for audio files.

[Audacity](http://audacity.sourceforge.net/) and [MFAudio](http://www.zophar.net/utilities/ps2util/mfaudio-1-1.html) can do this with some success.

Well, vgmstream is a playback library that works with winamp that can decode popular formats or use it as a standalone application with the test.exe application provided with it.
