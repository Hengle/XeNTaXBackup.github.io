if gcfscape doesn't work with that file isn't more simple to contact the author and asking him to give a look?
he already knows everything about the gcf format so if it's a small thing to change for him is a joke to update the tool or maybe he will tell you what's wrong with that file.
then if you have an update (positive or negative) you can post the information here
