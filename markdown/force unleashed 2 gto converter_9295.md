This has been answered elsewhere on this forum. Please use the search function next time. But TFU2 gto files are zip files. Rename any got you want from, say, "playerdagobah.gto" to "playerdagobah.zip" and unzip the contents. The file you get will not have any file extension on it, so then add ".gto" and use the Noesis plugin on that file.

Well,


I've done everything up to the 'Noesis' part, and yet now I cannot find any .gto plugin for Noesis. Anywhere, I've spent several hours looking for it. So could someone either point me in the right direction or upload it here as an attachment?

It's not for Blender. It is plugin for Noesis [https://richwhitehouse.com/index.php?co ... project=91](https://richwhitehouse.com/index.php?content=inc_projects.php&showproject=91)

Just put plugin file in the plugins directory and open GTO file in Noesis.
