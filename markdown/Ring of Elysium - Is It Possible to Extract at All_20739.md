- Post Title: Ring of Elysium - Is It Possible to Extract at All?

Hello, as the title says, I'm wondering if anyone knows of a way to rip models from Ring of Elysium.

I've tried my hand at scripts that can open the SFC files but with ROE they all come out corrupt.

After that, I tried NinjaRipper, however this game won't launch without it starting through Steam, so I attempted to just place the DLLs in the ROE directory as I have with games like GTA 5 and Watch_Dogs 2, but when I try to extract, nothing happens.

Does anyone know of any way to actually get models out of the game? Trying to rip characters like Elliott and such. Any help would be greatly appreciated!

Please, use search function. Don't think, that we are thinking about different games, right? Is this Ring of Elysium game, that you have in mind?

You could ask about archive extraction in this thread too, I'm sure someone could help you out! User who sent me model samples, for sure knows how to extract all files correctly

Yeah that's the same game. This thread is pretty recent so it wasn't really showing up when I was Googling how to do this. If someone figured out how to pull from the game's archives, though, that'd be great.

To launch Ring of Elysium and many other tencent's games with NinjaRipper,you need to delete D3DX9_43.dll and d3dx11_43.dll.
