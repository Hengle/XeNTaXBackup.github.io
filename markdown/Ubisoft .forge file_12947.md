- Post Title: Ubisoft .forge file

If anyone knows how to extract scimitar files (heres an example file, [http://www.mediafire.com/download/wsn64 ... urls.forge](http://www.mediafire.com/download/wsn64qr83r03ilb/Data360_CaliforniaGurls.forge)) please help. I've tried to use Maki with all the plugins but whenever it tries to extract a file it just ends up with a 3kb file ending in 005.
Does anyone have better program?
