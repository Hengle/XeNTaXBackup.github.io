- Post Title: Kingdoms of Amalur meshes and textures.

Im trying to extract meshes and textures from Kingdoms of Amalur Reckoning. Specifically, I'd like to extract my own character but I'm quite sure that's not possible and thus I'd like all of the Dokkalfar meshes and textures so I can put them together myself in milkshape or something alike.
I'm not sure what programs to use, so far I've found xRaptors [http://raptor.cestiny.cz/download/kingd ... actor.html](http://raptor.cestiny.cz/download/kingdoms-of-amalur-reckoning-big-files-extractor.html)

Haven't found any meshes yet, but I did find plenty of DDS files, which I can't open in Photochop CS3 for some reason. So my questions are:
Why can't I open the DDS files? I have the plugins necessary.
How and where do I find the meshes for this?
Are there any other programs I should use?

Thanks and hope I put this in the right section!

Okay, unfortunately I have no idea how to do that!

that's rather simple by using a hex editor.
If you don't know "how to",
there's also a quickbms script, iirc. Use forum search to find it. (btw: it's possible to do a search in search results.)

There should be hints in this forum how to use the quickbms.exe, too.

Ah alright, thanks I'll give it a shot!    Adding another question: I tried using 3dReaperdx for the meshes but the game crashed. Is that normal? Haven't happened to any other game.
