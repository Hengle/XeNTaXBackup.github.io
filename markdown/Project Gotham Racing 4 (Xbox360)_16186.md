Hey guys  

First time posting here. I was wondering if anyone knows how to extract 3d models from PGR4 as that game has an interesting roster of vehicles that aren't present in other games of the genre. 
Last year, I've sent an e-mail to Luigi Auriemma and he kindly created a script that can decompress the PAK_HRD files but there's no tool (that I know of) that can read the 3d data and texture data from those files. 
I really wanted to get one specific car model from this game: The Lamborghini Diablo VT 6.0 SE; Other than PGR3 and PGR4 the only games that had the 6.0 VT were old NFS titles (Hot Pursuit 2 and another one I can't remember the title) but on PGR3 and PGR4 the model's geometry is far superior. 

I have no idea how to write parsers, otherwise I'd do it so if anyone is willing to lend a helping hand on this I'd seriously appreciate it 

Edit: I've uploaded a zip with the car's pak_hrd file.

And here's the Quickbms script to use on PGR4 pak_hrd and pak files
