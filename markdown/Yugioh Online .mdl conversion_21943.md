- Post Title: Yugioh Online .mdl conversion

hey guys.
I recently came across a archive that got a bunch of .mdl files from the yugioh online 3 game.
the game got quite a bunch of characters with decent models and since yugioh doesnt get any 3d love for the characters they are probably the best models for most characters.
Anyone could check out the sample .mdl to see if it possible to convert it to a usable format? Only the mesh and uvs would be fine. Doesnt realy need to have skinning or normals.

Can you point to the original archive? I do a lot of work on Yugipedia and am interested in it for archival and documentation purposes.
