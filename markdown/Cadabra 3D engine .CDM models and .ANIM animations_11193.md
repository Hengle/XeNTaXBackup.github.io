I am not much of a begger, but I had to make an exception.
I downloaded a "catfight" fighting game demo made in the Cadabra 3D Engine, that uses private formats for models (.CDM) and animations (.ANIM). The engine, so as the game, was cancelled, and became abandonware, so, no problem with copyrights.

I'd like to see if somebody here, already experienced in 3D programming, could give me a hand to extract these models (Only three: The two bikini girls and the stage) and their animations (The girls only), and convert them to known formats (i.e. blend or max, and FBX). 

Here's the link to the game:

If it's in the wrong thread, please, move it to the right one. Thanks.
