- Post Title: Star Trek A Final Unity Sprite Rip

Did anyone ever do a good rip of this games sprites?  I can't find one, so I took a look, but the problem seems to be multiple-folds:
1) Finding the right palette (where are they for most of the mission ones??)
2) Decompressing perfectly the blocks (ScummVM seems to not have sprite data for all sprites)

All I did was reuse the ScummVM code (impressive job whoever did it).  But some sprites were missing data for sprite, and a lot of palettes seem to not be "bridge.rm", which is the one I used (unless had a palette chunk in the .spr, then used that).  If anyone has perfected this, be great to know how to.  

Some examples (good and bad):




It also seems like FVF movie ripping is plausible since ScummVM from what I can tell appears to support it, though I didn't do it.  Wonder what bustrip.fvf is?

Img are just gif, just need rename them.

Also did a scan of text, the .bst files:
