- Post Title: (beta)Testers needed!

I'm looking for people who are willing to cooperate (voluntarily) in creating future versions of MultiEx Commander. 

I'm looking for people that either /b]

- have a spare system and are not afraid of clean-installing their OS on that machine (Win98, WinNT, Win2000, WinXP) prior to testing
- test future (setup) versions, at the (low) risk of having to reinstall the OS when the setup fails (again, low risk)

Or /b]

- are not afraid of testing future versions on their main machines

In principle, all OS are needed. 

Please apply here, and I will add you to a list. You will recieve a mail with a download location whenever there's a new version. 

Apply at my mail mr.mouse@xentax.com !

All testers will be mentioned in future releases of course.
