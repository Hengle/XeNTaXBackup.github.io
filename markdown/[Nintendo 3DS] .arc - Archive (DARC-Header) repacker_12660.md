- Post Title: [Nintendo 3DS] .arc - Archive (DARC-Header) repacker?

Hey Guys,

Right now, I want to modify a Nintendo 3DS Game ([https://gbatemp.net/threads/harvest-moo ... xt.382612/](https://gbatemp.net/threads/harvest-moon-a-new-beginning-scripts-etc-in-plain-text.382612/)).
I'm able to modify all code-based scripts and music.
But to customize the game completely, I need a way to repack this .arc-files and xbb-files ([viewtopic.php?f=21&t=12649&start=15](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=21&t=12649&start=15)).

And there are some .arc-files which I can open with EveryFileExplorer, a program that allows viewing the files in the archive.

And now I want to know: is there a way to unpack and repack .arc files or possibly, create new .arc files with own files inside of it.

FILE FORMAT: [http://3dbrew.org/wiki/ARC](http://3dbrew.org/wiki/ARC)

I've uploaded such a file

I also uploaded a Screenshot with much informations about this uploaded file.

Right now, there's only this viewer+exporter available for this file format, but not a unpacker/repacker or editor :/
It would be VERY useful if you can help me with this :>

Thank you Mr.Mouse 
Now I understand this format a bit more  
I hope I find someone who could write a standalone executable which is able to repack this file format.

I'Ve uploaded a image which shows all files and folders in this file.

/bump it again

I really want to modify these files, but there's no tool for it yet :/

I will pay 5€ for a working tool and 10€ more if you can make me a Tool to extract/rebuild xbb-files + a pp-file editor (the files inside of the xbb-files).
I know... it's not very much. I'm only a student with a small Income :/

You can bump all you want, but I do not think it will help. I reckon it's costing too much time for those who could help out. Perhaps 
GovanifY can still be of help, when he does get the time.

Why such a hurry, ChrisX930? Do you have a deadline or something?

I checked your first link, and there's some guy working on python script for this. He almost did it, the only thing left is to make proper padding. And he said 5 days ago that he's working on it. It's not that hard, he just needs to make all files start on the 128-byte boundary.

I see at least 3 people were working on some tools for you for this game. And they made some packers/unpackers and many of those are working and you have sources of those.

Can you summarize now what is already done, and what is still needed, so if anyone wants to help you, he mustn't do it all from scratch?
