Hmm, Szkaradek123, do you know about blender importer for NIF-files? [http://sourceforge.net/projects/niftool ... f_scripts/](http://sourceforge.net/projects/niftools/files/blender_nif_scripts/)

Nice, I've been wanting to add nif to my converter cause doing it one by one wasn't feasible (plus exporting in obj loses stuff), but didn't have any working reference to compare the results with.

Maybe I could write a parser that will also use nif xml files.

Sorry to be bumping up an old thread, but I have a question. How do I use this? It's a .blend file, so do I just open it in blender? I'm really new to this stuff, so sorry. ^^;

I tried Szkaradek123 blender importer and most of .nif not work(Saber black suite, Kiritsugu, Irisviel)
I got this 
normal(9000polys)-low(2000polys)-high(11000polys)

Still don't know where is her head. May be all girls model use the same head

MicroVolts deattach models to hair, head, upper, under
with Irisviel, the script only work with under. Other part I have same error as 4uTeP

It doesn't help to know that you got a syntax error.

It from MicroVolts aka H.A.V.E. Online aka ToyWars
[http://www.fpsreport.com/official-sites ... sites.html](http://www.fpsreport.com/official-sites/226-have-official-sites.html)

Fate Zero pack contain Kiritsugu, Irisviel, Maiva, Saber, Tohsaka, Gilgamesh for ToyWars(JP). I don't know if other countries have this pack or not

texture is dds, model is nif. All nif tool can't import it (only got bone)

Szkaradek123 blender import can get model but not all of nif will work with it.
I like Irisviel very much, but the script only can import her under model T_T
