- Post Title: [REQ] Whiteday (2001) .fnt and .wft files

Hello. I am working on a Russian translation project for a game called Whiteday. By whichever miracle, this game, albeit having been released only in Korean,  happens to use a font, which contains characters for many languages, rather than just Korean. But the problem is that the built-in Russian characters are terrible, to say the least. The characters seem to be "cut-off" on the right side and the spacing is way too wide, forcing me to use less words per line, and subtitles are limited to only three lines.

Korean fans have told me that a Chinese team used a program, called CrystalTile, to add Chinese characters to the game, so I assume the files are tile-based images. I've had no luck with the program so far. So I'm asking for help with defining this format. Even a simple CrystalTile tutorial, to help me edit the files, would be good. What I want to do is replace the Russian characters within the image with more decent ones and edit the the spacing.

P.S. I'm kind of desperate....
