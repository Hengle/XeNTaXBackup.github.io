- Post Title: Zone of the Enders *.DAT Munge Files

I've done a little research into the matter, and this is about what I already know.

For Zone of the Enders 2nd Runner, in a folder called ZOE2 is:
MOVIE.DAT, VOX.DAT, DEMO.DAT, STAGE.DAT

Zone of the Enders has *.DAT files as well.

which I know are konami munge files, and the issue has been addressed before with extracting resources from the Metal Gear Solid games.

I've been able to use KonamiDat.exe and MGS2Movie.exe to get some viewable PSS/M2V streams out of MOVIE.DAT but the audio is the issue here. I've heard the term 'Konami Wave' used before, but I'm not entirely certain what compression that is, what codec I would need, or how to convert it. Also I don't know if the compression is some other type of ADPCM, etc.

The filetypes I'm getting that seem to possibly be audio are: *.RAW from MGS2Movie, or *.BIN from KonamiDat.exe, KonamiDat.exe also throws out some *.SUB and *.UNK

I've also tried using KonamiDat.exe on VOX.DAT and the files just sound like static.

Also a note: I've run the game in PCSX2 and before every movie file (and thus audio as well) it refers to sector 2573, so somewhere around there could possibly be the proprietary codec for the audio, but right now I can't make anything of it.

If anyone has extensive experience with extracting from Metal Gear Solid or other Konami games, the insight will be much appreciated.

I'd be interested in this as well. I've been after the in-game music of MGS3 for quite a while now.

Zone Of The Enders 1 .DATs and the other DAT files have different formats, as ZOE1 format can be opened with Xpert.
