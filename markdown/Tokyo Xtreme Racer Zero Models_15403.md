- Post Title: Tokyo Xtreme Racer Zero Models

Hello all. I started to develop a server for a discontinued Genki game: SBOL. I have the latest available client 2.00.03 which has 69 models of the 98~ models that the game uses so when trying to load these missing models it reports that it is unable to open the file and crashes the client. I suspect clients got these from the patch server (when it was live). Google searches aren't bringing up any results for these files. An example of a file I need is SW20G.mmdl. Its the non turbo MR2. but the client did come with SW20GT.mmdl this is slightly different. But I hear that SBOL is based off of Tokyo Xtreme Racer Zero a PS2 game so I could potentionally fill in the gaps using models from this game. However the models in the PS2 game are compressed. But can see around 134~ models in the data file. Has anyone had any experience extracting models from the tokyo xtreme racer series? The model formats from SBOL and TXR0 contain the same header "LDM" so suspect it just the compression I need to get passed.

Any advise would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks.

This is very good news, you were able to run the client at this stage?

Unfortunately I am afraid that it is not possible at the moment, since the game does not use the known method of compression archive of the entire series could currently only unpack archives Wangan Midnight [PS3] exactly what you need to ask the author of the program Quick BMS.
