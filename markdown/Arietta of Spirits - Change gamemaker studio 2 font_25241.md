UndertaleModTool should work just fine for font editing. 
Check out the screenshot I took while I was playing with this tool [http://wiki.xentax.com/index.php/File:U ... tool_1.png](http://wiki.xentax.com/index.php/File:Und_mod_tool_1.png)

Here is an article for this [http://wiki.xentax.com/index.php/GameMaker_DAT_WIN](http://wiki.xentax.com/index.php/GameMaker_DAT_WIN)
You can see other tools in "Compatible Programs" section, if you need something else.

Tks for reply me, so if I want to edit font I need to export font png and edit it with pts and reimport it, right?

Have a better ways to just pts the png font file, but unfortunately, trying to repack the game.win will give the error so you can not repack it even with a clean game.win without modded, using undertale mod tool newest version got same error.

Hello XeNTax forum, I have a problem want to solve: How to ex/im font and add characters to gamemaker studio 2 font, I use undertalemodtool or do you have any suggestion tools please tell me, tks!

I know how to create and edit fonts for this engine.
It's a lot of work to do, I learned it by translating the game "Record of Lodoss War-Deedlit in Wonder Labyrinth-"

I translated it to the brazilian portuguese language.

If you are lucky and it is the same pattern it takes 2 days to make the font.
