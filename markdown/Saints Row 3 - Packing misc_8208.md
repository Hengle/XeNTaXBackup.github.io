- Post Title: Saints Row 3 - Packing misc

Hi all,

I unpacked misc.vpp_fc file by using Gibbed.Volition.Unpack.exe. It became a misc file and I changed menu_us.le_strings. It became a menu_us.le_strings.txt file. What do I need to do to show this modification in the game? 

Please, help me. I can't pack misc file  I will use Gibbed.Volition.Pack.exe to unpack?
