- Post Title: [Android] Blade Xload Asset files

[https://play.google.com/store/apps/deta ... lord&hl=ja](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=jp.co.applibot.bladexlord&hl=ja)

Original files AssetStudio can't read.
I use HxD delete first line"09 08 06 01" and change fifth word to "55"(U).
Then AssetStudio can read mesh and some image files,
But character hair texture, animation and many image files can't read yet.
I think issue is file headline have something wrong.
Anyone can help me?
