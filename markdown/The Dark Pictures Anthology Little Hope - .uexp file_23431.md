- Post Title: The Dark Pictures Anthology: Little Hope - .uexp file

Hey,

I want to localize Little Hope, but the existing Man Of Medan export/import tool isn't working properly on Little Hope. If anyone is interested coding a tool for it, the link for the .uexp file of Little Hope is down below.

If you want to adapt the Man Of Medan export/import tool to Little Hope, I can share the source codes. Just contact me through PM.
