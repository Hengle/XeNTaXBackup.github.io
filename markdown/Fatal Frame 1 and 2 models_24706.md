I cannot help you get any models, but if you want to get what's inside the IMG_BD.bin of Fatal Frame 3 use this tool called Zero Unpacker.

works like a charm and I have everything extracted from that file, however I can do very little with it outside of the cutscenes because I cannot figure out how it's supposed to go together. Most of the files are .pk4 files that I cannot seem to get anything to read and the only information I have on them is that they belong to the idtech4 engine. I'm really not sure they do. any help on the subject would be greatly appreciated. 

As a side note, I was able to rip all the cutscenes which is neat.
