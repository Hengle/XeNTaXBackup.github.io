Hello. Does anyone know how to extract b2container files in Unreal engine in Gears 5.   I would like to extract text for translation.

Gears 5 uses oodle compression for b2container.
The GearGame.b2index file contains information about B2 container names, file names, and their location and size in b2containers.
There should be localization texts in Launch.b2container.
Could someone create a bms script to unpack the files?

Did you manage to extract all files successfully with the ravioli tool? Because for me it gives some .riff files and I can't go further than that.

The b2index file contains very important info. Maybe the lack of that info is what causing deficient archives. I am also working on that with python scripts now.

Does the b2container include audio files as well?
Because i'm interested into dump all the voicelines/music from Gears 5, but to my knowledge as of right now, it is not possible to do so...
Thank you for any suggestion!

I saw a man who extracted some of the textures from gears 5 today on deviantart. That's a good improvement. Just wanted to let know who's anyone interested. I hope that there will be more content soon.

The deviations I have seen are:

Guys that I've discovered the other day says that they completely extracted gears archives. There's a few renders and a pic of sound files from those guys' page. And since this guys claim that they extracted content completely, maybe it can be useful for you too.

Sadly the software you're referring to has a pretty bad reputation:

[viewtopic.php?f=33&t=22739](https://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=33&t=22739)

[https://zenhax.com/viewtopic.php?p=58892#p58892](https://zenhax.com/viewtopic.php?p=58892#p58892)

Also, it's behind a great pay wall which make me wanna skip on that tool.

Looking at the decompressed file posted at Gildor

Vertex
[](https://ibb.co/WvMN2RF)
Assumed uv

Faces

Render
The uv's looked a strange in MR.

So I decided to open the file and check them.

Well after dumping files and exploring with Model Researcher I found this if anyone can make a tool.

The format is very similar to standard UE4, with only minor changes. I got the skinned mesh loaded with the skeleton. Can you PM me few more samples so that I can see if it works with them?

You can also follow umodel related development for the game in [respective game topic](https://www.gildor.org/smf/index.php/topic,6790.msg41379.html#msg41379). Though at the point it's better to improve or at least to fix extraction script, as currently it's a bit bugged.
