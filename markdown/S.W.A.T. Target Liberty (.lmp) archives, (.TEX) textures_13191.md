- Post Title: S.W.A.T. Target Liberty (*.lmp) archives, (*.TEX) textures

Hello everybody,  I would like to ask for help because I have some problems with Re-searcing and making MexScript for MultiEx Commander to support lmp archives of SWAT game  
It's a psp game develoled by 3G Studios and published by Sierra. 
Release date: October 26, 2007.
Additional help by CarLuver69

I've already started a script for open this archives, I could get the string table of the files but after it I couldn't get anything

Samples of lmp archives: [http://www.mediafire.com/download/tzfn7 ... pfiles.rar](http://www.mediafire.com/download/tzfn7r1n7r3lvr8/lmpfiles.rar)

ok noone would like to help or everybody is too busy for helping out? 

by the way I tried to make a tool for it with using c# 

now I can open and export files from LMP archives but I still have a little problem with opening and converting textures to .png
Some of textures are good but the others not ... 



We tried to open it  with Dageron's Console Texture Explorer tool but it looks that the palette is not well.
Could anyone help please? 

 

Samples of .TEX (texture) files 
What we know: The textures are swizzled, bpp 8, graphics offset: 640
