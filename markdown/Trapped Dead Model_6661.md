Python script for import geometry and uv - mapping for Blender249. (Grotesque Tactics: Evil Heroes - too)
Bones - not.
Open script in Text Window and press alt+p

Like to be able to get the vmesh assets too for this game. (buildings/props etc.)

Any chance this could be added to the blender script?
