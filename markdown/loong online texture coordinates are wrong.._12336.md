- Post Title: loong online: texture coordinates are wrong..

hey,

i have a problem with noesis and the files from loong online. it loads everything fine to noesis but the texture coordinates are wrong at every single file. i cant figure out what i am doing wrong, because i have normally downloaded the plugins from    
finale00Â´s dropbox folder (thanks for all). and as you can see here: viewtopic.php?f=16&t=8137&start=15
it should normally work..xD (also not work for .fskin..)

here is a screenshot: [](http://www.bilder-upload.eu/show.php?file=ab11ce-1417825304.jpg)

thanks for helping guys!!!
