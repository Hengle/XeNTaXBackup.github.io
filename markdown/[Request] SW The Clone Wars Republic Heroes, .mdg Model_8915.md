Yes, another post requesting a SW TCW: Republic heroes tool/script:

Chrrox made a 3D max .mdg script for the Blade Kitten - PC version ([viewtopic.php?p=44598#p44598](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?p=44598#p44598)), i tryed the script in the SW .mdg but get a error (what was already expected) the format looks to be the same, and, i need help to find a way of importing this model (this means a script)

I will be grateful to those who do it!,thanks you for your attention.

Here's a sample file of the .mdg (or download by the attachment)

i second this, someone has already extracted models from this game via game assassin ( and it's the only 1 released) but since it's hard as hell to use, using a program like noesis or a 3ds max plugin would be awesome

Hi

Here is importer for textured models (.mdl) from this game.
I use file research done by chrrox  from [viewtopic.php?p=43126#p43126](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?p=43126#p43126).

It requires Blender version 249 and Python 26.

Steps:
1.  unpack importer
2.  run Blender249.blend
3.  in Blender Text Window press alt+p and select mdl file

It supports weighting and import skeleton.

Thanks for the script, works great!  
Though, i'm confused on the textures. With the script the diffuse textures get automatically converted, but the norm maps don't. I tried to add a dds header to one of the norm maps, which was a head texture and that worked fine, but I tried the same thing on the body norm map and was unable to get a good result. Any idea why that texture wont work correctly? Ive tried using DXT3 and 5, doesn't help.

EDIT: The problem happens with some characters' head norm textures too :/

Hi

@TRDaz

I can't help you. I use Texturefinder and nothing found.

Example.

guess it is. But who would?
Doesn't make much sense (for me) if there is an existing solution.

I was thinking about creating some kind of autotranslator for python 2.6 to Noesis script
but I'm lacking the time.

> Cause i don't know jack crap about blender only 3ds max and maya.
just kidding?
It's a 10 minutes job to download/install blender 2.49b.
(blender comes with an installed python, for some scripts additional installation of python 2.6.2 might be required)

It's on you to try it out
or to wait 'til someone creates a Noesis python plugin.

i did install blender 2.49b and already had python installed but had to install that version he listed and got the script to work up to the point of selecting the model to import and it wouldn't import it kept telling me to look at the log i did and told me there was a line in part the the code that errored.

Could you post the error message from the blender console window?

(Even greater it would be if you could upload the model in question.)

Alright well after going back and reinstalling everything listed i was able to get it working although some of the vehicles that start with V_come up with solid colors in the blender view port and not textured. 

Also i'd like to know how do i get the textures out when i exported to .fbx and checked it in noesis and 3ds max later it didn't have it's texture stored in the file.

One last thing i'm in the process of getting the wii the force unleashed files and those are also in the same format made by the same company who made this game but republic heroes is a year older then that game so they must of updated the format in a year, if i get the files could i possible pm you Szkaradek123 and have you take a look at them? That is unless they work once i am done extracting the files.

Hey there, i know i'm a bit late to the party, but i've been trying to make this thing work for a while now, following the indications of everyone, but i can't manage to make it work.

When i try to import a model following the instructions above, using blender 2.49b as required, i get this message in the console :

E:\Work\Starwars\Ahsoka\a_ahsoka.mkmesh.mdl

SECTION 6
Traceback <most recent call last>:
  File "Starwarstheclonewars.", line 446, in Openfile
  File "Starwarstheclonewars.", line 432, in Parser

  File "C:\program files\blender\newgamelib\mylibraries`binareslib.py", line 331, in seek
      self.inputFile.seek<off,a>
IOError: [Errno 22] Invalid Argument.

Would anyone know how to fix this problem / be able to help me with that ?
