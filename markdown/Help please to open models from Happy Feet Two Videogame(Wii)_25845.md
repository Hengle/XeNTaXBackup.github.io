- Post Title: Help please to open models from Happy Feet Two Videogame(Wii)

Hello, to all 
Last week I got the idea to extract models from this game, first i unpack the .rkv file with game character resources, but i don't know how to visualize models in programms or what plugins needed for that. In folder characters are splitted in this file formats ADS BIN AGD ADGTI MDG MDL MGV TEX and SCLFM.

So the problem is that i don't understand how open it or see the models and what programms needed. Maybe someone can help with advice or guide how do that.
I have attached a screenshot of the folder where the files of one of the characters are stored
And here's the link for zip archive with models [https://www.mediafire.com/file/qdoyu9gc ... s.zip/file](https://www.mediafire.com/file/qdoyu9gc19q1li3/HappyFeetTwoModels.zip/file)
