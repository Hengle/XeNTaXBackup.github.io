Hi guys!

So, as you can probably tell from the subject, I'm a complete and utter newbie at this whole thing, but I'm hoping to learn how to extract models and the like! Currently, I have Blender and XNALara.

My question is: is there a good "getting started" tutorial I could find to learn the basics of ripping models and importing and whatnot?

Thanks very much! I hope I've posted this in the right place and I'm not being too annoying!

You could probably start by looking at id-daemon's projects and using Ninja Ripper/3DX Ripper.

Ninjaripper will help you get rip model quick and easy. I recommend you learn hex2obj, or Modelresearcher. Hex2obj took me a few days to wrap my head around, and that's coming from a noob. Of course there are tools like Quickbms, Max, Blender, and Noesis with plenty of premade scripts. If you want to have even more control, then you need to use a bit of programming, good luck
