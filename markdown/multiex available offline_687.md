- Post Title: multiex available offline?

I've seen that the "Get update for offline use" is disabled. Perhaps the allways online policy leads to better stability, but how about the minority(?) that uses the net only at work and not at home (where it does the gaming!)?
This is more like a feature request: allow the tool to work even with no internet connection available.

It is indeed for stability and efficiency. I had this offline function in there, as you can see, but it will no longer be supported. Now, whenever there are new formats, but not a new exe, I can simply upload the formats to the server, and everyone can use them, without a download of a total new version/support file.   

If there are enough people that would like to see the offline support returned, I might consider reimplementing it. For now, that's just the way it is. Sorry.

I think we needs with "Work offline mode" in you tool.

So... Add simply option... Who needs work online and receive updates just check this option to work online, who don't have internet connection and wanna work on you tool just select to offline mode.

"Violently force people to use it online" ?????
Heh, dude must have some seriously shorted out wiring.
Either that or he's one of those whiny ACLU sissies.

That you, Rev Sharpton ?
