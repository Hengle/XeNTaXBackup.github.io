- Post Title: GS Compression (Gary Symons) -- Body Blows

Hi.

Your site is really great, but I found some compression methods which are
really unknown and which can be found "nowhere".

1.) "SQRVW" in the  header of the file.
(If you compress the file with zip or rar then the ratio is really low.
->the file with "sqrvw" must be allready compressed with unknown method)

2.) "GS Compression II Copyright Gary Symons 1993" at the end of the file.

both mentioned files types can be found in "Body Blows" ([http://www.the-underdogs.org](http://www.the-underdogs.org))

Could you try to figure out how these compression methods work?
Do you know people or "reverse engineer groups"  which are really interested
to figure out the compression methods too?
Does allready exist software to unpack the mentioned files?

Yours faithfully

I can always try. I'll do my best. But please don't pin me down on any time. I am quite busy with my job and family, besides working on MultiEx Commander, and the latter is focusing on completion on the new version before the end of july. During this time I have a truckload of formats to figure out (check out the request here!  ) so it might take some time. 
On the other hand, the advantage is, i don't have to look for new support to figure out, because there are already requests waiting.  And I just LOVE to puzzle
