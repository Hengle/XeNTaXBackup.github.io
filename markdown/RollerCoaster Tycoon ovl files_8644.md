- Post Title: RollerCoaster Tycoon ovl files?

Hey, I was wondering if anyone had information on how to go about extracting an OVL package used by roller coaster tycoon? I specifically want to get access to the models, and textures in them. Can this be done?

[http://rct3.sourceforge.net/](http://rct3.sourceforge.net/)

It seems like that is a tool that creates OVL packages from models, so it shouldn't be overly difficult to reverse the process should it?

Samples?

Having an import script means very little if there's nothing to test on.

I'm surprised they didn't release any source.
I thought you could only host open-source projects on SF?

I found the actual file spec for this game here if anyone was interested. [http://wiki.xentax.com/index.php/RollerCoaster_Tycoon_3](http://wiki.xentax.com/index.php/RollerCoaster_Tycoon_3)

I was assuming (incorrectly) that this format was the same format used by the game I'm actually trying to reverse as they are made by the same company (Kinect Disneyland Adventures). I've started a thread here for that game [viewtopic.php?f=10&t=8653](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=8653) in the game archive forum as I figured it's actually an archive. 

Thanks!
