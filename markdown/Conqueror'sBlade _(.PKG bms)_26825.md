- Post Title: Conqueror'sBlade _(.PKG bms)

Conqueror's Blade is a real-time strategy and role-playing game created using the CHAOS engine. The models inside are very beautiful, but I don't have BMS scripts to extract them. I hope someone can help me.
Can you please make a bms script for this game.

A sample file is below.

I really like this game model. I have been searching around and no one mentioned it. I really hope some one would help with exteacting model and texture.

Why would you do that? It's a different game engine as you said.

created using the CHAOS engine.
The sample file you uploaded contains only raw lz4-compressed chunks and there's no meta data in there so you're definitely missing the index files.

Usually you should check if there're any files with the same names as the pkgs.

I checked the file with the same name according to your instructions, but unfortunately I didn't find anything. I packaged the game files and a small portion of the PKG files. If possible, could you please help me take a look? Thank you

You wouldn't expect me to download a whole 1.8 giga bytes of data just to look for things for you? Sorry but that should be a job of your own. It might be easier for others to give a hint if you just upload an overall hierarchy of the directories.

Sorry, it was my mistake. As the PKG file is large, I guess it's a model file. I don't have any idea about the index file you mentioned

The pkgs are archives, containing raw compressed data of all kind of assets, including models, textures, and anything that might be used by the game. There must be some kind of index files recording the assets names, offsets, compressed sizes, decompressed sizes etc. Without those reference, it's impossible to unpack anything from those archives.

That's really difficult because I don't know anything about this, so I can only hope that someone can help me check the index files
Is there any way I can find the index

My recommendation would be reading the wiki to gain some basic understanding:
[http://wiki.xentax.com/index.php/DGTEFF ... y_Archives](http://wiki.xentax.com/index.php/DGTEFF#External_Directory_Archives)
You'll need a hex editor to examine the data of course. Shouldn't be hard if assets are stored with names.

This is a BMS I found, which is also used to unpack Conqueror's Blade, but there are additional files. Can you rely on this BMS to take a look
