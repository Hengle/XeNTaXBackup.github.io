- Post Title: THQ Wii Model Extract

Hey all - I'm trying to extract some models from a THQ game and having trouble identifying the files. 
This is the file structure in the ISO:



Can anyone tell me about the fev, fsb or rev files as far as where the models might be located and how to extract?

 Based on some file names is seems the models might be packed in the rev files but I cant find any info on them - which might be I'm assuming wrong. Not sure but thought I read that fsb have audio.

Right - the game is Puss n Boots :



 Any info appreciated.. thanx!

The .fsb files are FMOD Sample Banks and contain raw sound data. I guess the models are stored somewhere else.
