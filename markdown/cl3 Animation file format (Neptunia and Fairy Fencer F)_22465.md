- Post Title: cl3 Animation file format (Neptunia and Fairy Fencer F)

Hi, I am interested in extracting character animations and import him to 3DS max from Neptunia Rebirth 1-3, Megadimension VII, Superdimension Neptune vs Sega Hard girls and Fairy Fencer F Advent Dark Force. This animation file in cl3 format (or an archive containing them). I want to use their motions to make SFM animations. I would like to write a animation import script. but I cannot do it.
The only game in this series where I can get motions is Cyberdimension Neptunia: 4 Goddesses Online, because this game made on the Unreal engine and has a standard animation format that can be easily imported into 3D programs (3ds Max and Blender). But this game has some character animations that are different from the main games, and it lacks other characters.
