Sorry, this is impossible. Call of Duty Ghosts text files stored in FastFiles and encrypted. I tired the edit texts, but impossible. Some tools opens the FastFiles, if greater than its original size, game shuts down. I have screen shot from extracted FastFile.

I talked with them. They made it a tool. You can open, but if greater than its original size, game shuts down. You can't pass the original size. I can give you a tool from PM.
