- Post Title: Dark Souls 3 modifying fsb sound files

I want to edit sound files in DS3. This is accomplished by editing the exe to load files outside the archive. No problems with that but now I have a problem with recreating  fsb files with custom audio so I can load it into the game.

I've tried using fsbext to rebuild a fsb file called fdp_main.fsb which I extracted from Data1.bdt using bindertool. I get an error saying "The file contains unexpected data, or is smaller than expected". I've tried using wavs and raw ogg files, neither works.

I found fairly recent mod [http://www.nexusmods.com/darksouls/mods/1193/?](http://www.nexusmods.com/darksouls/mods/1193/?) for dark souls called Dark Souls Sound Inserter which works for FSB files but doesn't have support for DS3. It does use FSBext and seems output a working FSB. Though the file formats are different for DS3's FSB which uses oggs instead of MP3s for DS1 and the FSBs for DS3 seem to be encrypted since when inspecting DS1 FSBs you can see the names for the files with a hex editor and with DS3 FSBs you cant. So it seems like contacting him would be the best option for getting sound mods in DS3.

Any input would be appreciated, thanks.
