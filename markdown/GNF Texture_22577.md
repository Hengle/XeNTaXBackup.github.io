- Post Title: GNF Texture

Hi, folks. I've got a texture in a GNF format. It's highly similar to the one that is supported by Noesis (by default), but it seems to me that it's a modified version of the format, since the existing tools refuse to convert the texture. Here's a sample, I really hope something could be done about it.

Might also provide more samples, if needed. The one in the post has no alpha channel.
