- Post Title: Trouble ripping models from an XBLA title called "Raskulls"

I'm a complete no0b to model ripping. We all were at one point. Since I'm a beginner, I am having trouble ripping the models from this XBLA game that I love called Raskulls, and I'd like to rip the "Dragon" character from that game. All of my attempts were unsuccessful though. I tried using XNALara to import the .mesh file into Blender, which only resulted in errors, and tried using RenderDoc to try and capture the model through Xenia. Because I had no clue what I was doing, I gave up after a half hour of messing around. I didn't feel like paying for Ninja Ripper so I didn't try that, and the free Ninja Ripper only supports DX11 so I didn't try that either. I know there's a talented ripping community in this forum, so at the very least, could someone help me get this model ripped and put into Blender or just rip it all on their own? Any help would be greatly appreciated!

The .mesh files are only around 100KB, which gives me doubts if these models are even rippable...

Here's the same old question: what were you expecting from your so-called community without uploading any samples?

Samples you say... like the .mesh files I described in my post?

We are waiting for the .mesh files.

Alright, sorry for the wait, but here's the file. Ripped straight from the game using WXPIRS 1.1.
