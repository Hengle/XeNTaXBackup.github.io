- Post Title: Petz Sports Dog Playground - PC - where are the texts?

Hello!
I would like to translate this game, but i can't find the texts for it. Is there anybody who can help? There is a localization folder, with some 1kb example files and nothing else. I can't find any big archive files, just a lot of small, meaningless files everywhere.
