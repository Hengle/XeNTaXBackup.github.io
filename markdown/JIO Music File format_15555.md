It has some kind of encoding and only the JIO Music app from the play store can play it.Is there someone who can decode it?

The top online streaming app [Reliance Jio Music app](https://jio4gvoiceapk.in/jio-music-app-download/) will support all kinds of file format. But most of them in the library collection are MP3 format since that file format will serve better quality in sound system. Almost all songs are in high definition and most are 320kbps,192kbps etc. Need to have one Jio SIM with a valid tarrif plan offer activated. Also can enjoy free Jio caller tune with Jio music app.
