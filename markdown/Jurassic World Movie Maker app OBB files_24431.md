- Post Title: Jurassic World Movie Maker app OBB files

Hi there! new user here, I'm wanting some help with unpacking the files of a specific app to access the 3D models.
The app in question being this one: [https://apkpure.com/jurassic-world-movi ... moviemaker](https://apkpure.com/jurassic-world-moviemaker/com.nbcuni.jurassicworldmoviemaker)
The problem being the only files located are OBB. I've tried renaming them to zip to extract them but it says the file is either in an unknown format or is damaged, I've asked around on other forums and they've said to use a hex editor to find the file format to unpack them. The only problem being I have no idea how to use any sort of code-editors, if anyone here could unpack the OBB files to figure out what format the models are in that would be amazing!

UPDATE: After doing some digging using QuickBMS I found out the OBB file type is actually: EFS1. I don't know if there's script I can use to open it or not but I think I'm making progress hopefully
