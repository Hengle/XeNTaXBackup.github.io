- Post Title: Mechassault 2 XBOX - GR2 files (Granny Animation)

Hey, everyone! I was looking through the decompressed files of Mechassault 2 and stumbled upon .GR2 files which are used for animation. I dealt with these long ago, when ripping content from Oddworld: Stranger's Wrath. I tried using the same technique but was unsuccessful... If anyone be able to help with this conundrum, I'd be really thankful.. I'm trying to port animated Mechassault Models to Gmod for people to use and maybe even make vehicles and SNPC's out of them!

[Here](https://mega.nz/#!hQQGjarJ!Hi2DKifH93gDjtZwlj_8oSe-I_opLfvLEZeyQlSwu8s) are some sample files ( https://mega.nz/#!hQQGjarJ!Hi2DKifH93gD ... ZeyQlSwu8s )

[Here](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=17962) is the Mechassault thread that helped me decompress and extract the level files  ( viewtopic.php?f=16&t=17962 )

[Here](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=14412)is the Oddworld: Stranger's Wrath thread that helped ripped models and animations (also .gr2)   ( viewtopic.php?f=16&t=14412 )

Thanks for reading!
