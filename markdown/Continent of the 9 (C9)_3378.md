Yet another game to chop up 

The very very very beautful games C9 actually has decrypted PKZIP files named .cfs

I can open in PKZIP but then it asks for password. Model archive has files called .r3cb, .r3cm and r3ce and of course .dds files

The fx.cfs is the smallest one so i attach it here if someone wants to look at it.

Here are some tasty screens:

the main executable could be useful too although I bet it's encrypt as usual and consequently useless (but I will not download various gigabytes of a mmorpg).

anyway two notes:
- the correct name of the game is "Continent of the Ninth"
- was good to put also a link to the official homepage of the game or its download page (I think it's for koreans only because here doesn't work): [http://c9.hangame.com/pds/download.nhn](http://c9.hangame.com/pds/download.nhn)

Sorry about that. I registered for CB but don't think I got in but I am able to login and downloaded client.

I found this really really cool page aboput plaintext cracking pkzip files. Read it, I almost understood everything  But the problem is I have vista 64bit and can't run pkcrack files

We are lucky I think. With the above mentioned method we need an original file that is inside one of the archive. Guess what. The speedtree.cfs archive includes speedtree textures that can be found in other games and demos. I am right now trying to find matching textures so we actually have a plaintext file 

[http://www.2shared.com/file/4997331/360 ... tures.html](http://www.2shared.com/file/4997331/3603cd38/textures.html)

I found one texture-set that matches at least in name. It's queenbark texture and you can find the same in this demo:

[http://www.speedtree.com/downloads/trees_of_pangaea.htm](http://www.speedtree.com/downloads/trees_of_pangaea.htm)

In the VIETNAMESE JUNGLE.

I donwloaded some of the others and compared but could not find any with same name.

The textures from the jungle demo and from the archive in c9 seem to have a couple of kb difference in size.

I tried the above method but got a error in the end that i probably have wrong plaintext. Maybe you guys can try it

I will try to host it on filefront in 2 sections.
I am currently downloading the client. i will post more when I can.

This link work to me yesterday, I hit to install and said that file was corrupted, Today I try to download again and the file its not there anymore...

Can anyone tell me how to register to the C9 website? 

I try , when I hit sign up> then a Active X thing comes out then I hit install and then nothing...

So is there really a way to register to this site and to download the whole game and even to install it? 

Well I think its unknown....


Unless someone prove me wrong....

Which I know no one will

Thanks

first of all, a general rule when it comes to korean games, you must use Internet explorer. Install the active x because it is a webinstall.

I don't know if you need to register but if you do you have to have a kssn, a korean social number and there are methos of getting those 

You can't play it because it is closed beta and they have chosen the ones to play

So we cannot Play until the servers are open again? Ok! I know I need KSSN, I know how to find it, and the name too.

it is so weird, why the setupC9.exe that I download yesterday took of size 1.53GB, and today when  I try  to download for the third time, took only 68MB?

This is so weird, do you know why?

Well it doesn't matter at last the file its not corrupted and it can be installed without problem, except that its in Korean lol   

But this game its Offline too?

  Too bad, we can't play until the servers are open then...

you can't play right now. It is very very impossible if you do not know someone who actually got into the closed beta.

The reason this thread got started is like all other threads here, to look at the archives and extract info

oohh,       Sorry for being so ignorant... 

I totally doubt someone knew someone that did enter to the Beta...
Unless you are Korean or did register, Download and install successfully the game to play it.    

So, what can I do with the game already installed? Look over it and decrypt files with the PKcrack? I did us this, its cool how this thing can break into encrypted files, but how this tool will help us do some progress with this C9...   

Although I will keep in touch to see what  I can do to help and see what you guys has done...

Ok, C9 has now entered a open beta face and can be downloaded and played. I have made some progress I think but I really need some help. THis is what I did:

When the launcher was downloading a patch I grabbed it as soon as it was 100%, it was still deflating some archives so I had some time to grab it.

The patch file is .zip containing c9.exe and movies and more. The archive was "broken" so I ran it through PKZIP because it was stated in hex that it was PK. It tried to "fix the zip" and did so. I am now able to open the zip file in winrar etc. The patch.zip is password protected but does include c9.exe and some movies, these are already in the install folder so I was thinking a plain-text attack on the archive would do the trick.

But, when plain-text attacking you need to zip down the c9.exe so it matches EXACT the c9.exe in the patch.zip and this is where I am lost, here is a comparison of the patch.zip and my zip file:



Any ideas of what to do next?

The password may change from version to version and that is why you can not extract the archive from this first post.
Here are some sample archives you can try without downloading the whole client.
[http://www.MegaShare.com/1333973](http://www.MegaShare.com/1333973) (20mb)
[http://www.MegaShare.com/1333975](http://www.MegaShare.com/1333975) (6mb)
rename any cfs file to zip then use winrar to repair it.
then you can extract with the password.
If winrar won't see the files use this free tool

with 7zip you can basically right-click any file and choose extract  If it doesn't extract it ain't a zip file 

Thanks for posting this, extremly cool!

I just have no idea how to get a password that is not plaintext

I've looked the difference between the original and the repair version of file. In fact it's just the end of file, the tree structure of files, which differ because i think they used a korean software to zip.

So to make a correct archive copy the end of the orginal (where the tree structure begins) into the new one.

But I'm wondering if gameguard is able to detect the modification of a file and believe it's cheat ?

How do you get the file back in the game ?

I've looked into the binary data of csf file and it appears that for some files this info are deleted from the header :

crc32
compressed size
uncompressed size

And at the end of the file (Central directory structure) the external attributes of each file are 0x81B40002.

I think it will be easy to do this mod with a small software, but how do you set the "End of central directory record". 

Ps : It's the first time i tried to look into the res of a software so i have any knowledge and i suppose there is a better way to convert the zip file into a csf one.

EDIT : So i have done the software you can find the src below (in c#), now i have one probleme with characteername.filter i dont know why the data is the same the offset where the header is in the zip is correct. But when the game launch i get this error :



I got this error when i have changed some data, if i change any data but i use my software c9 run fine.

So if you have any idea it will be great.

Thanks

- Post Title: Re: Continent of the 9 (C9)

Ok it's worked i've figured out what changed between the zip and the cfs.

At the end of the file (header 0x06054B50), the cfs one have a particulary description :

4 bytes : 0X54235423 , the same for all cfs files
8 bytes : 0x5DA85DA800037ED0 , each cfs file have his one value (this is the value of GameData.cfs)
4 bytes : this value is the most important it's a "crypted" value of start offset of the tree structure definition
2 bytes : 0x5423 , the same for all cfs files

To set the correct start offset you can use the original file and add (or remove) the diff of length.

What i have said before is now obsolete, you just have to change the end of the zip file to make it working.

You can find here the C# source code to convert a zip to csf (you will need the originial csf file)

```
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Text;
using System.IO;

namespace ZipToCSF
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {

            Int32 offsetStart;


            FileStream zipFile = File.Open("GameData.zip", FileMode.Open);
            FileStream csfFile = File.Open("GameData.new.cfs", FileMode.Create);
            FileStream csfOrig = File.Open("GameData.cfs", FileMode.Open);

            

            BinaryReader zipReader = new BinaryReader(zipFile);
            BinaryWriter csfWriter = new BinaryWriter(csfFile);
            BinaryReader csfReader = new BinaryReader(csfOrig);

            while (zipReader.BaseStream.Position < (zipReader.BaseStream.Length - 18))
            {
                csfWriter.Write(zipReader.ReadBytes(1));
            }

            csfReader.BaseStream.Seek(-14, SeekOrigin.End);

            csfWriter.Write(0x54235423);

            csfWriter.Write(csfReader.ReadBytes(8));

            offsetStart = csfReader.ReadInt32();

            offsetStart += (int)(zipReader.BaseStream.Length - csfReader.BaseStream.Length);

            csfWriter.Write(offsetStart);


            csfWriter.Write((byte)0x23);
            csfWriter.Write((byte)0x54);

            csfWriter.Close();
            csfReader.Close();
            zipReader.Close();

            System.Console.WriteLine("Enter to finish...");
            System.Console.ReadLine();
        }
    }
}

Yep i'm working on a french version (that's why my english is so bad  ), but we are only 2 so if you have a more active community and you need some help dont be afraid to contact me i will be pleased to help you (of course not on the traduction but on the archive file)

Nice however i have question for the charset, we are french and we use some special char like é è à etc ... Is the korean charset gonna be a problem for this char ? I have seen in a file the language definition and i'm wondering if the charset is define somewhere in the ressource ?

EDIT : And i have seen in the root directory of the game, file C9Patch.cfg is also a zip and you can set the url for the patch. So if you want to be very pro it will be funny to make our own patch server and distribute the translation by mod this file.

Yes it should be very interesting if we make our own patch server they are using apatche web server so it should be very possible.
What happens when you try to display the characters in game?
I think if you have the font installed that you put in the xml files you should be ok.

How to decode files .c9u and .c9d? In .c9u stored text of interface. In first half of .c9d stored sounds and effects of skills, and the second part of file stored game text: messages, tooltip.

Now working of the C9U file:

I'm sure this file are definition of panel, here is the description of what i've believe in order to use this file 

First 4 bytes the header type of file : 0x3CF5C28F
4 bytes : ???? (usually equal to 0x00000000)
4 bytes : Length of the panel Name
panelNameLength bytes : Panel Name
24 bytes : Attributes of the panel
[Composants of Panel]
4 bytes : Header for the composant (type ?) 
24 bytes : Attributes of the Composant
4 bytes   : Size of the texture file name us
textureSizeName bytes : Name of the texture file

Other attributes of the composant 

If some people are more advanced it will be nice to extract this info to translate the text of some composant.

There is a way to get the text from the c9u files :

Search the BaseFont String
After this you have a 4 bytes wich egal the size of the text you want to get
After you get the text

Be careful the text is encode with UTF-16 charset so the real length of text in the file is the size * 2

The program UltraEdit Can edit the text without much trouble after you set the font to Hangul.
There are some very small files of the same type we could study .c9d files in the ui folder.
I noticed a lot of English text already in the files.

Well its a start I will correct the few problems show here but you get the idea


Here they are corrected

Gamedata\Msg\GameConsent.dat is 100% translated 
ill upload another file once I get some more translated.

For the C9u file i have make a prog here is the link : 

[http://bde-paupup.com/temp/c9Quest/c9uDecodeEncode.exe](http://bde-paupup.com/temp/c9Quest/c9uDecodeEncode.exe)

This prog need 2 args,

This first 0 or 1, 0 decode the file, 1 encode the file
The second argument is the filename 

When you decode the file you need the original c9u file
When you encode the file you need the orginal c9u file and the file of translation

For example :

c9uDecodeEncode.exe 0 ui_systemmenu

This wiil create a ui_systemmenu_translate_file.txt file which contains all the text from the c9u file (for good reading of this file use firefox and set the charse to UTF-8)
After this translate the contenu and put the translation in the same order as the ui_systemmenu_translate_file.txt and save the content as ui_systemmenu_line_file.txt

Launch this command :

c9uDecodeEncode.exe 1 ui_systemmenu

This will create a ui_systemmenu.new.c9u file

Remplace the old file by this new one
Create the zip
Convert to cfs and here it is :

I would ask a question what's the parameter did you use to create the zip file ? Right now i'm changing the file direcly in zip via WinRar but it's long when you haved to change a binary file so i would extract the archive and built-t after but it's not working so i believe the are special options to set.

Sorry for the double post but the best way to do on screen recognition it's to get the gameengine dll and modifiy how the chat is working by using a translation webservice (i believe google have one) But to do that i need more time and i can't actually.

you need to tell me more.
what max version os language. the best bet is to copy the script into a new document and then try.
its most likely a Unicode problem.

I know this is a necro. But the game is in global cb right now. And the bms script from chrrox works to extract the files from the csf.

I want to know how to read the c9u anf such so I can mod the ui. Also how to import them back would be awesome as well.

Chrrox bone script doesn't seem to work with current files.

On trying to load pm0000.r3cb I get error:
--unknown property: "count" in undefined
on line with code: fseek f (0x107	- bonename.count)#seek_cur

Bone file that Chrrox uploaded (shaman skeleton pm0000.r3cb) works fine with the script, but current one pm0000.r3cb doesn't.
I compared both files and new one is larger.

With old bone file on trying to load hair file: pm0003_hair.r3cm
On line with code: maxbone = getnodebyname BNArr[boneidtablearray].name I got this error
-- Runtime error: array index must be positive number, got: -66

I get similar errors on trying to load head/hair/eyes files with old bone file that Chrrox posted here, so can only use that bone file only for importing chest, gloves, legs and foot parts of body.
Also if I want to play with WitchBlade/Hunter/Fighter files I can't use that Shaman Skeleton File.

Chrrox can u update the scripts. Game is currently released in US/EU.

- Post Title: Re: Continent of the 9 (C9)

I am trying to parse through the ENG_GameData.c9t found in the GameData/Msg/ENG/ENG.cfs.
Basically it stores several, if not all, item names aswell as other strings.

It is actually really simple there is no compression, no encryption, nothing.
But I just cannot figure some things out, about how they're stored in that file.

Basically the format is like this:
Square brackets indicate optional bytes.

```

repeat until eof
   4 bytes num_strings
  [4 bytes null] (unknown, always null)

  repeat num_strings times
    4     bytes id
    4     bytes string_len
    len*2 bytes string (utf16)
    [4    bytes null] (unknown, always null)
      
    [repeat unknown times]
      [4     bytes string_len] (a following string with no id, it doesn't count to the num_strings)
      [len*2 bytes string]
      [4     bytes null] (unknown, always null)
    [endrepeat]
  endrepeat
endrepeat

```


So first thing is, I don't know how many of non-id strings follow one with an id.
I could just detect them by doing some checks, but then those unknown nulls come into play.

I just don't know what they're good for, they appear in the above mentioned format from time to time. Most of the time they're not there and then they're on every string for some time.

Here is test parse on the first category of strings:

```
NUM - ID (dec) hex   | [offset] (num non-id string)
NUM: 0	 (8)	 8	 | [8]: 	Elite Hunter (*)
NUM: 1	 (17)	11	| [730]: 	Elementalist (**)

It doesn't parse num 35 correctly because its missing one element with an id.
The reason is, that in this test parse, the 4 unknown nulls are being skipped. This results that the string after the very first "Elite Hunter" is being parsed as a non-id string (since it has those nulls before its string length). However, as a result, the string which is supposed to be num 33, is now also read as a non-id string, since its id is null. You can see that at num 32, Elite Fighter (*****), the asterisks show how many non-id strings follow. The third one is supposed to be a normal string.

Later in the file, those nulls appear after every string for a while. And I have really no idea what to do with them.

In the attachment is a 1mb cut ENG_GameData.c9t file.

I hope you guys could me out as to what the correct file format is. Thanks!

bump, has no one really ever seen a format similar to this one (ENG_GameData.c9t)? I just can't figure out when the "unknown" nulls appear.
