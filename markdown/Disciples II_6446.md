Yes, oldie. One of greatest games for PC that I ever player need graphics "retouch", but there is a problem. DragonUnpacher (with hyper ripper) can extract all png(8) files but cannot import them. MultiExtractor can extract and inject png files but when I play the game I see garbage like this:

And don't know what to do. I use "save for web" irfan View plugin for size compatibility. I tried exact colors numbers in photoshop, but with no luck. Always the same result. I don't see any pallete file. I'm lost. Totally. Can you guys help? I don't know, tool for injecting graphic files, hook some dll for png24 into .exe file or something.

Sorry for my poor English.

But capitol (static) images don't use transparency. Disciples II use pink color for units / effects / other transparency, but, like I said, you don't have any transparency in capitol images. I don't know about possibility hooking zlippng dll (with png24 support?) with Disciples II executable file (I'm know simply nothing about programming), but I think that probably can solve problem with graphics. But this is work for guy with big balls and programming skills. Anyone?

Again, sorry for broken english.
