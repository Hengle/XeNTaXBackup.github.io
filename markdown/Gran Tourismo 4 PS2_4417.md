Hello!

I tried ripping it with 3dxripper but i get flat mesh.With PCSX2 emulator.

Cars are in range of 100k - 150k Polys.

Is there an alternative i really like this game.

Thanks

Consoles always have models wich PC doesnt have.
So I agree.
Luckily the Forza 3 is being assf(...) and the OBJ filter is on the way haha
But 500?!
Then we need to copy GTA games folders about 5 or 10 times
to get all these 500 cars imported lol

But, 100-150k polies on old shit console called PlayStation2?

Oh no no no my friend.

Gran turismo has A LOT A LOT of high detailed high poly cars.

Now its up to the public if they really want it.Plus there is Gran turismo Prolouge out aswell 5 coming out.

And the great cracking gurus.



I really really doubt the day for this game.
