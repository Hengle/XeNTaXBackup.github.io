- Post Title: *.bsa extractor for TES 3,4,5 and Fallout 3

Hi guys. Today, I present to you BSA extractor. I know a lot of them, but I wanted to write his own, to study the structure of *.BSA:)

Supported games:
- TES3: Morrowind;
- TES4: Oblivion;
- TES5: Skyrim;
- Fallout 3;
- Fallout 3: New Vegas;




The program is simple, and should not cause problems of its use.

Written on Delphi:)

Tool can be found here in attachment:)

Ah, I forgot:) Sources as always you can found at git: [https://github.com/CynicRus/BSAExtractor](https://github.com/CynicRus/BSAExtractor)
