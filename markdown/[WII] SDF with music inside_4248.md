Good day everyone who searches for answer here and of course archive specialists! Let me tell you about my currently unsuccessful ripping attempt.

I want to extract a game soundtrack out of SDF files. This format seems to be unexpected because even VGMstream doesn`t know it. I tried to open them with Ground control2 (WinSDF) and World in conflict (can be found on this forum) unpackers but no result. Can anyone recommend what to do next? I uploaded [the smallest of them](http://www.megaupload.com/?d=AOL9T6A8)

Well, there`s been 7 downloads of that sample but no one actually knows how to deal with it?
