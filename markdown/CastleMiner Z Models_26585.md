Hello Everyone! I'm trying to rip 2 raw XNB models from CastleMiner Z(Which I got them luckily), I tried my best of using hex2obj and no success so, can someone else help me ripping those using hex2obj and send me a screenshot so I can do it on my own? I really need assistance on those models. here is the google drive link of 3 raw files from the game: [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LOQSsk ... 7mytl/view](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LOQSskHGq5j04okLb5UcyvuoJ2U7mytl/view) (Ignore the Skeleton raw model, I'm only aiming at ZombieHigh and SWATMale models) (Also, i'm doing this because i'm doing an addon in Garry's Mod to port CMZ models into the game and yeah, I'm a Source Engine modder)

I got something with zombieHigh, I used model researcher.

I don't know if it is correct but looks fine

They look good, I'll just modify the mesh of it's original pose, thank you very much mate, now the last model is the SWATMale and I'll probably add more models from this game. 
The next raw models are the Satan model, The Alien model and the Proxyboy model (OG xbox 360 character), I'll provide them here when I'm about to head home.

Sorry but If you want the models, you need to extract them with Model Researcher. This will help you, so try by your self, compare zombiehigh with the other files to find similarities:(check the next image)

About UVs put the same vertices offset and increase this by 4 until get something(enable polygons check box in MR).

I guess all models have the same or similar format but Padding could be different so pay attention to that too.
That is all I can do, good luck!

Alright, thanks for the tutorial, you are the best and thanks for the help, much appreciated. 
(even though I'm not a programmer, which kinda worries me a little bit because I'm a modeler and I'm doing mods for Garry's Mod   , this is why i'm here for)
Let me explain my Garry's Mod modding schedule for CastleMIner Z Playermodel Pack:
When 2 CastleMIner Z models are ripped, i'm porting them into Source as private, when the last model is the SWATMale model is ripped, I'll update the add-on, remove it and publish it publicly on the Steam Workshop, those raw files like the demon, the alien and the proxyboy, those are optional models to port them into Source Engine (If I example don't have them and i'll only port the SWATMale model, for me it's totally fine). That's my schedule and let me warn this, I have absolutely zero knowledge about programming, I know some things about Model Researcher and Hex2OBJ but I don't have further knowledge about this. I've been modding Source for 3 years using only the old version of Blender 2.79b.

By the way, this thread is not closed because I'm not a programmer, that's why I edited that post earlier if you didn't noticed.
