- Post Title: [PSX] Help finding/move "one pointer only"... in PS1 EXE

Hello everyone,

I have one small problem with my translation, everything in the game was translated correctly, because i was able to find pointers in the files, but not into the EXE (GAME.EXE)... So my problem is i need to move the word to another place to have to have 2 bytes more long to have the right translation... I need to write "CONTINUER" but i miss 2 letters long space... for now i use "ANNULER" (CANCEL) but its a garbage translation for the word CONTINUE...

If someone can help me to find the pointer and relocate it it can be perfect!!

The game is THRILL KILL (FULL UNCENSORED) [SLUS-00752] and the word is at 8F774 position...

Here is the EXE in attachment.

So if someone can help me please...
