Hi Skrillex I have had to remove the download links you posted to protect our community. The reason for this is, the website after clicking either of the two download buttons. Redirected my web browser to a malicious advertising website with forced pop-ups that wouldn't go away.

Please refrain from posting such links in the future.

You should contact with Hunositok Team. I think Konyak could help you. They made the Hungarian translation of this game.

The original text files: [https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/495 ... tax/SCC.7z](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/4953836/Xentax/SCC.7z)!
I can try to help you in the translation if I can (it was 4 years ago the last time I worked on this), but I cannot share the tools.

Look, do you need my help to put back your translation into the game or not? Make a decision!
Send me back the xml files, if the translation is done.

You're wrong i'm not rude. I mean if owner's doesn't share this tool with anyone than how did he get this tool? I'm only use this tool to translate game. Not a bank robbing.

And game is going to RIP, this tool matter for who?
