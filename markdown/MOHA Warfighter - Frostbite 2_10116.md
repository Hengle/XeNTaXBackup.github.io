Nope. The game engine is too tricky. Search leaked F2 Engine Source Code

FB2 source code leaked? And BF3/MH modding is still non-existant?
Do I live under a rock or what?

Just tried it on Origin Games\Medal of Honor Warfighter\Data\Win32\Loc\en.sb

I got over 5300 files, only 22 are over 900kb. None have file extensions.

there are no references on google regarding a leaked "source code" of the Frostbite engine/bf3.
pdb are useful but they don't contain the full source code.

and oh well about [viewtopic.php?p=82935#p82935](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?p=82935#p82935) this is 100% fake :)

anyway that thing of the pdb was probably interesting to have more info about the network protocol, it's bad that there are no links working.
