- Post Title: Resident evil reveltaion PS4 (CUSA06212)

Greetings I managed to get a resident evil revelations PS4.
I was hoping it would contain higher resolution textures than the 2013 PC release.

But after unpacking the DVD, the textures are identical 1K compared to PC, Am I missing something ?
