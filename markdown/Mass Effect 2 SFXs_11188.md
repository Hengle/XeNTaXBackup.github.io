I am trying to get Mass Effect 2 Sfxs. Kyp's extractor, however, misses most of them from the CPP archives. any suggestion?

I'm wondering the same thing, I'm having a lot of trouble extracting the .pcc from ME2 more specifically the weapon sounds. The only thing I know does work is if your using kyp's extractor is before it finishes scanning, close the program before it deletes the temp folder it has created, 9 out of 10 times you'll see it successfully extracts the sounds albeit you have to use audacity in order to listen to them. 

I would really like to know if there is an easier way to extract all the sounds .pcc included.

If your using Windows 7 another thing that helps is when you start the program to extract the sounds, you get a security prompt for ww2gg.exe to run. If you don't do anything and you check the folder for the sounds you'll find them in there and they'll play if you put them in audacity. 

it's worth mentioning still won't extract everything, I'm still having problems extracting weapon sounds from the .pcc archives.

Still am curious to know if there is an easier way though...

Sorry dude, I don't upload sounds, not out of spite, or being an ass, it's just something I don't do for personal reasons. Like I said it is a hit or miss that you'll actually get it to work. 

Also if Kyp reads this, do you know where all the weapon sounds are stored? Because I can't seem to find them anywhere.

well, considering you won't upload them, can you at least make a small video?

I also tried extracting the files within PCC archives via the UDK unpacker, but it can find no sfx.

on a secondary note, is there ANY way to get Mass Effect 2 music out of its AFC archives AND keeping the loop point information?

If there's, guys at me3explorer forums will have probably figured out that

I'm not sure if all this has been backported to me2 explorer, though everything is widely documented, so it shouldn't be difficult even in this case
