- Post Title: OpenGL model and texture ripper

I did a bit of googling but I couldn't find a single OpenGL ripper that works. I either stumbled upon dead links or non-working software.

Is there something like NinjaRipper or 3D RipperXD but for OpenGL based games? If it had 64bit support, that would be best.

Try OpenGLXtractor.
