- Post Title: Breakdown .pak support

Can there please be some Breakdown *.pak support?

Through working with the Xbox game "Breakdown" for a while, I've found that the .pak files that are littered throughout the game directories have the proper .pak header (BDPK), but are unrecognized as .pak formats. Maybe Namco came up with a proprietary .pak format?

One .pak I'm particularly interested in is called "gallery.pak", and I'm assuming it somehow has a connection with 20 other files in the same directory, named "gallery.000", "gallery.001", "gallery.002", etc. These files seem to be TIM2 formatted images, but cannot be opened with typical TIM2 image viewers. They are probably compressed under gallery.pak.

Here is a 500KB cut version of gallery.pak, and the entire gallery.000 as an example.
