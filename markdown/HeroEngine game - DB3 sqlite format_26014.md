- Post Title: HeroEngine game - DB3 sqlite format

Hello, XenTax family, how are u?
It's been a long time, it's a great feeling to be back again.Here I have a game, it is a game produced in 2015 with Hero Engine 2, and the full game file is available. The patch file of the game is a special (.tor) file like SWTOR and is hidden with the SQLite3 data system. This time the file extension is divided into two parts, .db3 and db3.status.

I need to open these files, but I don't have enough experience how to do it. I would be very happy if you could help me with this.Here I leave a part of the files below.

Since all the files are about 18GB, I can't upload them all here, but if I can find the file in the example, I can truly be the happiest person in 2023.

I tried a lot to open it with a tool like EasyMYP, SQLite DB Browser etc but I didn't have enough information and didn't have much success. Because the pack structure of the SWTOR game has a .tor file that works with SQLite 3 format. That's why I think people who know can handle it.

With the SQLite DB Browser I can see some of its contents, but it contains full data. I need to extract this data.
Here is an old example of the data stored in it.

SQLite DB Browser previews image type data only. For this reason, it is displayed as .binary even though it is in a lot of data.
