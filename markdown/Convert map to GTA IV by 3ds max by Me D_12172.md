My friend, thank you for you help, I downloaded the new script and have removed all the old versions, reinstall the script
Installation:
1) Delete all previous GIMS IV versions
2) Delete "<3Ds MAX path>\scripts\startup\GIMS_IV.mse"
3) Delete all files in:
Windows Vista/7/8: "<DRIVE>:\Users\<USER_NAME>\AppData\Roaming\GIMS_IV\modules\"
Windows 2K/XP: "<DRIVE>:\Documents and Settings\<USER_NAME>\Application Data\GIMS_IV\modules\"
4) Extract "GIMS_IV" folder into:
Windows Vista/7/8: "<DRIVE>:\Users\<USER_NAME>\AppData\Roaming\"
Windows 2K/XP: "<DRIVE>:\Documents and Settings\<USER_NAME>\Application Data\"
5) Extract "scripts" folder into the 3D MAX 9 SP1 (or newer version) directory
But still display the above error
