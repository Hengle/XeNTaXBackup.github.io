Anyone know if there is a good PN03 Vanessa 3D model rip from the game?  So that we can view the model outside the game in another 3D viewer [such as 3ds Max, Maya, etc.]?

There is a mod with Vanessa for Resident Evil 4, I think that on the RE4/5 PC Forums. Have a Google.

It's the model from the original game, with all the suit variations.

I don't know if you're interested in this but..

What you will need to get this model if you can't find the RE4 model:

The Gamecube P.N.03 .iso (of Course)
GC Tool Written by Icarus/Paradox
PN03 Extractor Tools by /dev/ghostline
3DS Max Application to View with (but of course)

#1. Open Gamecube .iso with GC Tool v1.2 written by Icarus/Paradox.
#2. Extract all contents to a folder.
#3. Extract the contents of the em folder with emdscan.exe
#4. Convert these new files into .obj with obdumper.exe
#5. Extract .tpl files into textures using txdumper.exe
#6. Import .obj into Max and apply textures.

I've done this awhile back but don't have the model or .iso anymore.
I can gather the tools if you're interested in performing this task.

If anybody finds misinformation in this post please let me know and I'll correct promptly.

Sorry don't have the model.
