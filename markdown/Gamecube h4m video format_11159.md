Nope, no one ever solved that format, or at least the video part of it. I think the company that created the format hadn't paid the fees for years, so that created an obstacle for anyone who would want to work on the format.. or something like that. Or it made it impossible for anyone to obtain SDK to work on format..? Don't know, but that's what I remember from years ago while researching about this issue. 

Sure would be nice to have it figured out though 

In regard to Resident Evil games, at least there's a work around solution, REmake and RE0 came out on Wii and that was using THP foramt for videos, which has tools out there to demux or convert it.

thpplay 1.5 can play THP videos, SUPER video converter can convert to other formats or split THP file into individual JPG images (btw THP is essentially a collection of JPG images, kinda like BIK), and VGMtoolbox can demux.
