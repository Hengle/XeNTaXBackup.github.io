- Post Title: XeNTaX forum to stop by end of 2023

As a heads-up, the XeNTaX Game Research Forum is currently scheduled to go offline indefinitely by end of this year. 

We haven't found a suitable buyer to hand it over to that would be able to expand and build the site into something that it deserves. 
Of course, if someone has an idea to get this still in place, via GoFundMe or whatever, we might be able to discuss a solution in terms of buying the site from us. But that needs to be driven by someone respected by our community, with commitment to make it work. 

Another alternative is for someone to start a new site somewhere, that will be able to tailor to the same niche community. 

Don't forget to join the Discord: [https://discord.gg/jjcpY75XJx](https://discord.gg/jjcpY75XJx) to keep in touch with part of the community after the site goes black. 

It has been a great past 20 years, and I appreciate that a lot of wonderful people still go here regularly to learn, get information and to demystify file formats, but there will be other options, I am sure.
