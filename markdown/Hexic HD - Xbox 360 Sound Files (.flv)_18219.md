Hello everybody! Today I come asking how does one convert those catchy and sexy sounds from the classic Xbox 360 puzzle game, Hexic HD. I managed to extract them up until now, where I can't figure out how to convert them to .wav or any other manageable format.
Here is a link with the files. Looking forward to an answer! Thanks for your attention!

[Hexic HD Sounds](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/auhbcadiqnct2m3/AAChMpFHFO9IV5Fg9_MrN3sCa?dl=0)

Here you go 

Transcoded into PCM WAV from XMA using vgmstream.

I have also included the original XMA streams just in case anyone else wants them.

Any chance either of you still have the WAV files handy? The Dropbox link is dead. Thanks!
