- Post Title: Ripping models from Avakin Life (android mobile game)

So yeah as the title says I need help ripping models from Avakin life.
I found out the game is Unity and usually that would be a piece of cake, however, the models don't seem to be stored in the data.
Is it possible they are stored online and loaded whenever in use?
There are only some files that I was able to open in Unity Asset Studio which is some rooms from the game but what i'm looking for is the characters, clothes, hair and animations

Any help would be really appreciated as i've been trying several things for almost a week now and found nothing online about it.

root your phone and look for the games data directory using a root explorer tool.
the unity files should be stored there as you see them in game they will cache to your phone.

I've checked those file and they do not have hair,clothes or the characters. My phone is not rooted but I was still able to get to the directory and files using ES file explorer manager.

The thing is, root always fails for me.
I haven't unlocked bootloader cuz the webpage thing for Huawei isn't there and idk how so

Can I do it without root somehow?

Just use nox with ninja ripper in direct x mode to get the costume you want.

The files are not unity and models look really low quality.
the files are xored with a 4 byte key but that is as far as i am taking this.
just use ninja ripper.

nox works fine just set it to direct x mode.
then go into the cash shop on a new account and rip any file you want with ninja ripper.

I have no idea how you even got something like this but I highly appreciate the time and effort!! 

Really? The characters are not unity? but the game is unity lol that's strange.
I would use Ninja ripper but Ninja ripper doesn't do animations or skeleton which is why I wanted the actual files.

How did you even get these webp files? I'm interested

Hey I am trying to learn how to extract models from games, specifically Avakin Life. Is there anyway you can record the steps of how you extracted the model successfully?
