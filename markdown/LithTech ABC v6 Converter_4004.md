- Post Title: LithTech ABC v6 Converter?

I'm currently looking for a way to convert Blood 2's models into something more easily usable, preferably MD3 files (the specific end result I'm looking to have).  The problem is that the only two existing methods I've found for converting this specific type of ABC model are the official [Blood 2 Tools](http://www.moddb.com/games/blood-2-the-chosen/downloads/blood-2-modding-tools) which include a command line program called ABC23DS which converts the model into a faulty 3DS (displays on import into Milkshape as a cube with trashed geometry inside of it) and an ancient, broken [Milkshape plugin](http://3dfxdev.net/msabcimporter.zip) from 2001 that apparently only works in version 1.5.3 or earlier (and even then with a massive amount of bugs) which is impossible to find online.  I've got no idea where to go from here, however, I figure that somebody here might be able to come up with a solution.  It shouldn't be too hard for somebody who knows what they're doing since there's documentation on the [LithTech ABC v6 file format](http://www.bop-mod.com/download/docs/LithTech-ABC-v6-File-Format.html).

Hopefully somebody can help me out.  I'm at wit's end!

Hello,

I added  the .abc loader module to the 3D Object Converter developer version, but I need to test it with other sample files.

If you send me ( [kz_3d@tvn.hu](mailto:kz_3d@tvn.hu) ) some .zip packed .abc sample files (+ its texture files) I will convert these files to .obj/mtl formats and I will send back to you the converted files to check out the results.
