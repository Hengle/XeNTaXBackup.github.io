I want to see if there are any text/subtitle file/s in english there liek there was in the first Deponia game.
Can someone create two scripts in bms to extract Chaos On Deponia German and a script to merge back the file ?

Thanks.

EDIT:

Chaos ON Deponia is the new game its Deponia 2 ! Its not Deponia.

Are you sure you are talking about Chaos On Deponia the second game  ? And not Deponia the first game ?
Im looking on the list of the supported games in the website of XpoZeD's and cant find any Chaos On Deponia im looking here:

[http://www.nullsecurity.org/unpakke](http://www.nullsecurity.org/unpakke)

I tried to unpack now data.vis with the file upkk_vis3.dll but i see now that on any file he try to unpack from data.vis a message:

Unkwon type: ....
