- Post Title: Hay Day (iOS) binary file

I made another thread here about the compressed file format: [viewtopic.php?f=21&t=10522](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=21&t=10522)
I managed to add 4 0x00 bytes after the LZMA header and then extract the file using 7zip, after doing so I got a binary file which contains human readable string names if you open the file with notepad.

Unfortunatly I have no idea how to extract the source images from this binary file, I assume it contains embedded png files with an animation list. I am uploading the file hoping for some expert to have a look at this.
