- Post Title: Epic Mickey .wav files

Hi. Me and many others in the Epic Mickey community have been trying for ages to compress (if that is the right word?) sound files so we can make mods for the game. We've managed to use a program, vgstream, to put them in a readable format, but not vise versa. The format seems to be Audiokinetic Wwise RIFF (though a hex editor says RIFX), and use Nintendo DSP 4-bit ADPCM encoding. While they are called .wav files, they are not in traditional wave format, and wont open on a normal media player. We already know how to "extract" them, but we want to compress them. Any help would be appreciated. Thanks!
