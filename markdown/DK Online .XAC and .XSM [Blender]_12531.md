Hello there! I'm just wondering if anyone has a working blender script for DK Online meshes [.xac] and animations [.xsm]?
Here is a sample file: [https://mega.co.nz/#!1sVlmAyT!e5tVgYe71 ... LkCkhLCLLM](https://mega.co.nz/#!1sVlmAyT!e5tVgYe71XcqS51eJcpwMNlXYY_WoxSt3LkCkhLCLLM)

there's a Noesis python script from finale00: fmt_DKOnline_xac.py which can display the mesh.

(no anim support iirc)

@Keezie 
I don't have this game. If is something wrong with models, animations or textures please send more samples.
Here is importer for models and animations.
It requires Blender249 and Python 26
In Blender Text Window press alt+p and select:
-xac file - skinned meshes
-xsm file - animation

@shakotay2, thank you for the suggestion, but no animation support!

@Szkaradek123, thank you once again!! It seems to be working, but I'm noticing that the models seem to jitter around on the first animation set, but not the others? Is this something you can fix? [ma_0119_00_00.xsm for the basilisk per example]

Here is another batch of samples: [https://mega.co.nz/#!Nk9DjBxC!7K-jSA-QR ... WzFO_BpODI](https://mega.co.nz/#!Nk9DjBxC!7K-jSA-QRph2qyXz-ejyWx0jZRrg6YbZxWzFO_BpODI)

i'm trying to use that but, the blender keeps saying: "Error: Python script console error: check console" and when i click on it select this line:

```
import newGameLib
```
