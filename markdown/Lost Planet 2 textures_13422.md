First post here, sorry if wrong section.
Now, I am currently trying to extract LP2 models, but I cannot find a way to convert the textures. Does anyone here know how to convert the LP2 tex format?

Yes, I saw that thread. That is why I posted here. I have no idea how to actually do it.

You can try Sectus's arc-tool, maybe it will convert textures into .dds on the fly. If not, post here some .tex files, I can make Noesis plugin for them.

Thanks for the suggestion on the arc-tool, but it does not seem to be working.
Heres one of the textures:

Sorry for the external link, but the board would not let me post the original file.

Okay, I have beta plugin for Noesis now, but you should send me more textures (normal maps, specular) at least 10-20, one isn't enough. In Capcom games they usually *_bm,*_nm,*_sm you will figure them out by name

EDIT: Can anyone send me few .tex files as a sample? I don't want to download entire game lol Then, I'll attach Noesis plugin for textures here

Here's plugin, all textures you provided loaded fine. Test it on other textures you have and those which wouldn't work send to me!

Thank you for this, I will test it now. Should any problem arise, I will let you know, although, hopefully no major complications will occur.

There does not seem to be any major problems, found this so far:

[http://www.mediafire.com/download/f5r8z ... u/wp01.rar](http://www.mediafire.com/download/f5r8zivm6jhzc5u/wp01.rar)

There are others but hopefully they can be solved via proxy.

Now all we need is for noesis to properly extract the .MOD files too, but I will not ask you to do this, you already have done a lot!

He actually wrote a script for that, still haven't tried it myself so I can't say how well it works. I'll have to take a look at it sometime.

Yes, I am currently using the maxscript, however there are some issues: All models are about the same size, meaning every one of them needs individual resizing with unique values. And all models are exported textureless. This is all probably the game engine's fault though.

I have been using the MAXscript to check out the LP2 models, but I have ran into several models that fail to open. Many other models are improperly loaded, and large amounts of those models are reduced into square rubbish in the origin point. Some of the sections I have trying to load failed completely.

P.S. Report bugs, I tested a lot of models, but because of lack of HDD space, deleted the game. It's possible,  that some models could cause troubles - but if you report them, I'll fix script ASAP.
As I said here I didn't test this game well, but since there was no other reports I was sure it's fine. Are you using PC version?

Here is a sample. Some models in there work, others fail to load.

VERY sorry for resurrecting this thread, but I am trying to open a bunch of textures and they just fail to load:

Can someone find a solution for this? It would be massively appreciated.
