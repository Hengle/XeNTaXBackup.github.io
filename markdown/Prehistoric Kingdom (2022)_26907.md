- Post Title: Prehistoric Kingdom (2022)

Hi!
Has anyone tried to extract 3D models and textures from the game Prehistoric Kingdom?
Game create In Unity. I have downloaded the game archives. Can anyone help unpack open dinosaur 3d models in blender.
They look great in the game... It would be nice to import them with animation into blender.
