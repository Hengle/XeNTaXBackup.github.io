Me and a friend of mine are trying to extract the dead space necromorph models with the models animations. But we do not know what tool or tools we would need to do so. Any insight or help would be much appreciated. Thanks in advance.

You should use the search function before posting thread like this. You shouldn't expect an immediate response ether. Give it at least a day or two, this is a pretty slow site.
