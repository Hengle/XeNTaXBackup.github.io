- Post Title: scorpions disfigured

I've recently been dunking around with a relatively cheap game, but with some decent models. The data and textures are quite easy to get to. Sadly the models themselves don't use some common format.

As far as I can see the SG are the animation and skeletal data, wheras the GM's are the mesh data themselves.
