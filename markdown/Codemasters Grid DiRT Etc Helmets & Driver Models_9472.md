- Post Title: Codemasters Grid DiRT Etc Helmets & Driver Models

Hello everyone,

I've searched these forums for info regarding these types of PSSG files and found a few topics, but I can't really fathom any of it out; also, a lot of those posts are quite old, so I'm curious as to whether or not anyone's been able to work anything out.

Basically, the models of the driver figures and helmets etc are stored as PSSG files, however, 3DSimEd is unable to open them, along with any PSSG utility I've tried. I'm wondering if there's a particular method of doing this, please?  I'd like to work on helmet and suit designs, but it's too difficult without having the model there to look at when the changes are made; you have to keep going in and out of the game all the time.

I hope someone can help!

Many thanks,

Drummer.
