- Post Title: 3DR to Blender?

I don't have 3DS Max (nor do I plan on getting it) and I want to get 3D Ripper DX's .3DR files imported into a recent version of Blender. Any ideas, guys? the OBJ's are obviously very skewed... I found a script which was made for Blender 2.48, though obviously it won't work on any recent version.

well you could always just get the older blender version and export it there, if it even is in that version
