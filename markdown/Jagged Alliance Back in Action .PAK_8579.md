I've published a Unpakke module for the game at [http://nullsecurity.org/unpakke/](http://nullsecurity.org/unpakke/) 
Of course, like every other module for Unpakke, you can both unpack or pack the archives.

In the next few days I'll also release a crypt/decrypt tool for "configs_win32.pak.crypt" and "configs_win32.pak.crypt", so stay tuned and happy modding!

I found that info by myself already, don't worry.
But since you posted a BMS script for it i don't need to finish my tool anymore.

Edit:
I decided to release my crypt/decrypt tool anyway. You can find it at [http://www.nullsecurity.org/gametools/](http://www.nullsecurity.org/gametools/)

I found a whole toolset [here](https://github.com/sbobovyc/JA-BiA-Tools). It allows editing interface files (ctx, cui, deg) in addition to pak files.

Thank you both!
