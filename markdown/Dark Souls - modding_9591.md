It's certainly moddable, the main issue right now is delivering new file content without having to rebuild the two >GB archives.

I wonder how much, it could use some rebalancing and new spells.
why is that?

what about extracting models/anims?

There was some progress with models but most of the format is still unknown.

Models are the same format as the console version, and neither have had too much progress I think.

Some nice maps were exported though.

Well the guy making dsfix has plans to make his wrapper load textures from an extra folder, so that's something.
That said, he has a ton of plans for different things that'll take some time, so who knows when he'll get to that.

Edit: Just as an update, he added that feature 3 days after that post: [http://blog.metaclassofnil.com/?tag=dsfix](http://blog.metaclassofnil.com/?tag=dsfix)

I wonder if only aesthetic mods will be possible or others too.
