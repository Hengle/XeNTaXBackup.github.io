Here are the files that I would like to be looked into. We really need a script to extract .bpe files and others but exclusively for WWF SD!2 Know Your Role. I have uploaded three PAC files that contain head, body, and leg textures. It would be great if we could re-import the textures back into the game. 

Here are the pac files:

Progress:

So i've been looking for tools that can possibly help me find those texture files of wrestlers in game. I found the X-Packer tool on this site and tried it out with a few pac files from the game. I've managed to extract files that look like this

2.´´¶«
3.¦!«"­#¬

I extracted them through the texture archive in X-Packer. I'm just not sure where to go from there. I've also looked at alot of the pac files in hex editor and have found that BPE files are very present. I could really use some help on this guys.

I've been exploring. So could anyone tell me where to go from here lol or pick it up from here lol
