- Post Title: Battlefield 3 weapons files??[*.soldierweaponbundle]

I have unpack some BF3 Files(X360 version), and got some files with NO EXTENSION in Weapons.toc and Weapons.sb.
They are called, Example:(aek971_soldierweaponbundle),(m40a5_soldierweaponbundle)etc.
So, are these files called "xxxxxxxx.soldierweaponbundle" or "xxxxxxxx_soldierweaponbundle"????  
Most of this files are larger than 1MB, so that I think these files are including most of the resource of guns.
could someone make a script to unpack these files????
MANY THANKS!!!!!!!!  
Here are all the "soldierweaponbundle" files I have found(Just 49.06MB, don't worry  ):
