Well here is an interesting game.
It's a simple 3D fighter written in D.

The game comes with all of the source code along with instructions for building it (lol)
The models are stored in plain XML. Anyone could probably find the function that parses it also.

I think is it quite interesting to see how a game like this is programmed.

Maybe someone will challenge themselves and try to put in some hi-quality models
