- Post Title: I WAS able to pull EVERY model out of Valkyria Chronicles!

Well it sucked because I had all the models waiting for my 3D printer ready to be used and printed. Even though I didn't have one at the time, I knew I was getting one and had them all stored and backed up. Then a witch came along *ex-fiance* and fried my HDD along with all my memories. I was able to get EVERY VC model out of the game and need help getting it back. Especially because now I have a high end almost industrial 3d printer so I could really use the help. Even if that means you may have some of the models in .obj format as opposed to the game; or in any format for that matter.

SO I have Blender
I think I have the import Valkyria Plugin which I can't get to show up or forgot how to plug-it-in.
Along with CAD, ketchup, and meshlab etc...
along with my brand new 3d Printer I just need to use.

So can somebody, any good sumaritan out there help me! Or give me pointer? Or at least some 3d mod of Valkryian soldiers?
