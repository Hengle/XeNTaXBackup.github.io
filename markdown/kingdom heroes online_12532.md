Hi 

@shakotay2    
I saw this game format in World of Tanks too.

I tried model viewer for tanks but not working.
Here is importer for models from this game.
It requires Blender249 and Python26.
How to import:
1.unpack importer
2.run Blender249.blend
3.in Blender Text Window press alt+p and select visual files for textured meshes with skinweights and pose skeleton 

It don't imports bind skeleton, so meshes and skinweights don't match with pose skeleton.
I don't know how to find animations for models.

Thank you !
The script works in my case, ripping bigworld base game.
But it goes wrong with names of nodes,L or R in the wrong side.Can you fix it?
