hey guys, im new to this forum, and to the domaine too,
so basiclly, i know nothing like john snow,
so here is the thing
i wanna make a translation patch of the mmorpg game, revalation online for my language,
and the game files are .pg, 
luckily, i found the unpacker here,[viewtopic.php?f=10&t=14472](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=14472),
many thanks to Ekey,
but as i want to do a language patch, when i finished dealing with the files it unpacked,
