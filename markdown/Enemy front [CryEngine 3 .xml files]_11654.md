- Post Title: Enemy front [CryEngine 3 .xml files]

So as I've seen, Enemy Front uses the same mechanics for .xml files as Sniper Ghost Warrior 2.
I can unpack the .pak files with 7-zip or WinRAR, but how can I edit those .xmls? Are there any decryption programs for them?

I uploaded a simple file. Find original texts and paste the .xml file. Create a folder and rename; "Languages" to "Enemy Font\Game2" location. Paste the .xml files on Languages folder.
