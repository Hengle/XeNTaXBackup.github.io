- Post Title: PlayStation Home model extraction help

hello, i've been trying to figure out how to obtain models from this game for a while now, i've extracted the .pkg, then unpacked an archive file called "CHARACTERS.BAR" where I assume character models and costumes would be, but inside this now are a ton of .dds files, .ac1 files and .mr0 files and i'm pretty much stumped here, idk if these are further archives or the actual models in an uncommon format that just need a converter/importer or something, if anyone could take a look at these it would be appreciated
