Indeed you found some source to read this file. I should be able to make some sort of plugin for it.

I can not draw any texture. Apart from that I am not an expert (I'm a newbie) also speak the language and the translator does not work on these issues. I have downloaded lots of tools but only get to the files with "g_peg_pc". Long ago, someone explained to me and I could extract hundreds of archives of SR2 but now I am unable. Can anyone help me? thanks

No and no.

1st no: No it doesn't work on 360.

2nd no: He really doesn't care if it doesn't work as he doesn't care for the 360 or PS3. He does have support for big-endian in the compiler, but whether it makes the slightest difference is unknown.
