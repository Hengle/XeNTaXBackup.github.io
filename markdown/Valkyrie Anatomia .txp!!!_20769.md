- Post Title: Valkyrie Anatomia .txp!!!

I am looking at the textures from a mobile game called Valkyrie Anatomia, but I couldn't find the image format used. .txp textures all have the "GLTP" (0x5) tag near the beginning, followed by image width and height (2 bytes each). There is also the texture name at 0x30. I don't know what other values in the header should mean. Texture names have ".tga" in them, so these might actually be targa images. Still file names can be deceiving 

I am hoping someone more experienced can take a look. I have attached 2 .txp samples.

Thank you.
