- Post Title: Pursuit Force: 3D-File Formats

Hey guys,
a couple minutes ago user DKDave created a BMS-Script to unpack the ALL.PAK - Archive within the games files: [viewtopic.php?f=10&t=21337](https://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=21337)

All files come out named and packed in folders. So it was pretty easy to find the models. Whats weird though is that weapons, vehicles and characters seem to use different file formats:


 Pursuit Force Examples.zip
(173.7 KiB) Downloaded 22 times



Characters: .CHPSP & .ANP (???)


Vehicles: .PSPPVE


Weapons: .PSPP3D



I added a screenshot of every example file I uploaded.
With all that being said: I was hoping that the file formats might be known, since they got "psp" in their name.....I know.....but I have hope 
I kindly wanna ask anyone with the right knowledge to take a look at it and maybe provide me with a quickbms or noesis script to convert the files 
Thank you for reading
