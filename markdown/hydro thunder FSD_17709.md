- Post Title: hydro thunder FSD

Hello,
Here I come with a small (65mB) file to extract, it's from an EUROCOM game named Hydro Thunder that came out a long time ago now.
I'm here asking for help to extract the main file called by the exe:
The file has FSD extension. The extension is used by some other games, but nothing is working on this one.
This file must contain all the game materials such as graphics, textures, sound and any other.
The game folder only contain the EXE, a CFG file that is the saved game, and this FSD file.

But i can't find any clue on how this works... 
Here is a screenshot showing in HEX that there are clearly files listed:

I join the file that I would like to look at. I zipped it with 7zip. Let me know if anything else is needed.

And in case it may be needed, here is the exe:
