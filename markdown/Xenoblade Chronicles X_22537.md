- Post Title: Xenoblade Chronicles X

Hey guys, I have been trying to figure out for a while how to get the models from a game called Xenoblade Chronicles X for the Wii-U. 
I am currently using Cemu and I have seen people use tools for BotW but I haven't been able to make those work for this game. 
The files are .cpk if that helps.
