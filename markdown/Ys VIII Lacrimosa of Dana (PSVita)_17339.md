- Post Title: Ys VIII Lacrimosa of Dana (PSVita)

Hey Everyone,

I came across the following tool online that could extract from the "rootast.xai" file from Ys VIII Lacrimosa of Dana
Tool: [https://github.com/yosh778/YsVIII-tools](https://github.com/yosh778/YsVIII-tools)

Inside of the character folder and map folder are it3 files, which is a standard falcom format, having been used in most of the previous Ys games, however the it3 tool that works for those doesn't work for the Ys VIII it3 files. the tool is just called it3cnvrt, sadly its only an exe, no source.

The it3 file layout appears to be quite different in Ys VIII when I compare it to previous Ys games.

It'd be great if someone could take a look at it.

I've collected a few environments and character models for anyone who might be able to have a go at it.

Thankyou.

In my defense, this is from 2 years ago :p
But I've uploaded some from the PC version here for you.

From what I remember of the vita version, these are basically the same files, its just these aren't in the archive that the vita required.
If you need more files please let me know.
Thankyou for taking a look at this.

It's been over a year, I've removed all the files sorry.
It would be easier to get the files from the PC version though.
the PC versions textures are all DDS files (if you get the free HD Texture pack the company offers for player), it's only the models that're still unknown.

6 years later, we finally got a tool that unpacks Ys VIII (and IX) it3 files.

[https://github.com/eArmada8/Ys8_IT3](https://github.com/eArmada8/Ys8_IT3)

Sorry, did I say tool? I meant tools since we got two of them here, so pick what you want. Sadly, there still isn't a way to repack them just yet. Even if it just lets you repack the textures files into the it3, it would be pretty useful.
