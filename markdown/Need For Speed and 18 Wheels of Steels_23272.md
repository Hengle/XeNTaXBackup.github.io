- Post Title: Need For Speed and 18 Wheels of Steels

Hello everyone,

I am making games as a hobbyist. I want to make a remake for 18 WoS (Wheels of Steel) Haulin and Need for Speed U2 (Underground 2). I've two questions.
1. 18 WoS:
I can open 18 WoS's models with ZModeler except the road network. I think, the road network is created with a custom tool. So, it is not a single mesh. Is there a method to export whole road network to .OBJ format?
2. NFS U2:
I've tried to use nfsu360's mod tools ([https://nfs-tools.blogspot.com/](https://nfs-tools.blogspot.com/)). I can open car models with it but I can't export. Car models are not important but I want to export the map. Is there a method to export Underground 2 or Most Wanted (2005) map to an .OBJ file? 

Even only road models are enough to me because I will use them as a reference when I rebuilding the maps.

Thanks in advance.

Publicly available no, there is no current tool. In private is another story and yes there is one by same author nfsu360 called NFS-Toolkit that its been worked on it for a few years and said he will upload it on his blog but never did, everyone has doubts he will ever do that though, and no one even knows why, anyway.
I think it supports all 7 games on the EAGL/Speed engine by now.
NFSUG, NFSUG2, NFSMW05, NFSC, NFSPS, NFSUC and NFSWO.
This was last update about it: [https://nfs-tools.blogspot.com/2019/01/ ... e-map.html](https://nfs-tools.blogspot.com/2019/01/nfs-toolkit-nfs-world-sample-map.html)

Your best bet is to try NinjaRipper except 90% of assets are centered and you have to manually place them in the 3D space thus making it tedious and can take more than 2 years to finish.
Or use 3D Ripper DX and can dump what ever you see on the screen BUT because it uses the game's FOV during capture everything you import in 3dsMax will be skewed thus making geometry look like crap, and it imports entire capture centered as well, and if you want to capture another frame its centered as well and you still have to stitch everything manually, so yeah, there are options but neither of them is productive in any way shape or form.

Hello,

Thank you for your reply.
I think, in this case my best option is extract the minimap images as a reference and trust my eyes.
