Due to low-lives that think spamming is fun, we are confronted with new "members" that wish only to drop their filthy messages here. 

Therefore, registration is still open for anyone, but Admin approval is needed to be able to post anything. 

People who wish only to read stuff are still welcome to register, yet won't be able to post anything unless they specifically request so. 

To become an active member you should:

1. Register normally at this forum

2. Fill in the Reaon To Join line in the registration form. 

Give a valid reason why you wish to become an active member. This needn't be high-profile or lenghty, just show you are human and not some spammer. 

Good luck!

Very good Mr.Mouse, hopefully they will not adapt to this new defense. Slight borg reference there.

And it's working too. We probably have to make it more clear to new users that they have to do the above, but we haven't had any spamming posts anymore.

Okay, so I adapted the registration form so people can already provide a small line explaining why they want to join. This will be forwarded to the Admin to decide whether the account will be activated. So there's no need to send an additional mail.

Just registered this account today but didn't see a "reason" line, even after enabling Javascript. So is the reason line no longer needed, or did I just screw something up somehow? (Guess I'll find out from whether this goes through or not...)

edit: yea, it works
