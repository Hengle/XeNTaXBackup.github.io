Any method to extract the files buried inside? Checked around and didn't see a whole lot of information about getting the music out of it.

You should be able to extract the files with my tool ([http://tmacdev.com](http://tmacdev.com)) but chances are you wont be able to play them just yet. I'll add audio support to the list of features I need to add  .

Awesome! Yeah, I was able to extract some of the contents but wasn't able to get any info on what filetypes they were. I played with some headers but couldn't manage to get any sound out of them but hopefully it's just for the time being. Thanks for the quick reply too!
