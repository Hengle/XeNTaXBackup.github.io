- Post Title: Fallout 76

Hey y'all! 

Tried to import Fallout 76 models into blender, but ran into some bumps. Noesis refuses to export the .nif files, and as far as I'm aware there's no .nif importer that works with Fallout 76 .nif files, which is why I'm creating this thread, because I feel that despite the game's reputation it still is worth cracking into and experimenting with models as they honestly don't look half bad for an outdated engine. 

So if anyone has or can make a patch for the Noesis script, that would be wonderful, but if there's an alternate solution I would love to know! Thanks!

maybe use forum search instead of creating "new threads on the same subject"?

ah, sorry 'bout that. Thanks for the link, though, it looks... quite complex, but hey, something is infinitely better than nothing, right?
