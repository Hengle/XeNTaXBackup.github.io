- Post Title: Extracting Textures From Poker Night 2?

I've been busy trying to extract some textures from Poker Night 2 (I want to try and replicate the cards and chips IRL). However, I've run into difficulty accessing the textures for the chips. Every time I attempt to access them in TellTale Explorer, I get the "DDS Decode failed!" error. Any ideas on what could be causing this? I checked, and every other texture appears to be working fine.
