- Post Title: TIM2

I have a huge file that's about 1GB. It has Tim2 files in it. However, I cannot see to find any programs or BMS  that will rip the TIM2 from the file or script. Anyone know where I can find them?

I tired Jaeder Nnaub v2.20a and I get error "Length Error (bug)!". So, I'm assuming it's a bug?
