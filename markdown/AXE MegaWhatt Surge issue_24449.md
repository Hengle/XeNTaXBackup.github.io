- Post Title: AXE MegaWhatt Surge issue

Hi guys! I've got AXE working now! And it's good I had to make sure the files are in their respective folders, so I would like to get help from Bigchillghost with the file: "Megawhatt_Surge____0000000.et_decomp" in AXE.

I hope I get help from Bigchillghost and I will, ahem. sorry XeNTaX mods and admins. I actually do need help from Bigchillghost with AXE. since I've started working on AXE "Advanced Mesh Reaper - Xtreme Version".
Thanks and I'll be back soon if there's a resolution

Haven't got a single reply. (this isn't spam but this is a message of not getting a reply from Bigchillghost though, i'm sorry!)
