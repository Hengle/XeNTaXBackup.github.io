Hi 

It seems that Dead Space 3 game uses .dll files for language files. Does anyone know how can I open that ?

Those .dll files are part of the protection system, or something like that, not contain game texts at all.

You mean Viv Unpacker right? When I try to install it it says it doesnt sport windows NT .. I have win 7 i dont understand why it does that

Edit: Ok somehow I managed to install it but this time it gave different error. This time it says : invalid header error code 0x1106
