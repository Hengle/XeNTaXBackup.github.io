I was able to write a program to extract the file folder structure, based in other programs that already exist for similar file formats:



Working on the remaining files.

Here it is: [https://mega.co.nz/#!aUoVgCRZ!Lky2fG5HO ... sTtvqpAUUQ](https://mega.co.nz/#!aUoVgCRZ!Lky2fG5HOGviXOOwBrdsxxBVhHJhFSrkfsTtvqpAUUQ)

To use it simply run "packer Target" in the command line.

The code is manly the NDS_Atlus_Packer-CUE, but the table file is now divided in entries of 7 bytes, instead of 6. The tool only unpacks files, doesn't repack them as the original tool. If you want, I can try to take a look at that.

Here it is: [https://mega.co.nz/#!rMowna4Z!BSrEQ2w6N ... OqhQkRED6g](https://mega.co.nz/#!rMowna4Z!BSrEQ2w6NbverSGXHNIxzPrU1mhi5jxKGOqhQkRED6g).

It's the same core code of the CUE script, with some small modifications due to the table entry size, that is now 7 bytes.

I extracted and repacked the Target bin that you sent me and it worked, so I think that it's all alright with the script.

Hello! Can anyone tell me how can i unpack & repack target.bin
I saw this post [viewtopic.php?t=12671](https://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?t=12671) before, but the download link was down.

So have anyone still save this tool?
I tried original ATLUS packer, It doesn`t work.

Hi! I noticed that the link with the program that ekanspt made had gone down, and I was able to remake the program. I just changed the 6 in the code of NDS_Atlus_Packer-CUE to a 7, and it seems to work. I don't actually know C so this might not work for everyone but for me it seems to work perfectly on the files of Devil Survivor Overclocked. I attached my files to this post, first time posting on Xentax so I hope it works 

Edit: I made a version that also works on Devil Survivor 2: Record Breaker by removing the line of code that checked if the file is too big! Because with the 7 byte long indexes instead of 6 the files can be bigger like the Record Breaker one is

It doesn`t work perfectly with DSOC`s target.bin, then i repack this, it just said Offset too big, can you send first edited version? Thanks!
