- Post Title: [help] PS1 TIM image format with 16 color palettes

hello people of XeNTaX forms, ive been enjoying extracting images from ps1 games for some time now, for my own personal use, but ive come across some games that have 16 palettes per image and when i extract them, they don';t look correct, like the programs i use to extract them ether makes 16 images with each of there own palette, or makes 1 image and looks all screwed up, here are some pictures of examples, also the programs i use to extract with are jpsxdec, psmplay, psxmc, psx multi rip, tim viewer, each of these programs do the same thing or similar.

all these images are the same just different palettes, i was wondering if there was a way to convert a ps1 tim format and keep all the palette in one? or maybe even some how merge them all, i really don't know what to do if anyone could help would be much appreciated

This style of palettes can't be merged in any windows style file format. Switchable palette? Nope. What you wanna do with those anyway? This display is entirely correct. I mean p00 is just a vga and 09 and 10 seem unused or broken. It's all good.
