Hey There

I'm trying to convert these music files from both Build-a-Bear Wii games, but they both come in .mus files and I have tried the EA Trax method from HCS64 and it didn't work, so I was wondering if anyone else had any luck converting files from the games?

Here you go: [http://www.mediafire.com/?45xt9d1k4ozaarl](http://www.mediafire.com/?45xt9d1k4ozaarl) There's a sample file from the first game in the series and I'm sorry for forgetting to upload a file

You could always use VGMToolbox's GENH Tool to slap on a header that vgmstream can read easily.

I'm looking at the GenH tool, but I'm a little confused on which option does what, is there a tutorial on how to use it as for when I try to use it, I get nothing but static
