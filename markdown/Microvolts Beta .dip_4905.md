- Post Title: Microvolts Beta .dip

Hey,

Well i got a beta key for Microvolts. ( [http://www.microvolts.com/](http://www.microvolts.com/) )
And i looked a bit at the files contained.
And there's one strange file.
So i opened it with HxD and had a look at it.

Stuff i already found out.
- 1st 2 bytes are always "PK"
- then 16 bytes of stuff i can't figure out.
- then 4 bytes = length of the data when packed
- next 4 bytes = length of the data when unpacked
- and the next 4 bytes indicating the length of the filename.

I already tried using QuickBMS but i don't get it right.

Could someone please help me

This is soooo easy: rename to zip! But encrypted.

I checked thedat files against this theory but the header with pk didnt exists but the end structure is the same!
