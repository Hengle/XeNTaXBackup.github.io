Encode binary string from the array of the size. Unzip to automate the extraction of source codes of a fixed point, the default is src or / tmp, make sure the package creates its own subdirectory. Index was created based on the package file name, if you do not. Pure is written in Perl and developed for Linux but should work without modification on most Unix-based GNU tar installed.
