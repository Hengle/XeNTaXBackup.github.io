- Post Title: [REQUEST] Hitman: Codename 47 Texture Tool

Hi, I was wondering if anyone here could design a tool/script for replacing Hitman: Codename 47 textures?

The [file formats](https://github.com/AlexKimov/hitman-file-formats) and their structures have already been [documented](http://www.watto.org/game_extractor.htmls) to some extent on a few sites, but it hasn't been put to use.

It's strange that the image filetypes inside the file archives have extensions .NLAP .ABGR .1TXD and .3TXD.
Those are obviously the reverse of common TGA/DDS image types .PALN . RGBA .DXT1 and .DXT3.

I don't know if requests are allowed here or not, this is my first time posting  I'd greatly appreciate if anyone can help with this
