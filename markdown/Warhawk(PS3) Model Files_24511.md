- Post Title: Warhawk(PS3) Model Files

Good Evening!

Would any of you fine forum goers be willing to give me the "what for" with these files?  

I currently have a small team trying to refresh Warhawk onto a modern game Engine.  I have been working with the RPCS3 version but do not have the time to play to unlock all of the character Model pieces!  

We are completely prepared to re-create the original models from as many reference images as possible... That being said: reference images are scarce at best online (unless I missed something).

Tried to change rank within RPCS3 files so-as to unlock all skins for screen-shots, found this forum hoping to be able to edit them only getting the kasploosh of unrecognized file formats, then finding out I may be able to get models?

PSN Unlocks are incomplete on PS3 as well... leveling difficult w/ no servers.

So I either need to crack these files for stat alteration, grab models themselves, or find screenshot city.

Any help is greatly appreciated!

P.S.: Tried to upload the data00.psarc file I got from the Warhawk file, but it doesn't like me.  I got the game from Vimm's Lair.
