- Post Title: WARP (PC) Font file(s)

WARP was released yesterday (if i'm not wrong), but the game doesn't support other languages than English and if someone want to translate the game, he needs to edit the font file(s) but the problem is that the game is using Unreal Engine and the game files are in .u, .upk archives.

First the files need to be unpacked, edit the font files (if they are in .dds format) and repack the archive again (it's hard for me because i don't understand from scripting and coding   )

Is there anyone who is worked enought with the Unreal Engine's archives and who can help with unpacking/repacking the font files?

I'll be so happy if anyone help me (and not only me because i'm not the only one here) to do this because the game is really good for me.

Nevermind, i think that the fonts are in this file but i'm not sure if they are there...

Here are that file ( [http://www.mediafire.com/?tlkhmtikfq7m4ci](http://www.mediafire.com/?tlkhmtikfq7m4ci) ) and if they aren't there, just PM me or write here so i can upload all the other files.

Big thanks in advance.
