It is a Xbox ADPCM audio file, try to read it with xbadpdec or the codec for Media Player or with my Winamp plugin:

From what game have you got it?
I didn't know this extension (probably the real name of this type of audio?) so I'm very interested in it.

Sorry I did the wrong question... can you provide a list of all the files in this game?
file.XSS contains all the available audio data in a sequential mode (just a stream, not an archive) so should exist another file containing all the filenames or at least their offsets.

Okay, so the pairs are indeed data + index, the other's don't help (at first glance) with the streams.xss.

I'm a big Jesper Kyd fan, and would like a rip version of this score, as the only one available currently (like with Splinter Cell 1 and 2) is a recording from within the game.
