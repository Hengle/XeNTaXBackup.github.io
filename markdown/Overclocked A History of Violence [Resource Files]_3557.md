These files are definitely zlib and I am guessing they are split archives with that map file being compressed table of contents.
offzip gets some of the files out of each of those archives and I can see item descriptions and effects.
I am not good at figuring out the size of zip files when it is not given so I can't decompress that map file but I bet it is easy to write a script once that is decompressed.
you might be able to grab a decompressed version from ram while the game is running then you could post the file table and that could help.
Sorry I was not more help.

I have been unable to decompress the .map file. I keep getting mem error (-4). They have done something fishy to that thing.

I have problems with my Overclocked. I can't successfully copy the resource.200.
Can someone upload this file? Thank you!

So, is there anyone who solved this problem? I would like to have music from this game ripped.
