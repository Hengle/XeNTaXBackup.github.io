- Post Title: Rage 2  dropzone Problem

I translated the Rage 2 game into Turkish and applied the Dropzone mod method, but the voices and subtitles of the characters in the cutscenes are not visible, with or without a language patch, they disappear when I add this additional command line information, how do I solve this?

Additional command line text:
"--vfs-fs dropzone --vfs-archive archives_win64 --vfs-archive archives_win64\initial --vfs-archive archives_win64\initial\languages --vfs-archive archives_win64\initial\languages\eng --vfs-archive archives_win64\supplemental --vfs-archive archives_win64\supplemental\languages --vfs-archive archives_win64\supplemental\languages\eng --vfs-fs."

Sorry but I can't help with your problems but:

Can you share with us how could you translate this game, and the tools of course -- it would be huge help for us!
