- Post Title: Xenoblade ADX and AHX

I want to extract the audio files from these file formats and I am unable to. I have the AHX2WAV.exe and when I run it, it does nothing. Same with ADXTRACT2. I extracted the entire Xenoblade ISO folder. I don't know what I'm doing wrong.

EDIT: 

Haha! Never mind! I needed to drag the file into the exe!

Alyzabeth, you can also use vgmstream for playing adx and ahx files in winamp and xmplay.
