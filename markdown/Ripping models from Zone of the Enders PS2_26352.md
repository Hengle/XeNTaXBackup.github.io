- Post Title: Ripping models from Zone of the Enders PS2?

Hi, I want to extract the models from Zone of the Enders 2nd Runner but all the files of the game are stored in .dat files. I've never extracted from .dat files so I'm confused how it works, it looks like everything is basically in one .dat file too. Any help is appreciated

If you don't urgently need the models from PS2 I'd suggest to have a look at these from the PC demo:

This is something that I have been working on for a while.
There are no good tools for getting models from the PS2 version.

The post shakotay2 is linking to only works for the VR models, not the orbital frames.

The best way I have found for the PC/Xbox version is:
Ripping process: 
1. Download Xenia and the Xbox 360 version of the Zone of the Enders HD collection.
2. Unpack the Xbox 360 ISO.
3. Copy ZoE2_ProjectFinal.xex from the extracted root folder to the ZOE2 folder.
4. Launch Xenia using Ninja Ripper 2.
5. Open ZoE2_ProjectFinal.xex using Xenia.
6. See this video for ripping Xenia using NR2 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAupum_kNNk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAupum_kNNk)
7. Use the pac extraction methods in the file types section or NR2 with the PC version and codex crack to get the PC version textures.
8. Unatlas/seperate the applicable PC version texture/s into pieces and apply them to the 360 model, this is a very manual and time consuming process and some meshes have multiple textures. 

General Notes:
Based on what I have been able to rip, the models in the PC, PS2, Xbox 360 and PS3 versions are the same, with the same or simular UVs.
ZOE 2 Mars uses Denuovo DRM, so for programs like ninjaripper to work you have to use a crack which disables Denuovo, like the Codex crack.

I'll try this out, thank you.    I tried doing the stuff for the PC version the other person linked to but honestly wasnt able to figure it out at all and got nowhere.

I think you misunderstand.
This is not a easy or quick process, it involves a lot of time and manual effort to unatlas the texture and match it to parts of the model.
If you have little experience with 3D work, textures and ripping, then I reccomend that you do not try this.

There's even pictures for explanation:

Sorry, I didn't mean anything about it not working, I just don't really have a lot of experience with hex stuff so I wasn't able to follow through with it, the method with the Xbox models is going to be way easier for me to work with for what experience I have.
