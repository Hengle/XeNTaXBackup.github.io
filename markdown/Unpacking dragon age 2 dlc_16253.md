- Post Title: Unpacking dragon age 2 dlc

So i am trying to decrypt the dlc (which i can prove i own if anyone cares about that) and everything i have found points to files from 5 years ago that have been taken down since then. Does anyone have any other methods to do it or downloads to the deda2drm.exe/slurpda2.exe? sorry in advance if this isn't the best forum topic to post in
