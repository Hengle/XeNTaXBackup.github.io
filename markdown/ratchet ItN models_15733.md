- Post Title: ratchet ItN models

Hi, i would like to know if someone could help me ripping models from "Ratchet & Clank into the nexus". Ps3 videogame.
They told me that the models are inside a file called mobys.dat. Unluckily have found so many mobys.dat files that cant find the models I want. Also for some reason cant open the .dat files. Have tried Noesis but didnt work. If someone could help I would appreciate it. Thanks.

Use the second script here [viewtopic.php?f=10&t=11872&p=97926&hili ... ern#p97926](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=11872&p=97926&hilit=irb+pattern#p97926) with quickbms to extract irbs from dat files.

(numbered files, no filenames so far, sry)

Then use Gh0stBlade's python script fmt_ratchetandclank_irb_1_5.py with Noesis on irb files.
