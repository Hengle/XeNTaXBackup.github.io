- Post Title: Rainbow Studios .DXT - conversion? (PC version files)

hello, I am trying to look for a way to convert DXT from Rainbow Studios games - more specifically Cars the Video Game, I am looking to extract models but I am focusing on textures for now.

So it appears someone has made tools to convert for this game before...such as DXT2DDS, but the link on the website is 404, does anybody still have that tool?   

Here's DXT: [https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/ ... d_Body.dxt](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/955162464406880337/956332589424201798/7Sed_Body.dxt)
