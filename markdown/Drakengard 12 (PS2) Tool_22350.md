- Post Title: Drakengard 1/2 (PS2) Tool

Tool for extracting models and textures from Drakengard 1/2 on PS2. Only skinned models. Might work for some other Cavia games, but not tested. Also it isn't perfect. Some textures are not supported, and meshes have backfaces. You will need to use a shader with no culling.

Extracting Files
The file system is troublesome as with most PS2 titles. Download [DrakengardDec](https://www.mediafire.com/file/n561t8eo4w136in/DrakengardDec.rar/file). Drag and drop the correct BIN file on to it (IMAGE.BIN or D_IMAGE.BIN). It will extract all model related FPK files in a folder called Models.

Loading Models



How to use

Load

FPK: Loads models (skinned) in selected FPK file.
Textures will be loaded automatically if found/supported.

Export

NUX: Exports the model in custom binary format (.nux), intended to be loaded by Noesis. Noesis script for this format : NUX Script
Textures: Textures will be exported as PNG.
Note  : Models and textures will be exported into the folder Export.

Awesome, it worked really well. Will you ever add support for scenes?

I probably won't return to this format anytime soon.

Thank you a lot I mean it. I'd never thought someone would tackle Drakengard format


Say, is there any chance you could take a look to these three .fpk from Drakengard 2? It's more or less the same few textures which don't extract properly.

Hey. is there any way I can import the .fpk files into something like Unreal Engine with ease? So far I haven't found out how to import those files into anything whatsoever. Thanks in advanced!
