And where's the problem if you even have the c++ code for creating this archive?

There are free compilers around that can make binaries.

It would be easier if someone could recommend me a good and tiny one,
or - even better - could make the binaries for me! ^^
Me is a lazy noob!

The code you posted needs to be adjusted for it to be a generic dat file extractor/creator, as the main function just builds one from a "data" subfolder in the current folder. This is effort that I'm not sure people will want to do, if the only reason you won't do it yourself is mere lazyness..

Nevertheless, it should also not be too difficult a task. 

For convencience, I've attached the actual CPP file of your post here .

I tried to compile it, but all compilers I tried gave me errors. (C++ Bulider, LCC). Somebody help me, please! I aint a programmer.
