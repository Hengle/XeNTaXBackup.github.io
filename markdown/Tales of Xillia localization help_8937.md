- Post Title: Tales of Xillia localization help

I have no background in programming or anything, but I've wanted to try giving my copy of Tales of Xillia at the very least, a rough translation to help me get through the game.

I've used QuickBMS and chrrox's script (thank you very much for it) to extract the files from the TLFILE.TLDAT.
I found the script files (*.SDBJPN), however I noticed I got 818 of these, and each one contains maybe one or two lines of dialogue. Not only that, but some of them also have incredibly dense kanji that can't really be translated. I've more or less realized they seemed to be item names. 

I think I'm missing some script though. I was wondering if I have to extract the .SDBJPN files further, or if it's just that and the rest of the script is in a different format.

I saw this thread: [viewtopic.php?f=35&t=7973](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=35&t=7973)
however the person who started it hasn't seem to have updated his progress since Jan.
He definitely got somewhere with the menu, except I don't have a clue where the files for menu translation are. I'm also not sure how he managed to get it in game.

I'd also like to know if there's anything I have to do while translating this. I've got a good translation program already, but do I just translate, and paste the translation back into the file where the Japanese text was? Does the encoding matter? Do I just place the translated script files back into the folder, reimport it all, and all it well?

Sorry for all the questions, but I'm really all new to this. I've rummaged around google and this forum, but I've ended up getting a little more tangled up in what I'm trying to accomplish.
