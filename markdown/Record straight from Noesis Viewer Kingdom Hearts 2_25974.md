- Post Title: Record straight from Noesis Viewer? Kingdom Hearts 2

I've been coming back to this project for years with limited success- please help me. You're my only hope.

I am working with Kingdom Hearts 2 files in Noesis.  Usually, I can just get them right out of the KH viewer by saving a png sequence of the animation, but that's not working because the alpha layer doesn't show up correctly.

Is there a way to make a video or png sequence from what I see in the Noesis viewer? I don't want to use any other 3D programs. 

It looks amazing in the Noesis viewer and I can't make it look amazing in Blender.

I just want to be done. 

Thank you for your time, patience, and help!
