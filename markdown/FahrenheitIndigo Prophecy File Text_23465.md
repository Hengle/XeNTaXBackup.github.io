You can find scripts that can handle DAT and DBR files in this topic
[https://zenhax.com/viewtopic.php?t=2738#p15181](https://zenhax.com/viewtopic.php?t=2738#p15181)

You need quickbms for this [http://aluigi.zenhax.com/papers/quickbms.zip](http://aluigi.zenhax.com/papers/quickbms.zip)


There are also readable strings in your sample

So you can probably use total commander method [https://ikskoks.pl/searching-text-strin ... commander/](https://ikskoks.pl/searching-text-strings-using-total-commander/)
to find strings and translate them.

The last link in the thread that targeted the remastered version is offline. 
But [idmtool](https://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?t=1521) should still work for the original version (and it's not like you can't bump for help there anyway). 
They probably linked some of the scripts [here](https://zenhax.com/viewtopic.php?f=9&t=2738&start=20#p17969) though.
