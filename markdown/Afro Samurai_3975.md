- Post Title: Afro Samurai

In playing around with the Xbox360 SDK xbdecompress.exe I found that you can decompress assets for Afro Samurai too. What is now needed is to discover the model format. Here is the file so you can play around with. I think the '.vib' is the mesh format because I see faces in the hex, and ".txd" might be the textures.

Have fun

afrodroid_a_txd.7z (Possible Texture File)

afrodroid_a_vib.7z (Possible Mesh File)

If you are wondering these files came from the terrain/afrodroid/afrodroid_a/ folder.
