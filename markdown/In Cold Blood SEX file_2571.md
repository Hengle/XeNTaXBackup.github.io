Seems to be an archive, doesn't it?
The strings are preceded by some numbers that could be the offsets of the corresponding string. But I didn't test it.

Sorry Rheini, I didn't get your reply... so I'm on the wrong section of the forum ? 

Isn't the file compressed ?

can't find something that indicates compression. much plain text in there.
And look at that "m01_investigate_mine\office_building.SEX".
