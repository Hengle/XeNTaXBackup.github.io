Unity Engine Patch And Unpacker 2.2
By. MiRiKan

This will unpack .assets file for Modding.
Support Almost of Unity .assets FILES! (Unity 4 to Unity 5!)

This program need .net framework 4.5

How To Use
Just Drag and Drop, Easy to use.
Just Drag to this EXE file what .asssets file you wanna unpack or repack.
and type 1 for unpack. (program will create unpacked files, .txt file with data - do not delete it)
then check created folder, you can find many of files - unpacked, and patch folder.

EX: 8-TYPE_21-Monsters, in this file. 8 is a count of all unpacked files. TYPE_21 says type is 21. And Monsters is Name of file.

So if you wanna modding this file, edit it and replace it patch folder (also I recommend do not delete original unpacked file) 
LIKE THIS:

Name_of_File.Type.

Program will read when repacking this.

Unpacked files are original data - not decoded. But you can change or Modding it using the unity engine and Unity [Studio beta from Chipicao](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=11807)
It does not decode any images or texts because this is just for repacking and Modding.

sry my bad english, but it's very useful and will help you guys to modding games made by unity!

Great tool, but I have a problem.
When I unpacked the resources.assets of Wasteland2, most file's name were *-TYPE_*-NoNameFileDoNotEdit.

it doesn't matter that they have name or not.
what you need to do is just find anything that you wanna edit and change them.

It would be nice if it gave us some sort of feedback when it's repacking. I keep thinking it's frozen. Also, would it be possible to not have the asset bundle rebuild from 0kb and instead just replace the files in your patch? Some games have their .assets in the multiple GB and that will take forever to repack.

If that's just how it has to be done, I understand. Unity is crazy like that.

OK. this is another tool for edit TEXT from Unity .assets files, which is 49 type.

How to use:
that super easy, just drag 49 type file onto UnityType49_unpack.exe
then, this will create new txt file from original .49 file.
edit them what you want whatever,
After all of works, just drag txt file onto UnityType49_build.exe
this will create brand-new .49 type file.
*YOU HAVE TO MATCH TXT FILE'S NAME WITH ORIGINAL 49 TYPE FILE.

sry my bad english, but this will useful for translators! good luck!

*changed: unpack exe file (just little - no longer use Korean)
